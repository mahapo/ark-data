Don Juan Matus was an Indian wh o was born in Yuma, Ari zona. His father was a Yaqui Indian from S ono ra, Mexico, a nd his mother was presumabl y a Yuma Indian from Ari zona. Don J uan li ved in Arizona until he was ten years old . He was then taken by hi s father to Sonora, Mexico, where they were caught in the endemic Yaqui wars against the Mexicans. His father was kill ed , and as a ten - year - ol d child don Juan ended up in Southern Mexico, where he grew up with relati ves . At the age of twenty , he came in c o ntact with a maste r sorcer er. H is name was Juli a n Osori o. He introduc e d don Juan into a lineage of sorcer e rs that was pur ported to be twenty - five generation s lo ng. He was not an In dian at a ll , but the son of European immi grants to M exico. D on J uan rel ated to me t hat t he nagual J uli a n ha d been an a ctor, and that he was a dashing person - a raco nteur, a mime, adored by everybody, inf luentia l, commanding. In one of his theatrical t our s to the pro vi nces, the actor Julian Osori o fe ll under the inf luence of anoth e r nagual, Elias Ull oa, who transmitted to him the knowled ge of his lineage of sorcerers. Don Juan Matus, fol lowing the tradi tion of his li neage of shamans, taught some bod il y movements which he call ed magical passes to his tour disci ples: Taisha Abelar, Florinda Donner - Grau, Car ol Figgs , and mys elf. He taught them to us in the same spirit in which they had been fo r generati ons, w ith o ne n otable departur e: he elim inated the ex cess ive ri tual which had surrounded the teach ing and pe rfo rmance of those magica l passes for generation s. Don J uan's co mments in th is respect were that ritual had lost its impetus as new generation s of practi tion e rs became more inter este d in effi c iency and func tionalism. He reco mmended to me, however, that under no cir cumstances shoul d I talk about the magica l passes with any of his disciples or with people in general. H is reasons were that the magical passes pertain ed exclusively to each person, and that"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"their ef fect was so shatte ri ng, it was better j ust to practice them w itho ut discu ss ing them. Don Juan Matus tau ght me everythi ng he knew about the sorcer ers of his li neage. He stat ed, asserted, affi rmed, explain ed to me every nuanc e of his knowledge. Ther efor e , everything I say about the magical passes is a dir ect result of his instr uction. The magical passes were not invented. They were discovered by the shamans of don Juan's li neage who li ved in Mexico in anci ent times, whil e they were in shamanistic states of heightened awareness. The discovery of the m agical passes was qui te accid ental. It began as very simple quer ies about the nature of an incredible sensat io n of well - bein g that those shamans experienc ed in those stat es of heightened awareness when they held certain bodily positions, or when they moved their li m bs in some specific man ner. Thei r sensat io n of wel l - being had been so intense that their dri ve to repeat those movements in thei r normal awareness became the focus of all their endeavors. By all a ppearan ces, they succeeded in their task , and found themselves the possessors of a very complex series of movements that, when practiced, yielded them tremendous results in terms of mental and physical pro wess . In fact, the results of performing these movements were so dramatic that they call ed them magical passes. They tau ght them for generations only to shaman initiates, on a pe rs onal basis, fol lo wing elaborate ri tua ls and secret c eremonies. Don Juan M atus, i n tea ching the m agical passes , departed radica ll y from t radi tion. Such a departure forced don Juan to reformulate the prag matic goal of the magical passes . He presented this goal to me not so much as the enhancement of mental and physical balan ce, as it had been in the pas t, but as t he pra ctical p ossibility of redeployin g energy. He explain ed that such a departure was due to the inf luence of the two naguals who had p receded him. It was the beli ef of the sorcer ers of don Juan's li ne age tha t there is an inh erent amount of energy existing in each one of us , an amou nt w hic h is not subject to t he onslaughts of outside for ces for augmenting it or for decreas ing it. They beli eved that this quanti ty of energy was suffic ient to accomplish something which those sorcer e rs deemed to be the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"obsess io n of every man on Earth: breakin g the paramete rs of normal perception. Don Juan Matus was c onvin ced that our inc apa city to break those paramete rs was induced by our culture and soc ial m ilieu. He maintai ne d t hat our culture and soc ial m il ieu depl oyed every bit of our inherent ene rgy in ful filli ng esta bli shed behavioral patterns which didn't allo w us to' break those parameters of normal per cept io n. \"Why in the w orld would I, or anyone else, wan t to break th ose parameters?\" I aske d don Juan on one occasion. \"Breakin g th ose parameters is the unavo idable is sue of mank ind,\" he rep li ed. \" Breakin g t hem means the entrance into unthi nkable worl ds of ,1 pragmatic value in no way dif fe rent fro m the value of our wo rl d of everyday li fe.

For sorcerers, success is determin e d only by the a cce ss ibi lity or the inac cess ibili ty energy. \"Sinc e it is impo ss ible,\" he c onti nued, \"to a ugment our inherent energy, the only avenue open for the sorcer ers of ancient Mexico was the redepl oyment of that energy. For them, this pro cess of redeployment began w ith the magical passes, and the way they affected the p hysical body. \" Don Juan stress ed in every way possibl e, while imparting his inst ruc tion, the fact that the enor mous emphasis the shamans of his li nea ge 11 ad put on physical pro wess and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"mental well - b eing had lasted to t he present day. I was able to corroborate the truth of his stat ements b y observin g him and his fif tee n sorcer er - companions. Thei r supe rb physical and mental balance was the most ob viou s feature abo ut them. Don Juan's reply when I once aske d h im directly why sorcer ers put so m uch stock in the physical side of man was a total surpr ise to me. I had always thought that he himself was a spiri tual man. \"Shamans are not spiritual at a ll,\" he said. \"They are very practica l be ings. It is a we ll - known fact, however, that shamans are generall y regarded as eccentri c, or even insane. Perhaps that is what makes you think that they are spiritual. They seem insane because they are always trying to explain th ings that cannot be explain e d. In the cours e of such futil e attempts to give complete explanations t hat canno t be completed under a ny cir cumstances, they lo se all coherence and say inanities. \"You need a pliabl e body, if you want physical prowess and level headednes s,\" he went on. \"These are the two most impo rtant issues in the li ves of shamans, because they bri ng forth sobriety and pragmatism: the onl y indispensable requisites for enterin g into other realms of percep t io n. To navigate, in a genuine way, in the unkno wn necessitate s an attitude of d aring, but not one of recklessness . In ord er to esta bli sh a balance between audaci ty and recklessness , a sorcer er has to be extremely sober, cautious, skillf ul, and in superb phys ical condition.\" \"But why in superb physical condition, don Juan? \" I asked. \" Is n't the desire or the will t o jour ney into the unknown enough?\" \"Not in your piss y li fe!\" he repl ied rather brusquely. \"Just to conc eive faci ng the unkno wn - much less enter into it - requ ires guts of stee l, and a bod y that woul d be capabl e o f ho ldin g those guts . What would be the point o f being g utsy if you didn 't have mental al ertness, phys ical prowess , an d adequate muscles?\" "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" The superb physical condition that don Juan had stea dil y advocated fro m the first day of our ass oci ation, the product of th e ri go rou s execution of the magical passes , was, by all indications, the first step toward the redepl oyment of our inherent energy. Thi s redeployment of energy was, in don Juan's view, the most cru cial issue in the li ves of shamans, as well as in the li fe of any individual. Redepl oyment of ene rgy is a pro cess which c onsists of transporting, from one place to another, ene rgy which already exists within us. Thi s energy has been displ aced fro m centers of vitality in the bod y, which requ ire that displ aced energ y in ord er to bring for th a balan ce between mental alertness and physical prowess . The shamans of don Juan's li neage were deepl y engage d with the redeployment of their inherent ene rgy. Thi s invol vement wasn't an intellectual en deavor, nor was it the pro d uct of i nducti on or deduction, or lo gica l conclusio ns. It was the result of their ability to p ercei ve ene rgy .is it flowed in the uni verse. \"Tho se sorcer ers called this ability to percei ve energy a s it flo wed in the uni verse seeing,\" don Juan explained to me. \"They described seeing as a state of heightened awareness in which t he human body is capable of perceiving energy as a flow, a cur rent, a wind li ke vibrati on. To see energy as it flo ws in the uni verse is the pro duct of a momentary hal t of the sys te m of interpr etation p roper to human beings .\" \"What is this syst em of inter pretat io n, don Juan? \" I asked. \"The shamans of anci ent Mexico fou nd out, \" he replied, \"that every part of the human bod y is engage d, in one way or another , in tu rning this vibrat ory flow, this current of vibrati on, into some form of sensory input. The sum total of th is bombardment of sensory inp ut is then, through usage, turned into the sys tem of inter pretation that makes human bei ngs capable of perceiving the w orld the way they d o. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" \"To make this sys tem of inter pretation come to a halt, \" he went on, \"was the result of tremendou s discipline on the part of the sorcere rs of a nci ent Mexico. They ca ll e d this halt seeing, a nd made it the cornerstone one of their knowledge. To see energ y as it flo wed in the uni verse was, for them , an ess ential tool that they emplo yed in making their classifi cat ory schemes. Because of this capaci ty, for inst ance, they conc eived the total uni verse available to the percep t io n of human bein gs as an onion lik e affair, consistin g of thousands of layers. The dail y worl d of human bein gs , they beli eved, is but one such layer. Consequently, they also beli eved that other layers are not onl y accessible to human pe rcepti on, but are part of m an's natural her itage.\" A nother issue of tremendou s value in the knowledge of those sorcer ers, an issue which was also a consequen ce of their capaci ty to see energy as it flo wed in the universe, was the discovery of the huma n energetic c onfiguration. Th is human e nergetic configu ra tion was, for them, a conglomerate of energy fields agg luti nated together by a vibratory for ce that bound those energy fiel ds into a luminous ball of energy. For the sorcer ers of don Jua n's lineage, a human bein g has a n oblon g shape li ke an egg , or a rou nd shape li ke a ball. Thus, they ca ll ed them lumi nous eg gs or luminous balls. This sphere of lumi nos ity was consid ered by them to be our t rue self - t rue in the sense that it is ir reducible in terms of energy. It is ir redu cible be cause the totality of human resour ces ;i re engag ed i n the net of percei vi ng it dir ect ly as energy. Tho se shamans discovered t hat o n the back face of this l uminous bal l there is a p oi nt o f greater brilliance. They f igured out, through proce ss e s of obs erving energy directly, that thi s poi nt is key in the act of turning energy into sensory data and then inter preti ng it. For th is reason, they called it the ass emblage poi nt , and deemed that percep tion is ind eed ass embled there. They describ ed the ass e mblage poi nt as bein g lo cated behind the shoul de r blades, an arm's lengt h away fro m them. They also fou nd out that the ass emblage poi nt for the ent ir e human race is located on the same spot, thus givi ng every human b eing an entirely similar view of the w orl d. A findin g of tremendous value f or them , and for shamans of succeedin g generations, was that the lo cation of the ass emblage poi nt on that spot is the result of usage and social ization. For th is reason, they consid ered it to be an arbi t rar y position which gives merely the il lusion of bein g final and ir reducible. A pro duct of this illusion is the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"seemingly unshakable c onvic tion of human bein g s that the world they dea l with daily is the onl y wo rl d that ex ists, and that its fi nality is undeniable. \"Beli eve me,\" don Juan said to me once, \"th is sen se of finality about the world is a mere il lusion. Due to the fact that it has never been challenged, it stands as the only possible view. To see energy as it flo ws in the universe is t he tool for challenging it. Through the use of this tool, the sor cerer s of my lineage arrived at the conc lusion that there are ind eed a stag gering number of w orlds available to man's percep tion. They describ ed those worl ds as be ing all - inclusive realms, realms where one can act and strugg le. In other words, they are wor lds where one ca n live and die, as in th is world of everyday li fe.\" Duri ng the thir teen years of my a ss oci ation with him, don Juan taught me the basic steps toward accompl ishing this feat of seei ng. I have discussed those steps in all of my previo us writ ings, b ut nev er have I to uched on th e k ey poi nt in th is pr ocess: t he mag ical passes. He taught me a g reat number of them, bu t alon g with that wealth of k nowl edge, don J uan a lso left me with the ce rtain ty that I wa s the last link of his lineage. Acceptin g t hat I was the last li nk of his li neage impl ied automa tical ly for me the t ask of findi ng new ways to disseminate the knowledge of his li neage, since its conti nuity was no lo nger an issue. I need to clar ify a very impo rtant poi nt in this regard: Don Juan M atus was not ever inter este d in teaching his knowledge; he was inter este d in perp etuating his lineage. His three other disciples and I were the means - chosen, he said, by the spiri t itself, for he had no active part in it - that were going to en sure that perp etuati on. Therefore, he engage d himself in a titanic effort to teach me all he knew about sorcery, or s hamani sm, and ab out the development of his lineage. In the cou rse of t rai ning me, he realized that my energetic configuration was , acc ording to him , so vas tly dif fe rent from his own that it couldn't mean anything else but the end of his line. I told him that I resented enor mous ly his inter pretat io n of whateve r invi sible dif fe rence existed between us. I did n't like the burden of be ing the last of his line, nor did I understand his reasoning."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" \"The shamans of ancient Mexico,\" he said to me once, \"believed that choice, as human bein gs under stand it, is the preco ndition of the cogniti ve worl d of man, but that it is onl y a be nevolent interpretation of som ething wh ich is found when aw a reness ventures beyond the cushion of our world, a benevolen t interpretation of acquiescence. Human bein gs are in the t hroes of f orc es that pul l them e very which w ay. The art of sorcerers is not r eally to choose, but to be sub tle enough to a cqui esce. \"Sorc e rers, a ltho ugh they seem to make nothing else but decisions, make no decisions at all ,\" he we nt on. \"I didn't deci de to choose you, and I didn't deci de that y ou wo uld be the way you are. Sinc e I coul dn't choose to whom I wo uld impart my knowledge, I had to accept whomever the spirit was off ering me. And that person was you, and you are energeticall y capable only of ending, not of continuing.\" He maintai ned that the endi ng of his li ne had nothing to do with him or his effor ts, or with his success or fail ure as a sorcer er seek ing total freedo m. He under stood it as something that had to do with a choice exerci sed bey ond the human level, not by beings or entit ies, b ut by the im personal forces of the univ erse. Finally, I came to accept what don Jua n called m y fate. Acceptin g it put me face to face with another issue that he referred t o as locking the door w hen you leave . That is to say, I ass umed the responsibility of deciding exactly what to do with everything he had taught me and carrying out my decision impeccably. Fir st of all, I aske d mys elf the cru cial question of what to do with the magical passes : the facet of don Juan's knowledge most imbu ed with pragmatism and function. I decid ed to use the magical passes and teach the m to whoever wanted to learn them. My decisi on to end the secrecy that had surrounded them for an undet ermin ed length of t ime was, naturally, the cor ollary of my total convi ction that I am in deed the end of don Juan's li neage. It became inconcei vab le to me that I should carr y secrets which were not even mine. To shrou d the magical passes in secrecy was not my decisio n. It was m y decisi on, however, to end such a condit io n. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" I endeavored from the n on to come up w ith a m ore generic form of each magica l pass, a fo rm suitab le to everyone. This resulted in a con figur ation of sl ightly modified forms of each one of the magical passes .

When I confronted don Juan with the discr epa ncy between his estimate and what I consid ered to be a more realistic one, he remained adamant in his c onvic tion. He beli eved it to be a fact that people wh o li ved in the New World ten thousand years ago we re deeply conc e rned with matters of the univ erse and percep tion that modern man has not even b egun to fathom. Regardless of our differing chr ono lo gica l interpretation s, the effectiveness of the magical passes is unden iable to me, and I feel obligated to eluci date the subject strictly follo wing the man ner in wh ich it was presented to me.

He used to move his arms, legs, to rso, and hips in specifi c ways , I thought, in order to create a ma ximum stretch of his muscles, bones, and ligaments . The result of these stretching mov ements, fro m my point of view , was a success io n of cracki ng sounds which I always thought that he was pro duc ing for my amazement and amusement. He, ind eed , had aske d me time a nd t ime again to imi tate him. In a challenging man ner, he had even dared me to memo ri ze the movements and repeat them at h ome until I could get my joi nts to make crac king noises, just like his.

I know now that not achi eving that cracking sound was a blessing in disguise, because the m uscles and tendons of the a rms and back sho ul d never be stress ed to that poi nt. Don J uan was bo rn with a facili ty to crack the joints of his ar ms and back, just as some peop le have the f acility to c rack their knuckles. \"How did the old s orc e rers i nvent th ose magical pas ses, d on J uan?\" I ask ed. \"N obody invented them,\" he said sternly. \"To t hin k that they were invented implies instantly the inter vention of the m ind, and th is is not the case when it comes to those magical passes.

Soon, they fou nd out that not all the stat es of shamanistic he ightened awar eness which they entered produced in t hem the same sensation of well - bein g. A more carefu l scr utiny revealed to them that whenever t hat s ensati on of wel l - be ing occurred, t hey had always been engage d in s ome specifi c k ind of bodil y movement. They realize d that whil e they were in stat es of heigh tened awareness, their bodies moved involuntaril y in ce rtain ways , and that those certain ways were indeed the cause of that unu sual sensat io n of physical and mental plen itude.\" Don Juan speculated that it had always appeared to him that the movements th at the bod ies of th ose shamans executed automatical ly in heightened awareness were a sort of hidden heritage of mankind, something that had been put in deep storage, to be revealed onl y to those who were lo okin g for it. He por trayed those sorcer ers as deep - sea divers, who w itho ut knowing it, reclaimed it. Don Juan said that those sorcer ers arduously began to piece together some of the movements they remembered . Thei r e fforts paid off . They were capable of re - c reating movements that had seemed to them to b e automat ic reactions of the body in a state of heightened awareness. encou raged by their succ ess , they were capabl e of re - c reating hund reds of movements, which they perf ormed withou t ever attempting to classify them into an under standable scheme. Thei r id ea was that in heightened awareness, the movements happen ed spontaneously, a nd that there was a force that guided their effect, without the intervention of their volition. Don Jua n commented that the nature of the ir findin gs always led him to be li eve tha t the sorcer ers of ancient times were extraordinary peopl e , Becaus e the movements that they discovered were never rev ealed in the same fashio n to moder n shamans who also entered into heightened awareness. P erhaps this was because moder n shamans had learn ed the movements befor e hand, in so me fashio n or another, from their pred ecess ors, or perhaps because the sorcer ers of anci ent times had more energetic mass . "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" \"What do you mean, don Juan, that they had more energetic mass ?\" I asked. \"Wer e they bigger men?\" \"I don 't think they were physicall y any bigg e r, \" he said, \"but energetically, they appeared to the eye of a seer as an oblong shape. They call ed themselves lumi nous eggs. I hav e nev er se en a luminous egg in my life. All I have seen are luminou s balls. It is presumabl e, then, that man has lo st s ome ener getic mass over the generation s. \" Don Juan explain ed to me that to a seer, the uni verse is compo sed of an inf inite number of energy fields. They appear to the eye of the seer as lumi nous filaments that shoo t out every which way. Don Juan said that th ose fil aments cri ss cro ss throu gh the lumi nous balls that human bein gs are, and that it was reasonabl e to ass ume that if human be ings were once oblong shapes, like egg s, they were much higher than a ball. Ther efor e, ene rgy fiel ds that touched human be ings at the cro wn of the lumi nous egg are no lo nger touching them now that they are luminous ball s. Don Jua n felt that this meant to him a lo ss of e nergy mass , which seemed to have been c ruc ial f or the pu rpose of recla iming that hidden treasure: the magica l p a ss es. \"Why are the passes of the old shamans call ed magical passes , don Juan?\" I aske d him on one occasion. \"They are not just call ed magica l passes ,\" he said, \"they are magical! They pro duce an effect that can not be a ccounted for by means of ordinar y explanations. These movements are not physical exerc ises or mere postures of the body; they are real attempts at reach ing an optimal state of being. \"The magic of the movements,\" he went on, \" is a subtle change t hat the practition e rs experienc e on executing them. It is an ephemeral quality that the movement bri ngs to their phys ical and menta l st ates , a kind of sh ine, a light in the e yes . Thi s subtle change is a touch of the spiri t.

A li ve world, on the other hand, is in c onstant flu x. It moves. It change s. It reverses itself. \"The most abstract reason why the ma gical passes of the sorcer ers of ins lineage are magical, \" he went on, \"is that in practicing them, the body of the practition e r realizes that everything, i nstead of be ing an unbroken chain of objects that have affini ty f or each other, is a current, a flux. And if everything in the uni verse is a flux, a current, that cur rent . .i n he stopped.

Ther efor e, the energy existing within that conglomerate of energy fields is all that each human individual c a n count on."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" \"The natural tendency of human beings ,\" he sa id, \"is to push energy away from the centers of vitality, which are located on the ri ght side of the bod y, right at the edge of the rib cage on the a rea of the li ver and gallbladder; on the left si de of the bod y, again, at t he edge of the ri b cage, on the area of the pancreas and spleen; on the back, right behi nd the other two centers, aro und the k idneys , and right above t hem , on the area of the adrenal gla nds; at the base of the neck on the V spot made by the sternum and cla vicle; and around the uteru s and ovar ies in women. \" \"How do hu ma n beings push thi s energy away , don Juan?\" I ask ed. \" By worr ying,\" he replied. \"By succumbi ng to the stress of ever yday li fe.

Thei r expertise in dealing with it became so e xtraord inary that their actions were transfor med into legends, mythological events th at existed onl y as fabl es.

The wo rd Tensegrity is a most appropriat e defi niti on, because it is a mixture of two terms, tension and integ ri ty: terms which c onn ote the two dri v ing forces of the magical passes. The activity created by contr actin g and rel axing the tendons and muscles of the bod y is tension. Integ ri ty is the act of regarding the bod y as a sound, compl ete, perfect unit. Tensegrity is taught as a system of mov ements, because that is the onl y manner in which t he my sterious and vas t subject of the mag ical passes could be faced in a mode rn sett ing. The peopl e who now practice Tensegrity are not shaman practi tioners in search of shamanistic alternating invol ve ri gorous disci pline, exertion, and hardships. Ther efore, the emphasis of the magical passes has to be on their value as movements, and all the consequences that such moveme nts bring forth. Don Juan Matus had explained that the first driv e of the sorcer e rs of his lineage who li ved in Mexico in ancient times, in rel ation to the mag ical passes, was to saturate themselves w ith movement. They arr anged e very posture, ev ery move ment of the b ody that they coul d remember, into groups. They beli eved that the lo nger the group, the greater its effect of saturati on, and the greater the need fo r the practitioners to use their memory to recall it.

From then on , what was s ought wa s the opp osite: the fragmentation of the lo ng groups into single seg ment s, which were practiced as ind iv idu al, independent units. The manner in which don Juan Matus taught the magical passes to his fou r disciples - Taisha Abelar, F lorinda Donner - Grau, Carol Figgs , and mys elf - was the product of this drive for fragment ation. Don Juan's personal opinion was that the benefi t of practicing the lo ng groups was patently obvio us; such practi ce forced the shaman ini tiat es to use their kinesthetic memory.

In ord er to accomplish this arr angement, it was nece ss ary to reestablish the cri ter ia of saturation which had pro mpted the creation of the long group s.

The ol d sorcer ers didn't seem to have known this, but even if they did , they never conc eptualized it in th ose terms.

Don Juan explained that the clarity I was experi encin g was the r esult of the redep lo yment of my ener gy. The c oncer n of people p racticing Tenseg ri ty nowaday s matches exactly m y conc ern a nd the conc ern of don Juan's other disci ples whe n we fir st began to pe rform the magica l passes. They feel bewil dered by the number of movements. I rei terate to them what don Juan reiterated to me over and over: that what is of supreme impo rtance is to practi ce whateve r Tensegrity sequence is reme mbered. The saturation that has been carr ied on wi ll give, in the end, the results s ought by the shamans of anc ient Mexico : the redeployment of energy, and its three concomitants - the shutting off of the inter nal dialogue, the poss ibili ty for inn er silence, and the fluidity of the assem blage po int. As a personal ass ess ment, I can say that by saturating me with the magica l passes , don Juan accomplished two for midable feats: One, he bro ught to the surface a flo ck of hid den resources that I had but didn't know exi s ted, such as the ability to concentrate and the ability to remember detail; and two, he gently bro ke my obsess io n with my li near mode of interpretation. \"What is happen ing to you,\" don Juan explain e d to me when I ques tion ed him about what I was experien cin g in th is respect, \"is that you are feeli ng the advent of inner"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"silenc e, once your internal dialog ue has been minimally off set.

The execution of the magical pass es, as shown in Tensegrity, doesn't necessarily requi re a parti c ular space or prearrange d time. However, the movements shoul d be done away fro m sharp currents of air . Don Juan dreaded currents of air on a perspiri ng body. He fir m ly believed that not every current of air was caused by the ri sing or lo wer ing of temperature in the atmosphere, and that some c urr ents of air were actuall y caused by conglo merates of consolidate d ener gy fie lds mo vi ng pur pos efully through space. Don Juan was convi nced that such co nglomer ates of energy fiel ds possessed a specifi c type of awareness, particularly deleterious becaus e human be ings canno t ordinarily detect them, and become exposed to them indis cri minately.

The practice of Tens egrity shoul d not be m ixed with elements with which we are already thoroughly fami liar, such as conversation, mus ic, or the sou nd of a radio or TV newsman reportin g the news, no matter how muffled the sound migh t be. The sett ing of moder n urb an life facili tates the for mati on of group s , and under these cir cumstances, the only manner in which Tens egrity can he taught a nd practiced in the seminars and works hop s is in groups of practition e rs. Practici ng in group s is benefi c ial in many aspects and deleteri ous in others. It is benefi cial becaus e it all ows the creation of a c onsensus of mov ement and the opp ortunity to learn by examination and c omparison. It is deleteri ous because it fosters the rel ianc e on others, a nd the emergence of synta ctic command s and soli citations dealing with hierarchy. Don Juan conceived that since the totality of human behavior was ruled by language, human be ings have learn ed to respond to what he call ed synta ctic c ommands, praising or depr ecato ry for mulas bui lt into language - for example, the responses that each ind iv idu al makes , or elicits in others, with s loga ns such as No pr obl em , Piece of cake, I t's time to worr y, You could do better, I can't do it, My butt is too big, I'm the best, I'm the worst in the world, I could li ve with that, I'm coping , Everything's going to be okay, etc., etc. Don Juan maintai ned th at what sorcer ers have always wanted, as a ba sic rul e of thumb, is to run away from activities derived from syntact ic command s. Ori gi nall y , as don Juan described it , the magical p ass e s were perfor med by the s hamans of anci ent Mexico individ ually and in s olitari ness, on the spur of the moment or as the necessity arose.

However, the cond itions of modern life a nd the fact t hat t he goal of the m agical passes ha s been for mulated to ap ply to a great number of people make it imper ative that a new appr oach be taken. Tensegrity shoul d be practi ce d in whateve r form is easiest : ei ther i n g roups, or alone, o r both. In my particular case, the practice of Tensegrity in very lar ge groups has b een more than ideal, because it has given me the unique opportunity of witnessing something which don Juan Matus and all the sorcer e rs of his li neage never did : the effects of human mass . Don Juan and all the shamans of his lineage, which he considered to be twenty - seven generation s long, never were capable of witnessing the effects of human mass . They practi ced the magical passes alon e, or in groups of up to five practitioners. For them, the magical pass es were highl y individu ali stic. If the number of Te nsegrity practi tion ers is in the hund reds, an energetic current is nearl y instantaneously formed among them. This energetic cur rent, wh ich a shaman could easil y see, cr eates in the practitioners a sen se of urgency. It is like a vibratory w ind that swee ps t hro ugh them, and gives them the pri ma ry elements of purpose. I have been pri vi leged to see something I consid ered to be a por tentous sight: the awakening of purpose, the energetic basis of man. Do n Jua n Matus used to call this unbend ing intent. He taught m e that unben din g intent is the ess ential tool of those who jour neyed into the unknown. A very impo rtant issue to consid er when practi c ing Tensegrity is that the movements must be executed with the idea that the benefi t of the magical passes comes by itse lf. Thi s idea must be stressed at an y cost. At the be gi nning, it is very dif fic ult to discern the fact that Tensegrity is not a standa rd sys tem of movements for developing the body. It ind eed develops the body, but onl y as a by - product of a more t ranscende ntal effect. By redeployin g unused energy, the magical passes can conduce the practitioner t o a level of awareness in wh ich the parameters of norma l, tra ditional percep t io n are canceled out by the fact that they are expanded.

All the magica l passes of the six series can be repeated as many times as desired, unl ess otherwi se specifi ed. If they are fir st done with the left side of the bod y, they must be repeated an equal number of times with the ri ght side. A s a rul e, every m agical pass of the six seri es begins with the left side. 2. The feet are kept separate by a distance equiv alent to the shoulders' width. This is a balan ced way to distri bute the weight of the body. If the legs are spread too far apart, the balan ce of the bod y is impaired. The same thing happens if they are to o close together. The best way to arr ive at this distance is to begin fro m a positi on where the two feet are clo se together (fi g. 1). The tips of th e feet are then pivoted on the fixed heels and opene d in a letter V shape ( fig. 2). Shif ting the weight to the tips of the feet, the heels are pivoted out to the sides an equal di stance (fi g. 3). The tips of the feet are bro ught into parallel alignment, a nd the distance between the feet is rou ghly the width of the shoulders. Further adj ustment may be necessary here in ord e r to reach that desired width and to get the o ptimal balance of the body.  3. During the execution of all the magical passes of Tensegrity, the knees are k ept slightly bent, so that when one is looking down, t he kneecaps blo ck the view of the t ips of the feet (fi gs . 4, 5), except in the case of spec ifi c magical passes in wh ich the knees have to be lo cked.

The th umb must a lways be kept in a locked pos itio n, mean ing that it is folded over the edge of the hand. It should never stick out (fi g. 8) . The so rcer ers of don J uan's li neage consid e red the thumb to be a c ruc ial eleme nt in terms of energy and func tion.

Another important issue in the practice of Tensegrity is an act which has been termed turni ng the bod y on. This is a uni que act in which all the muscles of the bod y, and specificall y the diaphrag m, are contr a cted in one instant. The muscles of the stomach and abdomen are jolted, as are the m usc les around the s hou lders and should er blad es. The arms and leg s are ten sed in uni son with equal force, but onl y for an instant (fi gs . 15, 16) . As practi tion ers of Tensegrity pro gr e ss in their practi ce, they can learn to sust ain this tension for a while longer. Turnin g the bod y on has nothi ng to do with the state of perenn ial bodily tension that seems to be the mark of our times. When the bod y is tense with preoccupation or over work, and the m uscles of the neck are as ha rd as they can be, the bod y is not in a ny way turned on. Relaxin g the muscles or arr ivin g at a state of tranqu illi ty is not turning the bod y off, either. The idea of t he sorcerers of ancient Mexico was that with t heir magical passes , the bod y was alerted; it was made to be ready for action. Don Juan Matus termed this cond itio n turning the bod y on. He said that when the muscular tension of turning the body on ceases , the body is turned off naturally. 12. Breath an d breathing were, according to don Juan, of sup reme importance for the sorcer ers of anci ent Mexico. They divi ded breath into breathi ng with the tops of the lun gs , breathi ng w ith the m idsectio n o f the lungs, and breathing with the abdomen (f igs. 17, 18, 19) .

Another important issue concerning the breathing in Tensegrity is that breathing is nor mal wh il e executing the Tensegrity moveme nts, unl ess otherwi se specifi ed in the descrip tion of any given magical pass. 13. Another consideration in performing the Te nsegrity movements is the reali zation that has to come to practi tioners that Tensegrity is in ess ence the inter play between rel axing and tensing the muscles of choi ce parts of the bod y in order to arrive at a most coveted physical explosion, which the sorc e rers of ancient Mexico knew only as the energy of the tendons.

"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" THE FIRST SERI ES The Series for Pr epa ri ng Intent Don Juan Matus stated that human bein gs as organi sms perf orm a stupendous maneuver of percep tion which, unfortunatel y, c reates a misconc eption , a false fro nt; they take the influx of sheer ener gy i n the universe at lar ge and turn it into sensory data, which t hey interpret acc ording to a s tric t sys tem of interpretation that sorcerers call t he human for m. This magical act of inter preti ng pur e energy gives ri se to the misconc eption, the pecu li ar conviction of human bein gs t hat t heir i nterpretation sy stem is all that exists. Don Juan elucidated this phenomenon with an example. He said that tree, as tree is known to human bein gs , is more interpretation t han percep tion. He pointed out that for human bein gs to esta bli sh the presence of tree, all they need is a cur sory glance that tells them hard ly a nything. The rest is a pheno m enon which he described as the callin g of intent, the intent of tree; that is to say , the int erpr etation of sensory data pertain ing to the specifi c phenomenon that human be ings call tree. He declared that the entire worl d of hu ma n bein gs , just as in this e xample, is compo sed of an endl ess reper toir e of inter pretations where human sense s play a minimal rol e. In other words, onl y the visual sense touches the energy inf lux which comes from the uni verse at lar ge, and it does so onl y in a cursory fas hion.

The example that don J uan li ked the best was the way in which he said we const ruc t, by intending, something as overwhelmi ng and as cru cial as the Whi te House. He call ed the Whi te House the site of power of today's worl d, the center of all our endeavors, hop es, fears, and so on, as a"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"global conglomerate of human beings - for all practi ca l purposes, the capi tal of the civilized world. He said that a ll th is wasn't in the realm of the abstract, or even in the realm of our min ds, but in the rea lm of intending, because from the poi nt of v iew o f ou r sensory inp ut, the White H ouse was a building that in no way had the richness, the scope, the depth of the conc ept of the White House. He added that fr om the poi nt of view of the inp ut of sensory data, the Whi te Ho use, li ke everything else in our worl d, was cur sori ly apprehended with our visual sense s onl y; our tactile, olfactory, auditory, and tast e senses were not engaged in any way. The inter pretatio n that those senses could make of sensory data in rel ation to the bui lding where the White House is would have no meaning whats oever. The question that don Juan aske d as a sorcer er was where the Whi te House was. He said, answering his own question, t hat i t was cert ainl y not in our pe rception, n ot ev en in our thoughts, but in a special realm of intending, where it was nur tured with everything perti nent t o it. Do n Jua n's ass ertio n was that to create a total universe of intending in such a man ner was ou r magi c. Sinc e the theme of the first series of Tensegrity is preparing the practitioners for intend ing, it's impo rtant to review the sorcer ers' defi nition of intend ing. For don Juan, intend ing was the tacit act of fil ling out the empty spaces left by dir ect s ensory percep tion, or the act of enriching the observable pheno mena by means of intending a compl eteness that do esn't exist fr om the point of view of pure perception. The act of intending this completeness was refer red to by don Juan as callin g intent. E verything he explained about intent pointed to t he fact that the act of intending is not in the realm of the physical. In other words, it is not part of the physicality of the brain or any other organ. Intent, for don Juan, tra nscended the world we know. I t is something l ike an energetic wave, a beam of energ y which attaches itself to us. Because of the extrinsic nature of intent, don Juan made a distinc tion between the bod y as part of the cogniti on of everyday li fe and the bod y as an energetic uni t which was not part of that c ogniti on. This energetic unit included the unseen parts of the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"bod y, such as the inter nal organs , and the energy that flo wed throu gh them. Don Juan ass erted that i t was with this par t that ene rgy could b e directly perceived. He poi nted out that because of the predom inance of sight in our habitual way of percei ving the worl d, the shamans of anci ent Mexico describ ed the act of dir ectly appr ehending energy as seeing. For them t o perceive energy as it flowed in the universe meant that e nergy adopted non - idiosyncrati c , specifi c c onfigurations that repeated themselves consistently, and that those conf igurations coul d be perceived in the same terms by anyone who saw. The most important ex ample don Jua n Mat us coul d g ive of t his co nsistency of energy in adopti ng spec ifi c configurations was the pe rception of the human bod y whe n it was seen dir ectly as energy. As it was alr eady said, shamans li ke don Juan percei ve a human bein g as a c onglo me rate of energy fields that gi ves the total impress io n of a clear - cut sphere of luminosi ty. Taken in this sense , energy is describ ed by shamans as a vibration that agg luti nates itself into c ohesive units. Shamans describ e the entire universe as bein g composed of energy configurations that appear to the seeing eye as fil aments, or lumi nous fibers t hat a re st run g in every which w a y withou t ever be ing entangled. This is an inc omprehensible proposition for the linear m ind . It has a bui lt - in contradiction that can't be resolved: How coul d those fib ers extend themse lve s e very which way and yet not b e entangled? Don Juan emphasized the poi nt that shamans wer e able onl y to describ e events , and that if their terms of descrip tion seemed inad equate and contr adic t ory, it was because of the limitations of sy ntax. Yet thei r d escr ipti ons w ere as strict as anythi ng could be. The shamans of a nci ent Mexic o, according to don Juan, described intent as a pe renn ial for ce that permeates the entir e universe - a force that is aware of itself to the point of respond ing to the beckoni ng or to the c ommand of shamans. By means of intent, those shamans were capabl e of unleashi ng not only a ll the human possibili t ies of percei vi ng, but all the human pos sibiliti es of action.

He stat ed that each of the steps is a magical pass which has a built - in c ontrol for the mashing of e nergy, and that practitioners ca n repeat these magical passes hundreds of times, if they so de sire, withou t worr yi ng about an excessive stir ri ng of energy. In don Juan's view, energy for intending that was stirred up exces sively ended up further depl eting the centers of vitality. 1.

"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" THE S ECOND S ERIES The Series for the Womb Accordin g to don Juan Matus, one of the most specifi c interest s of the shamans who li ved in Mexico in ancient times was what the y call ed the liberation of th e womb. He explain ed that the liberation of the womb ent ail ed the awakeni ng of its secondar y func tions, and that since the primary func tion of the womb, under normal cir cumstances, w as repr oduction, th ose sorcer ers were s ol ely concerned w ith what they cons ider e d to be its secondary function: evo luti on. Evol ut io n, in the case of the w omb, was, for them, the awakening and full exploitati on of the womb's capacity to process dir ect know ledge - that is to say , the possibili t y of appr e hending sensory data and int erpr et ing it dir ectly, without the aid of the processe s of inter pretatio n with wh ich we are f amiliar. For shamans, the moment in which practitioners are transfor med fro m bein gs that are social ized to reproduce into bein gs capable of evolving is the mome n t when they become conscious of seeing energy as n flow s in the universe. In the opinion of shamans, females can se e e ne rgy dir ect ly more re adil y than males becaus e of the effect of their wombs. It is also their opinion that under normal conditions, regard less of the faci lity that women have, it is nearl y impo ss ible for women or for men to become deli be rately conscious that they can se e e nergy dir ectly. The reason f or th is incapacity is something whi ch shamans con sider to travesty : the fact that there is no one to point out to hu man beings that it is natural for them to see energy direc tly. Shamans maintai n that women, because they have a womb, are so versatile, so ind iv idu alistic in their ability to see energy dir e ctly that this accomplishment, wh ich shou ld be a triump h of the human spirit, is taken for granted. Wo men a re never consci ous of the ir ability. In this respect, males are more proficient. Sinc e it is m ore dif ficu lt for them to see energy directly, when th ey do accomplish th is feat, they don't"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"tak e it for granted. Ther efor e male sorcer ers were the ones who set up the parameters of perceiving energy di rectly and the ones who tried to describe the phenomenon. \"The basic premise of sorcery,\" don Juan sai d to me one day, \"disco vered by the shamans of my li neage who li ved in Mexico in anci ent times is that we are percei vers. The totality of the human bod y is an instr ument of percep tion . However, the pred ominance of the visual in us gives to percep t io n the overall mood of the eyes . Thi s mood , according to the ol d sorcerers, is merely the heritage of a pur e ly pred at ori a l stat e . \"The effort of the ol d sorcer e rs, which has lasted to our days,\" don Juan continued, \"was geared toward placing themselves beyond the realm of the predator's eye. They conc eived the pred ator's eye to be v isual par excellenc e, and that the realm beyond the pred ator's eye is the realm of pure perception, which is not visually oriented.\" On another occasion, he said that it was a bone of contention for the sorcerers of anci ent Mexi co that women, who have the organi c frame, the womb, that could faci litate their ent rance into the realm of pure pe rcepti on, have no interest in using it. Tho se shamans viewed it as a woman's parad ox to have endl ess power at her disposal and no interest wh atsoev er in gaining access to it. However, don Juan had no doubt that this l ack of desire to do anything was n't natur al; it was lear ned. The aim of the magica l passes for the womb is to give the female practi tioners of Tensegrity an inkl ing, which has to be more than an intellectual titillation, of the possibi lity of canceling out the effect of th is noxious socialization that renders women ind ifferent. Neverthe less, a warning is in ord e r; don Juan Matus advised his fema le disci ples to proceed with great c aut io n when practi c ing these magical passes . The magical passes for the womb are passes that foster the awakening of the secondar y func tions of the uterus and ovaries, and t hose secondar y func t io ns a re the appr ehension of sensory data and the interpretatio n of them. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" Don Juan called the wom b the pe rcei ving box. . He was as convi nced as the other sorcer ers of his lineage that the uterus and ovari es, if they are pulled out of the repr oductive cycle, can become tools of percep tion, and become indeed the epicen ter of evolution. He considered that the first step of evolution is the acceptance of the premi se that human be ings are perceivers. It was not redu ndancy on his part to insist ceaseless ly that thi s has to be d one before anything else. \"We already know t h at we are perceivers. What else can we be?\" I would s ay in protest every time he i nsisted. \"Think about it!\" he woul d rep ly ev ery t ime I prot este d. \" Perceptio n plays onl y a minute rol e in our lives , and yet, the onl y th ing we are for a fact is pe rcei vers . Human bein gs appr ehend energy at lar ge and turn it into sen sory data. Then they interpret these sensory data into the world of everyday life. Thi s interpretation is what we call percep tion. \"The shamans of anci e nt Mexico, as you alr ea dy know,\" don Juan went on, \"were convi nced that interpretation t ook p lace on a poi nt of intense brillian ce , the ass emblage poi nt , which they found when they saw the hum an bod y as a conglo merate of energy fiel ds that resembled a sphere of luminosi ty. The advantage of women is their capacity to transfer the inter pretat io n func t io n of the ass emblage point to the womb. The resu lt of this transfer function is something that canno t be talked about, not because it is something fo rbidden, but because it is something indescribabl e. \"The womb,\" don Juan continued, \"is veritabl y in a chaoti c stat e of turmoi l, because of this veiled capaci ty that exists in remiss io n from the moment of birth until death but which is never utilized. Thi s func tion \"I inter pretat io n never ceases to act an d yet it ha s never been raised to the level of full consciousness. \" Don Juan's ass uran ce was that the shamans of anci ent Mexico, by means of their magical passes , had rai sed among their female pr actitio ners the interpretive capaci ty of the womb to the le vel of consci ousness, and by doi ng this, they had instituted an"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"evoluti onary change among them; that is to say , they had turned the womb fro m an organ of reproduction into the tool of evolution.

The evolutionary theory that has la sted to our day, fro m the time it was for mulated over a hundred years ago, say s that the ori gin and the perp etuation of a new species of animal or plant is bro ught about by the pro cess of natural selection, which favors the survival of individuals whose ch aracteristics render them best adapted to their enviro nment , and that the evolution is brought about by the interplay of th ree pri ncip les: first, heredity, the c onservative for ce that transmits simil a r organi c forms fro m one generation to another; second, var iation, the differenc es present in a ll forms of life; and th ird, the strugg le for existence, which determines which var iations conf e r advantage s in a given enviro nment.

It is at best an open - ended pro cess for wh ich scientists have created classifi catory schemes; they have created taxonomies to their hearts' content. But the fact remain s that it is a theory full of holes. What we kn ow about evolution doesn't tel l us what evoluti on is. Don Juan Matus believed that evolution was the product of intending at a very pro fou nd level. In the case of sorcer ers, that pro found level was marked by what he had called inner silence. \"For instance,\" he said, when he was explaining this pheno men on, \"so rcer ers are sure that dinosaurs flew because they intend ed flying. But what is very difficu lt to under stand, m uch less accept, is that wings are only one solution to flying, in this case, the din osaurs' solution. Nevertheless, this soluti on is not the onl y one that is possibl e. It's the onl y one availabl e to us by imi tation.

He insisted that because intent is infinite, there was no logica l way in which the mind, following pro cess es of deduction or induction, could ca lculate or determine what these opti ons for flying might be. The magical p ass e s of the Series for the Wo mb are extremely potent, and sho uld be practiced sparingly. In a nci ent times, men were barred from executing them. In more recent t imes, there has been a tendency am ong sorcer e rs to rend er thes e m agical passe s more generic, a n d th us the poss ibi lity arose that they coul d also be of service to men. This possibility, however, is very delicate and requires careful handlin g, great concentration, and determination. The male p ractitioner s of Tensegrity who teach the m agical passe s h ave opted, because of their potent effect, to practice them by brushing the energy that they generate only li ghtly on the area of the genitals themselves. Thi s measure has pro ven to he enough to pro vide a beneficial jolt without any profound or deleteri ous effects. Don Juan explain e d that the sorcer ers of his li nea ge, at a g iven moment, all owed males to practi ce these magical passes because of the possibi lity that the energ y engendered by them woul d awaken the secondar y func tion of the male sexual organs. He said that those sorcer ers consid e red that the secondar y function of the male sex ual organs is not at all similar t o that of the w omb; no inter pretat io n of sensory data can take place because t he male sexual or gans hang outside of th e cav ity of the body . Becaus e of these parti cular circumstances, their c onclusio n was th at the secondar y func tion of the male organs is something which they termed e voluti onary suppor t: a sort of sprin gb oard that catapults men to perfor m e xtrao rdinar y feats of what sorcer ers of ancient Mexico called unben ding intent, or clearheaded purpose and concentration.

This s eri es was conc eived as an attempt to integrate what don Juan Matus call ed the five conc erns of the shamans of anci ent Mexico. Everything thos e sorcer ers did rotated around five c oncer ns: one, the magical passes ; two, the energetic center in the human bod y called the center for decisi ons; three, recapitulation, the means for enhanci ng the scope of human awareness; tour, dreaming, the bona fide art of breaking the parameters of nor m al percep t io n; five, inner si lence, the stag e of human percep tion from wh ich th ose sorcer ers laun c hed every one of their percep tu al attainments. Thi s sequence of five conc erns wa s an arrang ement patterned on T he u nder standing t hat t hose s orc erers had of th e world around them. One of the astoun din g findings of those shaman s, accordin g to what don Jua n taught, was the existence in the universe of an agg lutinating force that binds e nergy fields together into concrete, functi onal units. The sorcerers who disc overed the existence of this for ce describ e d it as a vibrati on, or a vibratory cond ition, that permeates group s of energy fiel ds and glues them together.

"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The First Grou p: The Center for Decisions The most impo rtant top ic for t he s hamans w ho lived in Mexico in ancient times, and for all the shamans of don Juan's lineage, was th e center for decisions.

It is a center where energy is rar ef ie d to the point of be ing tremendously subtle, a nd it stores a specifi c type of energy which shamans are incapable of de fining. They are utterly certain , however, that they can feel the p resence of that ene rgy, and its effects .

They let those gigantic institutions decide for them , and they merely ful fill the decisions already made on their behalf. Th e V spot at the base of the neck was, for those shamans, a plac e of such impo rtance that they rar ely touched it with their hands; if it was touched , the touch was ri tualistic and always perf ormed by someone else with t he aid of an object. They used highl y polished pieces of hardwood or pol ished bones of animals, utilizin g the round head of the bon e so as to have an object of the perfect c ontou r, the size of the hollow spot on the neck.

The Second Gr oup: T he Recapi tu lation The recapitulation, according to what don Jua n taught his disciples, was a technique discovered by the sorcerers of ancient Mexic o, a nd used by ever y shaman practitioner fro m then on, to view and rel ive all the experiences of their li ves , in order to achieve two transcendental goa ls: one, the a bstract goal of fulfilling a uni versal code that demands that awareness mu st be rel inq uished at the moment of death; and two, the extremely pragmatic goal of acquiring perceptual flu idity."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" He said that the for mulati on of their first goal was the result of observation s that those sorcer ers made by means of the ir capaci ty to see energy dir ectly as it flo ws in the uni verse. They had seen that there exists in the uni verse a gigantic for ce, an immense conglo merate of e nergy fiel ds which t hey call ed t he Eagle, or the dark sea of awareness . They observed that the dark sea of awareness is the for ce that lend s awareness t o all li ving bein gs , fro m viruses to m en. They beli eved that it lend s awareness to a newbor n bein g, and that this being enhances that awarene ss by means of its life experiences until a moment i n which the force demands its return. In the under stand ing of th ose sorcer ers, a ll li vi ng bein gs die because they are forced to return t he aw areness lent to them. Sorc erers throug hou t the a ges have understood that there is no way for w hat mo dern ma n cal ls ou r lin ear mode o f thi nking to explain s uch a pheno menon, bec ause there is no roo m for a cause - and - effect line of reasoning as to why and how awareness is lent a nd then taken back. The sorcer e rs of a nci ent Mexic o viewed it as an energetic fact of the universe, a fact that can't be explain ed in terms of cause and eff ect, o r in ter ms of a purp ose which c an be determined a priori. The so rcer ers of don Juan's li neage be li eved that to recap itul ate meant to g ive t he da rk sea of awareness what it was seek ing: their life experienc es. They be li eved that by means of the reca pitul ation, howev er, they coul d acquire a degree of contr ol that could permi t them to separate their li fe experiences from their life force. For them, the two were no t inext ri cably intertwined; they were j oi ne d o nly circumstantially. Tho se sorcer e rs affi rmed that the dark sea of awareness doesn't want to take the li ves of human bein gs ; it wants onl y their life experien ces. Lack of disci pline in human be ings prevents them fro m separating the two forces, and in the e nd, they lose their lives , when it is mea nt that they lo se only the force of their life exper iences. Tho se sorcer e rs viewed the recapitulation as the proce dur e by which they c ould give the dark sea of awareness a substitute for their li ves . They gave up their life experienc es by reco unting them, but they r etai ned their li fe force. The percep tua l claims of sorcer e rs, when examined in terms of the linear concepts of our Western world, make no sense w hatsoever. Western civilization has been in contact"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"with the shamans of the New Wo rld for five hund red years, and there has never been a genuine attempt on the part of scholars to form ulate a serious philo sop hic a l discourse based on stat ements made by those shamans. For instance, the recapi tu lation may seem to any member of the Western world t o be congr uou s with psychoanal ysis, something in the li ne of a psycholo gical proce dur e, a sort of self - help technique. Nothi ng could be further from the truth. Accordin g to don Juan Matus, man always lo ses by defaul t. In the ca se of the premi ses of sorcery, he bel ieved that Western man is miss ing a tremendous opportunity for the enhancement of his awareness, and that the way in which Western man rel ates himself to the u niverse , lif e, and awarenes s is onl y one of a multi plicity of options. To recapitulate, for sha man practi tioners, means to give to an inc ompr ehensible for ce - the dark sea of awareness - the very thing it seems to be lo okin g for : their li fe experienc es, that is to say , the awareness that they have enhanced th rou gh those very li fe exper iences. Sinc e don Juan could not possibly explain these phenomena to me in terms of standard lo gic, he said that a ll that sorcer ers could aspire to do was to accomplish the feat of training t heir li fe f orc e w ithout knowin g how it w as don e. He also said that there we re t hou sands of sorcer e rs who had ac hieved th is. They had retained their life force after they had given the dark sea of awareness the for ce of their li fe experienc es. This me ant t o don J uan that those sorcer e rs didn't die in the usual sens e in which we under s tand death , but that they transcended it by retaining their li fe force and vanishin g from the face of the earth, e mbarked on a defin itive journey of percep tion. The be li ef of t he s hamans o f d on Jua n's lineage was that when death takes place in th is fashi on, all of our being is turned into energy, a special kind of energy that retains the mark of our individuality. Don Juan tried to explain th is in a metaphorical sense , say ing that we are compo sed of a number of single nations: the nation of the lun gs , the nation of the heart, the nation of the stomach , the nation of the k idn eys , and so on. Each of these nation s sometimes works ind ependentl y of the others, but at the moment of death, all of them are uni fied into one single entity. The sorcer ers of don Juan' s li neage call ed th is stat e total freedo m. F or th ose sorcerers, death is a unifier, a nd not an anni hilator, as it is for the average man."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" \"Is this st ate immor tality, don J uan?\" I ask ed. \"Thi s is in no way immor tality ,\" he replied. \"It is merely the ent rance into an evoluti onary process, using the only mediu m for evoluti on that man has at his dispo sal : awareness. The sorcer ers of my li neage were c onvin ced that man coul d not evolve biolo gica ll y any further; therefore, they conside red man's awareness to be the onl y mediu m for evolution. At the moment of dying, sorcer e rs are not annihilated by death, but are transformed into inorganic beings : beings that have awareness, but not an organi sm. To be transfor med into an inorganic bein g was e voluti on for them, an d it meant that a new , indescribable ty pe of aw areness was lent to them, an awareness that woul d last for veritably millions of years, but w hic h would also someday have to be return ed to the giver: the dark sea of awareness. \" One of the m ost important fi ndings of the sham ans of don Juan's li neage was that, li ke everything else in the uni verse, our wo rl d is a combination of two opposing, and at the same time compl ementary, forces. One of thos e for ces is the worl d we know, which those sorcer ers call ed the w orl d of organic beings . The other for ce is something they call ed the world of inorganic beings. \"The wo rl d of inorganic bein gs ,\" don Jua n said, \"is populated by bein gs that posses s awareness, but not an organi sm. They are conglomerates of energy fiel ds, just li ke we are. To the eye of a seer, instead of being luminous, as human be ings are, they are rather opaque. They are not round, but lo ng, ca ndl elike energetic configurations. They are, in essence, conglomerates of energy fields which have cohesion and boun dari es just li ke we do. They are held toget her by the s a me a gglu tinatin g force t hat holds our energy fiel ds together.\" \"Wher e is thi s inorganic w orld, don Juan? \" I asked. \"It is our twin wo rl d,\" he replied. \"It occupies t he same time and space as o ur wo rl d, but the type of awareness of ou r world is so d iff e rent fro m t he ty pe of aw areness of the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"inorganic w orld that we never notice the presenc e of inorganic bein gs , although they do noti ce ours.\" \"Are tho se ino rganic beings human beings that h ave ev ol ved?\" I asked. \"Not at all!\" he excla imed. \"The inorganic be ings of our twin world have been intr insically ino rganic fro m the start, the same way that we ha ve always been intr insically organic be ings, also fro m the start. They are be ings whose consciou sness can evolve just li ke our s, and it dou bt lessly does, but I have no fir sthand knowledge of how this happen s. What I do know, however, is that a human bein g whose awareness has evolved i s a bright, luminescent, round inorganic being of a special kind.\" Don Juan gav e me a series of descriptions of th is evoluti onar y process, which I always took to be poetic metaphor s. I s ingled out the o ne t hat pleased me the m ost, which was total freedom. I fancied a human be ing that ent ers into total freedo m to be the m ost cour ageous, the most imaginati ve being possibl e. Don Juan said that I was not fancyin g anything at all - that to enter into total freedo m, a human bein g must call on his or he r subli me side, wh ich , he said, human be ings have, but which it never occurs to them to use. Don Juan described the second, the pragmatic goal of the recapi tu lation as the acqui sition of fluidity. The sorcer ers' ratio nale behi nd this had to do with one of the most elusive s ubjects of sorcery: the as semblage poi nt , a point o f int ense luminosity the size of a tennis ba ll , perceivable when sorcerers see a human being as a conglomerate of energy fiel ds. Sorc e rers like d on Juan see that tril lions o f energ y fiel ds in the fo rm of f illi ments of li ght fro m the universe at lar ge converge on the ass emblage poi nt a nd go through it. This conf luence of filaments gives the assemblage poi nt its bri lliancy. The ass emblage poi nt makes it pos sible for a human be ing to percei ve those tril lions of energy fil aments by turni ng them into sensori al data . "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" The assemblage point then inter prets this d ata as the world of everyday life, that is to say, in ter ms of human socia li zation and human potential. To recapitulate is to rel ive every, or nearly every, experience that we have had, and in doi ng so to displ ace the ass emblage poi nt, ever so slightly or a great deal, pro pe lling it by the for ce of memory to adopt the positi on that it had when the event bein g recapi tu lated took plac e. Thi s act of going back and for th from previous positi ons to the cur rent o ne gives the shaman practi tion ers the necessary flu idity to withstand extraordi nary odd s in their journeys into infinity. To the Tensegrity practi tioners, the recapi tu latio n gives the necessary flu idi ty to wit hstand odd s which are not in a ny way part o f th eir habitual cognition. The recapi tu lation as a for mal pro cedure was don e in anci ent times by reco ll ecting every person the p ractiti oners knew and eve ry ex peri ence in wh ich t hey had take n pa rt. Don Juan sugg este d that in my case, which is the case of mod ern man , I make a written li st of all t he persons that I had met in my li fe, as a mnemonic device. Once I had written that li st, he pro ceede d to tell me how to use it. I had to take the fir st person on the li st, which went back wards in time from the prese n t to the time of my very first life experienc e, and set up, in my memo ry, my last interaction with that first person on my li st. Th is act is called arranging the event to be recapitul ated. A detail ed reco llection of m inu t iae is required as the pro per mea ns to hone one's capaci ty to remember. This recollection entails gett ing all the pertinent physical details, such as the surro undings where the event bein g reco ll ected took plac e. Once the event is arr anged, one should enter into the locale itself, as if a ctua ll y going into it, paying special attention to a ny rel evant phy sical configurations. If, for instance, the interaction took plac e in an off ice, what should be remembered is the floor, the doors, t he walls, the pic tures, the windo ws, the desks, the obje ct s on the de sks , e verything that coul d have been o bserved in a glance and then forgotten.

In this fashio n, the primacy of the experienc e takes pr ecedence. Somethin g that has just happened is somethin g that one can remember with great accur acy. Sorcerers a lways coun t on the fact tha t human be ings are ca pabl e of storin g detail ed information that they are not aware of, a nd that that detail is what the dark sea of awareness is after. The actua l recapi tu latio n of the event requires that one breathe deeply, fanning the head, so to speak, very sl owly and gently from sid e to sid e , b eginning on one side, left or ri ght, whichever. Thi s fanning of the head w as don e as many times as needed, whil e rememberi ng a ll the detail s accessib le. Don Jua n said that sorcerers talked about th is act as breathi ng in all of one's own feelings spent in the event bein g recoll ected, a nd expelli ng a ll the unwanted m ood s and ex tra neous feelings that were l eft with us. Sorc e rers believe that the mys tery of the recapitulati on li es in the act of inhaling and exhalin g. Sinc e breathing is a life - sust aining function, sorcerers are certain that by means of it, one can a lso de li ver to th e dark sea of awareness the facsimile of one's life experienc es. When I press ed don Juan for a ratio nal explanatio n o f this idea, his position was that things li ke the recapitulation c ould onl y be ex peri enced, not exp lai ned. He said that in the act of doi n g, one can fin d liberation, and that to e xplai n it was to dissipate our energy in fru itless effor ts. His invi tation was congru ous with everything rel ated to his kno wledge: the invitation to take action. The list of names is used in the recapi tu lation as a mnemoni c device that propels memory into an inconceivable journey. Sorc erers' positi on in this respect is that rememberi ng events that have just taken plac e prep ares the ground for remembering events more distant in time with the same clar ity and immedia cy. To reco llect experienc es in this way is to relive them, and to draw from th is recoll ect io n an extraordi nary impetus that is capabl e of stirring energy disper sed fro m our centers of vitality, and returning it to t hem.

To hear a sev ent y - five - year - old man or woman say that they are still in search of a perf ect companion is an affi rmation of something idealistic, roman tic, beautiful. However, to examine this obs ess io n in the context of the endl ess repetiti ons of a lifetime makes it app ea r as i t really is: something grotesque. Don Juan ass ured me that if any behavior al chang e is going to be accompl ished, it has to be done th rou gh the recapitulation, since it is the only vehicle that can enhance awareness by li bera ting one from the unvoi ced demands of social ization, which are so automatic, so taken for granted , that they are not even noticed under norma l conditio ns, much less examined.

The result of such an entrance was, for sorcer ers, the percep tion of veritable worlds where they could li ve or die, wo rl ds wh ich were astoundi ngly d iff e rent from ours, and yet utterly s imi lar. Pressed for a linear exp lanati on of this c ontradiction, don Juan Matus rei terated the standard positi on of sorcerers: that the answer s to all those questions were in the practi ce, not in the intel lectual inqui ry. He said that in order to ta lk about such possibi lities, we would have to use the synta x of language, whateve r language we spoke, and that synta x, by the for ce of usage, limits the possibi li ties of expression. The synta x of any language refers onl y to p erceptual poss ibi lities fou nd in the w orl d i n which we li ve. Don Juan made a sign ificant differenti at io n, in Spa nish, between two verbs: one was to dream, sonar; and the other was ensueno, wh ich is to dream the way sorcer ers dream. In Engli sh , there is n o c lear distinc tion between these two stat es: the nor mal dreaming, sueno, and the more complex stat e that sorcer ers cal l ensueno. The art of dreaming, according to what don Juan taught, ori ginated in a very casual observation t hat t he s hamans of ancient Mexico made w hen they saw peopl e w ho were asleep. They noti ced that during sleep the ass emblage point was displ aced in a very natural, easy way fro m its habi tual positi on, and that it moved an ywhere alon g the peri phery of the luminous sphere, or to any pla c e in the inter ior of it. Corr elat ing their seeing with the reports of the pe opl e who had been observed sleep ing, they realized"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"that the greater the observed displ acement of the ass emblage poi nt, the more astoundi ng the reports of events and scenes experie nced in dreams. After this observation to ok hold of them , thos e sorcer ers began to look avidly for opp ortunities to displ ace their own ass emblage poi nts. They ended up using psychotrop ic plants to accomplish t his. Very quickly, they realized that the dis placement bro ught about by using these plan ts was errati c, for ced, and out of control. In the midst of this failur e , nonetheless they discovered one thing of great value. They call ed it dreami ng attention. Don Juan explained this pheno men on, refer ring fi rst to the dail y awareness of human bein gs as t he at tention plac ed on t he e lements of the w orl d of everyday li fe. He po inted out that human bein gs took only a cursory and yet sust ained lo ok at everything that surro unded them. More than examining things , human beings simply esta bli shed the pres ence of those elements by a special type of a ttention, a specifi c aspect of their general awareness. His contenti on was that the same type of cur sory and yet sustained \"lo ok,\" so to speak, could be applied to the ele ments of an ordinary dream. He call e d this other, specific aspect of general awareness dreaming attention or the capacity that practi tioners acquire to maintain their awareness unwaveri ngly fi xed on the items of their dreams. The cultivation of dreaming attention gav e the so rcer e rs of don Jua n's li neage a basic taxonomy of dreams. They fou nd out that most of their dreams were imagery, pro ducts of the cognition of their daily world; however, there were some which escaped that classifi cation. Such dreams we re veritable stat es of he ightened awareness in which the elements of the dream were not mere imagery, but energy - generating affai rs. Dreams which had ene rgy - generating elements were, for those shamans, dreams in wh ich they were capab le of seeing energy as it (l owed in the uni verse. Tho se shamans were able to focus their dreami ng attention on any element of their dreams, and fou nd out, in this fashio n, that there are two kinds of dreams. One is the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"dreams that we are all familiar w ith, in wh ich phantasmago ri cal e lements come into play, something wh ich we could categorize as the pro duct of our mentality, our psyche; perh aps something that has to do with our neur ological makeup. The other kind of dreams they call ed energy - generating dreams . Don Juan said that those sorcer ers of anci ent t imes found themse lves in dreams whi ch were not dreams, but actual visitations made i n a dreamlike state to b ona f ide places o th er than this world - real places, just like the worl d in which we li ve; places where the objects of the dream generated energy, just as li ves , or animals, or even roc ks generate energy in our daily wo rl d, for a seeing sorcer er. Their visions of such plac es were, however, for those shamans, too fleetin g, too temporar y, to be of any value to them. They a ttribu ted th is flaw to the fact that their ass emblage poi nts could not be he ld fixed for any consid erable time at the position to which they had been displaced. Their attempts to remedy the situation resulted in the other high art of so rcer y: the art of st alkin g. Don Juan defined the two arts very clearly one day when he said to me that the art of dreami ng c onsisted of purposely displac ing the ass emblage poi nt from its habitual positi on. The art of stalking consisted in voli tionally making it stay fixed o n the ne w positi on to which it had been displaced. Thi s fixation a ll owed the shamans of ancient Me xico the opportunity to w itness other worl ds in the ir full extent. Don Juan said that so me of those so rcer ers never return e d fro m their journeys. In other w ord s, they opted for stay ing there, wherever \"there\" might have been. \"When the old sorcer e rs finished map pin g human bein gs as luminou s spheres,\" don Juan said to me once, \"they had discovered no les s than six hund red spots in the total lumi nous sphere t hat were the sites of bon a fid e worl ds. Meaning that, if the ass emblage poi nt became attached to any of those plac es, the result was the entrance of the practitioner into a total new world.\" "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" \"But wher e a re tho se six hundre d o the r wo rlds, d on Juan?\" I ask ed. \"The only answer to that question is inc ompr e hensibl e ,\" he said, laughi ng. \"It's the ess ence of sorcer y, and yet it means nothing to the average mind . Tho se six hund red worl ds are in the position of the ass emblage poi nt. Incalcu labl e amounts of energ y are requ ired to make sense out of this answer. We have the energy. What we lack is the faci lity or disposition to use it. \" I coul d add that nothi ng could be truer than a ll these stat ements, and yet, nothi ng could make l ess sense. Don Jua n explained u sual percep tion in the term s in wh ich the sorcer e rs of his lineage under stood it: The ass emblage poi nt, at its habi tual location, receives an inf lo w of energy fiel ds fro m t he un iverse a t lar ge in the fo rm of luminou s fil aments, numbe ri ng in the trillions. Sinc e its position is consist ently the same, it stood to sorcer e rs' reasoning that the same energy fiel ds, in the for m of luminous fil aments, converge on the ass emblage poi nt and go through it, giving as a c onsistent result the perception of the worl d that we know. Tho se sorcer e rs arr ived at the unavoi dable conclusion that if the ass emblage poi nt were displ aced to another pos itio n, another set of energy fil aments woul d go through it, resulting in the pe rcepti on of a wo rl d that, by definition, was not the sa me as the worl d of everyday life. In don Jua n's opinion, what human be ings ord in ari ly regard as percei vi ng is rather the act of inter preting sensory data. He ma intai ne d that from the m oment of birth, everything arou nd us suppli es us with a possibi li t y of inter pretation, and that with time, this possibi lity turns into a ful l sys tem by m e ans of which we conduct all of our percep tual transactions in the world. He pointed out that the ass emblage point is not onl y the center whe re percep t io n is ass embled, bu t also the center where the inter pretation of sensory data is accomplished, so that if it were to change lo cations, it woul d interpret the new inf lux of energy fiel ds in very much the same terms in wh ich it inter prets the world of everyday"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"li fe. The resu lt of this new interpretation is the pe rcepti on of a wo rl d which is strangely simil ar to ours, and yet intrinsic a ll y different. D on Juan said that ene rgeticall y, th ose other worlds are as dif ferent from our s as they coul d possibly be. It is onl y the inter pre tati on of the ass emblage point which acco unts for the s eeming simi larities. Don Juan ca ll ed for a new synta x that coul d be us ed in ord e r to express this wondr ous qual ity of the ass emblage point and the possibili ties of perception brought about by dreami n g. He conc eded, howev er, that perh aps the present syntax of our language could be for ce d to cover it if this experience became availabl e to any one of us, and not merely to shaman initiates . Somethin g related to dreaming that was of tre mendou s inter est t o me, hut which bewil dered me to no end, was don Juan's stat em ent that there was reall y no pro cedure to speak of that woul d teach anyone how to dr eam. He said that more than anything else, dreaming was an ardu ous effor t on the part of the practitioners to put themselves in contact with the ind escr ibable all - pe rvadin g for ce that the sorcer e rs of a nci ent Mexico called intent. Once this li nk w as esta bli shed , dreaming also mys ter io usly became esta bli shed. Don Jua n ass erted that this li nkage could be accomplishe d fol lo wing a ny pattern that i mplied disc iplin e. When I aske d him to give me a succin ct explanation of the procedures invol ved, he laughed at me. \"To venture into the world of sorcerers,\" he said, \"is not li ke learning to dri ve a car. To dri ve a ca r, y ou need manuals and instruc tions. To dr eam, you need to intend it. \" \"But ho w can I intend it?\" I insist ed. \"The only way you coul d intend it is by intend ing it,\" he declared. \"One of the most dif ficu lt things for a man of our day to accept is a lack of pro cedure.

The execution of the magical passes gav e those sorcer ers the stability and the ene rgy necessary to call forth their dreaming attention, without which the re was no possi bility of dreaming for them. Wi thout the emergence of dreami ng attention, practi tioners could aspire, at best, to have luc id dreams about phantasmagoric a l worlds. They coul d perh aps have views of worl ds that generate energy, but these would make no sens e t o them whats oe ver in t he absence of an all - inclusive rationale that would properl y categor ize them. Once the shamans of don J uan's lineage had developed t heir dreaming attention, they reali zed that they had tapped on the doors of infini ty. They had succe eded in enlarging the parameters of their normal pe rcepti on. They discovered that their normal stat e of awareness was inf ini tely more varied than it had been befor e the advent of their dreami ng attention. From that point on, those sorcer e rs could truthfull y venture into the unkno wn. \"The a phorism,\" don Juan said to me once, \" that 'the sky is the limit' was most appl icable to the sorcerers of ancient times. They certain ly outdid themselves .\" \"Was i t reall y tr ue for them that the sky was the l imi t, don Ju a n?\" I aske d. \"Thi s ques tion c ould be answered onl y by eac h of us individ ually,\" he said, smiling expansively. \"They gav e u s the tool s.

He defined it as a natural stat e of human percep t io n in which thoug hts are blo cked off an d all of man's facul ties operate fro m a level of awareness which doesn't r equire the utilization of our daily cognitiv e sys tem. Inner silence has always been ass oci ated with darknes s, for the shamans of don Jua n's li neage, perhaps because human percep tio n, de pri ved of its habi tual companion, the inter nal dialogue, falls into someth ing that resembles a dark pit. He said that the body func tions as usual, hut awareness becomes sharper. Decision s are instantaneous, and seem to stem fro m a special sort of know ledge which is deprived of thoug ht verbali zations . Human percep t io n functi oning in a cond ition of inner silenc e , accordin g to don Jua n, is capabl e of reaching ind escr ibable levels. Some of those levels of percep tion are worl ds in themselves , and not at a ll li ke the worlds reached throu gh dreaming. They are ind escribable st ates , inexpl icable in terms of the linear paradigms that the habitual sta te of human perception employs fo r explaining the u niverse. Inner silenc e, in don Juan's under stand ing, is the matrix for a gigantic step of evoluti on: silent knowledge, or the level of human aware ness where knowin g is automatic and instantaneous. Knowl edge at th is l evel is not the produ ct of cerebral cogitation or logical ind uct io n a nd deduction, or of generalizat io ns bas ed on simil a ri ties and dissimilari t ies.

"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" Don Juan believed that silent knowledge was insin uated to early man, but that early man was not reall y the possessor of silent knowledge. Such an insin uation was inf initely stronger than what modern man exper iences, where the bul k of know ledge is the pro duct of rote learning. It is a sorcer ers' axiom that althou gh we have lo st that insin uation , the avenue that leads to silent knowledge will always be open to man by means of inner silence. Don Juan M atus taught the hard line of his l ineage: that inn er silence must be g ained by a consistent pressure of discipline. It has to be accru ed or stored, bit by bit, second by second. In other words, one has to force oneself to be silent, even if it is only for a few seconds. Accor ding to don Ju an, it was common knowledge among sorcer ers that if one persists in this, persistence overcomes habi t, and thus, it is possibl e to arrive at a threshol d of accrued seconds or minu tes, wh ich dif fe rs fro m pe rson to person. If the threshol d of inner silenc e i s ten minutes for a gi ven individ ual, for instance, the n once this thresho ld is reached, inner silence happens by itself, of its own accord, so to speak. I was warned befor ehand t hat there was no possibl e way of knowing what my ind iv idu al th reshol d might be, and that the onl y way of fin din g this out was throu gh dir ect exper ience.

Such a classifi catory scheme had nothing to do with intellectual spec ulations on the part of those sorcer ers, or with lo gica l conclusions abou t possibili ties of distribution of mass in the bod y. When don Juan exp lai ne d this to me, I countered that moder n biolo gists had the conc ept of bilateral sym metry, which means \"a basic bod y plan in which the left and ri ght sides of the organi sm can be d iv ided into ap pro ximate mirror images of each other alon g the midline.\" \"The c lassific ations of the shamans of anci ent M exico, \" don Jua n replied, \"were more pro found than the conclusions of modern scie ntists, because they stemmed fro m percei ving e nergy dir ectly as it flo ws in the universe. When t he human body is perceived as energy, it is utterly patent that it is composed not of two parts, but of two different types of energy: two different c urr ents of energ y, two opposing and at the same nine compl ementar y for ces that coexist side by side, mirroring, in th is fashion, the dual structure o f ev erything i n the universe at lar ge. \" The shamans of ancient Mexic o accorded each - one of these two different kinds of energy the stat ure of a tota l body, and spoke ex cl usively in terms of the left body and the ri ght bod y. Their emphasis was on the left body, because they consid ered it to be the most effective, in terms of the nature of its energy conf iguration, for the ultimate goals of shamanism. The shamans of ancient Mexico, wh o depicted the two bodies as streams of energy, depi cted the left stream as bein g more tu rbulent and agg ressive, moving in undulating ripples and projecting out w aves of e nergy.

Ther efor e, women were all owed to ex ecute t he move ments as a token of soli dari ty. In don Juan's time, the divi sion li nes between males and females became even more dif fused.

However, if it is ca refu lly scrut ini zed , it is immedi ately apparent that it is, rather, an unmistak able sensat io n of readiness that plac es the practi tioners at a level from which they could strike toward the unknown. Another reason that the shamans of anci e nt Mexico called this group of magica l passes Masculin ity was because the males who practi ced it became a special type of practi tioner who didn't need to be ta ken by t he h and.

For don J uan Matus's disci ples, this set of ma gical passes became the most cru cial element in their training. Don Jua n himself introduc e d it to them as a common denomi nator, meaning that he urged them to practi ce the set unaltered. What li e wanted was to prep are his disciples to withstand the ri go rs of journeying in the unkno wn. In Tensegrity, the word Series has been added t o the name Masculin ity to put it on a par with the other series of Tens egrity.

Don Juan said that th ey asserted that vital energy moves alon g the body via an exclusive track formed by tendons. I aske d don Juan if by tend on he meant the tissue that attaches the mu scles to the bon es. \"I am a t a loss to explain t endon energy ,\" he s aid. \"I'm fol lo wing t he eas y path of usage.

But that is a paragon of suc cess . At the moment, what we have at hand, as i n your case, is the a verage situation o f tendo n energy beginning at t he neck at the plac e where it joins the head. In so me cases tendon energy goes up to a poi nt belo w the cheekbo nes, but never higher tha n that poin t. \"Thi s ene rgy,\" he went on, \"wh ich I ca ll tend on energy for lack of a better name, is a dir e neces sity in the lives of those who travel in infinity, or want to travel in it.\" Don Juan said that the tra ditional beginning in th e utilization of tend on ene rgy was the use of some simple devices which were emplo yed by the shamans of anci ent Mexico in two ways . One was to cr eate a vi brator y effect on specific centers of tendon energy , an d the other was to crea te a pressure effect on the same centers. He explain ed that those shamans consid ered the vibrato ry effect to be th e agent for lo osening the energy which has become stag nant. The second effect, the pr ess ure effect, was thought to be the agent that disperses the energy. What seems to be a cogniti ve contr adic tion for moder n man - that vibrati on would lo osen anything that was stuck, and that pressure woul d disper se it - was deeply emphasized by don J uan Matus, who taught his disci ples that what appears to be natural to us in terms of our cognition in the wo rl d is not at all natural in terms of the flo w of energy. He said that in the worl d of ever yday li fe, human beings woul d crack something with a blo w, or by appl ying pressure, and disper se it by making it vib rate. However, energy which had become lo dged in a ten don center had to be rend ered fluid throu gh vibration, and then it had to be pressed, so that it woul d conti nue flo wing . Don Juan Matus was hor ri fied at the idea of dir ectly pressing poi nts of energy in the bod y withou t the preliminary vibration. His c ontention was that energy that was stuck woul d get ev en mor e in ert if press ure were applied to it. "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" Don Juan s tarted off his disci ples with two basic devices. He explained that the shamans of anci e nt times used to search for a pair of round pebbl es or dry round seed pods, and use them a s vibrato ry and pressure devices to ai d in manip ulating the flo w of energy in the bod y, which they be li eved becomes periodically stuck along the tend on track. However, the ro und pebbles that shaman practition ers normally used were defi nitely too hard , and the seed pod s too fragil e. Other objects that those shamans searched for avidly were flat roc ks the size of the hand or pieces of heavy wood, in ord e r to plac e them on specif ic areas of DEVICES USED IN CONJU NCTION WITH SPECIFI C MAGICAL PASSES » 219 tendon ene rgy on their abdomens while they were lyin g flat on their backs.

Tensegrity pra ctitioners have fou nd a much be tter equi valent to the devices of the shamans of anci e nt Mexico: a pair of round balls and a small, flat, circular leather weight. The ball s are the same size as the ones used by t hose s hamans, but t hey are n ot fragil e at a ll ; they are made of a mixture of Teflon reinforced by a ceramic compound.

It is li ght enough not to cause any discomf ort, and yet heavy enough to aid some specifi c magical passes that foster inn er silenc e by pressing centers on the abdomen.
