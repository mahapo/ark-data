To reach it he had the aid of mescalito, yerba del diablo, andhumito—peyote, datura, and mushrooms. But this is no mere recounting ofhallucinatory experience, for Don Juan’s subtle manipulations have guided thetraveler while his interpretations give meaning to the events that we, throughthe sorcerer’s apprentice, have the opportunity to experience.Anthropology has taught us that the world is differently defined in differentplaces. It is not only that people have different customs; it is not only thatpeople believe in different gods and expect different post-mortem fates. It is,rather, that the worlds of different peoples have different shapes. The verymetaphysical presuppositions differ: space does not conform to Euclideangeometry, time does not form a continuous unidirectional flow, causation doesnot conform to Aristotelian logic, man is not differentiated from non-man orlife from death, as in our world.We know something of the shape of these other worlds from the logic of nativelanguages and from myths and ceremonies, as recorded by anthropologists. DonJuan has shown us glimpses of the world of Yaqui sorcerer, and because we see itunder the influence of hallucinogenic substances, we apprehend it with a realitythat is utterly different from those other sources. This is the special virtueof this work.Castaneda rightly asserts that this world, for all its differences ofperception, has its own inner logic. He has tried to explain it from inside, asit were—from within his own rich and intensely personal experiences while underDon Juan’s tutelage—rather then to examine it in terms of our logic. That hecannot entirely succeed in this is a limitation that our culture and our ownlanguage place on perception, rather than his personal limitation; yet in hisefforts he bridges for us the world of a Yaqui sorcerer with our own, the worldof non-ordinary reality with the world of ordinary reality.The central importance of entering into worlds other then our own—and hence ofanthropology itself—lies in the fact that the experience leads us to understandthat our own world is also a cultural construct. By experiencing other worlds,then, we see our own for what it is and are thereby enabled also to seefleetingly what the real world, the one between our own cultural construct andthose other worlds, must in fact be like. Hence the allegory, as well as theethnography. The wisdom and poetry of Don Juan, and the skill and poetry of hisscribe, give us a vision both of ourselves and of reality. As in all properallegory, what one sees lies with the beholder, and needs no exegesis here.Carlos Castaneda’s interviews with Don Juan were initiated while he was astudent of anthropology at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles. We are indebted to him for his patience, his courage,and his perspicacity in seeking out and facing the challenge of his dualapprenticeship, and in reporting to us the details of his experiences. In thiswork he demonstrates the essential skill of good ethnography—the capacity toenter into an alien world. I believe he has found a path with heart.Walter GoldschmidtACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI wish to express profound gratitude to Professor Clement Meighan, who startedand set the course of my anthropological fieldwork; to Professor HaroldGarfinkel, who gave me the model and spirit of exhaustive inquiry; to ProfessorRobert Edgerton, who criticized my work from its beginning; to ProfessorsWilliam Bright and Pedro Carrasco for their criticism and encouragement; and toProfessor Lawrence Watson for his invaluable help in the clarification of myanalysis.

The eventsI describe here began during one of my trips. I was waiting in a border town foraGreyhound bus talking with a friend who had been my guide and helper in thesurvey. Suddenly he leaned towards me and whispered that the man, a white-hairedold Indian, who was sitting in front of the window was very learned aboutplants, especially peyote. I asked my friend to introduce me to this man.My friend greeting him, then went over and shook his hand.After they had talked for a while, my friend signaled me to join them, butimmediately left me alone with the old man, not even bothering to introduce us.He was not in the least embarrassed.I told him my name and he said that he was called Juan and that he was at myservice. He used the Spanish polite form of address.We shook hands at my initiative and then remained silent for some time. It wasnot a strained silence, but a quietness, natural and relaxed on both sides.Though his dark face and neck were wrinkled, showing his age, it struck me thathis body was agile and muscular.I then told him that I was interested in obtaining information about medicinalplants. Although in truth I was almost totally ignorant about peyote, I foundmyself pretending that I knew a great deal, and even suggesting that it might beto his advantage to talk with me. As I rattled on, he nodded slowly and lookedat me, but said nothing. I avoided his eyes and we finished by standing, the twoof us, in dead silence. Finally, after what seemed a very long time, Don Juangot up and looked out of the window. His bus had come. He said good-bye and leftthe station.I was annoyed at having talked nonsense to him, and at being seen through bythose remarkable eyes. When my friend returned he tried to console me for myfailure to learn anything from Don Juan. He explained that the old man was oftensilent or noncommittal, but the disturbing effect of this first encounter wasnot so easily dispelled.I made a point of finding out where Don Juan lived, and later visited himseveral times. On each visit I tried to lead him to discuss peyote, but withoutsuccess. We became, nonetheless, very good friends, and my scientificinvestigation was forgotten or was at least redirected into channels that wereworlds apart from my original intention.The friend who had introduced me to Don Juan explained later that the old manwas not a native of Arizona, where we met, but was a Yaqui Indian from Sonora,Mexico.At first I saw Don Juan simply as a rather peculiar man who knew a great dealabout peyote and who spoke Spanish remarkably well. But the people with whom helived believed that he had some sort of “secret knowledge”, that he was a“brujo”.The Spanish word brujo means, in English, medicine man, curer, witch, sorcerer.It connotes essentially a person who has extraordinary, and usually evil,powers.I had known Don Juan for a whole year before he took me into his confidence. Oneday he explained that he possessed a certain knowledge that he had learned froma teacher, a “benefactor” as he called him, who had directed him in a kind ofapprenticeship. Don Juan had, in turn, chosen me to serve as his apprentice, buthe warned me that I would have to make a very deep commitment and that thetraining was long and arduous.In describing his teacher, Don Juan used the word “diablero”.Later I learned that diablero is a term used only by the Sonoran Indians. Itrefers to an evil person who practises black sorcery and is capable oftransforming himself into an animal—a bird, a dog, a coyote, or any othercreature. On one of my visits toSonora I had a peculiar experience that illustrated the Indians” feeling aboutdiableros. I was driving at night in the company of two Indian friends when Isaw an animal that seemed to be a dog crossing the highway. One of my companionssaid it was not a dog, but a huge coyote. I slowed down and pulled to the sideof the road to get good look at the animal. It stayed within range of theheadlights a few seconds longer and then ran into the chaparral. It wasunmistakably a coyote, but it was twice the ordinary size. Talking excitedly, myfriends agreed that it was a very unusual animal, and one of them suggested thatit might be a diablero. I decided to use an account of the experience toquestion the Indians of that aria about their beliefs in the existence ofdiableros. I talked with many people, telling them the story asking themquestions. The three conversations that follow indicate what they felt.“Do you think it was a coyote, Choy?” I asked a young man after he heard thestory.“Who knows? A dog, no doubt. Too large for a coyote.”“Do you think it may have been a diablero?”“That’s a lot of bull. There are no such things.”“Why do you say that, Choy?”“People imagine things. I bet if you had caught that animal you would have seenthat it was a dog. Once I had some business in another town and got up beforedaybreak and saddled up a horse. As I was leaving I came upon a dark shadow onthe road which looked as a huge animal. My horse reared, throwing me off thesaddle. I was pretty scared too, but it turned out that the shadow was a womenwho was walking to town.”“Do you mean, Choy, that you don’t believe there are diableros?”“Diableros! What’s a diablero? Tell me what a diablero is!”“I don’t know, Choy. Manuel, who was riding with me that night, said the coyotecould have been a diablero. Maybe you could tell me what a diablero is?”“A diablero, they say, is a brujo who changes into any form he wants to adopt.But everybody knows that is pure bull. The old people here are full of storiesabout diableros. You won’t find that among us younger people.”“What kind of animal do you think it was, donna Luz?” I asked a middle-agedwoman.“Only God knows that for sure, but I think it was not a coyote. There are thingsthat appear to be coyotes, but are not.Was the coyote running, or was it eating?”“It was standing most of the time, but when I first saw it, I think it waseating something.”“Are you sure it was not carrying something in its mouth?”“Perhaps it was. But tell me, would that make any difference?”“Yes it would. If it was carrying something in its mouth it was not a coyote.”“What was it then?”“It was a man or a woman.”“What do you call such people, donna Luz?”She did not answer. I questioned her a while longer, but without success.Finally she said she did not know. I asked her if such people were calleddiableros, and she answered that “diableros” was one of the names given to them.“Do you know any diableros?” I asked.“I knew one woman,” she replied. “She was killed. It happened when I was alittle girl. The woman, they said, used to turn into a female dog. And one nighta dog went into the house of a white man to steal cheese. The white man kill thedog with a shotgun, and at very moment the dog died in the house of the whiteman the woman died in her own hut. Her kin got together and went to the whiteman and demanded payment.The white man paid good money for having killed her.”“How could they demand payment if it was only a dog he killed?”“They said that the white man knew it was not a dog, because other people werewith him, and they all saw that the dog stood up on its legs like a man andreached for the cheese, which was on a tray hanging from the roof. The men werewaiting for the thief because the white man’s cheese was being stolen everynight.So the man killed the thief knowing it was not a dog.”“Are there any diableros, nowadays, donna Luz?”“Such things are very secret. They say there are no more diableros, but I doubtit, because one member of a diablero’s family has to learn what the diableroknows. Diableros have their own laws, and one of them is that a diablero has toteach his secrets to one of his kin.”“What do you think the animal was, Genaro?” I asked a very old man.“A dog from one of the ranchos of that area. What else?”“It could have been a diablero!”“A diablero? You are crazy! There are no diableros.”“Do you mean that there are none today, or that there never were any?”“At one time there were, yes. It is common knowledge. Everybody knows that. Butthe people were very afraid of them and had them all killed.”“Who killed them, Genaro?”“All the people of the tribe. The last diablero I knew about was S—. He killeddozens, maybe even hundreds, of people with his sorcery. We couldn’t put up withthat and the people got together and took him by surprise one night and burnedhim alive.”“How long ago was that, Genaro?”“It nineteen forty-two.”“Did you see it yourself?”“No, but people still talk about it. They say that there were no ashes left,even though the stake was made of fresh wood. All that was left at the end was ahuge pool of grease.”Although Don Juan categorized his benefactor as a diablero, he never mentionedthe place where he had acquired his knowledge, nor did he identify his teacher.In fact, Don Juan disclosed very little about his personal life. All he said wasthat he had been born in the Southwest on 1891; that he spent nearly all hislife in Mexico; that in 1900 his family was exiled by the Mexican government tocentral Mexico along with thousands of other Sonoran Indians; and that he livedin central and southern Mexico until 1940. Thus, as Don Juan had travelled agreat deal, his knowledge may have been the product of many influences.And although he regarded himself as an Indian from Sonora, I was not surewhether to place the context of his knowledge totally in the culture of theSonoran Indians. But it is not my intention here to determine his precisecultural milieu.I began to serve my apprenticeship to Don Juan in June 1961.Prior to that time I had seen him on various occasions, but always in thecapacity of an anthropological observer. During these early conversations I tooknotes in a covert manner. Later, relying on my memory, I reconstructed theentire conversation.When I began to participate as an apprentice, however, that method of takingnotes became very difficult, because our conversations touched on many differenttopics. Then Don Juan allowed me—under strong protest, however—to record openlyanything that was said. I would also have liked to take photographs and maketape recordings, but he would not permit me to do so.I carried out the apprenticeship first in Arizona and then inSonora, because Don Juan moved to Mexico during the course of my training. Theprocedure I employed was to see him for a few days every so often. My visitsbecame more frequent and lasted longer during the summer months of 1961, 1962,1963, and 1964. In retrospect, I believe this method of conducting theapprenticeship prevented the training from being successful, because it retardedthe advent of the full commitment I needed to become a sorcerer. Yet the methodwas beneficial from my personal standpoint in that it allowed me a modicum ofdetachment, and that in turn fostered a sense of critical examination whichwould have been impossible to attain had I participate continuously, withoutinterrupt. In September 1965, I voluntarily discontinued the apprenticeship.Several months after my withdrawal, I considered for the first time the idea ofarranging my field notes in a systematic way.As the data I had collected were quite voluminous, and included muchmiscellaneous information, I began by trying to establish a classificationsystem. I divided the data into areas of related concepts and procedures andarranged the areas hierarchically according to subjective importance—that is, interms of the impact that each of them had had on me. In that way I arrived atthe following classification: uses of the hallucinogenic plants; procedures andformulas used in sorcery; acquisition and manipulation of power objects; uses ofthe medicinal plants; songs and legends.Reflecting upon the phenomena I had experienced, I realized that my attempt atclassification had produced nothing more than an inventory of categories; anyattempt to refine my scheme would therefore yield only a more complex inventory.That was not what I wanted. During the months following my withdrawal from theapprenticeship, I needed to understand what I had experienced, and what I hadexperienced was the teaching of a coherent system of beliefs by means of apragmatic and experimental method. It had been evident to me from the very firstsession in which I had participated that Don Juan’s teachings possessed aninternal cohesion. Once he had definitely decided to communicate his knowledgeto me, he proceeded to present his explanations in orderly steps. To discoverthat order and to understand it proved to be a most difficult task for me.My inability to arrive at an understanding seems to have been traceable to thefact that, after four years of apprenticeship, I was still a beginner. It wasclear that Don Juan’s knowledge and his method of conveying it were those of hisbenefactor; thus my difficulties in understanding his teachings must have beenanalogous to those he himself had encountered. Don Juan alluded to oursimilarity as beginners through incidental comments about his incapacity tounderstand his teacher during his own apprenticeship. Such remarks led me tobelieve that to any beginner, Indian or non-Indian, the knowledge of sorcery wasrendered incomprehensible by the outlandish characteristics of the phenomena heexperienced. Personally, as a Western man, I found these characteristics sobizarre that it was virtually impossible to explain them in terms of my owneveryday life, and I was forced to the conclusion that any attempt to classifymy field data in my own terms would be futile.Thus it became obvious to me that Don Juan’s knowledge had to be examined interms of how he himself understood it; only in such terms could it be madeevident and convincing.In trying to reconcile my own views with Don Juan’s, however, I realized thatwhenever he tried to explain his knowledge to me, he used concepts that wouldrender it “intelligible” to him. As those concepts were alien to me, trying tounderstand his knowledge in the way he did placed me in another untenableposition.Therefore, my first task was to determine his order of conceptualization. Whileworking in that direction, I saw that Don Juan himself had placed particularemphasis on a certain area of his teachings—specifically, the uses ofhallucinogenic plants. On the basis of this realization, I revised my own schemeof categories.Don Juan used, separately and on different occasions, three hallucinogenicplants: peyote (Lophophora williamsii), Jimson weed (Datura inoxia syn. D.meteloides), and a mushroom (possibly Psilocybe mexicana). Since before theircontact with Europeans, American Indians have known the hallucinogenicproperties of these three plants. Because of their properties, the plants havebeen widely employed for pleasure, for curing, for witchcraft, and for attaininga state of ecstasy. In the specific context of his teachings, Don Juan relatedthe use of Datura inoxia and Psilocybe mexicana to the acquisition of power, apower he called an “ally”. He related the use of Lophophora williamsii to theacquisition of wisdom, or the knowledge of the right way to live.The importance of the plants was, for Don Juan, their capacity to produce stagesof peculiar perception in a human being. Thus he guided me into experiencing asequence of these stages for the purpose of unfolding and validating hisknowledge. I have called them “states of non-ordinary reality”, meaning unusualreality as opposed to the ordinary reality of everyday life. The distinction isbased on the inherent meaning of the states of nonordinary reality. In thecontext of Don Juan’s knowledge they were considered as real, although theirreality was differentiated from ordinary reality.Don Juan believed the states of non-ordinary reality to be the only form ofpragmatic learning and the only means of acquiring power. He conveyed theimpression that other parts of his teachings were incidental to the acquisitionof power. The point of view permeated Don Juan’s attitude toward everything notdirectly connected with the states of non-ordinary reality. Throughout my fieldnotes there are scattered references to the way don Juan felt. For example, inone conversation he suggested that some objects have a certain amount of powerin themselves.Although he himself had no respect for power objects, he said they werefrequently used as aids by lesser brujos. I often asked him about such objects,but he seemed totally uninterested in discussing them. When the topic was raisedagain on another occasion, however, he reluctantly consented to talk about them.“There are certain objects that are permeated with power,” he said. “There arescores of such objects which are fostered by powerful men with the aid offriendly spirits. These objects are tools—not ordinary tools, but tools ofdeath. Yet they only instruments; they have no power to teach. Properlyspeaking, they are in the realm of was objects designed for strife; they aremade to kill, to be hurled.”“What kind of objects are they, Don Juan?”“They are not really objects; rather, they are types of power.”“How can one get those types of power, Don Juan?”“That depends on the kind of object you want.”“How many kinds are there?”“As I have already said, there are scores of them. Anything can be a powerobject.”“Well, which are the most powerful, then?”“The power of an object depends on its owner, on the kind of man he is. A powerobject fostered by a lesser brujo is almost a joke; on the other hand, a strong,powerful brujo gives his strength to his tools.”“Which power objects are most common, then? Which ones do most brujos prefer?”“There are no preferences. They are all power objects, all just the same.”“Do you have any yourself, Don Juan?”He did not answer; he just looked at me and laughed. He remained quiet for along time, and I thought my questions were annoying him.“There are limitations on those types of powers,” he went on. “But such a pointis, I am sure, incomprehensible to you.It has taken me nearly a lifetime to understand that, by itself, an ally canreveal all the secrets of these lesser powers, rendering them rather childish. Ihad tools like that at one time, when I was very young.”“What power objects did you have?”“Maiz-pinto, crystals and feathers.”“What is maiz-pinto, Don Juan?”“It is a small kernel of corn which has a streak of red colour in its middle.”“It is a single kernel?”“No. A brujo owns forty-eight kernels.”“What do the kernels do, Don Juan?”“Each one of them can kill a man by entering into his body.”“How does a kernel enter into a human body?”“It is a power object and its power consists, among other things, in enteringinto the body.”“What does it do when it enters into the body?”“It immerses itself in the body; it settles on the chest, or on the intestines.The man becomes ill, and unless the brujo who is tending him is stronger thanthe bewitcher, he will die within three months from the moment the kernelentered into his body.”“Is there any way of curing him?”“The only way is to suck the kernel out, but very few brujos would dare to dothat. A brujo may succeed in sucking the kernel out, but unless he is powerfulenough to repel it, it will get inside him and will kill him instead.”“But how does a kernel manage to enter into someone’s body?”“To explain that I must tell you about corn witchcraft, which is one of the mostpowerful witchcrafts I know. The witchcraft is done by two kernels. One of themis put inside a fresh bud of a yellow flower. The flower is then set on a spotwhere it will come into contact with the victim: the road on which he walksevery day, or any place where he is habitually present. As soon as the victimsteps on the kernel, or touches it in any way, the witchcraft is done. Thekernel immerses itself in the body.”“What happens to the kernel after the man has touched it?”“All its power goes inside the man, and the kernel is free. It becomes justanother kernel. It may be left at the side of the witchcraft, or it may be sweptaway; it does not matter. It is better to sweep it away into the underbrush,where a bird will eat it.”“Can a bird eat it before the man touches it?”“No. No bird is that stupid, I assure you. The birds stay away from it.”“Don Juan then described a very complex procedure by which such power kernelscan be obtained.“You must bear in mind that maiz-pinto is merely an instrument, not an ally,” hesaid. “Once you make that distinction you will have no problem. But if youconsider such tools to be supreme, you will be a fool.”“Are the power objects as powerful as an ally?” I asked.Don Juan laughed scornfully before answering. It seemed that he was trying hardto be patient with me.“Maiz-pinto, crystals, and feathers are mere toys in comparison with an ally,”he said. “These power objects are necessary only when a man does not have anally. It was a waste of time to pursue them, especially for you. You should betrying to get an ally; when you succeed, you will understand what I am tellingyou now. Power objects are like a game for children.”“Don’t get me wrong, Don Juan,” I protested. “I want to have an ally, but I alsowant to know everything I can. You yourself have said that knowledge is power.”“No!” he said emphatically. “Power rests on the kind of knowledge one holds.What is the sense of knowing things that are useless?”In Don Juan’s system of beliefs, the acquisition of an ally meant exclusivelythe exploration of the states of non-ordinary reality he produced in me throughthe use of hallucinogenic plants. He believed that by focusing on these statesand omitting other aspects of the knowledge he taught I would arrive at acoherent view of the phenomena I had experienced.I have therefore divided this book into two parts. In the first part I presentselection from my field notes dealing with the states of non-ordinary reality Iunderwent during my apprenticeship. As I have arranged my notes to fit thecontinuity of the narrative, they are not always in proper chronologicalsequence.I never wrote my description of a state of non-ordinary reality until severaldays after I had experienced it, waiting until I was able to treat it calmly andobjectively. My conversations with don Juan, however, were taken down as theyoccurred, immediately after each state of non-ordinary reality. My reports ofthese conversations, therefore, sometimes antedate the full description of anexperience.My field notes disclose the subjective version of what I perceived whileundergoing the experience. That version is presented here just as I narrated itto Don Juan, who demanded a complete and faithful recollection of every detailand a full recounting of each experience. At the time of recording theseexperience, I added incidental details in an attempt to recapture the totalsetting of each state of non-ordinary reality. I wanted to describe theemotional impact I had experienced as completely as possible.My field notes also reveal the content of Don Juan’s system of beliefs. I havecondensed long pages of questions and answers between Don Juan and myself inorder to avoid reproducing the repetitiveness of conversation. But as I alsowant to reflect accurately the overall mood of our exchanges, I have deletedonly dialogue that contributed nothing to my understanding of his way ofknowledge. The information Don Juan gave me about his way of knowledge wasalways sporadic, and for every spurt on his part there were hours of probing onmine. Nevertheless, there were innumerable occasions on which he freelyexpounded his knowledge.In the second part of this book I present a structural analysis drownexclusively from the data reported in the first part.Through my analysis I seek to support the following contentions: (1) Don Juanpresented his teachings as a system of logical thought; (2) the system madesense only if examined in the light of its structural units; and (3) the systemwas devised to guide an apprentice to a level of conceptualization whichexplained the order of the phenomena he had experienced.Part OneTHE TEACHINGS1My notes on my first session with Don Juan are dated 23 June 1961. That was theoccasion when the teachings began. I had seen him several times previously inthe capacity of on observer only. At every opportunity I had asked him to teachme about peyote. He ignored my request every time, but he never completelydismissed the subject, and I interpreted his hesitancy as a possibility that hemight be inclined to talk about his knowledge with more coaxing.In this particular session he made it obvious to me that he might consider myrequest provided I possessed clarity of mind and purpose in reference to what Ihad asked him. It was impossible for me to fulfil such a condition, for I hadasked him to teach me about peyote only as a means of establishing a link ofcommunication with him. I thought his familiarity with the subject mightpredispose him to be more open and willing to talk, thus allowing me an entranceinto his knowledge on the properties of plants. He had interpreted my requestliterally, however, and was concerned about my purpose in wishing to learn aboutpeyote.Friday, 23 June 1961“Would you teach me about peyote, Don Juan?”“Why would you like to undertake such learning?”“I really would like to know about it. Is not just to want to know a goodreason?”“No! You must search in your heart and find out why a young man like you wantsto undertake such a task of learning.”“Why did you learn about it yourself, Don Juan?”“Why do you ask that?”“Maybe we both have the same reasons.”“I doubt that. I am an Indian. We don’t have the same paths.”“The only reason I have is that I want to learn about it, just to know. But Iassure you, Don Juan, my intentions are not bad.”“I believe you. I’ve smoked you.”“I beg your pardon!”“It doesn’t matter now. I know your intentions.”“Do you mean you saw through me?”“You could put it that way.”“Will you teach me, then?”“No!”“Is it because I’m not an Indian?”“No. It is because you don’t know your heart. What is important is that you knowexactly why you want to involve yourself. Learning about “Mescalito” is a mostserious act. If you were an Indian your desire alone would be sufficient. Veryfew Indians have such a desire.”Sunday, 25 June 1961I stayed with Don Juan all afternoon on Friday. I was going to leave about 7p.m. We were sitting on the porch in front of his house and I decided to ask himonce more about the teaching. It was almost a routine question and I expectedhim to refuse again. I asked him if there was a way in which he could acceptjust my desire to learn, as if I were an Indian. He took a long time to answer.I was compelled to stay because he seemed to trying to decide something.Finally he told me that there was a way, and proceeded to delineate a problem.He pointed out that I was very tired sitting on the floor, and that the properthing to do was to find a “spot” (sitio) on the floor where I could sit withoutfatigue. I had been sitting with my knees up against my chest and my arms lockedaround my calves. When he said I was tired, I realized that my back ached andthat I was quite exhausted.I waited for him to explain what he meant by a “spot”, but he made no overtattempt to elucidate the point. I thought that perhaps he meant that I shouldchange positions, so I got up and sat closer to him. He protested at my movementand clearly emphasized that a spot meant a place where a man could feelnaturally happy and strong. He patted the place where he sat and said it was hisown spot, adding that he had posed a riddle I had to solve by myself any furtherdeliberation.What he had posed as a problem to be solved was certainly a riddle. I had noidea how to begin or even what he had in mind.Several times I asked for a clue, or at least a hint, as to how to proceed inlocating a point where I felt happy and strong. I insisted and argued that I hadno idea what he really meant because I couldn’t conceive the problem. Hesuggested I walk around the porch until I found the spot.I got up and began to pace the floor. I felt silly and sat down in front of him.He became very annoyed with me and accused me of not listening, saying thatperhaps I did not want to learn. After a while he calmed down and explained tome that not every place was good to sit or be on, and that within the confinesof the porch there was one spot that was unique, a spot where I could be at myvery best. It was my task to distinguish it from all the other places. Thegeneral pattern was that I had to “feel” all the possible spots that wereaccessible until I could determine without a doubt which was the right one.I argued that although the porch was not too large (twelve by eight feet), thenumber of possible spots was overwhelming, and it would take me a very long timeto check all of them, and that since he had not specified the size of the spot,the possibilities might be infinite. My arguments were futile. He got up andvery sternly warned me that it might take me days to figure it out, but that ifI did not solve the problem, I might as well leave because he would have nothingto say to me. He emphasized that he knew where my spot was, and that therefore Icould not lie to him; he said this was the only way he could accept my desire tolearn about Mescalito as a valid reason. He added that nothing in his world wasa gift, that whatever there was to learn had to be learned the hard way.He went around the house to the chaparral to urinate. He returned directly intohis house through the back.I thought the assignment to find the alleged spot of happiness was his own wayof dismissing me, but I got up and started to pace back and forth. The sky wasclear. I could see everything on and near the porch. I must have paced for anhour or more, but nothing happened to reveal the location of the spot. I gottired of walking and sat down; after a few minutes I sat somewhere else, andthen at another place, until I had covered the whole floor in a semi-systematicfashion. I deliberately tried to “feel” differences between places, but I lackedthe criteria for differentiation.I felt I was wasting my time, but I stayed. My rationalization was that I hadcome a long way just to see Don Juan, and I really had nothing else to do.I lay down on my back and put my hands under my head like a pillow. Then Irolled over and lay on my stomach for a while.I repeated this rolling process over the entire floor. For the first time Ithought I had stumbled upon a vague criterion. I felt warmer when I lay on myback.I rolled again, this time in the opposite direction, and again covered thelength of the floor, lying face down on all the places where I had lain face upduring my first rolling tour. I experienced the same warm and cold sensations,depending on my position, but there was no difference between spots.Then an idea occurred to me which I thought to be brilliant: don Juan’s spot! Isat there, and then lay, face down at first, and later on my back, but the placewas just like all the others. I stood up. I had had enough. I wanted to saygood-bye to don Juan, but I was embarrassed to wake him up. I looked at mywatch.It was two o’clock in the morning! I had been rolling for six hours.At that moment don Juan came out and went around the house to the chaparral. Hecame back and stood at the door. I felt utterly dejected, and I wanted to saysomething nasty to him and leave. But I realized that it was not his fault; thatit was my own choice to go through all that nonsense. I told him I had failed; Ihad been rolling on his floor like an idiot all night and still couldn’t makeany sense of his riddle.He laughed and said that it did not surprise him because I had not proceededcorrectly. I had not been using my eyes. That was true, yet I was very sure hehad said to feel the difference. I brought that point up, but he argued that onecan feel with the eyes, when the eyes are not looking right into things. As faras I was concerned, he said, I had no other means to solve this problem but touse all I had—my eyes.He went inside. I was certain that he had been watching me.I thought there was no other way for him to know that I had not been using myeyes.I began to roll again, because that was the most comfortable procedure. Thistime, however, I rested my chin on my hands and looked at every detail.After an interval the darkness around me changed. When I focused on the pointdirectly in front of me, the whole peripheral area of my field of vision becamebrilliantly coloured with a homogeneous greenish yellow. The effect wasstartling. I kept my eyes fixed on the point in front of me and began to crawlsideways on my stomach, one foot at a time.Suddenly, at a point near the middle of the floor, I became aware of anotherchange in hue. At a place to my right, still in the periphery of my field ofvision, the greenish yellow became intensely purple. I concentrated my attentionon it. The purple faded into a pale, but still brilliant, colour which remainedsteady for the time I kept my attention on it.I marked the place with my jacket, and called don Juan. He came out to theporch. I was truly excited; I had actually seen the change in hues. He seemedunimpressed, but told me to sit on the spot and report to him what kind offeeling I had.I sat down and then lay on my back. He stood by me and asked me repeatedly how Ifelt; but I did not feel anything different.For about fifteen minutes I tried to feel or to see a difference, while don Juanstood by me patiently. I felt disgusted. I had a metallic taste in my mouth.Suddenly I had developed a headache. I was about to get sick. The thought of mynonsensical endeavours irritated me to a point of fury. I got up.Don Juan must have noticed my profound frustration. He did not laugh, but veryseriously stated that I had to be inflexible with myself if I wanted to learn.Only two choices were open to me, he said: either to quit and go home, in whichcase I would never learn, or to solve the riddle.He went inside again. I wanted to leave immediately, but I was too tired todrive; besides, perceiving the hues had been so startling that I was sure it wasa criterion of some sort, and perhaps there were other changes to be detected.Anyway, it was too late to leave. So I sat down, stretched my legs back, andbegan all over again.During this round I moved rapidly through each place, passing don Juan’s spot,to the end of the floor, and then turned around to cover the outer edge. When Ireached the centre, I realized that another change in colouration was takingplace, again on the edge of my field of vision. The uniform chartreuse I wasseeing all over the area turned, at one spot to my right, into a sharpverdigris. It remained for a moment and then abruptly metamorphosed into anothersteady hue, different from the other one I had detected earlier. I took off oneof my shoes and marked the point, and kept on rolling until I had covered thefloor in all possible directions. No other change of colouration took place.I came back to the point marked with my shoe, and examined it. It was locatedfive to six feet away from the spot marked by my jacket, in a southeasterlydirection. There was a large rock next to it. I lay down there for quite sometime trying to find clues, looking at every detail, but I did not feel anythingdifferent.I decided to try the other spot. I quickly pivoted on my knees and was about tolie down on my jacket when I felt an unusual apprehension. It was more like aphysical sensation of something actually pushing on my stomach. I jumped up andretreated in one movement. The hair on my neck pricked up. My legs had archedslightly, my trunk was bent forward, and my arms stuck out in front of merigidly with my fingers contracted like a claw.I took notice of my strange posture and my fright increased.I walked back involuntarily and sat down on the rock next to my shoe. From therock, I slumped to the floor. I tried to figure out what had happened to causeme such a fright. I thought it must have been the fatigue I was experiencing. Itwas nearly daytime. I felt silly and embarrassed. Yet I had no way to explainwhat had frightened me, nor had I figured out what don Juan wanted.I decided to give it one last try. I got up and slowly approached the placemarked by my jacket, and again I felt the same apprehension. This time I made astrong effort to control myself. I sat down, and then knelt in order to lie facedown, but I could not lie in spite of my will. I put my hands on the floor infront of me.My breathing accelerated; my stomach was upset. I had a clear sensation ofpanic, and fought not to run away. I thought don Juan was perhaps watching me.Slowly I crawled back to the other spot and propped my back against the rock. Iwanted to rest for a while to organize my thoughts, but I fell asleep.I heard don Juan talking and laughing above my head. I woke up.“You have found the spot,” he said.I did not understand him at first, but he assured me again that the place whereI had fallen asleep was the spot in question. He again asked me how I felt lyingthere. I told him I really did not notice any difference.He asked me to compare my feelings at that moment with what I had felt whilelying on the other spot. For the first time it occurred to me that I could notpossibly explain my apprehension of the preceding night. He urged me in a kindof challenging way to sit on the other spot. For some inexplicable reason I wasactually afraid of the other place, and did not sit on it. He asserted that onlya fool could fail to see the difference.I asked him if each of the two spots had a special name. He said that the goodone was called the sitio and the bad one the enemy; he said these two placeswere the key to a man’s wellbeing, especially for a man who pursuing knowledge.The sheer act of sitting on one’s spot created superior strength; on the otherhand, the enemy weakened a man and could even cause his death. He said I hadreplenished my energy, which I had spent lavishly the night before, by taking anap on my spot.He also said that the colours I had seen in association with each specific spothad the same overall effect either of giving strength or of curtailing it.I asked him if there were other spots for me like the two I had found, and how Ishould go about finding them. He said that many places in the world would becomparable to those two, and that the best way to find them was by detectingtheir respective colours.It was not clear to me whether or not I had solved the problem, and in fact Iwas not even convinced that there had been a problem; I could not avoid feelingthat the whole experience was forced and arbitrary. I was certain that don Juanhad watched me all night and then proceeded to humour me by saying that whereverI had fallen asleep was the place I was looking for. Yet I failed to see alogical reason for such an act, and when he challenged me to sit on the otherspot I could not do it. There was a strange cleavage between my pragmaticexperience of fearing the “other spot” and my rational deliberations about thetotal event.Don Juan, on the other hand, was very sure I had succeeded, and, acting inaccordance with my success, let me know he was going to teach me about peyote.“You asked me to teach about Mescalito,” he said. “I wanted to find out if youhad enough backbone to meet him face to face. Mescalito is not something to makefun of. You must have command over your resources. Now I know I can take yourdesire alone as a good reason to learn.”“You really are going to teach me about peyote?”“I prefer to call him Mescalito. Do the same.”“When are you going to start?”“It is not so simple as that. You must be ready first.”“I think I am ready.”“This is not a joke. You must wait until there is no doubt, and then you willmeet him.”“Do I have to prepare myself?”“No. You simply have to wait. You may give up the whole idea after a while. Youget tired easily. Last night you were ready to quit as soon as it got difficult.Mescalito requires a very serious intent.”2Monday, 7 August 1961I arrived at don Juan’s house in Arizona about seven o’clock onFriday night. Five other Indians were sitting with him on the porch of hishouse. I greeted him and sat waiting for them to say something. After a formalsilence one of the men got up, walked over to me, and said, “Buenas noches.” Istood up and answered, “Buenasnoches.” Then all the other men got up and came tome and we all mumbled “Buenas noches” and shook hands either by barely touchingone another’s finger-tips or by holding the hand for an instant and thendropping it quite abruptly.We all sat down again. They seemed to be rather shy—at a loss for words,although they all spoke Spanish.It must have been about half past seven when suddenly they all got up and walkedtowards the back of the house. Nobody had said a word for a long time. Don Juansignalled me to follow and we all got inside an old pickup truck parked there. Isat in the back with don Juan and two younger men. There were no cushions orbenches and the metal floor was painfully hard, especially when we left thehighway and got onto a dirt road.Don Juan whispered that we were going to the house of one of his friends who hadseven mescalitos for me.I asked him, “Don’t you have any of them yourself, don Juan?”“I do, but I couldn’t offer them to you. You see, someone else has to do this.”“Can you tell me why?”“Perhaps you are not agreeable to «him» and «he» won’t like you, and then youwill never be able to know «him» with affection, as one should; and ourfriendship will be broken.”“Why wouldn’t he like me? I have never done anything to him.”“You don’t have to do anything to be liked or disliked. He either takes you, orthrows you away.”“But, if he doesn’t take me, isn’t there anything I can do to make him like me?”The other two men seemed to have overheard my question and laughed.“No! I can’t think of anything one can do,” don Juan said.He turned half away from me and I could not talk to him any more.We must have driven for at least an hour before we stopped in front of a smallhouse. It was quite dark, and after the driver had turned off the headlights Icould make out only the vague contour of the building.A young woman, a Mexican, judging by her speech inflection, was yelling at a dogto make him stop barking. We got out of the truck and walked into the house. Themen mumbled “Buenas noches” as they went by her. She answered back and went onyelling at the dog.The room was large and was stacked up with a multitude of objects. A dim lightfrom a very small electric bulb rendered the scene quite gloomy. There werequite a few chairs with broken legs and sagging seats leaning against the walls.Three of the men sat down on a couch, which was the largest single piece offurniture in the room. It was very old and had sagged down all the way to thefloor; in the dim light it seemed to be red and dirty.The rest of us sat in chairs. We sat in silence for a long time.One of the men suddenly got up and went into another room.He was perhaps in his fifties, tall, and husky. He came back a moment later witha coffee jar. He opened the lid and handed the jar to me; inside there wereseven odd-looking items. They varied in size and consistency. Some of them werealmost round, others were elongated. They felt to the touch like the pulp ofwalnuts, or the surface of cork. Their brownish colour made them look like hard,dry nutshells. I handled them, rubbing their surfaces for quite some time.“This is to be chewed [esto se masca],” don Juan said in a whisper.I had not realized that he had sat next to me until he spoke.I looked at the other men, but no one was looking at me; they were talking amongthemselves in very low voices. This was a moment of acute indecision and fear. Ifelt almost unable to control myself.“I have to go to the bathroom,” I said to him. “I’ll go outside and take awalk.”He handed me the coffee jar and I put the peyote buttons in it.I was leaving the room when the man who had given me the jar stood up, came tome, and said he had a toilet bowl in the other room.The toilet was almost against the door. Next to it, nearly touching the toilet,was a large bed which occupied more than half of the room. The woman wassleeping there. I stood motionless at the door for a while, then I came back tothe room where the other men were.The man who owned the house spoke to me in English: “Don Juan says you’re fromSouth America. Is there any mescal there?”I told him that I had never even heard of it.They seemed to be interested in South America and we talked about the Indiansfor a while. Then one of the men asked me why I wanted to eat peyote. I told himthat I wanted to know what it was like. They all laughed shyly.Don Juan urged me softly,” Chew it, chew it [Masca, masca].”My hands were wet and my stomach contracted. The jar with the peyote buttons wason the floor by the chair. I bent over, took one at random, and put it in mymouth. It had a stale taste. I bit it in two and started to chew one of thepieces. I felt a strong, pungent bitterness; in a moment my whole mouth wasnumb. The bitterness increased as I kept on chewing, forcing an incredible flowof saliva. My gums and the inside of my mouth felt as if I had eaten salty, drymeat or fish, which seems to force one to chew more. After a while I chewed theother piece and my mouth was so numb I couldn’t feel the bitterness any more.The peyote button was a bunch of shreds, like the fibrous part of an orange orlike sugarcane, and I didn’t know whether to swallow it or spit it out. At thatmoment the owner of the house got up and invited everybody to go out to theporch.We went out and sat in the darkness. It was quite comfortable outside, and thehost brought out a bottle of tequila.The men were seated in a row with their backs to the wall. I was at the extremeright of the line. Don Juan, who was next to me, placed the jar with the peyotebuttons between my legs. Then he handed me the bottle, which was passed down theline, and told me to take some of the tequila to wash away the bitterness.I spat out the shreds of the first button and took a sip. He told me not toswallow it, but to just rinse out my mouth with it to stop the saliva. It didnot help much with the saliva, but it certainly helped to wash away some of thebitterness.Don Juan gave me a piece of dried apricot, or perhaps it was a dried fig—Icouldn’t see it in the dark, nor could I taste it—and told me to chew itthoroughly and slowly, without rushing. I had difficulty swallowing it; it feltas if it would not go down.After a short pause the bottle went around again. Don Juan handed me a piece ofcrispy dried meat. I told him I did not feel like eating.“This is not eating,” he said firmly.The pattern was repeated six times. I remember having chewed six peyote buttonswhen the conversation became very lively; although I could not distinguish whatlanguage was spoken, the topic of the conversation, in which everybodyparticipated, was very interesting, and I attempted to listen carefully so thatI could take part. But when I tried to speak I realized I couldn’t; the wordsshifted aimlessly about in my mind.I sat with my back propped against the wall and listened to what the men weresaying. They were talking in Italian, and repeated over and over one phraseabout the stupidity of sharks.I thought it was a logical, coherent topic. I had told don Juan earlier that theColorado River in Arizona was called by the early Spaniards “el rio de lostizones [the river of charred wood]”; and someone mis-spelled or misread“tizones”, and the river was called “el rio de los tiburones [the river of thesharks]”. I was sure they were discussing that story, yet it never occurred tome to think that none of them could speak Italian.I had a very strong desire to throw up, but I don’t recall the actual act. Iasked if somebody would get me some water. I was experiencing an unbearablethirst.Don Juan brought me a large saucepan. He placed it on the ground next to thewall. He also brought a little cup or can. He dipped it into the pan and handedit to me, and said I could not drink but should just freshen my mouth with it.The water looked strangely shiny, glossy, like a thick varnish.I wanted to ask don Juan about it and laboriously I tried to voice my thoughtsin English, but then I realized he did not speak English. I experienced a veryconfusing moment, and became aware of the fact that although there was a clearthought in my mind, I could not speak. I wanted to comment on the strangequality of the water, but what followed next was not speech; it was the feelingof my unvoiced thoughts coming out of my mouth in a sort of liquid form. It wasan effortless sensation of vomiting without the contractions of the diaphragm.It was a pleasant flow of liquid words.I drank. And the feeling that I was vomiting disappeared. By that time allnoises had vanished and I found I had difficulty focusing my eyes. I looked fordon Juan and as I turned my head I noticed that my field of vision haddiminished to a circular area in front of my eyes. This feeling was neitherfrightening nor discomforting, but, quite to the contrary, it was a novelty; Icould literally sweep the ground by focusing on one spot and then moving my headslowly in any direction. When I had first come out to the porch I had noticed itwas all dark except for the distant glare of the city lights. Yet within thecircular area of my vision everything was clear. I forgot about my concern withdon Juan and the other men, and gave myself entirely to exploring the groundwith my pinpoint vision.I saw the juncture of the porch floor and the wall. I turned my head slowly tothe right, following the wall, and saw don Juan sitting against it. I shifted myhead to the left in order to focus on the water. I found the bottom of the pan;I raised my head slightly and saw a medium-size black dog approaching. I saw himcoming towards the water. The dog began to drink. I raised my hand to push himaway from my water; I focused my pinpoint vision on the dog to carry on themovement, and suddenly I saw him become transparent. The water was a shiny,viscous liquid.I saw it going down the dog’s throat into his body. I saw it flowing evenlythrough his entire length and then shooting out through each one of the hairs. Isaw the iridescent fluid travelling along the length of each individual hair andthen projecting out of the hairs to form a long, white, silky mane.At that moment I had the sensation of intense convulsions, and in a matter ofinstants a tunnel formed around me, very low and narrow, hard and strangelycold. It felt to the touch like a wall of solid tinfoil. I found I was sittingon the tunnel floor.I tried to stand up, but hit my head on the metal roof, and the tunnelcompressed itself until it was suffocating me. I remember having to crawl towarda son of round point where the tunnel ended; when I finally arrived, if I did, Ihad forgotten all about the dog, don Juan, and myself. I was exhausted. Myclothes were soaked in a cold, sticky liquid. I rolled back and forth trying tofind a position in which to rest, a position where my heart would not pound sohard. In one of those shifts I saw the dog again.Every memory came back to me at once, and suddenly all was clear in my mind. Iturned around to look for don Juan, but I could not distinguish anything oranyone. All I was capable of seeing was the dog becoming iridescent; an intenselight radiated from his body. I saw again the water flowing through him,kindling him like a bonfire. I got to the water, sank my face in the pan, anddrank with him. My hands were in front of me on the ground and, as I drank, Isaw the fluid running through my veins setting up hues of red and yellow andgreen. I drank more and more. I drank until I was all afire; I was all aglow. Idrank until the fluid went out of my body through each pore and projected outlike fibres of silk, and I too acquired a long, lustrous, iridescent mane. Ilooked at the dog and his mane was like mine. A supreme happiness filled mywhole body, and we ran together toward a sort of yellow warmth that came fromsome indefinite place. And there we played. We played and wrestled until I knewhis wishes and he knew mine. We took turns manipulating each other in thefashion of a puppet show. I could make him move his legs by twisting my toes,and every time he nodded his head I felt an irresistible impulse to jump. Buthis most impish act was to make me scratch my head with my foot while I sat; hedid it by flapping his ears from side to side. This action was to me utterly,unbearably funny. Such a touch of grace and irony; such mastery, I thought. Theeuphoria that possessed me was indescribable. I laughed until it was almostimpossible to breathe.I had the clear sensation of not being able to open my eyes; I was lookingthrough a tank of water. It was a long and very painful state filled with theanxiety of not being able to wake up and yet being awake. Then slowly the worldbecame clear and in focus. My field of vision became again very round and ample,and with it came an ordinary conscious act, which was to turn around and lookfor that marvellous being. At this point I encountered the most difficulttransition. The passage from my normal state had taken place almost without myrealizing it: I was aware; my thoughts and feelings were a corollary of thatawareness; and the passing was smooth and clear. But this second change, theawakening to serious, sober consciousness, was genuinely shocking. I hadforgotten I was a man! The sadness of such an irreconcilable situation was sointense that I wept.Saturday, 5 August 1961Later that morning, after breakfast, the owner of the house, don Juan, and Idrove back to don Juan’s place. I was very tired, but I couldn’t go to sleep inthe truck. Only after the man had left did I fall asleep on the porch of donJuan’s house.When I woke up it was dark; don Juan had covered me up with a blanket, I lookedfor him, but he was not in the house. He came later with a pot of fried beansand a stack of tortillas. I was extremely hungry.After we had finished eating and were resting he asked me to tell him all thathad happened to me the night before. I related my experience in great detail andas accurately as possible.When I had finished he nodded his head and said, “I think you are fine. It isdifficult for me to explain now how and why.But I think it went all right for you. You see, sometimes he is playful, like achild; at other times he is terrible, fearsome. He either frolics, or he is deadserious. It is impossible to know beforehand what he will be like with anotherperson. Yet, when one knows him well—sometimes. You played with him tonight.You are the only person I know who has had such an encounter.”“In what way does my experience differ from that of others?”“You’re not an Indian; therefore it is hard for me to figure out what is what.Yet he either takes people or rejects them, regardless of whether they areIndians or not. That I know. I have seen numbers of them. I also know that hefrolics, he makes some people laugh, but never have I seen him play withanyone.”“Can you tell me now, don Juan, how does peyote protect . . .”He did not let me finish. Vigorously he touched me on the shoulder.“Don’t you ever name him that way. You haven’t seen enough of him yet to knowhim.”“How does Mescalito protect people?”“He advises. He answers whatever questions you ask.“Then Mescalito is real? I mean he is something you can see?”He seemed to be baffled by my question. He looked at me with a sort of blankexpression.“What I meant to say, is that Mescalito . . .”“I heard what you said. Didn’t you see him last night?I wanted to say that I saw only a dog, but I noticed his bewildered look.“Then you think what I saw last night was him?”He looked at me with contempt. He chuckled, shook his head as though he couldn’tbelieve it, and in a very belligerent tone he added, “A poco crees que eratu—mama [Don’t tell me you believe it was your—mama]?” He paused before saying“mama” because what he meant to say was “tu chingada madre”, an idiom used as adisrespectful allusion to the other party’s mother.The word “mama” was so incongruous that we both laughed for a long time.Then I realized he had fallen asleep and had not answered my question.Sunday, 6 August 1961I drove don Juan to the house where I had taken peyote. On the way he told methat the name of the man who had “offered me to Mescalito” was John. When we gotto the house we found John sitting on his porch with two young men. All of themwere extremely jovial, They laughed and talked with great ease.The three of them spoke English perfectly. I told John that I had come to thankhim for having helped me.I wanted to get their views on my behaviour during the hallucinogenicexperience, and told them I had been trying to think of what I had done thatnight and that I couldn’t remember. They laughed and were reluctant to talkabout it. They seemed to be holding back on account of don Juan. They allglanced at him as though waiting for an affirmative cue to go on. Don Juan musthave cued them, although I did not notice anything, because suddenly John beganto tell me what I had done that night.He said he knew I had been “taken” when he heard me puking.He estimated that I must have puked thirty times. Don Juan corrected him andsaid it was only ten times.John continued: “Then we all moved next to you. You were stiff, and were havingconvulsions. For a very long time, while lying on your back, you moved yourmouth as though talking.Then you began to bump your head on the floor, and don Juan put an old hat onyour head and you stopped it. You shivered and whined for hours, lying on thefloor. I think everybody fell asleep then; but I heard you puffing and groaningin my sleep.Then I heard you scream and I woke up. I saw you leaping up in the air,screaming. You made a dash for the water, knocked the pan over, and began toswim in the puddle.“Don Juan brought you more water. You sat quietly in front of the pan. Then youjumped up and took off all your clothes.You were kneeling in front of the water, drinking in big gulps.Then you just sat there and stared into space. We thought you were going to bethere forever. Nearly everybody was asleep, including don Juan, when suddenlyyou jumped up again, howling, and took after the dog. The dog got scared andhowled too, and ran to the back of the house. Then everybody woke up.“We all got up. You came back from the other side still chasing the dog. The dogwas running ahead of you barking and howling. I think you must have gone twentytimes around the house, running in circles, barking like a dog. I was afraidpeople were going to be curious. There are no neighbours close, but your howlingwas so loud it could have been heard for miles.”One of the young men added, “You caught up with the dog and brought it to theporch in your arms.”John continued: “Then you began to play with the dog. You wrestled with him, andthe dog and you bit each other and played. That, I thought, was funny. My dogdoes not play usually. But this time you and the dog were rolling on eachother.”“Then you ran to the water and the dog drank with you,” the young man said. “Youran five or six times to the water with the dog.”“How long did this go on?” I asked.“Hours,” John said. “At one time we lost sight of you two. I think you must haverun to the back. We just heard you barking and groaning. You sounded so muchlike a dog that we couldn’t tell you two apart.”“Maybe it was just the dog alone,” I said.They laughed, and John said, “You were barking there, boy!”“What happened next?”The three men looked at one another and seemed to have a hard time deciding whathappened next. Finally the young man who had not yet said anything spoke up.“He choked,” he said, looking at John.“Yes, you certainly choked. You began to cry very strangely, and then you fellto the floor. We thought you were biting your tongue; don Juan opened your jawsand poured water on your face. Then you started shivering and having convulsionsall over again. Then you stayed motionless for a long time. Don Juan said it wasall over. By then it was morning, so we covered you with a blanket and left youto sleep on the porch.”He stopped there and looked at the other men who were obviously trying not tolaugh. He turned to don Juan and asked him something. Don Juan smiled andanswered the question.John turned to me and said, “We left you here on the porch because we wereafraid you were going to piss all over the rooms.”They all laughed very loudly.“What was the matter with me?” I asked. “Did I . . .”“Did you?” John son of mimicked me. “We were not going to mention it, but donJuan says it is all right. You pissed all over my dog!”“What did I do?”“You don’t think the dog was running because he was afraid of you, do you? Thedog was running because you were pissing on him.”There was general laughter at this point. I tried to question one of the youngmen, but they were all laughing and he didn’t hear me.John went on: “My dog got even though; he pissed on you too!”This statement was apparently utterly funny because they all roared withlaughter, including don Juan. When they had quieted down, I asked in allearnestness, “Is it really true? This really happened?”Still laughing, John replied: “I swear my dog really pissed on you.”Driving back to don Juan’s place I asked him: “Did all that really happen, donJuan?”“Yes,” he said, “but they don’t know what you saw. They don’t realize you wereplaying with «him». That is why I did not disturb you.”“But is this business of the dog and me pissing on each other true?”“It was not a dog! How many times do I have to tell you that?This is the only way to understand it. It’s the only way! It was «he» who playedwith you.”“Did you know all this was happening before I told you about it?”He vacillated for an instant before answering.“No, I remembered, after you told me about it, the strange way you looked. Ijust suspected you were doing fine because you didn’t seem scared.”“Did the dog really play with me as they say?”“Goddammit! It was not a dog!”Thursday, 17 August 1969I told don Juan how I felt about my experience. From the point of view of myintended work it had been a disastrous event. I said I did not care for anothersimilar “encounter” with Mescalito. I agreed that everything that had happenedto me had been more than interesting, but added that nothing in it could reallymove me towards seeking it again. I seriously believed that I was notconstructed for that type of endeavour. Peyote had produced in me, as apost-reaction, a strange kind of physical discomfort.It was an indefinite fear or unhappiness; a melancholy of some sort, which Icould not define exactly. And I did not find that state noble in any way.Don Juan laughed and said, “You are beginning to learn.”“This type of learning is not for me. I am not made for it, don Juan.”“You always exaggerate.”“This is not exaggeration.”“It is. The only trouble is that you exaggerate the bad points only.”“There are no good points so far as I am concerned. All I know is that it makesme afraid.”“There is nothing wrong with being afraid. When you fear, you see things in adifferent way.”“But I don’t care about seeing things in a different way, don Juan. I think I amgoing to leave the learning about Mescalito alone. I can’t handle it, don Juan.This is really a bad situation for me.”“Of course it is bad—even for me. You are not the only one who is baffled.”“Why should you be baffled, don Juan?”“I have been thinking about what I saw the other night.Mescalito actually played with you. That baffled me, because it was anindication [omen].”“What kind of—indication, don Juan?”“Mescalito was pointing you out to me.”“What for?”“It wasn’t clear to me then, but now it is. He meant you were the «chosen man»[escogido]. Mescalito pointed you out to me and by doing that he told me youwere the chosen man.”“Do you mean I was chosen among others for some task, or something of the sort?”“No. What I mean is, Mescalito told me you could be the man I am looking for.”“When did he tell you that, don Juan?”“By playing with you, he told me that. This makes you the chosen man for me.”“What does it mean to be the chosen man?”“There are some secrets I know [Tengosecretos]. I have secrets I won’t be ableto reveal to anyone unless I find my chosen man. The other night when I saw youplaying with Mescalito it was clear to me you were that man. But you are not anIndian.How baffling!”“But what does it mean to me, don Juan? What do I have to do?”“I’ve made up my mind and I am going to teach you the secrets that make up thelot of a man of knowledge.”“Do you mean the secrets about Mescalito?”“Yes, but those are not all the secrets I know. There are others, of a differentkind, which I would like to give to someone. I had a teacher myself, mybenefactor, and I also became his chosen man upon performing a certain feat. Hetaught me all I know.”I asked him again what this new role would require of me; he said learning wasthe only thing involved, learning in the sense of what I had experienced in thetwo sessions with him.The way in which the situation had evolved was quite strange.I had made up my mind to tell him I was going to give up the idea of learningabout peyote, and then before I could really make my point, he offered to teachme his “knowledge”. I did not know what he meant by that, but I felt that thissudden turn was very serious. I argued I had no qualifications for such a task,as it required a rare kind of courage which I did not have. I told him that mybent of character was to talk about acts others performed. I wanted to hear hisviews and opinions about everything. I told him I could be happy if I could sitthere and listen to him talk for days. To me, that would be learning.He listened without interrupting me. I talked for a long time.Then he said:“All this is very easy to understand. Fear is the first natural enemy a man mustovercome on his path to knowledge. Besides, you are curious. That evens up thescore. And you will learn in spite of yourself; that’s the rule.”I protested for a while longer, trying to dissuade him. But he seemed to beconvinced there was nothing else I could do but learn.“You are not thinking in the proper order,” he said. “Mescalito actually playedwith you. That’s the point to think about.Why don’t you dwell on that instead of on your fear?”“Was it so unusual?”“You are the only person I have ever seen playing with him.You are not used to this kind of life; therefore the indications[omens] bypass you. Yet you are a serious person, but your seriousness isattached to what you do, not to what goes on outside you. You dwell uponyourself too much. That’s the trouble. And that produces a terrible fatigue.”“But what else can anyone do, don Juan?“Seek and see the marvels all around you. You will get tired of looking atyourself alone, and that fatigue will make you deaf and blind to everythingelse.”“You have a point, don Juan, but how can I change?”“Think about the wonder of Mescalito playing with you.Think about nothing else: The rest will come to you of itself.”Sunday, 20 August 1961Last night don Juan proceeded to usher me into the realm of his knowledge. Wesat in front of his house in the dark. Suddenly, after a long silence, he beganto talk. He said he was going to advise me with the same words his ownbenefactor had used the first day he took him as his apprentice. Don Juan hadapparently memorized the words, for he repeated them several times, to make sureI did not miss any:“A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war, wide-awake, with fear, with respect,and with absolute assurance. Going to knowledge or going to war in any othermanner is a mistake, and whoever makes it will live to regret his steps.”I asked him why was it so and he said that when a man has fulfilled those fourrequisites there are no mistakes for which he will have to account; under suchconditions his acts lose the blundering quality of a fool’s acts. If such a manfails, or suffers a defeat, he will have lost only a battle, and there will beno pitiful regrets over that.Then he said he intended to teach me about an “ally” in the very same way hisown benefactor had taught him. He put strong emphasis on the words “very sameway”, repeating the phrase several times.An “ally”, he said, is a power a man can bring into his life to help him, advisehim, and give him the strength necessary to perform acts, whether big or small,right or wrong. This ally is necessary to enhance a man’s life, guide his acts,and further his knowledge. In fact, an ally is the indispensable aid to knowing.Don Juan said this with great conviction and force. He seemed to choose hiswords carefully. He repeated the following sentence four times:“An ally will make you see and understand things about which no human beingcould possibly enlighten you.”“Is an ally something like a guardian spirit?”“It is neither a guardian nor a spirit. It is an aid.”“Is Mescalito your ally?”“No! Mescalito is another kind of power. A unique power!A protector, a teacher.”“ What makes Mescalito different from an ally?”“He can’t be tamed and used as an ally is tamed and used.Mescalito is outside oneself. He chooses to show himself in many forms towhoever stands in front of him, regardless of whether that person is a brujo ora farm boy.”Don Juan spoke with deep fervour about Mescalito’s being the teacher of theproper way to live. I asked him how Mescalito taught the “proper way of life”,and don Juan replied that Mescalito showed how to live.“How does he show it?” I asked.“He has many ways of showing it. Sometimes he shows it on his hand, or on therocks, or the trees, or just in front of you.”“Is it like a picture in front of you?”“No. It is a teaching in front of you.”“Does Mescalito talk to the person?”“Yes. But not in words.”“How does he talk, then?”“He talks differently to every man.”I felt my questions were annoying him. I did not ask any more. He went onexplaining that there were no exact steps to knowing Mescalito; therefore no onecould teach about him except Mescalito himself. This quality made him a uniquepower; he was not the same for every man.On the other hand, the acquiring of an ally required, don Juan said, the mostprecise teaching and the following of stages or steps without a singledeviation. There are many such ally powers in the world, he said, but he wasfamiliar with only two of them.And he was going to lead me to them and their secrets, but it was up to me tochoose one of them, for I could have only one.His benefactor’s ally was in la yerba del diablo (devil’s weed), he said, but hepersonally did not like it, even though his benefactor had taught him itssecrets. His own ally was in the humito (the little smoke), he said, but he didnot elaborate on the nature of the smoke.I asked him about it. He remained quiet. After a long pause I asked him:“What kind of a power is an ally?”“It is an aid. I have already told you.”“How does it aid?”“An ally is a power capable of carrying a man beyond the boundaries of himself.This is how an ally can reveal matters no human being could.”“But Mescalito also takes you out of the boundaries of yourself. Doesn’t thatmake him an ally?”“No. Mescalito takes you out of yourself to teach you. An ally takes you out togive you power.”I asked him to explain this point to me in more detail, or to describe thedifference in effect between the two. He looked at me for a long time andlaughed. He said that learning through conversation was not only a waste, butstupidity, because learning was the most difficult task a man could undertake.He asked me to remember the time I had tried to find my spot, and how I wantedto find it without doing any work because I had expected him to hand out all theinformation. If he had done so, he said, I would never have learned. But,knowing how difficult it was to find my spot, and, above all, knowing that itexisted, would give me a unique sense of confidence. He said that while Iremained rooted to my “good spot” nothing could cause me bodily harm, because Ihad the assurance that at that particular spot I was at my very best. I had thepower to shove off anything that might be harmful to me. If, however, he hadtold me where it was, I would never have had the confidence needed to claim itas true knowledge. Thus, knowledge was indeed power.Don Juan said then that every time a man sets himself to learn he has to labouras hard as I did to find that spot, and the limits of his learning aredetermined by his own nature. Thus he saw no point in talking about knowledge.He said that certain kinds of knowledge were too powerful for the strength Ihad, and to talk about them would only bring harm to me. He apparently feltthere was nothing else he wanted to say. He got up and walked towards his house.I told him the situation overwhelmed me. It was not what I had conceived orwanted it to be.He said that fears are natural; that all of us experience them and there isnothing we can do about it. But on the other hand, no matter how frighteninglearning is, it is more terrible to think of a man without an ally, or withoutknowledge.3In the more than two years that elapsed between the time don Juan decided toteach me about the ally powers and the time he thought I was ready to learnabout them in the pragmatic, participatory form he considered as learning, hegradually defined the general features of the two allies in question. Heprepared me for the indispensable corollary of all the verbalizations, and theconsolidation of all the teachings, the states of non-ordinary reality.At first he talked about the ally powers in a very casual manner. The firstreferences I have in my notes are interjected between other topics ofconversation.Wednesday, 23 August 1961“The devil’s weed [Jimson weed] was my benefactor’s ally. It could have beenmine also, but I didn’t like her.”“Why didn’t you like the devil’s weed, don Juan?”“She has a serious drawback.”“Is she inferior to other ally powers?”“No. Don’t get me wrong. She is as powerful as the best of allies, but there issomething about her which I personally don’t like.”“Can you tell me what it is?”“She distorts men. She gives them a taste of power too soon without fortifyingtheir hearts and makes them domineering and unpredictable. She makes them weakin the middle of their great power.”“Isn’t there any way to avoid that?”“There is a way to overcome it, but not to avoid it. Whoever becomes the weed’sally must pay that price.”“How can one overcome that effect, don Juan?”“The devil’s weed has four heads: the root, the stem and leaves, the flowers,and the seeds. Each one of them is different, and whoever becomes her ally mustlearn about them in that order. The most important head is in the roots. Thepower of the devil’s weed is conquered through the roots. The stem and leavesare the head that cures maladies; properly used, this head is a gift to mankind.The third head is in the flowers, and it is used to turn people crazy, or tomake them obedient, or to kill them. The man whose ally is the weed neverintakes the flowers, nor does he intake the stem and leaves, for that matter,except in cases of his own illness; but the roots and the seeds are alwaysintaken; especially the seeds; they are the fourth head of the devil’s weed andthe most powerful of the four.“My benefactor used to say the seeds are the «sober head» the only part thatcould fortify the heart of man. The devil’s weed is hard with her proteges, heused to say, because she aims to kill them fast, a thing she ordinarilyaccomplishes before they can arrive at the secrets of the «sober head». Thereare, however, tales about men who have unravelled the secrets of the sober head.What a challenge for a man of knowledge!”“Did your benefactor unravel such secrets?”“No, he didn’t.”“Have you met anyone who has done it?”“No. But they lived at a time when that knowledge was important.”“Do you know anyone who has met such men?”“No, I don’t.”“Did your benefactor know anyone?”“He did.”“Why didn’t he arrive at the secrets of the sober head?”“To tame the devil’s weed into an ally is one of the most difficult tasks Iknow. She never became one with me, for example, perhaps because I was neverfond of her.”“Can you still use her as an ally in spite of not being fond of her?”“I can; nevertheless, I prefer not to. Maybe it will be different for you.”“Why is it called the devil’s weed?”Don Juan made a gesture of indifference, shrugged his shoulders, and remainedquiet for some time. Finally he said that “devil’s weed” was her temporary name[su nombre de leche].He also said there were other names for the devil’s weed, but they were not tobe used, because the calling of a name was a serious matter, especially if onewas learning to tame an ally power. I asked him why the calling of a name was soserious a matter. He said names were reserved to be used only when one wascalling for help, in moments of great stress and need, and he assured me thatsuch moments happen sooner or later in the life of whoever seeks knowledge.Sunday, 3 September 1961Today, during the afternoon, don Juan collected two Datura plants from thefield.Quite unexpectedly he brought the subject of the devil’s weed into ourconversation, and then asked me to go with him to the hills and look for one.We drove to the nearby mountains. I got a shovel out of the trunk and walkedinto one of the canyons. We walked for quite a while, wading through thechaparral, which grew thick in the soft, sandy dirt. He stopped next to a smallplant with darkgreen leaves, and big, whitish, bell-shaped flowers.“This one,” he said.Immediately he started to shovel. I tried to help him but he refused with astrong shake of the head, and went on to dig a circular hole around the plant: ahole shaped like a cone, deep toward the outer edge and sloping into a mound inthe centre of the circle. When he stopped digging he knelt close to the stem andwith his fingers cleared the soft dirt around it, uncovering about four inchesof a big, tuberous, forked root whose width contrasted markedly with the widthof the stem, which was frail in comparison.Don Juan looked at me and said the plant was a “male” because the root forkedout from the exact point where it joined the stem. Then he stood up and startedto walk away, looking for something.“What are you looking for, don Juan?”“I want to find a stick.”I began to look around, hut he stopped me.“Not you! You sit over there.” He pointed to some rocks twenty feet away. “Iwill find it.”He came back after a while with a long, dry branch. Using it as a digging stick,he loosened the dirt carefully along the two diverging branches of the root. Hecleaned around them to a depth of approximately two feet. As he dug deeper thedirt became so hard-packed that it was practically impossible to penetrate itwith the stick.He came to a halt and sat down to catch his breath. I sat next to him. We didnot talk for a long time.“Why don’t you dig it out with the shovel?” I asked.“It could cut and injure the plant. I had to get a stick that belonged to thisarea so that, if I had struck the root, the injury wouldn’t have bean as bad asone caused by a shovel or a foreign object.”“What kind of a stick did you get?”“Any dry branch of the paloverde tree would do. If there are no dry branches youhave to cut a fresh one.”“Can you use the branches of any other tree?”“I told you, only paloverde and not any other.”“Why is that so, don Juan?”“Because the devil’s weed has very few friends, and paloverde is the only treein this area which agrees with her—the only thing that grabs or hooks onto it[lo unico que prende]. If you damage the root with a shovel she will not growfor you when you replant her, but if you injure her with such a stick, chancesare the plant will not even feel it.”“What are you going to do with the root now?“I’m going to cut it. You must leave me. Go find another plant and wait until Icall you.”“Don’t you want me to help you?”“You may help me only if I ask you!”I walked away and started to look for another plant in order to fight the strongdesire to sneak around and watch him. After some time he joined me.“Let us look for the female now,” he said.“How do you tell them apart?”“The female is taller and grows above the ground so it really looks like a smalltree. The male is large and spreads out near the ground and looks more like athick bush. Once we dig the female out you will see it has a single root goingfor quite a way before it becomes a fork. The male, on the other hand, has aforked root joined to the stem.”We looked together through the field of daturas. Then, pointing to a plant, hesaid, “That’s a female.” And he proceeded to dig it out as he had done theother. As soon as he had cleared the root I was able to see that the rootconformed to his prediction.I left him again when he was about to cut it.When we got to his house he opened the bundle in which he had put the Daturaplants. He took the larger one, the male, first and washed it in a big metaltray. Very carefully he scrubbed all the dirt from the root, stem, and leaves.After that meticulous cleaning, he severed the stem from the root by making asuperficial incision around the width of their juncture with a short, serratedknife and by cracking them apart. He took the stem and separated every part ofit by making individual heaps with leaves, flowers, and the prickly seedpods. Hethrew away everything that was dry or had been spoiled by worms, and kept onlythose parts that were complete. He tied together the two branches of the rootwith two pieces of string, cracked them in half after making a superficial cutat the joint, and got two pieces of root of equal size.He then took a piece of rough burlap cloth and placed in it first the two piecesof root tied together; on top of them he put the leaves in a neat bunch, thenthe flowers, the seedpods, and the stem. He folded the burlap and made a knotwith the corners.He repeated exactly the same steps with the other plant, the female, except thatwhen he got to the root, instead of cutting it, he left the fork intact, like anupside-down letter Y. Then he placed all the parts in another cloth bundle. Whenhe finished, it was already dark.Wednesday, 6 September 1961Today, late in the afternoon, we returned to the topic of the devil’s weed.“I think we should start with that weed again,” don Juan said suddenly.After a polite silence I asked him, “What are you going to do with the plants?”“The plants I dug out and cut are mine,” he said. “It is as though they weremyself; with them I’m going to teach you the way to tame the devil’s weed.”“How will you do that?”“The devil’s weed is divided into portions [partes]. Each one of these portionsis different; each has its unique purpose and service.”He opened his left hand and measured on the floor from the tip of his thumb tothe tip of his fourth finger.“This is my portion. You will measure yours with your own hand. Now, toestablish dominion over the devil’s weed, you must begin by taking the firstportion of the root. But since I have brought you to her, you must take thefirst portion of the root of my plant. I have measured it for you, so it isreally my portion that you must take at the beginning.”He went inside the house and brought out one of the burlap bundles. He sat downand opened it. I noticed it was the male plant. I also noticed there was onlyone piece of root. He took the piece that was left from the original set of twoand held it in front of my face.“This is your first portion,” he said. “I give it to you. I have cut it myselffor you. I have measured it as my own; now I give it to you.”For an instant, the thought that I would have to chew it like a carrot crossedmy mind, but he placed it inside a small, white, cotton bag.He walked to the back of the house. He sat there on the floor with his legscrossed, and with a round mano began to mash the root inside the bag. He workedit over a flat slab which served as a mortar. From time to time he washed thetwo stones, and kept the water in a small, flat, wooden dugout basin.As he pounded he sang an unintelligible chant, very softly and monotonously.When he had mashed the root into a soft pulp inside the bag, he placed it in thewooden basin. He again placed the slab mortar and the pestle into the basin,filled it with water, and then carried it to a sort of rectangular pig’s troughset against the back fence.He said the root had to soak all night, and had to be left outside the house soit would catch the night air (el sereno). “If tomorrow is a sunny, hot day, itwill be an excellent omen,” he said.Sunday, 10 September 1961Thursday, 7 September was a very clear and hot day. Don Juan seemed very pleasedwith the good omen and repeated several tunes that the devil’s weed had probablyliked me. The root had soaked all night, and about 10:00 a.m. we walked to theback of the house. He took the basin out of the trough, placed it on the ground,and sat next to it. He took the bag and rubbed it on the bottom of the basin. Heheld it a few inches above the water and squeezed its contents, then dropped thebag into the water.He repeated the same sequence three more times, then discarded the bag, tossingit into the trough, and left the basin in the hot sun.We came back to it two hours later. He brought with him a medium-size kettlewith boiling, yellowish water. He tipped the basin very carefully and emptiedthe top water, preserving the thick silt that had accumulated on the bottom. Hepoured the boiling water on the silt and left the basin in the sun again.This sequence was repeated three times at intervals of more than an hour.Finally he poured out most of the water from the basin, tipped it to an angle tocatch the late afternoon sun, and left it.When we returned hours later, it was dark. On the bottom of the basin there wasa layer of gummy substance. It resembled a batch of half-cooked starch, whitishor light grey. There was perhaps a full teaspoon of it. He took the basin insidethe house, and while he put some water on to boil. I picked out pieces of dirtthe wind had blown into the silt. He laughed at me.“That little dirt won’t hurt anybody.”When the water was boiling he poured about a cup of it into the basin. It wasthe same yellowish water he had used before.It dissolved the silt, making a sort of milky substance.“What kind of water is that, don Juan?”“Water of fruits and flowers from the canyon.”He emptied the contents of the basin into an old clay mug that looked like aflowerpot. It was still very hot, so he blew on to it to cool it. He took a sipand handed me the mug.“Drink now!” he said.I took it automatically, and without deliberation drank all the water. It tastedsomewhat bitter, although the bitterness was hardly noticeable. What was veryoutstanding was the pungent odour of the water. It smelled like cockroaches.Almost immediately I began to sweat. I got very warm, and blood rushed to myears. I saw a red spot in front of my eyes, and the muscles of my stomach beganto contract in painful cramps. After a while, even though I felt no more pain, Ibegan to get cold and perspiration literally soaked me.Don Juan asked me if I saw blackness or black spots in front of my eyes. I toldhim I was seeing everything in red.My teeth were chattering because of an uncontrollable nervousness that came tome in waves, as if radiating out from the middle of my chest.Then he asked me if I was afraid. His questions seemed meaningless to me. I toldhim that I was obviously afraid, but he asked me again if I was afraid of her. Idid not understand what he meant and I said yes. He laughed and said that I wasnot really afraid. He asked if I still saw red. All I was seeing was a huge redspot in front of my eyes.I felt better after a while. Gradually the nervous spasms disappeared, leavingonly an aching, pleasant tiredness and an intense desire to sleep. I couldn’tkeep my eyes open, although I could still hear don Juan’s voice. I fell asleep.But the sensation of my being submerged in a deep red persisted a11 night. Ieven had dreams in red.I woke up on Saturday about 3:00 p.m. I had slept almost two days. I had a mildheadache and an upset stomach, and very sharp, intermittent pains in myintestines. Except for that, everything else was like an ordinary waking. Ifound don Juan sitting in front of his house dozing. He smiled at me.“Everything went fine the other night,” he said. “You saw red and that’s allthat is important.”“What would have happened if I had not seen red?”“You would have seen black, and that is a bad sign.”“Why is it bad?”“When a man sees black it means he is not made for the devil’s weed, and hevomits his entrails out, all green and black.”“Would he die?”“I don’t think anyone would die, but he would be sick for a long time.”“What happens to those who see red?”“They do not vomit, and the root gives them an effect of pleasure, which meansthey are strong and of violent nature something that the weed likes. That is theway she entices. The only bad point is that men end up as slaves to the devil’sweed in return for the power she gives them. But those are matters over which wehave no control. Man lives only to learn. And if he learns it is because that isthe nature of his lot, for good or bad.”“What shall I do next, don Juan?”“Next you must plant a shoot [brote] that I have cut from the other half of thefirst portion of root. You took half of it the other night, and now the otherhalf must be put into the ground. It has to grow and seed before you canundertake the real task of taming the plant.”“How will I tame her?”“The devil’s weed is tamed through the root. Step by step,you must learn thesecrets of each portion of the root. You must intake them in order to learn thesecrets and conquer the power.”“Are the different portions prepared in the same way you did the first one?”“No, each portion is different.”“What are the specific effects of each portion?”“I already said, each teaches a different form of power. What you took the othernight is nothing yet. Anyone can do that.But only the brujo can take the deeper portions. I can’t tell you what they dobecause I don’t know yet whether she will take you. We must wait.”“When will you tell me, then?”“Whenever your plant has grown and seeded.”“If the first portion can be taken by anyone, what is it used for?”“In a diluted form it is good for all the matters of manhood, old people whohave lost their vigour, or young men who are seeking adventures, or even womenwho want passion.”“You said the root is used for power only, but I see it’s used for other mattersbesides power. Am I correct?”He looked at me for a very long time, with a steadfast gaze that embarrassed me.I felt my question had made him angry, but I couldn’t understand why.“The weed is used only for power,” he finally said in a dry, stern tone. “Theman who wants his vigour back, the young people who seek to endure fatigue andhunger, the man who wants to kill another man, a woman who wants to be in heatthey all desire power. And the weed will give it to them! Do you feel you likeher?” he asked after a pause.“I feel a strange vigour,” I said, and it was true. I had noticed it onawakening and I felt it then. It was a very peculiar sensation of discomfort, orfrustration; my whole body moved and stretched with unusual lightness andstrength. My arms and legs itched. My shoulders seemed to swell; the muscles ofmy back and neck made me feel like pushing, or rubbing, against trees. I felt Icould demolish a wall by ramming it.We did not speak any more. We sat on the porch for a while, I noticed that donJuan was falling asleep; he nodded a couple of times, then he simply stretchedhis legs, lay on the door with his hands behind his head, and went to sleep. Igot up and went to the back of the house where I burned up my extra physicalenergy by clearing away the debris; I remembered his mentioning that he wouldlike me to help him clean up at the back of his house.Later, when he woke up and came to the back, I was more relaxed.We sat down to eat, and in the course of the meal he asked me three times how Ifelt. Since this was a rarity I finally asked,“Why do you worry about how I feel, don Juan? Do you expect me to have a badreaction from drinking the juice?”He laughed. I thought he was acting like a mischievous boy who has set up aprank and checks from time to time for the results. Still laughing, he said:“You don’t look sick. A while ago you even talked rough to me.”“I did not, don Juan,” I protested. “I don’t ever recall talking to you likethat.” I was very serious on that point because I did not remember that I hadever felt annoyed with him.“You came out in her defence,” he said.“In whose defence?”“You were defending the devil’s weed. You sounded like a lover already.”I was going to protest even more vigorously about it, but I stopped myself.“I really did not realize I was defending her.”“Of course you did not. You don’t even remember what you said, do you?”“No, I don’t. I must admit it.”“You see. The devil’s weed is like that. She sneaks up on you like a woman. Youare not even aware of it. All you care about is that she makes you feel good andpowerful: the muscles swelling with vigour, the fists itching, the soles of thefeet burning to run somebody down. When a man knows her he really becomes fullof cravings. My benefactor used to say that the devil’s weed keeps men who wantpower, and gets rid of those who can’t handle it. But power was more commonthen; it was sought more avidly. My benefactor was a powerful man, and accordingto what he told me, his benefactor, in turn, was even more given to the pursuitof power. But in those days there was good reason to be powerful.”“Do you think there is no reason for power nowadays?”“Power is all right for you now. You are young. You are not an Indian. Perhapsthe devil’s weed would be in good hands.You seem to have liked it. It made you feel strong. I felt all that myself. Andyet I didn’t like it.”“Can you tell me why, don Juan?”“I don’t like its power! There is no use for it any more. In other times, likethose my benefactor told me about, there was reason to seek power. Men performedphenomenal deeds, were admired for their strength and feared and respected fortheir knowledge. My benefactor told me stories of truly phenomenal deeds thatwere performed long, long ago. But now we, the Indians, do not seek that powerany more. Nowadays, the Indians use the weed to rub themselves. They use theleaves and flowers for other matters; they even say it cures their boils. Butthey do not seek its power, a power that acts like a magnet, more potent andmore dangerous to handle as the root goes deeper into the ground. When onearrives to a depth of four yards—and they say some people have—one finds theseat of permanent power, power without end. Very few humans have done this inthe past, and nobody has done it today. I’m telling you, the power of thedevil’s weed is no longer needed by us, the Indians. Little by little, I thinkwe have lost interest, and now power does not matter any more. I myself do notseek it, and yet at one time, when I was your age, I too felt its swellinginside me. I felt the way you did today, only five hundred times more strongly.I killed a man with a single blow of my arm. I could toss boulders, hugeboulders not even twenty men could budge. Once I jumped so high I chopped thetop leaves off the highest trees. But it was all for nothing! All I did wasfrighten the Indians—only the Indians. The rest who knew nothing about it didnot believe it.They saw either a crazy Indian, or something moving at the top of the trees.”We were silent for a long time. I needed to say something.“It was different when there were people in the world,” he proceeded, “peoplewho knew a man could become a mountain lion, or a bird, or that a man couldsimply fly. So I don’t use the devil’s weed any more. For what? To frighten theIndians?[¿Para que? ¿Para asustar a los indios?]”And I saw him sad, and a deep empathy filled me. I wanted to say something tohim, even if it was a platitude.“Perhaps, don Juan, that is the fate of all men who want to know.”“Perhaps,” he said quietly.Thursday, 23 November 1961I didn’t see don Juan sitting on his porch as I drove in. I thought it wasstrange. I called to him out loud and his daughter-in-law came out of the house.“He’s inside,” she said.I found he had dislocated his ankle several weeks before. He had made his owncast by soaking strips of cloth in a mush made with cactus and powdered bone.The strips, wrapped tightly around his ankle, had dried into a light,streamlined cast. It had the hardness of plaster, but not its bulkiness.“How did it happen?” I asked.His daughter-in-law, a Mexican woman from Yucatan, who was tending him, answeredme.“It was an accident! He fell and nearly broke his foot!”Don Juan laughed and waited until the woman had left the house before answering.“Accident, my eye! I have an enemy nearby. A woman. «La Catalina!» She pushed meduring a moment of weakness and I fell.”“Why did she do that?”“She wanted to kill me, that’s why.”“Was she here with you?”“Yes!”“Why did you let her in?”“I didn’t. She flew in.”“I beg your pardon!”“She is a blackbird [chanate]. And so effective at that. I was caught bysurprise. She has been trying to finish me off for a long while. This time shegot real close.”“Did you say she is a blackbird? I mean, is she a bird?”“There you go again with your questions. She is a blackbird!The same way I’m a crow. Am I a man or a bird? I’m a man who knows how to becomea bird. But going back to «la Catalina»,she is a fiendish witch! Her intent to kill me is so strong that I can hardlyfight her off. The blackbird came all the way into my house and I couldn’t stopit.”“Can you become a bird, don Juan?”“Yes! But that’s something we’ll take up later.”“Why does she want to kill you?”“Oh, there’s an old problem between us. It got out of hand and now it looks asif I will have to finish her off before she finishes me.”“Are you going to use witchcraft?” I asked with great expectations.“Don’t be silly. No witchcraft would ever work on her. I have other plans! I’lltell you about them some day.”“Can your ally protect you from her?”“No! The little smoke only tells me what to do. Then I must protect myself.”“How about Mescalito? Can he protect you from her?”“No! Mescalito is a teacher, not a power to be used for personal reasons.”“How about the devil’s weed?”“I’ve already said that I must protect myself, following the directions of myally the smoke. And as far as I know, the smoke can do anything. If you want toknow about any point in question, the smoke will tell you. And it will give younot only knowledge, but also the means to proceed. It’s the most marvellous allya man could have.”“Is the smoke the best possible ally for everybody?”“It’s not the same for everybody. Many fear it and won’t touch it, or even getclose to it. The smoke is like everything else; it wasn’t made for all of us.”“What kind of smoke is it, don Juan?”“The smoke of diviners!”There was a noticeable reverence in his voice—a mood I had never detectedbefore.“I will begin by telling you exactly what my benefactor said to me when he beganto teach me about it. Although at that time, like yourself now, I couldn’tpossibly have understood. «The devil’s weed is for those who bid for power. Thesmoke is for those who want to watch and see.» And in my opinion, the smoke ispeerless. Once a man enters into its field, every other power is at his command.It’s magnificent! Of course, it takes a lifetime.It takes years alone to become acquainted with its two vital parts: the pipe andthe smoke mixture. The pipe was given to me by my benefactor, and after so manyyears of fondling it, it has become mine. It has grown into my hands. To turn itover to your hands, for instance, will be a real task for me, and a greataccomplishment for you—if we succeed! The pipe will feel the strain of beinghandled by someone else; and if one of us makes a mistake there won’t be any wayto prevent the pipe from bursting open by its own force, or escaping from ourhands to shatter, even if it falls on a pile of straw. If that ever happens, itwould mean the end of us both. Particularly of me. The smoke would turn againstme in unbelievable ways.”“How could it turn against you if it’s your ally?”My question seemed to have altered his flow of thoughts. He didn’t speak for along time.“The difficulty of the ingredients,” he proceeded suddenly,“makes the smoke mixture one of the most dangerous substances I know. No one canprepare it without being coached. It is deadly poisonous to anyone except thesmoke’s protege! Pipe and mixture ought to be treated with intimate care. Andthe man attempting to learn must prepare himself by leading a hard, quiet life.Its effects are so dreadful that only a very strong man can stand the smallestpuff. Everything is terrifying and confusing at the outset, but every new puffmakes things more precise. And suddenly the world opens up anew! Unimaginable!When this happens the smoke has become one’s ally and will resolve any questionby allowing one to enter into inconceivable worlds.“This is the smoke’s greatest property, its greatest gift. And it performs itsfunction without hurting in the least. I call the smoke a true ally!”As usual, we were sitting in front of his house, where the dirt floor is alwaysclean and packed hard; he suddenly got up and went inside the house. After a fewmoments he returned with a narrow bundle and sat down again.“This is my pipe,” he said.He leaned over towards me and showed me a pipe he drew out of a sheath made ofgreen canvas. It was perhaps nine or ten inches long. The stem was made ofreddish wood; it was plain, without ornamentation. The bowl also seemed to bemade of wood; but it was rather bulky in comparison with the thin stem.It had a sleek finish and was dark grey, almost charcoal.He held the pipe in front of my face. I thought he was handing it over to me. Istretched out my hand to take it, but he quickly drew it back.“This pipe was given to me by my benefactor,” he said. “In turn I will pass iton to you. But first you must get to know it.Every time you come here I will give it to you. Begin by touching it. Hold itvery briefly, at first, until you and the pipe get used to each other. Then putit in your pocket, or perhaps inside your shirt. And finally put it to yourmouth. All this should be done little by little in a slow, careful way. When thebond has been established [la amistad esta hecha] you will smoke from it. If youfollow my advice and don’t rush, the smoke may become your preferred ally too.”He handed me the pipe, but without letting go of it. I stretched my right armtowards it.“With both hands,” he said.I touched the pipe with both hands for a very brief moment.He did not extend it to me all the way so that I could grasp it, but only farenough for me to touch it. Then he pulled it back.“The first step is to like the pipe. That takes time!”“Can the pipe dislike me?”“No. The pipe cannot dislike you, but you must learn to like it so that when thetime of smoking comes for you, the pipe will help you to be unafraid.”“What do you smoke, don Juan?”“This!”He opened his collar and exposed to view a small bag he kept under his shirt,which hung from his neck like a medallion. He brought it out, untied it, andvery carefully poured some of its contents into the palm of his hand.As far as I could tell, the mixture looked like finely shredded tea leaves,varying in colour from dark brown to light green, with a few specks of brightyellow.He returned the mixture to the bag, closed the bag, tied it with a leatherstring, and put it under his shirt again.“What kind of mixture is it?”“There are lots of things in it. To get all the ingredients is a very difficultundertaking. One must travel afar. The little mushrooms [loshonguitos] needed toprepare the mixture grow only at certain times of the year, and only in certainplaces.”“Do you have a different mixture for each type of aid you need?”“No! There is only one smoke, and there is no other like it.”He pointed to the bag hanging against his chest, and lifted the pipe which wasresting between his legs.“These two are one! One cannot go without the other. This pipe and the secret ofthis mixture belonged to my benefactor.They were handed down to him in the same way my benefactor gave them to me. Themixture, although difficult to prepare, is replenishable. Its secret lies in itsingredients, and in the way they are treated and mixed. The pipe, on the otherhand, is a lifetime affair. It must be looked after with infinite care. It ishardy and strong, but it should never be struck or knocked about. It should behandled with dry hands, never when the hands are sweaty, and should be used onlywhen one is alone. And no one, absolutely no one, should ever see it, unless youmean to give it to somebody. That is what my benefactor taught me, and that isthe way I have dealt with the pipe all my life.”“What would happen if you should lose or break the pipe?”He shook his head, very slowly, and looked at me.“I would die!”“Are all the sorcerers” pipes like yours?”“Not all of them have pipes like mine. But I know some men who do.”“Can you yourself make a pipe like this one, don Juan?” I insisted. “Suppose youdid not have it, how could you give me one if you wanted to do so?”“If I didn’t have the pipe, I could not, nor would I, want to give one. I wouldgive you something else instead.”He seemed to be somehow cross at me. He placed his pipe very carefully insidethe sheath, which must have been lined with a soft material because the pipe,which fitted tightly, slid in very smoothly. He went inside the house to put hispipe away.“Are you angry at me, don Juan?” I asked when he returned.He seemed surprised at my question.“No! I’m never angry at anybody! No human being can do anything important enoughfor that. You get angry at people when you feel that their acts are important. Idon’t feel that way any longer.”Tuesday, 26 December 1961The specific time to replant the “shoot”, as don Juan called the root, was notset, although it was supposed to be the next step in taming the plant-power.I arrived at don Juan’s house on Saturday, 23 December, early in the afternoon.We sat in silence for some time, as usual. The day was warm and cloudy. It hadbeen months since he had given me the first portion.“It is time to return the weed to the earth,” he said suddenly.“But first I am going to fix a protection for you. You will keep it and guardit, and it is for you alone to see. Since I am going to fix it I will also seeit. That is not good, because, as I told you, I am not fond of the devil’s weed.We are not one. But my memory74 The Teachings will not live long; I am too old. You must keep it from theeyes of others, however, for so long as their memory of having seen it lasts,the power of the protection is harmed.”He went into his room and pulled three burlap bundles out from under an oldstraw mat. He came back to the porch and sat down.After a long silence he opened one bundle. It was the femaleDatura he had collected with me; all the leaves, flowers, and seedpods that hehad stacked up before were dry. He took the long piece of root shaped like theletter Y and tied the bundle again.The root had dried and shrivelled and the bars of the fork had become morewidely separated and more contorted. He put the root on his lap, opened hisleather pouch, and pulled out his knife. He held the dry root in front of me.“This part is for the head,” he said, and made the first incision on the tail ofthe Y, which in an upside-down position resembled the shape of a man with hislegs spread out.“This is for the heart,” he said, and cut close to the joint of the Y. Next hechopped the tips of the root, leaving about three inches of wood on each bar ofthe Y. Then, slowly and patiently he carved the shape of a man.The root was dry and fibrous. In order to carve it, don Juan made two incisionsand peeled the fibres between them to the depth of the cuts. Nevertheless, whenhe came to details, he chiselled the wood, as when he shaped the arms and thehands.The final product was a wiry figurine of a man, arms folded over the chest andhands in a clasping position.Don Juan got up and walked to a blue agave growing in front of the house, nextto the porch. He took the hard thorn of one of the centre, pulpy leaves, bentit, and rotated it three or four times.The circular motion almost detached it from the leaf; it hung loose. He bit onit, or rather, he held it between his teeth, and yanked it out. The thorn cameout from the pulp, bringing with it a white tail, two feet long. Still holdingthe thorn between his teeth, don Juan twisted the fibres together between thepalms of his hands and made a string, which he wrapped around the figurine’slegs to bring them together. He encircled the lower part of the body until thestring was all used up; then very skilfully he worked the thorn like an awlinside the front part of the body under the folded arms, until the sharp tipemerged as though popping out of the figurine’s hands. He used his teeth againand, by pulling gently, brought the thorn nearly all the way out. It looked likea long spear protruding from the figure’s chest. Without looking at the figureany more, don Juan placed it inside his leather pouch. He seemed exhausted fromthe effort.He lay down on the floor and fell asleep.It was already dark when he woke up. We ate the groceries I had brought him andsat on the porch for a while longer. Then don Juan walked to the back of thehouse, carrying the three burlap bundles. He cut twigs and dry branches andstarted a fire. We sat in front of it comfortably, and he opened all threebundles. Besides the one containing the dry pieces of the female plant, therewas another with all that was left of the male plant, and a third, bulky onecontaining green, freshly cut pieces of Datura.Don Juan went to the pig’s trough and came back with a stone mortar, a very deepone that looked more like a pot whose bottom ended in a soft curve. He made ashallow hole and set the mortar firmly on the ground. He put more dry twigs onthe fire, then took the two bundles with the dry pieces of male and femaleplants and emptied them into the mortar all at once. He shook the burlap to makesure that all the debris had fallen into the mortar. From the third bundle heextracted two fresh pieces of Datura root.“I am going to prepare them just for you,” he said.“What kind of a preparation is it, don Juan?”“One of these pieces comes from a male plant, the other from a female plant.This is the only time the two plants should be put together. The pieces comefrom a depth of one yard.”He mashed them inside the mortar with even strokes of the pestle. As he did so,he chanted in a low voice, which sounded like a rhythmless, monotonous hum. Thewords were unintelligible to me. He was absorbed in his task.When the roots were completely mashed he took some Datura leaves from thebundle. They were clean and freshly cut, and all were intact and free ofwormholes and cuts. He dropped them into the mortar one at a time. He took ahandful of Datura flowers and dropped them also into the mortar in the samedeliberate manner. I counted fourteen of each. Then he got a bunch of fresh,green seedpods which had all their spikes and were not open. I could not countthem because he dropped them into the mortar all at once, but I assumed thatthere were also fourteen of them. He added three stems of Datura without anyleaves. They were dark red and clean and seemed to have belonged to largeplants, judging by their multiple ramifications.After all these items had been put into the mortar, he mashed them to a pulpwith the same even strokes. At a certain moment he tipped the mortar over, andwith his hand scooped the mixture into an old pot. He stretched out his hand tome, and I thought he wanted me to dry it. Instead, he took my left hand and witha very fast motion separated the middle and fourth fingers as far as he could.Then, with the point of his knife, he stabbed me right in between the twofingers and ripped downwards on the skin of the fourth finger. He acted with somuch skill and speed that when I jerked my hand away it was deeply cut, and theblood was flowing abundantly. He grabbed my hand again, placed it over the pot,and squeezed it to force more blood out.My arm got numb. I was in a state of shock—strangely cold and rigid, with anoppressive sensation in my chest and ears. I felt I was sliding down on my seat.I was fainting! He let go my hand and stirred the contents of the pot. When Irecovered from the shock I was really angry with him. It took me quite some timeto regain my composure.He set up three stones around the fire and placed the pot on top of them. To allthe ingredients he added something that I took to be a big chunk of carpenter’sglue and a pot of water, and let all that boil. Datura plants have, bythemselves, a very peculiar odour. Combined with the carpenter’s glue, whichgave off a strong odour when the mixture began to boil, they created so pungenta vapour that I had to fight not to vomit.The mix boiled for a long time as we sat there motionless in front of it. Attimes, when the wind blew the vapour in my direction, the stench enveloped me,and I held my breath in an effort to avoid it.Don Juan opened his leather pouch and took the figurine out; he handed it to mecarefully and told me to place it inside the pot without burning my hands. I letit slip gently into the boiling mush. He got out his knife, and for a second Ithought he was going to slash me again; instead, he pushed the figurine with thetip of the knife and sank it.He watched the mush boil for a while longer, and then began to clean the mortar.I helped him. When we had finished he set the mortar and pestle against thefence. We went inside the house, and the pot was left on the stones all night.The next morning at dawn don Juan instructed me to pull the figurine out of theglue and hang it from the roof facing the east, to dry in the sun. At noon itwas stiff as a wire. The heat had sealed the glue, and the green colour of theleaves had mixed with it. The figurine had a glossy, eerie finish.Don Juan asked me to get the figurine down. Then he handed me a leather pouch hehad made out of an old suede jacket I had brought for him some time before. Thepouch looked like the one he owned himself. The only difference was that his wasmade of soft, brown leather.“Put your «image» inside the pouch and close it,” he said.He did not look at me, and deliberately kept his head turned away. Once I hadthe figurine inside the pouch he gave me a carrying net, and told me to put theclay pot inside the net.He walked to my car, took the net from my hands, and fastened it onto the openlid of the glove compartment.“Come with me,” he said.I followed him. He walked around the house, making a complete clockwise circle.He stopped at the porch and circled the house again, this time goingcounterclockwise and again returning to the porch. He stood motionless for sometime, and then sat down.I was conditioned to believe that everything he did had some meaning. I waswondering about the significance of circling the house when he said, “Hey! Ihave forgotten where I put it.”I asked him what he was looking for. He said he had forgotten where he hadplaced the shoot I was to replant. We walked around the house once more beforehe remembered where it was.He showed me a small glass jar on a piece of board nailed to the wall below theroof. The jar contained the other half of the first portion of the Datura root.The shoot had an incipient growth of leaves at its top end. The jar contained asmall amount of water, but no soil.“Why doesn’t it hay any soil?” I asked.“All soils are not the same and the devil’s weed must know only the soil onwhich she will live and grow. And now it is time to return her to the groundbefore the worms damage her.”“Can we plant her here near the house?” I asked.“No! No! Not around here. She must be returned to a place of your liking.”“But where can I find a place of my liking?”“I don’t know that. You can replant her wherever you want.But she must be cared for and looked after, because she must live so that youwill have the power you need. If she dies, it means that she does not want you,and you must not disturb her further. It means you won’t have power over her.Therefore, you must care for her, and look after her, so that she will grow.You must not pamper her, though.”“Why not?”“Because if it is not her will to grow, it is of no use to entice her. But, onthe other hand, you must prove that you care. Keep the worms away and give herwater when you visit her. This must be done regularly until she seeds. After thefirst seeds bud out, we will be sure that she wants you.”“But, don Juan, it is not possible for me to look after the root the way youwish.”“If you want her power, you must do it! There is no other way!”“Can you take care of her for me when I am not here, don Juan?”“No! Not I! I can’t do that! Each one must nourish his own shoot. I had my own.Now you must have yours. And not until she has seeded, as I told you, can youconsider yourself ready for learning.”“Where do you think I should replant her?”“That is for you alone to decide! And nobody must know the place, not even I!That is the way the replanting must be done.Nobody, but nobody, can know where your plant is. If a stranger follows you, orsees you, take the shoot and run away to another place. He could cause youunimaginable harm through manipulating the shoot. He could cripple or kill you.That’s why not even I must know where your plant is.”He handed me the little jar with the shoot.“Take it now.”I took it. Then he almost dragged me to my car.“Now you must leave. Go and pick the spot where you will replant the shoot. Diga deep hole, in soft dirt, next to a watery place. Remember; she must be nearwater in order to grow. Dig the hole with your hands only, even if they bleed.Place thc shoot in the centre of the hole and make a mound [pilon] around it.Then soak it with water. When the water sinks, fill the hole with soft dirt.Next, pick a spot two paces away from the shoot, in that direction [pointing tothe southeast]. Dig another deep hole there, also with your hands, and dump intoit what is in the pot. Then smash the pot and bury it deep in another place, farfrom the spot where your shoot is. When you have buried the pot go back to yourshoot and water it once more. Then take out your image, hold it between thefingers where the flesh wound is, and, standing on the spot where you haveburied the glue, touch the shoot lightly with the sharp needle. Circle the shootfour times, stopping each time in the same spot to touch it.”“Do I have to follow a specific direction when I go around the root?”“Any direction will do. But you must always remember in what direction youburied the glue, and what direction you took when you circled the shoot. Touchthe shoot lightly with the point every time except the last, when you mustthrust it deep.But do it carefully; kneel for a more steady hand because you must not break thepoint inside the shoot. If you break it, you are finished. The root will be ofno use to you.”“Do I have to say any words while I go around the shoot?”“No, I will do that for you.”Saturday, 27 January 1962As soon as I got to his house this morning don Juan told me he was going to showme how to prepare the smoke mixture. We walked to the hills and went quite a wayinto one of the canyons.He stopped next to a tall, slender bush whose colour contrasted markedly withthat of the surrounding vegetation. The chaparral around the bush was yellowish,but the bush was bright green.“From this little tree you must take the leaves and the flowers,” he said. “Theright time to pick them is All Souls” Day [el dia de las animas].”He took out his knife and chopped off the end of a thin branch. He chose anothersimilar branch and also chopped off its tip. He repeated this operation until hehad a handful of branch tips. Then he sat down on the ground.“Look here,” he said. “I have cut all the branches above the fork made by two ormore leaves and the stem. Do you see? They are all the same. I have used onlythe tip of each branch, where the leaves are fresh and tender. Now we must lookfor a shaded place.”We walked until he seemed to have found what he was looking for. He took a longstring from his pocket and tied it to the trunk and the lower branches of twobushes, making a kind of clothesline on which he hung the branch tips upsidedown. He arranged them along the string in a neat fashion; hooked by the forkbetween the leaves and the stem, they resembled a long row of green horsemen.“One must see that the leaves dry in the shade,” he said. “The place must besecluded and difficult to get to. That way the leaves are protected. They mustbe left to dry in a place where it would be almost impossible to find them.After they have dried, they must be put in a bundle and sealed.”He picked up the leaves from the string and threw them into the nearby shrubs.Apparently he had intended only to show me the procedure.We continued walking and he picked three different flowers, saying they werepart of the ingredients and were supposed to be gathered at the same time. Butthe flowers had to be put in separate clay pots and dried in darkness; a lid hadto be placed on each pot so the flowers would turn mouldy inside the container.He said the function of the leaves and the flowers was to sweeten the smokemixture.We came out of the canyon and walked towards the riverbed.After a long detour we returned to his house. Late in the evening we sat in hisown room, a thing he rarely allowed me to do, and he told me about the finalingredient of the mixture, the mushrooms.“The real secret of the mixture lies in the mushrooms,” he said. “They are themost difficult ingredient to collect. The trip to the place where they grow islong and dangerous, and to select the right variety is even more perilous. Thereare other kinds of mushrooms growing alongside which are of no use; they wouldspoil the good ones if they were dried together. It takes time to know themushrooms well in order not to make a mistake. Serious harm will result fromusing the wrong kind harm to the man and to the pipe. I know of men who havedropped dead from using the foul smoke.“As soon as the mushrooms are picked they are put inside a gourd, so there is noway to recheck them. You see, they have to be torn to shreds in order to makethem go through the narrow neck of the gourd.”“How long do you keep the mushrooms inside the gourd?”“For a year. All the other ingredients are also sealed for a year. Then equalparts of them are measured and ground separately into a very fine powder. Thelittle mushrooms don’t have to be ground because they become a very fine dust bythemselves; all one needs to do is to mash the chunks. Four parts of mushroomsare added to one part of all the other ingredients together. Then they are allmixed and put into a bag like mine.”He pointed to the little sack hanging under his shirt.“Then all the ingredients are gathered again, and after they have been put todry you are ready to smoke the mixture you have just prepared. In your own case,you will smoke next year. And the year after that, the mixture will be all yoursbecause you will have gathered it by yourself. The first time you smoke I willlight the pipe for you. You will smoke all the mixture in the bowl and wait. Thesmoke will come. You will feel it. It will set you free to see anything you wantto see. Properly speaking, it is a matchless ally. But whoever seeks it musthave an intent and a will beyond reproach. He needs them because he has tointend and will his return, or the smoke will not let him come back. Second, hemust intend and will to remember whatever the smoke allowed him to see,otherwise it will be nothing more than a piece of fog in his mind.”Saturday, {Sunday?} 8 April 1962In our conversations, don Juan consistently used or referred to the phrase “manof knowledge”, but never explained what he meant by it. I asked him about it.“A man of knowledge is one who has followed truthfully the hardships oflearning,” he said. “A man who has, without rushing or without faltering, goneas far as he can in unravelling the secrets of power and knowledge.”“Can anyone be a man of knowledge?”“No, not anyone.”“Then what must a man do to become a man of knowledge?”“He must challenge and defeat his four natural enemies.”“Will he be a man of knowledge after defeating these four enemies?”“Yes. A man can call himself a man of knowledge only if he is capable ofdefeating all four of them.”“Then, can anybody who defeats these enemies be a man of knowledge?”“Anybody who defeats them becomes a man of knowledge.”“But are there any special requirements a man must fulfill before fighting withthese enemies?”“No. Anyone can try to become a man of knowledge; very few men actually succeed,but that is only natural. The enemies a man encounters on the path of learningto become a man of knowledge are truly formidable; most men succumb to them.”“What kind of enemies are they, don Juan?”He refused to talk about the enemies. He said it would be a long time before thesubject would make any sense to me. I tried to keep the topic alive and askedhim if he thought I could become a man of knowledge. He said no man couldpossibly tell that for sure. But I insisted on knowing if there were any clueshe could use to determine whether or not I had a chance of becoming a man ofknowledge. He said it would depend on my battle against the four enemies—whetherI could defeat them or would be defeated by them—but it was impossible toforetell the outcome of that fight.I asked him if he could use witchcraft or divination to see the outcome of thebattle. He flatly stated that the result of the struggle could not be foreseenby any means, because becoming a man of knowledge was a temporary thing. When Iasked him to explain this point, he replied:“To be a man of knowledge has no permanence. One is never a man of knowledge,not really. Rather, one becomes a man of knowledge for a very brief instant,after defeating the four natural enemies.”“You must tell me, don Juan, what kind of enemies they are.”He did not answer. I insisted again, but he dropped the subject and started totalk about something else.Sunday, 15 April 1962As I was getting ready to leave, I decided to ask him once more about theenemies of a man of knowledge. I argued that I could not return for some time,and it would be a good idea to write down what he had to say and then thinkabout it while I was away.He hesitated for a while, but then began to talk.“When a man starts to learn, he is never clear about his objectives. His purposeis faulty; his intent is vague. He hopes for rewards that will nevermaterialize, for he knows nothing of the hardships of learning.“He slowly begins to learn—bit by bit at first, then in big chunks. And histhoughts soon clash. What he learns is never what he pictured, or imagined, andso he begins to be afraid.Learning is never what one expects. Every step of learning is a new task, andthe fear the man is experiencing begins to mount mercilessly, unyieldingly. Hispurpose becomes a battlefield.“And thus he has tumbled upon the first of his natural enemies: Fear! A terribleenemy—treacherous, and difficult to overcome. It remains concealed et every turnof the way, prowling, waiting. And if the man, terrified in its presence, runsaway, his enemy will have put an end to his quest.”“What will happen to the man if he runs away in fear?”“Nothing happens to him except that he will never learn. He will never become aman of knowledge. He will perhaps be a bully or a harmless, scared man; at anyrate, he will be a defeated man. His first enemy will have put an end to hiscravings.”“And what can he do to overcome fear?”“The answer is very simple. He must not run away. He must defy his fear, and inspite of it he must take the next step in learning, and the next, and the next.He must be fully afraid, and yet he must not stop. That is the rule! And amoment will come when his first enemy retreats. The man begins to feel sure ofhimself. His intent becomes stronger. Learning is no longer a terrifying task.“When this joyful moment comes, the man can say without hesitation that he hasdefeated his first natural enemy.”“Does it happen at once, don Juan, or little by little?”“It happens little by little, and yet the fear is vanquished suddenly and fast.”“But won’t the man be afraid again if something new happens to him?”“No. Once a man has vanquished fear, he is free from it for the rest of his lifebecause, instead of fear, he has acquired clarity—a clarity of mind which erasesfear. By then a man knows his desires; he knows how to satisfy those desires. Hecan anticipate the new steps of learning, and a sharp clarity surroundseverything. The man feels that nothing is concealed.“And thus he has encountered his second enemy: Clarity!That clarity of mind, which is so hard to obtain, dispels fear, but also blinds.“It forces the man never to doubt himself. It gives him the assurance he can doanything he pleases, for he sees clearly into everything. And he is courageousbecause he is clear, and he stops at nothing because he is clear. But all thatis a mistake; it is like something incomplete. If the man yields to thismake-believe power, he has succumbed to his second enemy and will fumble withlearning. He will rush when he should be patient, or he will be patient when heshould rush. And he will fumble with learning until he winds up incapable oflearning anything more.”“What becomes of a man who is defeated in that way, don Juan? Does he die as aresult?”“No, he doesn’t die. His second enemy has just stopped him cold from trying tobecome a man of knowledge; instead, the man may turn into a buoyant warrior, ora clown. Yet the clarity for which he has paid so dearly will never change todarkness and fear again. He will be clear as long as he lives, but he will nolonger learn, or yearn for, anything.”“But what does he have to do to avoid being defeated?”“He must do what he did with fear: he must defy his clarity and use it only tosee, and wait patiently and measure carefully before taking new steps; he mustthink, above all, that his clarity is almost a mistake. And a moment will comewhen he will understand that his clarity was only a point before his eyes. Andthus he will have overcome his second enemy, and will arrive at a position wherenothing can harm him any more. This will not be a mistake. It will not be only apoint before his eyes. It will be true power.“He will know at this point that the power he has been pursuing for so long isfinally his. He can do with it whatever he pleases. His ally is at his command.His wish is the rule. He sees all that is around him. But he has also comeacross his third enemy: Power!“Power is the strongest of all enemies. And naturally the easiest thing to do isto give in; after all, the man is truly invincible. He commands; he begins bytaking calculated risks, and ends in making rules, because he is a master.“A man at this stage hardly notices his third enemy closing in on him. Andsuddenly, without knowing, he will certainly have lost the battle. His enemywill have turned him into a cruel, capricious man.”“Will he lose his power?”“No, he will never lose his clarity or his power.”“What then will distinguish him from a man of knowledge?“A man who is defeated by power dies without really knowing how to handle it.Power is only a burden upon his fate. Such a man has no command over himself,and cannot tell when or how to use his power.”“Is the defeat by any of these enemies a final defeat?”“Of course it is final. Once one of these enemies overpowers a man there isnothing he can do.”“Is it possible, for instance, that the man who is defeated by power may see hiserror and mend his ways?”“No. Once a man gives in he is through.”“But what if he is temporarily blinded by power, and then refuses it?”“That means his battle is still on. That means he is still trying to become aman of knowledge. A man is defeated only when he no longer tries, and abandonshimself.”“But then, don Juan, it is possible that a man may abandon himself to fear foryears, but finally conquer it.”“No, that is not true. If he gives in to fear he will never conquer it, becausehe will shy away from learning and never try again. But if he tries to learn foryears in the midst of his fear, he will eventually conquer it because he willnever have really abandoned himself to it.”“How can he defeat his third enemy, don Juan?”“He has to defy it, deliberately. He has to come to realize the power he hasseemingly conquered is in reality never his. He must keep himself in line at alltimes, handling carefully and faithfully all that he has learned. If he can seethat clarity and power, without his control over himself, are worse thanmistakes, he will reach a point where everything is held in check. He will knowthen when and how to use his power. And thus he will have defeated his thirdenemy.“The man will he, by then, at the end of his journey of learning, and almostwithout warning he will come upon the last of his enemies: Old age! This enemyis the cruellest of all, the one he won’t be able to defeat completely, but onlyfight away.“This is the time when a man has no more fears, no more impatient clarity ofmind—a time when all his power is in check, but also the time when he has anunyielding desire to rest. If he gives in totally to his desire to lie down andforget, if he soothes himself in tiredness, he will have lost his last round,and his enemy will cut him down into a feeble old creature. His desire toretreat will overrule all his clarity, his power, and his knowledge.“But if the man sloughs off his tiredness, and lives his fate through, he canthen be called a man of knowledge, if only for the brief moment when he succeedsin fighting off his last, invincible enemy. That moment of clarity, power, andknowledge is enough.”4Don Juan seldom spoke openly about Mescalito. Every time I questioned him on thesubject he refused to talk, but he always said enough to create an impression ofMescalito; an impression that was always anthropomorphic. Mescalito was a male,not only because of the mandatory grammatical rule that gives the word amasculine gender, but also because of his constant qualities of being aprotector and a teacher. Don Juan reaffirmed these characteristics in variousforms every time we talked.Sunday, 24 December 1961“The devil’s weed has never protected anyone. She serves only to give power.Mescalito, on the other hand, is gentle, like a baby.”“But you said Mescalito is terrifying at times.”“Of course he is terrifying, but once you get to know him, he is gentle andkind.”“How does he show his kindness?”“He is a protector and a teacher.”“How does he protect?”“You can keep him with you at all times and he will see that nothing bad happensto you.”“How can you keep him with you at all times?”“In a little bag, fastened under your arm or around your neck with a string.”“Do you have him with you?”“No, because I have an ally. But other people do.”“What does he teach?”“He teaches you to live properly.”“How does he teach?”“He shows things and tells what is what [enzenna las cosas y te dice lo queson].”“How?”“You will have to see for yourself.”Tuesday, 30 January 1962“What do you see when Mescalito takes you with him, don Juan?”“Such things are not for ordinary conversation. I can’t tell you that.”“Would something bad happen to you if you told?”“Mescalito is a protector, a kind, gentle protector; but that does not mean youcan make fun of him. Because he is a kind protector he can also be horror itselfwith those he does not like.”“I do not intend to make fun of him. I just want to know what he makes otherpeople do or see. I described to you all thatMescalito made me see, don Juan.”“With you it is different, perhaps because you don’t know his ways. You have tobe taught his ways as a child is taught how to walk.”“How long do I still have to be taught?”“Until he himself begins to make sense to you.”“And then?”“Then you will understand by yourself. You won’t have to tell me anything anymore.”“Can you just tell me where Mescalito takes you?”“I can’t talk about it.”“All I want to know is if there is another world to which he takes people.”“There is.”“Is it heaven?” (The Spanish word for heaven is cielo, but that also means“sky”.)“He takes you through the sky [cielo].”“I mean, is it heaven [cielo] where God is?”“You are being stupid now. I don’t know where God is.”“Is Mescalito God—the only God? Or is he one of the gods?”“He is just a protector and a teacher. He is a power.”“Is he a power within ourselves?”“No. Mescalito has nothing to do with ourselves. He is outside us.”“Then everyone who takes Mescalito must see him in the same form.”“No, not at all. He is not the same for everybody.”Thursday, 12 April 1962“Why don’t you tell me more about Mescalito, don Juan?”“There is nothing to tell.”"},{"pageContent":"“There must be thousands of things I should know before I encounter him again.”“No. Perhaps for you there is nothing you have to know. As I have already toldyou, he is not the same for everyone.”“I know, but still I’d like to know how others feel about him.”“The opinion of those who care to talk about him is not worth much. You willsee. You will probably talk about him up to a certain point, and from then onyou will never discuss him.”“Can you tell me about your own first experiences?”“What for?”“Then I’ll know how to behave with Mescalito.”“You already know more than I do. You actually played with him. Someday you willsee how kind the protector was with you. That first time I am sure he told youmany, many things, but you were deaf and blind.”Saturday, 14 April 1962“Does Mescalito take any form when he shows himself?”“Yes, any form.”“Then, which are the most common forms you know?”“There are no common forms.”“Do you mean, don Juan, that he appears in any form, even to men who know himwell?”“No. He appears in any form to those who know him only a little, but to thosewho know him well, he is always constant.”“How is he constant?”“He appears to them sometimes as a man, like us, or as a light.”“Does Mescalito ever change his permanent form with those who know him well?”“Not to my knowledge.”Friday, 6 July 1962Don Juan and I started on a trip late in the afternoon of Saturday23 June. He said we were going to look for honguitos (mushrooms) in the state ofChihuahua. He said it was going to be a long, hard trip. He was right. Wearrived in a little mining town in northern Chihuahua at 10:00 p.m. on Wednesday27 June.We walked from the place I had parked the car at the outskirts of town, to thehouse of his friends, a Tarahumara Indian and his wife. We slept there.The next morning the man woke us up around five. He brought us gruel and beans.He sat and talked to don Juan while we ate, but he said nothing concerning ourtrip.After breakfast the man put water into my canteen, and two sweet-rolls into myknapsack. Don Juan handed me the canteen, fixed the knapsack with a cord overhis shoulders, thanked the man for his courtesies, and, turning to me, said, “Itis time to go.”We walked on the dirt road for about a mile. From there we cut through thefields and in two hours we were at the foot of the hills south of town. Weclimbed the gentle slopes in a southwesterly direction. When we reached thesteeper inclines, don Juan changed directions and we followed a high valley tothe east. Despite his advanced age, don Juan kept up a pace so incredibly fastthat by midday I was completely exhausted. We sat down and he opened the breadsack.“You can eat all of it, if you want,” he said.“How about you?”“I am not hungry, and we won’t need this food later on.”I was very tired and hungry and took him up on his offer. I felt this was a goodtime to talk about the purpose of our trip, and quite casually I asked, “Do youthink we are going to stay here for a long time?”“We are here to gather some Mescalito. We will stay until tomorrow.”“Where is Mescalito?”“All around us.”Cacti of many species were growing in profusion all through the area, but Icould not distinguish peyote among them.We started to hike again and by three o’clock we came to a long, narrow valleywith steep side hills. I felt strangely excited at the idea of finding peyote,which I had never seen in its natural environment. We entered the valley andmust have walked about four hundred feet when suddenly I spotted threeunmistakable peyote plants. They were in a cluster a few inches above the groundin front of me, to the left of the path. They looked like round, pulpy, greenroses. I ran towards them, pointing them out to don Juan.He ignored me and deliberately kept his back turned as he walked away. I knew Ihad done the wrong thing, and for the rest of the afternoon we walked insilence, moving slowly on the flat valley floor, which was covered with small,sharp-edged rocks. We moved among the cacti, disturbing crowds of lizards and attimes a solitary bird. And I passed scores of peyote plants without saying aword.At six o’clock we were at the bottom of the mountains that marked the end of thevalley. We climbed to a ledge. Don Juan dropped his sack and sat down.I was hungry again, but we had no food left; I suggested that we pick up theMescalito and head back for town. He looked annoyed and made a smacking soundwith his lips. He said we were going to spend the night there.We sat quietly. There was a rock wall to the left, and to the right was thevalley we had just crossed. It extended for quite a distance and seemed to bewider than, and not so flat as,I had thought. Viewed from the spot where I sat, it was full of small hills andprotuberances.“Tomorrow we will start walking back,” don Juan said with out looking at me, andpointing to the valley. “We will work our way back and pick him as we cross thefield. That is, we will pick him only when he is in our way. He will find us andnot the other way around. He will find us—if he wants to.”Don Juan rested his back against the rock wall and, with his head turned to hisside, continued talking as though another person were there besides myself. “Onemore thing. Only I can pick him. You will perhaps carry the bag, or walk aheadof me I don’t know yet. But tomorrow you will not point at him as you didtoday!”“I am sorry, don Juan.”“It is all right. You didn’t know.”“Did your benefactor teach you all this about Mescalito?”“No! Nobody has taught me about him. It was the protector himself who was myteacher.”“Then Mescalito is like a person to whom you can talk?”“No, he isn’t.”“How does he teach, then?”He remained silent for a while.“Remember the time when you played with him? You understood what he meant,didn’t you?”“I did!”“That is the way he teaches. You did not know it then, but if you had paidattention to him, he would have talked to you.”“When?”“When you saw him for the first time.”He seemed to be very annoyed by my questioning. I told him I had to ask allthese questions because I wanted to find out all I could.“Don’t ask me!” He smiled maliciously. “Ask him. The next time you see him, askhim everything you want to know.”“Then Mescalito is like a person you can talk . . .”He did not let me finish. He turned away, picked up the canteen, stepped downfrom the ledge, and disappeared around the rock. I did not want to be alonethere, and even though he had not asked me to go along, I followed him. Wewalked for about five hundred feet to a small creek. He washed his hands andface end filled up the canteen. He swished water around in his mouth, but didnot drink it. I scooped up some water in my hands and drank, but he stopped meand said it was unnecessary to drink.He handed me the canteen and started to walk back to the ledge. When we gotthere we sat again facing the valley with our backs to the rock wall. I asked ifwe could build a fire. He reacted as if it was inconceivable to ask such athing. He said that for that night we were Mescalito’s guests and he was goingto keep us warm.It was already dusk. Don Juan pulled two thin, cotton blankets from his sack,threw one into my lap, and sat crosslegged with the other one over hisshoulders. Below us the valley was dark, with its edges already diffused in theevening mist.Don Juan sat motionless facing the peyote field. A steady wind blew on my face.“The twilight is the crack between the worlds,” he said softly, without turningto me.I didn’t ask what he meant. My eyes became tired. Suddenly I felt elated; I hada strange, overpowering desire to weep!I lay on my stomach; the rock floor was hard and uncomfortable, and I had tochange my position every few minutes. Finally I sat up and crossed my legs,putting the blanket over my shoulders. To my amazement this position wassupremely comfortable, and I fell asleep.When I woke up, I heard don Juan talking to me. It was very dark. I could notsee him well. I did not understand what he said, but I followed him when hestarted to go down from the ledge. We moved carefully, or at least I did,because of the darkness. We stopped at the bottom of the rock wall. Don Juan satdown and signalled me to sit at his left. He opened up his shirt and took out aleather sack, which he opened and placed on the ground in front of him. Itcontained a number of dried peyote buttons.After a long pause he picked up one of the buttons. He held it in his righthand, rubbing it several times between the thumb and the first finger as hechanted softly. Suddenly he let out a tremendous cry.“Ahiiii!”It was weird, unexpected. It terrified me. Vaguely I saw him place the peyotebutton in his mouth and begin to chew it. After a moment he picked up the wholesack, leaned towards me, and told me in a whisper to take the sack, pick out onemescalito, put the sack in front of us again, and then do exactly as he did.I picked a peyote button and rubbed it as he had done. Meanwhile he chanted,swaying back and forth. I tried to put the button into my mouth several times,but I felt embarrassed to cry out. Then, as in a dream, an unbelievable shriekcame out of me: Ahiiii! For a moment I thought it was someone else. Again I feltthe effects of a nervous shock in my stomach. I was falling backwards. I wasfainting. I put the peyote button into my mouth and chewed it. After a while donJuan picked up another from the sack. I was relieved to see that he put it intohis mouth after a short chant. He passed the sack to me, and I placed it infront of us again after taking one button. This cycle went on five times beforeI noticed any thirst. I picked up the canteen to drink, but don Juan told mejust to wash my mouth, and not to drink or I would vomit.I swished the water around in my mouth repeatedly. At a certain moment drinkingwas a formidable temptation, and I swallowed a bit of water. Immediately mystomach began to convulse. I expected to have a painless and effortless flowingof liquid from my mouth, as had happened during my first experience with peyote,but to my surprise I had only the ordinary sensation of vomiting. It did notlast long, however.Don Juan picked up another button and handed me the sack, and the cycle wasrenewed and repeated until I had chewed fourteen buttons. By this time all myearly sensations of thirst, cold, and discomfort had disappeared. In their placeI felt an unfamiliar sense of warmth and excitation. I took the canteen tofreshen my mouth, but it was empty.“Can we go to the creek, don Juan?”The sound of my voice did not project out, but hit the roof of my palate,bounced back into my throat, end echoed to and from between them. The echo wassoft and musical, and seemed to have wings that flapped inside my throat. Itstouch soothed me. I followed its back-and-forth movements until it had vanished.I repeated the question. My voice sounded as though I was talking inside avault.Don Juan did not answer. I got up and turned in the direction of the creek. Ilooked at him to see if he was coming, but he seemed to be listening attentivelyto something.He made an imperative sign with his hand to be quiet.“Abuhtol [?] is already here!” he said.I had never heard that word before, and I was wondering whether to ask him aboutit when I detected a noise that seemed to be a buzzing inside my ears. The soundbecame louder by degrees until it was like the vibration caused by an enormousbull-roarer. It lasted for a brief moment and subsided gradually untileverything was quiet again. The violence and the intensity of the noiseterrified me. I was shaking so much that I could hardly remain standing, yet Iwas perfectly rational. If I had been drowsy a few minutes before, this feelinghad totally vanished, giving way to a state of extreme lucidity. The noisereminded me of a science fiction movie in which a gigantic bee buzzed its wingscoming out of an atomic radiation area. I laughed at the thought. I saw don Juanslumping back into his relaxed position. And suddenly the image of a giganticbee accosted me again. It was more real than ordinary thoughts. It stood alonesurrounded by an extraordinary clarity. Everything else was driven from my mind.This state of mental clearness, which had no precedents in my life, producedanother moment of terror.I began to perspire. I leaned toward don Juan to tell him I was afraid. His facewas a few inches from mine. He was looking at me, but his eyes were the eyes ofa bee. They looked like round glasses that had a light of their own in thedarkness. His lips were pushed out, and from them came a pattering noise:“Pehtuh-peh-tuh-pet-tuh.” I jumped backward, nearly crashing into the rock wall.For a seemingly endless time I experienced an unbearable fear. I was panting andwhining. The perspiration had frozen on my skin, giving me an awkward rigidity.Then I heard don Juan’s voice saying, “Get up! Move around! Get up !”The image vanished and again I could see his familiar face.“I’ll get some water,” I said after another endless moment.My voice cracked. I could hardly articulate the words. Don Juan nodded yes. As Iwalked away I realized that my fear had gone as fast and as mysteriously as ithad come.Upon approaching the creek I noticed that I could see every object in the way. Iremembered I had just seen don Juan clearly, whereas earlier I could hardlydistinguish the outlines of his figure. I stopped and looked into the distance,and I could even see across the valley, Some boulders on the other side becameperfectly visible. I thought it must be early morning, but it occurred to methat I might have lost track of time. I looked at my watch. It was ten totwelve! I checked the watch to see if it was working. It couldn’t be midday; ithad to be midnight! I intended to make a dash for the water and come back to therocks, but I saw don Juan coming down and I waited for him.I told him I could see in the dark.He stared at me for a long time without saying a word; if he did speak, perhapsI did not hear him, for I was concentrating on my new, unique ability to see inthe dark. I could distinguish the very minute pebbles in the sand. At momentseverything was so clear it seemed to be early morning, or dusk. Then it wouldget dark; then it would clear again. Soon I realized that the brightnesscorresponded to my heart’s diastole, and the darkness to its systole. The worldchanged from bright to dark to bright again with every beat of my heart.I was absorbed in this discovery when the same strange sound that I had heardbefore became audible again. My muscles stiffened.“Anuhctal [as I heard the word this time] is here,” don Juan said. I fancied theroar so thunderous, so overwhelming, that nothing else mattered. When it hadsubsided, I perceived a sudden increase in the volume of water. The creek, whicha minute before had been less than a foot wide, expanded until it was anenormous lake. Light that seemed to come from above it touched the surface asthough shining through thick foliage.From time to time the water would glitter for a second—gold and black. Then itwould remain dark, lightless, almost out of sight, and yet strangely present.I don’t recall how long I stayed there just watching, squatting on the shore ofthe black lake. The roar must have subsided in the meantime, because what joltedme back (to reality?) was again a terrifying buzzing. I turned around to lookfor don Juan. I saw him climbing up and disappearing behind the rock ledge. Yetthe feeling of being alone did not bother me at all; I squatted there in a stateof absolute confidence and abandonment. The roar again became audible; it wasvery intense, like the noise made by a high wind. Listening to it as carefullyas I could, I was able to detect a definite melody. It was a composite ofhigh-pitched sounds, like human voices, accompanied by a deep bass drum. Ifocused all my attention on the melody, and again noticed that the systole anddiastole of my heart coincided with the sound of the bass drum, and with thepattern of the music.I stood up and the melody stopped. I tried to listen to my heartbeat, but it wasnot detectable. I squatted again, thinking that perhaps the position of my bodyhad caused or induced the sounds! But nothing happened! Not a sound! Not even myheart! I thought I had had enough, but as I stood up to leave, I felt a tremorof the earth. The ground under my feet was shaking. I was losing my balance. Ifell backwards and remained on my back while the earth shook violently. I triedto grab a rock or a plant, but something was sliding under me. I jumped up,stood for a moment, and fell down again. The ground on which I sat was moving,sliding into the water like a raft. I remained motionless, stunned by a terrorthat was, like everything else, unique, uninterrupted, and absolute.I moved through the water of the black lake perched on a piece of soil thatlooked like an earthen log. I had the feeling I was going in a southerlydirection, transported by the current.I could see the water moving and swirling around. It felt cold, and oddly heavy,to the touch. I fancied it alive.There were no distinguishable shores or landmarks, and I can’t recall thethoughts or the feelings that must have come to me during this trip. After whatseemed like hours of drifting, my raft made a right-angle turn to the left, theeast. It continued to slide on the water for a very short distance, andunexpectedly rammed against something. The impact threw me forward. I closed myeyes and felt a sharp pain as my knees and my outstretched arms hit the ground.After a moment I looked up. I was lying on the dirt. It was as though my earthenlog had merged with the land. I set up and turned around. The water wasreceding! It moved backward, like a wave in reverse, until it disappeared.I sat there for a long time, trying to collect my thoughts and resolve all thathad happened into a coherent unit. My entire body ached. My throat felt like anopen sore; I had bitten my lips when I “landed”. I stood up. The wind made merealize I was cold. My clothes were wet. My hands and jaws and knees shook soviolently that I had to lie down again. Drops of perspiration slid into my eyesand burned them until I yelled with pain.After a while I regained a measure of stability and stood up.In the dark twilight, the scene was very clear. I took a couple of steps. Adistinct sound of many human voices came to me. They seemed to be talkingloudly. I followed the sound; I walked for about fifty yards and came to asudden stop. I had reached a dead end. The place where I stood was a corralformed by enormous boulders. I could distinguish another row, and then another,and another, until they merged into the sheer mountain.From among them came the most exquisite music. It was a fluid, uninterrupted,eerie flow of sounds.At the foot of one boulder I saw a man sitting on the ground, his face turnedalmost in profile. I approached him until I was perhaps ten feet away; then heturned his head and looked at me.I stopped—his eyes were the water I had just seen! They had the same enormousvolume, the sparkling of gold and black. His head was pointed like a strawberry;his skin was green, dotted with innumerable warts. Except for the pointed shape,his head was exactly like the surface of the peyote plant. I stood in front ofhim, staring; I couldn’t take my eyes away from him. I felt he was deliberatelypressing on my chest with the weight of his eyes. I was choking. I lost mybalance and fell to the ground. His eyes turned away. I heard him talking to me.At first his voice was like the soft rustle of a light breeze. Then I heard itas music—as a melody of voices—and I “knew” it was saying, “What do you want?”I knelt before him and talked about my life, then wept. He looked at me again. Ifelt his eyes pulling me away, and I thought that moment would be the moment ofmy death. He signalled me to come closer. I vacillated for an instant before Itook a step forward. As I came closer he turned his eyes away from me and showedme the back of his hand. The melody said, “Look!”There was a round hole in the middle of his hand. “Look!” said the melody again.I looked into the hole and I saw myself. I was very old and feeble and wasrunning stooped over, with bright sparks flying all around me. Then three of thesparks hit me, two in the head and one in the left shoulder. My figure, in thehole, stood up for a moment until it was fully vertical, and then disappearedtogether with the hole.Mescalito turned his eyes to me again. They were so close to me that I “heard”them rumble softly with that peculiar sound I had heard many times that night.They became peaceful by degrees until they were like a quiet pond rippled bygold and black flashes.He turned his eyes away once more and hopped like a cricket for perhaps fiftyyards. He hopped again and again, and was gone.The next thing I remember is that I began to walk. Very rationally I tried torecognize landmarks, such as mountains in the distance, in order to orientmyself. I had been obsessed by cardinal points throughout the whole experience,and I believed that north had to be to my left. I walked in that direction forquite a while before I realized that it was daytime, and that I was no longerusing my “night vision”. I remembered I had a watch and looked at the time. Itwas eight o’clock.It was about ten o’clock when I got to the ledge where I had been the nightbefore. Don Juan was lying on the ground asleep.“Where have you been?” he asked.I sat down to catch my breath.After a long silence he asked, “Did you see him?”I began to narrate to him the sequence of my experiences from the beginning, buthe interrupted me saying that all that mattered was whether I had seen him ornot. He asked how close to me Mescalito was. I told him I had nearly touchedhim.That part of my story interested him. He listened attentively to every detailwithout comment, interrupting only to ask questions about the form of the entityI had seen, its disposition, and other details about it. It was about noon whendon Juan seemed to have had enough of my story. He stood up and strapped acanvas bag to my chest; he told me to walk behind him and said he was going tocut Mescalito loose and I had to receive him in my hands and place him insidethe bag gently.We drank some water and started to walk. When we reached the edge of the valleyhe seemed to hesitate for a moment before deciding which direction to take. Oncehe had made his choice we walked in a straight line.Every time we came to a peyote plant, he squatted in front of it and very gentlycut off the top with his short, serrated knife.He made an incision level with the ground, and, sprinkled the“wound”, as he called it, with pure sulphur powder which he carried in a leathersack. He held the fresh button in his left hand and spread the powder with hisright hand. Then he stood up and handed me the button, which I received withboth hands, as he had prescribed, and placed inside the bag. “Stand erect anddon’t let the bag touch the ground or the bushes or anything else,” he saidrepeatedly, as though he thought I would forget.We collected sixty-five buttons. When the bag was completely filled, he put iton my back and strapped a new one to my chest.By the time we had crossed the plateau we had two full sacks, containing onehundred and ten peyote buttons. The bags were so heavy and bulky that I couldhardly walk under their weight and volume.Don Juan whispered to me that the bags were heavy becauseMescalito wanted to return to the ground. He said it was the sadness of leavinghis abode which made Mescalito heavy; my real chore was not to let the bagstouch the ground, because if I did Mescalito would never allow me to take himagain.At one particular moment the pressure of the straps on my shoulders becameunbearable. Something was exerting tremendous force in order to pull me down. Ifelt very apprehensive.I noticed that I had started to walk faster, almost at a run; I was in a waytrotting behind don Juan.Suddenly the weight on my back and chest diminished. The load became spongy andlight. I ran freely to catch up with don Juan, who was ahead of me. I told him Idid not feel the weight any longer. He explained that we had already leftMescalito’s abode.Tuesday, 3 July 1962“I think Mescalito has almost accepted you,” don Juan said.“Why do you say he has almost accepted me, don Juan?”“He did not kill you, or even harm you. He gave you a good fright, but not areally bad one. If he had not accepted you at all, he would have appeared to youas monstrous and full of wrath.Some people have learned the meaning of horror upon encountering him and notbeing accepted by him.”“If he is so terrible, why didn’t you tell me about it before you took me to thefield?”“You do not have the courage to seek him deliberately. I thought it would bebetter if you did not know.”“But I might have died, don Juan!”“Yes, you might have. But I was certain it was going to be all right for you. Heplayed with you once. He did not harm you. I thought he would also havecompassion for you this time.”I asked him if he really thought Mescalito had had compassion for me. Theexperience had been terrifying; I felt that I had nearly died of fright.He said Mescalito had been most kind to me; he had shown me a scene that was ananswer to a question. Don Juan saidMescalito had given me a lesson. I asked him what the lesson was and what itmeant. He said it would he impossible to answer that question because I had beentoo afraid to know exactly what I asked Mescalito.Don Juan probed my memory as to what I had said to Mescalito before he showed methe scene on his hand. But I could not remember. All I remembered was my fallingon my knees and “confessing my sins” to him.Don Juan seemed uninterested in talking about it any more.I asked him, “Can you teach me the words to the songs you chanted?”“No, I can’t. Those words are my own, the words the protector himself taught me.The songs are my songs. I can’t tell you what they are.”“Why can’t you tell me, don Juan?”“Because these songs are a link between the protector and myself. I am sure someday he will teach you your own songs.Wait until then; and never, absolutely never, copy or ask about the songs thatbelong to another man.”“What was the name you called out? Can you tell me that, don Juan?”“No. His name can never be voiced, except to call him.”“What if I want to call him myself?”“If some day he accepts you, he will tell you his name. That name will be foryou alone to use, either to call him loudly or to say quietly to yourself.Perhaps he will tell you his name is Jose. Who knows?”“Why is it wrong to use his name when talking about him?”“You have seen his eyes, haven’t you? You can’t fool around with the protector.That is why I can’t get over the fact that he chose to play with you!”“How can he be a protector when he hurts some people?”“The answer is very simple. Mescalito is a protector because he is available toanyone who seeks him.”“But isn’t it true that everything in the world is available to anyone who seeksit?”“No, that is not true. The ally powers are available only to the brujos, butanyone can partake of Mescalito.”“But why then does he hurt some people?”“Not everybody likes Mescalito; yet they all seek him with the idea of profitingwithout doing any work. Naturally their encounter with him is alwayshorrifying.”“What happens when he accepts a man completely?”“He appears to him as a man, or as a light. When a man has won this kind ofacceptance, Mescalito is constant. He never changes after that. Perhaps when youmeet him again he will be a light, and someday he may even take you flying andreveal all his secrets to you.”“What do I have to do to arrive at that point, don Juan?”“You have to be a strong man, and your life has to be truthful.”“What is a truthful life?”“A life lived with deliberateness, a good, strong life.”5Don Juan inquired periodically, in a casual way, about the state of my Daturaplant. In the year that had elapsed from the time I replanted the root, theplant had grown into a large bush. It had seeded and the seedpods had dried. Anddon Juan judged it was time for me to learn more about the devil’s weed.Sunday, 27 January 1963Today don Juan gave me the preliminary information on the“second portion” of the Datura root, the second step in learning the tradition.He said the second portion of the root was the real beginning of learning; incomparison with it, the first portion was like child’s play. The second portionhad to be mastered; it had to be intaken at least twenty times, he said, beforeone could go on to the third step.I asked, “What does the second portion do?”“The second portion of the devil’s weed is used for seeing.With it, a man can soar through the air to see what is going on at any place hechooses.”“Can a man actually fly through the air, don Juan?”“Why not? As I have already told you, the devil’s weed is for those who seekpower. The man who masters the second portion can use the devil’s weed to dounimaginable things to gain more power.”“What kind of things, don Juan?”“I can’t tell you that. Every man is different.”Monday, 28 January 1963Don Juan said: “If you complete the second step successfully,I can show you only one more step. In the course of learning about the devil’sweed, I realized she was not for me, and I did not pursue her path any further.”“What made you decide against it, don Juan?”“The devil’s weed nearly killed me every time I tried to use her. Once it was sobad I thought I was finished. And yet, I could have avoided all that pain.”“How? Is there a special way to avoid pain?”“Yes, there is a way.”“Is it a formula, a procedure, or what?”“It is a way of grabbing onto things. For instance, when I was learning aboutthe devil’s weed I was too eager. I grabbed onto things the way kids grab ontocandy. The devil’s weed is only one of a million paths. Anything is one of amillion paths [un camino entre cantidades de caminos]. Therefore you must alwayskeep in mind that a path is only a path; if you feel you should not follow it,you must not stay with it under any conditions. To have such clarity you mustlead a disciplined life.Only then will you know that any path is only a path, and there is no affront,to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you todo. But your decision to keep on the path or to leave it must be free of fear orambition. I warn you.Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you thinknecessary. Then ask yourself, and yourself alone, one question. This question isone that only a very old man asks. My benefactor told me about it once when Iwas young, and my blood was too vigorous for me to understand it. Now I dounderstand it. I will tell you what it is: Does this path have a heart? Allpaths are the same: they lead nowhere. They are paths going through the bush, orinto the bush. In my own life I could say I have traversed long, long paths, butI am not anywhere. My benefactor’s question has meaning now. Does this path havea heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn’t, it is of no use.Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn’t.One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it.The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakensyou.”Sunday, 21 April 1963On Tuesday afternoon, 16 April, don Juan and I went to the hills where hisDatura plants are. He asked me to leave him alone there, and wait for him in thecar. He returned nearly three hours later carrying a package wrapped in a redcloth. As we started to drive back to his house he pointed to the bundle andsaid it was his last gift for me.I asked if he meant he was not going to teach me any more. He explained that hewas referring to the fact that I had a plant fully mature and would no longerneed his plants.Late in the afternoon we sat in his room; he brought out a smoothly finishedmortar and pestle. The bowl of the mortar was about six inches in diameter. Heuntied a large package full of small bundles, selected two of them, and placedthem on a straw mat by my side; then he added four more bundles of the same sizefrom the pack he had carried home. He said they were seeds, and I had to grindthem. into a fine powder. He opened the first bundle and poured some of itscontents into the mortar. The seeds were dried, round and caramel yellow incolour.I began working with the pestle; after a while he corrected me.He told me to push the pestle against one side of the mortar first, and thenslide it across the bottom and up against the other side. I asked what he wasgoing to do with the powder. He did not want to talk about it.The first batch of seeds was extremely hard to grind. It took me four hours tofinish the job. My back ached because of the position in which I had beensitting. I lay down and wanted to go to sleep right there, but don Juan openedthe next bag and poured some of the contents into the mortar. The seeds thistime were slightly darker than the first ones, and were lumped together. Therest of the bag’s contents was a sort of powder, made of very small, round, darkgranules.I wanted something to eat, but don Juan said that if I wished to learn I had tofollow the rule, and the rule was that I could only drink a little water whilelearning the secrets of the second portion.The third bag contained a handful of live, black, grain weevils.And in the last bag were some fresh white seeds, almost mushy soft, but fibrousand difficult to grind into a fine paste, as he expected me to do. After I hadfinished grinding the contents of the four bags, don Juan measured two cups of agreenish water, poured it into a clay pot, and put the pot on the fire. When thewater was boiling he added the first batch of powdered seeds. He stirred it witha long, pointed piece of wood or bone which he carried in his leather pouch. Assoon as the water boiled again he added the other substances one by one,following the same procedure. Then he added one more cup of the same water, andlet the mixture simmer over a low fire.Then he told me it was time to mash the root. He carefully extracted a longpiece of Datura root from the bundle he had carried home. The root was aboutsixteen inches long. It was thick, perhaps an inch and a half in diameter. Hesaid it was the second portion, and again he had measured the second portionhimself, because it was still his root. He said the next time I tried thedevil’s weed I would have to measure my own root.He pushed the big mortar towards me, and I proceeded to pound the root inexactly the same way he had mashed the first portion. He directed me through thesame steps, and again we left the mashed root soaking in water, exposed to thenight air.By that time the boiling mixture had solidified in the clay pot.Don Juan took the pot from the fire, placed it inside a hanging net, and hookedit to a beam in the middle of the room.About eight o’clock in the morning of 17 April, don Juan and I began to leachthe root extract with water. It was a clear, sunny day, and don Juan interpretedthe fine weather as an omen that the devil’s weed liked me; he said that with mearound he could remember only how bad she had been with him.The procedure we followed in leaching the root extract was the same I hadobserved for the first portion. By late afternoon, after pouring out the topwater for the eighth time, there was a spoonful of a yellowish substance in thebottom of the bowl.We returned to his room where there were still two little sacks he had nottouched. He opened one, slid his hand inside, and wrinkled the open end aroundhis wrist with the other hand.He seemed to be holding something, judging by the way his hand moved inside thebag. Suddenly, with a swift movement, he peeled the bag off his hand like aglove, turning it inside out, and shoved his hand close to my face. He washolding a lizard.Its head was a few inches from my eyes. There was something strange about thelizard’s mouth. I gazed at it for a moment and then recoiled involuntarily. Thelizard’s mouth was sewed up with rude stitches. Don Juan ordered me to hold thelizard in my left hand. I clutched it; it wriggled against my palm. I feltnauseated. My hands began to perspire.He took the last bag, and, repeating the same motions, he extracted anotherlizard. He also held it close to my face. I saw that its eyelids were sewedtogether. He ordered me to hold this lizard in my right hand.By the time I had both lizards in my hands I was almost sick. I had anoverpowering desire to drop them and get out of there.“Don’t squeeze them!” he said, and his voice brought me a sense of relief anddirection. He asked what was wrong with me.He tried to be serious, but couldn’t keep a straight face and laughed. I triedto easy my grip, but my hands were sweating so profusely that the lizards beganto wriggle out of them. Their sharp little claws scratched my hands, producingan incredible feeling of disgust and nausea. I closed my eyes and clenched myteeth. One of the lizards was already sliding onto my wrist; all it needed wasto yank its head from between my fingers to be free.I had a peculiar sensation of physical despair, of supreme discomfort. I growledat don Juan, between my teeth, to take the damn things off me. My head shookinvoluntarily. He looked at me curiously. I growled like a bear, shaking mybody.He dropped the lizards into their bags and began to laugh. I wanted to laughalso, but my stomach was upset. I lay down.I explained to him that what had affected me was the sensation of their claw son my palms; he said there were lots of things that could drive a man mad,especially if he did not have the resolution, the purpose, required forlearning; but when a man had a clear, unbending intent, feelings were in no waya hindrance, for he was capable of controlling them.Don Juan waited awhile and then, going through the same motions, handed me thelizards again. He told me to hold their heads up and rub them softly against mytemples, as I asked them anything I wanted to know.I did not understand at first what he wanted me to do. He told me again to askthe lizards about anything I could not find out for myself. He gave me a wholeseries of examples: I could find out about persons I did not see ordinarily, orabout objects that were lost, or about places I had not seen. Then I realized hewas talking about divination. I got very excited. My heart began to pound. Ifelt that I was losing my breath.He warned me not to ask about personal matters this first time; he said I shouldthink rather of something that had nothing to do with me. I had to think fastand clearly because there would be no way of reversing my thoughts.I tried frantically to think of something I wanted to know.Don Juan urged me on imperiously, and I was astonished to realize I could thinkof nothing I wanted to “ask” the lizards.After a painfully long wait I thought of something. Some time earlier a largenumber of books had been stolen from a reading room. It was not a personalmatter, and yet I was interested in it. I had no preconceived ideas about theidentity of the person, or persons, who had taken the books. I rubbed thelizards against my temples, asking them who the thief was.After a while don Juan put the lizards inside their bags, and said that therewere no deep secrets about the root and the paste.The paste was made to give direction; the root made things clear.But the real mystery was the lizards. They were the secret of the whole sorceryof the second portion, he said. I asked whether they were a special kind oflizard. He said they were. They had to come from the area of one’s own plant;they had to be one’s friends. And to have lizards as friends, he said, requireda long period of grooming. One had to develop a strong friendship with them bygiving them food and speaking kind words to them.I asked why their friendship was so important. He said the lizards would allowthemselves to be caught only if they knew the man, and whoever took the devil’sweed seriously had to treat the lizards seriously. He said that, as a rule, thelizards should be caught after the paste and the root had been prepared.They should be caught in the late afternoon. If one was not on intimate termswith the lizards, he said, days could be spent trying to catch them withoutsuccess; and the paste lasts only one day. He then gave me a long series ofinstructions concerning the procedure to follow after the lizards had beencaught.“Once you have caught the lizards, put them in separate bags.Then take the first one and talk to her. Apologize for hurting her, and beg herto help you. And with a wooden needle sew up her mouth. Use the fibres of agaveand one of the thorns of a choya to do the sewing. Draw the stitches tight. Thentell the other lizard the same things and sew her eyelids together. By the timenight begins to fall you will be ready. Take the lizard with the sewed-up mouthand explain to her the matter you want to know about. Ask her to go and see foryou; tell her you had to sew up her mouth so she would hurry back to you and nottalk to anyone else. Let her scramble in the paste after you have rubbed it onher head; then put her on the ground. If she goes in the direction of your goodfortune, the sorcery will be successful and easy. If she goes in the oppositedirection, it will be unsuccessful.If the lizard moves towards you (south), you can expect more than ordinary goodluck; but if she moves away from you (north), the sorcery will be terriblydifficult. You may even die!So if she moves away from you, that is a good time to quit. At this point youcan make the decision to quit. If you do, you will lose your capacity to commandthe lizards, but that is better than losing your life. On the other hand, youmay decide to go ahead with the sorcery in spite of my warning. If you do, thenext step is to take the other lizard and tell her to listen to her sister’sstory, and then describe it to you.”“But how can the lizard with the sewed-up mouth tell me what she sees? Wasn’ther mouth closed to prevent her from talking?”“Sewing up her mouth prevents her from telling her story to strangers. Peoplesay lizards are talkative; they will stop anywhere to talk. Anyway, the nextstep is to smear the paste on the back of her head, and then rub her headagainst your right temple, keeping the paste away from the centre of yourforehead.At the beginning of your learning it is a good idea to tie the lizard by itsmiddle to your right shoulder with a string. Then you won’t lose her or injureher. But as you progress and become more familiar with the power of the devil’sweed, the lizards learn to obey your commands and will stay perched on yourshoulder. After you have smeared the paste on your right temple with the lizard,dip the fingers of both hands into the gruel; first rub it on both temples andthen spread it all over both sides of your head. The paste dries very fast, andcan be applied as many times as necessary. Begin every time by using thelizard’s head first and then your fingers. Sooner or later the lizard that wentto see comes back and tells her sister all about her journey, and the blindlizard describes it to you as though you were her kind. When the sorcery isfinished, put the lizard down and let her go, but don’t watch where she goes.Dig a deep hole with your bare hands and bury everything you used in it.”About 6:00 p.m. don Juan scooped the root extract out of the bowl onto a flatpiece of shale; there was less than a teaspoon of a yellowish starch. He puthalf of it into a cup and added some yellowish water. He rotated the cup in hishand to dissolve the substance. He handed me the cup and told me to drink themixture. It was tasteless, but it left a slightly bitter flavour in my mouth.The water was too hot and that annoyed me. My heart began pounding fast, butsoon I was relaxed again.Don Juan got the other bowl with the paste. The paste looked solid, and had aglossy surface. I tried to poke the crust with my finger, but don Juan jumpedtoward me and pushed my hand away from the bowl. He became very annoyed; he saidit was very thoughtless of me to try that, and if I really wanted to learn therewas no need to be careless. This was power, he said, pointing to the paste, andnobody could tell what kind of power it really was. It was bad enough that wehad to tamper with it for our own purposes—a thing we cannot help doing becausewe are men, he said—but we should at least treat it with the proper respect. Themixture looked like oatmeal. Apparently it had enough starch to give it thatconsistency. He asked me to get the bags with the lizards. He took the lizardwith the sewed-up mouth and carefully handed it over to me. He made me take itwith my left hand and told me to get some of the paste with my finger and rub iton the lizard’s head and then put the lizard into the pot and hold it thereuntil the paste covered its entire body.Then he told me to remove the lizard from the pot. He picked up the pot and ledme to a rocky area not too far from his house.He pointed to a large rock and told me to sit in front of it, as if it were myDatura plant, and, holding the lizard in front of my face, to explain to heragain what I wanted to know, and beg her to go and find the answer for me. Headvised me to tell the lizard I was sorry I had to cause her discomfort, and topromise her I would be kind to all lizards in return. And then he told me tohold her between the third and fourth fingers of my left hand, where he had oncemade a cut, and to dance around the rock doing exactly what I had done when Ireplanted the root of the devil’s weed; he asked me if I remembered all I haddone at that time. I said I did. He emphasized that everything had to be justthe same, and if I did not remember I had to wait until everything was clear inmy mind. He warned me with great urgency that if I acted too quickly, withoutdeliberation, I was going to get hurt. His last instruction was that I was toplace the lizard with the sewed-up mouth on the ground and watch where she went,so that I could determine the outcome of the experience.He said I was not to take my eyes away from the lizard, even for an instant,because it was a common trick of lizards to distract one and then dash away.It was not quite dark yet. Don Juan looked at the sky. “I will leave you alone,”he said, and walked away.I followed all his instructions and then placed the lizard on the ground. Thelizard stood motionless where I had put it. Then it looked at me, and ran to therocks towards the east and disappeared among them.I sat on the ground in front of the rock, as though I were facing my plant. Aprofound sadness overtook me. I wondered about the lizard with its sewed-upmouth. I thought of its strange journey and of how it looked at me before it ranaway. It was a weird thought, an annoying projection. In my own way I too was alizard, undergoing another strange journey. My fate was, perhaps, only to see;at that moment I felt that I would never be able to tell what I had seen. It wasvery dark by then. I could hardly see the rocks in front of me. I thought of donJuan’s words: “The twilight—there’s the crack between the worlds!”After long hesitation I began to follow the steps prescribed.The paste, though it looked like oatmeal, did not feel like oatmeal. It was verysmooth and cold. It had a peculiar, pungent smell. It produced a sensation ofcoolness on the skin and dried quickly. I rubbed my temples eleven times,without noticing any effect. I tried very carefully to take account of anychange in perception or mood, for I did not even know what to anticipate.As a matter of fact, I could not conceive the nature of the experience, and kepton searching for clues.The paste had dried up and scaled off my temples. I was about to rub some moreof it on when I realized I was sitting on my heels in Japanese fashion. I hadbeen sitting cross-legged and did not recall changing positions. It took sometime to realize fully that I was sitting on the floor in a sort of cloister withhigh arches. I thought they were brick arches, but upon examining them I sawthey were stone.This transition was very difficult. It came so suddenly that I was not ready tofollow. My perception of the elements of the vision was diffused, as if I weredreaming. Yet the components did not change. They remained steady, and I couldstop alongside any one of them and actually examine it. The vision was not soclear or so real as one induced by peyote. It had a misty character, anintensely pleasing pastel quality.I wondered whether I could get up or not, and the next thing I noticed was thatI had moved. I was at the top of a stairway andH—, a friend of mine, was standing at the bottom. Her eyes were feverish. Therewas a mad glare in them. She laughed aloud with such intensity that she wasterrifying. She began coming up the stairs. I wanted to run away or take cover,because “she’d been off her rocker once”. That was the thought that came to mymind. I hid behind a column and she went by without looking. “She’s going on along trip now,” was another thought that occurred to me then; and finally thelast thought I remembered was, “She laughs every time she’s ready to crack up.”Suddenly the scene became very clear; it was no longer like a dream. It was likean ordinary scene, but I seemed to be looking at it through window glass. Itried to touch a column but all I sensed was that I couldn’t move; yet I knew Icould stay as long as I wanted, viewing the scene. I was in it and yet I was notpart of it.I experienced a barrage of rational thoughts and arguments.I was, so far as I could judge, in an ordinary state of sober consciousness.Every element belonged in the realm of my normal processes. And yet I knew itwas not an ordinary state.The scene changed abruptly. It was night-time. I was in the hall of a building.The darkness inside the building made me aware that in the earlier scene thesunlight had been beautifully clear. Yet it had been so commonplace that I didnot notice it at the time. As I looked further into the new vision I saw a youngman coming out of a room carrying a large knapsack on his shoulders. I didn’tknow who he was, although I had seen him once or twice. He walked by me and wentdown the stairs. By then I had forgotten my apprehension, my rational dilemmas.“Who’s that guy?” I thought. “Why did I see him?”The scene changed again and I was watching the young man deface books; he gluedsome of the pages together, erased markings, and so on. Then I saw him arrangingthe books neatly in a wooden crate. There was a pile of crates. They were not inhis room, but in a storage place. Other images came to my mind, but they werenot clear. The scene became foggy. I had a sensation of spinning.Don Juan shook me by the shoulders and I woke up. He helped me to stand and wewalked back to his house. It had been three and a half hours from the moment Ibegan rubbing the paste on my temples to the time I woke up, but the visionarystate could not have lasted more than ten minutes. I had no ill effectswhatsoever. I was just hungry and sleepy.Thursday, 18 April 1963Don Juan asked me last night to describe my recent experience, but I was toosleepy to talk about it. I could not concentrate.Today, as soon as I woke up, he asked me again.“Who told you this girl H- had been off her rocker?” he asked when I finished mystory.“Nobody. It was just one of the thoughts I had.”“Do you think they were your thoughts?”I told him they were my thoughts, although I had no reason to think that H- hadbeen sick. They were strange thoughts. They seemed to pop up in my mind fromnowhere. He looked at me inquisitively. I asked him if he did not believe me; helaughed and said that it was my routine to be careless with my acts.“What did I do wrong, don Juan?”“You should have listened to the lizards.”“How should I have listened?”“The little lizard on your shoulder was describing to you everything her sisterwas seeing. She was talking to you. She was telling you everything, and you paidno attention. Instead, you believed the lizard’s words were your own thoughts.”“But they were my own thoughts, don Juan.”“They were not. That is the nature of this sorcery. Actually, the vision is tobe listened to, rather than looked at. The same thing happened to me. I wasabout to warn you when I remembered my benefactor had not warned me.”“Was your experience like mine, don Juan?”“No. Mine was a hellish journey. I nearly died.”“Why was it hellish?”“Maybe because the devil’s weed did not like me, or because I was not clearabout what I wanted to ask. Like you yesterday. You must have had that girl inmind when you asked the question about the books.”“I can’t remember it.”“The lizards are never wrong; they take every thought as a question. The lizardcame back and told you things about H- no one will ever be able to understand,because not even you know what your thoughts were.”“How about the other vision I had?”“Your thoughts must have been steady when you asked that question. And that isthe way this sorcery should be conducted, with clarity.”“Do you mean the vision of the girl is not to be taken seriously?”“How can it be taken seriously if you don’t know what questions the littlelizards were answering?”“Would it be more clear to the lizard if one asked only one question?”“Yes, that would be clearer. If you could hold one thought steadily.”“But what would happen, don Juan, if the one question was not a simple one?”“As long as your thought is steady, and does not go into other things, it isclear to the little lizards, and then their answer is clear to you.”“Can one ask more questions of the lizards as one goes along in the vision?”“No. The vision is to look at whatever the lizards are telling you. That is whyI said it is a vision to hear more than a vision to see. That is why I asked youto deal with impersonal matters.Usually, when the question is about people, your longing to touch them or talkto them is too strong, and the lizard will stop talking and the sorcery, will bedispelled. You should know much more than you do now before trying to see thingsthat concern you personally. Next time you must listen carefully. I am sure thelizards told you many, many things, but you were not listening.”Friday, 19 April 1963“What were all the things I ground for the paste, don Juan?”“Seeds of devil’s weed and the weevils that live off the seeds.The measure is one handful of each.” He cupped his right hand to show me howmuch.I asked him what would happen if one element was used by itself, without theothers. He said that such a procedure would only antagonize the devil’s weed andthe lizards. “You must not antagonize the lizards,” he said, “for the next day,during the late afternoon, you must return to the site of your plant.Speak to all lizards and ask the two that helped you in the sorcery to come outagain. Search all over until it is quite dark. If you can’t find them, you musttry it once more the next day. If you are strong you will find both of them, andthen you have to eat them, right there. And you will be endowed forever with thecapacity to see the unknown. You will never need to catch lizards again topractise this sorcery. They will live inside you from then on.”“What do I do if I find only one of them?”“If you find only one of them you must let her go at the end of your search. Ifyou find her the first day, don’t keep her, hoping you will catch the other onethe next day. That will only spoil your friendship with them.”“What happens if I can’t find them at all?”“I think that would be the best thing for you. It implies that you must catchtwo lizards every time you want their help, but it also implies that you arefree.”“What do you mean, free?”“Free from being the slave of the devil’s weed. If the lizards are to liveinside you, the devil’s weed will never let you go.”“Is that bad?”“Of course it is bad. She will cut you off from everything else. You will haveto spend your life grooming her as an ally.She is possessive. Once she dominates you, there is only one way to go—her way.”“What if I find that the lizards are dead?”“If you find one or both of them dead, you must not attempt to do this sorceryfor some time. Lay off for a while.“I think this is all I need to tell you; what I have told you is the rule.Whenever you practice this sorcery by yourself, you must follow all the steps Ihave described while you sit in front of your plant. One more thing. You mustnot eat or drink until the sorcery is finished.”6The next step in don Juan’s teachings was a new aspect of mastering the secondportion of the Datura root. In the time that elapsed between the two stages oflearning don Juan inquired only about the development of my plant.Thursday, 27 June 1963“It is a good practice to test the devil’s weed before embarking fully on herpath,” don Juan said.“How do you test her, don Juan?”“You must try another sorcery with the lizards. You have all the elements thatare needed to ask one more question of the lizards, this time without my help.”“Is it very necessary that I do this sorcery, don Juan?”“It is the best way to test the feelings of the devil’s weed towards you. Shetests you all the time, so it is only fair that you test her too, and if youfeel anywhere along her path that for some reason you should not go on, then youmust simply stop.”Saturday, 29 June 1963I brought up the subject of the devil’s weed. I wanted don Juan to tell me moreabout it, and yet I did not want to be committed to participate.“The second portion is used only to divine, isn’t that so, don Juan?” I asked tostart the conversation.“Not only to divine. One learns the sorcery of the lizards with the aid of thesecond portion, and at the same time one tests the devil’s weed; but in realitythe second portion is used for other purposes. The sorcery of the lizards isonly the beginning.”“Then what is it used for, don Juan?”He did not answer. He abruptly changed the subject, and asked me how big werethe Datura plants growing around my own plant. I made a gesture of size.Don Juan said, “I have taught you how to tell a male from a female. Now, go toyour plants and bring me both. Go first to your old plant and watch carefullythe watercourse made by the rain. By now the rain must have carried the seedsfar away.Watch the crevices [zanjitas] made by the run-off, and from them determine thedirection of the flow. Then find the plant that is growing at the farthest pointfrom your plant. All the devil’s weed plants that are growing in between areyours. Later, as they seed, you can extend the size of your territory byfollowing the watercourse from each plant along the way.”He gave me meticulous instructions on how to procure a cutting tool. The cuttingof the root, he said, had to be done in the following way. First, I had toselect the plant I was to cut and clear away the dirt around the place where theroot joined the stem. Second, I had to repeat exactly the same dance I hadperformed when I replanted the root. Third, I had to cut the stem off, and leavethe root in the ground. The final step was to dig out sixteen inches of root. Headmonished me not to talk or to betray any feeling during this act.“You should carry two pieces of cloth,” he said. “Spread them on the ground andplace the plants on them. Then cut the plants into parts and stack them up. Theorder is up to you; but you must always remember what order you used, becausethat is the way you must always do it. Bring the plants to me as soon as youhave them.”Saturday, 6 July 1963On Monday 1 July, I cut the Datura plants don Juan had asked for. I waited untilit was fairly dark to do the dancing around the plants because I did not wantanybody to see me. I felt quite apprehensive. I was sure someone was going towitness my strange acts. I had previously chosen the plants I thought were amale and a female. I had to cut off sixteen inches of the root of each one, anddigging to that depth with a wooden stick was not an easy task. It took mehours. I had to finish the job in complete darkness, and when I was ready to cutthem I had to use a flashlight. My original apprehension that somebody wouldwatch me was minimal compared with the fear that someone would spot the light inthe bushes.I took the plants to don Juan’s house on Tuesday 2 July. He opened the bundlesand examined the pieces. He said he still had to give me the seeds of hisplants. He pushed a mortar in front of me. He took a glass jar and emptied itscontents—dried seeds lumped together—into the mortar.I asked him what they were, and he said they were seeds eaten by weevils. Therewere quite a few bugs among the seeds—little black grain weevils. He said theywere special bugs, and that we had to take them out and put them into a separatejar. He handed me another jar, one-third full of the same kind of weevils.A piece of paper was stuffed into the jar to keep the weevils from escaping.“Next time you will have to use the bugs from your own plants,” don Juan said.“What you do is to cut the seedpods that have tiny holes; they are full of bugs.Open the pod and scrape everything into a jar. Collect one handful of bugs andput them into another container. Treat them rough. Don’t be considerate ordelicate with them. Measure one handful of the lumped seeds that the bugs haveeaten and one handful of the bugs” powder, and bury the rest any place in thatdirection [here he pointed southeast] from your plant. Then gather good, dryseeds and store them separately. You can gather all you want.You can always use them. It is a good idea to get the seeds out of the podsthere so that you can bury everything at once.”Next don Juan told me to grind the lumped seeds first, then the weevil eggs,then the bugs, and last the good, dry seeds.When all of them were mashed into a fine powder don Juan took the pieces ofDatura I had cut and stacked up. He separated the male root and wrapped itgently in a piece of cloth. He handed me the rest, and told me to cut everythinginto little pieces, mash them well, and then put every bit of the juice into apot. He said I had to mash them in the same order in which I had stacked themup.After I had finished he told me to measure one cup of boiling water and stir itwith everything in the pot, and then to add two more cups. He handed me asmoothly finished bone stick. I stirred the mush with it and put the pot on thefire. Then he said we had to prepare the root, and for that we had to use thelarger mortar because the male root could not be cut at all. We went to the backof the house. He had the mortar ready, and I proceeded to pound the root as Ihad done before. We left the root soaking in water, exposed to the night air,and went inside the house.I woke up when don Juan got up. The sun was shining in a clear sky. It was ahot, dry day. Don Juan commented again that he was sure the devil’s weed likedme.We proceeded to treat the root, and at the end of the day we had quite a bit ofyellowish substance in the bottom of the bowl.Don Juan poured off the top water. I thought that was the end of the procedure,but he filled the bowl with boiling water again.He brought down the pot with the mush from under the roof.The mush seemed to be almost dry. He took the pot inside the house, placed itcarefully on the floor, and sat down. Then he began to talk.“My benefactor told me it was permissible to mix the plant with lard. And thatis what you are going to do. My benefactor mixed it with lard for me, but, as Ihave already said, I never was very fond of the plant and never really tried tobecome one with her. My benefactor told me that for best results, for those whoreally want to master the power, the proper thing is to mix the plant with thelard of a wild boar. The fat of the intestines is the best. But it is for you tochoose. Perhaps the turn of the wheel will decide that you take the devil’s weedas an ally, in which case I will advise you, as my benefactor advised me, tohunt a wild boar and get the fat from the intestines [sebode tripa]. In othertimes, when the devil’s weed was tops, brujos used to go on special huntingtrips to get fat from wild boars. They sought the biggest and strongest males.They had a special magic for wild boars; they took from them a special power, sospecial that it was hard to believe, even in those days. But that power is lost.I don’t know anything about it. And I don’t know any man who knows about it.Perhaps the weed herself will teach you all that.”Don Juan measured a handful of lard, dumped it into the bowl containing the drygruel, and scraped the lard left on his hand onto the edge of the pot. He toldme to stir the contents until they were smooth and thoroughly mixed.I whipped the mixture for nearly three hours. Don Juan looked at it from time totime and thought it was not done yet.Finally he seemed satisfied. The air whipped into the paste had given it a lightgrey colour and the consistency of jelly. He hung the bowl from the roof next tothe other bowl. He said he was going to leave it there until the next daybecause it would take two days to prepare this second portion. He told me not toeat anything in the meantime. I could have water, but no food at all.The next day, Thursday 4 July, don Juan directed me to leach the root fourtimes. By the last time I poured the water out of the bowl it had already becomedark. We sat on the porch. He put both bowls in front of him. The root extractmeasured a teaspoon of a whitish starch. He put it into a cup and added water.He rotated the cup in his hand to dissolve the substance and then handed the cupto me. He told me to drink all that was in the cup. I drank it fast and then putthe cup on the floor and slumped back. My heart began pounding; I felt I couldnot breathe. Don Juan ordered me, matter-of-factly, to take off all my clothes.I asked him why, and he said I had to rub myself with the paste. I hesitated. Idid not know whether to undress.Don Juan urged me to hurry up. He said there was very little time to foolaround. I removed all my clothes.He took his bone stick and cut two horizontal lines on the surface of the paste,thus dividing the contents of the bowl into three equal parts. Then, starting atthe centre of the top line, he cut a vertical line perpendicular to the othertwo, dividing the paste into five parts. He pointed to the bottom right area,and said that was for my left foot. The area above it was for my left leg. Thetop and largest part was for my genitals. The next one below, on the left side,was for my right leg, and the area at the bottom left was for my right foot. Hetold me to apply the part of the paste designated for my left foot to the soleof my foot and rub it thoroughly. Then he guided me in applying the paste on theinside part of my whole left leg, on my genitals, down the inside of my wholeright leg, and finally on the sole of my right foot.I followed his directions. The paste was cold and had a particularly strongodour. When I had finished applying it I straightened up. The smell from themixture entered my nostrils.It was suffocating me. The pungent odour was actually choking me. It was like agas of some sort. I tried to breathe through my mouth and tried to talk to donJuan, but I couldn’t.Don Juan kept staring at me. I took a step towards him. My legs were rubbery andlong, extremely long. I took another step.My knee joints felt springy, like a vault pole; they shook and vibrated andcontracted elastically. I moved forward. The motion of my body was slow andshaky; it was more like a tremor forward and up. I looked down and saw don Juansitting below me, way below me. The momentum carried me forward one more step,which was even more elastic and longer than the preceding one. And from there Isoared. I remember coming down once; then I pushed up with both feet, sprangbackwards, and glided on my back. I saw the dark sky above me, and the cloudsgoing by me. I jerked my body so I could look down. I saw the dark mass of themountains. My speed was extraordinary.My arms were fixed, folded against my sides. My head was the directional unit.If I kept it bent backwards I made vertical circles. I changed directions byturning my head to the side. I enjoyed such freedom and swiftness as I had neverknown before.The marvellous darkness gave me a feeling of sadness, of longing, perhaps. Itwas as if I had found a place where I belonged—the darkness of the night. Itried to look around, but all I sensed was that the night was serene, and yet itheld so much power.Suddenly I knew it was time to come down; it was as if I had been given an orderI had to obey. And I began descending like a feather with lateral motions. Thattype of movement made me very ill. It was slow and jerky, as though I were beinglowered by pulleys. I got sick. My head was bursting with the most excruciatingpain. A kind of blackness enveloped me. I was very aware of the feeling of beingsuspended in it.The next thing I remember is the feeling of waking up. I was in my bed in my ownroom. I sat up. And the image of my room dissolved. I stood up. I was naked! Themotion of standing made me sick again.I recognized some of the landmarks. I was about half a mile from don Juan’shouse, near the place of his Datura plants. Suddenly everything fitted intoplace, and I realized that I would have to walk all the way back to his house,naked. To be deprived of clothes was a profound psychological disadvantage, butthere was nothing I could do to solve the problem. I thought of making myself askirt with branches, but the thought seemed ludicrous and, besides, it was soongoing to be dawn, for the morning twilight was already clear. I forgot about mydiscomfort and my nausea and started to walk towards the house. I was obsessedwith the fear of being discovered. I watched for people and dogs. I tried torun, but I hurt my feet on the small, sharp stones. I walked slowly. It wasalready very clear. Then I saw somebody coming up the road, and I quickly jumpedbehind the bushes. My situation seemed so incongruous to me. A moment before Ihad been enjoying the unbelievable pleasure of flying; the next minute I foundmyself hiding, embarrassed by my own nakedness. I thought of jumping out on theroad again and running with all my might past the person who was coming.I thought he would be so startled that by the time he realized it was a nakedman I would have left him far behind. I thought all that, but I did not dare tomove.The person coming up the road was just upon me and stopped walking. I heard himcalling my name. It was don Juan, and he had my clothes. As I put them on helooked at me and laughed; he laughed so hard that I wound up laughing too.The same day, Friday 5 July, late in the afternoon, don Juan asked me to narratethe details of my experience. As carefully as I could, I related the wholeepisode.“The second portion of the devil’s weed is used to fly,” he said when I hadfinished. “The unguent by itself is not enough. My benefactor said that it isthe root that gives direction and wisdom, and it is the cause of flying. As youlearn more, and take it often in order to fly, you will begin to see everythingwith great clarity.You can soar through the air for hundreds of miles to see what is happening atany place you want, or to deliver a fatal blow to your enemies far away. As youbecome familiar with the devil’s weed, she will teach you how to do such things.For instance, she has taught you already how to change directions. In the samemanner, she will teach you unimaginable things.”“Like what, don Juan?”“That I can’t tell you. Every man is different. My benefactor never told me whathe had learned. He told me how to proceed, but never what he saw. That is onlyfor oneself.”“But I tell you all I see, don Juan.”“Now you do. Later you will not. The next time you take the devil’s weed youwill do it by yourself, around your own plants, because that is where you willland, around your plants. Remember that. That is why I came down here to myplants to look for you.”He said nothing more, and I fell asleep. When I woke up in the evening, I feltinvigorated. For some reason I exuded a sort of physical contentment. I washappy, satisfied.Don Juan asked me, “Did you like the night? Or was it frightful?”I told him that the night was truly magnificent.“How about your headache? Was it very bad?” he asked.“The headache was as strong as all the other feelings. It was the worst pain Ihave ever had,” I said.“Would that keep you from wanting to taste the power of the devil’s weed again?”“I don’t know. I don’t want it now, but later I might. I really don’t know, donJuan.”There was a question I wanted to ask him. I knew he was going to evade it, so Iwaited for him to mention the subject;I waited all day. Finally, before I left that evening, I had to ask him, “Did Ireally fly, don Juan?”“That is what you told me. Didn’t you?”“I know, don Juan. I mean, did my body fly? Did I take off like a bird?”“You always ask me questions I cannot answer. You flew.That is what the second portion of the devil’s weed is for. As you take more ofit, you will learn how to fly perfectly. It is not a simple matter. A man flieswith the help of the second portion of the devil’s weed. That is all I can tellyou. What you want to know makes no sense. Birds fly like birds and a man whohas taken the devil’s weed flies as such [el enyerbado vuela asi].”“As birds do? [¿Asi como los pajaros?].”“No, he flies as a man who has taken the weed [No, asi como los enyerbados].”“Then I didn’t really fly, don Juan. I flew in my imagination, in my mind alone.Where was my body?”“In the bushes,” he replied cuttingly, but immediately broke into laughteragain. “The trouble with you is that you understand things in only one way. Youdon’t think a man flies; and yet a brujo can move a thousand miles in one secondto see what is going on. He can deliver a blow to his enemies long distancesaway. So, does he or doesn’t he fly?”“You see, don Juan, you and I are differently oriented. Suppose, for the sake ofargument, one of my fellow students had been here with me when I took thedevil’s weed. Would he have been able to see me flying?”“There you go again with your questions about what would happen if . . . It isuseless to talk that way. If your friend, or anybody else, takes the secondportion of the weed all he can do is fly. Now, if he had simply watched you, hemight have seen you flying, or he might not. That depends on the man.”“But what I mean, don Juan, is that if you and I look at a bird and see it fly,we agree that it is flying. But if two of my friends had seen me flying as I didlast night, would they have agreed that I was flying?”“Well, they might have. You agree that birds fly because you have seen themflying. Flying is a common thing with birds. But you will not agree on otherthings birds do, because you have never seen birds doing them. If your friendsknew about men flying with the devil’s weed, then they would agree.”“Let’s put it another way, don Juan. What I meant to say is that if I had tiedmyself to a rock with a heavy chain I would have flown just the same, because mybody had nothing to do with my flying.”Don Juan looked at me incredulously. “If you tie yourself to a rock,” he said,“I’m afraid you will have to fly holding the rock with its heavy chain.”7Collecting the ingredients and preparing them for the smoke mixture formed ayearly cycle. The first year don Juan taught me the procedure. In December of1962, the second year, when the cycle was renewed, don Juan merely directed me;I collected the ingredients myself, prepared them, and put them away until thenext year.In December 1963, a new cycle started for the third time. Don Juan then showedme how to combine the dried ingredients I had collected and prepared the yearbefore. He put the smoking mixture into a small leather bag, and we set out onceagain to collect the different components for the following year.Don Juan seldom mentioned the “little smoke” during the year that elapsedbetween the two gatherings. Every time I went to see him, however, he gave mehis pipe to hold, and the procedure of “getting familiar” with the pipedeveloped in the way he had described. He put the pipe in my hands verygradually.He demanded absolute and careful concentration on that action, and gave me veryexplicit directions. Any fumbling with the pipe would inevitably result in hisor my death, he said.As soon as we had finished the third collecting and preparing cycle, don Juanbegan to talk about the smoke as an ally for the first time in more than a year.Monday, 23 December 1963We were driving back to his house after collecting some yellow flowers for themixture. They were one of the necessary ingredients. I made the remark that thisyear we did not follow the same order in collecting the ingredients as we hadthe year before. He laughed and said the smoke was not moody or petty, as thedevil’s weed was. For the smoke, the order of collecting was unimportant; allthat was required was that the man using the mixture had to be accurate andexact.I asked don Juan what we were going to do with the mixture he had prepared andgiven me to keep. He replied that it was mine, and added that I had to use it assoon as possible. I asked how much of it was needed each time. The small bag hehad given me contained approximately three times the amount a small tobacco bagwould hold. He told me I would have to use all the contents of my bag in oneyear, and how much I needed each time I smoked was a personal matter.I wanted to know what would happen if I never finished the bag. Don Juan saidthat nothing would happen; the smoke did not require anything. He himself didnot need to smoke any more, and yet he made a new mixture each year. He thencorrected himself and said that he rarely had to smoke. I asked what he did withthe unused mixture, but he did not answer. He said the mixture was no longergood if not used in one year.At this point we got into a long argument. I did not phrase my questionscorrectly and his answers seemed confusing. I wanted to know if the mixturewould lose its hallucinogenic properties, or power, after a year, thus makingthe yearly cycle necessary; but he insisted that the mixture would not lose itspower at any time. The only thing that happened, he said, was that a man did notneed it any more because he had made a new supply; he had to dispose of theremaining old mixture in a specific way, which don Juan did not want to revealto me at that point.Tuesday, 24 December 1963“You said, don Juan, you don’t have to smoke any more.”“Yes, because the smoke is my ally I don’t need to smoke any more. I can callhim any time, any place.”“Do you mean he comes to you even if you do not smoke?”“I mean I go to him freely.”“Will I be able to do that, too?”“If you succeed in getting him as your ally, you will.”Tuesday, 31 December 1963On Thursday 26 December I had my first experience with don Juan’s ally, thesmoke. All day I drove him around and did chores for him. We returned to hishouse in the late afternoon. I mentioned that we had had nothing to eat all day.He was completely unconcerned over that; instead he began to tell me it wasimperative for me to become familiar with the smoke. He said I had to experienceit myself to realize how important it was as an ally.Without giving me an opportunity to say anything, don Juan told me he was goingto light his pipe for me, right then. I tried to dissuade him, arguing that Idid not believe I was ready. I told him I felt I had not handled the pipe for along enough time. But he said there was not much time left for me to learn, andI had to use the pipe very soon. He brought the pipe out of its sack and fondledit. I sat on the floor next to him and frantically tried to get sick and passout—to do anything to put off this unavoidable step.The room was almost dark. Don Juan had lighted the kerosene lamp and placed itin a corner. Usually the lamp kept the room in a relaxing semi-darkness, itsyellowish light always soothing. This time, however, the light seemed dim andunusually red; it was unnerving. He untied his small bag of mixture withoutremoving it from the cord fastened around his neck. He brought the pipe close tohim, put it inside his shirt, and poured some of the mixture into the bowl. Hemade me watch the procedure, pointing out that if some of the mixture spilled itwould fall inside his shirt.Don Juan filled three-fourths of the bowl, then tied the bag with one hand whileholding the pipe in the other. He picked up a small clay dish, handed it to me,and asked me to get some small charcoals from the fire outside. I went to theback of the house and scooped a bunch of charcoals from the adobe stove. Ihurried back to his room. I felt deep anxiety. It was like a premonition.I sat next to don Juan and gave him the dish. He looked at it and calmly saidthe charcoals were too big. He wanted smaller ones that would fit inside thepipe bowl. I went back to the stove and got some. He took the new dish ofcharcoals and put it before him. He was sitting with his legs crossed and tuckedunder him. He glanced at me out of the corner of his eye and leaned forwarduntil his chin nearly touched the charcoals. He held the pipe in his left hand,and with an extremely swift movement of his right hand picked up a burning pieceof charcoal and put it into the bowl of the pipe; then he sat up straight and,holding the pipe with both hands, put it to his mouth and puffed three times.He stretched his arms to me and told me in a forceful whisper to take the pipewith both hands and smoke.The thought of refusing the pipe and running away crossed my mind for aninstant; but don Juan demanded again—still in a whisper—that I take the pipe andsmoke. I looked at him. His eyes were fixed on me. But his stare was friendly,concerned. It was clear that I had made the choice a long time before; there wasno alternative but to do what he said.I took the pipe and nearly dropped it. It was hot! I put it to my mouth withextreme care because I imagined its heat would be intolerable on my lips. But Ifelt no heat at all.Don Juan told me to inhale. The smoke flowed into my mouth, and seemed tocirculate there. It was heavy! I felt as though I had a mouthful of dough. Thesimile occurred to me although I had never had a mouthful of dough. The smokewas also like menthol, and the inside of my mouth suddenly became cold. It was arefreshing sensation. “Again! Again!” I heard don Juan whispering. I felt thesmoke seep inside my body freely, almost without my control. I needed no moreurging from don Juan. Mechanically I kept inhaling.Suddenly don Juan leaned over and took the pipe from my hands. He tapped theashes gently on the dish with the charcoals, then he wet his finger with salivaand rotated it inside the bowl to clean its sides. He blew through the stemrepeatedly. I saw him put the pipe back into its sheath. His actions held myinterest.When he had finished cleaning the pipe and putting it away, he stared at me, andI realized for the first time that my whole body was numb, mentholated. My facefelt heavy and my jaws hurt. I could not keep my mouth closed, but there was nosaliva flow. My mouth was burning dry, and yet I was not thirsty. I began tosense an unusual heat all over my head. A cold heat!My breath seemed to cut my nostrils and upper lip every time I exhaled. But itdidn’t burn; it hurt like a piece of ice.Don Juan sat next to me, to my right, and without moving held the pipe sheathagainst the floor as though keeping it down by force. My hands were heavy. Myarms sagged, pulling my shoulders down. My nose was running. I wiped it with theback of my hand, and my upper lip was rubbed off! I wiped my face, and all theflesh was wiped off! I was melting! I felt as if my flesh was actually melting.I jumped to my feet and tried to grab hold of something—anything—with which tosupport myself. I was experiencing a terror I had never felt before. I held ontoa pole that don Juan keeps stuck on the floor in the centre of his room. I stoodthere for a moment, then I turned to look at him.He was still sitting motionless, holding his pipe, staring at me.My breath was painfully hot (or cold?). It was choking me. I bent my headforward to rest it on the pole, but apparently I missed it, and my head kept onmoving downward beyond the point where the pole was. I stopped when I was nearlydown to the floor. I pulled myself up. The pole was there in front of my eyes! Itried again to rest my head on it. I tried to control myself and to be aware,and kept my eyes open as I leaned forward to touch the pole with my forehead. Itwas a few inches from my eyes, but as I put my head against it I had thequeerest feeling that I was going right through it.In a desperate search for a rational explanation I concluded that my eyes weredistorting depth, and that the pole must have been ten feet away, even though Isaw it directly in front of my face. I then conceived a logical, rational way tocheck the position of the pole. I began moving sideways around it, one littlestep at a time. My argument was that in walking around the pole in that way Icouldn’t possibly make a circle more than five feet in diameter; if the pole wasreally ten feet away from me, or beyond my reach, a moment would come when Iwould have my back to it. I trusted that at that moment the pole would vanish,because in reality it would be behind me.I then proceeded to circle the pole, but it remained in front of my eyes as Iwent around it. In a fit of frustration I grabbed it with both hands, but myhands went through it. I was grabbing the air. I carefully calculated thedistance between the pole and myself. I figured it must be three feet. That is,my eyes perceived it as three feet. I played for a moment with the perception ofdepth by moving my head from one side to the other, focusing each eye in turn onthe pole and then on the background. According to my way of judging depth, thepole was unmistakably before me, possibly three feet away. Stretching out myarms to protect my head, I charged with all my strength. The sensation was thesame—I went through the pole. This time I went all the way to the floor. I stoodup again. And standing up was perhaps the most unusual of all the acts Iperformed that night. I thought myself up! In order to get up I did not use mymuscles and skeletal frame in the way I am accustomed to doing, because I nolonger had control over them. I knew it the instant I hit the ground. But mycuriosity about the pole was so strong I “thought myself up” in a kind of reflexaction. And before I fully realized I could not move, I was up.I called to don Juan for help. At one moment I yelled frantically at the top ofmy voice, but don Juan did not move. He kept on looking at me, sideways, asthough he didn’t want to turn his head to face me fully. I took a step towardhim, but instead of moving forward I staggered backward and fell against thewall. I knew I had rammed against it with my back, yet it did not feel hard; Iwas completely suspended in a soft, spongy substance—it was the wall. My armswere stretched out laterally, and slowly my whole body seemed to sink into thewall. I could only look forward into the room. Don Juan was still watching me,but he made no move to help me. I made a supreme effort to jerk my body out ofthe wall, but it only sank deeper and deeper.In the midst of indescribable terror, I felt that the spongy wall was closing inon my face. I tried to shut my eyes but they were fixed open.I don’t remember what else happened. Suddenly don Juan was in front of me, ashort distance away. We were in the other room. I saw his table and the dirtstove with the fire burning, and with the comer of my eye I distinguished thefence outside the house. I could see everything very clearly. Don Juan hadbrought the kerosene lantern and hung it from the beam in the middle of theroom. I tried to look in a different direction, but my eyes were set to see onlystraight forward. I couldn’t distinguish, or feel, any pan of my body. Mybreathing was undetectable. But my thoughts were extremely lucid. I was clearlyaware of whatever was taking place in front of me. Don Juan walked towards me,and my clarity of mind ended. Something seemed to stop inside me. There were nomore thoughts. I saw don Juan coming and I hated him. I wanted to tear himapart. I could have killed him then, but I could not move. At first I vaguelysensed a pressure on my head, but it also disappeared. There was only one thingleft—an overwhelming anger at don Juan. I saw him only a few inches from me. Iwanted to claw him apart. I felt I was groaning. Something in me began toconvulse. I heard don Juan talking to me. His voice was soft and soothing, and,I felt, infinitely pleasing. He came even closer and started to recite a Spanishlullaby.“Lady Saint Ana, why does the baby cry? For an apple he has lost. I will giveyou one. I will give you two. One for the boy and one for you [?Senora SantaAna, porque llora el nino? Por una manzana que se le ha perdido. Yo le dare una.Yo le dare dos.Una para el nino y otra para vos]” A warmth pervaded me. It was a warmth ofheart and feelings. Don Juan’s words were a distant echo. They recalled theforgotten memories of childhood.The violence I had felt before disappeared. The resentment changed into alonging—a joyous affection for don Juan. He said I must struggle not to fallasleep; that I no longer had a body and was free to turn into anything I wanted.He stepped back.My eyes were at a normal level as though I were standing in front of him. Heextended both his arms towards me and told me to come inside them.Either I moved forward, or he came closer to me. His hands were almost on myface—on my eyes, although I did not feel them. “Get inside my chest,” I heardhim say. I felt I was engulfing him. It was the same sensation of the sponginessof the wall.Then I could hear only his voice commanding me to look and see. I could notdistinguish him any more. My eyes were apparently open for I saw flashes oflight on a red field; it was as though I was looking at a light through myclosed eyelids. Then my thoughts were turned on again. They came back in a fastbarrage of images—faces, scenery. Scenes without any coherence popped up anddisappeared. It was like a fast dream in which images overlap and change. Thenthe thoughts began to diminish in number and intensity, and soon they were goneagain. There was only an awareness of affection, of being happy. I couldn’tdistinguish any shapes or light. All of a sudden I was pulled up.I distinctly felt I was being lifted. And I was free, moving with tremendouslightness and speed in water or air. I swam like an eel; I contorted and twistedand soared up and down at will. I felt a cold wind blowing all around me, and Ibegan to float like a feather back and forth, down, and down, and down.Saturday, 28 December 1963I woke up yesterday late in the afternoon. Don Juan told me I had sleptpeacefully for nearly two days. I had a splitting headache. I drank some waterand got sick. I felt tired, extremely tired, and after eating I went back tosleep.Today I felt perfectly relaxed again. Don Juan and I talked about my experiencewith the little smoke. Thinking that he wanted me to tell the whole story theway I always did, I began to describe my impressions, but he stopped me and saidit was not necessary. He told me I had really not done anything, and that I hadfallen asleep right away, so there was nothing to talk about.“How about the way I felt? Isn’t that important at all?” I insisted.“No, not with the smoke. Later on, when you learn how to travel, we will talk;when you learn how to get into things.“Does one really «get into» things?”“Don’t you remember? You went into and through that wall.”“I think I really went out of my mind.”“No, you didn’t.”“Did you behave the same way I did when you smoked for the first time, donJuan?”“No, it wasn’t the same. We have different characters.”“How did you behave?”Don Juan did not answer. I rephrased the question and asked it again. But hesaid he did not remember his experiences, and that my question was comparable toasking a fisherman how he felt the first time he fished.He said the smoke as an ally was unique, and I reminded him that he had alsosaid Mescalito was unique. He argued that each was unique, but that theydiffered in quality.“Mescalito is a protector because he talks to you and can guide your acts,” hesaid. “Mescalito teaches the right way to live. And you can see him because heis outside you. The smoke, on the other hand, is an ally. It transforms you andgives you power without ever showing its presence. You can’t talk to it. But youknow it exists because it takes your body away and makes you as light as air.Yet you never see it. But it is there giving you power to accomplishunimaginable things, such as when it takes your body away.”“I really felt I had lost my body, don Juan.”“You did.”“You mean, I really didn’t have a body?”“What do you think yourself?”“Well, I don’t know. All I can tell you is what I felt.”“That is all there is in reality—what you felt.”“But how did you see me, don Juan? How did I appear to you?”“How I saw you does not matter. It is like the time when you grabbed the pole.You felt it was not there and you went around it to make sure it was there. Butwhen you jumped at it you felt again that it was not really there.”“But you saw me as I am now, didn’t you?”“No! You were NOT as you are now!”“True! I admit that. But I had my body, didn’t I, although I couldn’t feel it?”“No! Goddammit! You did not have a body like the body you have today!”“What happened to my body then?”“I thought you understood. The little smoke took your body.”“But where did it go?”“How in hell do you expect me to know that?”It was useless to persist in trying to get a “rational” explanation. I told himI did not want to argue or to ask stupid questions, but if I accepted the ideathat it was possible to lose my body I would lose all my rationality.He said that I was exaggerating, as usual, and that I did not, nor was I goingto, lose anything because of the little smoke.Tuesday, 28 January 1964I asked don Juan what he thought of the idea of giving the smoke to anyone whowanted the experience.He indignantly replied that to give the smoke to anyone would be just the sameas killing him, for he would have no one to guide him. I asked don Juan toexplain what he meant. He said I was there, alive and talking to him, because hehad brought me back.He had restored my body. Without him I would never have awakened.“How did you restore my body, don Juan?”“You will learn that later, but you will have to learn to do it all by yourself.That is the reason I want you to learn as much as you can while I am stillaround. You have wasted enough time asking stupid questions about nonsense. Butperhaps it is not in your destiny to learn all about the little smoke.”“Well, what shall I do, then?”“Let the smoke teach you as much as you can learn.”“Does the smoke also teach?”“Of course it teaches.”“Does it teach as Mescalito does?”“No, it is not a teacher as Mescalito is. It does not show the same things.”“But what does the smoke teach, then?”“It shows you how to handle its power, and to learn that you must take it asmany times as you can.”“Your ally is very frightening, don Juan. It was unlike anything I everexperienced before. I thought I had lost my mind.”For some reason this was the most poignant image that came to my mind. I viewedthe total event from the peculiar stand of having had other hallucinogenicexperiences from which to draw a comparison, and the only thing that occurred tome, over and over again, was that with the smoke one loses one’s mind.Don Juan discarded my simile, saying that what I felt was its unimaginablepower. And to handle that power, he said, one has to live a strong life. Theidea of the strong life not only pertains to the preparation period, but alsoentails the attitude of the man after the experience. He said the smoke is sostrong one can match it only with strength; otherwise, one’s life would beshattered to bits.I asked him if the smoke had the same effect on everyone. He said it produced atransformation, but not in everyone.“Then, what is the special reason the smoke produced the transformation in me?”I asked.“That, I think, is a very silly question. You have followed obediently everystep required. It is no mystery that the smoke transformed you.”I asked him again to tell me about my appearance. I wanted to know how I looked,for the image of a bodiless being he had planted in my mind was understandablyunbearable.He said that to tell the truth he was afraid to look at me; he felt the same wayhis benefactor must have felt when he saw don Juan smoking for the first time.“Why were you afraid? Was I that frightening?” I asked.“I had never seen anyone smoking before.”“Didn’t you see your benefactor smoke?”“No.”“You have never seen even yourself?”“How could I?”“You could smoke in front of a mirror.”He did not answer, but stared at me and shook his head. I asked him again if itwas possible to look into a mirror. He said it would be possible, although itwould be useless because one would probably die of fright, if of nothing else.I said, “Then one must look frightful.”“I have wondered all my life about the same thing,” he said.“Yet I did not ask, nor did I look into a mirror. I did not even think of that.”“How can I find out then?”“You will have to wait, the same way I did, until you give the smoke to someoneelse—if you ever master it, of course. Then you will see how a man looks. Thatis the rule.”“What would happen if I smoked in front of a camera and took a picture ofmyself?”“I don’t know. The smoke would probably turn against you.But I suppose you find it so harmless you feel you can play with it.”I told him I did not mean to play, but that he had told me before that the smokedid not require steps, and I thought there would be no harm in wanting to knowhow one looked. He corrected me, saying that he had meant there was no necessityto follow a specific order, as there is with the devil’s weed; all that wasneeded with the smoke was the proper attitude, he said.From that point of view one had to be exact in following the rule. He gave me anexample, explaining that it did not matter what ingredient for the mixture waspicked first, so long as the amount was correct.I asked if there would be any harm in my telling others about my experience. Hereplied that the only secrets never to be revealed were how to make the mixture,how to move around, and how to return; other matters concerning the subject wereof no importance.8My last encounter with Mescalito was a cluster of four sessions which took placewithin four consecutive days. Don Juan called this long session a mitote. It wasa peyote ceremony for peyoteros and apprentices. There were two older men, aboutdon Juan’s age, one of whom was the leader, and five younger men includingmyself.The ceremony took place in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, near the Texasborder. It consisted of singing and of ingesting peyote during the night. In thedaytime women attendants; who stayed outside the confines of the ceremony site,supplied each man with water, and only a token of ritual food was consumed eachday.Saturday, 12 September 1964During the first night of the ceremony, Thursday 3 September,I took eight peyote buttons. They had no effect on me, or if they did, it was avery slight one. I kept my eyes closed most of the night. I felt much betterthat way. I did not fall asleep, nor was I tired. At the very end of the sessionthe singing became extraordinary. For a brief moment I felt uplifted and wantedto weep, but as the song ended the feeling vanished.We all got up and went outside. The women gave us water.Some of the men gargled it; others drank it. The men did not talk at all, butthe women chatted and giggled all day long. The ritual food was served atmidday. It was cooked corn.At sundown on Friday 4 September, the second session began.The leader sang his peyote song, and the cycle of songs and intake of peyotebuttons began once again. It ended in the morning with each man singing his ownsong, in unison with the others.When I went out I did not see as many women as had been there the day before.Someone gave me water, but I was no longer concerned with my surroundings. I hadingested eight buttons again, but the effect had been different.It must have been towards the end of the session that the singing was greatlyaccelerated, with everybody singing at once. I perceived that something orsomebody outside the house wanted to come in. I couldn’t tell whether thesinging was done to prevent “it” from bursting in, or to lure it inside.I was the only one who did not have a song. They all seemed to look at mequestioningly, especially the young men. I grew embarrassed and closed my eyes.Then I realized I could perceive what was going on much better if I kept my eyesclosed. This idea held my undivided attention. I closed my eyes, and saw the menin front of me. I opened my eyes, and the image was unchanged. The surroundingswere exactly the same for me, whether my eyes were open or closed.Suddenly everything vanished, or crumbled, and there emerged in its place themanlike figure of Mescalito I had seen two years before. He was sitting somedistance away with his profile towards me. I stared fixedly at him, but he didnot look at me; not once did he turn.I believed I was doing something wrong, something that kept him away. I got upand walked towards him to ask him about it.But the act of moving dispelled the image. It began to fade, and the figures ofthe men I was with were superimposed upon it.Again I heard the loud, frantic singing.I went into the nearby bushes and walked for a while. Everything stood out veryclearly. I noticed I was seeing in the darkness, but it mattered very littlethis time. The important point was, why did Mescalito avoid me?I returned to join the group, and as I was about to enter the house I heard aheavy rumbling and felt a tremor. The ground shook. It was the same noise I hadheard in the peyote valley two years before.I ran into the bushes again. I knew that Mescalito was there, and that I wasgoing to find him. But he was not there. I waited until morning, and joined theothers just before the session ended.The usual procedure was repeated on the third day. I was not tired, but I sleptduring the afternoon.In the evening of Saturday 5 September, the old man sang his peyote song tostart the cycle once more. During this session I chewed only one button and didnot listen to any of the songs, nor did I pay attention to anything that wenton. From the first moment my whole being was uniquely concentrated on one point.I knew something terribly important for my well-being was missing.While the men sang I asked Mescalito, in a loud voice, to teach me a song. Mypleading mingled with the men’s loud singing.Immediately I heard a song in my ears. I turned around and sat with my back tothe group and listened. I heard the words and the tune over and over, and Irepeated them until I had learned the whole song. It was a long song in Spanish.Then I sang it to the group several times. And soon afterwards a new song cameto my ears. By morning I had sung both songs countless times. I felt I had beenrenewed, fortified.After the water was given to us, don Juan gave me a bag, and we all went intothe hills. It was a long, strenuous walk to a low mesa. There I saw severalpeyote plants. But for some reason I did not want to look at them. After we hadcrossed the mesa, the group broke up. Don Juan and I walked back, collectingpeyote buttons just as we had done the first time I helped him.We returned in the late afternoon of Sunday 6 September.In the evening the leader opened the cycle again. Nobody had said a word but Iknew perfectly well it was the last gathering.This time the old man sang a new song. A sack with fresh peyote buttons waspassed around. This was the first time I had tasted a fresh button. It was pulpybut hard to chew. It resembled a hard, green fruit, and was sharper and morebitter than the dried buttons. Personally, I found the fresh peyote infinitelymore alive.I chewed fourteen buttons. I counted them carefully. I did not finish the lastone, for I heard the familiar rumble that marked the presence of Mescalito.Everybody sang frantically, and I knew that don Juan, and everybody else, hadactually heard the noise. I refused to think that their reaction was a responseto a cue given by one of them merely to deceive me.At that moment I felt a great surge of wisdom engulfing me. A conjecture I hadplayed with for three years turned then into a certainty. It had taken me threeyears to realize, or rather to find out, that whatever is contained in thecactus Lophophora williamsii had nothing to do with me in order to exist as anentity; it existed by itself out there, at large. I knew it then.I sang feverishly until I could no longer voice the words. I felt as if my songswere inside my body, shaking me uncontrollably.I needed to go out and find Mescalito, or I would explode. I walked towards thepeyote field. I kept on singing my songs. I knew they were individually mine—theunquestionable proof of my singleness. I sensed each one of my steps. Theyresounded on the ground; their echo produced the indescribable euphoria of beinga man.Each one of the peyote plants on the field shone with a bluish, scintillatinglight. One plant had a very bright light. I sat in front of it and sang my songsto it. As I sang Mescalito came out of the plant—the same manlike figure I hadseen before. He looked at me. With great audacity, for a person of mytemperament, I sang to him. There was a sound of flutes, or of wind, a familiarmusical vibration. He seemed to have said, as he had two years before, “ What doyou want?”I spoke very loudly. I said that I knew there was something amiss in my life andin my actions, but I could not find out what it was. I begged him to tell mewhat was wrong with me, and also to tell me his name so that I could call himwhen I needed him. He looked at me, elongated his mouth like a trumpet until itreached my ear, and then told me his name.Suddenly I saw my own father standing in the middle of the peyote field; but thefield had vanished and the scene was my old home, the home of my childhood. Myfather and I were standing by a fig tree. I embraced my father and hurriedlybegan to tell him things I had never before been able to say. Every one of mythoughts was concise and to the point. It was as if we had no time, really, andI had to say everything at once. I said staggering things about my feelingstowards him, things I would never have been able to voice under ordinarycircumstances.My father did not speak. He just listened and then was pulled, or sucked, away.I was alone again. I wept with remorse and sadness.I walked through the peyote field calling the name Mescalito had taught me.Something emerged from a strange, starlike light on a peyote plant. It was along shiny object—a stick of light the size of a man. For a moment itilluminated the whole field with an intense yellowish or amber light; then itlit up the whole sky above, creating a portentous, marvellous sight. I thought Iwould go blind if I kept on looking; I covered my eyes and buried my head in myarms.I had a clear notion that Mescalito told me to eat one more peyote button. Ithought, “I can’t do that because I have no knife to cut it.”“Eat one from the ground,” he said to me in the same strange way.I lay on my stomach and chewed the top of a plant. It kindled me. It filledevery corner of my body with warmth and directness. Everything was alive.Everything had exquisite and intricate detail, and yet everything was so simple.I was everywhere; I could see up and down and around, all at the same time.This particular feeling lasted long enough for me to become aware of it. Then itchanged into an oppressive terror, terror that did not come upon me abruptly,but somehow swiftly. At first my marvellous world of silence was jolted by sharpnoises, but I was not concerned. Then the noises became louder and wereuninterrupted, as if they were closing in on me. And gradually I lost thefeeling of floating in a world undifferentiated, indifferent, and beautiful. Thenoises became gigantic steps.Something enormous was breathing and moving around me. I believed it was huntingfor me.I ran and hid under a boulder, and tried to determine from there what wasfollowing me. At one moment I crept out of my hiding place to look, and whoeverwas my pursuer came upon me. It was like sea kelp. It threw itself on me. Ithought its weight was going to crush me, but I found myself inside a pipe or acavity. I clearly saw that the kelp had not covered all the ground surfacearound me. There remained a bit of free ground underneath the boulder. I beganto crawl underneath it. I saw huge drops of liquid falling from the kelp. I“knew” it was secreting digestive acid in order to dissolve me. A drop fell onmy arm; I tried to rub off the acid with dirt, and applied saliva to it as Ikept on digging. At one point I was almost vaporous. I was being pushed uptowards a light. I thought the kelp had dissolved me. I vaguely detected a lightwhich grew brighter; it was pushing from under the ground until finally iterupted into what I recognized as the sun coming out from behind the mountains.Slowly I began to regain my usual sensorial processes. I lay on my stomach withmy chin on my folded arm. The peyote plant in front of me began to light upagain, and before I could move my eyes the long light emerged again. It hoveredover me. I sat up. The light touched my whole body with quiet strength, and thenrolled away out of sight.I ran all the way to the place where the other men were. We all returned totown. Don Juan and I stayed one more day with don Roberto, the peyote leader. Islept all the time we were there.When we were about to leave, the young men who had taken part in the peyotesessions came up to me. They embraced me one by one, and laughed shyly. Each oneof them introduced himself. I talked with them for hours about everything exceptthe peyote meetings.Don Juan said it was time to leave. The young men embraced me again. “Comeback,” one of them said. “We are already waiting for you,” another one added. Idrove away slowly trying to see the older men, but none of them was there.Thursday, 10 September 1964To tell don Juan about an experience always forced me to recall it step by step,to the best of my ability. This seemed to be the only way to remembereverything.Today I told him the details of my last encounter with Mescalito. He listened tomy story attentively up to the point whenMescalito told me his name. Don Juan interrupted me there.“You are on your own now,” he said. “The protector has accepted you. I will beof very little help to you from now on. You don’t have to tell me anything moreabout your relationship with him. You know his name now; and neither his name,nor his dealings with you, should ever be mentioned to a living being.”I insisted that I wanted to tell him all the details of the experience, becauseit made no sense to me. I told him I needed his assistance to interpret what Ihad seen. He said I could do that by myself, that it was better for me to startthinking on my own. I argued that I was interested in hearing his opinionsbecause it would take me too long to arrive at my own, and I did not know how toproceed.I said, “Take the songs for instance. What do they mean?”“Only you can decide that,” he said. “How could I know what they mean? Theprotector alone can tell you that, just as he alone can teach you his songs. IfI were to tell you what they mean, it would be the same as if you learnedsomeone else’s songs.”“What do you mean by that, don Juan?”“You can tell who are the phonies by listening to people singing the protector’ssongs. Only the songs with soul are his and were taught by him. The others arecopies of other men’s songs.People are sometimes as deceitful as that. They sing someone else’s songswithout even knowing what the songs say.”I said that I had meant to ask for what purpose the songs were used. He answeredthat the songs I had learned were for calling the protector, and that I shouldalways use them in conjunction with his name to call him. Later Mescalito wouldprobably teach me other songs for other purposes, don Juan said.I asked him then if he thought the protector had accepted me fully. He laughedas if my question were foolish. He said the protector had accepted me and hadmade sure I knew that he had accepted me by showing himself to me as a light,twice. Don Juan seemed to be very impressed by the fact that I had seen thelight twice. He emphasized that aspect of my encounter withMescalito.I told him I could not understand how it was possible to be accepted by theprotector, yet terrified by him at the same time.He did not answer for a very long time. He seemed bewildered.Finally he said, “It is so clear. What he wanted is so clear that I don’t seehow you can misunderstand.”“Everything is still incomprehensible to me, don Juan.”“It takes time really to see and understand what Mescalito means; you shouldthink about his lessons until they become clear.”Friday, 11 September 1964Again I insisted upon having don Juan interpret my visionary experiences. Hestalled for a while. Then he spoke as if we had already been carrying on aconversation about Mescalito.“Do you see how stupid it is to ask if he is like a person you can talk to?” donJuan said. “He is like nothing you have ever seen. He is like a man, but at thesame time he is not at all like one. It is difficult to explain that to peoplewho know nothing about him and want to know everything about him all at once.And then, his lessons are as mysterious as he is himself. No man, to myknowledge, can predict his acts. You ask him a question and he shows you theway, but he does not tell you about it in the same manner you and I talk to eachother. Do you understand now what he does?”“I don’t think I have trouble understanding that. What I can’t figure out is hismeaning.”“You asked him to tell you what’s wrong with you, and he gave you the fullpicture. There can be no mistake! You can’t claim you did not understand. It wasnot conversation—and yet it was. Then you asked him another question, and heanswered you in exactly the same manner. As to what he meant, I am not sure Iunderstand it, because you chose not to tell me what your question was.”I repeated very carefully the questions I remembered having asked; I put them inthe order in which I had voiced them:“Am I doing the right thing? Am I on the right path? What should I do with mylife?” Don Juan said the questions I had asked were only words; it was betternot to voice the questions, but to ask them from within. He told me theprotector meant to give me a lesson; and to prove that he meant to give me alesson and not to scare me away, he showed himself as a light twice.I said I still could not understand why Mescalito terrorized me if he hadaccepted me. I reminded don Juan that, according to his statements, to beaccepted by Mescalito implied that his form was constant and did not shift frombliss to nightmare.Don Juan laughed at me again and said that if I would think about the question Ihad had in my heart when I talked to Mescalito, then I myself would understandthe lesson.To think about the question I had had in my “heart” was a difficult problem. Itold don Juan I had had many things in mind. When I asked if I was on the rightpath, I meant: Do I have one foot in each of two worlds? Which world is theright one? What course should my life take?Don Juan listened to my explanations and concluded that I did not have a clearview of the world, and that the protector had given me a beautifully clearlesson.He said, “You think there are two worlds for you—two paths.But there is only one. The protector showed you this with unbelievable clarity.The only world available to you is the world of men, and that world you cannotchoose to leave. You are a man! The protector showed you the world of happinesswhere there is no difference between things because there is no one there to askabout the difference. But that is not the world of men. The protector shook youout of it and showed you how a man thinks and fights. That is the world of man!And to be a man is to be condemned to that world. You have the vanity to believeyou live in two worlds, but that is only your vanity. There is but one singleworld for us. We are men, and must follow the world of men contentedly.“I believe that was the lesson.”9Don Juan seemed to want me to work with the devil’s weed as much as possible.This stand was incongruous with his alleged dislike of the power. He explainedhimself by saying that the time when I had to smoke again was near, and by thenI ought to have developed a better knowledge of the power of the devil’s weed.He suggested repeatedly that I should at least test the devil’s weed with onemore sorcery with the lizards. I played with the idea for a long time. DonJuan’s urgency increased dramatically until I felt obliged to heed his demand.And one day I made up my mind to divine about some stolen objects.Monday, 28 December 1964On Saturday 19 December I cut the Datura root. I waited until it was fairly darkto do my dancing around the plant. I prepared the root extract during the nightand on Sunday, about6:00 a.m . . . I went to the site of my Datura. I sat in front of the plant. Ihad taken careful notes on don Juan’s teachings about the procedure. I read mynotes again, and realized I did not have to grind the seeds there. Somehow justbeing in front of the plant gave me a rare kind of emotional stability, aclarity of thought or a power to concentrate on my actions which I ordinarilylacked.I followed all the instructions meticulously, calculating my time so that thepaste and the root were ready by late afternoon.About five o’clock I was busy trying to catch a pair of lizards.For an hour and a half I tried every method I could think of, but I failed inevery attempt.I was sitting in front of the Datura plant trying to figure out an expedient wayof accomplishing my purpose when I suddenly remembered that don Juan had saidthe lizards had to be talked to. At first I felt ludicrous talking to thelizards. It was like being embarrassed by talking in front of an audience. Thefeeling soon vanished and I went on talking. It was almost dark.I lifted a rock. A lizard was under it. It had the appearance of being numb. Ipicked it up. And then I saw that there was another stiff lizard under anotherrock. They did not even wriggle.The sewing of the mouth and eyes was the most difficult task.I noticed that don Juan had imparted a sense of irrevocability to my acts. Hisstand was that when a man begins an act there is no way to stop. If I had wantedto stop, however, there was nothing to prevent me. Perhaps I did not want tostop.I set one lizard free and it went in a northeasterly direction the omen of agood, but difficult, experience. I tied the other lizard to my shoulder andsmeared my temples as prescribed.The lizard was stiff; for a moment I thought it had died, and don Juan had nevertold me what to do if that happened. But the lizard was only numb.I drank the potion and waited awhile. I felt nothing out of the ordinary. Ibegan rubbing the paste on my temples. I applied it twenty-five times. Thenquite mechanically, as if I were absentminded, I spread it repeatedly all overmy forehead. I realized my mistake and hurriedly wiped the paste off. Myforehead was sweaty; I became feverish. Intense anxiety gripped me, for don Juanhad strongly advised me not to rub the paste on my forehead. The fear changedinto a feeling of absolute loneliness, a feeling of being doomed. I was there bymyself. If something harmful was going to happen to me, there was no one thereto help me. I wanted to run away. I had an alarming sensation of indecision, ofnot knowing what to do. A flood of thoughts rushed into my mind, flashing withextraordinary speed. I noticed that they were rather strange thoughts; that is,they were strange in the sense that they seemed to come in a different way fromordinary thoughts. I am familiar with the way I think. My thoughts have adefinite order that is my own, and any deviation is noticeable.One of the alien thoughts was about a statement made by an author. It was, Ivaguely remember, more like a voice, or something said somewhere in thebackground. It happened so fast that it startled me. I paused to consider it,but it changed into an ordinary thought. I was certain I had read the statement,but I could not think of the author’s name. I suddenly remembered that it wasAlfred Kroeber. Then another alien thought popped up and “said” that it was notKroeber, but Georg Simmel, who had made the statement. I insisted that it wasKroeber, and the next thing I knew I was in the midst of an argument withmyself. And had forgotten about my feeling of being doomed.My eyelids were heavy, as though I had taken sleeping pills.Although I had never taken any, it was the image that came to my mind. I wasfalling asleep. I wanted to go to my car and crawl in, but I couldn’t move.Then, quite suddenly, I woke up, or rather, I clearly felt that I had. My firstthought was about the time of day. I looked around. I was not in front of theDatura plant. Nonchalantly I accepted the fact that I was undergoing anotherdivinatory experience. It was 12.35 by a clock above my head. I knew it wasafternoon.I saw a young man carrying a stack of papers. I was nearly touching him. I sawthe veins of his neck pulsating and heard the fast beating of his heart. I hadbecome absorbed in what I was seeing and had not been aware, so far, of thequality of my thoughts. Then I heard a “voice” in my ear describing the scene,and I realized that the “voice” was the alien thought in my mind.I became so engrossed in listening that the scene lost its visual interest forme. I heard the voice at my right ear above my shoulder. It actually created thescene by describing it. But it obeyed my will, because I could stop it at anytime and examine the details of what it said at my leisure. I “heard-saw” theentire sequence of the young man’s actions. The voice went on explaining them inminute detail, but somehow the action was not important. The little voice wasthe extraordinary issue. Three times during the course of the experience I triedto turn around to see who was talking. I tried to turn my head all the way tothe right, or just whirl around unexpectedly to see if somebody was there.But every time I did it, my vision became blurry. I thought: “The reason Icannot turn around is because the scene is not in the realm of ordinaryreality.” And that thought was my own.From then on I concentrated my attention on the voice alone.It seemed to come from my shoulder. It was perfectly clear, although it was asmall voice. It was, however, not a child’s voice or a falsetto voice, but aminiature man’s voice. It wasn’t my voice either. I presumed it was English thatI heard. Whenever I tried deliberately to trap the voice, it subsided altogetheror became vague and the scene faded. I thought of a simile. The voice was likethe image created by dust particles in the eyelashes, or the blood vessels inthe cornea of the eye, a wormlike shape that can be seen as long as one is notlooking at it directly; but the moment one tries to look at it, it shifts out ofsight with the movement of the eyeball.I became totally disinterested in the action. As I listened the voice becamemore complex. What I thought to be a voice was more like something whisperingthoughts into my ear. But that was not accurate. Something was thinking for me.The thoughts were outside myself. I knew that was so, because I could hold myown thoughts and the thoughts of the “other” at the same time.At one point the voice created scenes acted out by the young man, which hadnothing to do with my original question about the lost objects. The young manperformed very complex acts.The action had become important again and I paid no more attention to the voice.I began to lose patience; I wanted to stop.“How can I end this?” I thought. The voice in my ear said I should go back tothe canyon. I asked how, and the voice answered that I should think of my plant.I thought of my plant. Usually I sat in front of it. I had done it so many timesthat it was quite easy for me to visualize it. I believed that seeing it, as Idid at that moment, was another hallucination, but the voice said I was “back’!I strained to listen.There was only silence. The Datura plant in front of me seemed as real aseverything else I had seen, but I could touch it, I could move around.I stood up and walked towards my ear. The effort exhausted me, and I sat downand closed my eyes. I felt dizzy and wanted so vomit. There was a buzzing in myears.Something slid on my chest. It was the lizard. I remembered don Juan’sadmonition about setting it free. I went back to the plant and untied thelizard. I did not want to see whether it was dead or alive. I broke the clay potwith the paste and kicked some dirt over it. I got into my car and fell asleep.Thursday, 24 December 1964Today I narrated the whole experience to don Juan. As usual, he listened withoutinterrupting me. At the end we had the following dialogue.“You did something very wrong.”“I know it. It was a very stupid error, an accident.”“There are no accidents when you deal with the devil’s weed. I told you shewould test you all the way. As I see it, either you are very strong or the weedreally likes you. The centre of the forehead is only for the great brujos whoknow how to handle her power.”“What usually happens when a man rubs his forehead with the paste, don Juan?”“If the man is not a great brujo he will never come back from the journey.”“Have you ever rubbed the paste on your forehead, don Juan?”“Never! My benefactor told me very few people return from such a journey. A mancould be gone for months, and would have to be tended by others. My benefactorsaid the lizards could take a man to the end of the world and show him the mostmarvellous secrets upon request.”“Do you know anybody who has ever taken that journey?”“Yes, my benefactor. But he never taught me how to return.”“Is it so very difficult to return, don Juan?”“Yes. That is why your act is truly astonishing to me. You had no steps tofollow, and we must follow certain steps, because it is in the steps where manfinds strength. Without them we are nothing.”We remained silent for hours. He seemed to be immersed in very deepdeliberation.Saturday, 26 December 1964Don Juan asked me if I had looked for the lizards. I told him I had, but that Icouldn’t find them. I asked him what would have happened if one of the lizardshad died while I was holding it. He said the death of a lizard would be anunfortunate event. If the lizard with the sewed-up mouth had died at any timethere would have been no sense in pursuing the sorcery, he said. It would alsohave meant that the lizards had withdrawn their friendship, and I would have hadto give up learning about the devil’s weed for a long time.“How long, don Juan?” I asked.“Two years or more.”“What would have happened if the other lizard had died?”“If the second lizard had died, you would have been in real danger. You wouldhave been alone, without a guide. If she died before you started the sorcery,you could have stopped it; but if you had stopped it, you would also have togive up the devil’s weed for good. If the lizard had died while she was on yourshoulder, after you had begun the sorcery, you would have had to go ahead withit, and that would truly have been madness.”“Why would it have been madness?”“Because under such conditions nothing makes sense. You are alone without aguide, seeing terrifying, nonsensical things.”“What do you mean by «nonsensical things»?”“Things we see by ourselves. Things we see when we have no direction. It meansthe devil’s weed is trying to get rid of you, finally pushing you away.”“Do you know anyone who ever experienced that?”“Yes. I did. Without the wisdom of the lizards I went mad.”“What did you see, don Juan?”“A bunch of nonsense. What else could I have seen without direction?”Monday, 28 December 1964“You told me, don Juan, that the devil’s weed tests men. What did you mean bythat?”“The devil’s weed is like a woman, and like a woman she flatters men. She setstraps for them at every turn. She did it to you when she forced you to rub thepaste on your forehead. She will try it again, and you will probably fall forit. I warn you against it. Don’t take her with passion; the devil’s weed is onlyone path to the secrets of a man of knowledge. There are other paths. But hertrap is to make you believe that hers is the only way. I say it is useless towaste your life on one path, especially if that path has no heart.”“But how do you know when a path has no heart, don Juan?”“Before you embark on it you ask the question: Does this path have a heart? Ifthe answer is no, you will know it, and then you must choose another path.”“But how will I know for sure whether a path has a heart or not?”“Anybody would know that. The trouble is nobody asks the question; and when aman finally realizes that he has taken a path without a heart, the path is readyto kill him. At that point very few men can stop to deliberate, and leave thepath.”“How should I proceed to ask the question properly, don Juan?”“Just ask it.”“I mean, is there a proper method, so I would not lie to myself and believe theanswer is yes when it really is no?”“Why would you lie?”“Perhaps because at the moment the path is pleasant and enjoyable.”“That is nonsense. A path without a heart is never enjoyable.You have to work hard even to take it. On the other hand, a path with heart iseasy; it does not make you work at liking it.”Don Juan suddenly changed the direction of the conversation and bluntlyconfronted me with the idea that I liked the devil’s weed. I had to admit that Ihad at least a preference for it. He asked me how I felt about his ally, thesmoke, and I had to tell him that just the idea of it frightened me out of mysenses.“I have told you that to choose a path you must be free from fear and ambition.But the smoke blinds you with fear, and the devil’s weed blinds you withambition.”I argued that one needs ambition even to embark on any path, and that hisstatement that one had to be free from ambition did not make sense. A person hasto have ambition in order to learn.“The desire to learn is not ambition,” he said. “It is our lot as men to want toknow, but to seek the devil’s weed is to bid for power, and that is ambition,because you are not bidding to know. Don’t let the devil’s weed blind you. Shehas hooked you already. She entices men and gives them a sense of power; shemakes them feel they can do things that no ordinary man can.But that is her trap. And, the next thing, the path without a heart will turnagainst men and destroy them. It does not take much to die, and to seek death isto seek nothing.”10In the month of December 1964 don Juan and I went to collect the differentplants needed to make the smoking mixture. It was the fourth cycle. Don Juanmerely supervised my actions. He urged me to take time, to watch, and todeliberate before I picked any of the plants. As soon as the ingredients hadbeen gathered and stored, he prompted me to meet with his ally again.Thursday, 31 December 1964“Now that you know a bit more about the devil’s weed and the smoke, you can tellmore clearly which of the two you like better,” don Juan said.“The smoke really terrifies me, don Juan. I don’t know exactly why, but I don’thave a good feeling about it.”“You like flattery, and the devil’s weed flatters you. Like a woman, she makesyou feel good. The smoke, on the other hand, is the most noble power; he has thepurest heart. He does not entice men or make them prisoners, nor does he love orhate. All he requires is strength. The devil’s weed also requires strength, butof a different kind. It is closer to being virile with women.On the other hand, the strength required by the smoke is strength of the heart.You don’t have that! But very few men have it.That is why I recommend that you learn more about the smoke.He reinforces the heart. He is not like the devil’s weed, full of passions,jealousies, and violence. The smoke is constant.You don’t have to worry about forgetting something along the line.”Wednesday, 27 January 1965On Tuesday 19 January, I smoked again the hallucinogenic mixture. I had told donJuan I felt very apprehensive about the smoke, and that it frightened me. Hesaid I had to try it again to evaluate it with justice.We walked into his room. It was almost two o’clock in the afternoon. He broughtout the pipe. I got the charcoals, then we sat facing each other. He said he wasgoing to warm up the pipe and awaken her, and if I watched carefully I would seehow she glowed. He put the pipe to his lips three or four times, and suckedthrough it. He rubbed it tenderly. Suddenly he nodded, almost imperceptibly, tosignal me to look at the pipe’s awakening. I looked, but I couldn’t see it.He handed the pipe to me. I filled the bowl with my own mixture, and then pickeda burning charcoal with a pair of tweezers I had made from a wooden clothespinand had been saving for this occasion. Don Juan looked at my tweezers and beganto laugh. I vacillated for a moment, and the charcoal stuck to the tweezers. Iwas afraid to tap them against the pipe bowl, and I had to spit on the charcoalto put it out.Don Juan turned his head away and covered his face with his arm. His body shook.For a moment I thought he was crying, but he was laughing silently.The action was interrupted for a long time; then he swiftly picked up a charcoalhimself, put it in the bowl, and ordered me to smoke. It required quite aneffort to suck through the mixture; it seemed to be very compact. After thefirst try I felt I had sucked the fine powder into my mouth. It numbed my mouthimmediately. I saw the glow in the bowl, but I never felt the smoke as the smokeof a cigarette is felt. Yet I had the sensation of inhaling something, somethingthat filled my lungs first and then pushed itself down to fill the rest of mybody.I counted twenty inhalations, and then the count did not matter any longer. Ibegan to sweat; don Juan looked at me fixedly and told me not to be afraid andto do exactly as he said.I tried to say “all right”, but instead I made a weird, howling sound. It wenton resounding after I had closed my mouth. The sound startled don Juan, who hadanother attack of laughter. I wanted to say “yes” with my head, but I couldn’tmove.Don Juan opened my hands gently and took the pipe away. He ordered me to liedown on the floor, but not to fall asleep. I wondered if he was going to help melie down but he did not. He just stared at me uninterruptedly. All of a sudden Isaw the room tumbling, and I was looking at don Juan from a position on my side.From that point on the images became strangely blurry, as in a dream. I canvaguely recall hearing don Juan talk to me a great deal during the time I wasimmobilized.I did not experience fear, or unpleasantness, during the state itself, nor was Isick upon awakening the next day. The only thing out of the ordinary was that Icould not think clearly for some time after waking up. Then gradually, in aperiod of four or five hours, I became myself again.Wednesday, 20 January 1965Don Juan did not talk about my experience, nor did he ask me to relate it tohim. His sole comment was that I had fallen asleep too soon.“The only way to stay awake is to become a bird, or a cricket, or something ofthe sort,” he said.“How do you do that, don Juan?”“That is what I am teaching you. Do you remember what I said to you yesterdaywhile you were without your body?”“I can’t recall clearly.”“I am a crow. I am teaching you how to become a crow. When you learn that, youwill stay awake, and you will move freely; otherwise you will always be glued tothe ground, wherever you fall.”Sunday, 7 February 1965My second attempt with the smoke took place about midday onSunday 31 January. I woke up the following day in the early evening. I had thesensation of possessing an unusual power to recollect whatever don Juan had saidto me during the experience. His words were imprinted on my mind. I kept onhearing them with extraordinary clarity and persistence. During this attemptanother fact became obvious to me: my entire body had become numb soon after Ibegan to swallow the fine powder, which got into my mouth every time I suckedthe pipe. Thus I not only inhaled the smoke, but also ingested the mixture.I tried to narrate my experience to don Juan; he said I had done nothingimportant. I mentioned that I could remember everything that had happened, buthe did not want to hear about it. Every memory was precise and unmistakable. Thesmoking procedure had been the same as in the previous attempt. It was almost asif the two experiences were perfectly juxtaposable, and I could start myrecollection from the time the first experience ended. I clearly remembered thatfrom the time I fell to the ground on my side I was completely devoid of feelingor thought.Yet my clarity was not impaired in any way. I remember thinking my last thoughtat about the time the room became a vertical plane: “I must have clunked my headon the floor, yet I don’t feel any pain.”From that point on I could only see and hear. I could repeat every word don Juanhad said. I followed each one of his directions. They seemed clear, logical, andeasy. He said that my body was disappearing and only my head was going toremain, and in such a condition the only way to stay awake and move around wasby becoming a crow. He commanded me to make an effort to wink, adding thatwhenever I was capable of winking I would be ready to proceed. Then he told methat my body had vanished completely and all I had was my head; he said the headnever disappears because the head is what turns into a crow.He ordered me to wink. He must have repeated this command, and all his othercommands countless times, because I could remember all of them withextraordinary clarity. I must have winked, because he said I was ready andordered me to straighten up my head and put it on my chin. He said that in thechin were the crow’s legs. He commanded me to feel the legs and observe thatthey were coming out slowly. He then said that I was not solid yet, that I hadto grow a tail, and that the tail would come out of my neck. He ordered me toextend the tail like a fan, and to feel how it swept the floor.Then he talked about the crow’s wings, and said they would come out of mycheekbones. He said it was hard and painful. He commanded me to unfold them. Hesaid they had to be extremely long, as long as I could stretch them, otherwise Iwould not be able to fly. He told me the wings were coming out and were long andbeautiful, and that I had to flap them until they were real wings.He talked about the top of my head next and said it was still very large andheavy, and its bulk would prevent my flying. He told me that the way to reduceits size was by winking; with every wink my head would become smaller. Heordered me to wink until the top weight was gone and I could jump freely.Then he told me I had reduced my head to the size of a crow, and that I had towalk around and hop until I had lost my stiffness.There was one last thing I had to change, he said, before I could fly. It wasthe most difficult change, and to accomplish it I bad to be docile and doexactly as he told me. I had to learn to see like a crow. He said that my mouthand nose were going to grow between my eyes until I had a strong beak. He saidthat crows see straight to the side, and commanded me to turn my head and lookat him with one eye. He said that if I wanted to change and look with the othereye I had to shake my beak down, and that that movement would make me lookthrough the other eye. He ordered me to shift from one eye to the other. Andthen he said I was ready to fly, and that the only way to fly was to have himtoss me into the air.I had no difficulty whatsoever eliciting the corresponding sensation to each oneof his commands. I had the perception of growing bird’s legs, which were weakand wobbly at first. I felt a tail coming out of the back of my neck and wingsout of my cheekbones. The wings were folded deeply. I felt them coming out bydegrees. The process was hard but not painful. Then I winked my head down to thesize of a crow. But the most astonishing effect was accomplished with my eyes.My bird’s sight!When don Juan directed me to grow a beak, I had an annoying sensation of lack ofair. Then something bulged out and created a block in front of me. But it wasnot until don Juan directed me to see laterally that my eyes actually werecapable of having a full view to the side. I could wink one eye at a time andshift the focusing from one eye to the other. But the sight of the room and allthe things in it was not like an ordinary sight. Yet it was impossible to tellin what way it was different. Perhaps it was lopsided, or perhaps things wereout of focus. Don Juan became very big and glowy. Something about him wascomforting and safe. Then the images blurred; they lost their outlines, andbecame sharp abstract patterns that flickered for a while.Sunday, 28 March 1965On Thursday 18 March I smoked again the hallucinogenic mixture. The initialprocedure was different in small details. I had to refill the pipe bowl once.After I had finished the first batch, don Juan directed me to clean the bowl,but he poured the mixture into the bowl himself because I lacked muscularco-ordination.It took a great deal of effort to move my arms. There was enough mixture in mybag for one refill. Don Juan looked at the bag and said this was my last attemptwith the smoke until the next year because I had used up all my provisions.He turned the little bag inside out and shook the dust into the dish that heldthe charcoals. It burned with an orange glow, as if he had placed a sheet oftransparent material over the charcoals.The sheet burst into flame, and then it cracked into an intricate pattern oflines. Something zigzagged inside the lines at high speed. Don Juan told me tolook at the movement in the lines, I saw something that looked like a smallmarble rolling back and forth in the glowing area. He leaned over, put his handinto the glow, picked out the marble, and placed it in the pipe bowl. He orderedme to take a puff. I had a clear impression that he had put the small ball intothe pipe so that I would inhale it. In a moment the room lost its horizontalposition. I felt a profound numbness, a sensation of heaviness.When I awakened, I was lying on my back at the bottom of a shallow irrigationditch, immersed in water up to my chin.Someone was holding my head up. It was don Juan. The first thought I had wasthat the water in the channel had an unusual quality; it was cold and heavy. Itslapped lightly against me, and my thoughts cleared with every movement it made.At first the water had a bright green halo, or fluorescence, which soondissolved, leaving only a stream of ordinary water.I asked don Juan about the time of day. He said it was early morning. After awhile I was completely awake, and got out of the water.“You must tell me all you saw,” don Juan said when we got to his house. He alsosaid he had been trying to “bring me back” for three days, and had had a verydifficult time doing it. I made numerous attempts to describe what I had seen,but I could not concentrate. Later on, during the early evening, I felt I wasready to talk with don Juan, and I began to tell him what I remembered from thetime I had fallen on my side, but he did not want to hear about it. He said theonly interesting part was what I saw and did after he “tossed me into the airand I flew away”.All I could remember was a series of dreamlike images or scenes. They had nosequential order. I had the impression that each one of them was like anisolated bubble, floating into focus and then moving away. They were not,however, merely scenes to look at. I was inside them. I took part in them. WhenI tried to recollect them at first, I had the sensation that they were vague,diffused flashes, but as I thought about them I realized that each one of themwas extremely clear although totally unrelated to ordinary seeing—hence, thesensation of vagueness. The images were few and simple.As soon as don Juan mentioned that he had “tossed me into the air” I had a faintrecollection of an absolutely clear scene in which I was looking straight at himfrom some distance away. I was looking at his face only. It was monumental insize. It was flat and had an intense glow. His hair was yellowish, and it moved.Each pan of his face moved by itself, projecting a sort of amber light.The next image was one in which don Juan had actually tossed me up, or hurledme, in a straight onward direction. I remember I “extended my wings and flew”. Ifelt alone, cutting through the air, painfully moving straight ahead. It wasmore like walking than like flying. It tired my body. There was no feeling offlowing free, no exuberance.Then I remembered an instant in which I was motionless, looking at a mass ofsharp, dark edges set in an area that had a dull, painful light; next I saw afield with an infinite variety of lights. The lights moved and flickered andchanged their luminosity. They were almost like colours. Their intensity dazzledme.At another moment, an object was almost against my eye. It was a thick, pointedobject; it had a definite pinkish glow. I felt a sudden tremor somewhere in mybody and saw a multitude of similar pink forms coming towards me. They all movedon me. I jumped away.The last scene I remembered was three silvery birds. They radiated a shiny,metallic light, almost like stainless steel, but intense and moving and alive. Iliked them. We flew together.Don Juan did not make any comments on my recounting.Tuesday, 23 March 1965The following conversation took place the next day, after the recounting of myexperience.Don Juan said: “It does not take much to become a crow. You did it and now youwill always be one.”“What happened after I became a crow, don Juan? Did I fly for three days?”“No, you came back at nightfall as I had told you to.”“But how did I come back?”“You were very tired and went to sleep. That is all.”“I mean did I fly back?”“I have already told you. You obeyed me and came back to the house. But don’tconcern yourself with that matter. It is of no importance.”“What is important, then?”“In your whole trip there was only one thing of great value the silvery birds!”“What was so special about them? They were just birds.”“Not just birds—they were crows.”“Were they white crows, don Juan?”“The black feathers of a crow are really silvery. The crows shine so intenselythat they are not bothered by other birds.”“Why did their feathers look silvery?”“Because you were seeing as a crow sees. A bird that looks dark to us lookswhite to a crow. The white pigeons, for instance, are pink or bluish to a crow;seagulls are yellow. Now, try to remember how you joined them.”I thought about it, but the birds were a dim, disassociated image which had nocontinuity. I told him I could remember only that I felt I had flown with them.He asked me whether I had joined them in the air or on the ground, but I couldnot possibly answer that. He became almost angry with me. He demanded that Ithink about it. He said: “All this will not mean a damn; it will be only a maddream unless you remember correctly.” I strained myself to recollect, but Icould not.Saturday, 3 April 1965Today I thought of another image in my “dream” about the silvery birds. Iremembered seeing a dark mass with myriads of pinholes. In fact, the mass was adark cluster of little holes. I don’t know why I thought it was soft. As I waslooking at it, three birds flew straight at me. One of them made a noise; thenall three of them were next to me on the ground.I described the image to don Juan. He asked me from what direction the birds hadcome. I said I couldn’t possibly determine that. He became quite impatient andaccused me of being inflexible in my thinking. He said I could very wellremember if I tried to, and that I was afraid to let myself become less rigid.He said that I was thinking in terms of men and crows, and that I was neither aman nor a crow at the time that I wanted to recollect.He asked me to remember what the crow had said to me. I tried to think about it,but my mind played on scores of other things instead. I couldn’t concentrate.Sunday, 4 April 1965I took a long hike today. It got quite dark before I reached don Juan’s house. Iwas thinking about the crows when suddenly a very strange “thought” crossed mymind. It was more like an impression or a feeling than a thought. The bird thathad made the noise said they were coming from the north and were going south,and when we met again they would be coming the same way.I told don Juan what I had thought up, or maybe remembered. He said, “Don’tthink about whether you remembered it or made it up. Such thoughts fit men only.They do not fit crows, especially those you saw, for they are the emissaries ofyour fate.You are already a crow. You will never change that. From now on the crows willtell you with their flight about every turn of your fate. In which direction didyou fly with them?”“I couldn’t know that, don Juan!”“If you think properly you will remember. Sit on the floor and tell me theposition in which you were when the birds flew to you. Close your eyes and makea line on the floor.”I followed his suggestion and determined the point.“Don’t open your eyes yet!” He proceeded, “In which direction did you all fly inrelation to that point?”I made another mark on the ground.Taking these points of orientation as a reference, don Juan interpreted thedifferent patterns of flight the crows would observe to foretell my personalfuture or fate. He set up the four points of the compass as the axis of thecrows” flight.I asked him whether the crows always followed the cardinal points to tell aman’s fate. He said that the orientation was mine alone; whatever the crows didin my first meeting with them was of crucial importance. He insisted on myrecalling every detail, for the message and the pattern of the “emissaries” werean individual, personalized matter.There was one more thing he insisted I should remember, and that was the time ofday when the emissaries left me. He asked me to think of the difference in thelight around me between the time when I “began to fly” and the time when thesilvery birds“flew with me”. When I first had the sensation of painful flight, it was dark.But when I saw the birds, everything was reddish light red, or perhaps orange.He said: “That means it was late in the day; the sun was not down yet. When itis completely dark a crow is blind with whiteness and not with darkness, the waywe are at night. This indication of the time places your last emissaries at theend of the day.They will call you, and as they fly above your head, they will become silverywhite; you will see them shining against the sky, and it will mean your time isup. It will mean you are going to die and become a crow yourself.”“What if I see them during the morning?”“You won’t see them in the morning!”“But crows fly all day.”“Not your emissaries, you fool!”“How about your emissaries, don Juan?”“Mine will come in the morning. There will also be three of them. My benefactortold me that one could shout them back to black if one does not want to die. Butnow I know it can’t be done. My benefactor was given to shouting, and to all theclatter and violence of the devil’s weed. I know the smoke is different becausehe has no passion. He is fair. When your silvery emissaries come for you, thereis no need to shout at them. Just fly with them as you have already done. Afterthey have collected you they will reverse directions, and there will be four ofthem flying away.”Saturday, 10 April 1965I had been experiencing brief flashes of disassociation, or shallow states ofnon-ordinary reality.One element from the hallucinogenic experience with the mushrooms kept recurringin my thoughts: the soft, dark mass of pinholes. I continued to visualize it asa grease or an oil bubble which began to draw me to its centre. It was almost asif the centre would open up and swallow me, and for very brief moments Iexperienced something resembling a state of nonordinary reality. As a result Isuffered moments of profound agitation, anxiety, and discomfort, and I wilfullystrove to end the experiences as soon as they began.Today I discussed this condition with don Juan. I asked for advice. He seemed tobe unconcerned and told me to disregard the experiences because they weremeaningless, or rather valueless. He said the only experiences worth my effortand concern would be those in which I saw a crow; any other kind of “vision”would be merely the product of my fears. He reminded me again that in order topartake of the smoke it was necessary to lead a strong, quiet life. Personally Iseemed to have reached a dangerous threshold. I told him I felt I could not goon; there was something truly frightening about the mushrooms.In going over the images I recalled from my hallucinogenic experience, I hadcome to the unavoidable conclusion that I had seen the world in a way that wasstructurally different from ordinary vision. In other states of non-ordinaryreality I had undergone, the forms and the patterns I had visualized were alwayswithin the confines of my visual conception of the world.But the sensation of seeing under the influence of the hallucinogenic smokemixture was not the same. Everything I saw was in front of me in a direct lineof vision; nothing was above or below that line of vision.Every image had an irritating flatness, and yet, disconcertingly, a profounddepth. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the images were aconglomerate of unbelievably sharp details set inside fields of different light;the light in the fields moved, creating an effect of rotation.After probing and exerting myself to remember, I was forced to make a series ofanalogies or similes in order to “understand” what I had “seen”. Don Juan’sface, for instance, looked as if he had been submerged in water. The waterseemed to move in a continuous flow over his face and hair. It so magnified themthat I could see every pore in his skin or every hair on his head whenever Ifocused my vision. On the other hand, I saw masses of matter that were flat andfull of edges, but did not move because there was no fluctuation in the lightthat came from them.I asked don Juan what were the things that I had seen. He said that because thiswas the first time I was seeing as a crow the images were not clear orimportant, and that later on with practice I would be able to recognizeeverything.I brought up the issue of the difference I had detected in the movement oflight. “Things that are alive”, he said, “move inside, and a crow can easily seewhen something is dead, or about to die, because the movement has stopped or isslowing down to a stop. A crow can also tell when something is moving too fast,and by the same token a crow can tell when something is moving just right.”“What does it mean when something is moving too fast, or just right?”“It means a crow can actually tell what to avoid and what to seek. Whensomething is moving too fast inside, it means it is about to explode violently,or to leap forward, and a crow will avoid it. When it moves inside just right,it is a pleasing sight and a crow will seek it.”“Do rocks move inside?”“No, not rocks or dead animals or dead trees. But they are beautiful to look at.That is why crows hang around dead bodies.They like to look at them. No light moves inside them.”“But when the flesh rots, doesn’t it change or move?”“Yes, but that is a different movement. What a crow sees then is millions ofthings moving inside the flesh with a light of their own, and that is what acrow likes to see. It is truly an unforgettable sight.”“Have you seen it yourself, don Juan?”“Anybody who learns to become a crow can see it. You will see it yourself.”At this point I asked don Juan the unavoidable question.“Did I really become a crow? I mean would anyone seeing me have thought I was anordinary crow?”“No. You can’t think that way when dealing with the power of the allies. Suchquestions make no sense, and yet to become a crow is the simplest of allmatters. It is almost like frolicking; it has little usefulness. As I havealready told you, the smoke is not for those who seek power. It is only forthose who crave to see. I learned to become a crow because these birds are themost effective of all. No other birds bother them, except perhaps larger, hungryeagles, but crows fly in groups and can defend themselves. Men don’t bothercrows either, and that is an important point. Any man can distinguish a largeeagle, especially an unusual eagle, or any other large, unusual bird, but whocares about a crow? A crow is safe. It is ideal in size and nature. It can gosafely into any place without attracting attention. On the other hand, it ispossible to become a lion or a bear, but that is rather dangerous. Such acreature is too large; it takes too much energy to become one. One can alsobecome a cricket, or a lizard, or even an ant, but that is even more dangerous,because large animals prey on small creatures.”I argued that what he was saying meant that one really changed into a crow, or acricket, or anything else. But he insisted I was misunderstanding.“It takes a very long time to learn to be a proper crow,” he said.“But you did not change, nor did you stop being a man. There is something else.”“Can you tell me what the something else is, don Juan?”“Perhaps by now you know it yourself. Maybe if you were not so afraid ofbecoming mad, or of losing your body, you would understand this marvelloussecret. But perhaps you must wait until you lose your fear to understand what Imean.”11The last event I recorded in my field notes took place in September 1965. It wasthe last of don Juan’s teachings. I called it “a special state of non-ordinaryreality” because it was not the product of any of the plants I had used before.It seemed that don Juan elicited it by means of a careful manipulation of cuesabout himself; that is to say, he behaved in front of me in so skilful a mannerthat he created the clear and sustained impression that he was not reallyhimself, hut someone impersonating him.As a result I experienced a profound sense of conflict; I wanted to believe itwas don Juan, and yet I could not be sure of it. The concomitant of the conflictwas a conscious terror, so acute that it impaired my health for several weeks.Afterwards I thought it would have been wise to end my apprenticeship then. Ihave never been a participant since that time, yet don Juan has not ceased toconsider me an apprentice. He has regarded my withdrawal only as a necessaryperiod of recapitulation, another step of learning, which may last indefinitely.Since that time, however, he has never expounded on his knowledge.I wrote the detailed account of my last experience almost a month after ithappened, although I had already written copious notes on its salient points onthe following day during the hours of great emotional agitation which precededthe highest point of my terror.Friday, 29 October 1965On Thursday 30 September 1965, I went to see don Juan. The brief, shallow statesof non-ordinary reality had been persisting in spite of my deliberate attemptsto end them, or slough them off as don Juan had suggested. I felt that mycondition was getting worse, for the duration of such states was increasing. Ibecame sharply aware of the noise of airplanes. The sound of their motors goingoverhead would unavoidably catch my attention and fix it, to the point where Ifelt I was following the plane as if I were inside it, or .flying with it. Thissensation was very annoying. My inability to shake it off produced a deepanxiety in me.Don Juan, after listening attentively to all the details, concluded that I wassuffering from a loss of soul. I told him I had been having these hallucinationsever since the time I had smoked the mushrooms, but he insisted that they were anew development. He said that earlier I had been afraid, and had just“dreamed nonsensical things”, but that now I was truly bewitched. The proof wasthat the noise of the flying airplanes could carry me away. Ordinarily, he said,the noise of a brook or a river can trap a bewitched man who has lost his souland carry him away to his death. He then asked me to describe all my activitiesduring the time prior to experiencing the hallucinations. I listed all theactivities I could remember. And from my account he deduced the place where Ihad lost my soul.Don Juan seemed to be overly preoccupied, a state that was quite unusual forhim. This naturally increased my apprehension. He said he had no definite ideaas to who had trapped my soul, but whoever it was intended without doubt to killme or make me very ill. Then he gave me precise instructions about a “fightingform”, a specific bodily position to be maintained while I remained on mybeneficial spot. I had to maintain this posture he called a form [una forma parapelear].I asked him what all that was for, and whom I was going to fight. He repliedthat he was going away to see who had taken my soul, and to find out if it waspossible to get it back. In the meantime, I was supposed to stay on my spotuntil his return.The fighting form was actually a precaution, he said, in case something happenedduring his absence, and it had to be used if I was attacked. It consisted ofclapping the calf and thigh of my right leg and stomping my left foot in a kindof dance I had to do while facing the attacker.He warned me that the form had to be adopted only in moments of extreme crisis,but so long as there was no danger in sight I should simply sit cross-legged onmy spot. Under circumstances of extreme danger, however, he said I could resortto one last means of defence—hurling an object at the enemy. He told me thatordinarily one hurls a power object, but since I did not possess any I wasforced to use any small rock that would fit into the palm of my right hand, arock I could hold by pressing it against my palm with my thumb. He said thatsuch a technique should be used only if one was indisputably in danger of losingone’s life. The hurling of the object had to be accompanied by a war cry, a yellthat had the property of directing the object to its mark. He emphaticallyrecommended that I be careful and deliberate about the outcry and not use it atrandom, but only under “severe conditions of seriousness”.I asked what he meant by “severe conditions of seriousness”.He said that the outcry or war cry was something that remained with a man forthe duration of his life; thus it had to be good from the very beginning. Andthe only way to start it correctly was by holding back one’s natural fear andhaste until one was absolutely filled with power, and then the yell would burstout with direction and power. He said these were the conditions of seriousnessneeded to launch the yell.I asked him to explain about the power that was supposed to fill one before theoutcry. He said that was something that ran through the body coming from theground where one stood; it was a kind of power that emanated from the beneficialspot, to be exact. It was a force that pushed the yell out. If such a force wasproperly managed, the battle cry would be perfect.I asked him again if he thought something was going to happen to me. He said heknew nothing about it and admonished me dramatically to stay glued to my spotfor as long as it was necessary, because that was the only protection I hadagainst anything that might happen.I began to feel frightened; I begged him to be more specific.He said all he knew was that I should not move under any circumstances; I wasnot to go into the house or into the bush.Above all, he said, I should not utter a single word, not even to him. He said Icould sing my Mescalito songs if I became too frightened, and then he added thatI knew already too much about these matters to have to be warned like a childabout the importance of doing everything correctly.His admonitions produced a state of profound anguish in me.I was sure he was expecting something to happen. I asked him why he recommendedthat I sing the Mescalito songs, and what he believed was going to frighten me.He laughed and said I might become afraid of being alone. He walked into thehouse and closed the door behind him. I looked at my watch. It was7:00 p.m. I sat quietly for a long time. There were no sounds coming from donJuan’s room. Everything was quiet. It was windy. I thought of making a dash formy car to get my windbreaker, but I did not dare to go against don Juan’sadvice. I was not sleepy, but tired; the cold wind made it impossible for me torest.Four hours later I heard don Juan walking around the house.I thought he might have left through the back to urinate in the bushes. Then hecalled me loudly.“Hey boy! Hey boy! I need you here,” he said.I nearly got up to go to him. It was his voice, but not his tone, or his usualwords. Don Juan had never called me “Hey boy!”So I stayed where I was. A chill went up my back. He began to yell again usingthe same, or a similar, phrase.I heard him walking around the back of his house. He stumbled on a woodpile asif he did not know it was there. Then he came to the porch and sat next to thedoor with his back against the wall. He seemed heavier than usual. His movementswere not slow or clumsy, just heavier. He plunked down on the floor, instead ofsliding nimbly as he usually did. Besides, that was not his spot, and don Juanwould never under any circumstances sit anywhere else.Then he talked to me again. He asked me why I refused to come when he needed me.He talked loudly. I did not want to look at him, and yet I had a compulsive urgeto watch him. He began to swing slightly from side to side. I changed myposition, adopted the fighting form he had taught me, and turned to face him. Mymuscles were stiff and strangely tense. I do not know what prompted me to adoptthe fighting form, but perhaps it was because I believed don Juan wasdeliberately trying to scare me by creating the impression that the person I sawwas not really himself. I felt he was very careful about doing the unaccustomedin order to establish doubt in my mind. I was afraid, but still I felt I wasabove it all, because I was actually taking stock of and analysing the entiresequence.At that point don Juan got up. His motions were utterly unfamiliar. He broughthis arms in front of his body, and pushed himself up, lifting his backsidefirst; then he grabbed the door and straightened out the top part of his body. Iwas amazed about how deeply familiar I was with his movements, and what anawesome feeling he had created by letting me see a don Juan who did not movelike don Juan.He took a couple of steps towards me. He held the lower part of his back withboth hands as if he were trying to straighten up, or as if he were in pain. Hewhined and puffed. His nose seemed to be stuffed up. He said he was going totake me with him, and ordered me to get up and follow him. He walked towards thewest side of the house. I shifted my position to face him. He turned to me. Idid not move from my spot; I was glued to it.He bellowed, “Hey boy! I told you to come with me. If you don’t come I’ll dragyou!”He walked towards me. I began beating my calf and thigh, and dancing fast. Hegot to the edge of the porch in front of me and nearly touched me. Frantically Iprepared my body to adopt the hurling position, but he changed directions andmoved away from me, towards the bushes to my left. At one moment, as he waswalking away, he turned suddenly, but I was facing him.He went out of sight. I retained the fighting posture for a while longer, but asI did not see him any more I sat cross-legged again with my back to the rock. Bythen I was really frightened.I wanted to run away, yet that thought terrified me even more. I felt I wouldhave been completely at his mercy if he had caught me on the way to my car. Ibegan to sing the peyote songs I knew. But somehow I felt they were impotentthere. They served only as a pacifier, yet they soothed me. I sang them over andover.About 2:45 a.m. I heard a noise inside the house. I immediately changed myposition. The door was flung open and don Juan stumbled out. He was gasping andholding his throat. He knelt in front of me and moaned. He asked me in a high,whining voice to come and help him. Then he bellowed again and ordered me tocome. He made gargling sounds. He pleaded with me to come and help him becausesomething was choking him.He crawled on his hands and knees until he was perhaps four feet away. Heextended his hands to me. He said, “Come here!”Then he got up. His arms were extended towards me. He seemed ready to grab me. Istomped my foot on the ground and clapped my calf and thigh. I was beside myselfwith fear.He stopped and walked to the side of the house and into the bushes. I shifted myposition to face him. Then I sat down again. I did not want to sing any more. Myenergy seemed to be waning. My entire body ached; all my muscles were stiff andpainfully contracted. I did not know what to think. I could not make up my mindwhether to be angry at don Juan or not. I thought of jumping him, but somehow Iknew he would have cut me down, like a bug. I really wanted to cry. Iexperienced a profound despair; the thought that don Juan was going all the wayout to frighten me made me feel like weeping. I was incapable of finding areason for his tremendous display of histrionics; his movements were so artfulthat I became confused.It was not as if he was trying to move like a woman; it was as if a woman wastrying to move like don Juan. I had the impression that she was really trying towalk and move with don Juan’s deliberation, but was too heavy and did not havethe nimbleness of don Juan. Whoever it was in front of me created the impressionof being a younger, heavy woman trying to imitate the slow movements of an agileold man.“These thoughts threw me into a state of panic. A cricket began to call loudly,very close to me. I noticed the richness of its tone; I fancied it to have abaritone voice. The call started to fade away. Suddenly my whole body jerked. Iassumed the fighting position again and faced the direction from which thecricket’s call had come. The sound was taking me away; it had begun to trap mebefore I realized it was only cricket-like. The sound got closer again. Itbecame terribly loud. I started to sing my peyote songs louder and louder.Suddenly the cricket stopped. I immediately sat down, but kept on singing. Amoment later I saw the shape of a man running towards me from the directionopposite to that of the cricket’s call. I clapped my hands on my thigh and calfand stomped vigorously, frantically. The shape went by very fast, almosttouching me. It looked like a dog.I experienced so dreadful a fear that I was numb. I cannot recollect anythingelse I felt or thought.The morning dew was refreshing. I felt better. Whatever the phenomenon was, itseemed to have withdrawn. It was 5:48 a.m. when don Juan opened the door quietlyand came out. He stretched his arms, yawning, and glanced at me. He took twosteps towards me, prolonging his yawning. I saw his eyes looking throughhalf-closed eyelids. I jumped up; I knew then that whoever, or whatever, was infront of me was not don Juan.I took a small, sharp-edged rock from the ground. It was next to my right hand.I did not look at it; I just held it by pressing it with my thumb against myextended fingers. I adopted the form don Juan had taught me. I felt a strangevigour filling me, in a matter of seconds. Then I yelled and hurled the rock athim. I thought it was a magnificent outcry. At that moment I did not carewhether I lived or died. I felt the cry was awesome in its potency. It waspiercing and prolonged, and it actually directed my aim. The figure in frontwobbled and shrieked and staggered to the side of the house and into the bushesagain.It took me hours to calm down. I could not sit any more; I kept on trotting onthe same place. I had to breathe through my mouth to take in enough air.At 11:00 a.m. don Juan came out again. I was going to jump up, but the movementswere his. He went directly to his spot and sat down in his usual familiar way.He looked at me and smiled.He was don Juan! I went to him, and instead of being angry, I kissed his hand. Ireally believed then that he had not acted to create a dramatic effect, but thatsomeone had impersonated him to cause me harm or to kill me.The conversation began with speculations about the identity of a female personwho had allegedly taken my soul. Then don Juan asked me to tell him about everydetail of my experience.I narrated the whole sequence of events in a very deliberate manner. He laughedall the way, as if it were a joke. When I had finished he said, “You did fine.You won the battle for your soul.But this matter is more serious than I thought. Your life wasn’t worth two hootslast night. It is fortunate you learned something in the past. Had you not had alittle training you would be dead by now, because whoever you saw last nightmeant to finish you off.”“How is it possible, don Juan, that she could take your form?”“Very simple. She is a diablera and has a good helper on the other side. But shewas not too good in assuming my likeness, and you caught on to her trick.”“Is a helper on the other side the same as an ally?”“No, a helper is the aid of a diablero. A helper is a spirit that lives on theother side of the world and helps a diablero to cause sickness and pain. Ithelps him to kill.”“Can a diablero also have an ally, don Juan?”“It is the diableros who have the allies, but before a diablero can tame anally, he usually has a helper to aid him in his tasks.”“How about the woman who took your form, don Juan? Does she have only a helperand not an ally?”“I don’t know whether she has an ally or not. Some people do not like the powerof an ally and prefer a helper. To tame an ally is hard work. It is easier toget a helper on the other side.”“Do you think I could get a helper?”“To know that, you have to learn much more. We are again at the beginning,almost as on the first day you came over and asked me to tell you aboutMescalito, and I could not because you would not have understood. That otherside is the world ofdiableros. I think it would be best to tell you my ownfeelings in the same way my benefactor told me his. He was a diablero and awarrior; his life was inclined towards the force and the violence of the world.But I am neither of them. That is my nature. You have seen my world from thestart. As to showing you the world of my benefactor, I can only put you at thedoor, and you will have to decide for yourself; you will have to learn about itby your effort alone. I must admit now that I made a mistake. It is much better,I see now, to start the way I did, myself. Then it is easier to realize howsimple and yet how profound the difference is. A diablero is a diablero, and awarrior is a warrior. Or a man can be both. There are enough people who areboth. But a man who only traverses the paths of life is everything. Today I amneither a warrior nor a diablero. For me there is only the travelling on thepaths that have a heart, on any path that may have a heart. There I travel, andthe only worthwhile challenge for me is to traverse its full length. And there Itravel—looking, looking, breathlessly.”He paused. His face revealed a peculiar mood; he seemed to be unusually serious.I did not know what to ask or to say. He proceeded:“The particular thing to learn is how to get to the crack between the worlds andhow to enter the other world. There is a crack between the two worlds, the worldof the diableros and the world of living men. There is a place where the twoworlds overlap. The crack is there. It opens and closes like a door in the wind.To get there a man must exercise his will. He must, I should say, develop anindomitable desire for it, a single-minded dedication. But he must do it withoutthe help of any power or any man. The man by himself must ponder and wish up toa moment in which his body is ready to undergo the journey. That moment isannounced by prolonged shaking of the limbs and violent vomiting. The manusually cannot sleep or eat, and wanes away. When the convulsions do not stopthe man is ready to go, and the crack between the worlds appears right in frontof his eyes, like a monumental door, a crack that goes up and down.When the crack opens the man has to slide through it. It is hard to see on theother side of the boundary. It is windy, like a sandstorm. The wind whirlsaround. The man then must walk in any direction. It will be a short or a longjourney, depending on his willpower. A strong-willed man journeys shortly. Anundecided, weak man journeys long and precariously. After this journey the manarrives at a sort of plateau. It is possible to distinguish some of its featuresclearly. It is a plane above the ground. It is possible to recognize it by thewind, which there becomes even more violent, whipping, roaring a11 around. Ontop of that plateau is the entrance to that other world. And there stands a skinthat separates the two worlds; dead men go through it without a noise, but wehave to break it with an outcry. The wind gathers strength, the same unruly windthat blows on the plateau. When the wind has gathered enough force, the man hasto yell and the wind will push him through. Here his will has to be inflexible,too, so that he can fight the wind. All he needs is a gentle shove; he does notneed to be blown to the ends of the other world.Once on the other side, the man will have to wander around. His good fortunewould be to find a helper nearby—not too far from the entrance. The man has toask him for help. In his own words he has to ask the helper to teach him andmake him a diablero.When the helper agrees, he kills the man on the spot, and while he is dead heteaches him. When you make the trip yourself, depending on your luck, you mayfind a great diablero in the helper who will kill you and teach you. Most of thetime, though, one encounters lesser brujos who have very little to teach. Butneither you nor they have the power to refuse. The best instance is to find amale helper lest one become the prey of a diablera, who will make one suffer inan unbelievable manner. Women are always like that. But that depends on luckalone, unless one’s benefactor is a great diablero himself, in which event hewill have many helpers in the other world, and can direct one to see aparticular helper. My benefactor was such a man. He directed me to encounter hisspirit helper. After your return, you will not be the same man. You arecommitted to come back to see your helper often. And you are committed to wanderfarther and farther from the entrance, until finally one day you will go too farand will not be able to return. Sometimes a diablero may catch a soul and pushit through the entrance and leave it in the custody of his helper until he robsthe person of all his willpower. In other cases, like yours for instance, thesoul belongs to a strong-willed person, and the diablero may keep it inside hispouch, because it is too hard to carry otherwise. In such instances, as inyours, a fight may resolve the problem—a fight in which the diablero either winsall, or loses all. This time she lost the combat and had to release your soul.Had she won she would have taken it to her helper, for keeps.”“But how did I win?”“You did not move from your spot. Had you moved one inch away you would havebeen demolished. She chose the moment I was away as the best time to strike, andshe did it well. She failed because she did not count on your own nature, whichis violent, and also because you did not budge from the spot on which you areinvincible.”“How would she have killed me if I had moved?”“She would have hit you like a thunderbolt. But above all she would have keptyour soul and you would have wasted away.”“What is going to happen now, don Juan?”“Nothing. You won your soul back. It was a good battle. You learned many thingslast night.”Afterwards we began to look for the stone I had hurled. He said if we could findit we could be absolutely sure the affair had ended. We looked for nearly threehours. I had the feeling I would recognize it. But I could not.That same day in the early evening don Juan took me into the hills around hishouse. There he gave me long and detailed instructions on specific fightingprocedures. At one moment in the course of repeating certain prescribed steps Ifound myself alone. I had run up a slope and was out of breath. I was perspiringfreely, and yet I was cold. I called don Juan several times, but he did notanswer, and I began to experience a strange apprehension. I heard a rustling inthe underbrush as if someone was coming towards me. I listened attentively, butthe noise stopped. Then it came again, louder and closer. At that moment itoccurred to me that the events of the preceding night were going to be repeated.In a matter of a few seconds my fear grew out of all proportion. The rustle inthe underbrush got closer, and my strength waned. I wanted to scream or weep,run away or faint. My knees sagged; I fell to the ground, whining. I could noteven close my eyes. After that, I remember only that don Juan made a fire andrubbed the contracted muscles of my arms and legs.I remained in a state of profound distress for several hours.Afterwards don Juan explained my disproportionate reaction as a commonoccurrence. I said I could not figure out logically what had caused my panic,and he replied that it was not the fear of dying, but rather the fear of losingmy soul, a fear common among men who do not have unbending intent.That experience was the last of don Juan’s teachings. Ever since that time Ihave refrained from seeking his lessons. And, although don Juan has not changedhis benefactor’s attitude towards me, I do believe that I have succumbed to thefirst enemy of a man of knowledge."},{"pageContent":"Part TwoA Structural AnalysisThe following structural scheme, abstracted from the data on the states ofnon-ordinary reality presented in the foregoing part of this work, is conceivedas an attempt to disclose the internal cohesion and the cogency of don Juan’steachings. The structure, as I assess it, is composed of four concepts which arethe main units: (1) man of knowledge; (2) a man of knowledge had an ally; (3) anally had a rule; and (4) the rule was corroborated by special consensus. Thesefour units are in turn composed of a number of subsidiary ideas; thus the totalstructure comprises all the meaningful concepts that were presented until thetime I discontinued the apprenticeship. In a sense, these units representsuccessive levels of analysis, each level modifying the preceding one.Because this conceptual structure is completely dependent on the meaning of allits units, the following clarification seems to be pertinent at this point:Throughout this entire work, meaning has been rendered as I understood it. Thecomponent concepts of don Juan’s knowledge as I have presented them here couldnot be the exact duplicate of what he said himself. In spite of all the effort Ihave put forth to render these concepts as faithfully as possible, their meaninghas been deflected by my own attempts to classify them. The arrangement of thefour main units of this structural scheme is, however, a logical sequence whichappears to be free from the influence of extraneous classificatory devices of myown. But, insofar as the component ideas of each main unit are concerned, it hasbeen impossible to discard my personal influence. At certain points extraneousclassificatory items are necessary in order to render the phenomenaunderstandable. And, if such a task was to be accomplished here, it had to bedone by zigzagging back and forth from the alleged meanings and classificatoryscheme of the teacher to the meanings and classificatory devices of theapprentice.THE OPERATIVE ORDERThe First UnitMAN OF KNOWLEDGEAt a very early stage of my apprenticeship, don Juan made the statement that thegoal of his teachings was “to show how to become a man of knowledge”. I use thatstatement as a point of departure. It is obvious that to become a man ofknowledge was an operational goal. And it is also obvious that every part of donJuan’s orderly teachings was geared to fulfill that goal in one way or another.My line of reasoning here is that under the circumstances “man of knowledge”,being an operational goal, must have bean indispensable to explaining some“operative order”.Then, it is justifiable to conclude that, in order to understand that operativeorder, one has to understand its objective: man of knowledge.After having established “man of knowledge” as the first structural unit, it waspossible for me to arrange with assurance the following seven concepts as itsproper components: (1) to become a man of knowledge was a matter of learning;(2) a man of knowledge had unbending intent; (3) a man of knowledge had clarityof mind; (4) to become a man of knowledge was a matter of strenuous labour; (5)a man of knowledge was a warrior; (6) to become a man of knowledge was anunceasing process; and (7) a man of knowledge had an ally.These seven concepts were themes. They ran through the teachings, determiningthe character of don Juan’s entire knowledge. Inasmuch as the operational goalof his teachings was to produce a man of knowledge, everything he taught wasimbued with the specific characteristics of each of the seven themes. Togetherthey construed the concept “man of knowledge” as a way of conducting oneself, away of behaving that was the end result of a long and hazardous training. “Manof knowledge”, however, was not a guide to behaviour, but a set of principlesencompassing all the un-ordinary circumstances pertinent to the knowledge beingtaught.Each one of the seven themes was composed, in turn, of various other concepts,which covered their different facets.From don Juan’s statements it was possible to assume that a man of knowledgecould be a diablero, that is, a black sorcerer.He stated that his teacher was a diablero and so was he in the past, although hehad ceased to be concerned with certain aspects of the practice of sorcery.Since the goal of his teaching was to show how to become a man of knowledge, andsince his knowledge consisted of being a diablero, there may have been aninherent connexion between man of knowledge and diablero.Although don Juan never used the two terms interchangeably, the likelihood thatthey were connected raised the possibility that “man of knowledge” with itsseven themes and their component concepts covered, theoretically, all thecircumstances that might have arisen in the course of becoming a diablero.To become a man of knowledge was a matter of learningThe first theme made it implicit that learning was the only possible way ofbecoming a man of knowledge, and that in turn implied the act of making aresolute effort to achieve an end. To become a man of knowledge was the endresult of a process, as opposed to an immediate acquisition through an act ofgrace or through bestowal by supernatural powers. The plausibility of learninghow to become a man of knowledge warranted the existence of a system forteaching one how to accomplish it.The first theme had three components: (1) there were no overt requirements forbecoming a man of knowledge; (2) there were some covert requirements; (3) thedecision as to who could learn to become a man of knowledge was made by animpersonal power.Apparently there were no overt prerequisites that would have determined who was,or who was not, qualified to learn how to become a man of knowledge. Ideally,the task was open to anybody who wished to pursue it. Yet, in practice, such astand was inconsistent with the fact that don Juan as a teacher selected hisapprentices.In fact, any teacher under the circumstances would have selected his apprenticesby means of matching them against some covert prerequisites. The specific natureof these prerequisites was never formalized; don Juan only insinuated that therewere certain clues one had to bear in mind when viewing a prospectiveapprentice. The clues he alluded to were supposed to reveal whether or not thecandidate had a certain disposition of character, which don Juan called“unbending intent”.Nevertheless, the final decision in matters of who could learn to become a manof knowledge was left to an impersonal power that was known to don Juan, but wasoutside his sphere of volition. The impersonal power was credited with pointingout the right person by allowing him to perform a deed of extraordinary nature,or by creating a set of peculiar circumstances around that person. Hence, therewas never a conflict between the absence of overt prerequisites and theexistence of undisclosed, covert prerequisites.The man who was singled out in that manner became the apprentice. Don Juancalled him the escogido, the “one who was chosen”. But to be an escogido meantmore than to be a mere apprentice. An escogido, by the sheer act of beingselected by a power, was considered already to be different from ordinary men.He was considered already to be the recipient of a minimum amount of power whichwas supposed to be augmented by learning.But learning was a process of unending quest, and the power that made theoriginal decision, or a similar power, was expected to make similar decisions onthe issue of whether an escogido could continue learning or whether he had beendefeated. Those decisions were manifested through omens that occurred at anypoint of the teachings. In that respect, any peculiar circumstances surroundingan apprentice were considered to be such omens.A man of knowledge had unbending intentThe idea that a man of knowledge needed unbending intent referred to theexercise of volition. Having unbending intent meant having the will to execute anecessary procedure by maintaining oneself at all times rigidly within theboundaries of the knowledge being taught. A man of knowledge needed a rigid willin order to endure the obligatory quality that every act possessed when it wasperformed in the context of his knowledge.The obligatory quality of all the acts performed in such a context, and theirbeing inflexible and predetermined, were no doubt unpleasant to any man, forwhich reason a modicum of unbending intent was sought as the only covertrequirement needed by a prospective apprentice.Unbending intent was composed of (1) frugality, (2) soundness of judgement, and(3) lack of freedom to innovate.A man of knowledge needed frugality because the majority of the obligatory actsdealt with instances or with elements that were either outside the boundaries ofordinary everyday life, or were not customary in ordinary activity, and the manwho had to act in accordance with them needed an extraordinary effort every timehe took action. It was implicit that one could have been capable of such anextraordinary effort only by being frugal with any other activity that did notdeal directly with such predetermined actions.Since all acts were predetermined and obligatory, a man of knowledge neededsoundness of judgement. This concept did not imply common sense, but did implythe capacity to assess the circumstances surrounding any need to act. A guidefor such an assessment was provided by bringing together, as rationales, all theparts of the teachings which were at one’s command at the given moment in whichany action had to be carried out.Thus, the guide was always changing as more parts were learned; yet it alwaysimplied the conviction that any obligatory act one may have had to perform was,in fact, the most appropriate under the circumstances.Because all acts were pre-established and compulsory, having to carry them outmeant lack of freedom to innovate. Don Juan’s system of imparting knowledge wasso well established that there was no possibility of altering it in any way.A man of knowledge had clarity of mindClarity of mind was the theme that provided a sense of direction. The fact thatall acts were predetermined meant that one’s orientation within the knowledgebeing taught was equally predetermined; as a consequence, clarity of mindsupplied only a sense of direction. It reaffirmed continuously the validity ofthe course being taken through the component ideas of (1) freedom to seek apath, (2) knowledge of the specific purpose, and (3) being fluid.It was believed that one had freedom to seek a path. Having the freedom tochoose was not incongruous with the lack of freedom to innovate; these two ideaswere not in opposition nor did they interfere with each other. Freedom to seek apath referred to the liberty to choose among different possibilities of actionwhich were equally effective and usable. The criterion for choosing was theadvantage of one possibility over others, based on one’s preference. As a matterof fact, the freedom to choose a path imparted a sense of direction through theexpression of personal inclinations.Another way to create a sense of direction was through the idea that there was aspecific purpose for every action performed in the context of the knowledgebeing taught. Therefore, a man of knowledge needed clarity of mind in order tomatch his own specific reasons for acting with the specific purpose of everyaction. The knowledge of the specific purpose of every action was the guide heused to judge the circumstances surrounding any need to act.Another facet of clarity of mind was the idea that a man of knowledge, in orderto reinforce the performance of his obligatory actions, needed to assemble allthe resources that the teachings had placed at his command. This was the idea ofbeing fluid. It created a sense of direction by giving one the feeling of beingmalleable and resourceful. The compulsory quality of all acts would have imbuedone with a sense of stiffness or sterility had it not been for the idea that aman of knowledge needed to be fluid.To become a man of knowledge was a matter of strenuous labourA man of knowledge had to possess or had to develop in the course of histraining an all-around capacity for exertion. Don Juan stated that to become aman of knowledge was a matter of strenuous labour. Strenuous labour denoted acapacity (1) to put forth dramatic exertion; (2) to achieve efficacy; and (3) tomeet challenge.In the path of a man of knowledge drama was undoubtedly the outstanding singleissue, and a special type of exertion was needed for responding to circumstancesthat required dramatic exploitation; that is to say, a man of knowledge neededdramatic exertion. Taking don Juan’s behaviour as an example, at first glance itmay have seemed that his dramatic exertion was only his own idiosyncraticpreference for histrionics. Yet his dramatic exertion was always much more thanacting; it was rather a profound state of belief. He imparted through dramaticexertion the peculiar quality of finality to all the acts he performed.As a consequence, then, his acts were set on a stage in which death was one ofthe main protagonists. It was implicit that death was a real possibility in thecourse of learning because of the inherently dangerous nature of the items withwhich a man of knowledge dealt; then, it was logical that the dramatic exertioncreated by the conviction that death was a ubiquitous player was more thanhistrionics.Exertion entailed not only drama, but also the need of efficacy.Exertion had to be effective; it had to possess the quality of being properlychannelled, of being suitable. The idea of impending death created not only thedrama needed for overall emphasis, but also the conviction that every actioninvolved a struggle for survival, the conviction that annihilation would resultif one’s exertion did not meet the requirement of being efficacious.Exertion also entailed the idea of challenge, that is, the act of testingwhether, and proving that, one was capable of performing a proper act within therigorous boundaries of the knowledge being taught.A man of knowledge was a warriorThe existence of a man of knowledge was an unceasing struggle, and the idea thathe was a warrior, leading a warrior’s life, provided one with the means forachieving emotional stability. The idea of a man at war encompassed fourconcepts: (1) a man of knowledge had to have respect; (2) he had to have fear;(3) he had to be wide-awake; (4) he had to be self-confident. Hence, to be awarrior was a form of self-discipline which emphasized individualaccomplishment; yet it was a stand in which personal interests were reduced to aminimum, as in most instances personal interest was incompatible with the rigourneeded to perform any predetermined, obligatory act.A man of knowledge in his role of warrior was obligated to have an attitude ofdeferential regard for the items with which he dealt; he had to imbue everythingrelated to his knowledge with profound respect in order to place everything in ameaningful perspective. Having respect was equivalent to having assessed one’sinsignificant resources when facing the Unknown.If one remained in that frame of thought, the idea of respect was logicallyextended to include oneself, for one was as unknown as the Unknown itself. Theexercise of so sobering a feeling of respect transformed the apprenticeship ofthis specific knowledge, which may otherwise have appeared to be absurd, into avery rational alternative.Another necessity of a warrior’s life was the need to experience and carefullyto evaluate the sensation of fear. The ideal was that, in spite of fear, one hadto proceed with the course of one’s acts. Fear was supposed to be conquered andthere was an alleged time in the life of a man of knowledge when it wasvanquished, but first one had to be conscious of being afraid and duly toevaluate that sensation. Don Juan asserted that one was capable of conqueringfear only by facing it.As a warrior, a man of knowledge also needed to be wideawake. A man at war hadto be on the alert in order to be cognizant of most of the factors pertinent tothe two mandatory aspects of awareness: (1) awareness of intent and (2)awareness of the expected flux.Awareness of intent was the act of being cognizant of the factors involved inthe relationship between the specific purpose of any obligatory act and one’sown specific purpose for acting.Since all the obligatory acts had a definite purpose, a man of knowledge had tobe wide-awake; that is, he needed to be capable at all times of matching thedefinite purpose of every obligatory act with the definite reason that he had inmind for desiring to act.A man of knowledge, by being aware of that relationship, was also capable ofbeing cognizant of what was believed to be the expected flux. What I have calledhere the “awareness of the expected flux” referred to the certainty that one wascapable of detecting at all times the important variables involved in therelationship between the specific purpose of every act and one’s specific reasonfor acting. By being aware of the expected flux one was supposed to detect themost subtle changes. That deliberate awareness of changes accounted for therecognition and interpretation of omens and of other un-ordinary events.The last aspect of the idea of a warrior’s behaviour was the need forself-confidence, that is, the assurance that the specific purpose of an act onemay have chosen to perform was the only plausible alternative for one’s ownspecific reasons for acting.Without self-confidence, one would have been incapable of fulfilling one of themost important aspects of the teachings: the capacity to claim knowledge aspower.To become a man of knowledge was an unceasing processBeing a man of knowledge was not a condition entailing permanency. There wasnever the certainty that, by carrying out the predetermined steps of theknowledge being taught, one would become a man of knowledge. It was implicitthat the function of the steps was only to show how to become a man ofknowledge.Thus, becoming a man of knowledge was a task that could not be fully achieved;rather, it was an unceasing process comprising (1) the idea that one had torenew the quest of becoming a man of knowledge; (2) the idea of one’simpermanency; and (3) the idea that one had to follow the path with heart.The constant renewal of the quest of becoming a man of knowledge was expressedin the theme of the four symbolic enemies encountered on the path of learning:fear, clarity, power, and old age. Renewing the quest implied the gaining andthe maintenance of control over oneself. A true man of knowledge was expected tobattle each of the four enemies, in succession, until the last moment of hislife, in order to keep himself actively engaged in becoming a man of knowledge.Yet, despite the truthful renewal of the quest, the odds were inevitably againstman; he would succumb to his last symbolic enemy. This was the idea ofimpermanency.Off-setting the negative value of one’s impermanency was the notion that one hadto follow the “path with heart”. The path with heart was a metaphorical way ofasserting that in spite of being impermanent one still had to proceed and had tobe capable of finding satisfaction and personal fulfillment in the act ofchoosing the most amenable alternative and identifying oneself completely withit.Don Juan synthesized the rationale of his whole knowledge in the metaphor thatthe important thing for him was to find a path with heart and then travel itslength, meaning that the identification with the amenable alternative was enoughfor him. The journey by itself was sufficient; any hope of arriving at apermanent position was outside the boundaries of his knowledge.The Second UnitA MAN OF KNOWLEDGE HAD AN ALLYThe idea that a man of knowledge had an ally was the most important of the sevencomponent themes, for it was the only one that was indispensable to explainingwhat a man of knowledge was. In don Juan’s classificatory scheme a man ofknowledge had an ally, whereas the average man did not, and having an ally waswhat made him different from ordinary men.Don Juan described an ally as being “a power capable of transporting a manbeyond the boundaries of himself”; that is, an ally was a power that allowed oneto transcend the realm of ordinary reality. Consequently, to have an allyimplied having power; and the fact that a man of knowledge had an ally was byitself proof that the operational goal of the teachings had been fulfilled.Since that goal was to show how to become a man of knowledge, and since a man ofknowledge was one who had an ally, another way of describing the operationalgoal of don Juan’s teachings was to say that they also showed how to obtain anally.The concept “man of knowledge”, as a sorcerer’s philosophical frame, had meaningfor anyone who wanted to live within that frame only insofar as he had an ally.I have classified this last component theme of man of knowledge as the secondmain structural unit because of its indispensability for explaining what a manof knowledge was.In don Juan’s teachings, there were two allies. The first was contained in theDatura plants commonly known as Jimson weed. Don Juan called that ally by one ofthe Spanish names of the plant, yerbadel diablo (devil’s weed). According to himany species of Datura was the container of the ally. Yet every sorcerer had togrow a patch of one species which he called his own, not only in the sense thatthe plants were his private property, but in the sense that they were personallyidentified with him.Don Juan’s own plants belonged to the species inoxia; there seemed to be nocorrelation, however, between that fact and differences that may have existedbetween the two species of Datura accessible to him.The second ally was contained in a mushroom I identified as belonging to thegenus Psilocybe; it was possibly Psilocybe mexicana, but the classification wasonly tentative because I was incapable of procuring a specimen for laboratoryanalysis.Don Juan called this ally humito (little smoke), suggesting that the ally wasanalogous to smoke or to the smoking mixture he made with the mushroom. Thesmoke was referred to as if it were the real container, yet he made it clearthat the power was associated with only one species of Psilocybe; thus specialcare was needed at the time of collecting in order not to confuse it with any ofa dozen other species of the same genus which grew in the same area.An ally as a meaningful concept included the following ideas and theirramifications: (1) an ally was formless; (2) an ally was perceived as a quality;(3) an ally was tamable; (4) an ally had a rule.An ally was formlessAn ally was believed to be an entity existing outside and independent ofoneself, yet in spite of being a separate entity an ally was believed to beformless. I have established “formlessness” as a condition that is the oppositeof “having definite form”, a distinction made in view of the fact that therewere other powers similar to an ally which had a definitely perceivable form. Anally’s condition of formlessness meant that it did not possess a distinct, or avaguely defined, or even a recognizable, form; and such a condition implied thatan ally was not visible at any time.An ally was perceived as a qualityA sequel to an ally’s formlessness was another condition expressed in the ideathat an ally was perceived only as a quality of the senses; that is to say,since an ally was formless its presence was noticed only by its effects on thesorcerer. Don Juan classified some of those effects as having anthropomorphicqualities. He depicted an ally as having the character of a human being, thusimplying that an individual sorcerer was in the position of choosing the mostsuitable ally by matching his own character with an ally’s allegedanthropomorphic characteristics.The two allies involved in the teachings were presented by don Juan as having aset of antithetical qualities.Don Juan categorized the ally contained in Datura inoxia as having twoqualities: it was woman-like, and it was a giver of superfluous power. Hethought these two qualities were thoroughly undesirable. His statements on thesubject were definite, but he indicated at the same time that his valuejudgement on the matter was merely a personalistic choice.The most important characteristic was undoubtedly what don Juan called itswoman-like nature. The fact that it was depicted as being woman-like did notmean, however, that the ally was a female power. It seemed that the analogy of awoman may have been only a metaphorical way don Juan used to describe what hethought to be the unpleasant effects of the ally. Besides, the Spanish name ofthe plant, yerba, because of its feminine gender, may have also helped to createthe female analogy. At any rate, the personification of this ally as awoman-like power ascribed to it the following anthropomorphic qualities: (1) itwas possessive; (2) it was violent; (3) it was unpredictable; and (4) it haddeleterious effects.Don Juan believed that the ally had the capacity to enslave the men who becameits followers; he explained this capacity as the quality of being possessive,which he correlated with a woman’s character. The ally possessed its followersby bestowing power on them, by creating a feeling of dependency, and by givingthem physical strength and well-being.This ally was also believed to be violent. Its woman-like violence was expressedin its forcing its followers to engage in disruptive acts of brute force. Andthis specific characteristic made it best suited for men of fierce natures whowanted to find in violence a key to personal power.Another woman-like characteristic was unpredictability. For don Juan it meantthat the ally’s effects were never consistent; rather, they were supposed tochange erratically, and there was no discernible way of predicting them. Theally’s inconsistency was to be counteracted by the sorcerer’s meticulous anddramatic care of every detail of its handling. Any unfavourable turn that wasunaccountable, as a result of error or mishandling, was explained as a result ofthe ally’s woman like unpredictability.Because of its possessiveness, violence, and unpredictability, this ally wasthought to have an overall deleterious effect on the character of its followers.Don Juan believed that the ally wilfully strove to transmit its woman-likecharacteristics, and that its effort to do so actually succeeded.But, alongside its woman-like nature, this ally had another facet which was alsoperceived as a quality: it was a giver of superfluous power. Don Juan was veryemphatic on this point, and he stressed that as a generous giver of power theally was unsurpassable. It was purported to furnish its followers with physicalstrength, a feeling of audacity, and the prowess to perform extraordinary deeds.In don Juan’s judgement, however, so exorbitant a power was superfluous; hestated that, for himself at least, there was no need of it any more.Nevertheless, he presented it as a strong incentive for a prospective man ofknowledge, should the latter have a natural inclination to seek power.Don Juan’s idiosyncratic point of view was that the ally contained in Psilocybemexicana, on the other hand, had the most adequate and most valuablecharacteristics: (1) it was male-like, and (2) it was a giver of ecstasy.He depicted this ally as being the antithesis of the one contained in Daturaplants. He considered it to be male-like, manly.Its condition of masculinity seemed to be analogous to the female-like conditionof the other ally; that is, it was not a male power, but don Juan classified itseffects in terms of what he considered to be manly behaviour. In this instance,too, the masculine gender of the Spanish word humito may have suggested theanalogy to a male power.The anthropomorphic qualities of this ally which don Juan judged to be proper toa man were the following: (1) it was dispassionate; (2) it was gentle; (3) itwas predictable; and (4) it had beneficial effects.Don Juan’s idea of the dispassionate nature of the ally was expressed in thebelief that it was fair, that it never actually demanded extravagant acts fromits followers. It never made men its slaves, because it did not bestow easypower on them; on the contrary, Humito was hard, but just, with its followers.The fact that the ally did not elicit overt violent behaviour made it gentle. Itwas supposed to induce a sensation of bodilessness, and thus don Juan presentedit as being calm, gentle, and a giver of peace.It was also predictable. Don Juan described its effects on all its individualfollowers and in the successive experiences of any single man as being constant;in other words, its effects did not vary or, if they did, they were so similarthat they were counted as being the same.As a consequence of being dispassionate, gentle, and predictable, this ally wasthought to have another manly characteristic: a beneficial effect on thecharacter of its followers. Humito’s manliness was supposed to create a veryrare condition of emotional stability in them. Don Juan believed that under theally’s guidance one would temper one’s heart and acquire balance.A corollary of all the ally’s manly characteristics was believed to be acapacity to give ecstasy. This other facet of its nature was perceived also as aquality. Humito was credited with removing the body of its followers, thusallowing them to execute specialized forms of activity pertinent to a state ofbodilessness. And don Juan maintained that those specialized forms of activityled unavoidably to a condition of ecstasy. The ally contained in thePsilocybe was said to be ideal for men whose natures predisposed them to seekcontemplation.An ally was tamableThe idea that an ally was tamable implied that as a power it had the potentialof being used. Don Juan explained it as an ally’s innate capacity of beingutilizable; after a sorcerer had tamed an ally he was thought to be in commandof its specialized power which meant that he could manipulate it to his ownadvantage.An ally’s capacity of being tamed was counterposed to the incapacity of otherpowers, which were similar to an ally except that they did not yield to beingmanipulated.The manipulation of an ally had two aspects: (1) an ally was a vehicle; (2) anally was a helper.An ally was a vehicle in the sense that it served to transport a sorcerer intothe realm of non-ordinary reality. Insofar as my personal knowledge wasconcerned, the allies both served as vehicles, although the function haddifferent implications for each of them.The overall undesirable qualities of the ally contained inDaturainoxia, especially its quality of unpredictability, turned it into adangerous, undependable vehicle. Ritual was the only possible protection againstits inconsistency, but that was never enough to ensure the ally’s stability; asorcerer using this ally as a vehicle had to wait for favourable omens beforeproceeding.The ally contained in Psilocybe mexicana, on the other hand, was thought to be asteady and predictable vehicle as a result of all its valuable qualities. As aconsequence of its predictability, a sorcerer using this ally did not need toengage in any kind of preparatory ritual.The other aspect of an ally’s manipulability was expressed in the idea that anally was a helper. To be a helper meant that an ally, after serving a sorcereras a vehicle, was again usable as an aid or a guide to assist him in achievingwhatever goal he had in mind in going into the realm of non-ordinary reality.In their capacity as helpers, the two allies had different, unique properties.The complexity and the applicability of these properties increased as oneadvanced on the learning path. But, in general terms, the ally contained inDatura inoxia was believed to be an extraordinary helper, and this capacity wasthought to be a corollary of its facility to give superfluous power. The allycontained in Psilocybe mexicana, however, was considered to be an even moreextraordinary helper. Don Juan thought it was matchless in the function of beinga helper, which he regarded as an extension of its overall valuable qualities.The Third UnitAN ALLY HAD A RULEAlone among the components of the concept “ally”, the idea that an ally had arule was indispensable for explaining what an ally was. Because of thatindispensability I have placed it as the third main unit in this structuralscheme.The rule, which don Juan called also the law, was the rigid organizing conceptregulating all the actions that had to be executed and the behaviour that had tobe observed throughout the process of handling an ally. The rule was transmittedverbally from teacher to apprentice, ideally without alteration, through thesustained interaction between them. The rule was thus more than a body ofregulations; it was, rather, a series of outlines of activity governing thecourse to be followed in the process of manipulating an ally.Undoubtedly many elements would have fulfilled don Juan’s definition of an allyas a “power capable of transporting a man beyond the boundaries of himself”.Anyone accepting that definition could reasonably have conceived that anythingpossessing such a capability would be an ally. And logically, even bodilyconditions produced by hunger, fatigue, illness, and the like could have servedas allies, for they might have possessed the capacity of transporting a manbeyond the realm of ordinary reality. But the idea that an ally had a ruleeliminated all these possibilities. An ally was a power that had a rule. All theother possibilities could not be considered as allies because they had no rule.As a concept the rule comprehended the following ideas and their variouscomponents: (1) the rule was inflexible; (2) the rule was non-cumulative; (3)the rule was corroborated in ordinary reality; (4) the rule was corroborated innon-ordinary reality; and (5) the rule was corroborated by special consensus.The rule was inflexibleThe outlines of activity forming the body of the rule were unavoidable stepsthat one had to follow in order to achieve the operational goal of theteachings. This compulsory quality of the rule was rendered in the idea that itwas inflexible. The inflexibility of the rule was intimately related to the ideaof efficacy. Dramatic exertion created an incessant battle for survival, andunder those conditions only the most effective act that one could perform wouldensure one’s survival. As individualistic points of reference were notpermitted, the rule prescribed the actions constituting the only alternative forsurvival. Thus the rule had to be inflexible; it had to require a definitecompliance to its dictum.Compliance with the rule, however, was not absolute. In the course of theteachings I recorded one instance in which its inflexibility was cancelled out.Don Juan explained that example of deviation as a special favour stemming fromdirect intervention of an ally. In this instance, owing to my unintentionalerror in handling the ally contained in Datura inoxia, the rule had beenbreached. Don Juan extrapolated from the occurrence that an ally had thecapacity to intervene directly and withhold the deleterious, and usually fatal,effect resulting from noncompliance with its rule. Such evidence of flexibilitywas thought to be always the product of a strong bond of affinity between theally and its follower.The rule was non-cumulativeThe assumption here was that all conceivable methods of manipulating an ally hadalready been used. Theoretically, the rule was non-cumulative; there was nopossibility of augmenting it.The idea of the non-cumulative nature of the rule was also relative to theconcept of efficacy. Since the rule prescribed the only effective alternativefor one’s personal survival, any attempt to change it or to alter its course byinnovation was considered to be not only a superfluous act, but a deadly one.One had only the possibility of adding to one’s personal knowledge of the rule,either under the teacher’s guidance or under the special guidance of the allyitself. The latter was considered to be an instance of direct acquisition ofknowledge, not an addition to the body of the rule.The rule was corroborated in ordinary realityCorroboration of the rule meant the act of verifying it, the act of attesting toits validity by confirming it pragmatically in an experimental manner. Becausethe rule dealt with situations of ordinary and of non-ordinary reality, itscorroboration took place in both areas.The situations of ordinary reality with which the rule dealt were most oftenremarkably uncommon situations, but, no matter how unusual they were, the rulewas corroborated in ordinary reality. For that reason it has been considered tofall beyond the scope of this work, and should properly be the realm of anotherstudy. That part of the rule concerned the details of the procedures employed inrecognizing, collecting, mixing, preparing, and caring for the power plants inwhich the allies were contained, the details of other procedures involved in theuses of such power plants, and other similar minutiae.The rule was corroborated in non-ordinary realityThe rule was also corroborated in non-ordinary reality, and the corroborationwas carried out in the same pragmatic, experimental manner of validation aswould have been employed in situations of ordinary reality. The idea of apragmatic corroboration involved two concepts: (1) meetings with the ally, whichI have called the states of non-ordinary reality; and (2) the specific purposesof the rule.The states of non-ordinary reality.—The two plants in which the allies were contained, when used in conformity withthe allies” respective rules, produced states of peculiar perception which donJuan classified as meetings with the ally. He placed extraordinary emphasis oneliciting them, an emphasis summed up in the idea that one had to meet with theally as many times as possible in order to verify its rule in a pragmatic,experimental manner. The assumption was that the proportion of the rule that waslikely to be verified was in direct correlation with the number of times one metwith the ally.The exclusive method of inducing a meeting with the ally was, naturally, throughthe appropriate use of the plant in which the ally was contained. Nonetheless,don Juan hinted that at a certain advanced stage of learning the meetings couldhave taken place without the use of the plant; that is to say, they could havebeen elicited by an act of volition alone.I have called the meetings with the ally states of non-ordinary reality. I chosethe term “non-ordinary reality” because it conformed with don Juan’s assertionthat such meetings took place in a continuum of reality, a reality that was onlyslightly different from the ordinary reality of everyday life. Consequently,non-ordinary reality had specific characteristics that could have been assessedin presumably equal terms by everyone. Don Juan never formulated thesecharacteristics in a definite manner, but his reticence seemed to stem from theidea that each man had to claim knowledge as a matter of personal nature.The following categories, which I consider the specific characteristics ofnon-ordinary reality, were drawn from my personal experience. Yet, in spite oftheir seemingly idiosyncratic origin, they were reinforced and developed by donJuan under the premises of his knowledge; he conducted his teachings as if thesecharacteristics were inherent in non-ordinary reality: (1) nonordinary realitywas utilizable; (2) non-ordinary reality had component elements.The first characteristics—that non-ordinary reality was utilizable—implied thatit was fit for actual service. Don Juan explained time and time again that theencompassing concern of his knowledge was the pursuit of practical results, andthat such a pursuit was pertinent in ordinary as well as in non-ordinaryreality. He maintained that in his knowledge there were the means of puttingnon-ordinary reality into service, in the same way as ordinary reality.According to that assertion, the states induced by the allies were elicited withthe deliberate intention of being used. In this particular instance don Juan’srationale was that the meetings with the allies were set up to learn theirsecrets, and this rationale served as a rigid guide to screen out otherpersonalistic motives that one may have had for seeking the states ofnon-ordinary reality.The second characteristic of non-ordinary reality was that it had componentelements. Those component elements were the items, the actions, and the eventsthat one perceived, seemingly with one’s senses, as being the content of a stateof non-ordinary reality. The total picture of non-ordinary reality was made upof elements that appeared to possess qualities both of the elements of ordinaryreality and of the components of an ordinary dream, although they were not on apar with either one.According to my personal judgement, the component elements of non-ordinaryreality had three unique characteristics: (1) stability, (2) singularity, and(3) lack of ordinary consensus.These qualities made them stand on their own as discrete units possessing anunmistakable individuality.The component elements of non-ordinary reality had stability in the sense thatthey were constant. In this respect they were similar to the component elementsof ordinary reality, for they neither shifted nor disappeared, as would thecomponent elements of ordinary dreams. It seemed as if every detail that made upa component element of non-ordinary reality had a concreteness of its own, aconcreteness I perceived as being extraordinarily stable. The stability was sopronounced that it allowed me to establish the criterion that, in non-ordinaryreality, one always possessed the capacity to come to a halt in order to examineany of the component elements for what appeared to be an indefinite length oftime. The application of this criterion permitted me to differentiate the statesof non-ordinary reality used by don Juan from other states of peculiarperception which may have appeared to be non-ordinary reality, but which did notyield to this criterion.The second exclusive characteristic of the component elements of non-ordinaryreality—their singularity—meant that every detail of the component elements wasa single, individual item; it seemed as if each detail was isolated from others,or as if details appeared one at a time. The singularity of the componentelements seemed further to create a unique necessity, which may have been commonto everybody: the imperative need, the urge, to amalgamate all isolated detailsinto a total scene, a total composite. Don Juan was obviously aware of that needand used it on every possible occasion.The third unique characteristic of the component elements, and the most dramaticof all, was their lack of ordinary consensus. One perceived the componentelements while being in a state of complete solitude, which was more like thealoneness of a man witnessing by himself an unfamiliar scene in ordinary realitythan like the solitude of dreaming. As the stability of the component elementsof non-ordinary reality enabled one to stop and examine any of them for whatappeared to be an indefinite length of time, it seemed almost as if they wereelements of everyday life; however, the difference between the componentelements of the two states of reality was their capacity for ordinary consensus.By ordinary consensus I mean the tacit or the implicit agreement on thecomponent elements of everyday life which fellow men give to one another invarious ways. For the component elements of non-ordinary reality, ordinaryconsensus was unattainable. In this respect non-ordinary reality was closer to astate of dreaming than to ordinary reality. And yet, because of their uniquecharacteristics of stability and singularity, the component elements ofnon-ordinary reality had a compelling quality of realness which seemed to fosterthe necessity of validating their existence in terms of consensus.The specific purpose of the rule.—The other component of the concept that the rule was verified in non-ordinaryreality was the idea that the rule had a specific purpose. That purpose was theachievement, by using an ally, of a utilitarian goal. In the context of donJuan’s teachings, it was assumed that the rule was learned by corroborating itin ordinary and non-ordinary reality. The decisive facet of the teachings was,however, corroboration of the rule in the states of non-ordinary reality; andwhat was corroborated in the actions and elements perceived in non-ordinaryreality was the specific purpose of the rule. That specific purpose dealt withthe ally’s power, that is, with the manipulation of an ally first as a vehicleand then as a helper, but don Juan always treated each instance of the specificpurpose of the rule as a single unit implicitly covering these two areas.Because the specific purpose referred to the manipulation of the ally’s power,it had an inseparable sequel—the manipulatory techniques.The manipulatory techniques were the actual procedures, the actual operations,undertaken in each instance involving the manipulation of an ally’s power. Theidea that an ally was manipulatable warranted its usefulness in the achievementof pragmatic goals, and the manipulatory techniques were the procedures thatsupposedly rendered the ally usable.Specific purpose and manipulatory techniques formed a single unit which asorcerer had to know exactly in order to command his ally with efficacy.Don Juan’s teachings included the following specific purposes of the two allies”rules. I have arranged them here in the same order in which he presented them tome.The first specific purpose that was verified in non-ordinary reality was testingwith the ally contained in Datura inoxia. The manipulatory technique wasingesting a potion made with a section of the root of the Datura plant.Ingesting that potion produced a shallow state of non-ordinary reality, whichdon Juan used for testing me in order to determine whether or not, as aprospective apprentice, I had affinity with the ally contained in the plant. Thepotion was supposed to produce either a sensation of unspecified physicalwell-being or a feeling of great discomfort, effects that don Juan judged to be,respectively, a sign of affinity or of the lack of it.The second specific purpose was divination. It was also part of the rule of theally contained in Datura inoxia. Don Juan considered divination to be a form ofspecialized movement, on the assumption that a sorcerer was transported by theally to a particular compartment of non-ordinary reality where he was capable ofdivining events that were otherwise unknown to him.The manipulatory technique of the second specific purpose was a process ofingestion-absorption. A potion made with Datura root was ingested, and anunguent made with Datura seeds was rubbed on the temporal and frontal areas ofthe head. I had used the term “ingestion-absorption” because ingestion mighthave been aided by skin absorption in producing a state of non-ordinary reality,or skin absorption might have been aided by ingestion.This manipulatory technique required the utilization of other elements besidesthe Datura plant, in this instance two lizards.They were supposed to serve the sorcerer as instruments of movement, meaninghere the peculiar perception of being in a particular realm in which one wascapable of hearing a lizard talk and then of visualizing whatever it had said.Don Juan explained such phenomena as the lizards answering the questions thathad been posed for divination.The third specific purpose of the rule of the ally contained in the Daturaplants dealt with another specialized form of movement, bodily flight. As donJuan explained, a sorcerer using this ally was capable of flying bodily overenormous distances; the bodily flight was the sorcerer’s capacity to movethrough nonordinary reality and then to return at will to ordinary reality.The manipulatory technique of the third specific purpose was also a process ofingestion-absorption. A potion made with Datura root was ingested, and anunguent made with Datura seeds was rubbed on the soles of the feet, on the innerpart of both legs, and on the genitals.The third specific purpose was not corroborated in depth; don Juan implied thathe had not disclosed other aspects of the manipulatory technique which wouldpermit a sorcerer to acquire a sense of direction while moving.The fourth specific purpose of the rule was testing, the ally being contained inPsilocybe mexicana. The testing was not intended to determine affinity or lackof affinity with the ally, but rather to be an unavoidable first trial, or thefirst meeting with the ally.The manipulatory technique for the fourth specific purpose utilized a smokingmixture made of dried mushrooms mixed with different parts of five other plants,none of which was known to have hallucinogenic properties. The rule placed theemphasis on the act of inhaling the smoke from the mixture; the teacher thusused the word humito (little smoke) to refer to the ally contained in it. But Ihave called this process “ingestion-inhalation” because it was a combination ofingesting first and then of inhaling. The mushrooms, because of their softness,dried into a very fine dust which was rather difficult to burn. The otheringredients turned into shreds upon drying.These shreds were incinerated in the pipe bowl while the mushroom powder, whichdid not burn so easily, was drawn into the mouth and ingested. Logically, thequantity of dried mushrooms ingested was larger than the quantity of shredsburned and inhaled.The effects of the first state of non-ordinary reality elicited byPsilocybemexicana gave rise to don Juan’s brief discussion of the fifth specificpurpose of the rule. It was concerned with movement—moving with the help of theally contained inPsilocybemexicana into and through inanimate objects or into and through animatebeings. The complete manipulatory technique may have included hypnoticsuggestion besides the process of ingestion-inhalation. Because don Juanpresented this specific purpose only as a brief discussion which was not furtherverified, it was impossible for me to assess correctly any of its aspects.The sixth specific purpose of the rule verified in non-ordinary reality, alsoinvolving the ally contained in Psilocybe mexicana, dealt with another aspect ofmovement—moving by adopting an alternate form. This aspect of movement wassubjected to the most intensive verification. Don Juan asserted that assiduouspractice was needed in order to master it. He maintained that the ally containedin Psilocybe mexicana had the inherent capacity to cause the sorcerer’s body todisappear; thus the idea of adopting an alternate form was a logical possibilityfor achieving movement under the conditions of bodilessness. Another logicalpossibility for achieving movement was, naturally, moving through objects andbeings, which don Juan had discussed briefly.The manipulatory technique of the sixth specific purpose of the rule includednot only ingestion-inhalation but also, according to all indications, hypnoticsuggestion. Don Juan had gut forth such a suggestion during the transitionalstages into nonordinary reality, and also during the early part of the states ofnon-ordinary reality. He classified the seemingly hypnotic process as being onlyhis personal supervision, meaning that he had not revealed to me the completemanipulatory technique at that particular time.The adoption of an alternate form did not mean that a sorcerer was free to take,on the spur of the moment, any form he wanted to take; on the contrary, itimplied a lifelong training to achieve a preconceived form. The preconceivedform don Juan had preferred to adopt was that of a crow, and consequently heemphazied that particular form in his teachings. He made it very clear,nonetheless, that a crow was his personal choice, and that there wereinnumerable other possible preconceived forms.The Fourth UnitTHE RULE WAS CORROBORATED BY SPECIAL CONSENSUSAmong the component concepts forming the rule, the one that was indispensablefor explaining it was the idea that the rule was corroborated by specialconsensus; all the other component concepts were insufficient by themselves forexplaining the meaning of the rule.Don Juan made it very clear that an ally was not bestowed on a sorcerer, butthat a sorcerer learned to manipulate the ally through the process ofcorroborating its rule. The complete learning process involved verification ofthe rule in non-ordinary reality as well as in ordinary reality. Yet the crucialfacet of don Juan’s teachings was corroboration of the rule in a pragmatic andexperimental manner in the context of what one perceived as being the componentelements of non-ordinary reality. But those component elements were not subjectto ordinary consensus, and if one was incapable of obtaining agreement on theirexistence, their perceived realness would have been only an illusion. As a manwould have to be by himself in non-ordinary reality, by reason of hissolitariness whatever he perceived would have to be idiosyncratic. Thesolitariness and the idiosyncrasies were a consequence of the assumed fact thatno fellow man could give one ordinary consensus on one’s perceptions.At this point don Juan brought in the most important constituent part of histeachings: he provided me with special consensus on the actions and the elementsI had perceived in nonordinary reality, actions and elements that were believedto corroborate the rule. In don Juan’s teachings, special consensus meant tacitor implicit agreement on the component elements of non-ordinary reality, whichhe, in his capacity as teacher, gave me as the apprentice of his knowledge. Thisspecial consensus was not in any way fraudulent or spurious, such as the one twopersons might give each other in describing the component elements of theirindividual dreams. The special consensus don Juan supplied was systematic, andto provide it he may have needed the totality of his knowledge. With theacquisition of systematic consensus the actions and the elements perceived innon-ordinary reality became consensually real, which meant, in don Juan’sclassificatory scheme, that the rule of the ally had been corroborated. The rulehad meaning as a concept, then, only inasmuch as it was subject to specialconsensus, for without special agreement about its corroboration the rule wouldhave been a purely idiosyncratic construct.Because of its indispensability for explaining the rule, I have made the ideathat the rule was corroborated by special consensus the fourth main unit of thisstructural scheme. This unit, because it was basically the interplay between twoindividuals, was composed of (1) the benefactor, or the guide into the knowledgebeing taught, the agent who supplied special consensus; (2) the apprentice, orthe subject for whom special consensus was provided.Failure or success in achieving the operational goal of the teachings rested onthis unit. Thus, special consensus was the precarious culmination of thefollowing process: A sorcerer had a distinctive feature, possession of an ally,which differentiated him from ordinary men. An ally was a power that had thespecial property of having a rule. And the unique characteristic of the rule wasits corroboration in non-ordinary reality by means of special consensus.The benefactorThe benefactor was the agent without whom the corroboration of the rule wouldhave been impossible. In order to provide special consensus, he performed thetwo tasks of (1) preparing the background for special consensus on thecorroboration of the rule, and (2) guiding special consensus.Preparing special consensusThe benefactor’s first task was to set the background necessary for bringingforth special consensus on corroboration of the rule.As my teacher, don Juan made me (1) experience other states of non-ordinaryreality which he explained as being quite apart from those elicited tocorroborate the rule of the allies; (2) participate with him in certain specialstates of ordinary reality which he seemed to have produced himself; and (3)recapitulate each experience in detail. Don Juan’s task of preparing specialconsensus consisted of strengthening and confirming the corroboration of therule by giving special consensus on the component elements of these new statesof non-ordinary reality, and on the component elements of the special states ofordinary reality.The other states of non-ordinary reality which don Juan made me experience wereinduced by the ingestion of the cactusLophophorawilliamsii, commonly known as peyote. Usually the top part of thecactus was cut off and stored until it had dried, and then it was chewed andingested, but under special circumstances the top part was ingested while it wasfresh. Ingestion, however, was not the only way to experience a state ofnonordinary reality with Lophophora williamsii. Don Juan suggested thatspontaneous states of non-ordinary reality occurred under unique conditions, andhe categorized them as gifts from or bestowals by the power contained in theplant.Non-ordinary reality induced by Lophophora williamsii had three distinctivefeatures: (1) it was believed to be produced by an entity called “Mescalito”;(2) it was utilizable; and (3) it had component elements.Mescalito was purported to be a unique power, similar to an ally in the sensethat it allowed one to transcend the boundaries of ordinary reality, but alsoquite different from an ally. Like an ally, Mescalito was contained in adefinite plant, the cactusLophophorawilliamsii. But unlike an ally, which was merely contained in a plant,Mescalito and this plant in which it was contained were the same; the plant wasthe centre of overt manifestations of respect, the recipient of profoundveneration. Don Juan firmly believed that under certain conditions, such as astate of profound acquiescence to Mescalito, the simple act of being contiguousto the cactus would induce a state of non-ordinary reality.But Mescalito did not have a rule, and for that reason it was not an ally eventhough it was capable of transporting a man outside the boundaries of ordinaryreality. Not having a rule not only barred Mescalito from being used as an ally,for without a rule it could not conceivably be manipulated, but also made it apower remarkably different from an ally.As a direct consequence of not having a rule, Mescalito was available to any manwithout the need of a long apprenticeship or the commitment to manipulatorytechniques, as with an ally.And because it was available without any training, Mescalito was said to be aprotector. To be a protector meant that it was accessible to anyone. YetMescalito as a protector was not accessible to every man, and with someindividuals it was not compatible. According to don Juan, such incompatibilitywas caused by the discrepancy between Mescalito’s “unbending morality” and theindividual’s own questionable character.Mescalito was also a teacher. It was supposed to exercise didactic functions. Itwas a director, a guide to proper behaviour.Mescalito taught the right way. Don Juan’s idea of the right way seemed to be asense of propriety, which consisted, not of righteousness in terms of morality,but of a tendency to simplify behavioural patterns in terms of the efficacypromoted by his teachings. Don Juan believed Mescalito taught simplification ofbehaviour.Mescalito was believed to be an entity. And as such it was purported to have adefinite form that was usually not constant or predictable. This quality impliedthat Mescalito was perceived differently not only by different men, but also bythe same man on different occasions. Don Juan expressed this idea in terms ofMescalito’s ability to adopt any conceivable form. For individuals with whom itwas compatible, however, it adopted an unchanging form after they had partakenof it over a period of years.The non-ordinary reality produced by Mescalito was utilizable, and in thisrespect was identical with that induced by an ally. The only difference was therationale don Juan used in his teachings for eliciting it: one was supposed toseek “Mescalito’s lessons on the right way”.The non-ordinary reality produced by Mescalito also had component elements, andhere again the states of non-ordinary reality induced by Mescalito and by anally were identical. In both, the characteristics of the component elements werestability, singularity, and lack of consensus.The other procedure don Juan used to prepare the background for specialconsensus was to make me the co-participant in special states of ordinaryreality. A special state of ordinary reality was a situation that could bedescribed in terms of the properties of everyday life, except that it might havebeen impossible to obtain ordinary consensus on its component elements. Don Juanprepared the background for the special consensus on the corroboration of therule by giving special consensus on the component elements of the special statesof ordinary reality. These component elements were elements of everyday lifewhose existence could be confirmed only by don Juan through special agreement.This was a supposition on my part, because as co-participant in the specialstate of ordinary reality I believed that only don Juan, as the otherco-participant, would know which component elements made up the special state ofordinary reality.In my own personal judgement, the special states of ordinary reality wereproduced by don Juan, although he never claimed to have done so. It seemed thathe produced them through a skilful manipulation of hints and suggestions toguide my behaviour. I have called that process the “manipulation of cues”.It had two aspects: (1) cuing about the environment, and (2) cuing aboutbehaviour.During the course of the teachings don Juan made me experience two such states.He may have produced the first through the process of cuing about theenvironment. Don Juan’s rationale for producing it was that I needed a test toprove my good intentions, and only after he had given me special consensus onits component elements did he consent to begin his teachings. By “cuing aboutthe environment” I meant that don Juan led me into a special state of ordinaryreality by isolating, through subtle suggestions, component elements of ordinaryreality which were part of the immediate physical surroundings. Elementsisolated in such a manner created in this instance a specific visual perceptionof colour, which don Juan tacitly verified.The second state of ordinary reality may have been produced by the process ofcuing about behaviour. Don Juan, through close association with me and throughthe exercise of a consistent way of behaving, had succeeded in creating an imageof himself, an image that served me as an essential pattern by which I couldrecognize him. Then, by performing certain specific choice responses, which wereirreconcilable with the image he had created, don Juan was capable of distortingthis essential pattern of recognition. The distortion may in turn have changedthe normal configuration of elements associated with the pattern into a new andincongruous pattern which could not be subjected to ordinary consensus; donJuan, as the co-participant of that special state of ordinary reality, was theonly person who knew which the component elements were, and thus he was the onlyperson who could give me agreement on their existence.Don Juan set up the second special state of ordinary reality also as a test, asa sort of recapitulation of his teachings. It seemed that both special states ofordinary reality marked a transition in the teachings. They seemed to be pointsof articulation. And the second state may have marked my entrance into a newstage of learning characterized by more direct co-participation between teacherand apprentice for purposes of arriving at special consensus.The third procedure that don Juan employed to prepare special consensus was tomake me render a detailed account of what I had experienced as an aftermath ofeach state of nonordinary reality and each special state of ordinary reality,and then to stress certain choice units which he isolated from the content of myaccount. The essential factor was directing the outcome of the states ofnon-ordinary reality, and my implicit assumption here was that thecharacteristics of the component elements of non-ordinary reality—stability,singularity, and lack of ordinary consensus—were inherent in them and were notthe result of don Juan’s guidance. This assumption was based on the observationthat the component elements of the first state of non-ordinary reality Iunderwent possessed the same three characteristics, and yet don Juan had hardlybegun his directing.Assuming, then, that these characteristics were inherent in the componentelements of non-ordinary reality in general, don Juan’s task consisted ofutilizing them as the basis for directing the outcome of each state ofnon-ordinary reality elicited by Datura inoxia, Psilocybe mexicana, andLophophora williamsii.The detailed account that don Juan made me render as the aftermath of each stateof non-ordinary reality was a recapitulation of the experience. It entailed ameticulous verbal rendition of what I had perceived during the course of eachstate. A recapitulation had two facets: (1) the recollection of events and (2)the description of perceived component elements. The recollection of events wasconcerned with the incidents I had seemingly perceived during the course of theexperience I was narrating: that is, the events that seemed to have happened andthe actions I seemed to have performed. The description of the perceivedcomponent elements was my account of the specific form and the specific detailof the component elements I seemed to have perceived.From each recapitulation of the experience don Juan selected certain units bymeans of the processes of (1) attaching importance to certain appropriate areasof my account and (2) denying all importance to other areas of my account. Theinterval between states of non-ordinary reality was the time when don Juanexpounded on the recapitulation of the experience.I have called the first process “emphasis” because it entailed a forcefulspeculation on the distinction between what don Juan had conceived as the goalsI should have accomplished in the state of non-ordinary reality and what I hadperceived myself.Emphasis meant, then, that don Juan isolated an area of my narrative by centringon it the bulk of his speculation. Emphasis was either positive or negative.Positive emphasis implied that don Juan was satisfied with a particular item Ihad perceived because it conformed with the goals he had expected me to achievein the state of non-ordinary reality. Negative emphasis meant that don Juan wasnot satisfied with what I had perceived because it may not have conformed withhis expectations or because he judged it insufficient. Nonetheless, he stillplaced the bulk of speculation on that area of my recapitulation in order toemphasize the negative value of my perception.The second selective process that don Juan employed was to deny all importanceto some areas of my account. I have called it “lack of emphasis” because it wasthe opposite and the counterbalance of emphasis. It seemed that by denyingimportance to the parts of my account pertaining to component elements which donJuan judged to be completely superfluous to the goal of his teachings, heliterally obliterated my perception of the same elements in the successivestates of non-ordinary reality.Guiding special consensusThe second aspect of don Juan’s task as a teacher was to guide special consensusby directing the outcome of each state of nonordinary reality and each specialstate of ordinary reality. Don Juan directed that outcome through an orderlymanipulation of the extrinsic and the intrinsic levels of non-ordinary reality,and of the intrinsic level of the special states of ordinary reality.The extrinsic level of non-ordinary reality pertained to its operativearrangement. It involved the mechanics, the steps leading into non-ordinaryreality proper. The extrinsic level had three discernible aspects: (1) thepreparatory period, (2) the transitional stages, and (3) the teacher’ssupervision.The preparatory period was the time that elapsed between one state ofnon-ordinary reality and the next. Don Juan used it to give me directinstructions and to develop the general course of his teachings. The preparatoryperiod was of critical importance in setting up the states of non-ordinaryreality, and because it pivoted on them it had two distinct facets: (1) theperiod prior to non-ordinary reality, and (2) the period following nonordinaryreality.The period prior to non-ordinary reality was a relatively short interval oftime, twenty-four hours at the most. In the states of non-ordinary realityinduced by Datura inoxia and Psilocybe mexicana the period was characterized bydon Juan’s dramatic and accelerated direct instructions on the specific purposeof the rule and on the manipulatory techniques I was supposed to corroborate inthe oncoming state of non-ordinary reality. WithLophophorawilliamsii the period was essentially a time of ritual behaviour,since Mescalito had no rule.The period following non-ordinary reality, on the other hand, was a long span oftime; usually lasting for months, it allowed time for don Juan’s discussion andclarification of the events that had taken place during the preceding state ofnon-ordinary reality. This period was especially important after the use ofLophophora williamsii. Because Mescalito did not have a rule, the goal pursuedin non-ordinary reality was the verification ofMescalito’s characteristics; don Juan delineated those characteristics duringthe long interval following each state of nonordinary reality.The second aspect of the extrinsic level was the transitional stages, whichmeant the passage from a state of ordinary reality into a state of non-ordinaryreality, and vice versa. The two states of reality overlapped in thesetransitional stages, and the criterion I used to differentiate the latter fromeither state of reality was that their component elements were blurred. I wasnever able to perceive them or to recollect them with precision.In terms of perceived time, the transitional stages were either abrupt or slow.In the instance of Datura inoxia, ordinary and non-ordinary states were almostjuxtaposed, and the transition from one to the other took place abruptly. Themost noticeable were the passages into non-ordinary reality. Psilocybe mexicana,on the other hand, elicited transitional stages that I perceived to be slow. Thepassage from ordinary into non-ordinary reality was specially long-drawn-out andperceivable. I was always more aware of it, perhaps because of my apprehensionabout forthcoming events.The transitional stages elicited by Lophophora williamsii seemed to combinefeatures of the other two. For one thing, both the passages into and out ofnon-ordinary reality were very noticeable. The entering into non-ordinaryreality was slow, and I experienced it with hardly any impairment of myfaculties; but reverting back into ordinary reality was an abrupt transitionalstage, which I perceived with clarity, but with less facility to assess everydetail of it.The third aspect of the extrinsic level was the teacher’s supervision or theactual help that I, as the apprentice, received in the course of experiencing astate of non-ordinary reality. I have set up supervision as a category by itselfbecause it was implied that the teacher would have to enter non-ordinary realitywith his apprentice at a certain point of the teachings.During the states of non-ordinary reality elicited by Datura inoxia I receivedminimal supervision. Don Juan placed heavy stress on fulfilling the steps of thepreparatory period, but after I had complied with that requirement he let meproceed by myself.In the non-ordinary reality induced by Psilocybe mexicana, the degree ofsupervision was the complete opposite, for here, according to don Juan, theapprentice needed the most extensive guidance and help. The corroboration of therule necessitated the adoption of an alternate form, which seemed to suggestthat I had to undergo a series of very specialized adjustments in perceiving thesurroundings. Don Juan produced those necessary adjustments through verbalcommands and suggestions during the transitional stages into non-ordinaryreality. Another aspect of his supervision was to direct me during the earlypart of the states of non-ordinary reality by commanding me to focus myattention on certain component elements of the preceding state of ordinaryreality. The items he focused upon were apparently chosen at random, as theimportant issue was the act of perfecting the adopted alternate form. The finalaspect of supervision was restoring me back to ordinary reality. It was implicitthat this operation also required maximal supervision from don Juan, although Icould not recall the actual procedure.The supervision necessary for the states induced by Lophophora williamsii was ablend of the other two. Don Juan remained at my side for as long as he could,yet he did not attempt in any way to direct me into or out of non-ordinaryreality.The second level of differentiative order in non-ordinary reality was theseemingly internal standards or the seemingly internal arrangement of itscomponent elements. I have called it the “intrinsic level”, and I have assumedhere that the component elements were subject to three general processes, whichseemed to be the product of don Juan’s guidance: (1) a progression towards thespecific; (2) a progression towards a more extensive range of appraisal; and (3)a progression towards a more pragmatic use of non-ordinary reality.The progression towards the specific was the apparent advance of the componentelements of each successive state of nonordinary reality towards being moreprecise, more specific. It entailed two separate aspects: (1) a progressiontowards specific single forms; and (2) a progression towards specific totalresults.The progression towards specific single forms implied that the componentelements were amorphously familiar in the early states of non-ordinary reality,and became specific and unfamiliar in the late states. The progression seemed toencompass two levels of change in the component elements of non-ordinaryreality: (1) a progressive complexity of perceived detail; and (2) a progressionfrom familiar to unfamiliar forms.Progressive complexity of detail meant that in each successive state ofnon-ordinary reality, the minute particulars I perceived as constituting thecomponent elements became more complex.I assessed complexity in terms of my being aware that the structure of thecomponent elements grew more complicated, yet the details did not becomeexceedingly or perplexingly entangled.The increasing complexity referred rather to the harmonious increase ofperceived detail, which ranged from my impressions of vague forms during theearly states to my perception of massive, elaborate arrays of minute particularsin the late states.The progression from familiar to unfamiliar forms implied that at first theforms of the component elements either were familiar forms found in ordinaryreality, or at least evoked the familiarity of everyday life. But in successivestates of nonordinary reality the specific forms, the details making up theform, and the patterns in which the component elements were combined becameprogressively unfamiliar, until I could not put them on a par with, nor couldthey even evoke, in some instances, anything I had ever perceived in ordinaryreality.The progression of the component elements towards specific total results was thegradually closer approximation of the total result I accomplished in each stateof non-ordinary reality to the total result don Juan sought, in matters ofcorroborating the rule; that is, non-ordinary reality was induced to corroboratethe rule, and the corroboration grew more specific in each successive attempt.The second general process of the intrinsic level of nonordinary reality was theprogression towards a more extensive range of appraisal. In other words, it wasthe gain I perceived in each successive state of non-ordinary reality towardsthe expansion of the area over which I could have exercised my capacity to focusattention. The point in question here was either that there existed a definitearea that expanded, or that my capacity to perceive seemed to increase in eachsuccessive state. Don Juan’s teachings fostered and reinforced the idea thatthere was an area that expanded, and I have called that alleged area the “rangeof appraisal”. Its progressive expansion consisted of a seemingly sensorialappraisal I made of the component elements of nonordinary reality which fellwithin a certain range. I evaluated and analysed these component elements, itseemed, with my senses, and to all appearances I perceived the range in whichthey occurred as being more extensive, more encompassing, in each successivestate.The range of appraisal was of two kinds: (1) the dependent range and (2) theindependent range. The dependent range was an area in which the componentelements were the items of the physical environment which had been within myawareness in the preceding state of ordinary reality. The independent range, onthe other hand, was the area in which the component elements of non-ordinaryreality seemed to come into existence by themselves, free of the influence ofthe physical surroundings of the preceding ordinary reality.Don Juan’s clear allusion in matters of the range of appraisal was that each ofthe two allies and Mescalito possessed the property of inducing both forms ofperception. Yet it seemed to me that Datura inoxia had a greater capacity toinduce an independent range, although in the facet of bodily flight, which I didnot perceive long enough to assess it, the range of appraisal was implicitly adependent one. Psilocybe mexicana had the capacity to produce a dependent range;Lophophora williamsii had the capacity to produce both.My assumption was that don Juan used those different properties in order toprepare special consensus. In other words, in the states produced by Daturainoxia the component elements lacking ordinary consensus existed independentlyof the preceding ordinary reality. With Psilocybe mexicana, lack of ordinaryconsensus involved component elements that depended on the environment of thepreceding ordinary reality. And with Lophophora williamsii, some componentelements were determined by the environment, whereas others were independent ofthe environment. Thus the use of the three plants together seemed to have beendesigned to create a broad perception of the lack of ordinary consensus on thecomponent elements of non-ordinary reality.The last process of the intrinsic level of non-ordinary reality was theprogression I perceived in each successive state towards a more pragmatic use ofnon-ordinary reality, This progression seemed to be correlated with the ideathat each new state was a more complex stage of learning, and that theincreasing complexity of each new stage required a more inclusive and pragmaticuse of non-ordinary reality. The progression was most noticeable when Lophophorawilliamsii was used; the simultaneous existence of a dependent and anindependent range of appraisal in each state made the pragmatic use ofnon-ordinary reality more extensive, for it covered both ranges at once.Directing the outcome of the special states of ordinary reality seemed toproduce an order in the intrinsic level, an order characterized by theprogression of the component elements towards the specific; that is to say, thecomponent elements were more numerous and were isolated more easily in eachsuccessive special state of ordinary reality. In the course of his teachings,don Juan elicited only two of them, but it was still possible for me to detectthat in the second it was easier for don Juan to isolate a large number ofcomponent elements, and that facility for specific results affected the rapiditywith which the second special state of ordinary reality was produced.The Conceptual OrderTHE APPRENTICEThe apprentice was the last unit of the operative order. The apprentice was inhis own right the unit that brought don Juan’s teachings into focus, for he hadto accept the totality of the special consensus given on the component elementsof all the states of non-ordinary reality and all the special states of ordinaryreality, before special consensus could become a meaningful concept. But specialconsensus, by force of being concerned with the actions and elements perceivedin non-ordinary reality, entailed a peculiar order of conceptualization, anorder that brought such perceived actions and elements into accordance withcorroboration of the rule. Therefore the acceptance of special consensus meantfor me, as the apprentice, the adoption of a certain point of view validated bythe totality of don Juan’s teachings; that is, it meant my entrance into aconceptual level, a level comprising an order of conceptualization that wouldrender the teachings understandable in their own terms. I have called it the“conceptual order” because it was the order that gave meaning to the unordinaryphenomena that formed don Juan’s knowlege; it was the matrix of meaning in whichall individual concepts brought out in his teachings were embedded.Taking into account, then, that the apprentice’s goal consisted of adopting thatorder of conceptualization, he had two alternatives: he could either fail in hisefforts or he could succeed.The first alternative, failure to adopt the conceptual order, meant also thatthe apprentice had failed to achieve the operational goal of the teachings. Theidea of failure was explained in the theme of the four symbolic enemies of a manof knowledge; it was implicit that failure was not merely the act ofdiscontinuing pursuit of the goal, but the act of abandoning the questcompletely under the pressure created by any one of the four symbolic enemies.The same theme also made it clear that the first two enemies—fear andclarity—were the cause of a man’s defeat at the apprentice’s level, that defeatat that level signified failure to learn how to command an ally, and that as aconsequence of such failure the apprentice had adopted the conceptual order in ashallow, fallacious manner. That is, his adoption of the conceptual order wasfallacious in the sense of being a fraudulent affiliation with or commitment tothe meaning propounded by the teachings. The idea was that upon being defeatedan apprentice, besides being incapable of commanding an ally, would be left withonly the knowledge of certain manipulatory techniques, plus the memory of theperceived component elements of non-ordinary reality, but he would not identifywith the rationale that might have made them meaningful in their own terms.Under these circumstances any man might be forced to develop his ownexplanations for idiosyncratically chosen areas of the phenomena he hadexperienced, and that process would entail the fallacious adoption of the pointof view propounded by don Juan’s teachings. Fallacious adoption of theconceptual order, however, was apparently not restricted to the apprenticealone.In the theme of the enemies of a man of knowledge, it was also implicit that aman, after having achieved the goal of learning to command an ally, could stillsuccumb to the onslaughts of his other two enemies—power and old age. In donJuan’s categorization scheme, such a defeat implied that a man had fallen into ashallow or fallacious adoption of the conceptual order, as had the defeatedapprentice.The successful adoption of the conceptual order, on the other hand, meant thatthe apprentice had achieved the operational goal—a bona fide adoption of thepoint of view propounded in the teachings. That is, his adoption of theconceptual order was bona fide in that it was a complete affiliation with, acomplete commitment to, the meaning expressed in that order ofconceptualization.Don Juan never clarified the exact point at which, or the exact way in which, anapprentice ceased to be an apprentice, although the allusion was clear that oncehe had achieved the operational goal of the system—that is, once he knew how tocommand an ally—he would no longer need the teacher for guidance. The idea thatthe time would come when a teacher’s directions would be superfluous impliedthat the apprentice would succeed in adopting the conceptual order, and in sodoing he would acquire the capacity to draw meaningful inferences without theteacher’s aid.Insofar as don Juan’s teachings were concerned, and until I discontinued myapprenticeship, the acceptance of special consensus seemed to entail theadoption of two units of the conceptual order: (1) the idea of a reality ofspecial consensus; (2) the idea that the reality of ordinary, everyday-lifeconsensus, and the reality of special consensus, had an equally pragmatic value.Reality of special consensusThe main body of don Juan’s teachings, as he himself stated, concerned the useof the three hallucinogenic plants with which he induced states of non-ordinaryreality. The use of these three plants seems to have been a matter of deliberateintent on his part. He seems to have employed them because each of thempossessed different hallucinogenic properties, which he interpreted as thedifferent inherent natures of the powers contained in them. By directing theextrinsic and intrinsic levels of nonordinary reality, don Juan exploited thedifferent hallucinogenic properties until they created in me, as the apprentice,the perception that non-ordinary reality was a perfectly defined area, a realmseparate from ordinary, everyday life whose inherent properties were revealed asI went along.Nevertheless, it was also possible that the allegedly different properties mighthave been merely the product of don Juan’s own process of directing theintrinsic order of non-ordinary reality, although in his teachings he exploitedthe idea that the power contained in each plant induced states of non-ordinaryreality which differed from one another. If the latter was true, theirdifferences in terms of the units of this analysis seem to have been in therange of appraisal which one could perceive in the states elicited by each ofthe three. Owing to the peculiarities of their range of appraisal, all threecontributed to producing the perception of a perfectly defined area or realm,consisting of two compartments : the independent range, called the realm of thelizards, or of Mescalito’s lessons; and the dependent range, referred to as thearea where one could move by one’s own means.I use the term “non-ordinary reality”, as already noted, in the sense ofextraordinary, uncommon reality. For a beginner apprentice such a reality was byall means unordinary, but the apprenticeship of don Juan’s knowledge demanded mycompulsory participation and my commitment to pragmatic and experimentalpractice of whatever I had learned. That meant that I, as the apprentice, had toexperience a number of states of nonordinary reality, and that firsthandknowledge would, sooner or later, make the classifications “ordinary” and“non-ordinary” meaningless for me. The bona fide adoption of the first unit ofthe conceptual order would have entailed, then, the idea that then was anotherseparate, but no longer unordinary, realm of reality, the “reality of specialconsensus”.Accepting as a major premise that the reality of special consensus was aseparate realm would have explained meaningfully the idea that the meetings withthe allies or with Mescalito took place in a realm that was not illusory.The reality of special consensus had pragmatic valueThe same process of directing the extrinsic and intrinsic levels of non-ordinaryreality, which seemed to have created the recognition of the reality of specialconsensus as a separate realm, appeared also to have been responsible for myperception that the reality of special consensus was practical and usable. Theacceptance of special consensus on all the states of non-ordinary reality, andon all the special states of ordinary reality, was designed to consolidate theawareness that it was equal to the reality of ordinary, everyday-life consensus.This equality was based on the impression that the reality of special consensuswas not a realm that could be equated with dreams. On the contrary, it hadstable component elements that were subject to special agreement. It wasactually a realm where one could perceive the surroundings in a deliberatemanner. Its component elements were not idiosyncratic or whimsical, but conciseitems or events whose existence was attested to by the whole body of teachings.The implication of the equality was clear in the treatment don Juan accorded tothe reality of special consensus, a treatment that was utilitarian and matter ofcourse; not at any time did he refer to it, nor was I required to behave towardsit in any but a utilitarian, matter-of-course way. The fact that the two areaswere considered equal, however, did not mean that at any moment one could havebehaved in exactly the same way in either area. On the contrary, a sorcerer’sbehaviour had to be different since each area of reality had qualities thatrendered it utilizable in its own way. The defining factor in terms of meaningseems to have been the idea that such an equality could be measured on thegrounds of practical utility. Thus, a sorcerer had to believe that it waspossible to shift back and forth from one area to the other, that both wereinherently utilizable, and that the only dissimilarity between the two was theirdifferent capacity for being used, that is, the different purposes they served.Yet their separateness seemed to be only an appropriate arrangement that waspertinent to my particular level of apprenticeship, which don Juan used formaking me aware that another realm of reality could exist. But from his acts,more than from his statements, I was led to believe that for a sorcerer therewas but one single continuum of reality which had two, or perhaps more than two,parts from which he drew inferences of pragmatic value. The bona fide adoptionof the idea that the reality of special consensus had pragmatic value would havegiven a meaningful perspective to movement.If I had accepted the idea that the reality of special consensus was usablebecause it possessed inherently utilizable properties which were as pragmatic asthose of the reality of everyday consensus, then it would have been logical forme to understand why don Juan exploited the notion of movement in the reality ofspecial consensus at such great length. After accepting the pragmatic existenceof another reality, the only thing a sorcerer had to do would be to learn themechanics of movement. Naturally, movement in that instance had to bespecialized because it was concerned with the inherent, pragmatic properties ofthe reality of special consensus.SUMMARYThe issues of my analysis have been the following:1. The fragment of don Juan’s teachings which I have presented here consisted oftwo aspects: the operative order or the meaningful sequence in which all theindividual concepts of his teachings were linked to one another, and theconceptual order or the matrix of meaning in which all the individual conceptsof his teaching were embedded.2. The operative order had four main units with their respective componentideas: (1) the concept “man of knowledge”; (2) the idea that a man of knowledgehad the aid of a specialized power called an ally; (3) the idea that an ally wasgoverned by a body of regulations called the rule; and (4) the idea that thecorroboration of the rule was subject to special consensus.3. These four units were related to one another in the following manner: thegoal of the operative order was to teach one how to become a man of knowledge; aman of knowledge was different from ordinary men because he had an ally; an allywas a specialized power, which had a rule; one could acquire or tame an allythrough the process of verifying its rule in the realm of non-ordinary realityand through obtaining special consensus on that corroboration.4. In the context of don Juan’s teachings, becoming a man of knowledge was not apermanent accomplishment, but rather a process. That is to say, the factor thatmade a man of knowledge was not solely the possession of an ally, but the man’slifelong struggle to maintain himself within the boundaries of a system ofbeliefs. Don Juan’s teachings, however, were aimed at practical results, and hispractical goal, in relation to teaching how to become a man of knowledge, was toteach how to acquire an ally through learning its rule. Thus the goal of theoperative order was to provide one with special consensus on the componentelements perceived in non-ordinary reality, which were considered to be thecorroboration of the ally’s rule.5. In order to provide special consensus on the corroboration of the ally’srule, don Juan had to provide special consensus on the component elements of allthe states of non-ordinary reality and the special states of ordinary realityelicited in the course of his teachings. Special consensus, therefore, dealtwith unordinary phenomena, a fact that permitted me to assume that anyapprentice, by accepting special consensus, was led into adopting the conceptualorder of the knowledge being taught.6. From the point of view of my personal stage of learning, I could deduce thatup to the time when I withdrew from the apprenticeship don Juan’s teachings hadfostered the adoption of two units of the conceptual order: (1) the idea thatthere was a separate realm of reality, another world, which I have called the“reality of special consensus”; (2) the idea that the reality of specialconsensus, or that other world, was as utilizable as the world of everyday life.Nearly six years after I had begun the apprenticeship, don Juan’s knowledgebecame a coherent whole for the first time. I realized that he had aimed atproviding a bona fide consensus on my personal findings, and although I did notcontinue because I was not, nor will I ever be, prepared to undergo the rigoursof such a training, my own way to meet his standards of personal exertion was myattempt to understand his teachings. I felt it was imperative to prove, if onlyto myself, that they were not an oddity.After I had arranged my structural scheme, and was capable of discarding manydata that were superfluous to my initial effort of uncovering the cogency of histeachings, it became clear to me that they had an internal cohesion, a logicalsequence that enabled me to view the entire phenomenon in a light that dispelledthe sense of bizarreness which was the mark of all I had experienced. It wasobvious to me then that my apprenticeship had been only the beginning of a verylong road. And the strenuous experiences I had undergone, which were sooverwhelming to me, were but a very small fragment of a system of logicalthought from which don Juan drew meaningful inferences for his day-today life, avastly complex system of beliefs in which inquiry was an experience leading toexultation.Appendix ATHE PROCESS OF VALIDATING SPECIAL CONSENSUSValidating special consensus involved, at every point, the cumulation of donJuan’s teachings. For the purpose of explaining the cumulative process, I havearranged the validation of special consensus according to the sequence in whichthe states of nonordinary reality and special ordinary reality occurred. DonJuan did not seem to have fixed the process of directing the intrinsic order ofnon-ordinary and special ordinary reality in an exact manner; he seemed to haveisolated the units for direction in a rather fluid way.Don Juan began to prepare the background for special consensus by producing thefirst special state of ordinary reality through the process of manipulating cuesabout the environment. He isolated by that method certain component elementsfrom the range of ordinary reality, and by isolating them, he directed me toperceive a progression towards the specific, in this instance the perception ofcolours that seemed to emanate from two small areas on the ground. Upon beingisolated those areas of colouration became deprived of ordinary consensus; itseemed that only I was capable of seeing them, and thus they created a specialstate of ordinary reality.Isolating those two areas on the ground by depriving them of ordinary consensusserved to establish the first link between ordinary and non-ordinary reality.Don Juan directed me to perceive a portion of ordinary reality in anunaccustomed manner; that is, he changed certain ordinary elements into itemsthat needed special consensus.The aftermath of the first special state of ordinary reality was myrecapitulation of the experience; from it don Juan selected the perception ofdifferent areas of colouration as the units for positive emphasis. He isolatedfor negative emphasis the account of my fear and fatigue, and the possibility ofmy lacking persistence.During the subsequent preparatory period he placed the bulk of speculation onthe units he had isolated, and he carried over the idea that it was possible todetect in the surroundings more than the usual. From the units drawn from myrecapitulation don Juan also introduced some of the component concepts of man ofknowledge.As the second step in preparing special consensus on the corroboration of therule, don Juan induced a state of non-ordinary reality with Lophophorawilliamsii. The total content of that first state of non-ordinary reality wasrather vague and disassociated, yet the component elements were very welldefined; I perceived its characteristics of stability, singularity, and lack ofordinary consensus almost as clearly as in later states. These characteristicswere not so obvious, perhaps because of my lack of proficiency; it was the firsttime I had experienced nonordinary reality.It was impossible to ascertain the effect of don Juan’s previous directing onthe actual course of the experience; however, his mastery in directing theoutcome of subsequent states of nonordinary reality was very clear from thatpoint on.From my recapitulation of the experience, he selected the units to direct theprogression towards specific single forms and specific total results. He tookthe account of my actions with a dog and connected it with the idea thatMescalito was a visible entity. It was capable of adopting any form; above allit was an entity outside oneself.The account of my actions also served don Juan in setting the progressiontowards a more extensive range of appraisal; in this instance the progressionwas towards a dependent range. Don Juan placed positive emphasis on the notionthat I had moved and acted in non-ordinary reality almost as I would have ineveryday life.The progression towards a more pragmatic use of nonordinary reality was set bygiving negative emphasis to the account of my incapacity to pay logicalattention to the perceived component elements. Don Juan hinted that it wouldhave been possible for me to examine the elements with detachment and accuracy;this idea brought forth two general characteristics of non-ordinary reality,that it was pragmatic and that it had component elements that could be assessedsensorially.The lack of ordinary consensus for the component elements was brought forthdramatically by an interplay of positive and negative emphasis placed on theviews of onlookers who observed my behaviour during the course of that firststate of nonordinary reality.The preparatory period following the first state of nonordinary reality lastedmore than a year. Don Juan employed that time to introduce more componentconcepts of man of knowledge, and to disclose some parts of the rule of the twoallies. He elicited also a shallow state of non-ordinary reality in order totest my affinity with the ally contained in Datura inoxia.Don Juan used whatever vague sensations I had in the course of that shallowstate to delineate the general characteristics of the ally by contrasting itwith what he had isolated as Mescalito’s perceivable characteristics.The third step in preparing the special consensus on the corroboration of therule was to elicit another state of non-ordinary reality with Lophophorawilliamsii. Don Juan’s previous directing seems to have guided me to perceivingthis second state of non-ordinary reality in the following manner:The progression towards the specific created the possibility of visualizing anentity whose form had changed remarkably, from the familiar shape of a dog inthe first state to the completely unfamiliar form of an anthropomorphiccomposite that existed, seemingly, outside myself.The progression towards a more extensive range of appraisal was evident in myperception of a journey. In the course of that journey the range of appraisalwas both dependent and independent, although a majority of the componentelements depended on the environment of the preceding state of ordinary reality.The progression towards a more pragmatic use of nonordinary reality was,perhaps, the most outstanding feature of my second state. It became evident tome, in a complex and detailed manner, that one could move around in non-ordinaryreality.I also examined the component elements with detachment and accuracy. I perceivedtheir stability, singularity, and lack of consensus very clearly.From my recapitulation of the experience, don Juan emphasized the following: Forthe progression towards the specific he gave positive emphasis to my accountthat I had seen Mescalito as an anthropomorphic composite. The bulk ofspeculation on this area was centred on the idea that Mescalito was capable ofbeing a teacher, and also a protector.In order to direct the progression towards a more extensive range of appraisal,don Juan placed positive emphasis on the account of my journey, which obviouslyhad taken place in the dependent range; he also put positive emphasis on myversion of the visionary scenes I viewed on the hand of Mescalito, scenes thatseemed to bc independent of the component elements of the preceding ordinaryreality.The account of my journey, and the scenes viewed on Mescalito’s hand, alsoenabled don Juan to direct the progression towards a more pragmatic use ofnon-ordinary reality. He first put forth the idea that it was possible to obtaindirection; second he interpreted the scenes as lessons concerning the right wayto live.Some areas of my recapitulation which dealt with the perception of superfluouscomposites were not emphasized at all, because they were not useful for settingthe direction of the intrinsic order.The next state of non-ordinary reality, the third one, was induced for thecorroboration of the rule with the ally contained in Datura inoxia. Thepreparatory period was important and noticeable for the first time. Don Juanpresented the manipulatory techniques and disclosed that the specific purpose Ihad to corroborate was divination.His previous directing of the three aspects of the intrinsic order seemed tohave produced the following results: The progression towards the specific wasmanifested in my capacity to perceive an ally as a quality; that is, I verifiedthe assertion that an ally was not visible at all. The progression towards thespecific also produced the peculiar perception of a series of images verysimilar to those I had viewed on Mescalito’s hand. Don Juan interpreted thesescenes as divination, or the corroboration of the specific purpose of the rule.Perceiving that series of scenes entailed also a progression towards a moreextensive range of appraisal. This time the range was independent of theenvironment of the preceding ordinary reality. The scenes did not appear to besuperimposed on the component elements, as had the images I viewed onMescalito’s hand; in fact, there were no other component elements besides thosethat were part of the scenes. In other words, the total range of appraisal wasindependent.The perception of a completely independent range also exhibited progressiontowards a more pragmatic use of nonordinary reality. Divining implied that onecould give a utilitarian value to whatever had been seen.For the purpose of directing the progression towards the specific, don Juan putpositive emphasis on the idea that it was impossible to move by one’s own meansin the independent range of appraisal. He explained movement there as beingindirect, and as being accomplished, in this particular instance, by the lizardsas instruments. In order to set the direction of the second aspect of theintrinsic level, the progression towards a more extensive range of appraisal, hecentred the bulk of speculation on the idea that the scenes I had perceived,which were the answers to divination, could have been examined and extended foras long as I wanted. For guiding the progression towards a more pragmatic use ofnon-ordinary reality, don Juan placed positive emphasis on the idea that thetopic to be divined had to be simple and direct in order to obtain a result thatcould be usable.The fourth state of non-ordinary reality was elicited also for the corroborationof the rule of the ally contained in Datura inoxia. The specific purpose of therule to be corroborated had to do with bodily flight as another aspect ofmovement.A result of directing the progression towards the specific may have been theperception of soaring bodily through the air. That sensation was acute, althoughit lacked the depth of all the earlier perceptions of acts that I had presumablyperformed in nonordinary reality. Bodily flight appeared to have taken place ina dependent range of appraisal, and it appeared to have entailed moving by one’sown power, which may have been the result of a progression towards a wider rangeof appraisal.Two other aspects of the sensation of soaring through the air may have been theproduct of directing the progression towards a more pragmatic use ofnon-ordinary reality. They were, first, the perception of distance, a perceptionthat created the feeling of an actual flight, and second, the possibility ofacquiring direction in the course of that alleged movement.During the subsequent preparatory period don Juan speculated on the supposedlydeleterious nature of the ally contained in Datura inoxia. And he isolated thefollowing areas of my account: For directing the progression towards thespecific, he placed positive emphasis on my recollection of having soaredthrough the air. Although I did not perceive the component elements of thatstate of non-ordinary reality with the clarity that was customary by then, mysensation of movement was very definite, and don Juan used it to reinforce thespecific result of movement. The progression towards a more pragmatic use ofnon-ordinary reality was established by centring the bulk of speculation on theidea that sorcerers could fly over enormous distances, a speculation that gaverise to the possibility that one could move in the dependent range of appraisaland then switch such movement over into ordinary reality.The fifth state of non-ordinary reality was produced by the ally contained inPsilocybe mexicana. It was the first time that the plant was used, and the statethat ensued was more in line with a test than with an attempt to corroborate therule. In the preparatory period don Juan presented only a manipulatorytechnique; as he did not disclose the specific purpose to be verified I did notbelieve the state was elicited to corroborate the rule. Yet the direction of theintrinsic level of non-ordinary reality set earlier appeared to have terminatedin the following results.Directing the progression towards specific total results produced in me theperception that the two allies were different from each other, and that each wasdifferent from Mescalito. I perceived the ally contained in Psilocybe mexicanaas a quality—formless and invisible, and producing a sensation of bodilessness.The progression towards a more extensive range of appraisal resulted in thesensation that the total environment of the preceding ordinary reality, whichremained within my awareness, was usable in non-ordinary reality; that is, theexpansion of the dependent range seemed to have covered everything. Theprogression towards a more pragmatic use of non-ordinary reality produced thepeculiar perception that I could go through the component elements within thedependent range of appraisal, in spite of the fact that they appeared to beordinary elements of everyday life.Don Juan did not demand the usual recapitulation of the experience; it was as ifthe absence of a specific purpose had made this state of non-ordinary realityonly a prolonged transitional stage. During the subsequent preparatory period,however, he speculated on certain observations he had made on my behaviourduring the course of the experience.He placed negative emphasis on the logical impasse that prevented my believingthat one could go through things or beings. With that speculation he directedthe progression towards a specific total result of movement through thecomponent elements of non-ordinary reality perceived within the dependent rangeof appraisal.Don Juan used those same observations to direct the second aspect of theintrinsic level, a more extensive range of appraisal.If movement through things and beings was possible, then the dependent range hadto expand accordingly; it had to cover the total environment of the precedingordinary reality which was within one’s awareness at any given time, sincemovement entailed a constant change of surroundings. In the same speculation itwas also implicit that non-ordinary reality could have been used in a morepragmatic manner. Moving through objects and beings implied a definite point ofadvantage which was inaccessible to a sorcerer in ordinary reality.Don Juan next used a series of three states of non-ordinary reality, elicited byLophophora williamsii, to prepare further the special consensus on thecorroboration of the rule. These three states have here been treated as a singleunit because they took place during four consecutive days, and during the fewhours in between them I had no communication whatsoever with don Juan. Theintrinsic order of the three estates has also been considered a single unit withthe following characteristics. The progression towards the specific produced theperception of Mescalito as a visible, anthropomorphic entity capable ofteaching. The ability to give lessons implied that Mescalito was capable ofacting towards people.The progression towards a more extensive range of appraisal reached a pointwhere I perceived both ranges at the same time, and I was incapable ofestablishing the difference between them except in terms of movement. In thedependent range it was possible for me to move by my own means and volition, butin the independent range I was able to move only with the aid of Mescalito as aninstrument. For example, Mescalito’s lessons comprised a series of scenes that Icould only watch. The progression towards a more pragmatic use of non-ordinaryreality was implicit in the idea that Mescalito could actually deliver lessonson the right way to live.During the preparatory period that followed the last state of non-ordinaryreality in this series, don Juan selected the following units. For theprogression towards the specific, he placed positive emphasis on the ideas thatMescalito was instrumental in moving one through the independent range ofappraisal, and that Mescalito was a didactic entity capable of deliveringlessons by allowing one to enter into a visionary world. He also speculated onthe implication that Mescalito had voiced its name and had supposedly taught mesome songs; those two instances were constructed as examples of Mescalito’scapacity to be a protector. And the fact that I had perceived Mescalito as alight was emphasized as the possibility that it might at last have adopted anabstract, permanent form for me.Stressing these same units also served don Juan in directing the progressiontowards a more extensive range of appraisal.During the course of the three states of non-ordinary reality I clearlyperceived that the dependent range and the independent range were two separateaspects of non-ordinary reality which were equally important. The independentrange was the area where Mescalito delivered its lessons, and since these statesof non-ordinary reality were supposed to have been elicited only to seek suchlessons, the independent range was, logically, an area of special importance.Mescalito was a protector and a teacher, which meant that it was visible; yetits form had nothing to do with the preceding state of ordinary reality. On theother hand, one was supposed to journey, to move in non-ordinary reality, inorder to seek Mescalito’s lessons, an idea that implied the importance of thedependent range.The progression towards a more pragmatic use of nonordinary reality was set bydevoting the bulk of speculation to Mescalito’s lessons. Don Juan constructedthese lessons as being indispensable to a man’s life; it was a clear inferencethat nonordinary reality could have been used in a more pragmatic manner to drawpoints of reference which had value in ordinary reality. It was the first timedon Juan had verbalized such an implication.The subsequent state of non-ordinary reality, the ninth in the teachings, wasinduced in order to corroborate the rule of the ally contained in Datura inoxia.The specific purpose to be corroborated in that state was concerned withdivination, and the previous direction of the intrinsic level ended in thefollowing points. The progression towards a specific total result created theperception of a coherent set of scenes, which were purported to be the voice ofthe lizard narrating the events to be divined, and the sensation of a voice thatactually described such scenes.The progression towards an independent range of appraisal resulted in theperception of an extensive and clear independent range that was free from theextraneous influence of ordinary reality. The progression towards a morepragmatic use of nonordinary reality ended in the utilitarian possibilities ofexploiting the independent range. That particular trend was set up by don Juan’sspeculation on the possibility of drawing points of reference from theindependent range and using them in ordinary reality. Thus the divinatory sceneshad an obvious pragmatic value, for they were thought to represent a view ofacts performed by others, acts to which one would have had no access by ordinarymeans.In the following preparatory period, don Juan emphasized more of the componentthemes of man of knowledge. He seemed to be getting ready to shift to thepursuit of only one of the two allies, the ally humito. Yet he gave positiveemphasis to the idea that I had a close affinity with the ally contained inDatura inoxia, because it had allowed me to witness an incidence of flexibilityof the rule when I had made an error in performing a manipulatory technique. Myassumption that don Juan was ready to abandon teaching the rule of the allycontained in Datura inoxia was fostered by the fact that he did not isolate anyareas of my recapitulation of the experience to account for directing theintrinsic level of the subsequent states of nonordinary reality.Next was a series of three states of non-ordinary reality elicited tocorroborate the rule of the ally contained in Psilocybe mexicana. They have beentreated here as a single unit. And although a considerable time elapsed inbetween them, during those intervals don Juan made no attempt to speculate onany aspect of their intrinsic order.The first state of the series was vague; it ended rapidly and its componentelements were not precise. It had the appearance of being more like atransitional stage than like a state of nonordinary reality proper.The second state had more depth. I perceived the transitional stage intonon-ordinary reality separately for the first time. During the course of thatfirst transitional stage don Juan revealed that the specific purpose of therule, which I had to corroborate, dealt with another aspect of movement, anaspect requiring his exhaustive supervision; I have rendered it as “moving byadopting an alternate form”. As a consequence, two aspects of the extrinsiclevel of non-ordinary reality became evident for the first time: thetransitional stages, and the teacher’s supervision.Don Juan used his supervision during that first transitional stage to pinpointthe subsequent direction of three aspects of the intrinsic level. His effortswere channelled, in the first place, to produce a specific total result byguiding me to experience the precise sensation of having adopted the shape of acrow.The possibility of adopting an alternate form in order to achieve movement innon-ordinary reality entailed in turn an expansion of the dependent range ofappraisal, the only area where such movement could take place.The pragmatic use of non-ordinary reality was determined by directing me tofocus my attention on certain component elements of the dependent range, inorder to use them as points of reference for moving.During the preparatory period that followed the second state of the series, donJuan refused to speculate on any part of my experience. He treated the secondstate as if it had been merely another prolonged transitional stage.The third state of the series, however, was paramount in the teachings. It was astate in which the process of directing the intrinsic level culminated in thefollowing results: The progression towards the specific created the easyperception that I had adopted an alternative form so completely that it eveninduced precise adjustments in the way I focused my eyes and in my way ofseeing. A result of those adjustments was my perception of a new facet of thedependent range of appraisal—the minutiae that formed the component elements—andthat perception definitely enlarged the range of appraisal. The progressiontowards a more pragmatic use of non-ordinary reality culminated in my awarenessthat it was possible to move in the dependent range as pragmatically as onewalks in ordinary reality.In the preparatory period following the last state of nonordinary reality, donJuan introduced a different type of recapitulation. He selected the areas forrecollection before he had heard my account; that is, he demanded to hear onlythe accounts that pertained to the pragmatic use of non-ordinary reality and tomovement.From such accounts he set the progression towards the specific by givingpositive emphasis to the version of how I had exploited the crow’s form. Yet heattached importance only to the idea of moving after having adopted that form.Movement was the area of my recapitulation on which he placed an interplay ofpositive and negative emphasis. He gave the account positive emphasis when itenhanced the idea of the pragmatic nature of non-ordinary reality, or when itdealt with the perception of component elements which had permitted me to obtaina general sense of orientation, while seemingly moving in the dependent range ofappraisal. He placed negative emphasis on my incapacity to recollect withprecision the nature or the direction of such movement.In directing the progression towards a wider range of appraisal, don Juancentred his speculation on my account of the peculiar way in which I hadperceived the minutiae that formed the component elements that were within thedependent range.His speculation led me to the assumption that, if it were possible to see theworld as a crow does, the dependent range of appraisal had to expand in depthand had to extend to cover the whole spectrum of ordinary reality.To direct the progression towards a more pragmatic use of non-ordinary reality,don Juan explained my peculiar way of perceiving the component elements as beinga crow’s way of seeing the world. And, logically, that way of seeing presupposedentrance into a range of phenomena beyond normal possibilities in ordinaryreality.The last experience recorded in my field notes was a special state of ordinaryreality; don Juan produced it by isolating component elements of ordinaryreality through the process of cuing about his own behaviour.The general processes used in directing the intrinsic level of non-ordinaryreality produced me following results during the course of the second specialstate of ordinary reality. The progression towards the specific resulted in theeasy isolation of many elements of ordinary reality. In the first special stateof ordinary reality, the very few component elements that were isolated throughthe process of cuing about the environment were also transformed into unfamiliarforms deprived of ordinary consensus; however, in the second special state ofordinary reality its component elements were numerous, and, although they didnot lose their quality of being familiar elements, they may have lost theircapacity for ordinary consensus. Such component elements covered, perhaps, thetotal environment that was within my awareness.Don Juan may have produced this second special state in order to strengthen thelink between ordinary and non-ordinary reality by developing the possibilitythat most, if not all, of the component elements of ordinary reality could losetheir capacity to have ordinary consensus.From my own point of view, however, that last special state was the finalsummation of my apprenticeship. The formidable impact of terror on the level ofsober consciousness had the peculiar quality of undermining the certainty thatthe reality of everyday life was implicitly real, the certainty that I, inmatters of ordinary reality, could provide myself with consensus indefinitely.Up to that point the course of my apprenticeship seemed to have been acontinuous building towards the collapse of that certainty. Don Juan used everyfacet of his dramatic exertion to accomplish the collapse during that lastspecial state, a fact prompting me to believe that complete collapse of thatcertainty would have removed the last barrier that kept me from accepting theexistence of a separate reality: the reality of special consensus.Appendix BOUTLINE FOR STRUCTURAL ANALYSISTHE OPERATIVE ORDERTHE FIRST UNIT> Man of Knowledge> To Become a Man of Knowledge Was a Matter of Learning> There were no overt requirements> There were some covert requirements> An apprentice was selected by an impersonal power> The one that was chosen (escogido)> The power’s decisions were indicated through omens> A Man of Knowledge Had Unbending Intent> Frugality> Soundness of judgement> Lack of freedom to innovate> A Man of Knowledge Had Clarity of Mind> Freedom to seek a path> Knowledge of the specific purpose> Being fluid> To Become a Man of Knowledge Was a Matter of Strenuous Labour> Dramatic exertion> Efficacy> Challenge> A Man of Knowledge Was a Warrior> He had to have respect> He had to have fear> He had to be wide-awake> Awareness of intent> Awareness of the expected flux> He had to be self-confident> To Become a Man of Knowledge Was an Unceasing Process> He had to renew the quest of becoming a man of knowledge> He was impermanent> He had to follow the path with heartTHE SECOND UNIT> A Man of Knowledge Had an Ally> An Ally Was Formless> An Ally Was Perceived as a Quality> The ally contained in Datura inoxia> It was woman-like> It was possessive> It was violent> It was unpredictable> It had a deleterious effect on the character of its fol lowers It was a giver> of superfluous power> The ally contained in Psilocybe mexicana> It was male-like It was dispassionate It was gentle It was predictable It was> beneficial to the character of its followers It was a giver of ecstasy> An Ally Was Tamable> An ally was a vehicle> The ally contained in Datura inoxia was unpredictable> The ally contained in Psilocybe mexicana was predict ble> An ally was a helperTHE THIRD UNITAn Ally Had a RuleThe Rule Was InflexibleException due to ally’s direct interventionThe Rule Was Non-cumulativeThe Rule Was Corroborated in Ordinary RealityThe Rule Was Corroborated in Non-ordinary RealityThe states of non-ordinary realityNon-ordinary reality was utilizableNon-ordinary reality had component elementsThe component elements had stabilityThey had singularityThey lacked ordinary consensusThe specific purposes of the ruleFirst specific purpose, testing (Datura inoxia)Manipulatory technique, ingestionSecond specific purpose, divination (Datura inoxia)Manipulatory technique, ingestion-absorptionThird specific purpose, bodily flight (Datura inoxia)Manipulatory technique, ingestion-absorptionFourth specific purpose, testing (Psilocybe mexicana)Manipulatory technique, ingestion-inhalationFifth specific purpose, movement (Psilocybe mexicana)Manipulatory technique, ingestion-inhalationSixth specific purpose, movement by adopting in alter nate form (Psilocybemexicana)Manipulatory technique, ingestion-inhalationTHE FOURTH UNIT> The Rule Was Corroborated by Special Consensus> TheBenefactor> Preparing special consensus> The other states of non-ordinary reality> They were produced by Mescalito It was contained> The container was the power itself> It did not have a rule It did not need apprenticeship It was a protector It> was a teacher It had a definite form> Non-ordinary reality was utilizable> Non-ordinary reality had component elements> The special states of ordinary reality> They were produced by the teacher> Cuing about the environment> Cuing about behaviour> The recapitulation of the experience> The recollection of events> The description of the component elements> Emphasis> Positive emphasis> Negative emphasis> Lack of emphasis> Guiding special consensus> The extrinsic level of non-ordinary reality> The preparatory period> The period prior to non-ordinary reality> The period following non-ordinary reality> The transitional stages> The teacher’s supervising> The intrinsic level of non-ordinary reality> Progression towards to specific> Specific single forms> Progressive complexity of perceived detail> Progressive from familiar to unfamiliar forms> Specific total results> Progression towards a more extensive range of ap praisal> Dependent range Independent range> Progression towards a more pragmatic use of non ordinary reality> Progression towards the specific in special states of ordinary realityTHE CONCEPTUAL ORDERTheApprenticeThe fallacious adoption of the conceptual orderThe bona fide adoption of the conceptual orderReality of special consensusThe reality of special consensus had pragmatic valuehttp://hotmix.narod.ru/"}]
