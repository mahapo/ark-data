Don Juan revealed to me as time went by that the shamans of ancient Mexico had conc eived of this collection of memorable events as a bona - fide device to stir caches of energy that exist within t he self.

Don Juan Matus's suggestion that I gather this collection of memorable events was made as if it were som ething casual, som ething that occurred to him on the spur of the moment. That was don Juan's style of teaching. He veiled the impor tance of certain maneuvers behind the munda ne. He hid, in this fashion, the sting of finality, presenting it as something no different from any of the concerns of everyday life.

"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 The prerequisite for this collection was the genuine and all - con sum ing act of putting together the sum total of one's emotions and realizations, withou t sparing anything. According to don Juan, the sham ans of his lineage were convi nced that the collection of memorable events was the vehicle for the emotional and energetic adjustment necessary for venturing, in terms of perception, into the unkno wn. Don Juan described the total goal of the shamanistic kno wledge that he handled as the preparation for facing the definitive journey: the jour ney that every hum an being has to take at the end of his life. He said that through their discipline and resolve, shamans were capable of retaining their individual awareness and purpose after death. For them, the vague, idealistic state that modem man calls \"life after death\" was a concrete region filled to capacity with practical affairs of a different order than the practi cal affairs of daily life, yet bearing a similar functional practicality. Don Juan considered that to collect the memorable events in their lives was, for shamans, the preparation for their entrance into that concrete region which they called the active si de of infinity. Don Juan and I were talking one afternoon under his ramada, a loos e structure made of thin po les of bamboo. It looke d like a roofed porch that was partially shaded from the sun but that would not provide protection at all from the rain. There were some small, sturdy freight boxe s there that served as benches. Their freight brands were faded, and appeared to be more ornament than iden tification. I was sitting on one of them. My back was against the front wall of the house. Don Juan was sitting on another box, lean ing against a pole that supported the ramada. I had just driven in a few minut es earlier. It had been a daylong ride in hot , hum id weather. I was nervous, fidgety, and sweaty."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Don Juan began talking to me as soon as I had comfortably set tled dow n on the box. With a broad smile, he com mented that ove rweight peopl e hardly ever kne w how to figh t fatness. The smile that played on his lips gave me an inkl ing that he wasn't being facetious. He was just pointing out to me, in a most direct and at the same time indirect way, that I was overweight. I became so nervous that I tipped over the freight box on which I was sitting and my back banged very hard against the thin wall of the hous e. The im pact shook the hous e to its founda tions . Don Juan looked at me inquiringly, but instead of asking me if I was all righ t, he assured me that I had not cracked the hous e. Then he expa nsively explained to me that his hous e was a tempor ary dw elling for him, th at he really lived som ewhere else. When I asked him where he really lived, he stared at me. His look was not belligerent; it was, rather, a firm deterrent to improper questions. I didn't com prehend what he wanted. I was about to ask the same question again , but he stopped me. \"Questions of that sort are not asked around here,\" he said firmly. \"Ask anyt hing you wish about procedur es or ideas. Whenever I'm ready to tell you where I live, if ever, I will tell you, without your having to ask me.\" 1 instantly fe lt rejected. My face turned red involuntarily. I was definitely offende d. Don Juan's expl osion of laught er adde d immensely to my chagrin. Not onl y had he rejected me, he had insulted me and then laughed at me. \"I live here temporarily,\" he went on, uncon cerned with my foul mood, \"because this is a magical center. In fact, I live here because of you.\" That statement unraveled me. I couldn't believe it. I thought that he was probably saying that to ease my irritation at being insulted. \"Do you really live here because of me?\" I finally asked him, unable to contain my curiosity."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 \"Yes,\" he said evenly. \"I have to groom you. You are like me. I will repeat to you now what I have already told you: The quest of every nagua l, or leader, in every generation of shamans, or sor cerers, is to find a new man or wom an who, like himself, shows a doubl e energetic structure; I saw this feature in you when we were in the bus depot in Noga les. When I see your energy, I see t wo balls of lum inos ity supe rimpos ed, one on top of the other, and that feature binds us toge ther. I can't refuse you any more than you can refuse me.\" His words caused a most strange agitation in me. An instant before I had been angry, now I wanted to weep . He went on, saying that he wanted to start me off on som e thing shamans called the warriors' way, backed by the strengt h of the area where he lived, which was the center of very strong emotions and reactions. Warlike peopl e had lived ther e for thou sands of years, soaking the land with their concern with war. He lived at that time in the state of Sonor a in nor thern Mexico, about a hundr ed miles sout h of the city of Guaym as. I always went there to visit him unde r the auspices of conduc ting my fieldwork. \"Do I need to enter into war, don Juan?\" I asked, genui nely worried after he declared that the conc ern with war was som e thing that I wou ld need som eday. I had already learned to take everything he said with the utmost seriousness. \"You bet your boot s,\" he replied, smiling. \"When you have absorbed all there is to be absorbed in this area, I'll move away.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 I had no grounds to doubt what he was saying, but I coul dn' t conc eive of him as living anyw here else. He was absolutely part of ev erything that surrounde d him. His hous e, how ever, seemed inde ed to be a tempor ary dw elling. It was a shack typi cal of the Yaqui farmers; it was made out of wattle and daub with a flat, thatched roof ; it had one big room for eating and sleeping and a roofle ss kitchen. \"It's very difficult to deal with ove rweight peopl e,\" he said. It seemed to be a non sequi tur, but it wasn't. Don Juan was simply goi ng back to the subj ect he had introduc ed before I had interrupt ed him by hitting my back on the wall of his hou se. \"A minut e ago, you hit my hous e like a demolition ball,\" he said, shaking his head slow ly from side to side. \"What an impact! An impact worthy of a por tly man.\" I had the unc om fortable feeling that he was talking to me from the poi nt of view of som eone who had given up on me. I imme diately took on a defensive attitude. He listened, smirking, to my frantic expl anations that my weight was nor mal for my bone structure. \"That's right ,\" he conc eded facetious ly. \"You have big bone s. You could probably carry thirty more pounds with great ease and no one, I assure you, no one, would notice. I would not notice.\" His mocking smile told me that I was definitely pudgy. He asked me then about my health in general, and I went on talk ing, desperately trying to get out of any further com ment about my weight. He changed the subject himself. \"What's new about your eccentricities and aberrations?\" he asked with a deadpan expression. I idiotically answered that they were okay. \"Eccentricities and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 aberrations \" was how he labeled my interest in being a collector. At that time, I had taken up, with renewed zeal, som ething that I had enjoyed doing all my life: collecting anyt hing collectib le. I collected magazines, stamps, records, World War II paraphernalia such as daggers, military helmets, flags, etc. \"All I can tell you , don Juan, about my aberrations , is that I'm trying to sell my collections,\" I said with the air of a martyr who is be ing forced to do something odious. \"To be a collector is not such a bad idea,\" he said as if he really believed it. \"The crux of the matter is not that you collect, but what you collect. You collect junk, worthless obj ects that im prison you as surely as y our pet dog doe s. You can't just up and leave if you have your pet to look after, or if you have to worry about what woul d happe n to your collections if you were not around.\" \"I'm serious ly loo king for buye rs, don Juan, believe me,\" I protested. \"No, no, n o, don' t feel that I'm accusing yo u of anyt hing, \" he retorted. \"In fact, I like your collector's spirit. I just don' t like you r collections , that's all. I woul d like, though, to enga ge your collector's eye. I woul d like to propo se to you a worthwhile col l ection.\" Don Juan paused for a long mom ent. He seemed to be in search of words; or perhaps it was onl y a dramatic, well - placed hesitation. He look ed at me with a deep, penetrating stare. \"Every warrior, as a matter of dut y, collects a special album ,\" don Juan went on, \"an album that reveals the warrior's personal ity, an album that attests to the circum stances of his life.\" \"Why do you call this a collection, don Juan?\" I asked in an argum entative tone . \"Or an album , fo r that matter?\" \"Because it is bot h,\" he retorted. \"But above all, it is like an album of pictures made out of memories, pictures made out of the recollection of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 memorable events.\" \"Are thos e memorable events memorable in som e specific way?\" I asked. \"They are memorable because they have a special signi ficance in one 's life,\" he said. \"My propos al is that you assemble this album by put ting in it the com plete account of various events that have had profound signi ficance for you.\" \"Every event in my life has had profound signi ficance for me, don Juan!\" I said forcefully, and felt instantly the impact of my own pomposity. \"Not really,\" he replied, smiling, apparently enjoying my reac tions immensely. \"Not every event in your life has had profound signi ficance f or you . There are a few, how ever, that I would con sider likely to have change d things for you, to have illum inated your path. Ordinarily, events that change our path are imper sonal affairs, and yet are extremely personal.\" \"I'm not trying to be difficult, don Juan, but believe me, every thing that has happe ned to me meets thos e qua lifications ,\" I said, knowing that I was lying. Immediately after voi cing this statement, I wanted to apol o gize, but don Juan didn' t pay attentio n to me. It was as if I hadn' t said a thing. \"Don' t think abou t this album in terms of banalities, or in terms of a trivial rehashing of your life expe riences,\" he said. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and tried to qui et my mind. I was talking to myself frantically about my insoluble prob lem: I most certainly didn' t like to visit don Juan at all. In his presence, I felt threatened. He verbally accosted me and didn' t leave me any room whatsoever to show my worth. I detested l os ing face every time I opened my mouth; I detested being the fool."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 But there was anot her voi ce inside me, a voice that came from a greater depth, more distant, almost faint. In the midst of my barrages of know n dialogu e, I heard myself saying that it was too late for me to turn back. But it wasn't really my voi ce or my thought s that I was expe riencing; it was, rather, like an unknow n voi ce that said I was too far gone into don Juan's world, and that I needed him more than I needed air. \"Say whatever you wish,\" the voi ce seemed to say to me, \"but if you were not the egom aniac that you are, you woul dn' t be so chagrined.\" \"That's the voi ce of your other mind, \" don Juan said, just as if he had been listening to or reading my thou ght s. My body jum ped invol untarily. My fright was so intense that tears came to my eyes. I conf essed to don Juan the whol e nature of my turmoil. \"Your conf lict is a very natural one,\" he said. \"And believe you me, I don' t exacerbate it that much. I'm not the t ype. I have som e stories to tell you abou t what my teacher, the nagual Julian, used to do to me. I detested him with my entire being.

Every one of us human beings has two minds. One is totally our s, and it is like a faint voi ce that always brings us order, directness, purpose. The other mind is a foreign installation. It brings us con flict, self - assertion, doubts, hopelessness.\" My fixation on my ow n mental concatenations was so intense that I"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 com pletely missed what don Juan had said. I coul d clearly remember every one of his words, but they had no meaning for me. Don Juan very calmly, and looki ng directly into my eyes, repeated what he had just said. 1 was still incapable of grasping what he meant. 1 coul dn' t focus my attention on his words. \"For som e strange reason, don Juan, I can't conc entrate on what you' re telling me,\" I said. \"1 unde rstand perfectly why you can't,\" he said, smiling expa n sively, \"and so will you, som eday, at the same time that you resolve the conf lict of whether you like me or not , the day you cease to be the me - me center of the world. \"In the meantime,\" he cont inue d, \"let's put the topi c of our two minds aside and go back to the idea of preparing your album of memorable events. I shoul d add that such an album is an exer cise in discipline and impartiality. Cons ider this albu m to be an act of war.\" Don Juan's assertion - that my conf lict of bot h liking and not liking to see him was goi ng to end whenever I abandone d my egoc entrism - was no solution for me. In fact, that assertion made me angr ier; it frustrated me all the more. And when 1 heard don Juan sp eak of the album as an act of war, I lashed out at him with all my poi son. \"The idea that this is a collection of events is already hard to unde rstand, \" I said in a tone of protest. \"But that on top of all this, you call it an album and say that such an al bum is an act of war is too much for me. It's too obs cure. Being obs cure makes the metaphor lose its meaning. \" \"How strange ! It's the oppos ite for me,\" don Juan replied calmly. \"Such an album being an act of war has all the meaning in the world for me. I w oul dn 't like my album of memorable events to be anyt hing but an act of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 war.\" I wanted to argue my poi nt further and expl ain to him that I did unde rstand the idea of an album of memorable events. I obj ected to the perplexing way he was describing it. I thou ght of myself in thos e days as an advoc ate of clarity and func tiona lism in the use of langua ge. Don Juan didn' t com ment on my belligerent mood. He onl y shook his head as if he were fully agreeing with me. After a while, I either com pletely ran out of energy , or I got a gigantic surge of it. All of a sudde n, without any effort on my part, I realized the futility of my out bur sts. I felt embarrassed no end. \"What pos sesses me to act the way I do? \" I asked don Juan in earnest. I was, at that instant, utterly baffled. I was so shaken by my realization that without any vol ition on my part, I began to weep. \"Don' t worry about stupi d details,\" don Juan said reassuringl y. \"Every one of us, male and female, is like this.\" \" Do you mean, don Juan, that we are naturally petty and con - tradictory?\" \"No, we are not naturally petty and cont radictory,\" he replied. \"Our pettiness and cont radictions are, rather, the result of a tran scende ntal conf lict that afflicts every one of us, b ut of which onl y sorcerers are painfully and hope lessly aware: the conf lict of our two minds .\" Don Juan peered at me; his eyes were like two black charcoals. \"You' ve been telling me on and on about our two minds ,\" I said, \"but my brain can't register what you are saying. Why? \" \"You' ll get to know why in due time,\" he said. \"For the pres ent, it will be sufficient that I repeat to you what I have said before about our two minds .

The other, the mind we use daily for everything we do, is a foreign installation. \" \"I think that the crux of the matter is that the conc ept of the mind being a foreign installation is so ou tlandi sh that my mind refuses to take it serious ly,\" I said, feeling that I had made a real discove ry. Don Juan did not com ment on what 1 had said. He cont inue d expl aining the issue of the two minds as if I hadn' t said a word. \"To resolve the conf lict of t he two minds is a matter of intend ing it,\" he said. \"Sorcerers beckon intent by voi cing the word intent loud and clear. Intent is a force that exists in the uni verse. When sorcerers beckon intent, it com es to them and sets up the path for attainm ent, whic h means that sorcerers always accom plish what they set out to do. \" \"Do you mean, don Juan, that sorcerers get anyt hing they want, even if it is som ething petty and arbitrary?\" I asked. \"No, I didn' t mean that. Intent can be called, of cour se, for anyt hing ,\" he replied, \"but sorcerers have found out , the hard way, that intent com es to them onl y for som ething that is abstract. That's the safety valve for sorcerers; otherwise they woul d be unbe arable. In your case, beckoni ng intent to resolve the conf lict of your two minds , or to hear the voi ce of your true mind, is not a petty or arbitrary matter. Quite the cont rary; it is ethereal and abstract, and yet as vital to you as anyt hing can be.\" Don Juan paused for a mom ent; then he began to talk again about the al bum . \"My ow n album , being an act of war, demande d a supe r - careful selection, \" he said. \"It is now a precise collection of the unf orgetable mom ents of my life, and everything that led me to them. I have conc entrated"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 in it what has been and will be meaningf u l to me. In my opi nion, a warrior's album is som ething most con crete, som ething so to the poi nt that it is shattering. \" I had no clue as to what don Juan wanted, and yet I did unde r stand him to perfection. He advi sed me to sit dow n, alone , and let my tho ught s, memories, and ideas com e to me freely. He rec om mende d that I make an effort to let the voi ce from the depths of me speak out and tell me what to select. Don Juan told me then to go inside the hous e and lie dow n on a bed that I had there. It was mad e of woode n boxe s and doz ens of empty bur lap sacks that served as a mattress. My whol e body ached, and when I lay on the bed it was actually extremely com fortable. I took his sugge stions to heart and began to think about my past, looki ng for events that ha d left a mark on me. I soon real ized that my assertion that every event in my life had been meaningf ul was nons ense. As I pressed myself to recollect, I found that I didn 't even know where to start. Through my mind ran endl ess disassociated thought s a nd memories of events that had happe ned to me, but I coul dn' t decide whether or not they had had any meaning for me. The impression I got was that not hing had had any signi ficance whatsoever. It looke d as if I had gone through life like a corpse empow ered to walk and talk, but not to feel anyt hing. Having no conc entration whatsoever to pur sue the subj ect beyond a shallow attempt, I gave up and fell asleep. \"Did you have any success?\" don Juan asked me when I woke up hour s later. Instead of being at ease aft er sleeping and resting, I was again moody and belligerent."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 \"No, I didn' t have any success!\" I barked. \"Did you hear that voi ce from the depths of you? \" he asked. \"I think I did,\" I lied. \"What did it say to you? \" he inqui red in an urgent tone . \"I can't think of it, don Juan,\" I muttered. \"Ah, you are back in your daily mind, \" he said and patted me forcefully on the back. \"Your daily mind has taken ove r again. Let's relax it by talking about you r collection of memorable events. I shoul d tell you that the selection of what to put in your album is not an easy matter. This is the reason I say that making this album is an act of war. You have to remake your self ten times ove r in order to know what to select.\" I clearly unde rstood then, if onl y for a s econd, that I had two minds ; how ever, the thought was so vague that I lost it instantly. What remained was just the sensation of an incapacity to fulfill don Juan's requi rement. Instead of gracious ly accepting my inca pacity, though, I allow ed it to becom e a threatening affair. The driving force of my life, in thos e days, was to appe ar always in a good light . To be incom petent was the equi valent of being a loser, som ething that was thor oughl y intolerable to me. Since I didn' t know how to respond to the chal lenge don Juan was pos ing, I did the onl y thing I kne w how to do: I got angr y. \"I've got to think a great deal more about this, don Juan,\" I said. \"I've got to give my mind som e time to settle on the idea.\" \"Of cour se, of cour se,\" don Juan assured me. \"Ta ke all the time in the world, but hur ry.\" Nothing else was said about the subj ect at that time. At hom e, I forgot about it com pletely unt il one day when, qui te abrupt ly, in the middl e of a lecture I was attendi ng, the imperious com mand to search for the m emorable"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 events of my life hit me like a bodi ly jolt, a nervous spasm that shook my entire body from head to toe . I began to work in earnest. It took me mont hs to rehash expe riences in my life that I believed were meaning ful to me. How ever, upon examining my collection, I realized that I was dealing onl y with ideas that had no subs tance whatsoever. The events I remembered were just vague poi nts of reference that I remembered a bstractly. Once again, I had the most uns ettling suspicion that I had been reared just to act without ever stoppi ng to feel anyt hing. One of the vague st events I recalled, which I wanted to make memorable at any cost, was the day I found out I had been adm itted to gradua te school at UCLA. No matter how hard I tried, I coul dn' t remember what I had been doi ng that day. There was not hing interesting or uni que about that day, except for the idea that it had to be memorable. Entering gradua te school shoul d have made me happy or proud of myself, but it didn' t. Anot her sample in my collection was the day I almost got married to Kay Condor . Her last name wasn't really Condor , but she had change d it because she wanted to be an actress. Her ticket to fame was that she actually looke d like Carole Lombard. That day was memorable in my mind, not so much because of the events that took place but because she was beautiful and wanted to marry me. She was a head taller than I was, which made her all the more interesting to me . I was thrilled with the idea of marrying a tall wom an, in a chur ch ceremony. I rented a gray tuxe do. The pants were qui te wide for my height . They were not bell - bot tom s; they were just wide,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 and that bot hered me no end. Anot her thing that annoye d me imme nsely was that the sleeves of the pink shirt I had bought for the occasion were about three inches too long; I had to use rubbe r bands to hol d them up. Outside of that, everything was perfect unt il the moment when the gue sts and I found out that Kay Condor had got ten cold feet and wasn't goi ng to show up. Being a very prope r young lady, she had sent me a not e of apol ogy by motorcycle messenge r. She wrote that she didn' t believe in divor ce, and coul dn' t com mit herself for the rest of her days to som eone who didn' t qui te share her views on life. She reminde d me that I snickered every time I said the name \"Condor ,\" som ething that show ed a total lack of respect for her person. She said that she had discussed the matter with her mother. Both of them love d me dear ly, but not enough to make me part of their family. She adde d that, bravely and wisely, we all had to cut our losses. My state of mind was one of total num bne ss. When I tried to recollect that day, I coul dn' t remember whether I felt hor ribly hu miliated at being left standi ng in fron t of a lot of peopl e in my gray, rented tuxe do with the wide - legge d pants, or whether I was crushed because Kay Condor didn' t marry me. These were the onl y two events I was capable of isolating with clarity. They were meager exam ples, but after rehashing them, I had succeeded in re - dressing them as tales of phi losophi cal acceptance. I thought of myself as a being who goe s through life with no real feelings , who has onl y intellectual views of every thing. Taking do n Juan's metaphor s as mode ls, I even con structed one of my ow n: a being who lives his life vicarious ly in terms of what it shoul d be.

It shoul d have been a devastating day for me, but it wasn't. At the mom ent of recollecting it, I kne w that there was not hin g there and began to work as hard as I coul d to cons truct what I shoul d have felt. The next time I went to don Juan's hous e I presented to him my two samples of memorable events as soon as I arrived. \"This is a pile of nons ense,\" he declared. \"None of it w ill do. The stories are related exclusively to you as a person who thinks , feels, cries, or doe sn't feel anyt hing at all. The memorable events of a shaman's album are affairs that will stand the test of time because they have not hing to do with him, and ye t he is in the thick of them. He'll always be in the thick of them, for the dur a tion of his life, and perhaps beyond, but not qui te persona lly.\" His words left me feeling dejected, totally defeated. I sincerely believed in thos e days that don Juan was an intransigent old man who fou nd special delight in making me feel stupi d. He reminde d me of a master craftsman I had met at a sculptor's found ry where I worked while goi ng to art school . The master artisan used to criticize and find flaws with everything hi s adva nced appr entices did, and woul d demand that they correct their work according to his recom menda tions .

Your story of the day you were adm itted to school is not hing but your assertion abou t you as the center of everything. You feel, you don' t feel; you realize, you don' t realize.

I thought that he meant som ething a bit morbid. Darkness meant that for me. And I related to him a story from my childhoo d. One of my older cous ins was in medical school .

Being the com petitive creature that I was, I believed that he was testing my endur ance, my manhood. 1 clenched my teeth and made up my mind to stay unt il the bitter end. The bitter end came in ways that I had not dreamed of. A corpse that w as cove red with a sheet actually move d up with a rattle on the marble table where all the corpses were lying, as if it were getting ready to sit up. It made a bur ping sound that was so awful it bur ned through me and will remain in my memory for the rest of my life.

His heart did not grow at the same ra te as the rest of his body and one day he died of heart failure. I went with anot her boy to the mortuary out of morbid curiosity. The morti - cian, who was perhaps more morbid than the two of us, ope ned the back door and let us in. He show ed us his masterpie ce. He had put the gigantic boy, who had been ove r seven feet, seven inches tall, into a coffin for a nor mal person by sawing off his legs. He show ed us how he had arrange d his legs as if the dead boy were hol ding them with his arms like two trophi es. The fright I expe rienced was com parable to the fright I had expe rienced in the morgue as a child, but this new fright was not a phys ical reaction; it was a reaction of psychol ogi cal revul sion. \"You' re almost there,\" don Juan said. \"How ever, your story is still too persona l. It's revol ting. It makes me sick, but I see great pot ential.\" Don Juan and I laughe d at the hor ror found in situations of everyda y life. By then I was hope lessly lost in the morbid strands I had caught and released. I told him then the story of my best friend, Roy Goldpi ss. He actually had a Polish surname, but his friends called him Goldpi ss because whatever he touc hed, he turned to gol d; he was a great bus inessman. His talent for bus iness made him a supe r - ambitious being. He wanted to be th e richest man in the world. How ever, he found that the com petition was too tough.

It didn' t bot her me as it woul d have if it had happe ned in the world of everyday life, or right after I had arrived at his hous e. After a very long silence, don Juan spoke to me again. \"I'll do better than give you an example of a memorable event from my album ,\" he said. \"I'll give you a memorable event from your ow n life, one that shoul d go for sure in your collection.

He out fit ted me with an old straw hat, as he alway s did whenever we went out in the heat of the sun. We walked for a long time in com plete silence. I tried to the best of my ability to force myself to remember all the details of the story. It was mid afternoo n when we sat dow n unde r the shade of som e tall bus hes, and I retold the full story. Years before, while I was studyi ng sculpture in a fine arts school in Italy, I had a close friend, a Scotsman who was studyi ng art in order to becom e an art critic. What stood out most vividly in my mind about him, and had to do with the story I was telling don Juan, was the bom bastic idea he had of himself; he thought he was the most licentious , lusty, all - around schol ar and crafts man, a man of the Renaissance. Licentious he was, but lustiness was som ething in com plet e cont radiction to his bony, dry, serious person. He was a vicarious follow er of the Engl ish phi losophe r Bertrand Russell and dreamed of appl ying the principles of logi cal pos itivism to art criticism. To be an all - aroun d schol ar and craftsman was perhaps his wildest fantasy because he was a procrastinator; work was his nemesis. His dubi ous specialty wasn't art criticism, but his persona l know ledge of all the prostitutes of the local bor dellos, of which there were plenty. The colorful and lengt hy account s h e used to give me - in order to keep me, according to him, up to date about all the marvelous things he did in the world of his spe cialty - were delight ful. It was not surprising to me, therefore, that one day he came to my apartment, all excited, nearly out of breath, and told me that som ething extraordinary had happe ned to him and that he wanted to share it with me. \"I say, old man, you must see this for your self!\" he said excit edly in"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 the Oxford accent he affected every time he talked to me.

I am goi ng to give you a marvelous gift for life. Do you unde rstand? \" I unde rstood that he was a hys teri cal Scotsman. It was always my pleasure to hum or him and tag along. I had never regretted it. \"Calm dow n, calm dow n, Eddi e,\" I said. \"What are you trying to tell me?” He related to me that he had been in a bor dello, where he had found an unbe lievable w om an who did an incredible thing she called \"figur es in front of a mirror.\" He assured me repeatedly, almost stuttering, that I ow ed it to myself to expe rience this unbe lievable event persona lly. \"I say, don' t worry about mone y!\" he said, since he kne w I d idn' t have any. \"I've already paid the price.

I was more than willing to participate in his new delight . Eddi e drove me to the out skirts of the city. We stoppe d in front of a dus ty , badly kept bui lding; the paint was peeling off the walls.

At the entrance to the bui lding were two dark, shady - looki ng men wearing poi nted black shoe s that seemed too tight on their feet; they greeted Eddi e effusively. They had black, shifty, menacing eyes. Both of them were wearing shiny light - blue suits, also too tight for their bul ky bodi es. One of them ope ned the door for Eddi e. They didn 't even look at me. We went up two flight s of stairs on a dilapidated staircase that at one time must have been luxur ious . Eddi e led the way and walked the lengt h of an empty, hot ellike corridor with doo rs on bot h sides. All the door s were painted in the same drab, dark, olive green. Every doo r had a brass num ber, tarnished with age, barely visible against the painted wood. Eddi e stoppe d in front of a door . I not iced the num ber 112 on it. He rappe d repeatedly. The door ope ned, and a round, shor t wom an with bleached - blon de hair beckone d us in witho ut saying a word.

He acted as if he were most calm, yet I not iced his unc ons cious gestures of being ill at ease. \"How are you toda y, Madame Ludm illa?\" he said, trying to sound like an American and flubbi ng it.

Madame Ludm illa didn' t seem perturbed at all by my exp losion of mirth. Eddi e kissed Madame Ludm illa's hand again and left. \"You speak Engl ish, my boy? \" she shout ed as if I were deaf. \"You look Eyipcian, or perhaps Torkish.\" I assured Madame Ludm illa that I was neither, and that I did speak Engl ish. She asked me then if I fancied her \"figur es in front of a mirror.\" I didn' t kno w what to say. I just shook my head affirmatively. \"I give you good show ,\" she assured me. \"Figur es in front of a mirror is onl y foreplay.

There was a profusion of obj ects aroun d the room : pieces of furniture like small chests of drawers, antique tables and chairs; a roll - top desk set against the wall and crammed with papers, pencils, rulers, and at least a doz en pai rs of scissors. Madame Ludm illa made me sit dow n on an old stuffed chair. \"The bed is in the other room , darling, \" she said, poi nting to the other side of the room . \"This is my ant isala.

She put on a record. The music was a haunt ing melody that reminde d me of a circus march. \"And now my show ,\" she said, and began to twirl around to the accom paniment of the haunt ing melody. The skin of Madame L udm illa's body was tight , for the most part, and extra ordinarily white, though she was not young. She must have been in her well - lived late forties. Her belly sagge d, not a great deal, but a bit, and so did her vol um ino us breasts. The skin of her face als o sagge d into not iceable jow ls. She had a small nos e and heavily painted red lips. She wore thick black mascara. She brought to mind the prototype of an aging prostitute. Yet there was som e thing childlike about her, a girlish abandon and trust, a sweet ne ss that jolted me. \"And now , figur es in front of a mirror,\" Madame Ludm illa announc ed while the music cont inue d. \"Leg, leg, leg!\" she said, kicking one leg up in the air, and then the other, in time with the music.

She repeated the seque nce ove r and ove r unt il the music began to fade when the Victrola's spring wou nd dow n.

I was bent on climbing the academic ladde r, and in my calculations , I had determined that the first step was to collect data on the uses of medicinal plants by the Indi ans of the sout hw estern United States. I first asked a professor of anthrop ology who had worked in that area for advi ce about my project. He was a prom inent ethnol ogi st who had publ ished extensively in the late thirties and earl y for ties on the California Indi ans and the Indi ans of the Sout hw est and Sonor a, Mexico. He patiently listened to my expos ition. My idea was to write a paper, call it \"Ethnobo tanical Data,\" and pub lish it in a jour nal that dealt exclusively with anthropo logi cal issues of the sout hw estern United States. I propos ed to collect medicinal plants, take the samples to the Botanical Garden at UCLA to be prope rly identified, and then describe why and how the Indi ans of the Sout hw est used them.

Now it was a worried face. I believed that he worried because he was losing his hair, but at times it seemed to me that it was som ething more than that. And it wasn't that he was fatter; his body was heavy in ways that were impos sible to expl ain. I not iced it in the way that he walked, and got up, an d sat dow n. Bill seemed to me to be fight ing gravity with every fiber of his being, in everything he did. Disregarding my feelings of defeat, I started on a jour ney with him. We visited every place in Arizona and New Mexico where there were Indi ans. One of the end results of this trip was that I found out that my anthropo logi st friend had two definite facets to his person. He expl ained to me that his opi nions as a professiona l anthropol ogi st were very measured, and congr uous with the anthropol og ical tho ught of the day, but that as a private person, his anthropol ogi cal fieldw ork had given him a wealth of"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 expe ri ences that he never talked about .

On anot her occasion, he conf ided that the shamans o f the Sout hw est were capable of transforming themselves into different entities, and that the categor ization schemes of \"bear shaman\" or \"mount ain lion shaman,\" etc., shoul d not be taken as euphe misms or metaphor s because they were not .

Prior to entering the water, he had whispered in my ear that 1 shoul d go dow nstream and wait for him. He told me the exact spot to wait. I, of cour se, didn' t believe a word of what he was saying, so at first I coul dn' t remember where he had said I had to wait for him, but then I found the spot and I saw the shaman com ing out of the water. It sounds stupi d to say 'com ing ou t of the water.' I saw the shaman tur ning into water and then being remade out of the water. Can you believe that?\" I had no com ments on his stories. It was impos sible for me to believe him, but I coul d not disbelieve him either. He was a very serious man.

I have never seen this happe n, but I kne w a cloud shaman. I never saw him disappe aring or turning into mist in fron t of my eyes as I saw that other shaman turning into water right in front of me. But I chased that cloud shaman onc e, and he simply vanished in an area where there was no place for him to hide. Althou gh I didn 't see him turning into a cloud, he disap - peared .

As a seconda ry theme, I mentione d to the old man that I kne w that he was a shaman. I conc lude d by assuring him that it woul d be thor oughl y benefici al for him to talk to me at lengt h. \"If not hing else,\" I said petulantly, \"we could swap stories.

He raised his hand to the height of my lips as if to prevent m e from saying it. At that instant, a bus pul led up to the bus stop. The old man muttered that it was the bus he had to take, then he earnestly asked me to look him up so we coul d talk with more ease and swap stories. There was an ironi c smirk on the com er of his mout h when he said that.

Except for Bill's casual remarks, I didn' t have any conc eption of how dif ficult it was to appr oach that old man, and I coul dn' t have cared less.

He didn't really appe ar to be that old, although he was definitely old. He pos sessed a tremendo us vigor and agility. 1 felt that Bill woul d have failed miserably if he had tried to punc h him in the nos e. That old Indi an was pow erful. In fact, he was dow nright scary. I didn' t vo ice my thought s.

One of the men adde d that the old man was cont empor aneous with his grandf ather, but that while his grandf ather was senile a nd bedridde n, the sorcerer seemed to be more vigor ous than ever.

I described the old man and said that his name was Juan Matus, and that other peo ple had characterized him as a shaman. Jorge Campos smiled at me broadly. I asked him if he kne w the old man. \"Ah, yes, I know him,\" he said jovi ally. \"You may say that we are good friends.\" Without being invi ted, Jorge Campos came into the room and sat dow n at the table just inside the balcony . \"Does he live around here?\" I asked. \"He certainly doe s, \" he assured me. \"Woul d you take me to him?\" \"I don' t see why not ,\" he said. \"I woul d need a coupl e of days to make my ow n inqui ries, just to make sure that he is there, and then we will go and see him.\" I kne w that he was lying, yet I didn' t want to belie ve it.

Then he shifted the conve rsation to the old man, and what he said was in total cont radiction to what others had said to me about the man. While they had described him as a hermit and retired sham an, Jorge Campos por trayed him as the most prom i nent curer and sorcerer of the area, a man whos e fame had turned him into a nearly inaccessible figur e. He paused, like an actor, and then he delivered his blow : He said that to talk to the old man on a stea dy basis, the way anthropol ogi sts like to do, was goi ng to cost me at least two thous and dol lars.

By hol ding the piece of wood in place with the pressure of his feet, he had fash ione d a stupe ndous pot ter' s turning wheel, so to speak. His feet turned the piece as his hands worked the chisel. I had never seen anyt hing like this in my life. He was making a mask, hol low ing it with a curved chisel. His cont rol of his feet in hol ding the wood and turning it arou nd was remarkable. The man was very thin; he had a thin face with angul ar fea tures, high cheekbone s, and a dark, coppe rish com plexion. The skin of his face and neck seemed to be stretched to the maximum.

THE PART OF my account of meeting don Juan that he didn' t want to hear about was my feelings and impressions on that fate ful day when I walked into his hous e: the cont radictory clash between my expe ctations and the reality of the situation, and the effect that was caused in me by a cluster of the most extravagant ideas I had ever heard. \"That is more in the line of conf ession than in the line of events,\" he had said to me onc e when I tried to tell him about all this. \"You coul dn' t be more wrong, don Juan,\" I began, but I stoppe d. Som ething in the way he looke d at me made me realize that he was right . Whatever I was goi ng to say coul d have sounde d onl y like lip service, flattery. What had taken place on our first real m eeting, how ever, was of transcende ntal impo rtance to me, an event of ultimate cons eque nce. During my first encount er with don Juan, in the bus depot in Noga les, Arizona , som ething of an unus ual nature had happe ned to me, but it had com e to me cushione d in my conc erns with the presentation of the self. I had wanted to impress don Juan, and in attempting to do so I had focused all my attention on the act of selling my wares, so to speak. It was onl y mont hs later that a strange residue of forgot ten events bega n to appe ar. One day, out of now here, and with no coaxing or coaching on my part, I recollected with extraordinary clarity som ething that had com pletely bypa ssed me dur ing my actual encount er with don Juan. When he had stoppe d me from telling him my name, he had peered into my eyes and had num bed me with his look. There was infinitely more that 1 coul d have said"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 to him about myself. I coul d have expound ed on my know ledge and worth for hou rs if his look hadn' t com pletely cut me off. In light of this new real ization, I recons idered everything that had happe ned to me on that occasion. My una voidable conc lu sion was that I had expe rienced the interrupt ion of som e mysteri ous flow that kept me goi ng, a flow that had never been inter rupt ed before, at least not in the manne r in which don Juan had done it. When I tried to describe to any of my friends what I had phys ically expe rienced, a strange perspiration began to cove r my entire body, the same perspiration that I had expe rienced when don Juan had given me that l ook; 1 had been, at that mom ent, not onl y incapable of voi cing a singl e word, but incapable of hav ing a singl e thought . For som e time after, I dw elled on the phys ical sensation of this interruption, for which I found no rationa l expl anation. I argue d for a while that don Juan must have hypnot ized me, but then my memory told me that he hadn' t given any hypnot ic com mands , nor had he made any move ments that coul d have trappe d my attention. In fact, he had merely glanced at me. It was the inten sity of that gl ance that had made it appe ar as if he had stared at me for a long time. It had obs essed me, and had rende red me discom bobul ated at a deep phys ical level. When 1 finally had don Juan in front of me again, the first thing I not iced about him was that he didn 't look at all as I had imagined him dur ing all the time I had tried to find him. I had fabricated an image of the man I had met at the bus depot , which 1 perfected every day by allegedly remembering more details. In my mind, he was an old man, still very strong and nimble, yet almost frail. The man facing me was muscular and decisive. He move d with agility, but not nimbleness. His steps were firm and, at the same time, light . He exude d vitality and pur pos e.

His hair was longe r, and not as white as I had imagined. His com plexion was not that dark either. I coul d have sworn that his features were birdlike, because of his ag e. But that was not so either. His face was full, almost round. In one glance, the most out standi ng feature of the man looki ng at me was his dark eyes, which shone with a peculiar, dancing glow . Som ething that had bypa ssed me com pletely in my prior assess ment of him was the fact that his total count enance was that of an athlete. His shoul ders were broad, his stom ach flat; he seemed to be planted firmly on the ground. There was no feebleness to his kne es, no tremor in his uppe r limbs. I had imagined detecti ng a slight tremor in his head and arms, as if he were nervous and uns teady. I had also imagined him to be about five feet six inches tall, three inches shor ter than his actual height . Don Juan didn' t seem surprised to see me. I wanted to tell him how diff icult it had been for me to find him. I woul d have liked to be congr atulated by him on my titanic efforts, but he just laughe d at me, teasingl y. \"Your efforts are not impor tant,\" he said. \"What's impor tant is that you found my place.

Not in terms of supe riority or inferiority, or anyt hing of the like, but in terms of the capacity to be respons ible. \"Only the nagua l,\" he said, \"has the energetic capacity to be respons ible for the fate of his cohor ts. Every one of his cohor ts know s this, and they accede. The nagua l can be a man or a wom an. In the time of the sorcerers who were the founde rs of my lineage, wom en were, by rule, the nagua ls. Their natural pragma tism - the prod uct of their femaleness - led my lineage into pits of practicalities from which they coul d barely emerge. Then, the males took ove r, and led my lineage into pits of imbecility from which we are barely emerging now . \"Since the time of the nagua l Lujan, who lived about two hundr ed"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 years ago, \" he went on, \"there has been a joint nexus of effort, shared by a man and a wom an.

Instead, he himself formu lated it for me. \"Is there a nagua l wom an in my life?\" he as ked. \"No, there isn't any. 1 am a solitary sorcerer. I have my cohor ts, though. At the mom ent, they are not around. \" A thought came with unc ont ainable vigor into my mind. At that instant, I remembered what som e peopl e in Yum a had told me about don Juan run ning with a party of Mexican men who seemed to be very versed in sorcery maneuve rs. \"To be a sorcerer,\" don Juan cont inue d, \"doe sn't mean to prac tice witchcraft, or to work to affect peopl e, or to be pos sessed by demons . To be a sorcerer means to reach a level of awareness that makes inconc eivable things available. The term 'sorcery' is inade qua te to expr ess what sorcerers do, and so is the term 'shaman ism.' The actions of sorcerers are exclusively in the realm of the abstract, the impersona l. Sorcerers struggl e to reach a goa l that has not hing to do with the que sts of an average man. Sorcerers' aspirations are to reach infinity, and to be cons cious of it.\" Don Juan cont inue d, saying that the task of sorcerers was to face infinity, and that they plunge d i nto it daily, as a fisherman plunge s into the sea. It was such an ove rwhelming task that sor cerers had to state their names before venturing into it. He reminde d me that, in Noga les, he had stated his name before any interaction had taken place between us .

You are the man I was looki ng for. My que st ende d when I found you, and your s when you found me now .\" Don Juan expl ained to me that, as the nagua l of his generation, he was in search of an indi vidua l who had a specific energetic conf igur ation, adequa te to ensure the cont inui ty of his lineage. He said that at a given mom ent, the nagua l of each generation for twenty - seven successive generations had entered into the most nerve - racking expe rience of their lives: the search for succession. Looki ng me straight in the eyes, he stated that what made hum an beings into sorcerers was their capacity to perceive energy directly as it flow s in the uni verse, and that when sorcerers per ceive a hum an being in this fashion, they see a lum inous ball, or a lum inous egg - shaped figur e. His cont ention was that hum an beings are not o nly capable of seeing energy directly as it flow s in the uni verse, but that they actually do see it, although they are not deliberately cons cious of seeing it. He made right then the most crucial distinction for sorcerers, the one between the general state of being aware and the particu lar state of being deliberately cons cious of som ething. He catego rized all hum an beings as pos sessing awareness, in a general sense, which permits them to see energy directly, and he categor ized sor cerers as the onl y hum an beings who were deliberately cons cious of seeing energy directly. He then defined \"awareness\" as energy and \"energy\" as constant flux, a lum inous vibration"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 that was never stationa ry, but always movi ng of its ow n accord. He asserted that when a hum an being was seen, he was perceived as a congl om erate of energy fields held toge ther by the most mysteri ous force in the uni verse: a bindi ng, aggl utinating, vibratory force that hol ds energy fields toge ther in a cohe sive uni t. He further expl ained that the nagua l was a specific sorcerer in each genera tion whom the other sorcerers were able to see, not as a singl e lum inous ball but as a set of two sphe res of lum inos ity fused, one ove r the other. \"This feature of doub leness,\" he cont inue d, \"permits the nagua l to perform maneuve rs that are rather difficult for an average sor cerer. For example, the nagua l is a connoi sseur of the force that hol ds us toge ther as a cohe sive uni t. The nagua l coul d place his full attention, for a fraction of a second, on that force, and num b the other person. I did that to you at the bus depot because I wanted to stop your barrage of me, me, me, me, me, me, me. I wanted you to find me and cut the crap. \"The sorcerers of my lineage maintained,\" don Juan went on, \"that the prese nce of a doubl e being - a nagua l - is sufficient to clarify things for us. What's odd about it is that the presence of the nagua l clarifies things in a veiled fashion. It happe ned to me when I met the nagua l Julian, my teacher. His presence baffled me for year s, because every time I was around him, I coul d think clearly, but when he move d away, I became the same idiot that I had always been. \"I had the privilege,\" don Juan went on, \"of actually meeting and dealing with two nagua ls. For six years, at the reque st of the nagua l Elias, the teacher of the nagua l Julian, I went to live with him. He is the one who reared me, so to speak. It was a rare privi lege.

There were more women in his life than one woul d care to think about . Yet bot h of them were astoundi ngly alike in that there was not hing inside them. They were empty. The nagua l Elias was a collection of astoundi ng, haunt ing stories of regions unknow n.

Whenever I tried to pin dow n the man in them, the real man, the way I coul d pinpoi nt the man in my father, the man in everybody I kne w, I round not hing. Instead of a real person inside them, there was a bunc h of stories about persons unknow n. Each of the two men had his ow n flair, but the end result was just the same: emptiness, an emptiness that reflected not the world, but infinity.\" Don Juan went on expl aining that the mom ent one cros ses a peculiar threshol d in infinity, either deliberately or, as in my case, unw ittingl y, everything that happe ns to one from then on is no longe r exclusively in one 's ow n dom ain, but enters into the realm of infinity. \"When we met in Arizona , bot h of us c rossed a peculiar thresh old,\" he cont inue d. \"And this threshol d was not decided by either one of us, but by infinity itself. Infinity is everything that surrounds us.\" He said this and made a broad gesture with his arms. \"The sorcerers of my lineage call it infinity, the spirit, the dar k sea of aw areness, and say that it is som ething that exists out there and rules our lives.\" I was truly capable of com prehendi ng everything he was saying, and yet 1 didn' t know what the hell he was talking about .

He called it intent. \"What put you and me toge ther,\" he went on, \"was the intent of infinity. It is impos sible to determine what this intent of infinity is, yet it is there, as palpable as you and 1 are. Sorcerers say that it is a t remor in the air. The adva ntage of sorcerers is to know that the tremor in the air exists, and to acqui esce to it without any further ado. For sorcerers, there's no ponde ring, wonde ring, or speculating. They kno w that all they have is the pos sibility of me rging with the intent of infinity, and they just do it.\" Nothing coul d have been clearer to me than thos e statements. As far as I was conc erned, the truth of what he was telling me was so self - evident that it didn' t permit me to ponde r how such absurd asse rtions coul d have sounde d so rationa l. 1 kne w that everything that don Juan was saying was not onl y a truism, but 1 coul d corrobo rate it by referring to my ow n being.

That crack, which sorcerers call the gap, is closed when a man is in his prime.\" He had said that, nor mally, all that is discernible to the sor cere r's eye is a tenuous discoloration in the otherwise whitish glow of the lum inous sphe re. But when a man is close to dyi ng, that gap becom es qui te appa rent. He had assured me that my friend' s gap was wide ope n. \"What is the signi ficance of all this, don Jua n?\" I had asked perfunc torily. \"The signi ficance is a deadly one ,\" he had replied. \"The spirit was signa ling to me that som ething was com ing to an end. I thought it was my life that was com ing to an end, and I accepted it as gracefully as I coul d. It dawne d on me much, much later that it wasn't my life that was com ing to an end, but my entire lineage.\""},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 I didn' t kn ow what he was talking about . But how coul d I have taken all that serious ly? As far as I was conc erned, it was, at the time he said it, like everything else in my life: just talk. \"Your friend himself told you, thoug h not in so many words, that he was dyi ng, \" don Juan said. \"You acknow ledge d what he was saying the way you acknow ledge d what I said, but in bot h cases, you chos e to bypa ss it.\" I had no com ments to make. I was ove rwhelmed by what he was saying. I wanted to sink into the crate I was s itting on, to dis appe ar, swallow ed up by the earth. \"It's not your fault that you bypa ss things like this,\" he went on. \"It's yout h. You have so many things to do, so many peopl e around you. You are not alert. You never learned to be alert, any way.\" In t he vein of defendi ng the last bastion of myself, my idea that I was watchful, I poi nted out to don Juan that I had been in life - and - death situations that requi red my qui ck wit and vigilance. It wasn't that I lacked the capacity to be alert, but that I lack ed the orientation for setting an appr opr iate list of priorities; therefore, everything was either impo rtant or uni mpo rtant to me. \"To be alert doe sn't mean to be watchful,\" don Juan said. \"For sorcerers, to be alert means to be aware of the fabric of the everyda y world that seems extraneous to the interaction of the mom ent. On the trip that you took with your friend before you met me, you not iced onl y the details that were obvi ous . You didn' t not ice how his death was absorbing him, and yet som ething in you kne w it.\" I began to protest, to tell him that what he was saying wasn't true. \"Don' t hide your self behind banalities,\" he said in an accusing tone . \"Stand up.

You woul d have not iced that he was closing his account s, se eing the peopl e who helped him, saying good - bye to them. \"Your anthrop ologi st friend talked to me once,\" don Juan went on. \"I remembered him so clearly that I wasn't surprised at all when he brought you to me at that bus depot . I coul dn' t help him when he talked to me. He wasn't the man I was looki ng for, but I wished him well from my sorcerer's emptiness, from my sorcerer's silence. For this reason, I know that on his last trip, he was saying thank you to the peopl e who count ed in his life.\" I adm itted to don Juan that he was so very right , that there had been so many details that I had been aware of, but that they hadn' t meant a thing to me at the time, such as, for instance, my friend' s ecstasy in watching the scenery around us. He woul d stop the car just to watch, for hour s on end, the mount ains in the distance, or the riverbed, or the desert. I discarded this as the idiotic senti mentality of a middl e - aged man. I even made vague hints to him that perhaps he was drinki ng too much. He told me that in dire cases a drink woul d allow a man a mom ent of peace and detach ment, a mom ent long enough to savor som ething un repeatable. \"That was, for a fact, the trip for his eyes only,\" don Juan said. \"Sorcerers take such a trip and, in it, not hing count s except what t heir eyes can absorb.

The end result of ou r indi vidual behaviors is that I measure everything I do and say, and you don' t.\" I conc eded that he was right , but I assured him that whatever he was saying did not alleviate my turmoil, or my sadne ss. I blurt ed out then, unc ont rollably, every nua nce of my conf used feelings . I told him that I wasn't in search of advi ce. I wanted him to prescribe a sorcerer's way to end my angui sh. I believed I was really interested in getting from him som e natural relaxant, an organic Valium, and I said so to him. Don Juan shook his head in bewilderment. \"You are too much,\" he said. \"Next you' re goi ng to ask for a sor cerer's medication to remove everything annoyi ng from you, with no effort at all on your part - just the effort of swallow ing what ever is given. The more awful the taste, the better the results. That's your Western man's motto. You want results - one pot ion and you' re cured. \"Sorcerers face things in a different way,\" don Juan cont inue d. \"Since they don' t have any time to spare, they give themselves fully to what's in front of them.

Don Juan pus hed his b arb even deeper. \"Your friend kne w that he was dyi ng, \" he said. \"He wrote you one final letter to find out about your doi ngs. Perhaps unbe know nst to him, or to you, you were his last thought .\" The weight of don Juan's words was too much for my shoul ders. I collapsed. I felt that I had to lie dow n. My head was spinni ng. Maybe it was the setting. I had made the terrible mistake of arriv ing at don Juan's hous e in the late afternoon. The setting sun seemed astoundi ngl y gol den, and the reflections on the bare mount ains to the east of don Juan's hous e were gol d and pur ple. The sky didn' t have a speck of a cloud. Nothing seemed to move . It was as if the whol e world were hiding, but its presence was ove r pow ering. The qui etness of the Sonor an desert was like a dag ger. It went to the marrow of my bone s. I wanted to leave, to get in my car and drive away. I wanted to be in the city, get lost in its noi se. \"You are having a taste of infinity,\" don Juan said with grave finality. \"I know it, because I have been in your shoe s.

I discarded the thought immediately. That coul dn 't be pos sible. \"Sadne ss, for sorcerers, is not persona l,\" don Juan said, again erupt ing into my though ts. \"It is not qui te sadne ss. It's a wave of energy that com es from the depths of the cosmos, and hits sorcer ers when they are receptive, when they are like radios, capable of catching radio waves. \"The sorcerers of olden times, who gave us the entire format of sorcery, believed that there is sadne ss in the uni verse, as a force, a condi tion, like light , l ike intent, and that this perenni al force acts especially on sorcerers because they no longe r have any defensive shields. They cannot hide behind their friends or their studi es. They cannot hide behind love , or hatred, or happi ness, or misery. They can't h ide behind anyt hing. \"The condi tion of sorcerers,\" don Juan went on, \"is that sad ness, for them, is abstract.

He stressed that inne r silence meant the suspension of the internal dialogue - the perenni al com p anion of thought s - and was therefore a state of profound qui etude . \"The old sorcerers,\" don Juan said, \"called it inne r silence because it is a state in which perception doe sn't depend on the senses. What is at work dur ing inne r silence is anot her faculty that man has, the faculty that makes him a magical being, the very faculty that has been curtailed, not by man himself but by som e extraneous influence.\" \"What is this extraneous influence that curtails the magical faculty of man?\" I asked. \"That is the t opi c for a future expl anation, \" don Juan replied, \"not the subj ect of our present discussion, even though it is inde ed the most serious aspect of the sorcery of the shamans of ancient Mexico. \"Inne r silence,\" he cont inue d, \"is the stand from which everythi ng stems in sorcery.

He expl ained that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico discove red th at each indi vidua l had a different threshol d of inne r silence in terms of time, meaning that inne r silence must be kept by each one of us for the lengt h of time of our specific threshol d before it can work. \"What did thos e sorcerers cons ider the sign that inne r silence is working, don Juan?\" I asked. \"Inne r silence works from the moment you begin to accrue it,\" he replied. \"What the old sorcerers were after was the final, dra matic, end result of reaching that indi vidua l thresho ld of silence. Som e very tale nted practitioners need onl y a few min utes of silence to reach that cove ted goa l. Others, less talented, need long periods of silence, perhaps more than one hour of com plete qui etude , before they reach the desired result. The desired result is what the ol d sorcerers called stoppi ng the world, the mom ent when everything around us ceases to be what it's always been. \"This is the mom ent when sorcerers return to the true nature of man,\" don Juan went on. \"The old sorcerers also called it total freedom .

It's onl y when the mortar hard ens that the loos e bricks becom e a structure.\" From the beginning of ou r association, don Juan had drilled into me the value, the necessity, of inne r silence. I did my best to follow his sugge stions by accum ulating inne r silence second by sec ond. I had no means to measure the effect of this accum ulation, nor did I have any means to judge whether or not I had reached any threshol d. I simply aimed dogge dly at accruing it, not just to please don Juan but because the act of accum ulating it had becom e a challenge in itself. One day, don Juan and I were taking a leisurely stroll in the main plaza of Hermosillo. It was the early afternoon of a cloudy day. The heat was dry, and actually very pleasant. There were lots of peopl e walking around. There were stores around the plaza. I had been to Hermosillo many times, and yet 1 had never not iced the stores. I kne w that they were there, but their presence was not som ething 1 had been cons cious ly aware of. I coul dn' t have made a map of that plaza if my life depende d on it. That day, as I walked with don Juan, I was trying to locate and identify the stores. I searched for som ething to use as a mnemoni c device that woul d stir my recollection for later use. \"As I have told you before, many times,\" don Juan said, jolting me out of my conc en tration, \"every sorcerer I kno w, male or female, soone r or later arrives at a breaking poi nt in their lives.\""},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 \"Do you mean that they have a mental breakdow n or som e thing like that?\" I asked \"No, no, \" he said, laughi ng. \"Mental breakdow ns are for per sons who indul ge in themselves.

Don Jua n Matus as a teacher ende avor ed, from the very instant we met, to introduc e me to the cogni tive world of the shamans of ancient Mexico. The term \"cogni tion\" was, for me at that time, a bone of tremendous cont ention. I unde rstood it as the process by which we recogni ze the world around us. Certain things fall within the realm of that process and are easily recogni zed by us. Other things don' t, and remain, therefore, as oddi ties, things for which we nave no adequa te com prehension. Don Juan maintained, from th e start of ou r association, that the world of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico was different from our s, not in a shallow way, but different in the way in which the Process of cogni tion was arrange d. He maintained that in our world our cogni tion requi res the interpretation of sensory data. He said that the uni verse is com pos ed of an infinite num ber of energy fields that exist in the uni verse at large as lum inous fila ments. Thos e lum inous filaments act on man as an organism. The respons e of the organism is to turn tho se energy fields into sen sory data. Sensory data is then interpreted, and that interpreta tion becom es our cogni tive system. My unde rstandi ng of cogni tion forced me to believe that it is a uni versal process, as langua ge is a uni versal process. Th ere is a different synt ax for every langua ge, as there must be a slight ly different arrange ment for every system of interpretation in the world.

What 1 desperately wanted him to say was that their different cogni tive system was the equi valent of having a different langua ge but that it was a l angua ge none the less. \"The end of an era\" meant, to don Juan, that the uni ts of a foreign cogni tion were beginni ng to take hol d. The uni ts of my nor mal cogni tion, no matter how pleasant and rewarding they were for me, were beginni ng to fade. A grave mom ent in the life of a man! Perhaps my most cherished uni t was my academic life. Anyt hing that threatened it was a threat to the very core of my being, especially if the attack was veiled, unnot iced. It happe ned with a professor in whom I had put all my trust, Professor Lorca. I had enrolled in Professor Lorca's cour se on cogni tion because he was recom mende d to me as one of the most brilliant aca demics in existence. Professor Lorca was rather hands om e, with blond hair neatly com bed to the side. His forehead was smoot h, wrinkl e - free, giving the appe arance of som eone who had never worried in his life. His clothes were extremely well tailored. He didn' t wear a tie, a feature that gave him a boyi sh look. He woul d put on a tie onl y to face impor tant peopl e. On my mem orable first class with Professor Lorca, I was bewildered and nervous at seeing how he paced back and forth for min utes that stretched themselves into an eternity for me. Professor Lorca kept on mov ing his thin, clenched lips up and dow n, addi ng immensiti es to the tension he was generating in that closed - win dow , stuffy room . Sudde nly, he stoppe d walking.

He went on to read to the class an article in the newspaper in which the work of a biologi st was repor ted. The scientist was quot ed as describing w hat frogs felt when insects swam above their heads. \"This article show s the carelessness of the repor ter, who has obvi ous ly misquot ed the scientist,\" Professor Lorca asserted with the author ity of a full professor. \"A scientist, no matter how shoddy his wo rk might be, woul d never allow himself to anthro pom orph ize the results of his research, unl ess, of cour se, he's a nincom poop. \" With this as an introduc tion, he delivered a most brilliant lec ture on the insular qua lity of ou r cogni tive system, or the cogn itive system of any organism, for that matter. He brought to me, in his initial lecture, a barrage of new ideas and made them extremely simple, ready for use. The most nove l idea to me was that every indi vidua l of every species on this earth interprets the world around it, using data repor ted by its specialized senses. He asserted that hum an beings cannot even imagine what it must be like, for example, to be in a world ruled by echol ocation, as in the world of bats, where any inferred po int of reference cou ld not even be conc eived of by the hum an mind. He made it qui te clear that, from that poi nt of view, no two cogni tive systems coul d be alike among species.

He has a plot to be bur ied in, and a hefty life insurance pol icy that will take care of his fam ily. Having fulfilled thos e two manda tes, he doe sn't think about death anym ore. He thinks onl y about his work. \"Professor Lorca makes sense when he talks,\" don Juan cont in ued, \"because he is prepared to use words accurately.

The machines can in no way help anyone face the una voi dable appoi ntment: the appoi ntment with infinity. \"The nagua l Julian used to tell me,\" he went on, \"about the conque ring generals of ancient R om e.

In exchange for roo m and boa rd, I took ca re of vacuum ing the pool , raking the leaves, put ting the trash out , and making breakfast for Patricia and myself. I was also the handym an in the hous e as well as the family chauffeur; I drove Mrs. Turner to do her shoppi ng and I boug ht liquor for Mr. Turne r, which I"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 had to sneak into the hous e and then into his studi o. He was an insurance executive who was a solitary drinke r. He had prom ised his family that he was not goi ng to touc h the bot tle ever again after som e serious family altercations due to his exc essive drinki ng. He conf essed to me that he had tapered off enor mous ly, but that he needed a swig from time to time. His studi o was, of cour se, off limits to everybod y except me. I was suppos ed to go in to clean it, but what I really did was hide his bot t les inside a beam that appe ared to suppor t an arch in the ceiling in the studi o but that was actually hol low . I had to sneak the bot tles in and sneak the empties out and dum p them at the market. Patricia was a drama and music major in college and a fabul ou s singe r. Her goa l was to sing in musicals on Broadw ay. It goe s without saying that I fell head ove r heels in love with Patricia Turner. She was very slim and athletic, a brune tte with angul ar features and about a head taller than I am, my ultimate requi si te for goi ng bananas ove r any wom an. I seemed to fulfill a deep need in her, the need to nur ture som e one , especially after she realized that her daddy trusted me implicitly. She became my little mom my. I coul dn' t even open my mout h witho ut her cons ent. Sh e watched me like a hawk. She even wrote term papers for me, read textbooks and gave me synops es of them. And 1 liked it, but not because I wanted to be nur tured; I don' t think that that need was ever part of my cogni tion. I relished the fact that she did it. I relished her com pany. She used to take me to the movi es daily. She had passes to all the big movi e theaters in Los Ange les, given to her father cour tesy of som e movi e mogul s. Mr. Turner never used them himself; he felt that it was beneath his digni ty to flash mov ie passes. The movi e clerks always made the recipients of such passes sign a receipt.

One of them, a sassy young guy, made a remark that cracked him up, and me, too, but which sent Patricia into a fit of fury. \"I think you' re Mr. Turd,\" he said with the nastiest smil e you coul d imagine, \"not Mr. Turner.\" I coul d have sloughe d off the remark, but then he subj ected us to the profound hum iliation of refusing us entrance to see Hercules starring Steve Reeves. Usually, we went everyw here with Patricia's best friend, Sandr a Flanagan, who lived next door with her parents. Sandr a was qui te the oppos ite of Patricia. She was just as tall, but her face was round, with rosy cheeks and a sensuous mout h; she was healthier than a raccoon. She had no interest in singi ng. She was onl y interested in the sensual pleasures of the body. She coul d eat and drink anyt hing and digest it, and - the feature that finished me off abou t her - after she had pol ished off her ow n plate, she man - aged to do the same with mine, a thing that, being a picky eat er, I had never been able to do in all my life. She was also extremely athletic, but in a rough, whol esom e way. She coul d punc h like a man and kick like a mule. As a cour tesy to Patricia, I used to do the same chor es for Sandr a's parents that I did for her s: vacuum ing their pool , raking the leaves from their lawn, taking the trash out on trash day, and incinerating papers and flammable trash. That was the time in Los Ange les when the air pol lution was increased by the use of backya rd incinerators.

He had two girlfriends , and he lived with bot h of them, appa rently in a state of bliss. He began by giving me, he said, the simplest advi ce: how to behave in a movi e theater if you had two girlfriends . He said that whenever he went to a movi e with his two girlfriends , all his attention was always centere d on whoe ver sat to his left. After a while, the two girls woul d go to the bathroom and, on their return, he woul d have them change the seating arrange ment. Anna woul d sit where Betty had been sitting, and nobody around them was the wiser. He assured me th at this was the first step in a long process of breaking the girls into a matter - of - fact acceptance of the trio situation; Nichol as was rather corny, and he used that trite French exp ression: menage a trois. I follow ed his advi ce and went to a theater that show ed silent movi es on Fairfax Avenue in Los Ange les with Patricia and Sandy. I sat Patricia to my left and pour ed all my attention on her. They went to the bathroo m, and when they returned I told them to switch places. I started then to do what Nichol as van Hoot en had advi sed, but Patricia woul d not put up with any non sense like that. She stood up and left the theater, offende d, hum iliated, and raving mad.

The out com e of our three - sided relations hip was that, in the end, we nearly destroye d our selves. We were not prepared for such an ende avor . We didn' t know how to resolve the probl ems of affection, morality, dut y, and social m ores. I coul dn' t leave one of them for the other, and they coul dn' t leave me. One day, at the climax of a tremendous uphe aval, and out of sheer desperation, all three of us fled in different directions , never to see one anot her again. I felt devastated. No thing of what I did coul d erase their impact on my life. I left Los Ange les and got bus y with endl ess things in an effort to placate my longi ng. Without exagge rating in the least, I can sincerely say that I fell into the depths of hell, I believed, never t o emerge again. If it hadn' t been for the influ ence that don Juan had on my life and my person, I woul d never have survived my private demons . I told don Juan that I kne w that whatever I had done was wrong, that I had no bus iness enga ging such wonde rful p eopl e in such sordid, stupi d shenani gans that I had no preparation to face. \"What was wrong, \" don Juan said, \"was that the three of you were lost egom aniacs.

Embrace them totally for the last time. Bu t intend that this is the last time on Earth. Intend it from your dark ness.

Acts of this nature make warriors airbor ne, almost vapor ous .\" Foll ow ing don Juan's com mands , I took the task to heart. I realized that if I didn 't emerge victorious , don Juan was not the onl y one who was goi ng to lose out . I woul d also lose som ething, and whatever I was goi ng to lose was as impor tant to me as what don Ju an had described as being impor tant to him. I was goi ng to lose my chance to face infinity and be cons cious of it. The memory of Patricia Turner and Sandr a Flanagan put me in a terrible frame of mind. The devastating sense of irreparable loss that had chas ed me all these years was as vivid as ever. When don Juan exacerbated that feeling, I kne w for a fact that there are certain things that can remain with us, in don Juan's terms, for life and perhaps beyond. I had to find Patricia Turner and Sand ra Flanagan . Don Juan's final recom menda tion was that if I did find them, I coul d not stay with them.

Her plane arrived in the early evening, and she as ked me if I coul d take her to the campus so she coul d take a look at the place where she was goi ng to spend the next four years of her life. I kne w where the campus was, for I had driven past its entrance on Suns et Boul evard endl ess times on my way to the beach. I had never been on the campus , though. It was dur ing the semester break. The few peopl e that we found directed us to the music department. The campus was deserted, but what I witnessed subj ectively was the most exqui site thing I have ever seen. It was a delight to my eyes. The bui ldings seemed to be alive with som e energy of their ow n. What was goi ng to be a very cursory visit to the music department turned out to be a gigantic tour of the entire campus . I fell in love with UCLA. I mentione d to don Juan that the onl y thing that marred my ecstasy was my girlfriend' s annoya nce at my insistence on walking through the huge campus . \"What the hell coul d there be in here?\" she yelled at me in protest. \"It's as if you have never seen a uni versity campus in y our life! You 've seen one , you' ve seen them all. I think you' re just try ing to impress my friend with your sensitivity!\" I wasn't, and I vehemently told them that I was genui nely impressed by the beauty of my surround ings . I sensed so much hope in thos e b uildings , so much prom ise, and yet I coul dn' t expr ess my subj ective state. \"I have been in school nearly all my life,\" my girlfriend said through clenched teeth, \"and I'm sick and tired of it!

I made a prom ise then that I woul d go to school at UCLA, no mat ter what, com e hell or high water. My desire had everything to do with me, and yet it was not driven by the need for immediate gratification. It was more in the realm of awe. I told don Juan that my girlfriend 's annoya nce had been so jar ring to me th at it forced me to look at her in a different light , and that to my recollection, that was the first time ever that a com mentary had arous ed such a deep reaction in me. I saw facets of character in my girlfriend that I hadn 't seen before, facets that scar ed me stiff. \"I think I judge d her terribly,\" I said to don Juan. \"After our visit to the campus , we drifted apart. It was as if UCLA had com e between us like a wedge . I know that it's stupi d to think this way.\" \"It isn't stupi d,\" don Juan said. \"It was a perfectly valid reac tion.

He began b y saying that he was goi ng to present an arrange ment of conc epts that I shoul d not take as sorcerers' theories unde r any condi tions , because it was an arrange ment formulated by the shamans of ancient Mexico as a result of seeing energy directly as it flow s in the uni verse.

He stated that thos e sorcerers also found out that every crea ture in the uni verse is attached to the dar k sea of aw areness at a round poi nt of lum inos ity that was appa rent when thos e creatures were perceived as energy. On that poi nt of lu minos ity, which the sorcerers of ancient Mexico called the assemblage poi nt, don Juan said that perception was assembled by a mysterious aspect of the dar k sea of aw areness. Don Juan asserted that on the assemblage poi nt of hum an beings , zillions of energy fields from the uni verse at large, in the form of lum inous filaments, conve rge and go throu gh it. These energy fields are conve rted into sensory data, and the sensory data is then interpreted and perceived as the world we know . Don Juan further expl ained that what turns the lum inous fibers into sensory data is the dar k sea of awareness.

He warned me then that he was goi ng to m ake a statement which, in the unde rstandi ng of sorcerers, was central to com prehendi ng the scope of the recapi tu lation. Putting an enor mous empha sis on his words, he said that what we call the senses in organisms is not hing but degrees of aware ness.

Sorcerers had found out a gigantic truth about the forces of the uni verse: The dar k sea of aw areness wants onl y our life expe ri ences, not our life force.\" The premises of don Juan's elucidation were incom pre hensible to me. Or perhaps it woul d be more accurate to say that I was vague ly and yet deeply cogni zant of how func tiona l the premises of his expl anation were. \"Sorcerers believe,\" don Juan went on, \"that as we recapi tulate our lives, all the debris, as I told you, com es to the surface.

My memory faculty had been for me, prior to that event, a vague way of referring to things that h ad happe ned, but which I wanted most of the time to forget. Basically, I had no interest whatsoever in remembering anyt hing of my life.

Every time I recapi tulated in such a fashion, I had a degree of detachm ent which allow ed me to see things I had disr egarded when I had really been in the throes of them. The first time in which the recollection of an event shook me to my founda tions happe ned after I had given a lecture at a col lege in Oregon. The stude nts in charge of organizing the lecture took me and anot her anthropo logy friend of mine to a hous e to spend the night . I was goi ng to go to a motel, but they insisted, for our com fort, on taking us to this hous e. They said that it was in the count ry, and there were no noi ses, the qui etest place in the worl d, with no telephone s, no interference from the out side world. I, like the fool that I was, agreed to go with them. Don Juan had not onl y warned me to always be a solitary bird, he had demande d that I obs erve his recom menda tion, som ething that I did most o f the time, but there were occasions when the gregari ous creature in me took the uppe r hand. The com mittee took us to the hous e, qui te a distance from Portland, of a professor who was on sabba tical. Very swiftly, they turned on the light s inside and out side of the hous e, which was located on a hill with spot light s all around it. With the spot light s on, the hous e must have been visible from five miles away.

There was no way to go to the bath room without seeing your self from every conc eivable angl e. I enjoye d all thos e features of the hous e, which seemed to me stu pendous . When the time came for me to go to sleep , how ever, I encoun tered a serious probl em because there was onl y one narrow , hard, qui te mona stic bed and my anthropol ogist friend was close to having pne um oni a, wheezing and retching phl egm every time he coughe d. He went straight for the bed and passed out . I looke d for a place to sleep. I coul dn' t find one . That hous e was barren of com forts. Besides, it was cold. The com mittee had turned on the light s, but not the heater. I looke d for the heater. My search was fruitless, as was my search for the switch to the spot light s or to any of the light s in the hous e, for that matter. The switches were there on the walls, but they seemed to be ove rruled by the effect of som e main switch. The light s were on, and I had no way to turn them off.

I had recollected the event that don Juan had called the usher with equa l clarity, but my tende ncy had always bee n to half - disregard what happe ned to me when I was with don Juan, on the basis that in his presence anyt hing was pos sible. This time, how ever, I was alone . Years before I met don Juan, I had worked painting signs on bui ldings . My bos s's name was Luigi Palm a. One day Luigi got a cont ract to paint a sign, adve rtising the sale and rental of bridal gow ns and tuxe dos , on the back wall of an old bui lding. The ow ner of the store in the bui lding wanted to catch the eye of pos sible custom ers with a large display. L uigi was goi ng to paint a bride and groom , and I was goi ng to do the lettering.

Luigi tho ught that I was beginni ng to be afraid of height s, but that my fear was goi ng to pass. When the time came to start working, he low ered the scaffold a few feet from the roof and jum ped ont o its flat boa rds. He went to one side, while I stood on the other in order to be totally ou t of his way. He was the artist. Luigi began to show off. His painting move ments were so erratic and agitated that the scaffold move d back and forth. I became dizzy.

Instead of helping me unt angl e my feet, Luigi sat dow n and braced himself with the cords that attached the scaf fold to the flat roof . He crossed himself and looke d at me in hor ror. From his sitting pos ition, he kne lt, weeping qui etly as he recited the Lord's Prayer. I held on to the edge of the wall for dear life; what gave me the desperate strengt h to endur e was the certainty that if I was in cont rol, I coul d kee p the scaffold from movi ng farther and farther away. I wasn't goi ng to lose my grip and fall thirteen floor s to my death. Luigi, being a com pul sive taskm aster to the bitter end, yelled to me, in the midst of tears, that I shoul d pray. He swore that bot h of us were goi ng to fall to our deaths, and that the least we coul d do was to pray for the salvation of our soul s. For a mom ent, I deliberated about whether it was func tiona l to pray. I opt ed to yell for help. Peopl e in the bui lding must have heard my yellin g and sent for the firemen.

Its force was so intense that I had to excuse myself and retreat for a mom ent to a corner. M y friends seemed to unde rstand my reaction ; they dis bande d without any com ments. What I was remembering was an incident that had taken place in my last year of high school . My best friend and I used to walk to school , passing a big mansion with a black wr ought - iron fence at least seven feet high and endi ng in poi nted spikes. Behind the fence was an extensive, well - kept green lawn, and a huge , ferocious German shephe rd dog. Every day, we used to tease the dog and let him charge at us. He stoppe d phys ically at the wrought - iron fence, but his rage seemed to cross ove r to us. My friend delight ed in enga ging the dog every day in a cont est of mind ove r matter. He used to stand a few inches from the dog' s snout , which protruded between the iron bars at least six inches into the street, and bare his teeth, just like the dog did. \"Yield, yield!\" my friend shout ed every time. \"Obey! Obey! I am more pow erful than you! \" His daily displays of mental pow er, which lasted at least five minut es, never affected the dog, out side of leaving him more furi ous than ever.

We waited for a mom ent, but he didn' t show up; then we saw him, at the end of the extensive lawn. He seemed to be bus y there, so we slow ly began to walk away. From the com er of my eye, I not iced that the dog was runni ng at full speed, tow ard us. When he was per haps six or seven feet from the fence, he took a gigantic le ap ove r it. I was sure that he was goi ng to rip his belly on the spikes. He barely cleared them and fell ont o the street like a sack of pot atoes. I thought for a mom ent that he was dead, but he was onl y stunne d. Sudde nly, he got up, and instead of chasing after the one who had brought about his rage, he ran after me. I jum ped ont o the roof of a car, but the car was not hing for the dog. He took a leap and was nearly on top of me. I scrambled dow n and climbed the first tree that was within reach, a flimsy lit tle tree that coul d barely suppo rt my weight. I was sure that it woul d snap in the middl e, sendi ng me right into the dog 's jaws to be mauled to death. In the tree, I was nearly out of his reach. But the dog jum ped again, and snappe d his teeth, catching me by the seat of my pants and rippi ng them. His teeth actually nicked my but tocks. The mom ent I was safe at the top of the tree, the dog left. He just ran up the street, perhaps looki ng for my friend. At the infirmary in school , the nur se told me that I had to ask the ow ner of the dog for a certificate of rabies vaccination. \"You must look into this,\" she said severely. \"You may have rabies already.

In this hous e, we have enough clout to do that!\" I believed him, so I lied to the nur se and said that the dog coul d not be found, and that it had no ow ner. \"Oh my god! \" the wom an exclaimed. \"Then brace your self for the worst. I may have to send you to the doc tor.\" She gave me a long list of sym ptom s that I shoul d look for or wait for unt il they manifested themselves. She said that the injections for rabies we re extremely painful, and that they had to be adm inistered subc utaneous ly on the area of the abdom en. \"I woul dn' t wish that treatment on my worst enemy,\" she said, plungi ng me into a hor rid nigh tmare.

I ende d up goi ng to the school infirmary and beggi ng the wom an to give me the treatment for rabies, no matter how painful. I made a huge scene. I became hys terical.

My feeling is that it is now collapsing totally.\" After anot her long silenc e, don Juan expl ained that the sorcer ers of ancient Mexico believed that, as he had told me already, we had two minds , and onl y one of them was truly our s. I had always unde rstood don Juan as saying that there were two parts to our minds, and one of the m was always silent because expr ession was denied to it by the force of the other part. Whatever don Juan had said, I had taken as a metaphor ical way to expl ain, perhaps, the appa rent dom inance of the left hemisphe re of the brain ove r the right , or som ethi ng of the like. \"There is a secret opt ion to the recapi tulation\" , don Juan said. \"Just like I told you that there is a secret opt ion to dyi ng, an opt ion that onl y sorcerers take. In the case of dyi ng, the secret opt ion is that hum an beings coul d retain their life force and relinqui sh onl y their awareness, the produc t of their lives.

It is disintegrating what the sorcerers call the foreign installa tion, which exists in you and in every other hum an being. The effect of the force that is descendi ng on you, whi ch is disintegrat ing the foreign installation, is that it pul ls sorcerers out of their syn tax.\" I had listened carefully to don Juan, but I coul dn' t say that I had unde rstood what he had said. For som e strange reason, which was to me as unknow n as the ca use of my vivid recollections , I coul dn' t ask him any que stions . \"I know how difficult it is for you, \" don Juan said all of a sud den, \"to deal with this facet of your life. Every sorcerer that I know has gone through it. The males goi ng through it suffer infi nitely more damage than the females. I suppos e it's the condi tion of wom en to be more dur able. The sorcerers of ancient Mexico, acting as a group, tried their best to but tress the impact of this disintegrating force. In our day, we have no means of ac ting as a group, so we must brace our selves to face in solitude a force that will sweep us away from langua ge, for there is no way to describe adequa tely what is goi ng on. \" Don Juan was right in that I was at a loss for expl anations or ways of describing t he effect that thos e recollection s had had on me. Don Juan had told me that sorcerers face the unknow n in the most com mon incidents one can imagine.

Don Juan had called that sour ce infinity, or the voice of the spirit, and had said"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 178 that if sorcerers don' t try to be rationa l abou t what can't be rationa lized, the spirit une rring ly tells them what's what.

Cons eque ntly, he had prepared me to be ready to listen to that voi ce and act efficiently always, but withou t antecedents, using as little as pos sible the railings of the a priori. I waited impatiently for the voice of the spirit to tell me the meaning of my recollections , but not h ing happe ned. I was in a books tore one day when a girl recogni zed me and came ove r to talk to me. She was tall and slim, and had an inse cure, little girl's voi ce.

The memory of my grandpa rents' hous e floode d me. It was a veritable avalanche so intense that it was devastating, and onc e more, I had to retreat to a corner. My body shook, as if I had take n a chill. I must have been eight years old. My grandfather was talking to me. He had begun by telling me that it was his utmost dut y to set me straight . I had two cous ins who were my age: Alfredo and Luis. My grandf ather demande d mercilessly that I adm it that my cou sin Alfredo was really beautiful.

An act free from encroaching expe ctations, fears of failure, hope s of success.

One night , I was sitting at my desk preparing myself for my daily activity of writing. 1 felt a mom ent of grog giness. 1 thought that 1 was feeling dizzy because 1 had got te n up too qui ckly from my mat where 1 had been doi ng my exercises.

The thought crossed my mind that 1 had fainted. How ever, I coul d feel the chair, my desk; I coul d feel everything around me from inside the darkness that surrounde d me. Don Juan had said that the sorcerers of his lineage cons idered that one of the most cove ted results of inne r silence was a specific interplay of energy, whi ch is always heralded by a strong emotion. He felt that my recollections were the means to agitate me to the extreme, where I woul d expe rience this interplay. Such an inter play manifested itself in terms of hue s that were projected on any hor izon in the w orld of everyda y life, be it a mount ain, the sky, a wall, or simply the palms of the hands . He had expl ained that this interplay of hue s begins with the appe arance of a tenuous brush stroke of lavende r on the hor izon. In time, this lavende r brush stroke st arts to expa nd unt il it cove rs the visible hor izon, like adva ncing storm clouds .

That night at my desk, I didn' t see any lavende r brushstroke s, nor did I see any adva ncing clouds . I was sure that I didn' t have the discipline that sorcerers requi re for such an interplay of energy, but I had an enor mous dot of pom egranate red in front of me. This enor mous dot , without any preliminaries, expl ode d into disassociated words that I read as if they were on a sheet of paper com ing out of a type writer. The words move d at such tremendous speed in front of me that it was impos sible to read anyt hing. The n I heard a voi ce describing som ething to me. Again, the speed of the voi ce was wrong for my ears. The words were garbled, making it impos sible to hear anyt hing that woul d make sense.

I sensed that I needed his help more than ever. \"There's not hing gentle about sorcerers or sorcery,\" don Juan com mented after he heard my s tory. \"This was the first time that infinity descende d on you in such a fashion.

The Mexican gove rnm ent had had probl ems with ende mic wars with the Yaqui Indi ans for years.

I had the feeling that don Juan was setting me up for som ething, because he kne w that thos e stories were my cup of tea, so to speak. I had at that time an exagge rated sense of social justice and fair play. \"Circum stances around you have made it pos sible for you to have more energy, \" he went on. \"You have started the recapi tula tion of you r life; you have looke d at your friends for the first time as if they were in a display window ; you arrived at your breaking poi nt, all by your self, driven by your ow n needs; you canceled your bus iness; and above all, you have accrued enough inne r silence.

Maybe som eday you coul d change it your self, although, as with everything else in sorcer y, I am afraid that by the time you coul d actually do it, you won' t give a damn about it because it won' t make any difference what it is called anym ore.\" Don Juan had expl ained at great lengt h, dur ing the entire time that I had know n him, that dream ing was an art, discove red by the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, by means of which ordinary dreams were transformed into bona - fide entrances to other worlds of perception. He advoc ated, in any way he coul d, the adve nt of som e thing he called dream ing attention, whi ch was the capacity to pay a special kind of attention, or to place a special kind of awareness on the elements of an ordinary dream. I had follow ed meticulous ly all his recom menda tions and had succeeded in com mandi ng my awareness to remain fixed on the el ements of a dream. The idea that don Juan propos ed was not to set out deliberately to have a desired dream, but to fix one 's attention on the com pone nt elements of whatever dream presented itself. Then don Juan had show ed me energetically what the sorcerer s of ancient Mexico cons idered to be the origin of dream ing: the displacement of"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 189 the assemblage poi nt. He said that the assemblage poi nt was displaced very naturally du ring sleep, but that to see the displacement was a bit difficult because it requi red an aggr essive mood, and that such an aggr essive mood had been the predilec tion of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico. Thos e sorcerers, accord ing to don Juan, had found all the premises of their sorcery by means of this mood. \"It is a very predatory mood, \" don Juan went on. \"It's not diffi cult at all to enter into it, because man is a predator by nature. You coul d see, aggr essively, anybody in this little village, or per haps som eone far away, while they are asleep; anyone woul d do for the pur pos e at hand. What 's impor tant is that you arrive at a com plete sense of indi fference. You are in search of som ething, and you are out to get it. You' re goi ng to go out looki ng for a per son, searching like a feline, like an animal of prey, for som eone to descend on. \" Don J uan had told me, laughi ng at my appa rent chagrin, that the difficulty with this techni que was the mood, and that I coul dn' t be passive in the act of seeing, for the sight was not som ething to watch but to act upon. It might have been the pow er of his sug gestion, but that day, when he had told me all this, I felt astoundi ngl y aggr essive. Every muscle of my bod y was filled to the brim with energy, and in my dream ing practice I did go after som eone . I was not interested in who that som eone might have been. I needed som eone who was asleep, and som e force I was aware of, without being fully cons cious of it, had gui ded me to find that som eone . I never kne w who the person was, but while I was seeing that person, I felt don Juan's presence. It was a strange sensat ion of know ing that som eone was with me by an unde termined sensa tion of proxi mity that was happe ning at a level of awareness that"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 190 wasn't part of anyt hing that 1 had ever expe rienced. 1 coul d onl y focus my attention on the indi vidua l at rest. 1 kne w that he was a male, but I don' t know how 1 kne w that. I kne w that he was asleep because the ball of energy that hum an beings ordinarily are was a little bit flat; it was expa nde d laterally. And then I saw the assemblage poi nt at a position different from the h abitual one , which is right behind the shou lder blades. In this instance, it had been displaced to the right of where it shoul d have been, and a bit low er. I calculated that in this case it had move d to the side of the ribs. Anot her thing that I not iced wa s that there was no stability to it. It fluctuated erratically and then abruptly went back to its nor mal pos ition. I had the clear sensa tion that, obvi ous ly, my presence, and don Juan's, had awakened the indi vidua l. I had expe rienced a profusion of blurre d images righ t after that, and then I woke up back in the place where I had started. Don Juan had also told me all along that sorcerers were divided into two groups : one group was dream ers; the other was stalkers. The dream ers were thos e who had a great fa cility for displacing the assemblage poi nt. The stalkers were thos e who had a great facility for maintaining the assemblage poi nt fixed on that new pos ition. Dreamers and stalkers com plemented each other, and worked in pairs, affecting one anot her with the ir given proclivities. Don Juan had assured me that the displacement and the fixa tion of the assemblage poi nt coul d be realized at will by means of the sorcerers' iron - hande d discipline. He said that the sorcerers of his lineage believed that there were a t least six hundr ed poi nts within the lum inous sphe re that we are, that when reached at will by the assemblage poi nt, can each give us a totally inclusive world; meaning that, if ou r assemblage poi nt is displaced to"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 any of thos e poi nts and remains fixed on it, we will perceive a world as inclusive and total as the world of everyda y life, but a different world nevertheless. Don Juan had further expl ained that the art of sorcery is to manipul ate the assemblage poi nt and make it change positions at will on the lum inous sphe res that hum an beings are. The result of this manipul ation is a shift in the poi nt of cont act with the dar k sea of aw areness, which brings as its conc om itant a different bun dle of zillions of energy fields in the form of lum inous filaments t hat conve rge on the assemblage poi nt. The cons eque nce of new energy fields conve rging on the assemblage poi nt is that awareness of a different sort than that which is necessary for perceiving the world of everyday life enters into action, turning the new e nergy fields into sensory data, sensory data that is interpreted and per ceived as a different world because the energy fields that enge n der it are different from the habitual ones. He had asserted that an accurate definition of sorcery as a prac tice wou ld be to say that sorcery is the manipul ation of the assem blage poi nt for pur pos es of changi ng its focal poi nt of cont act with the dark sea of aw areness, thus making it pos sible to perceive other worlds. Don Juan had said that the art of the stalkers ente rs into play after the assemblage poi nt has been displaced. Maintaining the assemblage poi nt fixed in its new pos ition assures sorcerers that they will perceive whatever new world they enter in its absolute com pleteness, exactly as we do in the world of or dinary affairs. For the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage, the world of everyda y life was but one fold of a total world cons isting of at least six hundr ed folds.

The jour ney through the dark sea of awareness entailed an immediate respons e. There was an ove rpow ering sensation of the here and now . Don Juan lamented the fact that som e id iotic sorcerers had given the name dreaming - awake to this act of reaching the dark sea of aw are - ness directly, making the term dream ing even more ridiculous . \"When you thought that you had the dream - fantasy of goi ng to that tow n of our choi ce,\" he cont inue d, \"you had actually placed your assemblage poi nt directly on a specific pos ition on the dar k sea of aw areness that allow s the jour ney.

He said that choi ce, for warrior - travelers, was not really the act of choos ing, but rather the act of acqui escing elegantly to the solicitations of infinity. \"Infinity choos es,\" he said. \"The art of the warrior - traveler is to have the ability to move with the slight est insinu ation, the art of acqui e scing to every com mand of infinity.

Once, don Juan had presented to me a metaph or to describe the energetic uni on of strands of hu man beings .

He had main tained, to my chagrin and desponde ncy, that he lived in the shack in the state of Sonor a, Mexico, because that shack depicted my state of awareness. I didn' t qui te believe that he really meant that I was so meager, nor did I believe that he had other place s to live, as he was claiming. It turned out that he was right on bot h coun ts. My state of awareness was very meager, and he did have other places where he coul d live, infinitely more com fortable than the shack where I had first foun d him.

They saw that the dar k sea of aw areness is respons ible not onl y for the awareness of organisms, but also for the awareness of entities that don' t have an organism.\" \"What is this, don Juan, beings without an organism that have awareness?\" I asked, astoni shed, for he had never mentione d such an idea before. \"The old shamans discove red that the entire uni verse is com ' pos ed of twin forces,\" he began, \"forces that are at the same time oppos ed and com plementary to each other. It is inescapable that our world is a twin world. Its oppos ite and com plementary world is one popul ated by beings that have awareness, but not an organ ism.

Don Juan chuc kled for a mom ent before he answered. \"If you call death the termination of a wareness, yes, they die. Their awareness ends . Their death is rather like the death of a hum an being, and at the same time, it isn't, because the death of hum an beings has a hidde n opt ion.

They are th e onl y one s who have, to my know ledge , read the fine print. For them, the opt ion is pertinent and func tiona l. For average hum an beings , death means the termination of their awareness, the end of their organisms. For the ino rganic beings , death means the sa me: the end of their awareness.

Instead of disintegrat ing the organism, as is ordinarily the case, death unifies it.\" \"How can death uni fy anyt hing? \" I protested. \"Death for a sorcerer,\" he said, \"terminates the reign of indi vid ual moods in the body. The old sorcerers believed it was the dom inion of the diff erent parts of the body that ruled the moods and the actions of the total body; parts that becom e dys func tiona l drag the rest of the body to chaos, such as, for instance, when youyour self get sick from eating junk. In that case, the mood of your stom ach af fects everything else. Death eradicates the dom inion of thos e indi vidua l parts. It uni fies their awareness into one singl e uni t.\" \"Do you mean that after they die, sorcerers are still aware?\" I asked. \"For sorcerers, death is an act of uni fication that emp loys every bit of their energy. You are thinki ng of death as a corpse in front of you, a body on which decay has settled. For sorcerers, when the act of uni fication takes place, there is no corpse. There is no decay.

I had no way whatsoever in which to cont ribut e. He left me with a sensation of mystery and unvoi ced expe ctations to be fulfilled. On my next visit to don Juan, I began m y conve rsation by asking him eagerly a que stion that was foremost in my mind. \"Is there a pos sibility, don Juan, that ghos ts and appa ritions really exist?\" \"Whatever you may call a ghos t or an appa rition, \" he said, \"when it is scrutinized by a sorcerer, bo ils dow n to one issue - it is pos sible that any of thos e ghos tlike appa ritions may be a congl om eratation of energy fields that have awareness, and which we turn into things we know .

They told me that it was a coloni al hous e and this first patio was where hor se - drawn carriages had gone in. The second patio was a beautiful orchard zigzagge d by brick lane s of Moor ish design and filled with fruit trees. The third patio was cove red with flow erpot s hangi ng from the eaves of the roof , birds in cages, and a coloni al - style fount ain in the middl e of it with runni ng water, as well as a large area fenced with chick en wire, set aside for my aunt 's prized fight ing cocks, her predilection in life. My aunt made available to me a whol e apartment righ t in front of the fruit orchard. I though t I was goi ng to have the time of my life there. I coul d eat all the fruit that I wanted.

My living situation was ideal for me because I used to go out with my friends and didn 't have to repor t the time I came back to anybody.

Don Juan was sure that it was not a far - fetched idea that my aunt , at a subl iminal level, was not onl y making all thos e noi ses happe n, but that she was capable of much more com plex manipul ations of awareness. Don Juan had also said that to be com pletely fair, he had to adm it the pos si bility that the steps were the produc t of inor ganic awareness. Don Juan said that the inor ganic beings who popul ated our twin world were cons idered, by the sorcerers of his lineage, to be our relatives. Thos e shamans believed that it was futile to make fri ends with ou r family members because the demands levied on us for such friends hips were always exor bitant. He said that that type of inor ganic being, who are our first cous ins, com muni cate with us incessantly, but that their com muni cation with us is not at the level of cons cious awareness. In other words, we know all about them in a subl iminal way, while they know all about us in a deliberate, cons cious manne r. \"The energy from our first cous ins is a drag!\" don Juan went on. \"They are as fucked up as we are .

Don Juan asserted that the old sorcerers had spent genera tions pol ishing their classification schemes, and their conc lusions were that certain type s of inor ganic beings from the categor y of scout s or expl orers, because of their vivacious ness, were akin to man.

They thought of thos e blocks of energy as their helpers, and they relied on them withou t com prehending that, being pur e energy, they didn' t have the pow er to sustain any effort. \"I've told you all there is to know a bout ino rganic beings ,\" don Juan said abrupt ly. \"The onl y way you can put this to the test is by means of direct expe rience.\" I didn' t ask him what he wanted me to do.

It was the end of the day, and the light of the setting su n created in me a mood of desperation. I walked autom atically, aware that I was feeling in my body sensations that were not accom panied by thought s. I was not describing to myself my state of being. I wanted to tell this to don Juan, but the desire to com m uni cate my bodi ly sensations to him vanished in an instant.

What precipitated the final chaotic up heaval in my academic life was my incapacity to focus my interest on topi cs of anthropo logi cal conc ern that didn' t mean a hoot to me, not because of their lack of appe al but because they were mostly matters where words and conc epts had to be manipul ated, as in a legal doc u ment, to obt ain a given result that woul d establish precedents.

The examp le that was put to me was that of the legal system by which we live, and which is or inva luable impo rtance to us. How ever, my rom antic not ions at the time impeded me from conc eiving of myself as a barrister - at - anthrop ology.

My job enga ged my efforts and thought s to their fullest extent. My challenge was to carry out the tasks assigne d to me as perfectly and as rapidly as I coul d. To set up the vinyl sheets with th e images to be processed by silk - screening into decals was a standa rd procedur e that woul dn' t admit of any innova tion, and the efficiency of the worker was measured by exactness and speed. I became a workahol ic and enjoye d myself tremend ous ly. The director of the art department and I became fast friends . He practically took me unde r his wing. His name was Ernest Lipton. I adm ired and respected him immensely. He was a fine artist and a magni ficent craftsman. His flaw was his softness, his incredible cons ider ation for others, which bor dered on passivity. For example, one day we were driving out of the parking lot of a restaurant where we had eaten lunc h. Very pol itely, he waited for anot her car to pul l out of the parking space in front of him. The driver obvi o usly didn' t see us and began to back out at a con siderable speed. Ernest Lipton coul d easily have blow n his hor n to attract the man's attention to watch where he was goi ng.

Then he t urned and apol ogi zed to me. \"Gee, I coul d have blow n my hor n,\" he said, \"but it's so fucking loud, it embarrasses me.\" The guy who had backed up into Ernest's car was furious and had to be placated. \"Don' t worry,\" Ernest said. \"There is no damage to your c ar. Besides, you onl y smashed my headlight s; I was goi ng to replace them anyw ay.\" Anot her day, in the same restaurant, som e Japanese peopl e, clients of the decal com pany and his gue sts for lunc h, were talk ing animatedly to us, asking que stions . The waiter came with the food and cleared the table of som e of the salad plates, making room , the best way he coul d on the narrow table, for the huge hot plates of the entree. One of the Japanese clients needed more space. He pus hed his plate forward; the pus h set E rnest's plate in motion and it began to slide off the table. Again, Ernest coul d have warned the man, but he didn' t. He sat there grinni ng unt il the plate fell in his lap. On anot her occasion, I went to his hous e to help him put up som e rafters ove r his pa tio, where he was goi ng to let a grape vine grow for partial shade and fruit. We prearrange d the rafters into a huge frame and then lifted one side and bol ted it to som e beams. Ernest was a tall, very strong man, and using a lengt h of two - by - fou r as a hoi s ting device, he lifted the other end for me to fit the bol ts into hol es that were already drilled into the suppo rting beams. But before I had a chance to put in the bol ts there was an insistent knoc k on the door and Ernest asked me to see who it was while he held the frame of rafters. His wife was at the door with her grocery packages. She enga ged me in a lengt hy conve rsation and I forgot about Ernest. I even helped her to put her groceries away.

We had to call his friends to lend a hand and hoi st up the frame of rafters - he coul dn' t do it anym ore. He had to go to bed. He thought for sure that he had a hernia. The classic story about Ernest Lipton was that one day he went hiking for the weekend in the San Bernardino Mount ains with som e friends . They camped in the mount ains for the nigh t. While everybody was sleeping, Ernest Lipton went to the bus hes, and being such a cons iderate man, he walked som e distance from the camp so as not to bot her anybody. He slippe d in the darkne ss and rolled dow n the side of the mount ain. He told his friends afterward that he kne w for a fact that he was falling to his death at the bot tom of the valley. He was lucky in that he grabbe d on to a ledge with the tips of his finge rs; he held on to it for hour s, searching in the dark with his feet for any suppor t, because his arms were about to give in - he was goi ng to hol d on unt il his death. By extendi ng his legs as wide as he coul d, he found tiny protube rances in the rock that helped him to hol d on.

Being a very exact man, he qua lified his statement, saying that most of his driving was not done in the city, but on the freeway, although at the peak hour of traffic, he had to slow dow n and accelerate qui te often. A week later, he said that he had reached the 250 - mile - per - gallon mark. This marvelous event escalated unt il he reached an unbe liev able figur e: 64 5 miles to a gallon.

He had the same straight , poi nted nos e and poi nted chin. But seeing Ernest Lipton 's inability to get angr y and punc h the joke rs in the nos e was what really clinched his likeness to my father for me an d pus hed it beyond the threshol d of safety.

H e had empha sized no end that the force that binds that group of energy fields toge ther was, according to the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, the most mysterious force in the uni verse.

Don Juan had said that by means of discipline it is pos sible for anyone to bring the energy body closer to the phys ical body. Normally, the distance between the two is enor mous . Once the energy body is within a certain range , which varies for each of us indi vidua lly, anyone , through discipline, can forge it into the exact replica of their phys ical bod y - that is to say, a three - dimensiona l, solid being.

When don Juan had told me all about this, my reaction had been to ask him if he was describing a mythical propos ition. He had replied that there w as not hing mythical about sorcerers. Sorcerers were practical beings , and what they described was always som ething qui te sobe r and dow n - to - earth.

Don Juan said that if I paid close attention to the darkne ss of the foliage without focusing my eyes, but sort of looke d at it from the corner of my eye, I woul d see a fleeting shadow crossing my field of vision. \"This is the appr opr iate time of day for doi ng what I am asking you to do, \" he said. \"It takes a mom ent to enga ge the necessary attention in you to do it. Don' t stop unt il you catch that fleeting black shadow .\" I did see som e strange fleeting black shadow projected on the foliage of the trees. It was either one shadow goi ng back and forth or various fleeting shadow s movi ng from left to right or right to left or straight up in the air.

He said that that glow ing coat of aw areness was what the predators cons um ed, and that when a hum an being r eached adul thood, all that was left of that glow ing coat of awareness was a narrow fringe that went from the ground to the top of the toes. That fringe permitted mankind to cont inue living, but onl y barely. As if I had been in a dream, I heard don Juan Mat us expl aining that to his know ledge , man was the onl y species that had the glow ing coat of awareness out side that lum inous cocoon. There fore, he became easy prey for an awareness of a different order, such as the heavy awareness of the predator. He then m ade the most damaging statement he had made so far. He said that this narrow fringe of awareness was the epicenter of self - reflection, where man was irremediably caught .

After a mom ent's pause, long enough for me to recove r, I asked don Juan: \"But why is it that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico and all sorcerers toda y, although they see the predators, don' t do any thing about it?\" \"There's not hing that you and I can do about it,\" don Juan said in a grave, sad voi ce. \"All we can do is discipline our s elves to the poi nt where they will not touc h us.

Dow n in the depths of every hum an being, there's an ancestral, visceral know ledge about the predators' existence.\" My analytical mind swung back and forth like a yo - yo. It left me and came back and left me and came back again. Whatever don Juan w as propos ing was prepos terous , incredible. At the same time, it was a most reasona ble thing, so simple. It expl ained every kind of hum an cont radiction I coul d think of. But how coul d one have taken all this serious ly?

At the mom ent he was talking to me that night , in my heart of hearts, I felt that all of what he was say ing was true, but at the same time, and with equa l force, all that he was saying was absur dity itself. \"What are you saying, don Juan?\" I asked feebly. My throat was cons tricted. I coul d hardly breathe. \"What I'm saying is that what we have against us is not a sim ple predator. It is very smart, and organized. It follow s a methodi cal system to rende r us useless. Man, the magical being that he is destined to be, is no longe r magical. He's an average piece of meat. There are no more dreams for man but the d reams of an animal who is being raised to becom e a piece of meat: trite, con ventiona l, imbecilic.\" Don Juan's words were eliciting a strange , bodi ly reaction in me com parable to the sensation of nausea.

The more I thought about it, and the more I talked to and obs erved myself and my fellow men, the more intense the convi ction that som ething was rende ring us incapable of any activity or any interaction or any thought that didn' t have the self as its f ocal poi nt. My conc ern, as well as the conc ern of everyone I kne w or talked to, was the self. Since I coul dn' t find any expl anation for such uni versal hom oge neity, I believed that don Juan's line of thought was the most appr op riate way of elucidating the p henom enon.

I was deeply invol ved in thinki ng abou t the task he had delin eated for me. I began by trying to review in my mind if I kne w of any articles or papers written o n this subj ect.

We went for a hike toda y, we talked, because the mystery of sorcery must be cus hione d in the munda ne. It must stem from not hing, and go back again to not hing.

I will be by you, in case you faint or fall dow n.\" \"What are you planni ng to do, don Juan?\" I asked, and my alarm was so patent that I not iced it and low ered my voi ce. \"I want you to cross your legs and enter into inne r silence , \" he said. \"Let's sa y that you want to find out what articles you coul d look for to discredit or subs tantiate what I have asked you to do in your academic milieu.

I succeeded, and found myself looki ng at the bot tom of the valley from an impenetrable darkn ess around me. And then, I saw som ething that chilled me to the marrow of my bone s. I saw a gigantic shadow , perhaps fifteen feet across, leaping in the air and then landi ng with a silent thud.

I fought not to lose my conc entration. I was fright ened beyond any thing I coul d rationa lly use as a description. I kept my eyes fixed on the jum ping shadow on the bot tom of the valley. Then I heard a most peculiar buz zing, a mixture o f the sound of flappi ng wings and the buz zing of a radio whos e dial has not qui te picked up the freque ncy of a radio station, and the thu d that follow ed was som e thing unf orgettable. It shook don Juan and me to the core - a gigantic black mud shadow had just lande d by our feet. \"Don' t be frightened,\" don Juan said imperious ly. \"Keep your inne r silence and it will move away.\" I was shivering from head to toe. I had the clear know ledge that if I didn' t keep my inne r silence alive, the mud shadow woul d cove r me up like a blanke t and suffocate me. Without losing the darkne ss around me, I screamed at the top of my voi ce. Never had I been so angr y, so utterly frustrated. The mud shadow took anot her leap, clearly to the bot tom of the valley. I kept on screaming, shak ing my legs. I wanted to shake off whatever might com e to eat me. My state of nervous ness was so intense that I lost track of time. Perhaps I fainted.

One of don Juan's female cohor ts rubbe d my back, chest, and forehead with rubbi ng alcohol , but this did not relieve me. The heat I was expe riencing came from within myself.

Don Juan twisted with laught er. \"You shoul dn' t wear a watch when you com e to see me,\" he said. \"Now you' ve foul ed up your watch!\" I took off my watch and put it by the side of the tub.

When don Juan pul led me o ut of the freezing water, I had gained a degree of con trol. \"That sight is prepos terous !\" I kept on repeating, una ble to say anyt hing else. The predator don Juan had described was not som ething benevol ent. It was enor mous ly heavy, gross, indi fferent. I felt its disregard for us. Doubt less, it had crushed us ages ago, making us, as don Juan had said, weak, vul nerable, and doc ile. I took off my wet clothes, cove red myself with a ponc ho, sat in my bed, and veritably wept my head off, but not for myself. I h ad my wrath, my unbe ndi ng intent, not to let them eat me.

Once we were on the mesa itself, I realized that it was not as extensive as it had appe ared when 1 had looke d at it from a distance. The vegetation on the mesa was not different from the vegetation below : faded green woody shrubs that had the ambiguous appe ar ance of trees. At first, I didn' t see the chasm. It was onl y when don Juan led me to it that 1 became aware that the mesa ende d in a precipice; it wasn't really a mesa but merely the flat top of a good - sized mount ain. The moun tain was round and erode d on its east and sout h faces; how ever, on part of its west and nor th sides, it seemed to have been cut with a kni fe. From the edge of the precipice, 1 was able to see the bot tom of the ravine, perhaps six h undr ed feet below . It was cove red with the same woody shrubs that grew everyw here. A whol e row of small mount ains to the sout h and to the nor th of that mount aintop gave the clear impression that they had been part of a gigantic canyon, millions of years ol d, dug out by a no longe r existing river. The edge s of that canyon had been erased by erosion. At certain poi nts they had been leveled with the ground. The onl y por tion still intact was the area where I was standi ng. \"It's solid rock,\" don Juan said as if he were reading my thought s.

Prior to goi ng there, he had told me that his time on Earth had com e to an end. He was leaving on his definitive jour ney. His statements were devastating to me. I truly lost my grip, and entered into a blissful state of fragm enta tion, perhaps similar to what peopl e expe rience when they have a mental breakdow n. But there was a core fragm ent of myself that remained cohe sive: the me of my childhood. The rest was vague - ness, incertitude . I had been fragm ented for so long that to becom e fragm ented onc e again was the onl y way out of my devas tation. A most peculiar interplay between different levels of my aware ness took place afterward. Don Juan, his cohor t don Genaro, two of his appr entices, Pablito and Nestor, and I had climbed to that moun taintop. Pablito, Nestor, and I were there to take care of our last task as appr entices: to jum p into an abys s, a most mysterious affair, which don Juan had expl ained to me at various levels of awareness but which has remained an enigm a to me to this day. Don Juan joki ngl y said that I shoul d get my writing pad and start taking not es about our last mom ents toge ther. He gently poke d me in the ribs and assured me, as he hid his laught er, that it woul d have been onl y prope r, since I had star ted on the warrior' travelers' path by taking not es. Don Genaro cut in and said that other warrior - travelers before us had stood on that same flat mount aintop before embarking on their jour ney to the unknow n. Don Juan turned to me and in a soft voi ce said that soon I woul d be entering into infinity by the force of my persona l pow er, and that he and don Genaro were there onl y to bid me farewell.

But if you choos e to com e back, you must tight en your belt and wait like a true warrior - trav eler unt il your task, whatever it might be, is finished, either in success or in defeat.\" A very subt le change began to take place in my awareness then. I started to remember faces of peopl e, but I wasn't sure I had met them; strange feelings of angui sh and affection started to mount . Don Juan's voi ce was no lon ger audi ble. I longe d for peo ple I sincerely doubt ed I had ever met. I was sudde nly pos sessed by the most unbe arable love for those persons , whoe ver they may have been. My feelings for them were beyon d words, and yet I coul dn' t tell who they were. I onl y sensed their presence, as if I had lived anot her life before, or as if I were feeling for peop le in a dream. I sensed that their out side forms shifted; they began by being tall and ende d up petite. What was left intact was their essence, the very thing tha t produc ed my unbe arable longi ng for them. Don Juan came to my side and said to me, \"The agreement was that you remain in the awareness of the daily world.\" His voi ce was harsh and author itative. \"Toda y you are goi ng to fulfill a con crete task,\" he went o n, \"the last link of a long chain; and you must do it in your utmost moo d of reason. \""},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 254 I had never heard don Juan talk to me in that tone of voi ce.

I didn' t kno w that I was doi ng this, how ever. To me, it appe ared, on that day, as if I had acqui esced to don Juan out of fear and respect. Don Juan spoke to me next in the tone I was accustom ed to. What he said was also very familiar. He said that the backbone of a warrior - traveler is hum bleness and efficiency, acting without expe cting anyt hing and withstandi ng anyt hing that lies ahead of him. I went at that poi nt throug h anot her shift in my level of aware ness. My mind focused on a thought , or a feeling of angui sh.

My a ngui sh became unbe arable. Don Juan spoke to me. \"We are alone ,\" he said. \"That's our condi tion, but to die alone is not to die in lone liness.\" I took big gul ps of air to erase my tension. As I breathed deeply, my mind became clear. \"The great issue with us males is our frailty,\" he went on. \"When our awareness begins to grow , it grow s like a colum n, right on the midpoi nt of our lum inous being, from the grou nd up.

You know to perfec tion what you have to do, but this know ledge is not qui te formu lated in your thought s yet.\" On the level of conc rete thought s or sensations , all I had were vague feelings of know ing som ething that was not part of my mind. I had, then, the clearest sense of having taken a huge step dow n; som ething seemed to have droppe d inside me. It was almost a jolt. I knew that I had entered in to anot her level of awareness at that instant. Don Juan told me then that it is obl igatory that a warrior - traveler say good - bye to all the peopl e he leaves behind. He must say his good - bye in a loud and clear voi ce so that his shout and his feelings will r emain forever recorded in thos e mount ains. I hesitated for a long time, not out of bashfulness but because I didn' t know whom to include in my thanks . I had com pletely internalized the sorcerers' conc ept that warrior - travelers can't ow e anyt hing to anyone .

My grandf ather had accused this man repeatedly of stealing chickens from his chicken farm. The man wasn't a vagrant, but som eone who did not have a steady, definite job. He was a maverick of sorts, a gambler, a mas ter of many trades: handym an, self - styled curer, hunt er and provi der of plant and insect specimens for local herbalists and curers and any kind of bird or mammal life for taxidermists or pet shops .

One day, while I was taking a stroll on the edge of my grandf a ther's farm, I not iced that som eone was watching me from between the thick bus hes at the forest's edge . It was Mr. Acosta. He was squa tting inside the bus hes of the jungl e itself and woul d have been totally out of sight had it not been for my sharp eight - year - old eyes. \"No wonde r my grand father thinks that he com es to steal chickens,\" I thought . I believed that no one else but me coul d have not iced him; he was utterly conc ealed by his motion lessness. I had caught the difference between the bus hes and his sil houe tte by feeling rather than sight . I appr oached him. The fact that peopl e rejected him so vicious ly, or liked him so passiona tely, intrigued me no e nd. \"What are you doi ng there, Mr. Acosta?\" I asked daringl y. \"I'm taking a shit while I look at your grand father's farm,\" he said, \"so you better scram before 1 get up unl ess you like the smell of shit.\" I move d away a shor t distance. I wanted to know if he was really doi ng what he was claiming. He was. He got up. I thought he was goi ng to leave the bus h and com e ont o my grandf ather's land and perhaps walk across to the road, but he didn' t. He began to walk inw ard, into the jungl e. \"Hey, hey, Mr. Acosta!\" I yelled. \"Can I come with you? \" I not iced that he had stoppe d walking; it was again more a feel ing than an actual sight because the bus h was so thick. \"You can certainly com e with me if you can find an entry into the"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 258 bus h,\" he said. That wasn't difficult for me. In my hour s of idleness, I had marked an entry into the bus h with a good - sized rock. 1 had found out throu gh an endl ess process of trial and error that there was a crawling space there, which if I follow ed for three or four yards turned into an ac tual trail on which I coul d stand up and walk. Mr. Acosta came to me and said, \"Bravo, kid! You' ve done it. Yes, com e with me if you want to.\" That was the beginni ng of my association with Mr. Leandr o Acosta. We went on daily hunt ing expe ditions. Our assoc iation became so obvi ous , since I was gone from the hous e from dawn to suns et, without anybody ever know ing where I went, that finally my grandfather adm on ished me severely. \"You must select your acqua intances,\" he said, \"or you will end up being like them . I will not tolerate this man affecting you in any way imaginable. He coul d certainly transmit to you his elan, yes. And he coul d influence your mind to be just like his: useless. I'm telling you, if you don 't put an end to this, I will. I'll send the aut hor ities after him on charges of stealing my chickens, because you know damn well that he com es every day and steals them.\" I tried to show my grandf ather the absurdity of his charges. Mr. Acosta didn' t have to steal chickens. He had the vastness of that j ungl e at his com mand. He coul d have drawn from that jungl e anyt hing he wanted. But my argum ents infuriated my grandf ather even more.

Then, one day, Mr. Acosta and three of his friends prop osed that I do som ething that Mr. Acosta had never done before: catch a vul ture alive, uni n jured. He expl ained to me that the vul tures of the area, which were enor mous , with a five - to six - foot wings pan, had seven dif - ferent type s of flesh in their bod ies, and each one of thos e seven type s served a specific curative pur pos e. He said that the desired state was that the vul ture's body not be injured. The vul ture had to be killed by tranqui lizer, not by violence. It was easy to shoot them, but in that case, the meat lost its curative value. So the art was to catch them alive, a thing that he had never done . He had figur ed out , though, that with my help and the help of his three friends he had the probl em licked. He assured me that his was a natura l conc lusion arrived at after hundr eds of occasions on which he had obs erved the behavior of vul tures. \"We need a dead donke y in order to perform this feat, som e thing which we have,\" he declared ebul liently. He looke d at me, waiting for me to ask the que s tion of what woul d be done with the dead donke y. Since the que stion was not asked, he proceeded. \"We remove the intestines, and we put som e sticks in there to keep the roundne ss of the belly. \"The leader of the turkey vul tures is the king; he is the bigge st, the most intelligent,\" he went on. \"No sharper eyes exist. That's what makes him a king. He'll be the one who will spot the dead donke y, and the first who will land on it. He'll land dow nw i nd from the do nke y to really smell that it is dead.

Neither Mr. Acosta nor his friends expl ained to me whether they had found or killed the dead donke y. I waited for them to tell me, but I wasn 't goi ng to ask. While they made the prepara tions , Mr. Acosta expl ained that the tent was in place because vul tures were on the lookout from huge distances out there, cir cling very high, out of sight , but certainly capable of seeing every thing that was goi ng on. \"Thos e creatures are creatures of sight alone ,\" Mr. Acosta said. \"They have miserable ears, and their nos es are not as good as their eyes.

I wasn't goi ng to ge t sick and miss the event of events. The dreaded mom ent came when Mr. Acosta put me inside the donke y. Then they stretched the skin ove r the armature and began to sew it closed. They left, nevertheless, a large area ope n at the bot tom , against the ground, for air to circulate in. The hor rendo us mom ent for me came when the skin was finally closed ove r my head like the lid of a coffin. I breathed hard, thinki ng onl y abou t the excitement of grabbi ng the king of vul tures by the neck. Mr. Acosta gave me last - mi nut e instruction s.

I heard him yelling, \"Let go, boy, let go, he's goi ng to fly away with you! \" The king vul ture inde ed was goi ng to either fly away with me hol ding on to his neck or rip me apart with the force of his talons . The reason he coul dn' t reach me was because his h ead was sunk halfway into the viscera and the armature. His talons kept slip ping on the loos e intestines and they never actually touc hed me. Anot her thing that saved me was that the force of the vul ture was invol ved in pul ling his neck out from my clasp a nd he coul d not move his talons far forward enough to really injure me. The next thing I kne w, Mr. Acosta had lande d on top of the vul ture at the precise mom ent that my leather glove s came off my hands . Mr. Acosta was beside himself with joy. \"We've done i t, boy, we've done it!\" he said. \"The next time, we will have longe r stakes on the ground that the vul ture cannot yank out , and you will be strappe d to the structure.\""},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 264 My relations hip with Mr. Acosta had lasted long enough for us to catch a vul ture. Then my interest in follow ing him disappe ared as mysterious ly as it had appe ared and I never really had the oppor tuni ty to thank him for all the things that he had taught me. Don Juan said that he had taught me the patience of a hunt er at the best time to learn it; and above all, he had taught me to draw from solitariness all the com fort that a hunt er needs. \"You cannot conf use solitude with solitariness,\" don Juan expl ained t o me onc e. \"Solitude for me is psychol ogi cal, of the mind. Solitariness is phys ical. One is debilitating, the other com forting. \" For all this, don Juan had said, I was inde bted to Mr. Acosta forever whether or not 1 unde rstoo d inde btedne ss the way warrior - travelers unde rstand it. The second person don Juan thought I was inde bted to was a ten - year - old child I'd kno wn grow ing up. His name was Armando Velez. Just like his name, he was extremely digni fied, starchy, a little old man. I liked him very much because he was firm and yet ver y friendl y. He was som eone who coul d not easily be intimi dated. He woul d fight anyone if he needed to and yet he was not a bul ly at all. The two of us used to go on fishing expe ditions . We used to catch very small fish that lived unde r rocks and had to be gath ered by hand. We woul d put the tiny fish we caught to dry in the sun and eat them raw, all day som etimes. I also liked the fact that he was very resour ceful and clever as well as being ambidextrous . He coul d throw a rock with his left hand farther th an with his right . We had endl ess com petitive games in which, to my ultimate chagrin, he always won. He used to sort of apol ogi ze to me for winn ing by"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 265 saying, \"If I slow dow n and let you win, you'll hate me. It'll be an affront to your man hood. So try har der.\" Because of his excessively starchy behavior, we used to call him \"Senor Velez,\" but the \"Senor \" was shor tened to \"Sho, \" a custom typi cal of the region in Sout h America where I com e from . One day, Sho Velez asked me som ething qui te unus ual. He began h is reque st, naturally, as a challenge to me. \"I bet any thing, \" he said, \"that I know som ething that you wou ldn' t dare do. \" \"What are you talking about , Sho Velez?\" \"You woul dn' t dare go dow n a river in a raft.\" \"Oh yes I woul d. I've done it in a floode d r iver. I got strande d on an island for eight days onc e. They had to drift food to me.\" This was the truth. My other best friend was a child nickna med Crazy Shephe rd. We got strande d in a flood on an island onc e, with no way for anyone to rescue us. Tow nspeo ple expe cted the flood to ove rrun the island and kill us bot h. They drifted baskets of foo d dow n the river in the hope that they woul d land on the island, which they did. They kept us alive in this fashion unt il the water had subs ided enoug h for them to re ach us with a raft and pul l us to the banks of the river. \"No, this is a different affair,\" Sho Velez cont inue d with his erudi te attitude . \"This one implies goi ng on a raft on a subt er ranean river.\" He poi nted out that a huge section of a local river went through a mount ain. That subt erranean section of the river had always been a most intriguing place for me. Its entrance into the mount ain was a forebodi ng cave of cons iderable size, always filled with bats and smelling of ammoni a. Children of the area wer e told that it was the entrance to hell: sulfur fum es, heat, stench."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 266 \"You bet your friggin' bo ots, Sho Velez, that I will never go near that river in my lifetime!\" I said, yelling. \"Not in ten life times! You have to be really crazy to do som ething like th at.\" Sho Velez's serious face got even more solemn. \"Oh,\" he said, \"then I will have to do it all by myself. I thought for a minut e that I coul d goa d you into goi ng with me. I was wrong. My loss.\" \"Hey, Sho Velez, what's with you? Why in the world woul d yo u go into that hellish place?\" \"I have to,\" he said in his gruff little voi ce. \"You see, my father is as crazy as you are, except that he is a father and a hus band. He has six peopl e who depend on him. Otherwise, he woul d be as crazy as a goa t. My two sist ers, my two brothers, my mother and I depend on him. He is everything to us.\" I didn' t kn ow who Sho Velez's father was. I had never seen him. I didn' t kno w what he did for a living. Sho Velez revealed that his father was a bus inessman, and that everything that he ow ned was on the line, so to speak. \"My father has cons tructed a raft and wants to go. He wants to make that expe dition. My mother says that he's just letting off steam, but I don' t trust him,\" Sho Velez cont inue d. \"I have seen your crazy look in h is eyes. One of these days, he'll do it, and I am sure that he'll die. So, I am goi ng to take his raft and go into that river myself. I know that I will die, but my father won 't.\" I felt som ething like an electric shoc k go through my neck, and I heard myse lf saying in the most agitated tone one can imagine, \"I'll do it, Sho Velez, I'll do it. Yes, yes, it'll be great! I'll go with you! \" Sho Velez had a smirk on his face. I unde rstood it as a smirk of happi ness at the fact that I was goi ng with him, not at t he fact that he had"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 267 succeeded in luring me. He expr essed that feeling in his next sentence. \"I know that if you are with me, I will survive,\" he said. I didn' t care whether Sho Velez survived or not . What had gal vanized me was his cour age. I kne w that Sho Velez had the gut s to do what he was saying. He and Crazy Shephe rd were the only gut sy kids in tow n. They bot h had som ething that I cons idered uni que and unhe ard of: cour age. No one else in that whol e tow n had any. I had tested them all. As far as I was c onc erned, every one of them was dead, includi ng the love of my life, my grandf a ther. I kne w this without the shadow of a doubt when I was ten. Sho Velez's daring was a stagge ring realization for me. I wanted to be with him to the bitter end. We made plans to meet at the crack of dawn, which we did, and the two of us carried his father's ligh tweight raft for three or fou r miles out of tow n, into som e low , green mount ains to the entrance of the cave where the river became subt erranean. The smell of bat manur e was ove rwhelming. We crawled on the raft and pus hed our selves into the stream. The raft was equi ppe d with flashlight s, which we had to turn on immediately. It was pitch black inside the mount ain and hum id and hot. The water was deep enough for the raft a nd fast enough that we didn 't need to paddl e. The flashligh ts woul d create grotesque shadow s. Sho Velez whispered in my ear that perhaps it was better not to look at all, because it was truly som ething more than frigh tening. He was right ; it was nauseating , oppr essive. The light s stirred bats so that they began to fly around us, flappi ng their wings aimlessly. As we traveled deeper into the cave, there were not even bats anym ore, just stagna nt air that was heavy and hard to breathe. After what seemed like h our s to me, we came to a sort of pool where the water was very deep; it hardly move d. It looke d as if the main"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 268 stream had been dammed. \"We are stuck,\" Sho Velez whispered in my ear again. \"There's no way for the raft to go through, and there's no way for u s to go back.\" The current was just too great for us to even attempt a return trip. We decided that we had to find a way out . I realized then that if we stood on top of the raft, we coul d touc h the ceiling of the cave, which meant that the water had been d ammed almost all the way to the top of the cave. At the entrance it was cathedral - like, maybe fifty feet high. My onl y conc lusion was that we were on top of a pool that was about fifty feet deep. We tied the raft to a rock and began to swim dow nw ard into t he depths, trying to feel for a move ment of water, a current. Everything was hum id and hot on the surface but very cold a few feet below . My body felt the change in temperature and I became fright ened, a strange animal fear that 1 had never felt before. I surfaced. Sho Velez must have felt the same. We bum ped into each other on the surface. \"I think we're close to dyi ng, \" he said solemnly. 1 didn' t share his solemnity or his desire to die. I searched fran tically for an ope ning. Flood waters must have carrie d rocks that had created a dam. 1 found a hol e big enough for my ten - year - old body to go throug h. 1 pul led Sho Velez dow n and show ed the hol e to him. It was impos sible for the raft to go through it. We pul led our clothes from the raft and tied them into a very tight bund le and swam dow nw ard with them unt il we found the hol e again and went through it. We ende d up on a water slide, like the one s in an amusement park. Rocks cove red with lichen and moss allow ed us to slide for a great distance without being injured at all. Then we came into an enor mous cathedral - like cave, where the water cont inue d flow ing, waist deep. We saw"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 269 the light of the sky at the end of the cave and waded out . Without saying a word, we spre ad out our clothes and let them dry in the sun, then headed back for tow n. Sho Velez was nearly incons olable because he had lost his father's raft. \"My father woul d have died there,\" he finally conc eded. \"His body woul d never have gone throug h the hol e we went through. He's too big for it. My father is a big, fat man,\" he said. \"But he woul d have been strong enough to walk his way back to the entrance.\" I doubt ed it. As I remembered, at times, due to the inclination, the current was astoundi ngl y fast. I con ceded that perhaps a des perate, big man coul d have finally walked his way out with the aid of rope s and a lot of effort. The issue of whether Sho Velez's father would have died there or not was not resolved then, but that didn' t matter to me. What mat ter ed was that for the first time in my life I had felt the sting of envy. Sho Velez was the onl y being I have ever envi ed in my life. He had som eone to die for, and he had prove d to me that he woul d do it; I had no one to die for, and I had prove d not hing at all. In a sym bol ic fashion, I gave Sho Velez the total cake. His tri um ph was com plete. I bow ed out . That was his tow n, thos e were his peopl e, and he was the best among them as far as I was con cerned. When we parted that day, I spoke a banality that turn ed out to be a deep truth when I said, \"Be the king of them, Sho Velez. You are the best.\" I never spoke to him again. I pur pos ely ende d my friends hip with him. I felt that this was the onl y gesture I coul d make to denot e how profou ndl y I had been affected by him. Don Juan believed that my inde btedne ss to Sho Velez was"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 270 imperishable, that he was the onl y one who had ever taught me that we must have som ething we coul d die for before we coul d think that we have som ething to live for. \"If you have not hing to die for,\" don Juan said to me onc e, \"how can you claim that you have som ething to live for? The two go hand in hand, with death at the helm.\" The third person do n Juan thought I was inde bted to beyond my life and my death was my gra ndm other on my mother's side. In my blind affection for my grand father - the male : - I had for - gotten the real sour ce of strengt h in that hous ehol d: my very eccentric grandm other. Many years before I came to their hous ehol d, she had saved a local Indi an from b eing lync hed. He was accused of being a sor cerer. Som e irate young men were actually hangi ng him from a tree on my grandm other's prope rty. She came upon the lync hing and stoppe d it. All the lync hers seemed to have been her gods ons and they woul dn 't dare g o against her. She pul led the man dow n and took him hom e to cure him. The rope had already cut a deep wound on his neck. His wounds healed, but he never left my grandm other's side. He claimed that his life had ende d the day of the lync hing, and that whatev er new life he had no longe r belonge d to him; it belonge d to her. Being a man of his word, he dedicated his life to serving my grandm other. He was her valet, majordom o, and couns elor. My aunt s said that it was he who had advi sed my grandm other to adopt a n ewbor n orpha n child as her son, som e - thing that they resented more than bitterly. When I came into my grandpa rents' hous e, my grand mother's adopt ed son was already in his late thirties. She had sent him to study in France. One afternoo n, out of the blue, a most elegantly dressed hus ky man got out of a"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 271 taxi in front of the hous e. The driver carried his leather suitcases to the patio. The hus ky man tippe d the driver generous ly. I not iced in one glance that the hus ky man's features were very striking. He had long, curly hair, long, curly eyelashes. He was extremely hand som e without being phys ically beautiful. His best feature was, how ever, his beaming, ope n smile, which he immediately turned on me. \"May I ask your name, young man?\" he said with the most beaut iful stage voi ce I had ever heard. The fact that he had addr essed me as young man had won me ove r instantly. \"My name is Carlos Aranha , sir,\" I said, \"and may I ask in turn what is your s?\" He made a gesture of mock surprise. He opened his eyes wide and jum ped backw ard as if he had been attacked. Then he began to laugh upr oarious ly. At the sound of his laught er, my grand mother came out to the patio. When she saw the hus ky man, she screamed like a small girl and threw her arms around him in a most affectiona te embrace. He lifted her up as if she weighe d not hing and twirled her around. I not iced then that he was very tall. His hus kiness hid his height . He actually had the body of a professiona l fighter. He seemed to not ice that I was eyeing him. He flexed his biceps. \"I've done som e boxi ng in my day, sir,\" he said, thor oughl y aware of what I was thinki ng. My grandm other introduc ed him to me. She said that he was her son Antoine, her baby, the appl e of her eye; she said that he was a dramatist, a theater directo r, a writer, a poe t. The fact that he was so athletic was his winning ticket with me. I didn' t unde rstand at first that he was adopt ed. I not iced, how ever, that he"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 272 didn' t look at all like the rest of the family. While every one of the members of my family were corpses that walked, he was alive, vital from the inside out . We hit it off marvelous ly. I liked the fact that he worked out every day, punc hing a bag. I liked immensely that not onl y did he punc h the bag, he kicked it, too, in the most astoundi ng s tyle, a mixture of boxi ng and kicking. His body was as hard as a rock. One day Antoine conf essed to me that his only fervent desire in life was to be a writer of not e. \"I have everything, \" he said. \"Life has been very generous to me. The onl y thing I don 't have is the onl y thing I want: talent. The muses do not like me. I appr eciate what I read, but I cannot create anyt hing that I like to read. That's my torment; I lack the discipline or the charm to entice the muses, so my life is as empty as anyt hing can be.\" Antoine went on to tell me that the one reality that he had was his mother. He called my grandm other his bastion, his sup por t, his twin soul . He ende d up by voi cing a very disturbing thou ght to me. \"If I didn' t have my mother,\" he said, \"I woul dn' t l ive.\" I realized then how profoundl y tied he was to my grandm other. All the hor ror stories that my aunt s had told me about the spoi led child Antoine became sudde nly very vivid for me. My grand mother had really spoi led him beyond salvation. Yet they seemed so very happy toge ther. I saw them sitting for ho urs on end, his head on her lap as if he were still a child. I had never heard my grandm other conve rse with anybody for such lengt hs of time. Abrupt ly, one day Antoine started to produ ce a lot of writing. H e began to direct a play at the local theater, a play that he had written himself. When it was staged, it became an instant success. His poe ms were publ ished"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 273 in the local paper. He seemed to have hit a creative streak. But onl y a few mont hs later it all ca me to an end. The editor of the tow n's paper publ icly denounc ed Antoine; he accused him of plagiarism and publ ished in the paper the proof of Antoine's gui lt. My grandm other, of cour se, woul d not hear of her son' s misbehavior. She expl ained it all as a cas e of profound envy. Every one of thos e peopl e in that tow n was envi ous of the elegance, the style of her son. They were envi ous of his persona lity, of his wit. Inde ed, he was the personi fication of elegance and savoi r faire. But he was a plagiarist for sur e; there was no doubt about it. Antoine never expl ained his behavior to anyone . I liked him too much to ask him anyt hing about it. Besides, I didn't care. His reasons were his reasons , as far as I was conc erned. But som ething was broke n; from then on, our lives move d in leaps and bounds , so to speak. Things change d so drastically in the hous e from one day to the next that I grew accustom ed to expe ct anyt hing, the best or the worst. One night my grand mother walked into Antoine's room in a most dramatic fashi on. There was a look of hardne ss in her eyes that I had never seen before. Her lips trem bled as she spoke . \"Som ething terrible has happe ned, Antoine,\" she began. Antoine interrupt ed her. He begge d her to let him expl ain. She cut him off abruptly. \"No, Antoine, no, \" she said firmly. \"This has not hing to do with you. It has to do with me. At this very difficult time for you, som ething of greater impor tance yet has happe ned. Antoine, my dear son, I have run out of time. \"I wa nt you to unde rstand that this is inevitable,\" she went on. \"I have to leave, but you must remain.

In the end, we will be toge ther a gain anyw ay. Meanw hile, how ever, do, Antoine, do. Whatever, it doe sn't matter what, as long as you do. \" I saw Antoine's body as it shivered with angui sh. I saw how he cont racted his total being, all the muscles of his body, all his strengt h. It was as if h e had shifted gears from his probl em, which was like a river, to the ocean. \"Prom ise me that you won' t die unt il you die!\" she shout ed at him. Antoine nodde d his head. My grandm other, the next day, on the advi ce of her sorcerer - couns elor, sold all her hol d ings , which were qui te sizable, and turned the mone y ove r to her son Antoine. And the follow ing day, very early in the morning, the strange st scene that I had ever witnessed took place in front of my ten - year - old eyes: the mom ent in which Antoine said go od - bye to his mother. It was a scene as unr eal as the set of a movi ng picture; un real in the sense that it seemed to have been conc octed, written dow n som ewhere, created by a series of adjustments that a writer makes and a direc tor carries out . The patio of my grandpa rents' hous e was the setting. Antoine was the main protago nist, his mother the leading actress. Antoine was traveling that day. He was goi ng to the por t. He was goi ng to catch an Italian liner and go ove r the Atlantic to Europe on a leisurely cruise. He was as elegantly dressed as ever. A taxi driver was waiting for him out side the hous e, blow ing the hor n of his taxi impatiently. I had witnessed Antoine's last feverish nigh t when he tried as desperately as anyone can try to write a poe m for his mother. \"It is crap,\" he said to me. \"Everything that I write is crap. I'm a"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 275 nobody. \" I assured him, even though I was nobody to assure him, that whatever he was writing was great.

I have not hing. Whatever you are writing is fine.\" Very pol itely, he asked me to leave his room. I had succeeded in making him feel stupi d, hav ing to listen to advi ce from a nobody kid. I bitterly regretted my out bur st. I woul d have liked him to keep on being my friend. Antoine had his elegant ove rcoat neatly folded, draped ove r his right shoul der. He was wearing a most beautiful green suit, Engl ish cashm ere. My grandm other spoke . \"You have to hur ry up, dear,\" she said. \"Time is of the essence. You have to leave. If you don' t, these peopl e will kill you for the mone y.\" She was referring to her daugh ters, and their hus bands , who were beyond fury wh en they found out that their mother had qui etly disinhe rited them, and that the hideous Antoine, their arch enemy, was goi ng to get away with everything that was right fully theirs. \"I'm sorry I have to put you through all this,\" my grandm other apol ogi zed. \"But, as you know , time is inde pende nt of our wishes.\" Antoine spoke with his grave, beautifully modul ated voi ce. He sounde d more than ever like a stage actor. \"It'll take but a minut e, Mother,\" he said. \"I'd like to read som ething that I have written for you. \" It was a poe m of thanks . When he had finished reading, he paused.

Antoine's smile in respons e to his mother was equa lly beaming. \"Of cour se, Mother,\" he said. \"Of cour se.\" They embraced, weeping. The hor n of the taxi sounde d more impatient yet. Antoine looke d at me where I was hiding unde r the stairway. He nodde d his head slight ly, as if to say, \"Good - bye . Take care.\" Then he turned aroun d, and without looki ng at his mother again, he ran tow ard the door . He was thirty - seven years old, but he looke d like he was sixty, he seemed to carry such a gigantic weight on his shoul ders. He stoppe d before he reached the door , when he heard his mother's voi ce adm oni shing him for the last time. \"Don' t turn around to look, Antoine,\" she said. \"Don' t turn around to look, ever. Be happy, and do. Do! There is the trick. Do!\" The scene filled me with a strange sadne ss that lasts to this day - a most inexpl icable melancho ly that don Juan expl ained as my first - time know ledge that we do run out of time. The next day my grandm other left with her couns elor/manser - vant/valet on a jour ney to a mythical place called Rondoni a, where her sorcerer - helper was goi ng to elicit her cure. My grand mother was termi nally ill, although I didn 't know it. She never returned, and don Juan expl ained the selling of her hol dings and giving them to Antoine as a supr eme sorcerers' maneuve r exe cuted by her couns elor to detach her from the care of her family. They were so angr y with Mother for her deed that they didn' t care whether or not she returned. I had the feeling that they didn' t even realize"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" 277 that she had left. On the top of that flat mount ain, I recollected thos e three events as if they had happe ned onl y an instant befo re. When I expr essed my thanks to thos e three persons , 1 succeeded in bring ing them back to that mount aintop. At the end of my shout ing, my lone liness was som ething inexpr essible. 1 was weeping unc on trollably. Don Juan very patiently expl ained to me that lone liness is inadm issible in a warrior. He said that warrior - travelers can count on one being on which they can focus all their love , all their care: this marvelous Earth, the mother, the matrix, the epicenter of everything we are and everything we do; t he very being to which all of us return; the very being that allow s warrior - travelers to leave on their definitive jour ney. Don Genaro proceeded to perform then an act of magical intent for my benefit. Lying on his stom ach, he executed a series of daz zling move ments. He became a blob of lum inos ity that seemed to be swimming, as if the ground were a pool . Don Juan said that it was Genaro's way of huggi ng the immense earth, and that in spite of the difference in size, the earth acknow ledge d Genaro's gest ure. The sight of Genaro's move ments and the expl anation of them replaced my lone liness with subl ime joy. \"I can't stand the idea that you are leaving, don Juan,\" I heard myself saying. The sound of my voi ce and what I had said made me feel embarrassed. Wh en 1 began to sob, invol unt arily, driven by self - pity, I felt even more chagrined. \"What is the matter with me, don Juan?\" I muttered. \"I'm not ordinarily like this.\" \"What's happe ning to you is that your awareness is on your toes again,\" he replied, laugh ing.

It was a qua si - memory that didn' t stem from situations in which my life had been enda nge red. It was som ething qui te different from that.

I was now in my apartment in Los Ange les, ove r three thous and miles from where I had jum ped, with no recollec tion whatsoever of having made the return trip. In an autom atic fashion, I ran the water in the tub and sat in it. I didn' t feel the warmth of the water; I was chilled to the bone . Don Juan had taught me that at mom ents of crisis, such as this one , one must use runni ng water as a cleansing factor. I remembered this and got unde r the show er. I let the warm water run ov er my body for per haps ove r an hour . I wanted to think calmly and rationally abo ut what was hap pening to me but I coul dn' t.

All I was able to do was to feel their ons laught s and let them go through me. The onl y cons cious choi ce I made was to get dressed and leave. I went to eat break - fast, som ething I always did at any ti me of the day or night , at Ship's Restaurant on Wilshire, a block away from my office/apart ment. I had walked from my office to Ship's so many times that I kne w every step of the way. The same walk this time was a nov elty for me. I didn 't feel my steps. It was as if I had a cushion unde r my feet, or as if the sidewalk were carpeted. I practically glided. I was sudde nly at the door of the restaurant after what I tho ught might have been onl y two or three steps. I kne w that I coul d swallow food because I had drunk water in my apartment. I also kne w that I coul d talk because I had cleared my throat and cursed while the water ran on me. I walked into the restaurant as I had always done . I sat at the count er and a waitress who kne w me came to me. \"You don' t look too go od toda y, dear,\" she said. \"Do you have the flu?\" \"No,\" I replied, trying to sound cheerful. \"I've been working too hard."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 284 I've been up for twenty - four hou rs straight writing a paper for a class.

When she went away to fill m y order, anot her wave of hor ror floode d my mind: Had it been onl y an illusion that I had jum ped into that abys s in Mexico, at twilight the previous day? But even if the jum p had been onl y an illusion, how coul d I have returned to L.A. from such a remote pl ace onl y ten hour s later? Had I slept for ten hour s? Or was it that it had taken ten hour s for me to fly, slide, float, or whatever to Los Ange les? To have traveled by conve ntiona l means to Los Ange les from the place where I had jum ped into the abys s was o ut of the que stion, since it woul d have taken two days just to travel to Mexico City from the place where 1 had jum ped.

I had really died, one way or anot her, at the bot tom of that gul ly. It was impos sible to com pre hend my being alive, having breakfast at Ship's. It was impos sible for me to look back into my past and see the uni nterrupt ed line of cont inuous events that all of us see when we look into the past. The onl y expl anation available to me was that I had follow ed don Juan's directives; I had move d my assemblage poi nt to a pos i tion th at prevented my death, and from my inner silence I had made the return jour ney to L.A.

Vivid though ts began to emerge in my mi nd. They had the uni que qua lity of clarifying issues. The first one that erupt ed had to do with som ething that had plague d me all along. Don Juan had described it as a com mon occurrence among male sorcerers: my incapacity to remember events that had transp ired while I was in states of height ened awareness. Don Juan had expl ained height ened awareness as a minut e dis - placement of my assemblage poi nt, which he achieved, every time I saw him, by actually pus hing forcefully on my back. He helped me, with such di splacements, to enga ge energy fields that were ordinarily periphe ral to my awareness.

While I sat at Ship 's that morning, everything that had hap pened to me in height ened awareness, to the most minut e detail, in all the years with don Juan became again a cont inuous memory without interrup tion. Don Juan had lamented that a male sor cerer who is the nagua l per force had to be fragm ented because of the bul k of his energetic mass. He said that each fragm ent lived a specific range of a total scope of activity, and the events that he expe rienced in each fragm ent had to be joined som eday to give a com plete, cons cious picture of everything that had taken place in his total life. Looki ng into my eyes, he had told me that that uni fication takes years to accom plish, and that he had been told of cases of nagua ls who never reached the total scope of their activities in a co nscious manne r and lived fragm ented. What I expe rienced that morning at Ship's was beyond any thing I coul d have imagined in my wildest fantasies. Don Juan had said to me time after time that the world of sorcerers was not an immutable world, where the wor d is final, unc hangi ng, but that it's a world of eternal fluctuation where not hing shoul d be taken for granted.

In Ship's, I integrated all the fragm ents of my being. I had acted in each one of them with perfect certainty and cons istency, and yet 1 had had no idea that 1 had done that.

How coul d I have been fragm ented in such a fashion? Who are we really? Certainly not the peopl e all of us have been led to believe we are. I had memo ries of events that had never happe ned, as far as som e core of myself was conc erned.
