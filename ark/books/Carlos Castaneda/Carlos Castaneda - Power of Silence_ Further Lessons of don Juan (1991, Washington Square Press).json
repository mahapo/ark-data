In a sense, my books are the account of an on-going process which becomesmore clear to me as time goes by.It took years of training to teach you and I to deal intelligently with theworld of everyday life. Our schooling- whether in plain reasoning or formaltopics- is rigorous because the knowledge imparted to us is very complex.The same criteria apply to the seers' world. Their schooling which relies onoral instruction and the manipulation of awareness, although different fromours, is just as rigorous because their knowledge is as, or perhaps more,complex. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"IntroductionAt various times don Juan attempted to name his knowledge for my benefit. Hefelt that the most appropriate name was 'nagualism', but that the term was tooobscure. Calling it simply 'knowledge' made it too vague, and to call it'witchcraft' was debasing. 'The mastery of intent' was too abstract, and 'thesearch for total freedom' too long and metaphorical. Finally, because he wasunable to find a more appropriate name, he called it 'sorcery', although headmitted it was not nearly accurate.Over the years, he had given me different definitions of sorcery, but he hadalways maintained that definitions change as knowledge increases. Toward the endof my apprenticeship, I felt I was in a position to appreciate a clearerdefinition. So I asked him once more. \"From where the average man (or woman) stands,\" don Juan said, \"sorcery isnonsense; an ominous mystery beyond his reach. And he is right, not because thisis an absolute fact, but because the average man lacks the energy to deal withsorcery.\"He stopped for a moment before he continued. \"Human beings are born,\" don Juansaid, \"with a finite amount of energy; an energy that is systematicallydeployed, beginning at the moment of birth, in order that it may be used mostadvantageously by the modality of the time.\"\"What do you mean by the modality of the time?\" I asked.\"The modality of the time is the precise bundle of energy fields beingperceived,\" he answered.\"I believe man's perception has changed through the ages. The actual timedecides the mode. The time decides which precise bundle of energy fields are tobe used; out of an incalculable number.\"Handling the modality of the time- those select few energy fields- takes allour available energy; and thus leaves us no extra energy that would help us useany of the other energy fields.\"He urged me with a subtle movement of his eyebrows to consider all this.\"This is what I mean,\" he went on, \"when I say that the average man lacks theenergy needed to deal with sorcery. If he uses only the energy he has, he can'tperceive the worlds sorcerers do.\"To perceive sorcery worlds, sorcerers need to use a cluster of energy fieldsnot ordinarily used.\"Naturally, if the average man is to perceive sorcery worlds and understandsorcerers' perception, he must use the same energy cluster sorcerers have used.And this is just not possible, because all of the average man's energy isalready deployed on the cluster of the times.\"He paused as if searching for the appropriate words to make his point.\"Think of it this way,\" he proceeded. \"It isn't that as time goes by you'relearning sorcery. Rather, what you're learning is to save energy. This energywill enable you to handle some of the energy fields which are inaccessible toyou now.\"Sorcery, properly speaking, is simply the ability to use energy fields that arenot employed in perceiving the ordinary world we know. Sorcery is a state ofawareness and the ability to perceive something which ordinary perceptioncannot.\"Everything I've put you through,\" don Juan went on, \"and each of the thingsI've shown you was only a device to convince you that there's more to us thanmeets the eye.We don't need anyone to teach us sorcery because there is really nothing tolearn. What we need is a teacher to convince us that there is incalculable powerat our fingertips. What a strange paradox!\"Every warrior on the path of knowledge thinks, at one time or another, that he(or she) is learning sorcery. However, all he's really doing is allowing himselfto be convinced of the power hidden in his being, and that he can reach it.\"\"Is that what you're doing, don Juan- convincing me?\"\"Exactly. I'm trying to convince you that you can reach that power.\"I went through the same thing, and I was as hard to convince as you are.\"\"Once we have reached it,\" I asked, \"what exactly do we do with it, don Juan?\"\"Nothing. Once we have reached that understanding, it will by itself make use ofenergy fields which are available to us but were inaccessible.\"Access to formerly unavailable energy fields, as I have said, is sorcery in anut shell.\"But then we begin to 'see', that is, to perceive something else; not asimagination, but as real and concrete. And then we begin to know without havingto use words. And what any of us does with that increased perception and withthat silent knowledge depends on our own temperament.\" On another occasion, he gave me another kind of explanation. We were discussingan unrelated topic when he abruptly changed the subject and began to tell me ajoke. He laughed and very gently patted my back between the shoulder blades; asif he were shy and it was too forward of him to touch me. He chuckled at mynervous reaction.\"You're skittish,\" he said teasingly, and slapped my back with greater force.My ears buzzed. For an instant I lost my breath. It felt as though he had hurtmy lungs. Every breath brought me great discomfort. Yet, after I had coughed andchoked a few times, my nasal passages opened and I found myself taking deep,soothing breaths.I had such a feeling of well-being that I was not even annoyed at him for hisblow; which had been as hard as it was unexpected.Then don Juan began a most remarkable explanation. Clearly and concisely, hegave me a different and more precise definition of sorcery.I had entered into a wondrous state of awareness! I had such clarity of mindthat I was able to comprehend and assimilate everything don Juan was saying.He said that in the universe there is an unmeasurable, indescribable force whichsorcerers call intent, and that absolutely everything that exists in the entirecosmos is attached to intent by a connecting link. Sorcerers, or warriors, as hecalled them, were concerned with discussing, understanding, and employing thatconnecting link.They were especially concerned with cleaning it of the numbing effects broughtabout by the ordinary concerns of their everyday lives. Sorcery at this levelcould be defined as the procedure of cleaning one's connecting link to intent.Don Juan stressed that this 'cleaning procedure' was extremely difficult tounderstand, or to learn to perform.Sorcerers, therefore, divided their instruction into two categories.One was instruction for the everyday-life state of awareness, in which thecleaning process was presented in a disguised fashion.The other was instruction for the states of heightened awareness, such as theone I was presently experiencing, in which sorcerers obtained knowledge directlyfrom intent, without the distracting intervention of spoken language.Don Juan explained that by using heightened awareness over thousands of years ofpainful struggle, sorcerers had gained specific insights into intent. Theypassed these nuggets of direct knowledge on from generation to generation to thepresent. He said that the task of sorcery is to take this seeminglyincomprehensible knowledge and make it understandable by the standards ofawareness of everyday life.Then he explained the role of the guide in the lives of sorcerers. He said thata guide is called 'the nagual', and is a man or a woman with extraordinaryenergy; a teacher who has sobriety, endurance, and stability; someone seers seeas a luminous sphere having four compartments as if four luminous balls havebeen compressed together.Because of their extraordinary energy, naguals are intermediaries. Their energyallows them to channel peace, harmony, laughter, and knowledge directly from thesource- from intent- and transmit intent to their companions.Naguals are responsible for supplying what sorcerers call 'the minimal chance';the awareness of one's connection with intent.I could understand everything on Juan was saying about his world easily, and yethe had described the process of understanding as very difficult.I told him that my mind was grasping everything he was telling me, but that theonly part of his explanation still unclear to me was why two sets of teachingswere needed.\"You will need a lifetime to remember the insights you've had today,\" he said,\"because most of them were silent knowledge. A few moments from now you willhave forgotten them. That's one of the unfathomable mysteries of awareness.\"Don Juan then made me shift levels of consciousness by striking me on my leftside, at the edge of my ribcage.Instantly I lost my extraordinary clarity of mind and could not remember havingever had it... Don Juan himself set me the task of writing about the premises of sorcery. Once,very casually in the early stages of my apprenticeship, he suggested that Iwrite a book in order to make use of the notes I had always taken.I had accumulated reams of notes and never considered what to do with them. Iargued that the suggestion was absurd because I was not a writer.\"Of course, you're not a writer,\" he said, \"so you will have to use sorcery.First, you must visualize your experiences as if you were reliving them, andthen you must see the text in your dreaming. For you, writing should not be aliterary exercise, but rather an exercise in sorcery.\"I have written in that manner about the premises of sorcery just as don Juanexplained them to me within the context of his teaching.In his teaching scheme, which was developed by sorcerers of ancient times, therewere two categories of instruction.One was called \"teachings for the right side,\" and was carried out in theapprentice's ordinary state of awareness.The other was called \"teachings for the left side\", and was put into practicesolely while the apprentice was in states of heightened awareness.These two categories allowed teachers to school their apprentices toward threeareas of expertise: the mastery of awareness, the art of stalking, and themastery of intent.These three areas of expertise are the three riddles sorcerers encounter intheir search for knowledge. The mastery of awareness is the riddle of the mind; the perplexity sorcerersexperience when they recognize the astounding mystery and scope of awareness andperception.The art of stalking is the riddle of the heart; the puzzlement sorcerers feelupon becoming aware of two things: first that the world appears to us to beunalterably objective and factual because of the peculiarities of our awarenessand perception; and second, that if different peculiarities of perception comeinto play, the very things about the world that seem so unalterably objectiveand factual change.The mastery of intent is the riddle of the spirit; the paradox of the abstract;sorcerers' thoughts and actions projected beyond our human condition. Don Juan's instructions on both the art of stalking and the mastery of intentdepended upon his instruction on the mastery of awareness.The mastery of awareness was the cornerstone of his teachings, and consists ofthe following basic premises: 1. The universe is an infinite mass of energy fields resembling threads oflight.2. These energy fields, called the Eagle's emanations, radiate from a source ofinconceivable proportions metaphorically called The Eagle.3. Human beings are composed of an incalculable number of the Eagle's emanationsin an encased mass. Seers perceive this mass as a ball of light, like a giantluminous egg, the size of the person's body with the arms extended laterally.4. Only a very small group of the emanations inside this luminous egg are lit upby a point of intense brilliance located near the egg's surface. This point iswhere perception is assembled; 'the assemblage point'.5. Perception occurs when the emanations lit by the assemblage point extendtheir light to illuminate identical matching emanations outside the egg. Onlythe emanations lit by the assemblage point are perceived.6. The assemblage point can move from its usual position to another on thesurface or into the interior. It then lights up a new group of emanations makingthem perceivable and cancelling the former perceptions.7. When the assemblage point shifts far enough, it makes possible the perceptionof an entirely different world as objective and factual as the one we normallyperceive. Sorcerers go into those other worlds to get energy, power, solutionsto general and particular problems, or to face the unimaginable.8. Intent is the pervasive force that causes us to perceive. We do not becomeaware because we perceive; rather, we perceive as a result of the pressure andintrusion of intent.9. The aim of the new seers is to reach a state of total awareness in order toexperience all the possibilities of perception available to man. This state ofawareness even implies an alternative way of dying. A level of practical knowledge was included as part of teaching the mastery ofawareness. On that practical level don Juan taught the procedures necessary tomove the assemblage point. The two great systems devised by the sorcerer seersof ancient times to accomplish this were: dreaming, the control and utilizationof dreams; and stalking, the control of behavior.Moving one's own assemblage point was an essential maneuver that every sorcererhad to learn.The naguals, also learned to move it for others. The naguals dislodge others'assemblage point from its customary position by pushing it. This push isexperienced as a smack on the right shoulder blade- although the body is nevertouched- and results in a state of heightened awareness.In compliance with his tradition, it was exclusively in these states ofheightened awareness that don Juan carried out the most important and dramaticpart of his teachings: the instructions for the left side.Because of the extraordinary quality of these states, don Juan demanded that Inot discuss them with others until we had concluded everything in the sorcerers'teaching scheme. That demand was not difficult for me to accept.In those unique states of awareness my capabilities for understanding theinstruction were unbelievably enhanced, but at the same time my capabilities fordescribing or even remembering them were impaired.I could function in those states with proficiency and assuredness, but I couldnot recollect anything about them once I returned to my normal consciousness.It took me years to be able to make the crucial conversion of my enhancedawareness into plain memory. My reason and common sense delayed this momentbecause they were colliding head-on with the preposterous, unthinkable realityof heightened awareness and direct knowledge. For years the resulting cognitivedisarrangement forced me to avoid the issue by not thinking about it. Whatever I have published about my sorcery apprenticeship, up to now, has been arecounting of how don Juan taught me the mastery of awareness. I have not yetdescribed the art of stalking or the mastery of intent.Don Juan taught me their principles and applications with the help of two of hissorcerer companions, Vicente Medrano, and Silvio Manuel. But whatever I learnedfrom them still remains clouded in what Don Juan called the intricacies ofheightened awareness.Until now it had been impossible for me to write or even to think coherentlyabout the art of stalking and the mastery of intent. My mistake has been toregard them as subjects for normal memory and recollection. They are, but at thesame time they are not. In order to resolve this contradiction, I have notpursued the subjects directly- a virtual impossibility- but have dealt with themindirectly through the concluding topic of don Juan's instruction: the storiesof the sorcerers of the past.He recounted these stories to make evident what he called the abstract cores ofhis lessons.His way of talking made me believe for many years that his explanations of theabstract cores were like academic dissertations. I was, however, intellectuallyincapable of grasping the nature of the abstract cores despite his comprehensiveexplanations. All I was able to do under these circumstances was to take hisexplanations as given.And even without a thorough rational assessment which I believed was essentialto understanding them, the abstract cores became part of my tacit acceptance andunderstanding of his teachings.I know now that the stories of the sorcerers of the past, were intended more toopen my mind than to explain anything in a rational manner.Don Juan presented three sets of six abstract cores each, arranged in anincreasing level of complexity. I have dealt here with the first set, which is composed of the following: themanifestations of the spirit, the knock of the spirit, the trickery of thespirit, the descent of the spirit, the requirements of intent, and handlingintent. ================================================================ Part 1. The Manifestations of the Spirit"},{"pageContent":"The First Abstract CoreDon Juan, whenever it was pertinent, used to tell me brief stories about thesorcerers of his lineage, especially his teacher, the nagual Julian. They werenot really stories, but rather descriptions of the way those sorcerers behaved,and of aspects of their personalities. These accounts were each designed to shedlight on a specific topic in my apprenticeship.I had heard the same stories from the other fifteen members of don Juan's groupof sorcerers, but none of these accounts had been able to give me a clearpicture of the people they described. Since I had no way of persuading don Juanto give me more details about those sorcerers, I had resigned myself to the ideaof never knowing about them in any depth.One afternoon, in the mountains of southern Mexico, don Juan, after havingexplained to me more about the intricacies of the mastery of awareness, made astatement that completely baffled me.\"I think it's time for us to talk about the sorcerers of our past,\" he said.Don Juan explained that it was necessary that I begin drawing conclusions basedon a systematic view of the past; conclusions about both the world of dailyaffairs and the sorcerers' world.\"Sorcerers,\" he said, \"are vitally concerned with their past. But I don't meantheir personal past. For sorcerers, their past is what other sorcerers in bygonedays have done. And what we are now going to do is examine that past.\"The average man also examines the past. But it's mostly his personal past heexamines; and he does so for personal reasons.Sorcerers do quite the opposite; they consult their past in order to obtain apoint of reference.\"\"But,\" I asked, \"Isn't that what everyone does? Look at the past to get a pointof reference?\"\"No!\" he answered emphatically. \"The average man measures himself against thepast, whether his personal past or the past knowledge of his time in order tofind justifications for his present or future behavior; or to establish a modelfor himself.\"Only sorcerers genuinely seek a point of reference in their past.\"\"Perhaps, don Juan, things would be clear to me if you tell me what a point ofreference for a sorcerer is.\"\"For sorcerers,\" he replied, \"establishing a point of reference means getting achance to examine intent; which is exactly the aim of this final topic ofinstruction. And nothing can give sorcerers a better view of intent thanexamining stories of other sorcerers battling to understand the same force.\"He explained that as they examined their past, the sorcerers of his lineage tookcareful notice of the basic abstract order of their knowledge.\"In sorcery there are twenty-one abstract cores,\" don Juan went on. \"And then,based on those abstract cores, there are scores of sorcery stories about thenaguals of our lineage battling to understand the spirit. It's time to tell youthe abstract cores and the sorcery stories.\"I waited for don Juan to begin telling me the stories, but he changed thesubject and went back to explaining awareness.\"Wait a minute,\" I protested. \"What about the sorcery stories? Aren't you goingto tell them to me?\"\"Of course I am,\" he said. \"But they are not stories that one can tell as ifthey were tales. You've got to think your way through them and then rethinkthem; relive them, so to speak.\"There was a long silence. I became very cautious and was afraid that if Ipersisted in asking him again to tell me the stories, I could be committingmyself to something I might later regret. But my curiosity was greater than mygood sense.\"Well, let's get on with them,\" I croaked.Don Juan, obviously catching the gist of my thoughts, smiled maliciously.He stood and signaled me to follow. We had been sitting on some dry rocks at thebottom of a gully. It was mid-afternoon. The sky was dark and cloudy. Low,almost black rain clouds hovered above the peaks to the east. In comparison, thehigh clouds made the sky seem clear to the south. Earlier it had rained heavily,but then the rain seemed to have retreated to a hiding place, leaving behindonly a threat.I should have been chilled to the bone because it was very cold, but I was warm.As I clutched a rock don Juan had given me to hold, I realized that thissensation of being warm in nearly freezing weather was familiar to me, yet itamazed me every time. Whenever I seemed about to freeze, don Juan would give mea branch to hold, or a stone, or he would put a bunch of leaves under my shirton the tip of my sternum; and that would be sufficient to raise my bodytemperature.I had tried unsuccessfully to recreate by myself the effect of hisministrations. [* ministration- assistance in time of difficulty] He told me itwas not the ministrations that kept me warm, but rather his inner silence. Thebranches or stones or leaves were merely devices to trap my attention andmaintain it in focus.Moving quickly, we climbed the steep west side of a mountain until we reached arock ledge at the very top. We were in the foothills of a higher range ofmountains. From the rock ledge, I could see that fog had begun to move onto thesouth end of the valley floor below us. Low, wispy clouds seemed to be closingin on us too, sliding down from the black-green, high mountain peaks to thewest. After the rain, under the dark cloudy sky, the valley and the mountains tothe east and south appeared covered in a mantle of black-green silence.\"This is the ideal place to have a talk,\" don Juan said, sitting on the rockfloor of a concealed shallow cave.The cave was perfect for the two of us to sit side by side. Our heads werenearly touching the roof and our backs fitted snugly against the curved surfaceof the rock wall. It was as if the cave had been carved deliberately toaccommodate two persons of our size.I noticed another strange feature of the cave: When I stood on the ledge, Icould see the entire valley and the mountain ranges to the east and south; butwhen I sat down, I was boxed in by the rocks. Yet the ledge was at the level ofthe cave floor, and flat.I was about to point this strange effect out to don Juan, but he anticipated me.\"This cave is man-made,\" he said. \"The ledge is slanted but the eye doesn'tregister the incline.\"\"Who made this cave, don Juan?\"\"The ancient sorcerers; perhaps thousands of years ago. And one of thepeculiarities of this cave is that animals and insects and even people stay awayfrom it. The ancient sorcerers seem to have infused it with an ominous chargethat makes every living thing feel ill at ease.\"But strangely, I felt irrationally secure and happy there. A sensation ofphysical contentment made my entire body tingle. I actually felt the mostagreeable- the most delectable sensation in my stomach. It was as if my nerveswere being tickled.\"I don't feel ill at ease,\" I commented.\"Neither do I,\" he said. \"Which only means that you and I aren't that fartemperamentally from those old sorcerers of the past; something which worries meno end.\"I was afraid to pursue that subject any further, so I waited for him to talk.\"The first sorcery story I am going to tell you is called \"The Manifestations ofthe Spirit\",\" don Juan began, \"but don't let the title mystify you. Themanifestations [* manifestation- a clear appearance, as of a disembodied spiritexpressed without words] of the spirit is only the first abstract core aroundwhich the first sorcery story is built.\"That first abstract core is a story in itself,\" he went on. \"The story saysthat once upon a time there was a man; an average man without any specialattributes. He was, like everyone else, a conduit for the spirit. And by virtueof that, like everyone else, he was part of the spirit; part of the abstract.But he didn't know it. The world kept him so busy that he had neither the timenor the inclination really to examine the matter.\"The spirit tried, uselessly, to reveal their connection. Using an inner voicethe spirit disclosed its secrets, but the man was incapable of understanding therevelations. Naturally, he heard the inner voice, but he believed it to be hisown feelings he was feeling and his own thoughts he was thinking.\"The spirit, in order to shake him out of his slumber, gave him three signs;three successive manifestations. The spirit physically crossed the man's path inthe most obvious manner. But the man was oblivious to anything but hisself-concern.\"Don Juan stopped and looked at me as he did whenever he was waiting for mycomments and questions. I had nothing to say. I did not understand the point hewas trying to make.\"I've just told you the first abstract core,\" he continued. \"The spirit, inorder to shake him out of his slumber, gave him three signs; three successivemanifestations. The spirit physically crossed the man's path in the most obviousmanner. But the man was oblivious to anything but his self-concern. And trickerybecame the essence of the sorcerers' path. But that is another story.\"Don Juan explained that sorcerers understood this abstract core to be ablueprint for events, or a recurrent pattern that appeared every time intent wasgiving an indication of something meaningful. Abstract cores, then, wereblueprints of complete chains of events.He assured me that by means beyond comprehension, every detail of every abstractcore has re-occurred to every apprentice nagual. He further assured me that hehad helped intent to involve me in all the abstract cores of sorcery in the samemanner that his benefactor, the nagual Julian, and all the naguals before himhad involved their apprentices. The process by which each apprentice nagualencountered the abstract cores created a series of accounts woven around thoseabstract cores; incorporating the particular details of each apprentice'spersonality and circumstances.He said, for example, that I had my own story about the manifestations of thespirit: He had his: His benefactor had his own: So had the nagual that precededhim, and so on, and so forth.\"What is my story about the manifestations of the spirit?\" I asked, somewhatmystified.\"If any warrior is aware of his stories, it's you,\" he replied. \"After all,you've been writing about them for years. But you didn't notice the abstractcores because you are a practical man. You do everything only for the purpose ofenhancing your practicality. Although you handled your stories to exhaustion youhad no idea that there was an abstract core in them.Everything I've done appears to you, therefore, as an often-whimsical practicalactivity; teaching sorcery to a reluctant and, most of the time, stupid,apprentice. As long as you see it in those terms, the abstract cores will eludeyou.\"\"You must forgive me, don Juan,\" I said, \"but your statements are veryconfusing. What are you saying?\"\"I'm trying to introduce the sorcery stories as a subject,\" he replied. \"I'venever talked to you specifically about this topic because traditionally it'sleft hidden. It is the spirit's last artifice. [* artifice- a deceptivemanoeuvre (especially to avoid capture)] It is said that when the apprenticeunderstands the abstract cores, it's like the placing of the stone that caps andseals a pyramid.\"It was getting dark and it looked as though it was about to rain again. Iworried that if the wind blew from east to west while it was raining, we weregoing to get soaked in that cave. I was sure don Juan was aware of that, but heseemed to ignore it.\"It won't rain again until tomorrow morning,\" he said.Hearing my inner thoughts being answered made me jump involuntarily and hit thetop of my head on the cave roof. It was a thud that sounded worse than it felt.Don Juan held his sides laughing. After a while my head really began to hurt andI had to massage it.\"Your company is as enjoyable to me as mine must have been to my benefactor,\" hesaid and began to laugh again.We were quiet for a few minutes. The silence around me was ominous. [* ominous-threatening or foreshadowing evil or tragic developments] I fancied that I couldhear the rustling of the low clouds as they descended on us from the highermountains. Then I realized that what I was hearing was the soft wind. From myposition in the shallow cave, it sounded like the whispering of human voices.\"I had the incredible good luck to be taught by two naguals,\" don Juan said andbroke the mesmeric grip the wind had on me at that moment. \"One was, of course,my benefactor, the nagual Julian, and the other was his benefactor, the nagualElias. My case was unique.\"\"Why was your case unique?\" I asked.\"Because for generations,\" he explained, \"naguals have gathered theirapprentices years after their own teachers have left the world- except mybenefactor.\"I became the nagual Julian's apprentice eight years before his benefactor leftthe world. I had eight years' grace. It was the luckiest thing that could havehappened to me because I had the opportunity to be taught by two oppositetemperaments. It was like being reared by a powerful father and an even morepowerful grandfather who don't see eye to eye. In such a contest, thegrandfather always wins.\"So I'm properly the product of the nagual Elias's teachings. I was closer tohim not only in temperament, but also in looks. I'd say that I owe him my finetuning. However, the bulk of the work that went into turning me from a miserablebeing into an impeccable warrior I owe to my benefactor, the nagual Julian.\"\"What was the nagual Julian like physically?\" I asked.\"Do you know that to this day it's hard for me to visualize him?\" don Juan said.\"I know that sounds absurd, but depending on his needs or the circumstances, hecould be either young or old, handsome or homely, effete [* effete- marked byexcessive self-indulgence and moral decay] and weak, or strong and virile, [*virile- characterized by energy and vigour] fat or slender, of medium height orextremely short.\"\"Do you mean he was an actor acting out different roles with the aid of props?\"\"No, there were no props involved, and he was not merely an actor. He was, ofcourse, a great actor in his own right, but that is different. The point is thathe was capable of transforming himself and becoming all those diametricallyopposed persons. Being a great actor enabled him to portray all the minutepeculiarities of behavior that made each specific being real. Let us say that hewas at ease in every change of being. As you are at ease in every change ofclothes.\"Eagerly, I asked don Juan to tell me more about his benefactor'stransformations. He said that someone taught him how to elicit thosetransformations, but that to explain any further would force him to overlap intodifferent stories.\"What did the nagual Julian look like when he wasn't transforming himself?\" Iasked.\"Let's say that before he became a nagual, he was very slim and muscular,\" donJuan said. \"His hair was black, thick, and wavy. He had a long, fine nose,strong big white teeth, an oval face, strong jaw, and shiny dark-brown eyes. Hewas about five feet eight inches tall. He was not Indian or even a brownMexican, but he was not Anglo white either. In fact, his complexion seemed to belike no one else's, especially in his later years when his ever-changingcomplexion shifted constantly from dark to very light and back again to dark.When I first met him he was a light-brown old man, then as time went by, hebecame a light-skinned young man, perhaps only a few years older than me. I wastwenty at that time.\"But if the changes of his outer appearance were astonishing,\" don Juan went on,\"the changes of mood and behavior that accompanied each transformation were evenmore astonishing. For example, when he was a fat young man, he was jolly andsensual. When he was a skinny old man, he was petty and vindictive. When he wasa fat old man, he was the greatest imbecile there was.\"\"Was he ever himself?\" I asked.He replied, \"Not the way I am myself. Since I'm not interested intransformation, I am always the same. But he was not like me at all.\" Don Juanlooked at me as if he were assessing my inner strength. He smiled, shook hishead from side to side and broke into a belly laugh.\"What's so funny, don Juan?\" I asked.\"The fact is that you're still too prudish and stiff to appreciate fully thenature of my benefactor's transformations and their total scope,\" he said. \"Ionly hope that when I tell you about them you don't become morbidly obsessed.\"For some reason, I suddenly became quite uncomfortable, and had to change thesubject.\"Why are the naguals called 'benefactors' and not simply teachers?\" I askednervously.\"Calling a nagual a benefactor is a gesture his apprentices make,\" don Juansaid. \"A nagual creates an overwhelming feeling of gratitude in his disciples.After all, a nagual molds them and guides them through unimaginable areas.\"I remarked that to teach was in my opinion the greatest, most altruistic actanyone could perform for another.\"For you, teaching is talking about patterns,\" he said. \"For a sorcerer, toteach is what a nagual does for his apprentices. For them, he taps theprevailing force in the universe: intent- the force that changes and reordersthings or keeps them as they are.\"The nagual formulates; then guides the consequences that that force can have onhis disciples. Without the nagual's molding intent, there would be no awe; nowonder for them. And his apprentices, instead of embarking on a magical journeyof discovery, would only be learning a trade: healer, sorcerer, diviner,charlatan, or whatever.\"\"Can you explain intent to me?\" I asked.\"The only way to know intent\" he replied, \"is to know it directly through aliving connection that exists between intent and all sentient beings. Sorcererscall intent the indescribable, the spirit, the abstract, or the nagual. I wouldprefer to call it nagual, but it overlaps with the name for the leader- thebenefactor- who is also called nagual. So I have opted for calling it thespirit, intent, or the abstract.\"Don Juan stopped abruptly and recommended that I keep quiet and think about whathe had told me. By then it was very dark. The silence was so profound thatinstead of lulling me into a restful state, it agitated me. I could not maintainorder in my thoughts. I tried to focus my attention on the story he had told me,but instead I thought of everything else until finally I fell asleep. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Impeccability of the Nagual ElÃ­asI had no way of telling how long I slept in that cave. Don Juan's voice startledme and I awoke. He was saying that the first sorcery story concerning themanifestations of the spirit was an account of the relationship between intentand the nagual. It was the story of how the spirit set up a lure for the nagual,a prospective disciple, and of how the nagual had to evaluate the lure beforemaking his decision either to accept or reject it.It was very dark in the cave, and the small space was confining. Ordinarily anarea of that size would have made me claustrophobic, but the cave kept soothingme; dispelling my feelings of annoyance. Also, something in the configuration ofthe cave absorbed the echoes of don Juan's words.Don Juan explained that every act performed by sorcerers, especially by thenaguals, was either performed as a way to strengthen their link with intent oras a response triggered by the link itself. Sorcerers, and specifically thenaguals, therefore had to be actively and permanently on the lookout formanifestations of the spirit. Such manifestations were called gestures of thespirit or, more simply, indications or omens.He repeated a story he had already told me; the story of how he had met hisbenefactor, the nagual Julian.Don Juan had been cajoled by two crooked men to take a job on an isolatedhacienda. One of the men, the foreman of the hacienda, simply took possession ofdon Juan and in effect made him a slave.Desperate and with no other course of action, don Juan escaped. The violentforeman chased him and caught him on a country road where he shot don Juan inthe chest and left him for dead.Don Juan was lying unconscious in the road bleeding to death when the nagualJulian came along. Using his healer's knowledge, he stopped the bleeding, tookdon Juan- who was still unconscious- to his home, and cured him.The indications the spirit gave the nagual Julian about don Juan were, first, asmall cyclone that lifted a cone of dust on the road a couple of yards fromwhere he lay.The second omen was the thought which had crossed the nagual Julian's mind aninstant before he had heard the report of the gun a few yards away: that it wastime to have an apprentice nagual.Moments later, the spirit gave him the third omen, when he ran to take cover. Hecollided with the gunman putting him to flight; perhaps preventing the foremanfrom shooting don Juan a second time. A collision with someone was the type ofblunder which no sorcerer, much less a nagual, should ever make.The nagual Julian immediately evaluated the opportunity. When he saw don Juan,he understood the reason for the spirit's manifestation: Here was a double man;a perfect candidate to be his apprentice nagual.This brought up a nagging rational concern for me. I wanted to know if sorcererscould interpret an omen erroneously.Don Juan replied that although my question sounded perfectly legitimate, it wasinapplicable, like the majority of my questions, because I asked them based onmy experiences in the world of everyday life. Thus they were always about testedprocedures, steps to be followed, and rules of meticulousness; but had nothingto do with the premises of sorcery. He pointed out that the flaw in my reasoningwas that I always failed to include my experiences in the sorcerers' world.I argued that very few of my experiences in the sorcerers' world had continuity,and therefore I could not make use of those experiences in my present day-to-daylife. Very few times, and only when I was in states of profound heightenedawareness, had I remembered everything. At the level of heightened awareness Iusually reached, the only experience that had continuity between past andpresent was that of knowing him.He responded cuttingly that I was perfectly capable of engaging in sorcerers'reasonings because I had experienced the sorcery premises in my normal state ofawareness. In a more mellow tone he added that heightened awareness did notreveal everything until the whole edifice [* edifice- a structure that standsmore or less permanently in one place] of sorcery knowledge was completed.Then he answered my question about whether or not sorcerers could misinterpretomens. He explained that when a sorcerer interpreted an omen, he knew its exactmeaning without having any notion of how he knew it. This was one of thebewildering effects of the connecting link with intent. Sorcerers had a sense ofknowing things directly. How sure they were depended on the strength and clarityof their connecting link.He said that the feeling everyone knows as 'intuition' is the activation of ourlink with intent. And since sorcerers deliberately pursue the understanding andstrengthening of that link, it could be said that they intuit everythingunerringly and accurately. Reading omens is commonplace for sorcerers. Mistakeshappen only when personal feelings intervene and cloud the sorcerers' connectinglink with intent. Otherwise their direct knowledge is totally accurate andfunctional.We remained quiet for a while. All of a sudden he said, \"I am going to tell you a story about the nagual Eliasand the manifestation of the spirit. The spirit manifests itself to a sorcerer,especially to a nagual, at every turn. However, this is not the entire truth.The entire truth is that the spirit reveals itself to everyone with the sameintensity and consistency, but only sorcerers, and naguals in particular, areattuned to such revelations.\"Don Juan began his story. He said that the nagual Elias had been riding hishorse to the city one day, taking himself through a shortcut by some cornfields,when suddenly his horse shied- frightened by the low, fast sweep of a falconthat missed the nagual's straw hat by only a few inches.\"The nagual immediately dismounted and began to look around. He saw a strangeyoung man among the tall, dry cornstalks. The man was dressed in an expensivedark suit and appeared alien there. The nagual Elias was used to the sight ofpeasants or landowners in the fields, but he had never seen an elegantly dressedcity man moving through the fields with apparent disregard for his expensiveshoes and clothes.The nagual tethered his horse and walked toward the young man. He recognized theflight of the falcon, as well as the man's apparel, as obvious manifestations ofthe spirit which he could not disregard. He got very close to the young man andsaw what was going on. The man was chasing a peasant woman who was running a fewyards ahead of him, dodging and laughing with him.The contradiction was quite apparent to the nagual. The two people cavorting inthe cornfield did not belong together. The nagual thought that the man must bethe landowner's son and the woman a servant in the house. He felt embarrassed tobe observing them, and was about to turn and leave when the falcon again sweptover the cornfield and this time brushed the young man's head. The falconalarmed the couple and they stopped and looked up, trying to anticipate anothersweep. The nagual noticed that the man was thin and handsome, and had haunting,restless eyes.Then the couple became bored watching for the falcon, and returned to theirplay. The man caught the woman, embraced her and gently laid her on the ground.But instead of trying to make love to her, as the nagual assumed he would donext, he removed his own clothes and paraded naked in front of the woman.She did not shyly close her eyes or scream with embarrassment or fright. Shegiggled, mesmerized by the prancing naked man, who moved around her like asatyr, making lewd gestures and laughing. Finally, apparently overpowered by thesight, she uttered a wild cry, rose, and threw herself into the young man'sarms.Don Juan said that the nagual Elias confessed to him that the indications of thespirit on that occasion had been most baffling. It was clearly evident that theman was insane. Otherwise, knowing how protective peasants were of their women,he would not have considered seducing a young peasant woman in broad daylight afew yards from the road and naked to boot.Don Juan broke into a laugh and told me that in those days to take off one'sclothes and engage in a sexual act in broad daylight in such a place meant onehad to be either insane or blessed by the spirit. He added that what the man haddone might not seem remarkable nowadays. But back then, nearly a hundred yearsago, people were infinitely more inhibited.All of this convinced the nagual Elias from the moment he laid eyes on the manthat he was both insane and blessed by the spirit. He worried that peasantsmight happen by, become enraged and lynch the man on the spot. But no one did.It felt to the nagual as if time had been suspended.When the man finished making love, he put on his clothes, took out ahandkerchief, meticulously dusted his shoes and, all the while making wildpromises to the girl, went on his way. The nagual Elias followed him. In fact,he followed him for several days and found out that his name was Julian and thathe was an actor.Subsequently the nagual saw him on the stage often enough to realize that theactor had a great deal of charisma. The audience, especially the women, lovedhim. And he had no scruples about making use of his charismatic gifts to seducefemale admirers. As the nagual followed the actor, he was able to witness hisseduction technique more than once. It entailed showing himself naked to hisadoring fans as soon as he got them alone, then waiting until the women, stunnedby his display, surrendered. The technique seemed extremely effective for him.The nagual had to admit that the actor was a great success, except on one count.He was mortally ill. The nagual had seen the black shadow of death that followedhim everywhere.Don Juan explained again something he had told me years before- that our deathwas a black spot right behind the left shoulder. He said that sorcerers knewwhen a person was close to dying because they could see the dark spot, whichbecame a moving shadow the exact size and shape of the person to whom itbelonged.As he recognized the imminent presence of death the nagual was plunged into anumbing perplexity. He wondered why the spirit was singling out such a sickperson. He had been taught that in a natural state replacement, not repair,prevailed. And the nagual doubted that he had the ability or the strength toheal this young man, or resist the black shadow of his death. He even doubted ifhe would be able to discover why the spirit had involved him in a display ofsuch obvious waste.The nagual could do nothing but stay with the actor, follow him around, and waitfor the opportunity to see in greater depth. Don Juan explained that a nagual'sfirst reaction, upon being faced with the manifestations of the spirit, is tosee the persons involved. The nagual Elias had been meticulous about seeing theman the moment he laid eyes on him. He had also seen the peasant woman who waspart of the spirit's manifestation, but he had seen nothing that, in hisjudgment, could have warranted the spirit's display.In the course of witnessing another seduction, however, the nagual's ability tosee took on a new depth. This time the actor's adoring fan was the daughter of arich landowner. And from the start she was in complete control. The nagual foundout about their rendezvous because he overheard her daring the actor to meet herthe next day. The nagual was hiding across the street at dawn when the youngwoman left her house, and instead of going to early mass she went to join theactor. The actor was waiting for her and she coaxed him into following her tothe open fields. He appeared to hesitate, but she taunted him and would notallow him to withdraw.As the nagual watched them sneaking away, he had an absolute conviction thatsomething was going to happen on that day which neither of the players wasanticipating. He saw that the actor's black shadow had grown to almost twice hisheight. The nagual deduced from the mysterious hard look in the young woman'seyes that she too had felt the black shadow of death at an intuitive level. Theactor seemed preoccupied. He did not laugh as he had on other occasions.They walked quite a distance. At one point, they spotted the nagual followingthem, but he instantly pretended to be working the land as a peasant whobelonged there. That made the couple relax and allowed the nagual to comecloser.Then the moment came when the actor tossed off his clothes and showed himself tothe girl. But instead of swooning and falling into his arms as his otherconquests had, this girl began to hit him. She kicked and punched himmercilessly and stepped on his bare toes, making him cry out with pain.The nagual knew the man had not threatened or harmed the young woman. He had notlaid a finger on her. She was the only one fighting. He was merely trying toparry the blows, and persistently, but without enthusiasm, trying to entice herby showing her his genitals.The nagual was filled with both revulsion and admiration. He could perceive thatthe actor was an irredeemable libertine, but he could also perceive equallyeasily that there was something unique, although revolting, about him. Itbaffled the nagual to see that the man's connecting link with the spirit wasextraordinarily clear.Finally the attack ended. The woman stopped beating the actor. But then, insteadof running away, she surrendered, lay down and told the actor he could now havehis way with her.The nagual observed that the man was so exhausted he was practicallyunconscious. Yet despite his fatigue he went right ahead and consummated hisseduction.The nagual was laughing and pondering that useless man's great stamina anddetermination when the woman screamed and the actor began to gasp. The nagualsaw how the black shadow struck the actor. It went like a dagger, with pinpointaccuracy into his gap.Don Juan made a digression at this point to elaborate on something he hadexplained before: He had described the gap, an opening in our luminous shell atthe height of the navel, where the force of death ceaselessly struck. What donJuan now explained was that when death hit healthy beings it was with aball-like blow- like the punch of a fist. But when beings were dying, deathstruck them with a dagger-like thrust.Thus the nagual Elias knew without any question that the actor was as good asdead, and his death automatically finished his own interest in the spirit'sdesigns. There were no designs left. Death had leveled everything.He rose from his hiding place and started to leave when something made himhesitate. It was the young woman's calmness. She was nonchalantly putting on thefew pieces of clothing she had taken off and was whistling tunelessly as ifnothing had happened.And then the nagual saw that in relaxing to accept the presence of death, theman's body had released a protecting veil and revealed his true nature. He was adouble man of tremendous resources, capable of creating a screen for protectionor disguise- a natural sorcerer and a perfect candidate for a nagual apprentice,had it not been for the black shadow of death.The nagual was completely taken aback by that sight. He now understood thedesigns of the spirit, but failed to comprehend how such a useless man could fitin the sorcerers' scheme of things.The woman in the meantime had stood up and without so much as a glance at theman, whose body was contorting with death spasms, walked away.The nagual then saw her luminosity and realized that her extreme aggressivenesswas the result of an enormous flow of superfluous energy. He became convincedthat if she did not put that energy to sober use, it would get the best of herand there was no telling what misfortunes it would cause her.As the nagual watched the unconcern with which she walked away, he realized thatthe spirit had given him another manifestation. He needed to be calm,nonchalant. He needed to act as if he had nothing to lose and intervene for thehell of it. In true nagual fashion he decided to tackle the impossible with noone except the spirit as witness.Don Juan commented that it took incidents like this to test whether a nagual isthe real thing or a fake. Naguals make decisions. With no regard for theconsequences, they take action or choose not to. Imposters ponder and becomeparalyzed. The nagual Elias having made his decision, walked calmly to the sideof the dying man and did the first thing his body, not his mind, compelled himto do: he struck the man's assemblage point to cause him to enter intoheightened awareness. He struck him frantically again and again until hisassemblage point moved. Aided by the force of death itself, the nagual's blowssent the man's assemblage point to a place where death no longer mattered, andthere he stopped dying.By the time the actor was breathing again, the nagual had become aware of themagnitude of his responsibility. If the man was to fend off the force of hisdeath, it would be necessary for him to remain in deep heightened awarenessuntil death had been repelled. The man's advanced physical deterioration meanthe could not be moved from the spot or he would instantly die. The nagual didthe only thing possible under the circumstances: He built a shack around thebody. There, for three months, he nursed the totally immobilized man.My rational thoughts took over, and instead of just listening, I wanted to knowhow the nagual Elias could build a shack on someone else's land. I was aware ofthe rural peoples' passion about land ownership and its accompanying feelings ofterritoriality.Don Juan admitted that he had asked the same question himself. And the nagualElias had said that the spirit itself had made it possible. This was the casewith everything a nagual undertook, providing he followed the spirit'smanifestations.The first thing the nagual Elias did when the actor was breathing again, was torun after the young woman. She was an important part of the spirit'smanifestation. He caught up with her not too far from the spot where the actorlay barely alive. Rather than talking to her about the man's plight and tryingto convince her to help him, he again assumed total responsibility for hisactions and jumped on her like a lion, striking her assemblage point a mightyblow. Both she and the actor were capable of sustaining life or death blows. Herassemblage point moved, but began to shift erratically once it was loose.The nagual carried the young woman to where the actor lay. Then he spent theentire day trying to keep her from losing her mind and the man from losing hislife. When he was fairly certain he had a degree of control he went to thewoman's father and told him that lightning must have struck his daughter andmade her temporarily mad. He took the father to where she lay and said that theyoung man, whoever he was, had taken the whole charge of the lightning with hisbody, thus saving the girl from certain death, but injuring himself to the pointthat he could not be moved.The grateful father helped the nagual build the shack for the man who had savedhis daughter. And in three months the nagual accomplished the impossible. Hehealed the young man.When the time came for the nagual to leave, his sense of responsibility and hisduty required him both to warn the young woman about her excess energy and theinjurious consequences it would have on her life and well being, and to ask herto join the sorcerers' world, as that would be the only defense against herself-destructive strength.The woman did not respond. And the nagual Elias was obliged to tell her whatevery nagual has said to a prospective apprentice throughout the ages: thatsorcerers speak of sorcery as a magical, mysterious bird which has paused in itsflight for a moment in order to give man hope and purpose; that sorcerers liveunder the wing of that bird, which they call the bird of wisdom, the bird offreedom; that they nourish it with their dedication and impeccability. He toldher that sorcerers knew the flight of the bird of freedom was always a straightline. It had no way of making a loop, no way of circling back and returning; andthat the bird of freedom could do only two things: take sorcerers along, orleave them behind.The nagual Elias could not talk to the young actor, who was still mortally ill,in the same way. The young man did not have much of a choice. Still, the nagualtold him that if he wanted to be cured, he would have to follow the nagualunconditionally. The actor accepted the terms instantly.The day the nagual Elias and the actor started back home, the young woman waswaiting silently at the edge of town. She carried no suitcases; not even abasket. She seemed to have come merely to see them off.The nagual kept walking without looking at her, but the actor, being carried ona stretcher, strained to say goodbye to her. She laughed and wordlessly mergedinto the nagual's party. She had no doubts and no problem about leavingeverything behind. She had understood perfectly that there was no second chancefor her; that the bird of freedom either took sorcerers along or left thembehind.Don Juan commented that that was not surprising. The force of the nagual'spersonality was always so overwhelming that he was practically irresistible, andthe nagual Elias had affected those two people deeply. He had had three monthsof daily interaction to accustom them to his consistency, his detachment, andhis objectivity. They had become enchanted by his sobriety and, above all, byhis total dedication to them. Through his example and his actions, the nagualElias had given them a sustained view of the sorcerers' world: supportive andnurturing, yet utterly demanding. It was a world that admitted very fewmistakes.Don Juan reminded me then of something he had repeated to me often but which Ihad always managed not to think about. He said that I should not forget, evenfor an instant, that the bird of freedom had very little patience withindecision, and when it flew away, it never returned.The chilling resonance of his voice made the surroundings, which only a secondbefore had been peacefully dark, burst with immediacy. Don Juan summoned thepeaceful darkness back as fast as he had summoned urgency. He punched me lightlyon the arm.\"That woman was so powerful that she could dance circles around anyone,\" hesaid. \"Her name was Talia.\"================================================================= Part 2. The Knock of the Spirit"},{"pageContent":"The AbstractWe returned to don Juan's house in the early hours of the morning. It took us along time to climb down the mountain, mainly because I was afraid of stumblinginto a precipice in the dark, and don Juan had to keep stopping to catch thebreath he lost laughing at me.I was dead tired, but I could not fall asleep. Before noon, it began to rain.The sound of the heavy downpour on the tile roof, instead of making me feeldrowsy, removed every trace of sleepiness.I got up and went to look for don Juan. I found him dozing in a chair. Themoment I approached him he was wide-awake. I said good morning.\"You seem to be having no trouble falling asleep,\" I commented.\"When you have been afraid or upset, don't lie down to sleep,\" he said withoutlooking at me. \"Sleep sitting up on a soft chair as I'm doing.\"He had suggested once that if I wanted to give my body healing rest, I shouldtake long naps lying on my stomach with my face turned to the left and my feetover the foot of the bed. In order to avoid being cold, he recommended I put asoft pillow over my shoulders, away from my neck, and wear heavy socks, or justleave my shoes on.When I first heard his suggestion, I thought he was being funny, but I laterchanged my mind. Sleeping in that position helped me rest extraordinarily well.When I commented on the surprising results, he advised that I follow hissuggestions to the letter without bothering to believe or disbelieve him.I suggested to don Juan that he might have told me the night before about thesleeping in a sitting position. I explained to him that the cause of mysleeplessness, besides my extreme fatigue, was a strange concern about what hehad told me in the sorcerer's cave.\"Cut it out!\" he exclaimed. \"You've seen and heard infinitely more distressingthings without losing a moment's sleep. Something else is bothering you.\"For a moment I thought he meant I was not being truthful with him about my realpreoccupation. I began to explain, but he kept talking as if I had not spoken.\"You stated categorically last night that the cave didn't make you feel ill atease,\" he said. \"Well, it obviously did. Last night I didn't pursue the subjectof the cave any further because I was waiting to observe your reaction.\"Don Juan explained that the cave had been designed by sorcerers in ancient timesto serve as a catalyst. Its shape had been carefully constructed to accommodatetwo people as two fields of energy. The theory of the sorcerers was that thenature of the rock and the manner in which it had been carved allowed the twobodies, the two luminous balls, to intertwine their energy.\"I took you to that cave on purpose,\" he continued, \"not because I like theplace- I don't- but because it was created as an instrument to push theapprentice deep into heightened awareness. But unfortunately, as it helps, italso obscures issues. The ancient sorcerers were not given to thought. Theyleaned toward action.\"\"You always say that your benefactor was like that,\" I said.\"That's my own exaggeration,\" he answered, \"very much like when I say you're afool. My benefactor was a modern nagual, involved in the pursuit of freedom, buthe leaned toward action instead of thoughts. You're a modern nagual, involved inthe same quest, but you lean heavily toward the aberrations of reason.\"He must have thought his comparison was very funny; his laughter echoed in theempty room.When I brought the conversation back to the subject of the cave, he pretendednot to hear me. I knew he was pretending because of the glint in his eyes andthe way he smiled.\"Last night, I deliberately told you the first abstract core,\" he said, \"in thehope that by reflecting on the way I have acted with you over the years you'llget an idea about the other cores. You've been with me for a long time so youknow me very well. During every minute of our association I have tried to adjustmy actions and thoughts to the patterns of the abstract cores.\"The nagual Elias's story is another matter. Although it seems to be a storyabout people, it is really a story about intent. Intent creates edifices [*edifice- a structure that has a roof and walls stands more or less permanentlyin one place] before us and invites us to enter them. This is the way sorcerersunderstand what is happening around them.\"Don Juan reminded me that I had always insisted on trying to discover theunderlying order in everything he said to me. I thought he was criticizing mefor my attempt to turn whatever he was teaching me into a social scienceproblem. I began to tell him that my outlook had changed under his influence. Hestopped me and smiled.\"You really don't think too well,\" he said and sighed. \"I want you to understandthe underlying order of what I teach you. My objection is to what you think isthe underlying order. To you, it means secret procedures or a hiddenconsistency. To me, it means two things: both the edifice that intentmanufactures in the blink of an eye and places in front of us to enter, and thesigns it gives us so we won't get lost once we are inside.\"As you can see, the story of the nagual Elias was more than merely an accountof the sequential details that made up the event,\" he went on. \"Underneath allthat was the edifice of intent. And the story was meant to give you an idea ofwhat the naguals of the past were like, so that you would recognize how theyacted in order to adjust their thoughts and actions to the edifices of intent\"There was a prolonged silence. I did not have anything to say. Rather than letthe conversation die, I said the first thing that came into my mind. I said thatfrom the stories I had heard about the nagual Elias I had formed a very positiveopinion of him. I liked the nagual Elias, but for unknown reasons, everythingdon Juan had told me about the nagual Julian bothered me.The mere mention of my discomfort delighted don Juan beyond measure. He had tostand up from his chair lest he choke on his laughter. He put his arm on myshoulder and said that we either loved or hated those who were reflections ofourselves.Again a silly self-consciousness prevented me from asking him what he meant. DonJuan kept on laughing, obviously aware of my mood. He finally commented that thenagual Julian was like a child whose sobriety and moderation came always fromwithout. He had no inner discipline beyond his training as an apprentice insorcery.I had an irrational urge to defend myself. I told don Juan that my disciplinecame from within me.\"Of course,\" he said patronizingly. \"You just can't expect to be exactly likehim.\" And began to laugh again.Sometimes don Juan exasperated me so that I was ready to yell. But my mood didnot last. It dissipated so rapidly that another concern began to loom. I askeddon Juan if it was possible that I had entered into heightened awareness withoutbeing conscious of it? Or maybe I had remained in it for days?\"At this stage you enter into heightened awareness all by yourself,\" he said.\"Heightened awareness is a mystery only for our reason. In practice, it's verysimple. As with everything else, we complicate matters by trying to make theimmensity that surrounds us reasonable.\"He remarked that I should be thinking about the abstract core he had given meinstead of arguing uselessly about my person.I told him that I had been thinking about it all morning and had come to realizethat the metaphorical theme of the story was the manifestations of the spirit.What I could not discern, however, was the abstract core he was talking about.It had to be something unstated.\"I repeat,\" he said, as if he were a schoolteacher drilling his students, \"themanifestations of the spirit is the name for the first abstract core in thesorcery stories. Obviously, what sorcerers recognize as an abstract core issomething that bypasses you at this moment. That part which escapes yousorcerers know as the edifice of intent, or the silent voice of the spirit, orthe ulterior arrangement of the abstract.\"I said I understood ulterior to mean something not overtly revealed, as in'ulterior motive'. And he replied that in this case ulterior meant more; itmeant knowledge without words, outside our immediate comprehension- especiallymine. He allowed that the comprehension he was referring to was merely beyond myaptitudes of the moment; not beyond my ultimate possibilities for understanding.\"If the abstract cores are beyond my comprehension, what's the point of talkingabout them?\" I asked.\"The rule says that the abstract cores and the sorcery stories must be told atthis point,\" he replied. \"And some day the ulterior arrangement of the abstract,which is knowledge without words or the edifice of intent inherent in thestories, will be revealed to you by the stories themselves.\"I still did not understand.\"The ulterior arrangement of the abstract is not merely the order in which theabstract cores were presented to you,\" he explained, \"or what they have incommon either, nor even the web that joins them. Rather it's to know theabstract directly, without the intervention of language.\"He scrutinized me in silence from head to toe with the obvious purpose of seeingme.\"It's not evident to you yet,\" he declared.He made a gesture of impatience, even short temper, as though he were annoyed atmy slowness. And that worried me. Don Juan was not given to expressions ofpsychological displeasure.\"It has nothing to do with you or your actions,\" he said when I asked if he wasangry or disappointed with me. \"It was a thought that crossed my mind the momentI saw you. There is a feature in your luminous being that the old sorcererswould have given anything to have.\"\"Tell me what it is,\" I demanded.\"I'll remind you of this some other time,\" he said.\"Meanwhile, let's continue with the element that propels us: the abstract; theelement without which there could be no warrior's path, nor any warriors insearch of knowledge.\"He said that the difficulties I was experiencing were nothing new to him. Hehimself had gone through agonies in order to understand the ulterior order ofthe abstract. And had it not been for the helping hand of the nagual Elias, hewould have wound up just like his benefactor, all action and very littleunderstanding.\"What was the nagual Elias like?\" I asked, to change the subject.\"He was not like his disciple at all,\" don Juan said. \"He was an Indian. Verydark and massive. He had rough features, big mouth, strong nose, small blackeyes, thick black hair with no gray in it. He was shorter than the nagual Julianand had big hands and feet. He was very humble and very wise, but he had noflare. Compared with my benefactor, he was dull. Always all by himself,pondering questions. The nagual Julian used to joke that his teacher impartedwisdom by the ton. Behind his back he used to call him the nagual Tonnage.\"I never saw the reason for his jokes,\" don Juan went on. \"To me the nagualElias was like a breath of fresh air. He would patiently explain everything tome. Very much as I explain things to you, but perhaps with a bit more ofsomething. I wouldn't call it compassion, but rather, empathy. Warriors areincapable of feeling compassion because they no longer feel sorry forthemselves. Without the driving force of self-pity, compassion is meaningless.\"\"Are you saying, don Juan, that a warrior is all for himself?\"\"In a way, yes. For a warrior everything begins and ends with himself. However,his contact with the abstract causes him to overcome his feeling ofself-importance. Then the self becomes abstract and impersonal.\"The nagual Elias felt that our lives and our personalities were quite similar,\"don Juan continued. \"For this reason, he felt obliged to help me. I don't feelthat similarity with you, so I suppose I regard you very much the way the nagualJulian used to regard me.\"Don Juan said that the nagual Elias took him under his wing from the very firstday he arrived at his benefactor's house to start his apprenticeship and beganto explain what was taking place in his training, regardless of whether don Juanwas capable of understanding. His urge to help don Juan was so intense that hepractically held him prisoner. He protected him in this manner from the nagualJulian's harsh onslaughts.\"At the beginning, I used to stay at the nagual Elias's house all the time,\" donJuan continued. \"And I loved it. In my benefactor's house I was always on thelookout; on guard; afraid of what he was going to do to me next. But in theNagual Elias's home, I felt confident, at ease.\"My benefactor used to press me mercilessly. And I couldn't figure out why hewas pressuring me so hard. I thought that the man was plain crazy.\"Don Juan said that the nagual Elias was an Indian from the state of Oaxaca, whohad been taught by another nagual named Rosendo, who came from the same area.Don Juan described the nagual Elias as being a very conservative man whocherished his privacy. And yet he was a famous healer and sorcerer, not only inOaxaca, but in all of southern Mexico. Nonetheless, in spite of his occupationand notoriety, he lived in complete isolation at the opposite end of thecountry, in northern Mexico.Don Juan stopped talking. Raising his eyebrows, he fixed me with a questioninglook. But all I wanted was for him to continue his story.\"Every single time I think you should ask questions, you don't,\" he said. \"I'msure you heard me say that the nagual Elias was a famous sorcerer who dealt withpeople daily in southern Mexico, and at the same time he was a hermit innorthern Mexico. Doesn't that arouse your curiosity?\"I felt abysmally stupid. I told him that the thought had crossed my mind, as hewas telling me those facts, that the man must have had terrible difficultycommuting.Don Juan laughed, and since he had made me aware of the question, I asked how ithad been possible for the nagual Elias to be in two places at once.\"Dreaming is a sorcerer's jet plane,\" he said. \"The nagual Elias was a dreameras my benefactor was a stalker. He was able to create and project what sorcerersknow as the dreaming body, or the Other; and to be in two distant places at thesame time. With his dreaming body, he could carry on his business as a sorcerer,and with his natural self be a recluse.\"I remarked that it amazed me that I could accept so easily the premise that thenagual Elias had the ability to project a solid three-dimensional image ofhimself, and yet could not for the life of me understand the explanations aboutthe abstract cores.Don Juan said that I could accept the idea of the nagual Elfas's dual lifebecause the spirit was making final adjustments in my capacity for awareness.And I exploded into a barrage of protests at the obscurity of his statement.\"It isn't obscure,\" he said. \"It's a statement of fact. You could say that it'san incomprehensible fact for the moment, but the moment will change.\"Before I could reply, he began to talk again about the nagual Elias. He saidthat the nagual Elias had a very inquisitive mind and could work well with hishands. In his journeys as a dreamer, he saw many objects which he copied in woodand forged iron. Don Juan assured me that some of those models were of ahaunting, exquisite beauty.\"What kind of objects were the originals?\" I asked.\"There's no way of knowing,\" don Juan said. \"You've got to consider that becausehe was an Indian, the nagual Elias went into his dreaming journeys the way awild animal prowls for food. An animal never shows up at a site when there aresigns of activity. He comes only when no one is around. The nagual Elias as asolitary dreamer visited, let's say, the junkyard of infinity when no one wasaround, and copied whatever he saw, but never knew what those things were usedfor, or their source.\"Again I had no trouble accepting what he was saying. The idea did not appear tome farfetched in any way. I was about to comment when he interrupted me with agesture of his eyebrows. He then continued his account about the nagual Elias.\"Visiting him was for me the ultimate treat,\" he said, \"and simultaneously, asource of strange guilt. I used to get bored to death there. Not because thenagual Elfas was boring, but because the nagual Julian had no peers and hespoiled anyone for life.\"\"But I thought you were confident and at ease in the nagual Elias's house,\" Isaid.\"I was, and that was the source of my guilt and my imagined problem. Like you, Iloved to torment myself. I think at the very beginning I found peace in thenagual Elias's company, but later on, when I understood the nagual Julianbetter, I went his way.\"He told me that the nagual Elias's house had an open, roofed section in thefront, where he had a forge and a carpentry bench and tools. The tiled-roofadobe house consisted of a huge room with a dirt floor where he lived with fivewomen seers, who were actually his wives. There were also four men,sorcerer-seers of his party who lived in small houses around the nagual's house.They were all Indians from different parts of the country who had migrated tonorthern Mexico.\"The nagual Elias had great respect for sexual energy,\" don Juan said. \"Hebelieved it has been given to us so we can use it in dreaming. He believeddreaming had fallen into disuse because it can upset the precarious mentalbalance of susceptible people.\"I've taught you dreaming the same way he taught me,\" he continued. \"He taughtme that while we dream, the assemblage point moves very gently and naturally.Mental balance is nothing but the fixing of the assemblage point on one spotwe're accustomed to. If dreams make that point move, and dreaming is used tocontrol that natural movement, and sexual energy is needed for dreaming, theresult is sometimes disastrous when sexual energy is dissipated in sex insteadof dreaming. Then dreamers move their assemblage point erratically and losetheir minds.\"\"What are you trying to tell me, don Juan?\" I asked because I felt that thesubject of dreaming had not been a natural drift in the conversation.\"You are a dreamer\" he said. \"If you're not careful with your sexual energy, youmight as well get used to the idea of erratic shifts of your assemblage point. Amoment ago you were bewildered by your reactions. Well, your assemblage pointmoves almost erratically because your sexual energy is not in balance.\"I made a stupid and inappropriate comment about the sex life of adult males.\"Our sexual energy is what governs dreaming,\" he explained. \"The nagual Eliastaught me- and I taught you- that you either make love with your sexual energyor you dream with it. There is no other way. The reason I mention it at all isbecause you are having great difficulty shifting your assemblage point to graspour last topic: the abstract.\"The same thing happened to me,\" don Juan went on. \"It was only when my sexualenergy was freed from the world that everything fit into place. That is the rulefor dreamers. Stalkers are the opposite. My benefactor was, you could say, asexual libertine both as an average man and as a nagual.\"Don Juan seemed to be on the verge of revealing his benefactor's doings, but heobviously changed his mind. He shook his head and said that I was way too stifffor such revelations. I did not insist.He said that the nagual Elias had the sobriety that only dreamers acquired afterinconceivable battles with themselves. He used his sobriety to plunge himselfinto the task of answering don Juan's questions.\"The nagual Elias explained that my difficulty in understanding the spirit wasthe same as his own,\" don Juan continued. \"He thought there were two differentissues. One, the need to understand indirectly what the spirit is, and theother, to understand the spirit directly.\"You're having problems with the first. Once you understand what the spirit is,the second issue will be resolved automatically, and vice versa. If the spiritspeaks to you, using its silent words, you will certainly know immediately whatthe spirit is.\"He said that the nagual Elias believed that the difficulty was our reluctance toaccept the idea that knowledge could exist without words to explain it.\"But I have no difficulty accepting that,\" I said.\"Accepting this proposition is not as easy as saying you accept it,\" don Juansaid. \"The nagual Elias used to tell me that the whole of humanity has movedaway from the abstract, although at one time we must have been close to it. Itmust have been our sustaining force. And then something happened and pulled usaway from the abstract. Now we can't get back to it. He used to say that ittakes years for an apprentice to be able to go back to the abstract, that is, toknow that knowledge and language can exist independent of each other.\"Don Juan repeated that the crux of our difficulty in going back to the abstractwas our refusal to accept that we could know without words, or even withoutthoughts.I was going to argue that he was talking nonsense when I got the strong feelingI was missing something and that his point was of crucial importance to me. Hewas really trying to tell me something; something I either could not grasp orwhich could not be told completely.\"Knowledge and language are separate,\" he repeated softly.And I was just about to say, \"I know it,\" as if indeed I knew it, when I caughtmyself.\"I told you there is no way to talk about the spirit,\" he continued, \"becausethe spirit can only be experienced. Sorcerers try to explain this condition whenthey say that the spirit is nothing you can see or feel. But it's there loomingover us always. Sometimes it comes to some of us. Most of the time it seemsindifferent.\"I kept quiet. And he continued to explain. He said that the spirit in many wayswas a sort of wild animal. It kept its distance from us until a moment whensomething enticed it forward. It was then that the spirit manifested itself.I raised the point that if the spirit wasn't an entity, or a presence, and hadno essence, how could anyone entice it?\"Your problem,\" he said, \"is that you consider only your own idea of what'sabstract. For instance, the inner essence of man, or the fundamental principle,are abstracts for you. Or perhaps something a bit less vague, such as:character, volition, courage, dignity, honor. The spirit, of course, can bedescribed in terms of all of these. And that's what's so confusing- that it'sall these and none of them.\"He added that what I considered abstractions were either the opposites of allthe practicalities I could think of, or things I had decided did not haveconcrete existence.\"Whereas for a sorcerer an abstract is something with no parallel in the humancondition,\" he said.\"But they're the same thing,\" I shouted. \"Don't you see that we're both talkingabout the same thing?\"\"We are not,\" he insisted. \"For a sorcerer, the spirit is an abstract simplybecause he knows it without words or even thoughts. It's an abstract because hecan't conceive what the spirit is. Yet without the slightest chance or desire tounderstand it, a sorcerer handles the spirit. He recognizes it, beckons it,entices it, becomes familiar with it, and expresses it with his acts.\"I shook my head in despair. I could not see the difference.\"The root of your misconception is that I have used the term 'abstract' todescribe the spirit,\" he said. \"For you, abstracts are words which describestates of intuition. An example is the word 'spirit' which doesn't describereason or pragmatic experience, and which, of course, is of no use to you otherthan to tickle your fancy.\"I was furious with don Juan. I called him obstinate and he laughed at me. Hesuggested that if I would think about the proposition that knowledge might beindependent of language, without bothering to understand it, perhaps I could seethe light.\"Consider this,\" he said. \"It was not the act of meeting me that mattered toyou. The day I met you, you met the abstract. But since you couldn't talk aboutit, you didn't notice it. Sorcerers meet the abstract without thinking about itor seeing it or touching it or feeling its presence.\"I remained quiet because I did not enjoy arguing with him. At times I consideredhim to be quite willfully abstruse. [* abstruse- difficult to penetrate;incomprehensible to one of ordinary understanding or knowledge] But don Juanseemed to be enjoying himself immensely. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Last Seduction of the Nagual JulianIt was as cool and quiet in the patio of don Juan's house as in the cloister ofa convent. There were a number of large fruit trees planted extremely closetogether, which seemed to regulate the temperature and absorb all noises. When Ifirst came to his house, I had made critical remarks about the illogical way thefruit trees had been planted. I would have given them more space.His answer was that those trees were not his property, they were free andindependent warrior trees that had joined his party of warriors; and that mycomments- which applied to regular trees- were not relevant. His reply soundedmetaphorical to me. What I didn't know then was that don Juan meant everythinghe said literally. Don Juan and I were sitting in cane armchairs facing the fruit trees now. Thetrees were all bearing fruit. I commented that it was not only a beautiful sightbut an extremely intriguing one, for it was not the fruit season.\"There is an interesting story about it,\" he admitted. \"As you know, these treesare warriors of my party. They are bearing now because all the members of myparty have been talking and expressing feelings about our definitive journey,here in front of them. And the trees know now that when we embark on ourdefinitive journey, they will accompany us.\"I looked at him, astonished.\"I can't leave them behind,\" he explained. \"They are warriors too. They havethrown their lot in with the nagual's party. And they know how I feel aboutthem. The assemblage point of trees is located very low in their enormousluminous shell, and that permits them to know our feelings; for instance, thefeelings we are having now as we discuss my definitive journey.\"I remained quiet, for I did not want to dwell on the subject. Don Juan spoke anddispelled my mood.\"The second abstract core of the sorcery stories is called the Knock of theSpirit,\" he said. \"The first core, the Manifestations of the Spirit, is theedifice that intent builds and places before a sorcerer, then invites him toenter. It is the edifice of intent seen by a sorcerer. The Knock of the Spiritis the same edifice seen by the beginner who is invited- or rather forced- toenter.\"This second abstract core could be a story in itself. The story says that afterthe spirit had manifested itself to that man we have talked about and had gottenno response, the spirit laid a trap for the man. It was a final subterfuge, notbecause the man was special, but because the incomprehensible chain of events ofthe spirit made that man available at the very moment that the spirit knocked onthe door.\"It goes without saying that whatever the spirit revealed to that man made nosense to him. In fact, it went against everything the man knew; everything hewas. The man of course- in no uncertain terms- refused on the spot to haveanything to do with the spirit. He wasn't going to fall for such preposterousnonsense. He knew better. The result was a total stalemate. [* stalemate- asituation in which no progress can be made or no advancement is possible]\"I can say that this is an idiotic story,\" he continued. \"I can say that whatI've given you is the pacifier [* pacifier- someone or something intended tobring peace] for those who are uncomfortable with the silence of the abstract.\"He peered at me for a moment and then smiled.\"You like words,\" he said accusingly. \"The mere idea of silent knowledge scaresyou. But stories, no matter how stupid, delight you and make you feel secure.\"His smile was so mischievous that I couldn't help laughing.Then he reminded me that I had already heard his detailed account of the firsttime the spirit had knocked on his door. For a moment I could not figure outwhat he was talking about.\"It was not just my benefactor who stumbled upon me as I was dying from thegunshot,\" he explained. \"The spirit also found me and knocked on my door thatday. My benefactor understood that he was there to be a conduit for the spirit.Without the spirit's intervention, meeting my benefactor would have meantnothing.\"He said that a nagual can be a conduit only after the spirit has manifested itswillingness to be used- either almost imperceptibly or with outright commands.It was therefore not possible for a nagual to choose his apprentices accordingto his own volition, or his own calculations. But once the willingness of thespirit was revealed through omens, the nagual spared no effort to satisfy it.\"After a lifetime of practice,\" he continued, \"sorcerers and naguals inparticular know if the spirit is inviting them to enter the edifice beingflaunted before them. They have learned to discipline their connecting links tointent. So they are always forewarned; always know what the spirit has in storefor them.\"Don Juan said that progress along the sorcerers' path was, in general, a drasticprocess the purpose of which was to bring this connecting link to order. Theaverage man's connecting link with intent is practically dead, and sorcerersbegin with a link that is useless because it does not respond voluntarily.He stressed that in order to revive that link sorcerers needed a rigorous,fierce purpose- a special state of mind called unbending intent. Accepting thatthe nagual was the only being capable of supplying unbending intent was the mostdifficult part of the sorcerer's apprenticeship. I argued that I could not seethe difficulty.\"An apprentice is someone who is striving to clear and revive his connectinglink with the spirit,\" he explained. \"Once the link is revived, he is no longeran apprentice; but until that time, in order to keep going he needs a fiercepurpose, which of course he doesn't have. So he allows the nagual to provide thepurpose, and to do that he has to relinquish his individuality. That's thedifficult part.\"He reminded me of something he had told me often: that volunteers were notwelcome in the sorcerers' world because they already had a purpose of their own-which made it particularly hard for them to relinquish their individuality. Ifthe sorcerers' world demanded ideas and actions contrary to the volunteers'purpose, the volunteers simply refused to change.\"Reviving an apprentice's link is a nagual's most challenging and intriguingwork,\" don Juan continued, \"and one of his biggest headaches too. Depending, ofcourse, on the apprentice's personality, the designs of the spirit are eithersublimely simple or the most complex labyrinths.\" [* labyrinth- complex systemof paths or tunnels in which it is easy to get lost]Don Juan assured me that, although I might have had notions to the contrary, myapprenticeship had not been as onerous to him as his must have been to hisbenefactor. He admitted that I had a modicum of self-discipline that came invery handy, while he had had none whatever. And his benefactor, in turn, had hadeven less.\"The difference is discernible in the manifestations of the spirit,\" hecontinued. \"In some cases, they are barely noticeable. In my case, they werecommands. I had been shot. Blood was pouring out of a hole in my chest. Mybenefactor had to act with speed and sureness, just as his own benefactor hadfor him. Sorcerers know that the more difficult the command is, the moredifficult the disciple turns out to be.\"Don Juan explained that one of the most advantageous aspects of his associationwith two naguals was that he could hear the same stories from two oppositepoints of view. For instance, the story about the nagual Elias and themanifestations of the spirit from the apprentice's perspective, was the story ofthe spirit's difficult knock on his benefactor's door.\"Everything connected with my benefactor was very difficult,\" he said and beganto laugh. \"When he was twenty-four years old, the spirit didn't just knock onhis door, it nearly banged it down.\"He said that the story had really begun years earlier when his benefactor hadbeen a handsome adolescent from a good family in Mexico City. He was wealthy,educated, charming, and had a charismatic personality. Women fell in love withhim at first sight. But he was already self-indulgent and undisciplined; lazyabout anything that did not give him immediate gratification.Don Juan said that with that personality and his type of upbringing- he was theonly son of a wealthy widow who, together with his four adoring sisters, dotedon him- he could only behave one way. He indulged in every impropriety he couldthink of. Even among his equally self-indulgent friends, he was seen as a moraldelinquent who lived to do anything that the world considered morally wrong.In the long run, his excesses weakened him physically and he fell mortally illwith tuberculosis- [* tuberculosis- infection transmitted by inhalation oringestion of tubercle bacilli and manifested in fever and small lesions (usuallyin the lungs but in various other parts of the body in acute stages)] thedreaded disease of the time. But his illness, instead of restraining him,created a physical condition in which he felt more sensual than ever. Since hedid not have one iota of self-control, he gave himself over fully to debauchery,[* debauchery- a wild gathering involving excessive drinking and promiscuity]and his health deteriorated until there was no hope.The saying that 'it never rains but it pours' was certainly true for don Juan'sbenefactor then. As his health declined, his mother, who was his only source ofsupport and the only restraint on him, died. She left him a sizable inheritancewhich should have supported him adequately for life, but undisciplined as hewas, in a few months he had spent every cent. With no profession or trade tofall back on, he was left to scrounge for a living.Without money he no longer had friends; and even the women who once loved himturned their backs. For the first time in his life, he found himself confrontinga harsh reality. Considering the state of his health, it should have been theend. But he was resilient. He decided to work for a living.His sensual habits, however, could not be changed, and they forced him to seekwork in the only place he felt comfortable: the theater. His qualifications werethat he was a born ham, and had spent most of his adult life in the company ofactresses. He joined a theatrical troupe in the provinces away from his familiarcircle of friends and acquaintances, and became a very intense actor; theconsumptive hero in religious and morality plays.Don Juan commented on the strange irony that had always marked his benefactor'slife. There he was, a perfect reprobate, [* reprobate- a person without moralscruples] dying as a result of his dissolute ways, and playing the roles ofsaints and mystics. He even played Jesus in the Passion Play during Holy Week.His health lasted through one theatrical tour of the northern states. Then twothings happened in the city of Durango: his life came to an end, and the spiritknocked on his door.Both his death and the spirit's knock came at the same time- in broad daylightin the bushes. His death caught him in the act of seducing a young woman. He wasalready extremely weak, and that day he overexerted himself. The young woman,who was vivacious and strong and madly infatuated, had by promising to make loveinduced him to walk to a secluded spot miles from nowhere. And there she hadfought him off for hours. When she finally submitted, he was completely wornout, and coughing so badly that he could hardly breathe.During his last passionate outburst he felt a searing pain in his shoulder. Hischest felt as if it were being ripped apart and a coughing spell made him retchuncontrollably. But his compulsion to seek pleasure kept him going until hisdeath came in the form of a hemorrhage. It was then that the spirit made itsentry, borne by an Indian who came to his aid. Earlier he had noticed the Indianfollowing them around, but had not given him a second thought, absorbed as hewas in the seduction.He saw, as in a dream, the girl. She was not scared nor did she lose hercomposure. Quietly and efficiently she put her clothes back on, and took off asfast as a rabbit chased by hounds.He also saw the Indian rushing to him trying to make him sit up. He heard himsaying idiotic things. He heard him pledging himself to the spirit and mumblingincomprehensible words in a foreign language. Then the Indian acted veryquickly. Standing behind him, he gave him a smacking blow on the back.Very rationally, the dying man deduced that the Indian was trying either todislodge the blood clot or to kill him.As the Indian struck him repeatedly on the back, the dying man became convincedthat the Indian was the woman's lover or husband and was murdering him. Butseeing the intensely brilliant eyes of that Indian, he changed his mind. He knewthat the Indian was simply crazy and was not connected with the woman.With his last bit of consciousness, he focused his attention on the man'smumblings. What he was saying was that the power of man was incalculable; thatdeath existed only because we had intended it since the moment of our birth;that the intent of death could be suspended by making the assemblage pointchange positions.He then knew that the Indian was totally insane. His situation was sotheatrical- dying at the hands of a crazy Indian mumbling gibberish- that hevowed he would be a ham actor to the bitter end, and he promised himself not todie of either the hemorrhaging or the blows, but to die of laughter. And helaughed until he was dead.Don Juan remarked that naturally his benefactor could not possibly have takenthe Indian seriously. No one could take such a person seriously, especially nota prospective apprentice who was not supposed to be volunteering for the sorcerytask.Don Juan then said that he had given me different versions of what that sorcerytask consisted. He said it would not be presumptuous of him to disclose that,from the spirit's point of view, the task consisted of clearing our connectinglink with it.The edifice that intent flaunts before us is, then, a clearinghouse; withinwhich we find not so much the procedures to clear our connecting link, as thesilent knowledge that allows the clearing process to take place. Without thatsilent knowledge no process could work, and all we would have would be anindefinite sense of needing something.He explained that the events unleashed by sorcerers as a result of silentknowledge were so simple and yet so abstract that sorcerers had decided long agoto speak of those events only in symbolic terms. The manifestations and theknock of the spirit were examples.Don Juan said that, for instance, a description of what took place during theinitial meeting between a nagual and a prospective apprentice from thesorcerers' point of view, would be absolutely incomprehensible.It would be nonsense to explain that the nagual, by virtue of his lifelongexperience, was focusing something we couldn't imagine, his second attention-the increased awareness gained through sorcery training- on his invisibleconnection with some indefinable abstract. He was doing this to emphasize andclarify someone else's invisible connection with that indefinable abstract.He remarked that each of us was barred from silent knowledge by naturalbarriers, specific to each individual; and that the most impregnable of mybarriers was the drive to disguise my complacency as independence.I challenged him to give me a concrete example. I reminded him that he had oncewarned me that a favorite debating ploy was to raise general criticisms thatcould not be supported by concrete examples. Don Juan looked at me and beamed.\"In the past, I used to give you power plants,\" he said. \"At first, you went toextremes to convince yourself that what you were experiencing werehallucinations. Then you wanted them to be special hallucinations. I remember Imade fun of your insistence on calling them didactic hallucinatory experiences.\"He said that my need to prove my illusory independence forced me into a positionwhere I could not accept what he had told me was happening, although it was whatI silently knew for myself. I knew he was employing power plants, as the verylimited tools they were, to make me enter partial or temporary states ofheightened awareness by moving my assemblage point away from its habituallocation.\"You used your barrier of independence to get you over that obstruction,\" hewent on. \"The same barrier has continued to work to this day, so you stillretain that sense of indefinite anguish, perhaps not so pronounced. Now thequestion is, how are you arranging your conclusions so that your currentexperiences fit into your scheme of complacency?\"I confessed that the only way I could maintain my independence was not to thinkabout my experiences at all.Don Juan's hearty laugh nearly made him fall out of his cane chair. He stood andwalked around to catch his breath. He sat down again and composed himself. Hepushed his chair back and crossed his legs.He said that we, as average men, did not know, nor would we ever know, that itwas something utterly real and functional- our connecting link with intent-which gave us our hereditary preoccupation with fate. He asserted that duringour active lives we never have the chance to go beyond the level of merepreoccupation, because since time immemorial the lull of daily affairs has madeus drowsy.It is only when our lives are nearly over that our hereditary preoccupation withfate begins to take on a different character. It begins to make us see throughthe fog of daily affairs.Unfortunately, this awakening always comes hand in hand with loss of energycaused by aging; when we have no more strength left to turn our preoccupationinto a pragmatic and positive discovery. At this point, all there is left is anamorphous, piercing anguish, a longing for something indescribable, and simpleanger at having missed out.\"I like poems for many reasons,\" he said. \"One reason is that they catch themood of warriors and explain what can hardly be explained.\"He conceded that poets were keenly aware of our connecting link with the spirit,but that they were aware of it intuitively, not in the deliberate, pragmatic wayof sorcerers.\"Poets have no firsthand knowledge of the spirit,\" he went on. \"That is whytheir poems cannot really hit the center of true gestures for the spirit. Theyhit pretty close to it, though.\"He picked up one of my poetry books from a chair next to him, a collection byJuan Ramon Jimenez. He opened it to where he had placed a marker, handed it tome and signaled me to read. Is it I who walks tonight in my roomor is it the beggar who was prowling in my garden at nightfall?I look around and find that everything is the sameand it is not the sameWas the window open?Had I not already fallen asleep?Was not the garden pale green?...The sly was clear and blue...And there are clouds and it is windyand the garden is dark and gloomy.I think that my hair was black...I was dressed in grey...And my hair is greyand I am wearing black...Is this my gait?Does this voice, which now resounds in me,have the rhythms of the voice I used to have?Am I myself or am I the beggarwho was prowling in my garden at nightfall?I look around...There are clouds and it is windy...The garden is dark and gloomy...I come and go...Is it not true that I had already fallen asleep?My hair is grey...And everything is the same and it is not the same... I reread the poem to myself and I caught the poet's mood of impotence andbewilderment. I asked don Juan if he felt the same.\"I think the poet senses the pressure of aging and the anxiety that thatrealization produces,\" don Juan said. \"But that is only one part of it. Theother part, which interests me, is that the poet, although he never moves hisassemblage point, intuits that something extraordinary is at stake. He intuitswith great certainty that there is some unnamed factor, awesome because of itssimplicity, that is determining our fate.\" ================================================================= Part 3. The Trickery of the Spirit"},{"pageContent":"Dusting the Link with the SpiritThe sun had not yet risen from behind the eastern peaks, but the day was alreadyhot. As we reached the first steep slope a couple of miles along the road fromthe outskirts of town, don Juan stopped walking and moved to the side of thepaved highway. He sat down by some huge boulders that had been dynamited fromthe face of the mountain when they cut the road; and signaled me to join him. Weusually stopped there to talk or rest on our way to the nearby mountains. DonJuan announced that this trip was going to be long, and that we might be in themountains for days.\"We are going to talk now about the third abstract core,\" don Juan said. \"It iscalled the trickery of the spirit, or the trickery of the abstract, or stalkingoneself, or dusting the link.\"I was surprised at the variety of names, but said nothing. I waited for him tocontinue his explanation.\"And again, as with the first and second core,\" he went on, \"it could be a storyin itself. The story says that after knocking on the door of that man we've beentalking about, and having no success with him, the spirit used the only meansavailable: trickery. After all, the spirit had resolved previous impasses withtrickery. It was obvious that if it wanted to make an impact on this man it hadto cajole him. So the spirit began to instruct the man on the mysteries ofsorcery. And the sorcery apprenticeship became what it is: a route of artifice[* artifice- a deceptive manoeuvre] and subterfuge. [* subterfuge- somethingintended to misrepresent the true nature of an activity]\"The story says that the spirit cajoled the man by making him shift back andforth between levels of awareness to show him how to save the energy needed tostrengthen his connecting link.\"Don Juan told me that if we apply his story to a modern setting, we had the caseof the nagual- the living conduit of the spirit- repeating the structure of thisabstract core and resorting to artifice and subterfuge in order to teach.Suddenly he stood and started to walk toward the mountain range. I followed himand we started our climb, side by side.In the very late afternoon, we reached the top of the high mountains. Even atthat altitude, it was still very warm. All day we had followed a nearlyinvisible trail. Finally we reached a small clearing; an ancient lookout postcommanding the north and west.We sat there and don Juan returned our conversation to the sorcery stories. Hesaid that now I knew the story of intent manifesting itself to the nagual Eliasand the story of the spirit knocking on the nagual Julian's door. And I knew howhe had met the spirit, and I certainly could not forget how I had met it. Allthese stories, he declared, had the same structure; only the charactersdiffered. Each story was an abstract tragic comedy with one abstract player,intent, and two human actors, the nagual and his apprentice. The script was theabstract core.I thought I had finally understood what he meant, but I could not quite explaineven to myself what it was I understood, nor could I explain it to don Juan.When I tried to put my thoughts into words I found myself babbling.Don Juan seemed to recognize my state of mind. He suggested that I relax andlisten. He told me his next story was about the process of bringing anapprentice into the realm of the spirit; a process sorcerers called the trickeryof the spirit, or dusting the connecting link to intent.\"I've already told you the story of how the nagual Julian took me to his houseafter I was shot and tended my wound until I recovered,\" don Juan continued.\"But I didn't tell you how he dusted my link; how he taught me to stalk myself.\"The first thing a nagual does with his prospective apprentice is to trick him.That is, he gives him a jolt on his connecting link to the spirit. There are twoways of doing this. One is through semi-normal channels, which I used with you,and the other is by means of outright sorcery, which my benefactor used on me.\"Don Juan again told me the story of how his benefactor had convinced the peoplewho had gathered at the road that the wounded man was his son. Then he had paidsome men to carry don Juan, unconscious from shock and loss of blood, to his ownhouse. Don Juan woke there, days later, and found a kind old man and his fatwife tending his wound.The old man said his name was Belisario, and that his wife was a famous healer,and that both of them were healing his wound. Don Juan told them he had nomoney, and Belisario suggested that when he recovered, payment of some sortcould be arranged.Don Juan said that he was thoroughly confused, which was nothing new to him. Hewas just a muscular, reckless twenty-year-old Indian, with no brains, no formaleducation, and a terrible temper. He had no conception of gratitude. He thoughtit was very kind of the old man and his wife to have helped him, but hisintention was to wait for his wound to heal, and then simply vanish in themiddle of the night.When he had recovered enough and was ready to flee, old Belisario took him intoa room and in trembling whispers disclosed that the house where they werestaying belonged to a monstrous man who was holding his wife and him prisoner.He asked don Juan to help them to regain their freedom; to escape from theircaptor and tormentor.Before don Juan could reply, a monstrous fish-faced man right out of a horrortale burst into the room as if he had been listening behind the door. He wasgreenish-gray, had only one unblinking eye in the middle of his forehead, andwas as big as a door. He lurched at don Juan, hissing like a serpent ready totear him apart, and frightened him so greatly that he fainted.\"His way of giving me a jolt on my connecting link with the spirit wasmasterful.\" Don Juan laughed. \"My benefactor, of course, had shifted me intoheightened awareness prior to the monster's entrance, so that what I actuallysaw as a monstrous man was what sorcerers call an inorganic being; a formlessenergy field.\"Don Juan said that he knew countless cases in which his benefactor'sdevilishness created hilariously embarrassing situations for all hisapprentices, especially for don Juan himself, whose seriousness and stiffnessmade him the perfect subject for his benefactor's didactic [* didactic-instructive (especially excessively)] jokes. He added as an afterthought that itwent without saying that these jokes entertained his benefactor immensely.\"If you think I laugh at you- which I do- it's nothing compared with how helaughed at me,\" don Juan continued. \"My devilish benefactor had learned to weepto hide his laughter. You just can't imagine how he used to cry when I firstbegan my apprenticeship.\"Continuing with his story, don Juan stated that his life was never the sameafter the shock of seeing that monstrous man. His benefactor made sure of it.Don Juan explained that once a nagual has introduced his prospective disciple,especially his nagual disciple, to trickery he must struggle to assure hiscompliance. This compliance could be of two different kinds.Either the prospective disciple is so disciplined and tuned that only hisdecision to join the nagual is needed, as had been the case with young Talia; orthe prospective disciple is someone with little or no discipline, in which casea nagual has to expend time and a great deal of labor to convince his disciple.In don Juan's case, because he was a wild young peasant without a thought in hishead, the process of reeling him in took bizarre turns.Soon after the first jolt, his benefactor gave him a second one by showing donJuan his ability to transform himself. One day his benefactor became a youngman. Don Juan was incapable of conceiving of this transformation as anything butan example of a consummate actor's art.\"How did he accomplish those changes?\" I asked.\"He was both a magician and an artist,\" don Juan replied. \"His magic was that hetransformed himself by moving his assemblage point into the position that wouldbring on whatever particular change he desired. And his art was the perfectionof his transformations.\"\"I don't quite understand what you're telling me,\" I said.Don Juan said that perception is the hinge for everything man is or does, andthat perception is ruled by the location of the assemblage point. Therefore, ifthat point changes positions, man's perception of the world changes accordingly.The sorcerer who knew exactly where to place his assemblage point could becomeanything he wanted.\"The nagual Julian's proficiency in moving his assemblage point was somagnificent that he could elicit the subtlest transformations,\" don Juancontinued. \"When a sorcerer becomes a crow, for instance, it is definitely agreat accomplishment. But it entails a vast and therefore a gross shift of theassemblage point. However, moving it to the position of a fat man, or an oldman, requires the minutest shift and the keenest knowledge of human nature.\"\"I'd rather avoid thinking or talking about those things as facts,\" I said.Don Juan laughed as if I had said the funniest thing imaginable.\"Was there a reason for your benefactor's transformations?\" I asked. \"Or was hejust amusing himself?\"\"Don't be stupid. Warriors don't do anything just to amuse themselves,\" hereplied. \"His transformations were strategical. They were dictated by need; likehis transformation from old to young. Now and then there were funnyconsequences, but that's another matter.\"I reminded him that I had asked before how his benefactor learned thosetransformations. He had told me then that his benefactor had a teacher, butwould not tell me who.\"That very mysterious sorcerer who is our ward taught him,\" don Juan repliedcurtly.\"What mysterious sorcerer is that?\" I asked.\"The death defier,\" he said and looked at me questioningly.For all the sorcerers of don Juan's party, the death defier was a most vividcharacter. According to them, the death defier was a sorcerer of ancient times.He had succeeded in surviving to the present day by manipulating his assemblagepoint; making it move in specific ways to specific locations within his totalenergy field. Such maneuvers had permitted his awareness and life force topersist.Don Juan had told me about the agreement that the seers of his lineage hadentered into with the death defier centuries before. He made gifts to them inexchange for vital energy. Because of this agreement, they considered him theirward and called him 'the tenant'.Don Juan had explained that sorcerers of ancient times were experts at makingthe assemblage point move. In doing so they had discovered extraordinary thingsabout perception, but they had also discovered how easy it was to get lost inaberration. The death defier's situation was for don Juan a classic example ofan aberration.Don Juan used to repeat every chance he could that if the assemblage point waspushed by someone who not only saw it but also had enough energy to move it, itslid within the luminous ball to whatever location the pusher directed. Itsbrilliance was enough to light up the threadlike energy fields it touched. Theresulting perception of the world was as complete as, but not the same as, ournormal perception of everyday life. Therefore, sobriety was crucial to dealingwith the moving of the assemblage point.Continuing his story, don Juan said that he quickly became accustomed tothinking of the old man who had saved his life as really a young manmasquerading as old. But one day the young man was again the old Belisario donJuan had first met. He and the woman don Juan thought was his wife packed theirbags, and two smiling men with a team of mules appeared out of nowhere.Don Juan laughed, savoring his story. He said that while the muleteers packedthe mules, Belisario pulled him aside and pointed out that he and his wife wereagain disguised.He was again an old man, and his beautiful wife was a fat irascible Indian.\"I was so young and stupid that only the obvious had value for me,\" don Juancontinued. \"Just a couple of days before, I had seen his incredibletransformation from a feeble man in his seventies to a vigorous young man in hismid-twenties, and I took his word that old age was just a disguise. His wife hadalso changed from a sour, fat Indian to a beautiful slender young woman. Thewoman, of course, hadn't transformed herself the way my benefactor had. He hadsimply changed the woman. Of course, I could have seen everything at that time,but wisdom always comes to us painfully and in driblets.\"Don Juan said that the old man assured him that his wound was healed although hedid not feel quite well yet. He then embraced don Juan and in a truly sad voicewhispered, \"the monster has liked you so much that he has released me and mywife from bondage and taken you as his sole servant.\"\"I would have laughed at him,\" don Juan went on, \"had it not been for a deepanimal growling and a frightening rattle that came from the monster's rooms.\"Don Juan's eyes were shining with inner delight. I wanted to remain serious, butcould not help laughing.Belisario, aware of don Juan's fright, apologized profusely for the twist offate that had liberated him and imprisoned don Juan. He clicked his tongue indisgust and cursed the monster. He had tears in his eyes when he listed all thechores the monster wanted done daily. And when don Juan protested, he confided,in low tones, that there was no way to escape, because the monster's knowledgeof witchcraft was unequaled.Don Juan asked Belisario to recommend some line of action. And Belisario wentinto a long explanation about plans of action being appropriate only if one weredealing with average human beings. In the human context, we can plan and plot;and depending on luck plus our cunning and dedication, we can succeed. But inthe face of the unknown, specifically don Juan's situation, the only hope ofsurvival was to acquiesce and understand.Belisario confessed to don Juan in a barely audible murmur that to make sure themonster never came after him, he was going to the state of Durango to learnsorcery. He asked don Juan if he too would consider learning sorcery. And donJuan, horrified at the thought, said that he would have nothing to do withwitches. Don Juan held his sides laughing and admitted that he enjoyed thinking about howhis benefactor must have relished their interplay; especially when don Juan, ina frenzy of fear and passion, rejected the bona fide invitation to learnsorcery, saying, \"I am an Indian. I was born to hate and fear witches.\"Belisario exchanged looks with his wife and his body began to convulse. Don Juanrealized he was weeping silently, obviously hurt by the rejection. His wife hadto prop him up until he regained his composure.As Belisario and his wife were walking away, he turned and gave don Juan onemore piece of advice. He said that the monster abhorred women, and don Juanshould be on the lookout for a male replacement on the off chance that themonster would like him enough to switch slaves. But he should not raise hishopes, because it was going to be years before he could even leave the house.The monster liked to make sure his slaves were loyal or at least obedient.Don Juan could stand it no longer. He broke down, began to weep, and toldBelisario that no one was going to enslave him. He could always kill himself.The old man was very moved by don Juan's outburst and confessed that he had hadthe same idea, but, alas, the monster was able to read his thoughts and hadprevented him from taking his own life every time he had tried.Belisario made another offer to take don Juan with him to Durango to learnsorcery. He said it was the only possible solution. And don Juan told him hissolution was like jumping from the frying pan into the fire.Belisario began to weep loudly and embraced don Juan. Belisario cursed themoment he had saved the don Juan's life and swore that he had no idea they wouldtrade places. He blew his nose, and looking at don Juan with burning eyes, said,\"Disguise is the only way to survive. If you don't behave properly, the monstercan steal your soul and turn you into an idiot who does his chores, and nothingmore. Too bad I don't have time to teach you acting.\" Then he wept even more.Don Juan, choking with tears asked him to describe how he could disguisehimself. Belisario confided that the monster had terrible eyesight, andrecommended that don Juan experiment with various clothes that suited his fancy.He had, after all, years ahead of him to try different disguises. He embraceddon Juan at the door, weeping openly. His wife touched don Juan's hand shyly.And then they were gone.\"Never in my life, before or after, have I felt such terror and despair,\" donJuan said. \"The monster rattled things inside the house as if he were waitingimpatiently for me. I sat down by the door and whined like a dog in pain. Then Ivomited from sheer fear.\"Don Juan sat for hours incapable of moving. He dared not leave, nor did he darego inside. It was no exaggeration to say that he was actually about to die whenhe saw Belisario waving his arms, frantically trying to catch his attention fromthe other side of the street. Just seeing him again gave don Juan instantaneousrelief. Belisario was squatting by the sidewalk watching the house. He signaleddon Juan to stay put.After an excruciatingly long time, Belisario crawled a few feet on his hands andknees toward don Juan, then squatted again, totally immobile. Crawling in thatfashion, he advanced until he was at don Juan's side. It took him hours. A lotof people had passed by, but no one seemed to have noticed don Juan's despair orthe old man's actions. When the two of them were side by side, Belisariowhispered that he had not felt right leaving don Juan like a dog tied to a post.His wife had objected, but he had returned to attempt to rescue him. After all,it was thanks to don Juan that he had gained his freedom.He asked don Juan in a commanding whisper whether he was ready and willing to doanything to escape this. And don Juan assured him that he would do anything. Inthe most surreptitious [* surreptitious- marked by quiet and caution andsecrecy; taking pains to avoid being observed] manner, Belisario handed don Juana bundle of clothes. Then he outlined his plan.Don Juan was to go to the area of the house farthest from the monster's roomsand slowly change his clothes, taking off one item of clothing at a time,starting with his hat, leaving the shoes for last. Then he was to put all hisclothes on a wooden frame, a mannequin-like structure he was to build,efficiently and quickly, as soon as he was inside the house. The next step ofthe plan was for don Juan to put on the only disguise that could fool themonster: the clothes in the bundle.Don Juan ran into the house and got everything ready. He built a scarecrow-likeframe with poles he found in the back of the house, took off his clothes and putthem on it. But when he opened the bundle he got the surprise of his life. Thebundle consisted of women's clothes!\"I felt stupid and lost,\" don Juan said, \"and was just about to put my ownclothes back on when I heard the inhuman growls of that monstrous man. I hadbeen reared to despise women; to believe their only function was to take care ofmen. Putting on women's clothes to me was tantamount to becoming a woman. But myfear of the monster was so intense that I closed my eyes and put on the damnedclothes.\"I looked at don Juan; imagining him in women's clothes. It was an image soutterly ridiculous that against my will I broke into a belly laugh.Don Juan said that when old Belisario, waiting for him across the street, sawdon Juan in disguise, he began to weep uncontrollably. Weeping, he guided donJuan to the outskirts of town where his wife was waiting with the two muleteers.One of them very daringly asked Belisario if he was stealing the weird girl tosell her to a whorehouse. The old man wept so hard he seemed on the verge offainting. The young muleteers did not know what to do, but Belisario's wife,instead of commiserating, [* commiserating- to feel or express sympathy orcompassion] began to scream with laughter. And don Juan could not understandwhy.The party began to move in the dark. They took little-traveled trails and movedsteadily north. Belisario did not speak much. He seemed to be frightened andexpecting trouble. His wife fought with him all the time and complained thatthey had thrown away their chance for freedom by taking don Juan along.Belisario gave her strict orders not to mention it again for fear the muleteerswould discover that don Juan was in disguise.Belisario cautioned don Juan that because he did not know how to behaveconvincingly like a woman, he should act as if he were a girl who was a littletouched in the head.Within a few days don Juan's fear subsided a great deal. In fact, he became soconfident that he could not even remember having been afraid. If it had not beenfor the clothes he was wearing, he could have imagined the whole experience hadbeen a bad dream.Wearing women's clothes under those conditions entailed, of course, a series ofdrastic changes. Belisario's wife coached don Juan with true seriousness inevery aspect of being a woman. Don Juan helped her cook, wash clothes, andgather firewood.Belisario shaved don Juan's head and put a strong-smelling medicine on it, andtold the muleteers that the girl had had an infestation of lice. Don Juan saidthat since he was still a beardless youth it was not really difficult to pass asa woman. But he felt disgusted with himself, and with all those people, andabove all, with his fate. To end up wearing women's clothes and doing women'schores was more than he could bear.One day he had enough. The muleteers were the final straw. They expected anddemanded that this strange girl wait on them hand and foot. Don Juan said thathe also had to be on permanent guard because they would make passes.I felt compelled to ask a question.\"Were the muleteers in cahoots with your benefactor? I asked.\"No,\" he replied and began to laugh uproariously. \"They were just two nicepeople who had fallen temporarily under his spell. He had hired their mules tocarry medicinal plants and told them that he would pay handsomely if they wouldhelp him kidnap a young woman.\"The scope of the nagual Julian's actions staggered my imagination. I pictureddon Juan fending off sexual advances and hollered with laughter.Don Juan continued his account. He said that he told the old man sternly thatthe masquerade had lasted long enough, the men were making sexual advances.Belisario nonchalantly advised him to be more understanding because men will bemen; and then he began to weep again, completely baffling don Juan, who foundhimself furiously defending women.He was so passionate about the plight of women that he scared himself. He toldBelisario that he was going to end up in worse shape than he would have had hestayed as the monster's slave.Don Juan's turmoil increased when the old man wept uncontrollably and mumbledinanities: life was sweet, the little price one had to pay for it was a joke,the monster would devour don Juan's soul, and not even allow him to killhimself.\"Flirt with the muleteers,\" he advised don Juan in a conciliatory tone andmanner. \"They are primitive peasants. All they want is to play, so push themback when they shove you. Let them touch your leg. What do you care?\" And again,he wept unrestrainedly.Don Juan asked him why he wept like that.\"Because you are perfect for all this,\" he said and his body twisted with theforce of his sobbing.Don Juan thanked him for his good feelings and for all the trouble he was takingon his account. He told Belisario he now felt safe and wanted to leave.Belisario, paying no attention to what don Juan was telling him, said, \"The artof stalking is learning all the quirks of your disguise, and the art is to learnthem so well no one will know you are disguised. For that you need to beruthless, cunning, patient, and sweet.\"Don Juan had no idea what Belisario was talking about. Rather than finding out,he asked him for some men's clothes. Belisario was very understanding. He gavedon Juan some old clothes and a few pesos. He promised don Juan that hisdisguise would always be there in case he needed it, and pressed him vehementlyto come to Durango with him to learn sorcery and free himself from the monsterfor good. Don Juan said no and thanked him. So Belisario bid him goodbye andpatted him on the back repeatedly and with considerable force.Don Juan changed his clothes and asked Belisario for directions. He answeredthat if don Juan followed the trail north, sooner or later he would reach thenext town. He said that the two of them might even cross paths again since theywere all going in the same general direction- away from the monster.Don Juan took off as fast as he could, free at last. He must have walked four orfive miles before he found signs of people. He knew that a town was nearby andthought that perhaps he could get work there until he decided where he wasgoing.He sat down to rest for a moment, anticipating the normal difficulties astranger would find in a small out of the way town, when from the corner of hiseye he saw a movement in the bushes by the mule trail. He felt someone waswatching him. He became so thoroughly terrified that he jumped up and started torun in the direction of the town: The monster jumped at him lurching out to grabhis neck. He missed by an inch. Don Juan screamed as he had never screamedbefore, but still had enough self-control to turn and run back in the directionfrom which he had come.While don Juan ran for his life, the monster pursued him, crashing through thebushes only a few feet away. Don Juan said that it was the most frighteningsound he had ever heard. Finally he saw the mules moving slowly in the distance,and he yelled for help.Belisario recognized don Juan and ran toward him displaying overt terror. Hethrew the bundle of women's clothes at don Juan shouting, \"Run like a woman, youfool.\"Don Juan admitted that he did not know how he had the presence of mind to runlike a woman, but he did it. The monster stopped chasing him. And Belisario toldhim to change quickly while he held the monster at bay.Don Juan joined Belisario's wife and the smiling muleteers without looking atanybody. They doubled back and took other trails. Nobody spoke for days.Then Belisario gave him daily lessons. He told don Juan that Indian women werepractical and went directly to the heart of things, but that they were also veryshy. When challenged, they showed the physical signs of fright in shifty eyes,tight mouths, and enlarged nostrils. All these signs were accompanied by afearful stubbornness, followed by shy laughter.Belisario made don Juan practice his womanly behavior skills in every town theypassed through. Don Juan honestly believed he was teaching him to be an actor.But his benefactor insisted that he was teaching him the art of stalking. Hetold don Juan that stalking was an art applicable to everything, and that therewere four steps to learning it: ruthlessness, cunning, patience, and sweetness.I felt compelled to interrupt his account once more.\"But isn't stalking taught in deep, heightened awareness?\" I asked.\"Of course,\" he replied with a grin. \"But you have to understand that for somemen wearing women's clothes is the door into heightened awareness. In fact, suchmeans are more effective than pushing the assemblage point, but are verydifficult to arrange.\"Don Juan said that his benefactor drilled him daily in the four moods ofstalking and insisted that don Juan understand that ruthlessness should not beharshness, cunning should not be cruelty, patience should not be negligence, andsweetness should not be foolishness.Belisario taught him that these four steps had to be practiced and perfecteduntil they were so smooth they were unnoticeable. His benefactor believed womento be natural stalkers, and his conviction was so strong that he maintained thatonly in a woman's disguise could any man really learn the art of stalking.\"I went with him to every market in every town we passed and haggled witheveryone,\" don Juan went on. \"My benefactor used to stay to one side watchingme. 'Be ruthless but charming,' he used to say. 'Be cunning but nice. Be patientbut active. Be sweet but lethal. Only women can do it. If a man acts this wayhe's being prissy.' \"And as if to make sure don Juan stayed in line, the monstrous man appeared fromtime to time. Don Juan caught sight of him, roaming the countryside. He wouldsee him most often after Belisario gave him a vigorous back massage, supposedlyto alleviate a sharp nervous pain in his neck. Don Juan laughed and said that hehad no idea he was being manipulated into heightened awareness.\"It took us one month to reach the city of Durango,\" don Juan said. \"In thatmonth, I had a brief sample of the four moods of stalking. It really didn'tchange me much, but it gave me a chance to have an inkling of what being a womanwas like.\"================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Four Moods of StalkingDon Juan said that I should sit there at that ancient lookout post and use thepull of the earth to move my assemblage point and recall other states ofheightened awareness in which he had taught me stalking.\"In the past few days, I have mentioned many times the four moods of stalking,\"he went on. \"I have mentioned ruthlessness, cunning, patience, and sweetnesswith the hope that you might remember what I taught you about them. It would bewonderful if you could use these four moods as the ushers to bring you into atotal recollection.\"He kept quiet for what seemed an inordinately long moment. Then he made astatement which should not have surprised me, but did. He said he had taught methe four moods of stalking in northern Mexico with the help of Vicerite Medranoand Silvio Manuel. He did not elaborate but let his statement sink in. I triedto remember but finally gave up and wanted to shout that I could not remembersomething that never happened.As I was struggling to voice my protest, anxious thoughts began to cross mymind. I knew don Juan had not said what he had just to annoy me. As I always didwhen asked to remember heightened awareness, I became obsessively conscious thatthere was really no continuity to the events I had experienced under hisguidance. Those events were not strung together as the events in my daily lifewere, in a linear sequence. It was perfectly possible he was right. In donJuan's world, I had no business being certain of anything.I tried to voice my doubts but he refused to listen and urged me to recollect.By then it was quite dark. It had gotten windy, but I did not feel the cold. DonJuan had given me a flat rock to place on my sternum. My awareness was keenlytuned to everything around.I felt an abrupt pull, which was neither external nor internal, but rather thesensation of a sustained tugging at an unidentifiable part of myself. Suddenly Ibegan to remember with shattering clarity a meeting I had had years before. Iremembered events and people so vividly that it frightened me. I felt a chill.I told all this to don Juan, who did not seem impressed or concerned. He urgedme not to give in to mental or physical fear. My recollection was so phenomenalthat it was as if I were reliving the experience. Don Juan kept quiet. He didnot even look at me. I felt numbed. The sensation of numbness passed slowly.I repeated the same things I always said to don Juan when I remembered an eventwith no linear existence.\"How can this be, don Juan? How could I have forgotten all this?\"And he reaffirmed the same things he always did.\"This type of remembering or forgetting has nothing to do with normal memory,\"he assured me. \"It has to do with the movement of the assemblage point.\"He affirmed that although I possessed total knowledge of what intent is, I didnot command that knowledge yet. Knowing what intent is means that one can, atany time, explain that knowledge or use it. A nagual by the force of hisposition is obliged to command his knowledge in this manner.\"What did you recollect?\" he asked me.\"The first time you told me about the four moods of stalking,\" I said.Some process, inexplicable in terms of my usual awareness of the world, hadreleased a memory which a minute before had not existed; and I recollected anentire sequence of events that had happened many years before. Just as I was leaving don Juan's house in Sonora, he had asked me to meet himthe following week around noon across the U.S. border in Nogales, Arizona, inthe Greyhound bus depot.I arrived about an hour early. He was standing by the door. I greeted him. Hedid not answer but hurriedly pulled me aside and whispered that I should take myhands out of my pockets. I was dumbfounded. He did not give me time to respond.He said that my fly was open, and it was shamefully evident that I was sexuallyaroused.The speed with which I rushed to cover myself was phenomenal. By the time Irealized it was a crude joke we were on the street. Don Juan was laughing,slapping me on the back repeatedly and forcefully as if he were just celebratingthe joke. Suddenly I found myself in a state of heightened awareness.We walked into a coffee shop and sat down. My mind was so clear I wanted to lookat everything; see the essence of things.\"Don't waste energy!\" don Juan commanded in a stern voice. \"I brought you hereto discover if you can eat when your assemblage point has moved. Don't try to domore than that.\"But then a man sat down at the table in front of me, and all my attention becametrapped by him.\"Move your eyes in circles,\" don Juan commanded. \"Don't look at that man.\"I found it impossible to stop watching the man. I felt irritated by don Juan'sdemands.\"What do you see?\" I heard don Juan ask.I was seeing a luminous cocoon made of transparent wings which were folded overthe cocoon itself. The wings unfolded, fluttered for an instant, peeled off,fell, and were replaced by new wings, which repeated the same process.Don Juan boldly turned my chair until I was facing the wall.\"What a waste,\" he said in a loud sigh, after I described what I had seen. \"Youhave exhausted nearly all your energy. Restrain yourself. A warrior needs focus.Who gives a damn about wings on a luminous cocoon?\"He said that heightened awareness was like a springboard. From it one could jumpinto infinity. He stressed, over and over, that when the assemblage point wasdislodged, it either became lodged again at a position very near its customaryone or continued moving on into infinity.\"People have no idea of the strange power we carry within ourselves,\" he wenton. \"At this moment, for instance, you have the means to reach infinity. If youcontinue with your needless behavior, you may succeed in pushing your assemblagepoint beyond a certain threshold, from which there is no return.\"I understood the peril he was talking about, or rather I had the bodilysensation that I was standing on the brink of an abyss, and that if I leanedforward I would fall into it.\"Your assemblage point has moved to heightened awareness,\" he continued,\"because I have lent you my energy.\"We ate in silence- very simple food. Don Juan did not allow me to drink coffeeor tea.\"While you are using my energy,\" he said, \"you're not in your own time. You arein mine. I drink water.\"As we were walking back to my car, I felt a bit nauseous. I staggered and almostlost my balance. It was a sensation similar to that of walking while wearingglasses for the first time.\"Get hold of yourself,\" don Juan said, smiling. \"Where we're going you'll needto be extremely precise.\"He told me to drive across the international border into the twin city ofNogales, Mexico. While I was driving, he gave me directions: which street totake, when to make right or left hand turns, how fast to go.\"I know this area,\" I said quite peeved. \"Tell me where you want to go and I'lltake you there. Like a taxi driver.\"\"O.K.,\" he said. \"Take me to 1573 Heavenward Avenue.\"I did not know Heavenward Avenue, or if such a street really existed. In fact, Ihad the suspicion he had just concocted a name to embarrass me. I kept silent.There was a mocking glint in his shiny eyes.\"Egomania is a real tyrant,\" he said. \"We must work ceaselessly to dethrone it.\"He continued to tell me how to drive. Finally he asked me to stop in front of aone story, light beige house on a corner lot, in a well-to-do neighborhood.There was something about the house that immediately caught my eye: A thicklayer of ocher gravel all around it. The solid street door, the window sashes,and the house trim were all painted ocher like the gravel. All the visiblewindows had closed Venetian blinds. To all appearances it was a typical suburbanmiddle-class dwelling.We got out of the car. Don Juan led the way. He did not knock or open the doorwith a key: When we got to it, the door opened silently on oiled hinges- all byitself, as far as I could detect.Don Juan quickly entered. He did not invite me in. I just followed him. I wascurious to see who had opened the door from the inside, but there was no onethere.The interior of the house was very soothing. There were no pictures on thesmooth, scrupulously clean walls. There were no lamps or book shelves either. Agolden yellow tile floor contrasted most pleasingly with the off-white color ofthe walls.We were in a small and narrow hall that opened into a spacious living room witha high ceiling and a brick fireplace. Half the room was completely empty, butnext to the fireplace was a semicircle of expensive furniture: two large beigecouches in the middle, flanked by two armchairs covered in fabric of the samecolor. There was a heavy, round, solid oak coffee table in the center.Judging from what I was seeing around the house, the people who lived thereappeared to be well off, but frugal. And they obviously liked to sit around thefire.Two men, perhaps in their mid-fifties, sat in the armchairs. They stood when weentered. One of them was Indian, the other Latin American. Don Juan introducedme first to the Indian, who was nearer to me.\"This is Silvio Manuel,\" don Juan said to me. \"He's the most powerful anddangerous sorcerer of my party, and the most mysterious too.\"Silvio Manuel's features were out of a Mayan fresco. His complexion was pale,almost yellow. I thought he looked Chinese. His eyes were slanted, but withoutthe epicanthic fold. They were big, black, and brilliant. He was beardless. Hishair was jet-black with specks of gray in it. He had high cheekbones and fulllips. He was perhaps five feet seven, thin, wiry, and he wore a yellow sportshirt, brown slacks, and a thin beige jacket. Judging from his clothes andgeneral mannerisms, he seemed to be Mexican-American.I smiled and extended my hand to Silvio Manuel, but he did not take it. Henodded perfunctorily.\"And this is Vicente Medrano,\" don Juan said, turning to the other man. \"He'sthe most knowledgeable and the oldest of my companions. He is oldest not interms of age, but because he was my benefactor's first disciple.\"Vicente nodded just as perfunctorily as Silvio Manuel had, and also did not saya word.He was a bit taller than Silvio Manuel, but just as lean. He had a pinkishcomplexion and a neatly trimmed beard and mustache. His features were almostdelicate: a thin, beautifully chiseled nose, a small mouth, thin lips. Bushy,dark eyebrows contrasted with his graying beard and hair. His eyes were brownand also brilliant and laughed in spite of his frowning expression. He wasconservatively dressed in a greenish seersucker suit and open-collared sportshirt. He too seemed to be Mexican-American. I guessed him to be the owner ofthe house.In contrast, don Juan looked like an Indian peon. His straw hat, his worn-outshoes, his old khaki pants and plaid shirt were those of a gardener or ahandyman.The impression I had, upon seeing all three of them together, was that don Juanwas in disguise. The military image came to me that don Juan was the commandingofficer of a clandestine operation; an officer who, no matter how hard he tried,could not hide his years of command.I also had the feeling that they must all have been around the same age,although don Juan looked much older than the other two, yet seemed infinitelystronger.\"I think you already know that Carlos is by far the biggest indulger I have evermet,\" don Juan told them with a most serious expression. \"Bigger even than ourbenefactor. I assure you that if there is someone who takes indulging seriously,this is the man.\"I laughed, but no one else did. The two men observed me with a strange glint intheir eyes.\"For sure you'll make a memorable trio,\" don Juan continued. \"The oldest andmost knowledgeable, the most dangerous and powerful, and the mostself-indulgent.\"They still did not laugh. They scrutinized me until I became self-conscious.Then Vicente broke the silence.\"I don't know why you brought him inside the house,\" he said in a dry, cuttingtone. \"He's of little use to us. Put him out in the backyard.\"\"And tie him,\" Silvio Manuel added.Don Juan turned to me. \"Come on,\" he said in a soft voice and pointed with aquick sideways movement of his head to the back of the house.It was more than obvious that the two men did not like me. I did not know whatto say. I was definitely angry and hurt, but those feelings were somehowdeflected by my state of heightened awareness.We walked into the backyard. Don Juan casually picked up a leather rope andtwirled it around my neck with tremendous speed. His movements were so fast andso nimble that an instant later, before I could realize what was happening, Iwas tied at the neck, like a dog, to one of the two cinder-block columnssupporting the heavy roof over the back porch.Don Juan shook his head from side to side in a gesture of resignation ordisbelief and went back into the house as I began to yell at him to untie me.The rope was so tight around my neck it prevented me from screaming as loud as Iwould have liked.I could not believe what was taking place. Containing my anger, I tried to undothe knot at my neck. It was so compact that the leather strands seemed gluedtogether. I hurt my nails trying to pull them apart.I had an attack of uncontrollable wrath and growled like an impotent animal.Then I grabbed the rope, twisted it around my forearms, and bracing my feetagainst the cinder-block column, pulled. But the leather was too tough for thestrength of my muscles.I felt humiliated and scared. Fear brought me a moment of sobriety. I knew I hadlet don Juan's false aura of reasonableness deceive me. I assessed my situationas objectively as I could and saw no way to escape except by cutting the leatherrope. I frantically began to rub it against the sharp corner of the cinder-blockcolumn. I thought that if I could rip the rope before any of the men came to theback, I had a chance to run to my car and take off, never to return.I puffed and sweated and rubbed the rope until I had nearly worn it through.Then I braced one foot against the column, wrapped the rope around my forearmsagain, and pulled it desperately until it snapped, throwing me back into thehouse.As I crashed backward through the open door, don Juan, Vicente, and SilvioManuel were standing in the middle of the room, applauding.\"What a dramatic reentry,\" Vicente said, helping me up. \"You fooled me. I didn'tthink you were capable of such explosions.\"Don Juan came to me and snapped the knot open, freeing my neck from the piece ofrope around it.I was shaking with fear, exertion, and anger. In a faltering voice, I asked donJuan why he was tormenting me like this. The three of them laughed and at thatmoment seemed the farthest thing from threatening.\"We wanted to test you and find out what sort of a man you really are,\" don Juansaid.He led me to one of the couches and politely offered me a seat. Vicente andSilvio Manuel sat in the armchairs, don Juan sat facing me on the other couch.I laughed nervously but was no longer apprehensive about my situation, nor aboutdon Juan and his friends. All three regarded me with frank curiosity. Vicentecould not stop smiling, although he seemed to be trying desperately to appearserious. Silvio Manuel shook his head rhythmically as he stared at me. His eyeswere unfocused but fixed on me.\"We tied you down,\" don Juan went on, \"because we wanted to know whether you aresweet or patient or ruthless or cunning. We found out you are none of thosethings. Rather you're a king-sized indulger, just as I had said.\"If you hadn't indulged in being violent, you would certainly have noticed thatthe formidable knot in the rope around your neck was a fake. It snaps. Vicentedesigned that knot to fool his friends.\"\"You tore the rope violently. You're certainly not sweet,\" Silvio Manuel said.They were all quiet for a moment, then began to laugh.\"You're neither ruthless nor cunning,\" don Juan went on. \"If you were, you wouldeasily have snapped open both knots and run away with a valuable leather rope.You're not patient either. If you were, you would have whined and cried untilyou realized that there was a pair of clippers by the wall with which you couldhave cut the rope in two seconds and saved yourself all the agony and exertion.\"You can't be taught, then, to be violent or obtuse. You already are that. Butyou can learn to be ruthless, cunning, patient, and sweet.\"Don Juan explained to me that ruthlessness, cunning, patience, and sweetnesswere the essence of stalking. They were the basics that with all theirramifications had to be taught in careful, meticulous steps.He was definitely addressing me, but he talked looking at Vicente and SilvioManuel, who listened with utmost attention and shook their heads in agreementfrom time to time.He stressed repeatedly that teaching stalking was one of the most difficultthings sorcerers did. He insisted that no matter what they themselves did toteach me stalking- and no matter what I believed to the contrary- it wasimpeccability which dictated their acts.\"Rest assured we know what we're doing. Our benefactor, the nagual Julian, sawto it,\" don Juan said, and all three of them broke into such uproarious laughterthat I felt quite uncomfortable. I did not know what to think.Don Juan reiterated that a very important point to consider was that, to anonlooker, the behavior of sorcerers might appear malicious, when in realitytheir behavior was always impeccable.\"How can you tell the difference, if you're at the receiving end?\" I asked.\"Malicious acts are performed by people for personal gain,\" he said. \"Sorcerers,though, have an ulterior purpose for their acts which has nothing to do withpersonal gain. The fact that they enjoy their acts does not count as gain.Rather, it is a condition of their character. The average man acts only if thereis the chance for profit. Warriors say they act not for profit but for thespirit.\"I thought about it. Acting without considering gain was truly an alien concept.I had been reared to invest and to hope for some kind of reward for everything Idid.Don Juan must have taken my silence and thoughtfulness as skepticism. He laughedand looked at his two companions.\"Take the four of us as an example,\" he went on. \"You, yourself, believe thatyou're investing in this situation and eventually you are going to profit fromit. If you get angry with us, or if we disappoint you, you may resort tomalicious acts to get even with us. We, on the contrary, have no thought ofpersonal gain. Our acts are dictated by impeccability. We can't be angry ordisillusioned with you.\"Don Juan smiled and told me that from the moment we had met at the bus depotthat very day, everything he had done to me, although it might not have seemedso, was dictated by impeccability. He explained that he needed to get me into anunguarded position to help me enter heightened awareness. It was to that endthat he had told me my fly was open.\"It was a way of jolting you,\" he said with a grin. \"We are crude Indians, soall our jolts are somehow primitive. The more sophisticated the warrior, thegreater his finesse and elaboration of his jolts. But I have to admit we got abig kick out of our crudeness, especially when we tied you at the neck like adog.\"The three of them grinned and then laughed quietly as if there was someone elseinside the house whom they did not want to disturb.In a very low voice don Juan said that because I was in a state of heightenedawareness, I could understand more readily what he was going to tell me aboutthe two masteries of stalking and intent.He called them the crowning glory of sorcerers old and new; the very thingsorcerers were concerned with today, just as sorcerers had been thousands ofyears before. He asserted that stalking was the beginning, and that beforeanything could be attempted on the warrior's path, warriors must learn to stalk;next they must learn to intend; and only then could they move their assemblagepoint at will.I knew exactly what he was talking about. I knew, without knowing how, whatmoving the assemblage point could accomplish. But I did not have the words toexplain what I knew. I tried repeatedly to voice my knowledge to them. Theylaughed at my failures and coaxed me to try again.\"How would you like it if I articulate it for you?\" don Juan asked. \"I might beable to find the very words you want to use but can't.\"From his look, I decided he was seriously asking my permission. I found thesituation so incongruous that I began to laugh.Don Juan, displaying great patience, asked me again, and I got another attack oflaughter. Their look of surprise and concern told me my reaction wasincomprehensible to them. Don Juan got up and announced that I was too tired andit was time for me to return to the world of ordinary affairs.\"Wait, wait,\" I pleaded. \"I am all right. I just find it funny that you shouldbe asking me to give you permission.\"\"I have to ask your permission,\" don Juan said, \"because you're the only one whocan allow the words pent up inside you to be tapped. I think I made the mistakeof assuming you understand more than you do. Words are tremendously powerful andimportant, and are the magical property of whoever has them.\"Sorcerers have a rule of thumb: They say that the deeper the assemblage pointmoves, the greater the feeling that one has knowledge and no words to explainit. Sometimes the assemblage point of average persons can move without a knowncause and without their being aware of it, except that they become tongue-tied,confused, and evasive.\"Vicente interrupted and suggested I stay with them a while longer. Don Juanagreed and turned to face me.\"The very first principle of stalking is that a warrior stalks himself,\" hesaid. \"He stalks himself ruthlessly, cunningly, patiently, and sweetly.\"I wanted to laugh, but he did not give me time. Very succinctly he definedstalking as the art of using behavior in novel ways for specific purposes. Hesaid that normal human behavior in the world of everyday life was routine. Anybehavior that broke from routine caused an unusual effect on our total being.That unusual effect was what sorcerers sought, because it was cumulative.He explained that the sorcerer seers of ancient times, through their seeing, hadfirst noticed that unusual behavior produced a tremor in the assemblage point.They soon discovered that if unusual behavior was practiced systematically anddirected wisely, it eventually forced the assemblage point to move.\"The real challenge for those sorcerer seers,\" don Juan went on, \"was finding asystem of behavior that was neither petty nor capricious, but that combined themorality and the sense of beauty which differentiates sorcerer seers from plainwitches.\"He stopped talking, and they all looked at me as if searching for signs offatigue in my eyes or face.\"Anyone who succeeds in moving his assemblage point to a new position is asorcerer,\" don Juan continued. \"And from that new position, he can do all kindsof good and bad things to his fellow men. Being a sorcerer, therefore, can belike being a cobbler or a baker. The quest of sorcerer seers is to go beyondthat stand. And to do that, they need morality and beauty.\"He said that for sorcerers stalking was the foundation on which everything elsethey did was built.\"Some sorcerers object to the term stalking,\" he went on, \"but the name cameabout because it entails surreptitious [* surreptitious- marked by quiet andcaution and secrecy; taking pains to avoid being observed] behavior.\"It's also called the art of stealth, but that term is equally unfortunate. Weourselves, because of our nonmilitant temperament, call it the art of controlledfolly. You can call it anything you wish. We, however, will continue with theterm stalking since it's so easy to say stalker and, as my benefactor used tosay, so awkward to say controlled folly maker.\"At the mention of their benefactor, they laughed like children.I understood him perfectly. I had no questions or doubts. If anything, I had thefeeling that I needed to hold onto every word don Juan was saying to anchormyself. Otherwise my thoughts would have run ahead of him.I noticed that my eyes were fixed on the movement of his lips as my ears werefixed on the sound of his words. But once I realized this, I could no longerfollow him. My concentration was broken. Don Juan continued talking, but I wasnot listening.I was wondering about the inconceivable possibility of living permanently inheightened awareness. I asked myself what would the survival value be? Would onebe able to assess situations better? Be quicker than the average man, or perhapsmore intelligent?Don Juan suddenly stopped talking and asked me what I was thinking about.\"Ah, you're so very practical,\" he commented after I had told him my reveries.\"I thought that in heightened awareness your temperament was going to be moreartistic, more mystical.\"Don Juan turned to Vicente and asked him to answer my question. Vicente clearedhis throat and dried his hands by rubbing them against his thighs. He gave theclear impression of suffering from stage fright. I felt sorry for him. Mythoughts began to spin.And when I heard him stammering, an image burst into my mind- the image I hadalways had of my father's timidity; his fear of people. But before I had time tosurrender myself to that image, Vicente's eyes flared with some strange innerluminosity. He made a comically serious face at me and then spoke with authorityand in professorial manner.\"To answer your question,\" he said, \"there is no survival value in heightenedawareness; otherwise the whole human race would be there. They are safe fromthat, though, because it's so hard to get into it. There is always, however, theremote possibility that an average man might enter into such a state. If hedoes, he ordinarily succeeds in confusing himself, sometimes irreparably.\"The three of them exploded with laughter.\"Sorcerers say that heightened awareness is the portal of intent\" don Juan said.\"And they use it as such. Think about it.\"I was staring at each of them in turn. My mouth was open, and I felt that if Ikept it open I would be able to understand the riddle eventually. I closed myeyes and the answer came to me. I felt it. I did not think it. But I could notput it into words, no matter how hard I tried.\"There, there,\" don Juan said, \"you've gotten another sorcerer's answer all byyourself, but you still don't have enough energy to flatten it and turn it intowords.\"The sensation I was experiencing was more than just that of being unable tovoice my thoughts. It was like reliving something I had forgotten ages ago: notto know what I felt because I had not yet learned to speak, and therefore lackedthe resources to translate my feelings into thoughts.\"Thinking and saying exactly what you want to say requires untold amounts ofenergy,\" don Juan said and broke into my feelings.The force of my reverie had been so intense it had made me forget what hadstarted it. I stared dumbfounded at don Juan and confessed I had no idea whatthey or I had said or done just a moment before. I remembered the incident ofthe leather rope and what don Juan had told me immediately afterward, but Icould not recall the feeling that had flooded me just moments ago.\"You're going the wrong way,\" don Juan said. \"You're trying to remember thoughtsthe way you normally do, but this is a different situation. A second ago you hadan overwhelming feeling that you knew something very specific.Such feelings cannot be recollected by using memory. You have to recall them byintending them back.\"He turned to Silvio Manuel, who had stretched out in the armchair, his legsunder the coffee table. Silvio Manuel looked fixedly at me. His eyes were black,like two pieces of shiny obsidian. Without moving a muscle, he let out apiercing birdlike scream.\"Intent!!\" he yelled. \"Intent!! Intent!!\"With each scream his voice became more and more inhuman and piercing. The hairon the back of my neck stood on end. I felt goose bumps on my skin. My mind,however, instead of focusing on the fright I was experiencing, went directly torecollecting the feeling I had had. But before I could savor it completely, thefeeling expanded and burst into something else.And then I understood not only why heightened awareness was the portal ofintent, but I also understood what intent was. And, above all, I understood thatthat knowledge could not be turned into words. That knowledge was there foreveryone. It was there to be felt, to be used, but not to be explained. Onecould come into it by changing levels of awareness. Therefore, heightenedawareness was an entrance, but even the entrance could not be explained. Onecould only make use of it.There was still another piece of knowledge that came to me that day without anycoaching: that the natural knowledge of intent was available to anyone, but thecommand of it belonged to those who probed it.I was terribly tired by this time, and doubtlessly as a result of that, myCatholic upbringing came to bear heavily on my reactions. For a moment Ibelieved that intent was God.I said as much to don Juan, Vicente and Silvio Manuel. They laughed. Vicente,still in his professorial tone, said that it could not possibly be God, becauseintent was a force that could not be described, much less represented.\"Don't be presumptuous,\" don Juan said to me sternly. \"Don't try to speculate onthe basis of your first and only trial. Wait until you command your knowledge.Then decide what is what.\" Remembering the four moods of stalking exhausted me. The most dramatic resultwas a more than ordinary indifference. I would not have cared if I had droppeddead, nor if don Juan had. I did not care whether we stayed at that ancientlookout post overnight or started back in the pitch-dark.Don Juan was very understanding. He guided me by the hand, as if I were blind,to a massive rock, and helped me sit with my back to it. He recommended that Ilet natural sleep return me to a normal state of awareness. ================================================================= Part 4. The Descent of the Spirit"},{"pageContent":"Seeing the SpiritRight after a late lunch while we were still at the table, don Juan announcedthat the two of us were going to spend the night in the sorcerers' cave and thatwe had to be on our way. He said that it was imperative that I sit there againin total darkness, to allow the rock formation and the sorcerers' intent to movemy assemblage point.I started to get up from my chair, but he stopped me. He said that there wassomething he wanted to explain to me first. He stretched out, putting his feeton the seat of a chair, then leaned back into a relaxed, comfortable position.\"As I see you in greater detail,\" don Juan said, \"I notice more and more howsimilar you and my benefactor are.\"I felt so threatened that I did not let him continue. I told him that I couldnot imagine what those similarities were, but if there were any- a possibility Idid not consider reassuring- I would appreciate it if he told me about them; togive me a chance to correct or avoid them.Don Juan laughed until tears were rolling down his cheeks.\"One of the similarities is that when you act, you act very well,\" he said, \"butwhen you think, you always trip yourself up. My benefactor was like that. Hedidn't think too well.\"I was just about to defend myself, to say there was nothing wrong with mythinking, when I caught a glint of mischievousness in his eyes. I stopped cold.Don Juan noticed my shift and laughed with a note of surprise. He must have beenanticipating the opposite.\"What I mean, for instance, is that you only have problems understanding thespirit when you think about it,\" he went on with a chiding smile. \"But when youact, the spirit easily reveals itself to you. My benefactor was that way.\"Before we leave for the cave, I am going to tell you a story about mybenefactor and the fourth abstract core.\"Sorcerers believe that until the very moment of the spirit's descent, any of uscould walk away from the spirit; but not afterwards.\"Don Juan deliberately stopped to urge me with a movement of his eyebrows, toconsider what he was telling me.\"The fourth abstract core is the full brunt of the spirit's descent,\" he wenton. \"The fourth abstract core is an act of revelation. The spirit reveals itselfto us. Sorcerers describe it as the spirit lying in ambush and then descendingon us; its prey. Sorcerers say that the spirit's descent is always shrouded. Ithappens and yet it seems not to have happened at all.\"I became very nervous. Don Juan's tone of voice was giving me the feeling thathe was preparing to spring something on me at any moment.He asked me if I remembered the moment the spirit descended on me; sealing mypermanent allegiance [* allegiance- the act of binding yourself (intellectuallyor emotionally) to a course of action] to the abstract.I had no idea what he was talking about.\"There is a threshold that once crossed permits no retreat,\" he said.\"Ordinarily, from the moment the spirit knocks, it is years before an apprenticereaches that threshold. Sometimes, though, the threshold is reached almostimmediately. My benefactor's case is an example.\"Don Juan said every sorcerer should have a clear memory of crossing thatthreshold so he could remind himself of the new state of his perceptualpotential. He explained that one did not have to be an apprentice of sorcery toreach this threshold, and that the only difference between an average man and asorcerer, in such cases, is what each emphasizes. A sorcerer emphasizes crossingthis threshold and uses the memory of it as a point of reference. An average mandoes not cross the threshold and does his best to forget all about it.I told him that I did not agree with his point, because I could not accept thatthere was only one threshold to cross.Don Juan looked heavenward in dismay and shook his head in a joking gesture ofdespair. I proceeded with my argument, not to disagree with him, but to clarifythings in my mind. Yet I quickly lost my impetus. Suddenly I had the feeling Iwas sliding through a tunnel.\"Sorcerers say that the fourth abstract core happens when the spirit cuts ourchains of self-reflection,\" he said. \"Cutting our chains is marvelous, but alsovery undesirable, for nobody wants to be free.\"The sensation of sliding through a tunnel persisted for a moment longer, andthen everything became clear to me. And I began to laugh. Strange insights pentup inside me were exploding into laughter.Don Juan seemed to be reading my mind as if it were a book.\"What a strange feeling: to realize that everything we think, everything we saydepends on the position of the assemblage point,\" he remarked.And that was exactly what I had been thinking and laughing about.\"I know that at this moment your assemblage point has shifted,\" he went on, \"andyou have understood the secret of our chains. They imprison us. But by keepingus pinned down on our comfortable spot of self-reflection, they defend us fromthe onslaughts of the unknown.\"I was having one of those extraordinary moments in which everything about thesorcerers' world was crystal clear. I understood everything.\"Once our chains are cut,\" don Juan continued, \"we are no longer bound by theconcerns of the daily world. We are still in the daily world, but we don'tbelong there anymore. In order to belong we must share the concerns of people,and without chains we can't.\"Don Juan said that the nagual Elias had explained to him that what distinguishesus as normal people is that we share a metaphorical dagger: the concerns of ourself-reflection. With this dagger, we cut ourselves and bleed; and the job ofour chains of self-reflection is to give us the feeling that we are bleedingtogether; that we are sharing something wonderful: our humanity. But if we wereto examine it, we would discover that we are bleeding alone; that we are notsharing anything; that all we are doing is toying with our manageable, unreal,man-made reflection.\"Sorcerers are no longer in the world of daily affairs,\" don Juan went on,\"because they are no longer prey to their self-reflection.\"Don Juan then began his story about his benefactor and the descent of thespirit. He said that the story started right after the spirit had knocked on theyoung actor's door.I interrupted don Juan and asked him why he consistently used the terms \"youngman\" or \"young actor\" to refer to the nagual Julian.\"At the time of this story, he wasn't the nagual,\" don Juan replied. \"He was ayoung actor. In my story, I can't just call him Julian, because to me he wasalways the nagual Julian. As a sign of deference for his lifetime ofimpeccabitity, we always prefix 'nagual' to a nagual's name.\"Don Juan proceeded with his story. He said that the nagual Elias had stopped theyoung actor's death by making him shift into heightened awareness, and followinghours of struggle, the young actor regained consciousness. The nagual Elias didnot mention his name, but he introduced himself as a professional healer who hadstumbled onto the scene of a tragedy where two persons had nearly died.The nagual Elias pointed to the young woman, Talia, stretched out on the ground.The young man was astonished to see her lying unconscious next to him. Heremembered seeing her as she ran away. It startled him to hear the old healerexplain that doubtlessly God had punished Talia for her sins by striking herwith lightning and making her lose her mind.\"But how could there be lightning if it's not even raining?\" the young actorasked in a barely audible voice. He was visibly affected when the old Indianreplied that God's ways couldn't be questioned.Again I interrupted don Juan. I was curious to know if the young woman reallyhad lost her mind. He reminded me that the nagual Elias delivered a shatteringblow to her assemblage point. He said that she had not lost her mind, but thatas a result of the blow she slipped in and out of heightened awareness, creatinga serious threat to her health. After a gigantic struggle, however, the nagualElias helped her to stabilize her assemblage point and she entered permanentlyinto heightened awareness.Don Juan commented that women are capable of such a master stroke: They canpermanently maintain a new position of their assemblage point; and Talia waspeerless. As soon as her chains were broken, she immediately understoodeverything and complied with the nagual's designs.Don Juan, recounting his story, said that the nagual Elias- who was not only asuperb dreamer, but also a superb stalker- had seen that the young actor wasspoiled and conceited, but only seemed to be hard and calloused. The nagual knewthat if he brought forth the idea of God, sin, and retribution, the actor'sreligious beliefs would make his cynical attitude collapse.Upon hearing about God's punishment, the actor's facade began to crumble. Hestarted to express remorse, but the nagual cut him short and forcefully stressedthat when death was so near, feelings of guilt no longer mattered.The young actor listened attentively, but although he felt very ill, he did notbelieve that he was in danger of dying. He thought that his weakness andfainting had been brought on by his loss of blood.As if he had read the young actor's mind, the nagual explained to him that thoseoptimistic thoughts were out of place; that his hemorrhaging would have beenfatal had it not been for the plug that he, as a healer, had created.\"When I struck your back, I put in a plug to stop the draining of your lifeforce,\" the nagual said to the skeptical young actor. \"Without that restraint,the unavoidable process of your death would continue. If you don't believe me,I'll prove it to you by removing the plug with another blow.\"As he spoke, the nagual Elias tapped the young actor on his right side by hisribcage. In a moment the young man was retching and choking. Blood poured out ofhis mouth as he coughed uncontrollably. Another tap on his back stopped theagonizing pain and retching; but it did not stop the young man's fear, and hepassed out.\"I can control your death for the time being,\" the nagual said when the youngactor regained consciousness. \"How long I can control it depends on you; on howfaithfully you acquiesce to everything I tell you to do.\"The nagual Elias said that the first requirements on the young man were totalimmobility and silence. If he did not want his plug to come out, the nagualadded, he had to behave as if he had lost his powers of motion and speech. Asingle twitch or a single utterance would be enough to restart his dying.The young actor was not accustomed to complying with suggestions or demands. Hefelt a surge of anger. As he started to voice his protest, the burning pain andconvulsions started up again.\"Stay with it, and I will cure you,\" the nagual said. \"Act like the weak, rottenimbecile you are, and you will die.\"The actor, a proud young man, was numbed by the insult. Nobody had ever calledhim a weak, rotten imbecile. He wanted to express his fury, but his pain was sosevere that he could not react to the indignity.\"If you want me to ease your pain, you must obey me blindly,\" the nagual saidwith frightening coldness. \"Signal me with a nod. But know now that the momentyou change your mind and act like the shameful moron you are, I'll immediatelypull the plug and leave you to die.\"With his last bit of strength the actor nodded his assent. The nagual tapped himon his back and his pain vanished. But along with the searing pain, somethingelse vanished: the fog in his mind. And then the young actor knew everythingwithout understanding anything. The nagual introduced himself again. He told himthat his name was Elias, and that he was the nagual. And the actor knew what itall meant.The nagual Elias then shifted his attention to the semiconscious Talia. He puthis mouth to her left ear and whispered commands to her in order to make herassemblage point stop its erratic shifting. He soothed her fear by telling her,in whispers, stories of sorcerers who had gone through the same thing she wasexperiencing. When she was fairly calm, he introduced himself as the nagualElias, a sorcerer; and then he attempted with her the most difficult thing insorcery: moving the assemblage point beyond the sphere of the world we know.Don Juan remarked that seasoned sorcerers are capable of moving beyond the worldwe know, but that inexperienced persons are not. The nagual Elias alwaysmaintained that ordinarily he would not have dreamed of attempting such a feat,but on that day something other than his knowledge or his volition was makinghim act. Yet the maneuver worked. Talia moved beyond the world we know and camesafely back.Then the nagual Elias had another insight. The actor was naked; covered only bythe nagual Elfas's riding coat. As the nagual Elias sat between the two peoplestretched out on the ground, he reviewed their situation to them.He told them they had both, by the force of circumstances, fallen into a trapset by the spirit itself. He, the nagual, was the active part of that trapbecause by encountering them under the conditions he had, he had been forced tobecome their temporary protector; and to engage his knowledge of sorcery inorder to help them.As their temporary protector it was his duty to warn them that they were aboutto reach a unique threshold; and that it was up to them, both individually andtogether, to attain that threshold by entering a mood of abandon but notrecklessness; a mood of caring but not indulgence. He did not want to say morefor fear of confusing them or influencing their decision. He felt that if theywere to cross that threshold, it had to be with minimal help from him.The nagual then left them alone in that isolated spot and went to the city toarrange for medicinal herbs, mats, and blankets to be brought to them. His ideawas that in solitude they would attain and cross that threshold. For a long time the two young people lay next to each other, immersed in theirown thoughts. The fact that their assemblage points had shifted meant that theycould think in greater depth than ordinarily, but it also meant that theyworried, pondered, and were afraid in equally greater depth.Since Talia could talk and was a bit stronger. She broke their silence: Sheasked the young actor if he was afraid. He nodded affirmatively. She felt agreat compassion for him and took off a shawl she was wearing to put over hisshoulders, and she held his hand.The young man did not dare voice what he felt. His fear that his pain wouldrecur if he spoke was too great and too vivid. He wanted to apologize to her; totell her that his only regret was having hurt her, and that it did not matterthat he was going to die- for he knew with certainty that he was not going tosurvive the day.Talia's thoughts were on the same subject. She said that she too had only oneregret: that she had fought him hard enough to bring on his death. She was verypeaceful now, a feeling which, agitated as she always was and driven by hergreat strength, was unfamiliar to her. She told him that her death was verynear, too, and that she was glad it all would end that day.The young actor, hearing his own thoughts being spoken by Talia, felt a chill. Asurge of energy came to him then and made him sit up. He was not in pain, norwas he coughing. He took in great gulps of air, something he had no memory ofhaving done before. He took the girl's hand and they began to talk withoutvocalizing.Don Juan said it was at that instant that the spirit came to them. And they'saw'. They were deeply Catholic, and what they saw was a vision of heaven whereeverything was alive; bathed in light. They saw a world of miraculous sights.When the nagual returned, they were exhausted, although not injured. Talia wasunconscious, but the young man had managed to remain aware by a supreme effortof self-control. He insisted on whispering something in the nagual's ear.\"We saw heaven,\" he whispered, tears rolling down his cheeks.\"You saw more than that,\" the nagual Elfas retorted. \"You saw the spirit.\"Don Juan said that since the spirit's descent is always shrouded, naturally,Talia and the young actor could not hold onto their vision. They soon forgot it,as anyone would. The uniqueness of their experience was that, without anytraining and without being aware of it, they had dreamed together and had seenthe spirit. For them to have achieved this with such ease was quite out of theordinary.\"Those two were really the most remarkable beings I have ever met,\" don Juanadded.I, naturally, wanted to know more about them. But don Juan would not indulge me.He said that this was all there was about his benefactor and the fourth abstractcore.He seemed to remember something he was not telling me and laughed uproariously.Then he patted me on the back and told me it was time to set out for the cave. When we got to the rock ledge it was almost dark. Don Juan sat down hurriedly,in the same position as the first time. He was to my right, touching me with hisshoulder. He immediately seemed to enter into a deep state of relaxation, whichpulled me into total immobility and silence. I could not even hear hisbreathing. I closed my eyes, but he nudged me to warn me to keep them open.By the time it became completely dark, an immense fatigue had begun to make myeyes sore and itchy. Finally I gave up my resistance and was pulled into thedeepest, blackest sleep I have ever had. Yet I was not totally asleep. I couldfeel the thick blackness around me. I had an entirely physical sensation ofwading through blackness. Then it suddenly became reddish, then orange, thenglaring white, like a terribly strong neon light.Gradually I focused my vision until I saw I was still sitting in the sameposition with don Juan- but no longer in the cave. We were on a mountaintoplooking down over exquisite flatlands with mountains in the distance. Thisbeautiful prairie was bathed in a glow that, like rays of light, emanated fromthe land itself. Wherever I looked, I saw familiar features: rocks, hills,rivers, forests, canyons, enhanced and transformed by their inner vibration;their inner glow. This glow that was so pleasing to my eyes also tingled out ofmy very being.\"Your assemblage point has moved,\" don Juan seemed to say to me.The words had no sound; nevertheless I knew what he had just said to me. Myrational reaction was to try to explain to myself that I had no doubt heard himas I would have if he had been talking in a vacuum, probably because my ears hadbeen temporarily affected by what was transpiring.\"Your ears are fine. We are in a different realm of awareness,\" don Juan againseemed to say to me.I could not speak. I felt the lethargy [* lethargy- state of deep and usuallyprolonged unconsciousness with motor and mental inactivity; unable to respond toexternal stimuli] of deep sleep preventing me from saying a word, yet I was asalert as I could be.\"What's happening?\" I thought.\"The cave made your assemblage point move,\" don Juan thought, and I heard histhoughts as if they were my own words, voiced to myself.I sensed a command that was not expressed in thoughts. Something ordered me tolook again at the prairie.As I stared at the wondrous sight, filaments of light began to radiate fromeverything on that prairie. At first it was like the explosion of an infinitenumber of short fibers, then the fibers became long threadlike strands ofluminosity bundled together into beams of vibrating light that reached infinity.There was really no way for me to make sense of what I was seeing, or todescribe it, except as filaments of vibrating light. The filaments were notintermingled or entwined. Although they sprang, and continued to spring, inevery direction, each one was separate, and yet all of them were inextricablybundled together.\"You are seeing the Eagle's emanations and the force that keeps them apart andbundles them together,\" don Juan thought.The instant I caught his thought the filaments of light seemed to consume all myenergy. Fatigue overwhelmed me. It erased my vision and plunged me intodarkness. When I became aware of myself again, there was something so familiar around me,although I could not tell what it was, that I believed myself to be back in anormal state of awareness. Don Juan was asleep beside me, his shoulder againstmine.Then I realized that the darkness around us was so intense that I could not evensee my hands. I speculated that fog must have covered the ledge and filled thecave; or perhaps it was the wispy low clouds that descended every rainy nightfrom the higher mountains like a silent avalanche.Yet in spite of the total blackness, somehow I saw that don Juan had opened hiseyes immediately after I became aware, although he did not look at me. InstantlyI realized that seeing him was not a consequence of light on my retina. It was,rather, a bodily sense.I became so engrossed in observing don Juan without my eyes that I was notpaying attention to what he was telling me. Finally he stopped talking andturned his face to me as if to look me in the eye.He coughed a couple of times to clear his throat and started to talk in a verylow voice. He said that his benefactor used to come to the cave quite often,both with him and with his other disciples, but more often by himself. In thatcave his benefactor saw the same prairie we had just seen; a vision that gavehim the idea of describing the spirit as the flow of things.Don Juan repeated that his benefactor was not a good thinker. Had he been, hewould have realized in an instant that what he had seen and described as theflow of things was intent; the force that permeates everything. Don Juan addedthat if his benefactor ever became aware of the nature of his seeing, he didn'treveal it. Don Juan had the idea that his benefactor never knew it. Instead, hisbenefactor believed that he had seen the flow of things, which was the absolutetruth, but not the way he meant it.Don Juan was so emphatic about this that I wanted to ask him what the differencewas, but I could not speak. My throat seemed frozen. We sat there in completesilence and immobility for hours, yet I did not experience any discomfort: mymuscles did not get tired, my legs did not fall asleep, my back did not ache.When don Juan began to talk again, I did not even notice the transition, and Ireadily abandoned myself to listening to his voice. It was a melodic, rhythmicalsound that emerged from the total blackness that surrounded me.He said that at that very moment I was not in my normal state of awareness norwas I in heightened awareness. I was suspended in a lull, in the blackness ofnonperception. My assemblage point had moved away from perceiving the dailyworld, but it had not moved enough to reach and light a totally new bundle ofenergy fields. Properly speaking, I was caught between two perceptualpossibilities. This in-between state, this lull of perception had been reachedthrough the influence of the cave which was itself guided by the intent of thesorcerers who carved it.Don Juan asked me to pay close attention to what he was going to say next. Hesaid that thousands of years ago, by means of seeing, sorcerers became awarethat the earth was sentient and that its awareness could affect the awareness ofhumans. They tried to find a way to use the earth's influence on human awarenessand they discovered that certain caves were most effective.Don Juan said that the search for caves became nearly full-time work for thosesorcerers; and that through their endeavors they were able to discover a varietyof uses for a variety of cave configurations. He added that out of all that workthe only result pertinent to us was this particular cave and its capacity tomove the assemblage point until it reached a lull of perception.As don Juan spoke, I had the unsettling sensation that something was clearing inmy mind. Something was funneling my awareness into a long narrow channel. Allthe superfluous [* superfluous- serving no useful purpose] half-thoughts andfeelings of my normal awareness were being squeezed out.Don Juan was thoroughly aware of what was happening to me. I heard his softchuckle of satisfaction. He said that now we could talk more easily and ourconversation would have more depth.I remembered at that moment scores of things he had explained to me before. Forinstance, I knew that I was dreaming. I was actually sound asleep yet I wastotally aware of myself through my second attention- the counterpart of mynormal attentiveness.I was certain I was asleep because of a bodily sensation plus a rationaldeduction based on statements that don Juan had made in the past. I had justseen the Eagle's emanations, and don Juan had said that it was impossible forsorcerers to have a sustained view of the Eagle's emanations in any way exceptin dreaming, therefore I had to be dreaming.Don Juan had explained that the universe is made up of energy fields which defydescription or scrutiny. He had said that they resembled filaments of ordinarylight, except that light is lifeless compared to the Eagle's emanations, whichexude awareness.I had never, until this night, been able to see them in a sustained manner, andindeed they were made out of a light that was alive. Don Juan had maintained inthe past that my knowledge and control of intent were not adequate to withstandthe impact of that sight. He had explained that normal perception occurs whenintent, which is pure energy, lights up a portion of the luminous filamentsinside our cocoon, and at the same time brightens a long extension of the sameluminous filaments extending into infinity outside our cocoon.Extraordinary perception, 'seeing', occurs when by the force of intent adifferent cluster of energy fields energizes and lights up. He had said thatwhen a crucial number of energy fields are lit up inside the luminous cocoon, asorcerer is able to see the energy fields themselves.On another occasion don Juan had recounted the rational thinking of the earlysorcerers. He told me that, through their seeing, they realized that awarenesstook place when the energy fields inside our luminous cocoon were aligned withthe same energy fields outside. They believed they had discovered alignment asthe source of awareness.Upon close examination, however, it became evident that what they had calledalignment of the Eagle's emanations did not entirely explain what they wereseeing. They had noticed that only a very small portion of the total number ofluminous filaments inside the cocoon was energized while the rest remainedunaltered. Seeing these few filaments energized had created a false discovery.The filaments did not need to be aligned to be lit up because the ones insideour cocoon were the same as those outside. Whatever energized them wasdefinitely an independent force. They felt they could not continue to call itawareness, as they had, because awareness was the glow of the energy fieldsbeing lit up. So the force that lit up the fields was named will.Don Juan had said that when their seeing became still more sophisticated andeffective, they realized that will was the force that kept the Eagle'semanations separated and was not only responsible for our awareness, but alsofor everything in the universe.They saw that this force had total consciousness and that it sprang from thevery fields of energy that made the universe. They decided then that intent wasa more appropriate name for it than will. In the long run, however, the nameproved disadvantageous, because it does not describe its overwhelming importancenor the living connection it has with everything in the universe.Don Juan had asserted that our great collective flaw is that we live our livescompletely disregarding that connection. The busyness of our lives, ourrelentless interests, concerns, hopes, frustrations, and fears take precedence;and on a day-to-day basis we are unaware of being linked to everything else.Don Juan had stated his belief that the Christian idea of being cast out fromthe Garden of Eden sounded to him like an allegory for losing our silentknowledge; our knowledge of intent. Sorcery, then, was a going back to thebeginning; a return to paradise.We stayed seated in the cave in total silence; perhaps for hours, or perhaps itwas only a few instants. Suddenly don Juan began to talk, and the unexpectedsound of his voice jarred me. I did not catch what he said. I cleared my throatto ask him to repeat what he had said, and that act brought me completely out ofmy reflectiveness.I quickly realized that the darkness around me was no longer impenetrable. Icould speak now. I felt I was back in my normal state of awareness.In a calm voice don Juan told me that for the very first time in my life I hadseen the spirit; the force that sustains the universe. He emphasized that intentis not something one might use or command or move in any way- nevertheless, onecould use it, command it, or move it as one desires.This contradiction, he said, is the essence of sorcery. To fail to understand ithad brought generations of sorcerers unimaginable pain and sorrow. Modern-daynaguals, in an effort to avoid paying this exorbitant price in pain, haddeveloped a code of behavior called the warrior's way, or the impeccable action;which prepared sorcerers by enhancing their sobriety and thoughtfulness.Don Juan explained that at one time in the remote past, sorcerers were deeplyinterested in the general connecting link that intent has with everything. Andby focusing their second attention on that link, they acquired not only directknowledge but also the ability to manipulate that knowledge and performastounding deeds. They did not acquire, however, the soundness of mind needed tomanage all that power.So in a judicious mood, sorcerers decided to focus their second attention solelyon the connecting link of creatures who have awareness. This included the entirerange of existing organic beings; as well as the entire range of what sorcererscall inorganic beings, or allies, which they described as entities withawareness, but no life as we understand life. This solution was not successfuleither, because it, too, failed to bring them wisdom.In their next reduction, sorcerers focused their attention exclusively on thelink that connects human beings with intent. The end result was very much asbefore.Then, sorcerers sought a final reduction. Each sorcerer would be concernedsolely with his individual connection. But this proved to be equallyineffective.Don Juan said that although there were remarkable differences among those fourareas of interest, one was as corrupting as another. So in the end, sorcerersconcerned themselves exclusively with the capacity that their individualconnecting link with intent had to set them free to light the fire from within.He asserted that all modern-day sorcerers have to struggle fiercely to gainsoundness of mind. A nagual has to struggle especially hard because he has morestrength; a greater command over the energy fields that determine perception;and more training in and familiarity with the intricacies of silent knowledge-which is nothing but direct contact with intent.Examined in this way, sorcery becomes an attempt to reestablish our knowledge ofintent and regain use of it without succumbing to it. And the abstract cores ofthe sorcery stories are shades of realization; degrees of our being aware ofintent.I understood don Juan's explanation with perfect clarity. But the more Iunderstood and the clearer his statements became, the greater my sense of lossand despondency. At one moment I sincerely considered ending my life rightthere. I felt I was damned.Nearly in tears, I told don Juan that there was no point in his continuing hisexplanation, for I knew that I was about to lose my clarity of mind, and thatwhen I reverted to my normal state of awareness, I would have no memory ofhaving seen or heard anything. My mundane consciousness would impose itslifelong habit of repetition and the reasonable predictability of its logic.That was why I felt damned. I told him that I resented my fate.Don Juan responded that even in heightened awareness I thrived on repetition,and that periodically I would insist on boring him by describing my attacks offeeling worthless. He said that if I had to go under it should be fighting, notapologizing or feeling sorry for myself; and that it did not matter what ourspecific fate was as long as we faced it with ultimate abandon.His words made me feel blissfully happy. I repeated over and over, tearsstreaming down my cheeks, that I agreed with him. There was such profoundhappiness in me that I suspected my nerves were getting out of hand. I calledupon all my forces to stop this and I felt the sobering effect of my mentalbrakes. But as this happened, my clarity of mind began to diffuse. I silentlyfought- trying to be both less sober and less nervous. Don Juan did not make asound and left me alone.By the time I had reestablished my balance, it was almost dawn. Don Juan stood,stretched his arms above his head and tensed his muscles, making his jointscrack. He helped me up and commented that I had spent a most enlightening night:I had experienced what the spirit was, and had been able to summon hiddenstrength to accomplish something, which on the surface amounted to calming mynervousness; but at a deeper level it had actually been a very successful,volitional movement of my assemblage point. He signaled then that it was time tostart on our way back.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Somersault of ThoughtWe walked into his house around seven in the morning; in time for breakfast. Iwas famished but not tired. We had left the cave to climb down to the valley atdawn. Don Juan, instead of following the most direct route, made a long detourthat took us along the river. He explained that we had to collect our witsbefore we got home.I answered it was very kind of him to say 'our wits' when I was the only onewhose wits were disordered. But he replied that he was acting not out ofkindness, but out of warrior's training. A warrior, he said, was on permanentguard against the roughness of human behavior. A warrior was magical andruthless; a maverick with the most refined taste and manners, whose wordly taskwas to sharpen, yet disguise, his cutting edges so that no one would be able tosuspect his ruthlessness.After breakfast I thought it would be wise to get some sleep, but don Juancontended I had no time to waste. He said that all too soon I would lose thelittle clarity I still had, and if I went to sleep I would lose it all.\"It doesn't take a genius to figure out that there is hardly any way to talkabout intent\" he said quickly as he scrutinized me from head to toe. \"But makingthis statement doesn't mean anything. It is the reason why sorcerers relyinstead on the sorcery stories. And their hope is that someday the abstractcores of the stories will make sense to the listener.\"I understood what he was saying, but I still could not conceive what an abstractcore was or what it was supposed to mean to me. I tried to think about it.Thoughts barraged me. Images passed rapidly through my mind giving me no time tothink about them. I could not slow them down enough even to recognize them.Finally anger overpowered me and I slammed my fist on the table.Don Juan shook from head to toe, choking with laughter.\"Do what you did last night,\" he urged me, winking. \"Slow yourself down.\"My frustration made me very aggressive. I immediately put forth some senselessarguments; then I became aware of my error and apologized for my lack ofrestraint.\"Don't apologize,\" he said. \"I should tell you that the understanding you'reafter is impossible at this time. The abstract cores of the sorcery stories willsay nothing to you now. Later- years later, I mean- they may make perfect senseto you.\"I begged don Juan not to leave me in the dark; to discuss the abstract cores. Itwas not at all clear to me what he wanted me to do with them. I assured him thatmy present state of heightened awareness could be very helpful to me in allowingme to understand his discussion.I urged him to hurry, for I could not guarantee how long this state would last.I told him that soon I would return to my normal state and would become a biggeridiot than I was at that moment. I had said it half in jest. His laughter toldme that he had taken it as such, but I was deeply affected by my own words. Atremendous sense of melancholy overtook me.Don Juan gently took my arm, pulled me to a comfortable armchair, then sat downfacing me. He gazed fixedly into my eyes, and for a moment I was incapable ofbreaking the force of his stare.\"Sorcerers constantly stalk themselves,\" he said in a reassuring voice, as iftrying to calm me with the sound of his voice.I wanted to say that my nervousness had passed and that it had probably beencaused by my lack of sleep, but he did not allow me to say anything.He assured me that he had already taught me everything there was to know aboutstalking, but I had not yet retrieved my knowledge from the depth of heightenedawareness where I had it stored.I told him I had the annoying sensation of being bottled up. I felt there wassomething locked inside me; something that made me slam doors and kick tables;something that frustrated me and made me irascible. [* irascible- quicklyaroused to anger]\"That sensation of being bottled up is experienced by every human being,\" hesaid. \"It is a reminder of our existing connection with intent. For sorcerersthis sensation is even more acute, precisely because their goal is to sensitizetheir connecting link until they can make it function at will.\"When the pressure of their connecting link is too great, sorcerers relieve itby stalking themselves.\"\"I still don't think I understand what you mean by stalking\" I said. \"But at acertain level I think I know exactly what you mean.\"\"I'll try to help you clarify what you know, then,\" he said. \"Stalking is aprocedure; a very simple one. Stalking is special behavior that follows certainprinciples. It is secretive, furtive, deceptive behavior designed to deliver ajolt. And when you stalk yourself, you jolt yourself using your own behavior ina ruthless, cunning way.\"He explained that when a sorcerer's awareness became bogged down with the weightof his perceptual input- which was what was happening to me- the best, or evenperhaps the only remedy was to use the idea of death to deliver that stalkingjolt.\"The idea of death, therefore, is of monumental importance in the life of asorcerer,\" don Juan continued. \"I have shown you innumerable things about deathto convince you that the knowledge of our impending and unavoidable end is whatgives us sobriety. Our most costly mistake as average men is indulging in asense of immortality. It is as though we believe that if we don't think aboutdeath, we can protect ourselves from it.\"\"You must agree, don Juan, not thinking about death certainly protects us fromworrying about it.\"\"Yes, it serves that purpose,\" he conceded. \"But that purpose is an unworthy onefor average men and a travesty for sorcerers. Without a clear view of death,there is no order; no sobriety; no beauty. Sorcerers struggle to gain thiscrucial insight in order to help them realize at the deepest possible level thatthey have no assurance whatsoever that their lives will continue beyond themoment. This realization gives sorcerers the courage to be patient and yet takeaction; courage to be acquiescent [* acquiescent- willing to carry out theorders or wishes of another without protest] without being stupid.\"Don Juan fixed his gaze on me. He smiled and shook his head.\"Yes,\" he went on. \"The idea of death is the only thing that can give sorcererscourage. Strange, isn't it? It gives sorcerers the courage to be cunning withoutbeing conceited, and above all it gives them courage to be ruthless withoutbeing self-important.\"He smiled again and nudged me. I told him I was absolutely terrified by the ideaof my death; that I thought about it constantly, but it certainly didn't give mecourage or spur me to take action. It only made me cynical or caused me to lapseinto moods of profound melancholy.\"Your problem is very simple,\" he said. \"You become easily obsessed. I have beentelling you that sorcerers stalk themselves in order to break the power of theirobsessions. There are many ways of stalking oneself. If you don't want to usethe idea of your death, use the poems you read me to stalk yourself.\"\"I beg your pardon?\"\"I have told you that there are many reasons I like poems,\" he said. \"What I dois stalk myself with them. I deliver a jolt to myself with them. I listen, andas you read, I shut off my internal dialogue and let my inner silence gainmomentum. Then the combination of the poem and the silence delivers the jolt.\"He explained that poets unconsciously long for the sorcerers' world; but becausethey are not sorcerers on the path of knowledge, longing is all they have.\"Let us see if you can feel what I'm talking about,\" he said, handing me a bookof poems by Jose Gorostiza.I opened it at the bookmark and he pointed to the poem he liked. ...this incessant stubborn dying;this living deaththat slays you, oh God,in your rigorous handiwork;in the roses;in the stones;in the indomitable stars;and in the flesh that burns outlike a bonfire lit by a song;a dream;a hue that hits the eye. ...and you, yourself,perhaps have diedeternities of ages ago out therewithout us knowing about it;we dregs, crumbs, ashes of you.You that still are presentlike a star faked by its very light;an empty light without starthat reaches ushiding its infinite catastrophe. \"As I hear the words,\" don Juan said when I had finished reading, \"I feel thatthat man is seeing the essence of things and I can see with him. I don't carewhat the poem is about. I care only about the feeling the poet's longing bringsme. I borrow his longing, and with it I borrow the beauty. And I marvel at thefact that he, like a true warrior, lavishes it on the recipients, the beholders,retaining for himself only his longing. This jolt, this shock of beauty, isstalking.\"I was very moved. Don Juan's explanation had touched a strange chord in me.\"Would you say, don Juan, that death is the only real enemy we have?\" I askedhim a moment later.\"No,\" he said with conviction. \"Death is not an enemy, although it appears tobe. Death is not our destroyer, although we think it is.\"\"What is it, then, if not our destroyer?\" I asked.\"Sorcerers say death is the only worthy opponent we have,\" he replied. \"Death isour challenger. We are born to take that challenge, average men or sorcerers.Sorcerers know about it; average men do not.\"\"I personally would say, don Juan, life, not death, is the challenge.\"\"Life is the process by means of which death challenges us,\" he said. \"Death isthe active force. Life is the arena. And in that arena there are only twocontenders at any time: oneself and death.\"\"I would think, don Juan, that we human beings are the challengers,\" I said.\"Not at all,\" he retorted. \"We are passive. Think about it. If we move, it'sonly when we feel the pressure of death. Death sets the pace for our actions andfeelings and pushes us relentlessly until it breaks us and wins the bout, orelse we rise above all possibilities and defeat death.\"Sorcerers defeat death and death acknowledges the defeat by letting thesorcerers go free, never to be challenged again.\"\"Does that mean that sorcerers become immortal?\"\"No. It doesn't mean that,\" he replied. \"Death stops challenging them, that'sall.\"\"But what does that mean, don Juan?\" I asked.\"It means thought has taken a somersault into the inconceivable,\" he said.\"What is a somersault of thought into the inconceivable?\" I asked, trying not tosound belligerent. \"The problem you and I have is that we do not share the samemeanings.\"\"You're not being truthful,\" don Juan interrupted. \"You understand what I mean.For you to demand a rational explanation of a somersault of thought into theinconceivable is a travesty. You know exactly what it is.\"\"No, I don't,\" I said.And then I realized that I did, or rather, that I intuited what it meant. Therewas some part of me that could transcend my rationality and understand andexplain, beyond the level of metaphor, a somersault of thought into theinconceivable. The trouble was that part of me was not strong enough to surfaceat will.I said as much to don Juan, who laughed and commented that my awareness was likea yo-yo. Sometimes it rose to a high spot and my command was keen, while atothers it descended and I became a rational moron. But most of the time ithovered at an unworthy median where I was neither fish nor fowl.\"A somersault of thought into the inconceivable,\" he explained with an air ofresignation, \"is the descent of the spirit; the act of breaking our perceptualbarriers. It is the moment in which man's perception reaches its limits.Sorcerers practice the art of sending scouts- advance runners to probe ourperceptual limits. This is another reason I like poems. I take them as advancerunners. But, as I've said to you before, poets don't know as exactly assorcerers what those advance runners can accomplish.\" In the early evening, don Juan said that we had many things to discuss and askedme if I wanted to go for a walk. I was in a peculiar state of mind. Earlier Ihad noticed a strange aloofness in myself that came and went. At first I thoughtit was physical fatigue clouding my thoughts. But my thoughts were crystalclear. So I became convinced that my strange detachment was a product of myshift to heightened awareness.We left the house and strolled around the town's plaza. I quickly asked don Juanabout my aloofness before he had a chance to begin on anything else. Heexplained it as a shift of energy. He said that as the energy that wasordinarily used to maintain the fixed position of the assemblage point becameliberated, it focused automatically on that connecting link.He assured me that there were no techniques or maneuvers for a sorcerer to learnbeforehand to move energy from one place to the other. Rather it was a matter ofan instantaneous shift taking place once a certain level of proficiency had beenattained.I asked him what the level of proficiency was.\"Pure understanding,\" he replied. \"In order to attain that instantaneous shiftof energy, one needed a clear connection with intent, and to get a clearconnection one needed only to intend it through pure understanding.\"Naturally I wanted him to explain pure understanding. He laughed and sat down ona bench.\"I'm going to tell you something fundamental about sorcerers and their acts ofsorcery,\" he went on. \"Something about the somersault of their thought into theinconceivable.\"He said that some sorcerers were storytellers. Storytelling for them was notonly the advance runner that probed their perceptual limits, but also their pathto perfection; to power; to the spirit.He was quiet for a moment, obviously searching for an appropriate example. Thenhe reminded me that the Yaqui Indians had a collection of historical events theycalled 'the memorable dates'.I knew that the memorable dates were oral accounts of their history as a nationwhen they waged war against the invaders of their homeland: the Spaniards first;the Mexicans later. Don Juan, a Yaqui himself, stated emphatically that thememorable dates were accounts of their defeats and disintegration.He asked me, \"So, what would you say- since you are a learned man- about asorcerer storyteller's taking an account from the memorable dates- let's say,for example, the story of Calixto Muni- and changing the ending so that insteadof describing how Calixto Muni was drawn and quartered by the Spanishexecutioners, which is what happened; he tells a story of Calixto Muni thevictorious rebel who succeeded in liberating his people?\"I knew the story of Calixto Muni. He was a Yaqui Indian who, according to thememorable dates, served for many years on a buccaneer ship in the Caribbean inorder to learn war strategy. Then he returned to his native Sonora, managed tostart an uprising against the Spaniards, and declared a war of independence;only to be betrayed, captured, and executed.Don Juan coaxed me to comment. I told him I would have to assume that changingthe factual account in the manner he was describing would be a psychologicaldevice; a sort of wishful thinking on the sorcerer storyteller's part. Orperhaps it would be a personal, idiosyncratic [* idiosyncratic- peculiar to theindividual] way of alleviating frustration. I added that I would even call sucha sorcerer storyteller a patriot because he was unable to accept bitter defeat.Don Juan laughed until he was choking.\"But it's not a matter of one sorcerer storyteller,\" he argued. \"They all dothat.\"\"Then it's a socially sanctioned device to express the wishful thinking of awhole society,\" I retorted. \"A socially accepted way of releasing psychologicalstress collectively.\"\"Your argument is glib and convincing and reasonable,\" he commented. \"Butbecause your spirit is dead, you can't see the flaw in your argument.\"He eyed me as if coaxing me to understand what he was saying. I had no comment,and anything I might have said would have made me sound peevish.\"The sorcerer storyteller who changes the ending of the 'factual' account,\" hesaid, \"does it at the direction and under the auspices [* auspices- kindlyendorsement and guidance] of the spirit. Because he can manipulate his elusiveconnection with intent, he can actually change things. The sorcerer storytellersignals that he has intended it by taking off his hat, putting it on the ground,and turning it a full three hundred and sixty degrees counterclockwise. Underthe auspices of the spirit, that simple act plunges him into the spirit itself.He has let his thought somersault into the inconceivable.\"Don Juan lifted his arm above his head and pointed for an instant to the skyabove the horizon.\"Because his pure understanding is an advance runner probing that immensity outthere,\" don Juan went on, \"the sorcerer storyteller knows without a shadow ofdoubt that somewhere, somehow, in that infinity, at this very moment the spirithas descended. Calixto Muni is victorious. He has delivered his people. His goalhas transcended his person.\" =============================================================="},{"pageContent":"Moving the Assemblage PointA couple of days later, don Juan and I made a trip to the mountains. Halfway upthe foothills we sat down to rest. Earlier that day, don Juan had decided tofind an appropriate setting in which to explain some intricate aspects of themastery of awareness. Usually he preferred to go to the closer western range ofmountains.This time, however, he chose the eastern peaks. They were much higher andfarther away. To me they seemed more ominous, darker, and more massive. But Icould not tell whether this impression was my own or if I had somehow absorbeddon Juan's feelings about these mountains.I opened my backpack. The women seers from don Juan's group had prepared it forme, and I discovered that they had packed some cheese. I experienced a moment ofannoyance because, while I liked cheese, it did not agree with me. Yet I wasincapable of refusing it whenever it was made available.Don Juan had pointed this out as a true weakness and had made fun of me. I wasembarrassed at first, but found that when I did not have cheese around I did notmiss it.The problem was that the practical jokers in don Juan's group always packed abig chunk of cheese for me, which, of course, I always ended up eating.\"Finish it in one sitting,\" don Juan advised me with a mischievous glint in hiseyes. \"That way you won't have to worry about it anymore.\"Perhaps influenced by his suggestion, I had the most intense desire to devourthe whole chunk. Don Juan laughed so much that I suspected once again that hehad schemed with his group to set me up.In a more serious mood, he suggested that we spend the night there in thefoothills, and take a day or two to reach the higher peaks. I agreed.Don Juan casually asked me if I had recalled anything about the four moods ofstalking. I admitted that I had tried, but that my memory had failed me.\"Don't you remember my teaching you the nature of ruthlessness?\" he asked.\"Ruthlessness, the opposite of self-pity?\"I could not remember. Don Juan appeared to be considering what to say next. Thenhe stopped. The corners of his mouth dropped in a gesture of sham impotence. Heshrugged his shoulders, stood up and quickly walked a short distance to a smalllevel spot on top of a hill.\"All sorcerers are ruthless,\" he said, as we sat down on the flat ground. \"Butyou know this. We have discussed this concept at length.\"After a long silence, he said that we were going to continue discussing theabstract cores of the sorcery stories, but that he intended to talk less andless about them because the time was approaching when it would be up to me todiscover them and allow them to reveal their meaning.\"As I have already told you,\" he said, \"the fourth abstract core of the sorcerystories is called the descent of the spirit, or being moved by intent. The storysays that in order to let the mysteries of sorcery reveal themselves to the manwe've been talking about, it was necessary for the spirit to descend on thatman.\"The spirit chose a moment when the man was distracted and unguarded; andshowing no pity, the spirit let its presence by itself move the man's assemblagepoint to a specific position. This spot was known to sorcerers from then on asthe place of no pity. Ruthlessness became, in this way, the first principle ofsorcery.\"The first principle should not be confused with the first effect of sorceryapprenticeship, which is the shift between normal and heightened awareness.\"\"I don't understand what you are trying to tell me,\" I complained.\"What I want to say is that, to all appearances, having the assemblage pointshift is the first thing that actually happens to a sorcery apprentice,\" hereplied. \"So, it is only natural for an apprentice to assume that this is thefirst principle of sorcery. But it is not.\"Ruthlessness is the first principle of sorcery. But we have discussed thisbefore. Now I am only trying to help you remember.\"I could honestly have said that I had no idea what he was talking about, but Ialso had the strange sensation that I did.\"Bring back the recollection of the first time I taught you ruthlessness,\" heurged. \"Recollecting has to do with moving the assemblage point.\"He waited a moment to see whether I was following his suggestion. Since it wasobvious that I could not, he continued his explanation. He said that, mysteriousas the shift into heightened awareness was, all that one needed to accomplish itwas the presence of the spirit.I remarked that his statements that day were either extremely obscure, or I wasterribly dense; because I could not follow his line of thought at all. Hereplied firmly that my confusion was unimportant and insisted that the onlything of real importance was that I understand that the mere contact with thespirit could bring about any movement of the assemblage point.\"I've told you the nagual is the conduit of the spirit,\" he went on. \"Since hespends a lifetime impeccably redefining his connecting link with intent, andsince he has more energy than the average man, he can let the spirit expressitself through him.\"So, the first thing the sorcerer apprentice experiences is a shift in his levelof awareness; a shift brought about simply by the presence of the nagual. Andwhat I want you to know is, that there really is no procedure involved in makingthe assemblage point move. The spirit touches the apprentice and his assemblagepoint moves. It is as simple as that.\"I told him that his assertions were disturbing because they contradicted what Ihad painfully learned to accept through personal experience: that heightenedawareness was feasible as a sophisticated, although inexplicable, maneuverperformed by don Juan by means of which he manipulated my perception. Throughoutthe years of our association, he had time after time made me enter intoheightened awareness by striking me on my back. I pointed out thiscontradiction.He replied that striking my back was more a trick to trap my attention andremove doubts from my mind than a bona fide maneuver to manipulate myperception. He called it a simple trick, in keeping with his moderatepersonality.He commented, not quite as a joke, that I was lucky he was a plain man, notgiven to weird behavior. Otherwise, instead of simple tricks, I would have hadto endure bizarre rituals before he could remove all doubts from my mind; to letthe spirit move my assemblage point.\"What we need to do to allow magic to get hold of us is to banish doubt from ourminds,\" he said. \"Once doubts are banished, anything is possible.\"He reminded me of an event I had witnessed some months before in Mexico City;which I had found to be incomprehensible until he had explained it using thesorcerers' paradigm. What I had witnessed was a surgical operation performed by a famous psychichealer. A friend of mine was the patient. The healer was a woman who entered avery dramatic trance to operate on him.I was able to observe that, using a kitchen knife, she cut his abdominal cavityopen in the umbilical region, detached his diseased liver, washed it in a bucketof alcohol, put it back in and closed the bloodless opening with just thepressure of her hands.There had been a number of people in the semidark room; witnesses to theoperation. Some of them seemed to be interested observers like myself. Theothers seemed to be the healer's helpers.After the operation, I talked briefly to three of the observers. They all agreedthat they had witnessed the same events I had. When I talked to my friend, thepatient, he reported that he had felt the operation as a dull, constant pain inhis stomach and a burning sensation on his right side.I had narrated all of this to don Juan and I had even ventured a cynicalexplanation. I had told him that the semidarkness of the room, in my opinion,lent itself perfectly to all kinds of sleight of hand which could have accountedfor the sight of the internal organs being pulled out of the abdominal cavityand washed in alcohol. The emotional shock caused by the healer's dramatictrance- which I also considered trickery- helped to create an atmosphere ofalmost religious faith.Don Juan immediately pointed out that this was a cynical opinion, and not acynical explanation, because it did not explain the fact that my friend hadreally gotten well. Don Juan had then proposed an alternative view based onsorcerers' knowledge. He had explained that the event hinged on the salient factthat the healer was capable of moving the assemblage point of the exact numberof people in her audience. The only trickery involved- if one could call ittrickery- was that the number of people present in the room could not exceed thenumber she could handle.Her dramatic trance and the accompanying histrionics were, according to him,either well thought out devices the healer used to trap the attention of thosepresent, or unconscious maneuvers dictated by the spirit itself. Whichever; theywere the most appropriate means whereby the healer could foster the unity ofthought needed to remove doubt from the minds of those present and force theminto heightened awareness.When she cut the body open with a kitchen knife and removed the internal organs,it was not, don Juan had stressed, sleight of hand. These were bona fide events;which by virtue of taking place in heightened awareness, were outside the realmof everyday judgment.I had asked don Juan how the healer could manage to move the assemblage pointsof those people without touching them. His reply had been that the healer'spower- a gift, or a stupendous accomplishment- served as a conduit for thespirit. It was the spirit, he had said, and not the healer, which had movedthose assemblage points. \"I explained to you then, although you didn't understand a word of it,\" don Juanwent on, \"that the healer's art and power was to remove doubts from the minds ofthose present. By doing this, she was able to allow the spirit to move theirassemblage points. Once those points had moved, everything was possible. Theyhad entered into the realm where miracles are commonplace.\"He asserted emphatically that the healer must also have been a sorceress, andthat if I made an effort to remember the operation, I would remember that shehad been ruthless with the people around her; especially the patient.I repeated to him what I could recall of the session. The pitch and tone of thehealer's flat, feminine voice changed dramatically when she entered a trance. Itchanged into a raspy, deep, male voice. That voice announced that the spirit ofa warrior of pre-Columbian antiquity had possessed the healer's body. Once theannouncement was made, the healer's attitude changed dramatically. She waspossessed. She was obviously absolutely sure of herself, and she proceeded tooperate with total certainty and firmness.\"I prefer the word 'ruthlessness' to 'certainty and firmness',\" don Juancommented, then continued. \"That healer had to be ruthless to create the propersetting for the spirit's intervention.\"He asserted that events difficult to explain, such as that operation, werereally very simple. They were made difficult by our insistence upon thinking. Ifwe did not think, everything fit into place.\"That is truly absurd, don Juan,\" I said and really meant it.I reminded him that he demanded serious thinking of all his apprentices, andeven criticized his own teacher for not being a good thinker.\"Of course I insist that everyone around me think clearly,\" he said. \"And Iexplain, to anyone who wants to listen, that the only way to think clearly is tonot think at all. I was convinced you understood this sorcerers' contradiction.\"In a loud voice I protested the obscurity of his statements. He laughed and madefun of my compulsion to defend myself. Then he explained again that for asorcerer there were two types of thinking.One was average day-today thinking, which was ruled by the normal position ofhis assemblage point. It was muddled thinking that did not really answer hisneeds and left great murkiness in his head.The other was precise thinking. It was functional, economical, and left very fewthings unexplained. Don Juan remarked that for this type of thinking to prevailthe assemblage point had to move. Or at least the day-to-day type thinking hadto stop to allow the assemblage point to shift. Thus the apparent contradiction,which was really no contradiction at all.\"I want you to recall something you have done in the past,\" he said. \"I want youto recall a special movement of your assemblage point. And to do this, you haveto stop thinking the way you normally think. Then the other, the type I callclear thinking, will take over and make you recollect.\"\"But how do I stop thinking?\" I asked, although I knew what he was going toreply.\"By intending the movement of your assemblage point,\" he said. \"Intent isbeckoned with the eyes.\"I told don Juan that my mind was shifting back and forth between moments oftremendous lucidity, when everything was crystal clear, and lapses into profoundmental fatigue during which I could not understand what he was saying.He tried to put me at ease, explaining that my instability was caused by aslight fluctuation of my assemblage point, which had not stabilized in the newposition it had reached some years earlier. The fluctuation was the result ofleft-over feelings of self-pity.\"What new position is that, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Years ago- and this is what I want you to recollect- your assemblage pointreached the place of no pity,\" he replied.\"I beg your pardon?\" I said.\"The place of no pity is the site of ruthlessness,\" he said. \"But you know allthis. For the time being, though, until you recollect, let's say thatruthlessness, being a specific position of the assemblage point, is shown in theeyes of sorcerers. It's like a shimmering film over the eyes. The eyes ofsorcerers are brilliant. The greater the shine, the more ruthless the sorcereris. At this moment, your eyes are dull.\"He explained that when the assemblage point moved to the place of no pity, theeyes began to shine. The firmer the grip of the assemblage point on its newposition, the more the eyes shone.\"Try to recall what you already know about this,\" he urged me. He kept quiet fora moment, then spoke without looking at me.\"Recollecting is not the same as remembering,\" he continued. \"Remembering isdictated by the day-to-day type of thinking, while recollecting is dictated bythe movement of the assemblage point.\"A recapitulation of their lives, which sorcerers do, is the key to moving theirassemblage points. Sorcerers start their recapitulation by thinking; byremembering the most important acts of their lives. From merely thinking aboutthem they then move on to actually being at the site of the event. When they cando that- be at the site of the event- they have successfully shifted theirassemblage point to the precise spot it was when the event took place. Bringingback the total event by means of shifting the assemblage point is known assorcerers' recollection.\"He stared at me for an instant as if trying to make sure I was listening.\"Our assemblage points are constantly shifting,\" he explained, \"imperceptibleshifts. Sorcerers believe that in order to make their assemblage points shift toprecise spots we must engage intent. Since there is no way of knowing whatintent is, sorcerers let their eyes beckon it.\"\"All this is truly incomprehensible to me,\" I said.Don Juan put his hands behind his head and lay down on the ground. I did thesame. We remained quiet for a long time. The wind scudded the clouds. Theirmovement almost made me feel dizzy. And the dizziness changed abruptly into afamiliar sense of anguish.Every time I was with don Juan, I felt, especially in moments of rest and quiet,an overwhelming sensation of despair- a longing for something I could notdescribe. When I was alone, or with other people, I was never a victim of thisfeeling. Don Juan had explained that what I felt and interpreted as longing wasin fact the sudden movement of my assemblage point.When don Juan started to speak, all of a sudden the sound of his voice jolted meand I sat up.\"You must recollect the first time your eyes shone,\" he said, \"because that wasthe first time your assemblage point reached the place of no pity. Ruthlessnesspossessed you then. Ruthlessness makes sorcerers' eyes shine, and that shinebeckons intent. Each spot to which their assemblage points move is indicated bya specific shine of their eyes. Since their eyes have their own memory, they cancall up the recollection of any spot by calling up the specific shine associatedwith that spot.\"He explained that the reason sorcerers put so much emphasis on the shine oftheir eyes and on their gaze is because the eyes are directly connected tointent. Contradictory as it might sound, the truth is that the eyes are onlysuperficially connected to the world of everyday life. Their deeper connectionis to the abstract.I could not conceive how my eyes could store that sort of information, and Isaid as much. Don Juan's reply was that man's possibilities are so vast andmysterious that sorcerers, rather than thinking about them, choose to explorethem with no hope of ever understanding them.I asked him if an average man's eyes were also affected by intent.\"Of course!\" he exclaimed. \"You know all this. But you know it at such a deeplevel that it is silent knowledge. You haven't sufficient energy to explain it;not even to yourself.\"The average man knows the same thing about his eyes, but he has even lessenergy than you. The only advantages sorcerers may have over average men is thatthey have stored their energy- which means a more precise, clearer connectinglink with intent. Naturally, it also means they can recollect at will using theshine of their eyes to move their assemblage points.\"Don Juan stopped talking and fixed me with his gaze. I clearly felt his eyesguiding, pushing and pulling something indefinite in me. I could not break awayfrom his stare. His concentration was so intense it actually caused a physicalsensation in me: I felt as if I were inside a furnace. And, quite abruptly, Iwas looking inward. It was a sensation very much like being in an absentmindedreverie, but with the strange accompanying sensation of an intense awareness ofmyself, and an absence of thoughts. Supremely aware, I was looking inward, intonothingness.With a gigantic effort, I pulled myself out of it and stood up.\"What did you do to me, don Juan?\"\"Sometimes you are absolutely unbearable,\" he said. \"Your wastefulness isinfuriating. Your assemblage point was just in the most advantageous spot torecollect anything you wanted, and what did you do? You let it all go, to ask mewhat I did to you.\"He kept silent for a moment, and then smiled as I sat down again.\"But being annoying is really your greatest asset,\" he added. \"So why should Icomplain?\"Both of us broke into a loud laugh. It was a private joke. Years before, I had been both very moved and very confused by don Juan'stremendous dedication to helping me. I could not imagine why he should show mesuch kindness. It was evident that he did not need me in any way in his life. Hewas obviously not investing in me. But I had learned, through life's painfulexperiences, that nothing was free; and being unable to foresee what don Juan'sreward would be made me tremendously uneasy.One day I asked don Juan point-blank, in a very cynical tone, what he wasgetting out of our association. I said that I had not been able to guess.\"Nothing you would understand,\" he replied.His answer annoyed me. Belligerently I told him I was not stupid, and he couldat least try to explain it to me.\"Well, let me just say that, although you could understand it, you are certainlynot going to like it,\" he said with the smile he always had when he was settingme up. \"You see, I really want to spare you.\"I was hooked, and I insisted that he tell me what he meant.\"Are you sure you want to hear the truth?\" he asked, knowing I could never sayno, even if my life depended on it.\"Of course I want to hear whatever it is you're dangling in front of me,\" I saidcuttingly.He started to laugh as if at a big joke; the more he laughed, the greater myannoyance.\"I don't see what's so funny,\" I said.\"Sometimes the underlying truth shouldn't be tampered with,\" he said. \"Theunderlying truth here is like a block at the bottom of a big pile of things, acornerstone. If we take a hard look at the bottom block, we might not like theresults. I prefer to avoid that.\"He laughed again. His eyes, shining with mischievousness, seemed to invite me topursue the subject further. And I insisted again that I had to know what he wastalking about. I tried to sound calm but persistent.\"Well, if that is what you want,\" he said with the air of one who had beenoverwhelmed by the request. \"First of all, I'd like to say that everything I dofor you is free. You don't have to pay for it.\"As you know, I've been impeccable with you. And as you also know, myimpeccability with you is not an investment. I am not grooming you to take careof me when I am too feeble to look after myself. But I do get something ofincalculable value out of our association, a sort of reward for dealingimpeccably with that bottom block I've mentioned. And what I get is the verything you are perhaps not going to understand or like.\"He stopped and peered at me, with a devilish glint in his eyes.\"Tell me about it, don Juan!\" I exclaimed, irritated with his delaying tactics.\"I want you to bear in mind that I am telling you at your insistence,\" he said,still smiling.He paused again. By then I was fuming.\"If you were to judge me by my actions with you,\" he said, \"you would have toadmit that I have been a paragon of patience and consistency. But what you don'tknow is that to accomplish this I have had to fight for impeccability as I havenever fought before. In order to spend time with you, I have had to transformmyself daily; restraining myself with the most excruciating effort.\"Don Juan had been right. I did not like what he said. I tried not to lose faceand made a sarcastic comeback.\"I'm not that bad, don Juan,\" I said.My voice sounded surprisingly unnatural to me.\"Oh, yes, you are that bad,\" he said with a serious expression. \"You are petty,wasteful, opinionated, coercive, short-tempered, conceited. You are morose,ponderous, and ungrateful. You have an inexhaustible capacity forself-indulgence. And worst of all, you have an exalted idea of yourself withnothing whatever to back it up.\"I could sincerely say that your mere presence makes me feel like vomiting.\"I wanted to get angry. I wanted to protest; to complain that he had no right totalk to me that way, but I could not utter a single word. I was crushed. I feltnumb.My expression, upon hearing the bottom truth, must have been something becausedon Juan broke into such gales of laughter that I thought he was going to choke.\"I told you you were not going to like it or understand it,\" he said. \"Warriors'reasons are very simple, but their finesse is extreme. It is a rare opportunityfor a warrior to be given a genuine chance to be impeccable in spite of hisbasic feelings.\"You gave me such a unique chance. The act of giving freely and impeccablyrejuvenates me and renews my wonder. What I get from our association is indeedof incalculable value to me. I am in your debt.\" His eyes were shining, but without mischievousness, as he peered at me.Don Juan began to explain what he had done.\"I am the nagual, I moved your assemblage point with the shine of my eyes,\" hesaid matter-of-factly. \"The nagual's eyes can do that. It's not difficult. Afterall, the eyes of all living beings can move someone else's assemblage point,especially if their eyes are focused on intent. Under normal conditions,however, people's eyes are focused on the world, looking for food... looking forshelter...\"He nudged my shoulder.\"Looking for love,\" he added and broke into a loud laugh.Don Juan constantly teased me about my 'looking for love'. He never forgot anaive answer I once gave him when he had asked me what I actively looked for inlife. He had been steering me toward admitting that I did not have a clear goal,and he roared with laughter when I said that I was looking for love.\"A good hunter mesmerizes his prey with his eyes,\" he went on. \"With his gaze hemoves the assemblage point of his prey, and yet his eyes are on the world,looking for food.\"I asked him if sorcerers could mesmerize people with their gaze. He chuckled andsaid that what I really wanted to know was if I could mesmerize women with mygaze in spite of the fact that my eyes were focused on the world, looking forlove. He added, seriously, that the sorcerers' safety valve was that by the timetheir eyes were really focused on intent, they were no longer interested inmesmerizing anyone.\"But, for sorcerers to use the shine of their eyes to move their own or anyoneelse's assemblage point,\" he continued, \"they have to be ruthless. That is, theyhave to be familiar with that specific position of the assemblage point calledthe place of no pity. This is especially true for the naguals.\"He said that each nagual developed a brand of ruthlessness specific to himalone. He took my case as an example, and said that because of my unstablenatural configuration, I appeared to seers as a sphere of luminosity notcomposed of four balls compressed into one- the usual structure of a nagual- butas a sphere composed of only three compressed balls. This configuration made meautomatically hide my ruthlessness behind a mask of indulgence and laxness.\"Naguals are very misleading,\" don Juan went on. \"They always give theimpression of something they are not, and they do it so completely thateverybody, including those who know them best, believe their masquerade.\"\"I really don't understand how you can say that I am masquerading, don Juan,\" Iprotested.\"You pass yourself off as an indulgent, relaxed man,\" he said. \"You give theimpression of being generous; of having great compassion. And everybody isconvinced of your genuineness. They can even swear that that is the way youare.\"\"But that is the way I am!\"Don Juan doubled up with laughter. The direction the conversation had taken wasnot to my liking. I wanted to set the record straight. I argued vehemently [*vehemently- in a manner marked by extreme intensity of emotions or convictions]that I was truthful in everything I did, and challenged him to give me anexample of my being otherwise.He said I compulsively treated people with unwarranted generosity, giving them afalse sense of my ease and openness. And I argued that being open was my nature.He laughed and retorted that if this were the case, why should be that I alwaysdemanded, without voicing it, that the people I dealt with be aware I wasdeceiving them? The proof was that when they failed to be aware of my ploy andtook my pseudo-laxness at face value, I turned on them with exactly the coldruthlessness I was trying to mask.His comments made me feel desperate, because I couldn't argue with them. Iremained quiet. I did not want to show that I was hurt. I was wondering what todo when he stood and started to walk away.I stopped him by holding his sleeve. It was an unplanned move on my part whichstartled me and made him laugh. He sat down again with a look of surprise on hisface.\"I didn't mean to be rude,\" I said, \"but I've got to know more about this. Itupsets me.\"\"Make your assemblage point move,\" he urged. \"We've discussed ruthlessnessbefore. Recollect it!\"He eyed me with genuine expectation although he must have seen that I could notrecollect anything, for he continued to talk about the naguals' patterns ofruthlessness. He said that his own method consisted of subjecting people to aflurry of coercion and denial, hidden behind sham understanding andreasonableness.\"What about all the explanations you give me?\" I asked. \"Aren't they the resultof genuine reasonableness and desire to help me understand?\"\"No,\" he replied. \"They are the result of my ruthlessness.\"I argued passionately that my own desire to understand was genuine. He patted meon the shoulder and explained that my desire to understand was genuine, but mygenerosity was not. He said that naguals masked their ruthlessnessautomatically, even against their will.As I listened to his explanation, I had the peculiar sensation in the back of mymind that at some point we had covered the concept of ruthlessness extensively.\"I'm not a rational man,\" he continued, looking into my eyes. \"I only appear tobe because my mask is so effective. What you perceive as reasonableness is mylack of pity, because that's what ruthlessness is: a total lack of pity.\"In your case, since you mask your lack of pity with generosity, you appear atease; open. But actually you are as generous as I am reasonable. We are bothfakes. We have perfected the art of disguising the fact that we feel no pity.\"He said his benefactor's total lack of pity was masked behind the facade of aneasygoing, practical joker with an irresistible need to poke fun at anyone withwhom he came into contact.\"My benefactor's mask was that of a happy, unruffled man without a care in theworld,\" don Juan continued. \"But underneath all that he was, like all thenaguals, as cold as the arctic wind.\"\"But you are not cold, don Juan,\" I said sincerely.\"Of course I am,\" he insisted. \"The effectiveness of my mask is what gives youthe impression of warmth.\"He went on to explain that the nagual Elias's mask consisted of a maddeningmeticulousness about all details and accuracy, which created the falseimpression of attention and thoroughness.He started to describe the nagual Elias's behavior. As he talked, he keptwatching me. And perhaps because he was observing me so intently, I was unableto concentrate at all on what he was saying. I made a supreme effort to gathermy thoughts.He watched me for an instant, then went back to explaining ruthlessness, but Ino longer needed his explanation.I told him that I had recollected what he wanted me to recollect: the first timemy eyes had shone. Very early in my apprenticeship I had achieved- by myself- ashift in my level of awareness. My assemblage point reached the position calledthe place of no pity.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Place of No PityDon Juan told me that there was no need to talk about the details of myrecollection, at least not at that moment, because talk was used only to leadone to recollecting. Once the assemblage point moved, the total experience wasrelived. He also told me the best way to assure a complete recollection was towalk around.And so both of us stood up; walked very slowly and in silence, following a trailin those mountains, until I had recollected everything. We had been in the outskirts of Guaymas, in northern Mexico, on a drive fromNogales, Arizona, when it became evident to me that something was wrong with donJuan. For the last hour or so he had been unusually quiet and somber.I did not think anything of it, but then, abruptly, his body twitched out ofcontrol. His chin hit his chest as if his neck muscles could no longer supportthe weight of his head.\"Are you getting carsick, don Juan?\" I asked, suddenly alarmed.He did not answer. He was breathing through his mouth.During the first part of our drive, which had taken several hours, he had beenfine. We had talked a great deal about everything. When we had stopped in thecity of Santa Ana to get gas, he had even been doing push-outs against the roofof the car to loosen up the muscles of his shoulders.\"What's wrong with you, don Juan?\" I asked.I felt pangs of anxiety in my stomach. With his head down, he mumbled that hewanted to go to a particular restaurant and in a slow, faltering voice gave meprecise directions on how to get there.I parked my car on a side street, a block from the restaurant. As I opened thecar door on my side, he held onto my arm with an iron grip. Painfully, and withmy help, he dragged himself out of the car, over the driver's seat. Once he wason the sidewalk, he held onto my shoulders with both hands to straighten hisback. In ominous silence, we shuffled down the street toward the dilapidatedbuilding where the restaurant was.Don Juan was hanging onto my arm with all his weight. His breathing was soaccelerated and the tremor in his body so alarming that I panicked. I stumbledand had to brace myself against the wall to keep us both from falling to thesidewalk. My anxiety was so intense I could not think. I looked into his eyes.They were dull. They did not have the usual shine.We clumsily entered the restaurant and a solicitous waiter rushed over, as if oncue, to help don Juan.\"How are you feeling today?\" he yelled into don Juan's ear.He practically carried don Juan from the door to a table, seated him, and thendisappeared.\"Does he know you, don Juan?\" I asked when we were seated.Without looking at me, he mumbled something unintelligible. I stood up and wentto the kitchen to look for the busy waiter.\"Do you know the old man I am with?\" I asked when I was able to corner him.\"Of course I know him,\" he said with the attitude of someone who has just enoughpatience to answer one question. \"He's the old man who suffers from strokes.\"That statement settled things for me. I knew then that don Juan had suffered amild stroke while we were driving. There was nothing I could have done to avoidit, but I felt helpless and apprehensive. The feeling that the worst had not yethappened made me feel sick to my stomach.I went back to the table and sat down in silence. Suddenly the same waiterarrived with two plates of fresh shrimp and two large bowls of sea-turtle soup.The thought occurred to me that either the restaurant served only shrimp andsea-turtle soup, or don Juan ate the same thing every time he was here.The waiter talked so loudly to don Juan he could be heard above the clatter ofcustomers.\"Hope you like your food!\" he yelled. \"If you need me, just lift your arm. I'llcome right away.\"Don Juan nodded his head affirmatively, and the waiter left after patting donJuan affectionately on the back.Don Juan ate voraciously, smiling to himself from time to time. I was soapprehensive that just the thought of food made me feel nauseous. But then Ireached a familiar threshold of anxiety, and the more I worried, the hungrier Ibecame. I tried the food, and found it incredibly good.I felt somewhat better after having eaten, but the situation had not changed,nor had my anxiety diminished.When don Juan was through eating, he shot his arm straight above his head. In amoment, the waiter came over and handed me the bill.I paid him and he helped don Juan stand up. He guided him by the arm out of therestaurant. The waiter even helped him out to the street and said goodbye to himeffusively. [* effusively- in a manner filled with unrestrained inthusiasm]We walked back to the car in the same laborious way with don Juan leaningheavily on my arm, and panting and stopping to catch his breath every few steps.The waiter stood in the doorway as if to make sure I was not going to let donJuan fall.Don Juan took two or three full minutes to climb into the car.\"Tell me, what can I do for you, don Juan?\" I pleaded.\"Turn the car around,\" he ordered in a faltering, barely audible voice. \"I wantto go to the other side of town to the store. They know me there, too. They aremy friends.\"I told him I had no idea what store he was talking about. He mumbledincoherently and had a tantrum. He stamped on the floor of the car with bothfeet. He pouted and actually drooled on his shirt.Then he seemed to have an instant of lucidity. I got extremely nervous watchinghim struggle to arrange his thoughts. He finally succeeded in telling me how toget to the store.My discomfort was at its peak. I was afraid that the stroke don Juan hadsuffered was more serious than I thought. I wanted to be rid of him; to take himto his family or his friends, but I did not know who they were.I did not know what else to do. I made a U-turn, and drove to the store which hesaid was on the other side of town.I wondered about going back to the restaurant to ask the waiter if he knew donJuan's family. I hoped someone in the store might know him. The more I thoughtabout my predicament, the sorrier I felt for myself. Don Juan was finished. Ihad a terrible sense of loss, of doom. I was going to miss him, but my sense ofloss was offset by my feeling of annoyance at being saddled with him at hisworst.I drove around for almost an hour looking for the store. I could not find it.Don Juan admitted that he might have made a mistake, that the store might be ina different town. By then I was completely exhausted and had no idea what to donext.In my normal state of awareness I always had the strange feeling that I knewmore about him than my reason told me. Now, under the pressure of his mentaldeterioration, I was certain, without knowing why, that his friends were waitingfor him somewhere in Mexico, although I did not know where.My exhaustion was more than physical. It was a combination of worry and guilt.It worried me that I was stuck with a feeble old man who might, for all I knew,be mortally ill. And I felt guilty for being so disloyal to him.I parked my car near the waterfront. It took nearly ten minutes for don Juan toget out of the car. We walked toward the ocean, but as we got closer, don Juanshied like a mule and refused to go on. He mumbled that the water of Guaymas Bayscared him.He turned around and led me to the main square: a dusty plaza without evenbenches. Don Juan sat down on the curb. A street-cleaning truck went by,rotating its steel brushes, but no water was squirting into them. The cloud ofdust made me cough.I was so disturbed by my situation that the thought of leaving him sitting therecrossed my mind. I felt embarrassed at having had such a thought and patted donJuan's back.\"You must make an effort and tell me where I can take you,\" I said softly.\"Where do you want me to go.\"\"I want you to go to hell!\" he replied in a cracked, raspy voice.Hearing him speak to me like this, I had the suspicion that don Juan might nothave suffered from a stroke, but some other crippling brain condition that hadmade him lose his mind and become violent.Suddenly he stood up and walked away from me. I noticed how frail he looked. Hehad aged in a matter of hours. His natural vigor was gone, and what I saw beforeme was a terribly old, weak man.I rushed to lend him a hand. A wave of immense pity enveloped me. I saw myselfold and weak; barely able to walk. It was intolerable. I was close to weeping,not for don Juan but for myself. I held his arm and made him a silent promisethat I would look after him, no matter what.I was lost in a reverie of self-pity when I felt the numbing force of a slapacross my face. Before I recovered from the surprise, don Juan slapped me againacross the back of my neck. He was standing facing me, shivering with rage. Hismouth was half open and shook uncontrollably.\"Who are you?\" he yelled in a strained voice.He turned to a group of onlookers who had immediately gathered.\"I don't know who this man is,\" he said to them. \"Help me. I'm a lonely oldIndian. He's a foreigner and he wants to kill me. They do that to helpless oldpeople; kill them for pleasure.\"There was a murmur of disapproval. Various young, husky men looked at memenacingly.\"What are you doing, don Juan?\" I asked him in a loud voice. I wanted toreassure the crowd that I was with him.\"I don't know you,\" don Juan shouted. \"Leave me alone.\"He turned to the crowd, and asked them to help him. He wanted them to restrainme until the police came.\"Hold him,\" he insisted. \"And someone, please call the police. They'll know whatto do with this man.\"I had the image of a Mexican jail. No one would know where I was. The idea thatmonths would go by before anyone noticed my disappearance made me react withvicious speed. I kicked the first young man who came close me, then took off ata panicked run. I knew I was running for my life. Several young men ran afterme. As I raced toward the main street, I realized that in a small city likeGuaymas there were policemen all over the place patrolling on foot. There werenone in sight, and before I ran into one I entered the first store in my path. Ipretended to be looking for curios. [* curio- something unusual -- perhapsworthy of collecting]The young men running after me went by noisily. I conceived a quick plan: to buyas many things as I could. I was counting on being taken for a tourist by thepeople in the store. Then I was going to ask someone to help me carry thepackages to my car. It took me quite a while to select what I wanted. I paid ayoung man in the store to help me carry my packages, but as I got closer to mycar, I saw don Juan standing by it, still surrounded by people. He was talkingto a policeman, who was taking notes.It was useless. My plan had failed. There was no way to get to my car. Iinstructed the young man to leave my packages on the sidewalk. I told him afriend of mine was going to drive by presently to take me to my hotel. He leftand I remained hidden behind the packages I was holding in front of my face, outof sight of don Juan and the people around him.I saw the policeman examining my California license plates. And that completelyconvinced me I was done for. The accusation of the crazy old man was too grave.And the fact that I had run away would have only reinforced my guilt in the eyesof any policeman. Besides, I would not have put it past the policeman to ignorethe truth just to arrest a foreigner.I stood in a doorway for perhaps an hour. The policeman left, but the crowdremained around don Juan, who was shouting and agitatedly moving his arms. I wastoo far away to hear what he was saying, but I could imagine the gist of hisfast, nervous shouting.I was in desperate need of another plan. I considered checking into a hotel andwaiting there for a couple of days before venturing out to get my car. I thoughtof going back to the store and having them call a taxi. I had never had to hirea cab in Guaymas and I had no idea if there were any. But my plan died instantlywith the realization that if the police were fairly competent, and had taken donJuan seriously, they would check the hotels. Perhaps the policeman had left donJuan in order to do just that.Another alternative that crossed my mind was to get to the bus station and catcha bus to any town along the international border. Or to take any bus leavingGuaymas any direction. I abandoned the idea immediately. I was sure don Juan hadgiven my name to the policeman and the police had probably already alerted thebus companies. My mind plunged into blind panic. I took short breaths to calm mynerves.I noticed then that the crowd around don Juan was beginning to disperse. Thepoliceman returned with a colleague. Then the two of them moved away, walkingslowly toward the end of the street.It was at that point that I felt sudden uncontrollable urge. It was as if mybody were disconnected from my brain. I walked to my car, carrying the packages.Without even the slightest trace of fear or concern, I opened the trunk, put thepackages inside, then opened the driver's door.Don Juan was on the sidewalk, by my car, looking at me absentmindedly. I staredat him with a thoroughly uncharacteristic coldness. Never in my life had I hadsuch a feeling. It was not hatred I felt, or even anger. I was not even annoyedwith him. What I felt was not resignation or patience, either. And it wascertainly not kindness.Rather it was a cold indifference; a frightening lack of pity. At that instant,I could not have cared less about what happened to don Juan or myself.Don Juan shook his upper body the way a dog shakes itself dry after a swim. Andthen, as if all of it had only been a bad dream, he was again the man I knew. Hequickly turned his jacket inside out. It was a reversible jacket, beige on oneside and black on the other. Now he vas wearing a black jacket. He threw hisstraw hat inside the car and carefully combed his hair. He pulled his shirtcollar over the jacket collar, instantly making himself look younger. Withoutsaying a word, he helped me put the rest of the packages in the car.When the two policemen ran back to us, blowing their whistles, drawn by thenoise of the car doors being opened and closed, don Juan very nimbly rushed tomeet them. He listened to them attentively and assured them they had nothing toworry about. He explained that they must have encountered his father, a feebleold Indian who suffered from brain damage. As he talked to them, he opened andclosed the car doors, as if checking the locks. He moved the packages from thetrunk to the back seat.His agility and youthful strength were the opposite of the old man's movementsof a few minutes ago. I knew that he was acting for the benefit of the policemanwho had seen him before. If I had been that man, there would have been no doubtin my mind that I was now seeing the son of the old braindamaged Indian.Don Juan gave them the name of the restaurant where they knew his father, andthen bribed them shamelessly.I did not bother to say anything to the policemen. There was something that mademe feel hard, cold, efficient, and silent.We got in the car without a word. The policemen did not attempt to ask meanything. They seemed too tired even to try. We drove away.\"What kind of act did you pull out there, don Juan?\" I asked, and the coldnessin my tone surprised me.\"It was the first lesson in ruthlessness,\" he said.He remarked that on our way to Guaymas he had warned me about the impendinglesson on ruthlessness.I confessed that I had not paid attention because I had thought that we werejust making conversation to break the monotony of driving.\"I never just make conversation,\" he said sternly. \"You should know that by now.What I did this afternoon was to create the proper situation for you to moveyour assemblage point to the precise spot where pity disappears. That spot isknown as the place of no pity.\"The problem that sorcerers have to solve,\" he went on, \"is that the place of nopity has to be reached with only minimal help. The nagual sets the scene, but itis the apprentice who makes his assemblage point move.\"Today you just did that. I helped you, perhaps a bit dramatically, by moving myown assemblage point to specific position that made me into a feeble andunpredictable old man. I was not just acting old and feeble. I was old\"The mischievous glint in his eyes told me that he was enjoying the moment.\"It was not absolutely necessary that I do that,\" he went on. \"I could havedirected you to move your assemblage point without the hard tactics, but Icouldn't help myself, this event will never be repeated, I wanted to knowwhether or not I could act, in some measure, like my own benefactor. Believe me,I surprised myself as much as I must have surprised you.\"I felt incredibly at ease. I had no problems in accepting what he was saying tome, and no questions, because I understood everything without needing him toexplain. He then said something which I already knew, but could not verbalize,because I would not have been able to find the appropriate words to describe it.He said that everything sorcerers did was done as a consequence of a movement oftheir assemblage points, and that such movements were ruled by the amount ofenergy sorcerers had at their command.I mentioned to don Juan that I knew all that and much more. And he commentedthat inside every human being was a gigantic, dark lake of silent knowledgewhich each of us could intuit. He told me I could intuit it perhaps with a bitmore clarity than the average man because of my involvement in the warrior'spath. He then said that sorcerers were the only beings on earth who deliberatelywent beyond the intuitive level by training themselves to do two transcendentalthings: first, to conceive the existence of the assemblage point, and second, tomake that assemblage point move.He emphasized over and over that the most sophisticated knowledge sorcererspossessed was of our potential as perceiving beings; and the knowledge that thecontent of perception depended on the position of the assemblage point.At that point I began to experience a unique difficulty in concentrating on whathe was saying, not because I was distracted or fatigued, but because my mind, onits own, had started to play the game of anticipating his words. It was as if anunknown part of myself were inside me, trying unsuccessfully to find adequatewords to voice a thought. As don Juan spoke, I felt I could anticipate how hewas going to express my own silent thoughts. I was thrilled to realize hischoice of words was always better than mine could have been. But anticipatinghis words also diminished my concentration.I abruptly pulled over to the side of the road. And right there I had, for thefirst time in my life, a clear knowledge of a dualism in me. Two obviouslyseparate parts were within my being.One was extremely old, at ease, indifferent. It was heavy, dark, and connectedto everything else. It was the part of me that did not care because it was equalto anything. It enjoyed things with no expectation.The other part was light, new, fluffy, and agitated. It was nervous, and fast.It cared about itself because it was insecure; and did not enjoy anything,simply because it lacked the capacity to connect itself to anything. It wasalone; on the surface; vulnerable. That was the part with which I normallylooked at the world.I deliberately looked around with that part. Everywhere I looked I saw extensivefarmlands. And that insecure, fluffy, and caring part of me got caught betweenbeing proud of the industriousness of man and being sad at the sight of themagnificent old Sonoran desert turned into an orderly scene of furrows anddomesticated plants.The old, dark, heavy part of me did not care. And the two parts entered into adebate. The fluffy part wanted the heavy part to care, and the heavy part wantedthe other one to stop fretting, and to enjoy.\"Why did you stop?\" don Juan asked.His voice produced a reaction, but it would be inaccurate to say that it was Iwho reacted. The sound of his voice seemed to solidify the fluffy part, andsuddenly I was recognizably myself.I described to don Juan the realization I had just had bout my dualism. He beganto explain it in terms of the position of the assemblage point, and I lost mysolidity. The fluffy part became as fluffy as it had been when I first noticedmy dualism, and once again I knew what don Juan was explaining.He said that when the assemblage point moves and reaches the place of no pity,the position of rationality and common sense becomes weak. The sensation I washaving of an older, dark, silent side was a view of the antecedents of reason.\"I know exactly what you are saying,\" I told him. \"I know a great number ofthings, but I can't speak of what I know. I don't know how to begin.\"\"I have mentioned this to you already,\" he said. \"What you are experiencing andcall dualism is a view from another position of your assemblage point. From thatposition, you can feel the older side of man. And what the older side of manknows is called silent knowledge. It's a knowledge that you cannot yet voice.\"\"Why not?\" I asked.\"Because in order to voice it, it is necessary for you to have and use aninordinate amount of energy,\" he replied. \"You don't at this time have that kindof energy to spare.\"Silent knowledge is something that all of us have,\" he went on. \"Something thathas complete mastery; complete knowledge of everything. But it cannot think,therefore, it cannot speak of what it knows.\"Sorcerers believe that when man became aware that he knew, and wanted to beconscious of what he knew, he lost sight of what he knew. This silent knowledge,which you cannot describe, is of course intent- the spirit, the abstract. Man'serror was to want to know it directly, the way he knew everyday life. The morehe wanted, the more ephemeral [* ephemeral- lasting a very short time] itbecame.\"\"But what does that mean in plain words, don Juan?\" I asked.\"It means that man gave up silent knowledge for the world of reason,\" hereplied. \"The more he clings to the world of reason, the more ephemeral intentbecomes.\"I started the car and we drove in silence. Don Juan did not attempt to give medirections or tell me how to drive- a thing he often did in order to exacerbatemy self-importance. I had no clear idea where I was going, yet something in meknew. I let that part take over.Very late in the evening we arrived at the big house don Juan's group ofsorcerers had in a rural area of the state of Sinaloa in northwestern Mexico.The journey seemed to have taken no time at all. I could not remember theparticulars of our drive. All I knew about it was that we had not talked.The house seemed to be empty. There were no signs of people living there. Iknew, however, that don Juan's friends were in the house. I could feel theirpresence without actually having to see them.Don Juan lit some kerosene lanterns and we sat down at a sturdy table. It seemedthat don Juan was getting ready to eat. I was wondering what to say or do when awoman entered noiselessly and put a large plate of food on the table. I was notprepared for her entrance, and when she stepped out of the darkness into thelight as if she had materialized out of nowhere, I gasped involuntarily.\"Don't be scared, it's me, Carmela,\" she said and disappeared, swallowed againby the darkness.I was left with my mouth open in mid-scream. Don Juan laughed so hard that Iknew everybody in the house must have heard him. I half expected them to come,but no one appeared.I tried to eat, but I was not hungry. I began to think about the woman. I didnot know her. That is, I could almost identify her, but I could not quite workmy memory of her out of the fog that obscured my thoughts. I struggled to clearmy mind. I felt that it required too much energy and I gave up.Almost as soon as I had stopped thinking about her, I began to experience astrange, numbing anxiety. At first I believed that the dark, massive house, andthe silence in and around it were depressing.But then my anguish rose to incredible proportions right after I heard the faintbarking of dogs in the distance. For a moment I thought that my body was goingto explode. Don Juan intervened quickly. He jumped to where I was sitting andpushed my back until it cracked. The pressure on my back brought me immediaterelief.When I had calmed down, I realized I had lost, together with the anxiety thathad nearly consumed me, the clear sense of knowing everything. I could no longeranticipate how don Juan was going to articulate what I myself knew.Don Juan then started a most peculiar explanation. First he said that the originof the anxiety that had overtaken me with the speed of wildfire was the suddenmovement of my assemblage point caused by Carmela's sudden appearance; and by myunavoidable effort to move my assemblage point to the place where I would beable to identify her completely.He advised me to get used to the idea of recurrent attacks of the same type ofanxiety because my assemblage point was going to keep moving.\"Any movement of the assemblage point is like dying,\" he said. \"Everything in usgets disconnected, then reconnected again to a source of much greater power.That amplification of energy is felt as a killing anxiety.\"\"What am I to do when this happens?\" I asked.\"Nothing,\" he said. \"Just wait. The outburst of energy will pass. What'sdangerous is not knowing what is happening to you. Once you know, there is noreal danger.\"Then he talked about ancient man. He said that ancient man knew in the mostdirect fashion what to do and how best to do it. But, because he performed sowell, he started to develop a sense of selfness which gave him the feeling thathe could predict and plan the actions he was used to performing.And thus the idea of an individual self appeared; an individual self which beganto dictate the nature and scope of man's actions. As the feeling of theindividual self became stronger, man lost his natural connection to silentknowledge.Modern man, being heir to that development, therefore, finds himself sohopelessly removed from the source of everything that all he can do is expresshis despair in violent and cynical acts of self-destruction. Don Juan assertedthat the reason for man's cynicism and despair is the bit of silent knowledgeleft in him, which does two things: one, it gives man an inkling of his ancientconnection to the source of everything; and two, it makes man feel that withoutthis connection, he has no hope of peace, of satisfaction, of attainment.I thought I had caught don Juan in a contradiction. I pointed out to him that hehad once told me that war was the natural state for a warrior, that peace was ananomaly. [* anomaly- a difference from the normal]\"That's right,\" he admitted. \"But war for a warrior doesn't mean acts ofindividual or collective stupidity or wanton violence. War, for a warrior, isthe total struggle against that individual self that has deprived man of hispower.\" Don Juan said then that it was time for us to talk further about ruthlessness-the most basic premise of sorcery. He explained that sorcerers had discoveredthat any movement of the assemblage point meant a movement away from theexcessive concern with that individual self which was the mark of modern man.He went on to say that sorcerers believed it was the position of the assemblagepoint which made modern man a homicidal egotist, a being totally involved withhis self-image. Having lost hope of ever returning to the source of everything,man sought solace in his selfness. And, in doing so, he succeeded in fixing hisassemblage point in the exact position to perpetuate his self-image. It wastherefore safe to say that any movement of the assemblage point away from itscustomary position resulted in a movement away from man's self-reflection andits concomitant: [* concomitant- an event or situation that happens at the sametime as or in connection with another] self-importance.Don Juan described self-importance as the force generated by man's self-image.He reiterated that it is that force which keeps the assemblage point fixed whereit is at present. For this reason, the thrust of the warriors' way is todethrone self-importance, and everything sorcerers do is toward accomplishingthis goal.He explained that sorcerers had unmasked self-importance and found that it isself-pity masquerading as something else.\"It doesn't sound possible, but that is what it is,\" he said. \"Self-pity is thereal enemy, and the source of man's misery.\"Without a degree of pity for himself, man could not afford to be asself-important as he is.\"However, once the force of self-importance is engaged, it develops its ownmomentum. And it is this seemingly independent nature of self-importance whichgives it its fake sense of worth.\"His explanation, which I would have found incomprehensible under normalconditions, seemed thoroughly cogent [* cogent- powerfully persuasive] to me.But because of the duality in me which still pertained, it appeared a bitsimplistic. Don Juan seemed to have aimed his thoughts and words at a specifictarget. And I, in my normal state of awareness, was that target.He continued his explanation, saying that sorcerers are absolutely convincedthat by moving our assemblage points away from their customary position, weachieve a state of being which could only be called ruthlessness.Sorcerers knew, by means of their practical actions, that as soon as theirassemblage points move, their self-importance crumbles. Without the customaryposition of their assemblage points, their self-image can no longer besustained. And without the heavy focus on that self-image, they lose theirself-compassion, and with it their self-importance. Sorcerers are right,therefore, in saying that self-importance is merely self-pity in disguise. He then took my experience of the afternoon and went through it step by step. Hestated that a nagual in his role as leader or teacher has to behave in the mostefficient, but the same time most impeccable, way.Since it is not possible for him to plan the course of his actions rationally,the nagual always lets the spirit decide his course. For example, he said he hadhad no plans to do what he did until the spirit gave him an indication, veryearly that morning when we were having breakfast in Nogales. He urged me recallthe event and tell him what I could remember. I recalled that during breakfast Igot very embarrassed because don Juan made fun of me.\"Think about the waitress,\" don Juan urged me.\"All I can remember about her is that she was rude.\"\"But what did she do?\" he insisted. \"What did she do while she waited to takeour order?\" After a moment's pause, I remembered that she was a hard-looking young woman whothrew the menu at me and stood there, almost touching me, silently demandingthat I hurry up and order.While she waited, impatiently tapping her big foot on the floor, she pinned herlong black hair up on her head. The change was remarkable. She looked moreappealing, more mature.I was frankly taken by the change in her. In fact, I overlooked her bad mannersbecause of it. \"That was the omen,\" don Juan said. \"Hardness and transformation were theindication of the spirit.\"He said that his first act of the day, as a nagual, was to let me know hisintentions. To that end, he told me in very plain language, but in asurreptitious manner, that he was going to give me a lesson in ruthlessness.\"Do you remember now?\" he asked. \"I talked to the waitress and to an old lady atthe next table.\" Guided by him in this fashion, I did remember don Juan practically flirting withan old lady and the ill-mannered waitress. He talked to them for a long timewhile I ate. He told them idiotically funny stories about graft and corruptionin government, and jokes about farmers in the city.Then he asked the waitress if she was an American. She said no and laughed atthe question. Don Juan said that that was good, because I was a Mexican-Americanin search of love. And I might as well start here, after eating such a goodbreakfast.The women laughed. I thought they laughed at my being embarrassed. Don Juan saidto them that, seriously speaking, I had come to Mexico to find a wife. He askedif they knew of any honest, modest, chaste woman who wanted to get married andwas not too demanding in matters of male beauty. He referred to himself as myspokesman.The women were laughing very hard. I was truly chagrined. Don Juan turned to thewaitress, and asked her if she would marry me. She said that she was engaged. Itlooked to me as though she was taking don Juan seriously.\"Why don't you let him speak for himself?\" the old lady asked don Juan.\"Because he has a speech impediment,\" he said. \"He stutters horribly.\"The waitress said that I had been perfectly normal when I ordered my food.\"Oh! You're so observant,\" don Juan said. \"Only when he orders food can he speaklike anyone else. I've told him time and time again that if he wants to learn tospeak normally, he has to be ruthless. I brought him here to give him somelessons in ruthlessness.\"\"Poor man,\" the old woman said.\"Well, we'd better get going if we are going to find love for him today,\" donJuan said as he stood to leave.\"You're serious about this marriage business,\" the young waitress said to donJuan.\"You bet,\" he replied. \"I'm going to help him get what he needs so he can crossthe border and go to the place of no pity.\"I thought don Juan was calling either marriage or the U.S.A. the place of nopity. I laughed at the metaphor, and stuttered horribly for a moment; whichscared the women to death, and made don Juan laugh hysterically. \"It was imperative that I state my purpose to you then,\" Juan said, continuinghis explanation. \"I did, but it bypassed you completely, as it should have.\"He said that from the moment the spirit manifested itself, every step wascarried to its satisfactory completion with absolute ease. My assemblage pointreached the place of no pity when, under the stress of his transformation, itwas forced to abandon its customary place of self-reflection.\"The position of self-reflection,\" don Juan went on, \"forces the assemblagepoint to assemble a world of sham compassion, but of very real cruelty andself-centeredness. In that world the only real feelings are those convenient forone who feels them.\"For a sorcerer, ruthlessness is not cruelty. Ruthlessness is the opposite ofself-pity or self-importance. Ruthlessness is sobriety.\" ================================================================= Part 5. The Requirements of Intent"},{"pageContent":"Breaking the Mirror of Self-ReflectionWe spent a night at the spot where I had recollected my experience in Guaymas.During that night, because my assemblage point was pliable, don Juan helped meto reach new positions, which immediately became blurry non-memories.The next day I was incapable of remembering what had happened or what I hadperceived. I had, nonetheless, the acute sensation of having had bizarreexperiences. Don Juan agreed that my assemblage point had moved beyond hisexpectations, yet he refused to give me even a hint of what I had done. His onlycomment was that some day I would recollect everything.Around noon, we continued on up the mountains. We walked in silence and withoutstopping until late in the afternoon. As we slowly climbed a mildly steepmountain ridge, don Juan suddenly spoke. I did not understand any of what he wassaying. He repeated it until I realized he wanted to stop on a wide ledgevisible from where we were. He was telling me that we would be protected therefrom the wind by the boulders and large, bushy shrubs.\"Tell me, which spot on the ledge would be the best for us to sit out allnight?\" he asked.Earlier, as we were climbing, I had spotted the almost unnoticeable ledge. Itappeared as a patch of darkness on the face of the mountain. I had identified itwith a very quick glance. Now that don Juan was asking my opinion, I elected aspot of even greater darkness, one almost black, on the south side of the ledge.The dark ledge and the almost black spot in it did not generate any feeling offear or anxiety. I felt that I liked that ledge. And I liked its dark spot evenmore.\"That spot there is very dark, but I like it,\" I said, when we reached theledge.He agreed that that was the best place to sit all night. He said it was a placewith a special level of energy, and that he also liked its pleasing darkness.We headed toward some protruding rocks. Don Juan cleared an area by the bouldersand we sat with our backs against them.I told him that on the one hand I thought it had been a lucky guess on my partto choose that very spot, but on the other I could not overlook the fact that Ihad perceived it with my eyes.\"I wouldn't say that you perceived it exclusively with your eyes,\" he said. \"Itwas a bit more complex than that.\"\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\" I asked.\"I mean that you have possibilities you are not yet aware of,\" he replied.\"Since you're quite careless, you may think that all of what you perceive issimply average sensory perception.\"He said that if I doubted him, he dared me to go down to the base of themountain again and corroborate what he was saying. He predicted that it would beimpossible for me to see the dark ledge merely by looking at it.I stated vehemently that I had no reason to doubt him. I was not going to climbdown that mountain.He insisted that we climb down. I thought he was doing it just to tease me. Igot nervous, though, when it occurred to me that he might be serious. He laughedso hard he choked.He commented on the fact that all animals could detect in their surroundingsareas with special levels of energy. Most animals were frightened of these spotsand avoided them. The exceptions were mountain lions and coyotes which lay andeven slept on such spots whenever they happened upon them. But, only sorcerersdeliberately sought such spots for their effects.I asked him what the effects were. He said that they gave out imperceptiblejolts of invigorating energy. He remarked that the average man living in naturalsettings could find such spots even though he was not conscious about havingfound them nor aware of their effects.\"How do they know they have found them?\" I asked.\"They never do,\" he replied. \"Sorcerers watching men travel on foot trailsnotice right away that men always become tired and rest right on the spot with apositive level of energy. If, on the other hand, they are going through an areawith an injurious flow of energy, they become nervous and rush. If you ask themabout it, they will tell you they rushed through that area because they feltenergized. But it is the opposite- the only place that energizes them is theplace where they feel tired.\"He said that sorcerers are capable of finding such spots by perceiving withtheir entire bodies minute surges of energy in their surroundings. Thesorcerers' increased energy, derived from the curtailment of theirself-reflection, allows their senses a greater range of perception.\"I've been trying to make clear to you that the only worthwhile course ofaction, whether for sorcerers or average men, is to restrict our involvementwith our self-image,\" he continued. \"What a nagual aims at with his apprenticesis the shattering of their mirror of self-reflection.\"He added that each apprentice was an individual case, and that the nagual had tolet the spirit decide about the particulars.\"Each of us has a different degree of attachment to our self-reflection,\" hewent on. \"And that attachment is felt as need. For example, before I started onthe path of knowledge, my life was endless need. And years after the nagualJulian had taken me under his wing, I was still just as needy, if not more so.\"But there are examples of people, sorcerers or average men, who need no one.They get peace, harmony, laughter, knowledge, directly from the spirit. Theyneed no intermediaries. For you and for me, it's different. I'm yourintermediary and the nagual Julian was mine. Intermediaries, besides providing aminimal chance- the awareness of intent- help shatter people's mirrors ofself-reflection.\"The only concrete help you ever get from me is that I attack yourself-reflection. If it weren't for that, you would be wasting your time. This isthe only real help you've gotten from me.\"\"You've taught me, don Juan, more than anyone in my entire life,\" I protested.\"I've taught you all kinds of things in order to trap your attention,\" he said.\"You'll swear, though, that that teaching has been the important part. Ithasn't. There is very little value in instruction. Sorcerers maintain thatmoving the assemblage point is all that matters. And that movement, as you wellknow, depends on increased energy and not on instruction.\" He then made an incongruous [* incongruous- lacking in harmony or compatibilityor appropriateness] statement. He said that any human being who would follow aspecific and simple sequence of actions can learn to move his assemblage point.I pointed out that he was contradicting himself. To me, a sequence of actionsmeant instructions; it meant procedures.\"In the sorcerers' world there are only contradictions of terms,\" he replied.\"In practice there are no contradictions. The sequence of actions I am talkingabout is one that stems from being aware. To become aware of this sequence youneed a nagual. This is why I've said that the nagual provides a minimal chance,but that minimal chance is not instruction, like the instruction you need tolearn to operate a machine. The minimal chance consists of being made aware ofthe spirit.\"He explained that the specific sequence he had in mind called for being awarethat self-importance is the force which keeps the assemblage point fixed. Whenself-importance is curtailed, the energy it requires is no longer expended. Thatincreased energy then serves as the springboard that launches the assemblagepoint- automatically and without premeditation- into an inconceivable journey.Once the assemblage point has moved, the movement itself entails moving fromself-reflection, and this, in turn, assures a clear connecting link with thespirit. He commented that, after all, it was self-reflection that haddisconnected man from the spirit in the first place.\"As I have already said to you,\" don Juan went on, \"sorcery is a journey ofreturn. We return victorious to the spirit, having descended into hell. And fromhell we bring trophies. Understanding is one of our trophies.\"I told him that his sequence seemed very easy and very simple when he talkedabout it, but that when I had tried to put it into practice I had found it thetotal antithesis [* antithesis- exact opposite] of ease and simplicity.\"Our difficulty with this simple progression,\" he said, \"is that most of us areunwilling to accept that we need so little to get on with. We are geared toexpect instruction, teaching, guides, or masters. And when we are told that weneed no one, we don't believe it. We become nervous, then distrustful, andfinally angry and disappointed. If we need help, it is not in methods, but inemphasis. If someone makes us aware that we need to curtail our self-importance,that help is real.\"Sorcerers say we should need no one to convince us that the world is infinitelymore complex than our wildest fantasies. So, why are we dependent? Why do wecrave someone to guide us when we can do it ourselves? Big question, eh?\"Don Juan did not say anything else. Obviously, he wanted me to ponder thequestion. But I had other worries in my mind. My recollection had underminedcertain foundations that I had believed unshakable, and I desperately needed himto redefine them.I broke the long silence and voiced my concern. I told him that I had come toaccept that it was possible for me to forget whole incidents from beginning toend if they had taken place in heightened awareness. Up to that day, I had hadtotal recall of anything I had done under his guidance in my state of normalawareness. Yet, having had breakfast with him in Nogales had not existed in mymind prior to my recollecting it. And that event simply must have taken place inthe world of everyday affairs.\"You are forgetting something essential,\" he said. \"The nagual's presence isenough to move the assemblage point. I have humored you all along with thenagual's blow. The blow between the shoulder blades that I have delivered isonly a pacifier. It serves the purpose of removing your doubts. Sorcerers usephysical contact as a jolt to the body. It doesn't do anything but giveconfidence to the apprentice who is being manipulated.\"\"Then who moves the assemblage point, don Juan?\" I asked.\"The spirit does it,\" he replied in the tone of someone about to lose hispatience.He seemed to check himself and smiled and shook his head from side to side in agesture of resignation.\"It's hard for me to accept,\" I said. \"My mind is ruled by the principle ofcause and effect.\"He had one of his usual attacks of inexplicable laughter- inexplicable from mypoint of view, of course. I must have looked annoyed. He put his hand on myshoulder.\"I laugh like this periodically because you are demented,\" he said. \"The answerto everything you ask me is staring you right in the eyes and you don't see it.I think dementia is your curse.\"His eyes were so shiny, so utterly crazy and mischievous, that I ended uplaughing myself.\"I have insisted to the point of exhaustion that there are no procedures insorcery,\" he went on. \"There are no methods, no steps. The only thing thatmatters is the movement of the assemblage point. And no procedure can causethat. It's an effect that happens all by itself.\"He pushed me as if to straighten my shoulders, and then he peered at me, lookingright into my eyes. My attention became riveted to his words.\"Let us see how you figure this out,\" he said. \"I have just said that themovement of the assemblage point happens by itself. But I have also said thatthe nagual's presence moves his apprentice's assemblage point; and that the waythe nagual masks his ruthlessness either helps or hinders that movement. Howwould you resolve this contradiction?\"I confessed that I had been just about to ask him about the contradiction, for Ihad been aware of it, but that I could not even begin to think of resolving it.I was not a sorcery practitioner.\"What are you, then?\" he asked.\"I am a student of anthropology, trying to figure out what sorcerers do,\" Isaid.My statement was not altogether true, but it was not a lie.Don Juan laughed uncontrollably.\"It's too late for that,\" he said. \"Your assemblage point has moved already. Andit is precisely that movement that makes one a sorcerer.\"He stated that what seemed a contradiction was really the two sides of the samecoin. The nagual entices the assemblage point into moving by helping to destroythe mirror of self-reflection. But that is all the nagual can do. The actualmover is the spirit, the abstract; something that cannot be seen or felt;something that does not seem to exist, and yet does.For this reason, sorcerers report that the assemblage point moves all by itself.Or they say that the nagual moves it. The nagual, being the conduit of theabstract, is allowed to express the spirit through his actions.I looked at don Juan questioningly.\"The nagual moves the assemblage point, and yet it is not he himself who doesthe actual moving,\" don Juan said. \"Or perhaps it would be more appropriate tosay that the spirit expresses itself in accordance with the nagual'simpeccability. The spirit can move the assemblage point with the mere presenceof an impeccable nagual.\"He said that he had wanted to clarify this point, because, if it wasmisunderstood, it led a nagual back to self-importance and thus to hisdestruction.He changed the subject and said that, because the spirit had no perceivableessence, sorcerers deal rather with the specific instances and ways in whichthey are able to shatter the mirror of self-reflection.Don Juan noted that in this area it was important to realize the practical valueof the different ways in which the naguals masked their ruthlessness. He said mymask of generosity, for example, was adequate for dealing with people on ashallow level, but useless for shattering their self-reflection because itforced me to demand an almost impossible decision on their part. I expected themto jump into the sorcerers' world without any preparation.\"A decision such as that jump must be prepared for,\" he went on. \"And in orderto prepare for it, any kind of mask for a nagual's ruthlessness will do, exceptthe mask of generosity.\"Perhaps because I desperately wanted to believe that I was truly generous, hiscomments on my behavior renewed my terrible sense of guilt. He assured me that Ihad nothing to be ashamed of, and that the only undesirable effect was that mypseudo-generosity did not result in positive trickery.In this regard, he said, although I resembled his benefactor in many ways, mymask of generosity was too crude, too obvious to be of value to me as a teacher.A mask of reasonableness, such as his own, however, was very effective increating an atmosphere propitious [* propitious- likely to result in success] tomoving the assemblage point. His disciples totally believed his pseudoreasonableness. In fact, they were so inspired by it that he could easily trickthem into exerting themselves to any degree.\"What happened to you that day in Guaymas was an example of how the nagual'smasked ruthlessness shatters self-reflection,\" he continued. \"My mask was yourdownfall. You, like everyone around me, believed my reasonableness. And, ofcourse, you expected, above all, the continuity of that reasonableness.\"When I faced you with not only the senile behavior of a feeble old man, butwith the old man himself, your mind went to extremes in its efforts to repair mycontinuity and your self-reflection. And so you told yourself that I must havesuffered a stroke.\"Finally, when it became impossible to believe in the continuity of myreasonableness, your mirror began to break down. From that point on, the shiftof your assemblage point was just a matter of time. The only thing in questionwas whether it was going to reach the place of no pity.\"I must have appeared skeptical to don Juan because he explained that the worldof our self-reflection or of our mind was very flimsy and was held together by afew key ideas that served as its underlying order. When those ideas failed, theunderlying order ceased to function.\"What are those key ideas, don Juan?\" I asked.\"In your case regarding that particular instance, as in the case of the audienceof that healer we talked about, continuity was the key idea,\" he replied.\"What is continuity?\" I asked.\"The idea that we are a solid block,\" he said. \"In our minds, what sustains ourworld is the certainty that we are unchangeable.We may accept that our behavior can be modified, and that our reactions andopinions can be modified. But the idea that we are malleable to the point ofchanging appearances- to the point of being someone else- that is not part ofthe underlying order of our self-reflection. Whenever a sorcerer interrupts thatorder, the world of reason stops.\"I wanted to ask him if breaking an individual's continuity was enough to causethe assemblage point to move. He seemed to anticipate my question. He said thatthat breakage was merely a softener. What helped the assemblage point move wasthe nagual's ruthlessness.He then compared the acts he performed that afternoon in Guaymas with theactions of the healer we had previously discussed. He said that the healer hadshattered the self-reflection of the people in her audience with a series ofacts for which they had no equivalents in their daily lives- the dramatic spiritpossession, changing voices, cutting the patient's body open. As soon as thecontinuity of the idea of themselves was broken, their assemblage points wereready to be moved.He reminded me that he had described to me in the past the concept of stoppingthe world. He had said that stopping the world was as necessary for sorcerers asreading and writing was for me. It consisted of introducing a dissonant elementinto the fabric of everyday behavior for purposes of halting the otherwisesmooth flow of ordinary events- events which were catalogued in our minds by ourreason.The dissonant element was called 'not-doing', or the opposite of doing. 'Doing'was anything that was part of a whole for which we had a cognitive account.Not-doing was an element that did not belong in that charted whole.\"Sorcerers, because they are stalkers, understand human behavior to perfection,\"he said. They understand, for instance, that human beings are creatures ofinventory. Knowing the ins and outs of a particular inventory is what makes aman a scholar or an expert in his field.\"Sorcerers know that when an average person's inventory fails, the person eitherenlarges his inventory or his world of self-reflection collapses. The averageperson is willing to incorporate new items into his inventory if they don'tcontradict the inventory's underlying order. But if the items contradict thatorder, the person's mind collapses. The inventory is the mind. Sorcerers counton this when they attempt to break the mirror of self-reflection.\"He explained that that day he had carefully chosen the props for his act tobreak my continuity. He slowly transformed himself until he was indeed a feebleold man, and then, in order to reinforce the breaking of my continuity, he tookme to a restaurant where they knew him as an old man.I interrupted him. I had become aware of a contradiction I had not noticedbefore. He had said, at the time, that the reason he transformed himself wasthat he wanted to know what it was like to be old. The occasion was propitiousand unrepeatable. I had understood that statement as meaning that he had notbeen an old man before. Yet at the restaurant they knew him as the feeble oldman who suffered from strokes.\"The nagual's ruthlessness has many aspects,\" he said. \"It's like a tool thatadapts itself to many uses. Ruthlessness is a state of being. It is a level ofintent that the nagual attains.\"The nagual uses it to entice the movement of his own assemblage point or thoseof his apprentices. Or he uses it to stalk. I began that day as a stalker,pretending to be old, and ended up as a genuinely old, feeble man. Myruthlessness, controlled by my eyes, made my own assemblage point move.\"Although I had been at the restaurant many times before as an old, sick man, Ihad only been stalking, merely playing at being old. Never before that day hadmy assemblage point moved to the precise spot of age and senility.\"He said that as soon as he had intended to be old, his eyes lost their shine,and I immediately noticed it. Alarm was written all over my face. The loss ofthe shine in his eyes was a consequence of using his eyes to intend the positionof an old man. As his assemblage point reached that position, he was able to agein appearance, behavior, and feeling.I asked him to clarify the idea of intending with the eyes. I had the faintnotion I understood it, yet I could not formulate even to myself what I knew.\"The only way of talking about it is to say that intent is intended with theeyes,\" he said. \"I know that it is so. Yet, just like you, I can't pinpoint whatit is I know. Sorcerers resolve this particular difficulty by acceptingsomething extremely obvious: Human beings are infinitely more complex andmysterious than our wildest fantasies.\"I insisted that he had not shed any light on the matter.\"All I can say is that the eyes do it,\" he said cuttingly. \"I don't know how,but they do it. They summon intent with something indefinable that they have;something in their shine. Sorcerers say that intent is experienced with theeyes, not with the reason.\"He refused to add anything and went back to explaining my recollection. He saidthat once his assemblage point had reached the specific position that made himgenuinely old, doubts should have been completely removed from my mind. But dueto the fact that I took pride in being super-rational, I immediately did my bestto explain away his transformation.\"I've told you over and over that being too rational is a handicap,\" he said.\"Human beings have a very deep sense of magic. We are part of the mysterious.Rationality is only a veneer with us. If we scratch that surface, we find asorcerer underneath. Some of us, however, have great difficulty gettingunderneath the surface level; others do it with total ease. You and I are veryalike in this respect- we both have to sweat blood before we let go of ourself-reflection.\"I explained to him that, for me, holding onto my rationality had always been amatter of life or death. Even more so when it came to my experiences in hisworld.He remarked that that day in Guaymas my rationality had been exceptionallytrying for him. From the start he had had to make use of every device he knew toundermine it. To that end, he began by forcibly putting his hands on myshoulders and nearly dragging me down with his weight. That blunt physicalmaneuver was the first jolt to my body. And this, together with my fear causedby his lack of continuity, punctured my rationality.\"But puncturing your rationality was not enough,\" don Juan went on. \"I knew thatif your assemblage point was going to reach the place of no pity, I had to breakevery vestige of my continuity. That was when I became really senile and madeyou run around town, and I finally got angry at you and slapped you.\"You were shocked, but you were on the road to instant recovery when I gave yourmirror of self-image what should have been its final blow. I yelled 'bloodymurder'. I didn't expect you to run away. I had forgotten about your violentoutbursts.\"He said that in spite of my on-the-spot recovery tactics, my assemblage pointreached the place of no pity when I became enraged at his senile behavior. Orperhaps it had been the opposite: I became enraged because my assemblage pointhad reached the place of no pity. It did not really matter. What counted wasthat my assemblage point did arrive there.Once it was there, my own behavior changed markedly. I became cold andcalculating and indifferent to my personal safety.I asked don Juan whether he had seen all this. I did not remember telling himabout it. He replied that to know what I was feeling, all he had to do wasintrospect and remember his own experience.He pointed out that my assemblage point became fixed in its new position when hereverted to his natural self. By then, my conviction about his normal continuityhad suffered such a profound upheaval that continuity no longer functioned as acohesive force. And it was at that moment, from its new position, that myassemblage point allowed me to build another type of continuity, one which Iexpressed in terms of a strange, detached hardness- a hardness that became mynormal mode of behavior from then on.\"Continuity is so important in our lives that if it breaks it's always instantlyrepaired,\" he went on. \"In the case of sorcerers, however, once their assemblagepoints reach the place of no pity, continuity is never the same.\"Since you are naturally slow, you haven't noticed yet that since that day inGuaymas you have become, among other things, capable of accepting any kind ofdiscontinuity at its face value- after a token struggle of your reason, ofcourse.\"His eyes were shining with laughter.\"It was also that day that you acquired your masked ruthlessness,\" he went on.\"Your mask wasn't as well developed as it is now, of course, but what you gotthen was the rudiments of what was to become your mask of generosity.\"I tried to protest. I did not like the idea of masked ruthlessness, no matterhow he put it.\"Don't use your mask on me,\" he said, laughing. \"Save it for a better subject:someone who doesn't know you.\"He urged me to recollect accurately the moment the mask came to me.\"As soon as you felt that cold fury coming over you,\" he went on, \"you had tomask it. You didn't joke about it, as my benefactor would have done. You didn'ttry to sound reasonable about it, like I would. You didn't pretend to beintrigued by it, like the nagual Elias would have. Those are the three nagual'smasks I know. What did you do then? You calmly walked to your car and gave halfof your packages away to the guy who was helping you carry them.\"Until that moment I had not remembered that indeed someone helped me carry thepackages. I told don Juan that I had seen lights dancing before my face, and Ihad thought I was seeing them because, driven by my cold fury, I was on theverge of fainting.\"You were not on the verge of fainting,\" don Juan answered. \"You were on theverge of entering a dreaming state and seeing the spirit all by yourself; likeTalia and my benefactor.\"I said to don Juan that it was not generosity that made me give away thepackages but cold fury. I had to do something to calm myself, and that was thefirst thing that occurred to me.\"But that's exactly what I've been telling you. Your generosity is not genuine,\"he retorted and began to laugh at my dismay.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Ticket to ImpeccabilityIt had gotten dark while don Juan was talking about breaking the mirror ofself-reflection. I told him I was thoroughly exhausted, and we should cancel therest of the trip and return home; but he maintained that we had to use everyminute of our available time to review the sorcery stories, or recollect bymaking my assemblage point move as many times as possible.I was in a complaining mood. I said that a state of deep fatigue such as minecould only breed uncertainty and lack of conviction.\"Your uncertainty is to be expected,\" don Juan said matter-of-factly. \"Afterall, you are dealing with a new type of continuity. It takes time to get used toit. Warriors spend years in limbo where they are neither average men norsorcerers.\"\"What happens to them in the end?\" I asked. \"Do they choose sides?\"\"No. They have no choice,\" he replied. \"All of them become aware of what theyalready are: sorcerers. The difficulty is that the mirror of self-reflection isextremely powerful and only lets its victims go after a ferocious struggle.\"He stopped talking and seemed lost in thought. His body entered into the stateof rigidity that I had seen before whenever he was engaged in what Icharacterized as reveries, but which he described as instances in which hisassemblage point had moved and he was able to recollect.\"I'm going to tell you the story of a sorcerer's ticket to impeccability,\" hesuddenly said after some thirty minutes of total silence. \"I'm going to tell youthe story of my death.\" He began to recount what had happened to him after his arrival in Durango stilldisguised in women's clothes following his month long journey through centralMexico. He said that old Belisario took him directly to a hacienda to hide fromthe monstrous man who was chasing him.As soon as he arrived, don Juan- very daringly in view of his taciturn [*taciturn- habitually reserved and uncommunicative] nature- introduced himself toeveryone in the house. There were seven beautiful women and a strange unsociableman who did not utter a single word.Don Juan delighted the lovely women with his rendition of the monstrous man'sefforts to capture him. Above all, they were enchanted with the disguise whichhe still wore, and the story that went with it. They never tired of hearing thedetails of his trip, and all of them advised him on how to perfect the knowledgehe had acquired during his journey. What surprised don Juan was their poise andassuredness, which were unbelievable to him.The seven women were exquisite and they made him feel happy. He liked them andtrusted them. They treated him with respect and consideration. But something intheir eyes told him that under their facades of charm, there existed aterrifying coldness; an aloofness he could never penetrate.The thought occurred to him that in order for these strong and beautiful womento be so at ease and to have no regard for formalities, they had to be loosewomen. Yet it was obvious to him that they were not.Don Juan was left alone to roam the property. He was dazzled by the huge mansionand its grounds. He had never seen anything like it. It was an old colonialhouse with a high surrounding wall. Inside were balconies with flowerpots andpatios with enormous fruit trees that provided shade, privacy, and quiet.There were large rooms, and on the ground floor airy corridors around thepatios. On the upper floor there were mysterious bedrooms where don Juan was notpermitted to set foot.During the following days don Juan was amazed by the profound interest the womentook in his well-being. They did everything for him. They seemed to hang on hisevery word. Never before had people been so kind to him. But also, never beforehad he felt so solitary. He was always in the company of the beautiful, strangewomen, and yet he had never been so alone.Don Juan believed that his feeling of aloneness came from being unable topredict the behavior of the women or to know their real feelings. He knew onlywhat they told him about themselves.A few days after his arrival, the woman who seemed to be their leader gave himsome brand-new men's clothes and told him that his woman's disguise was nolonger necessary, because whoever the monstrous man might have been, he was nownowhere in sight. She told him he was free to go whenever he pleased.Don Juan begged to see Belisario, whom he had not seen since the day theyarrived. The woman said that Belisario was gone. He had left word, however, thatdon Juan could stay in the house as long as he wanted- but only if he was indanger.Don Juan declared he was in mortal danger. During his few days in the house, hehad seen the monster constantly, always sneaking about the cultivated fieldssurrounding the house. The woman did not believe him and told him bluntly thathe was a con artist pretending to see the monster so they would take him in. Shetold him their house was not a place to loaf. She stated they were seriouspeople who worked very hard and could not afford to keep a freeloader.Don Juan was insulted. He stomped out of the house, but when he caught sight ofthe monster hiding behind the ornamental shrubbery bordering the walk, hisfright immediately replaced his anger.He rushed back into the house and begged the woman to let him stay. He promisedto do peon labor for no wages if he could only remain at the hacienda. Sheagreed, but with the understanding that don Juan would accept two conditions:that he not ask any questions, and that he do exactly as he was told withoutrequiring any explanations. She warned him that if he broke these rules his stayat the house would be in jeopardy.\"I stayed in the house really under protest,\" don Juan continued. \"I did notlike to accept her conditions, but I knew that the monster was outside. In thehouse I was safe. I knew that the monstrous man was always stopped at aninvisible boundary that encircled the house, at a distance of perhaps a hundredyards. Within that circle I was safe. As far as I could discern, there must havebeen something about that house that kept the monstrous man away, and that wasall I cared about.\"I also realized that when the people of the house were around me the monsternever appeared.\"After a few weeks with no change in his situation, the young man who don Juanbelieved had been living in the monster's house disguised as old Belisarioreappeared. He told don Juan that he had just arrived, that his name was Julian,and that he owned the hacienda.Don Juan naturally asked him about his disguise. But the young man, looking himin the eye and without the slightest hesitation, denied knowledge of anydisguise.\"How can you stand here in my own house and talk such rubbish?\" he shouted atdon Juan. \"What do you take me for?\"\"But- you are Belisario, aren't you?\" don Juan insisted.\"No,\" the young man said. \"Belisario is an old man. I am Julian and I'm young.Don't you see?\"Don Juan meekly admitted that he had not been quite convinced that it was adisguise and immediately realized the absurdity of his statement. If being oldwas not a disguise, then it was a transformation, and that was even more absurd.Don Juan's confusion increased by the moment. He asked about the monster and theyoung man replied that he had no idea what monster he was talking about. Heconceded that don Juan must have been scared by something, otherwise oldBelisario would not have given him sanctuary. But whatever reason don Juan hadfor hiding, it was his personal business.Don Juan was mortified by the coldness of his host's tone and manner. Riskinghis anger, don Juan reminded him that they had met. His host replied that he hadnever seen him before that day, but that he was honoring Belisario's wishes ashe felt obliged to do.The young man added that not only was he the owner of the house but that he wasalso in charge of every person in that household, including don Juan, who, bythe act of hiding among them, had become a ward of the house. If don Juan didnot like the arrangement, he was free to go and take his chances with themonster no one else was able to see.Before he made up his mind one way or another, don Juan judiciously decided toask what being a ward of the house involved.The young man took don Juan to a section of the mansion that was underconstruction and said that that part of the house was symbolic of his own lifeand actions. It was unfinished. Construction was indeed underway, but chanceswere it might never be completed.\"You are one of the elements of that incomplete construction,\" he said to donJuan. \"Let's say that you are the beam that will support the roof. Until we putit in place and put the roof on top of it, we won't know whether it will supportthe weight. The master carpenter says it will. I am the master carpenter.\"This metaphorical explanation meant nothing to don Juan, who wanted to know whatwas expected of him in matters of manual labor.The young man tried another approach.\"I'm a nagual,\" he explained. \"I bring freedom. I'm the leader of the people inthis house. You are in this house, and because of that you are part of itwhether you like or not.\"Don Juan looked at him dumbfounded, unable to say anything.\"I am the nagual Julian,\" his host said, smiling. \"Without my intervention,there is no way to freedom.\"Don Juan still did not understand. But he began to wonder about his safety inlight of the man's obviously erratic mind. He was so concerned with thisunexpected development that he was not even curious about the use of the wordnagual. He knew that nagual meant sorcerer, yet he was unable to take in thetotal implication of the nagual Julian's words. Or perhaps, somehow, heunderstood it perfectly, although his conscious mind did not.The young man stared at him for a moment and then said that don Juan's actualjob would involve being his personal valet and assistant. There would be no payfor this, but excellent room and board.From time to time there would be other small jobs for don Juan; jobs requiringspecial attention. He was to be in charge of either doing the jobs himself orseeing that they got done. For these special services he would be paid smallamounts of money which would be put into an account kept for him by the othermembers of the household. Thus, should he ever want to leave, there would be asmall amount of cash to tide him over.The young man stressed that don Juan should not consider himself a prisoner, butthat if he stayed, he would have to work. And still more important than the workwere the three requirements he had to fulfill. He had to make a serious effortto learn everything the women taught him. His conduct with all the members ofthe household must be exemplary, which meant that he would have to examine hisbehavior and attitude toward them every minute of the day. And he was to addressthe young man, in direct conversation, as nagual, and when talking of him, torefer to him as the nagual Julian.Don Juan accepted the terms grudgingly. But although he instantly plunged intohis habitual sulkiness and moroseness, he learned his work quickly. What he didnot understand was what was expected of him in matters of attitude and behavior.And even though he could not have put his finger on a concrete instance, hehonestly believed that he was being lied to and exploited.As his moroseness got the upper hand, he entered into a permanent sulk andhardly said a word to anyone.It was then that the nagual Julian assembled all the members of his householdand explained to them that even though he badly needed an assistant, he wouldabide by their decision. If they did not like the morose and unappealingattitude of his new orderly, they had the right to say so. If the majoritydisapproved of don Juan's behavior, the young man would have to leave and takehis chances with whatever was waiting for him outside, be it a monster or hisown fabrication.The nagual Julian then led them to the front of the house and challenged donJuan to show them the monstrous man. Don Juan pointed him out, but no one elsesaw him. Don then ran frantically from one person to another, insisting that themonster was there, imploring them to help him. They ignored his pleas and calledhim crazy.It was then that the nagual Julian put don Juan's fate to vote. The unsociableman did not choose to vote. He shrugged his shoulders and walked away. All thewomen spoke out against don Juan's staying. They argued that he was simply toomorose and bad-tempered.During the heat of the argument, however, the nagual Julian completely changedhis attitude and became don Juan's defender. He suggested that the women mightbe misjudging the poor young man, that he was perhaps not crazy at all and maybeactually did see a monster. He said that perhaps his moroseness was the resultof his worries. And a great fight ensued. Tempers flared, and in no time thewomen were yelling at the nagual.Don Juan heard the argument but was past caring. He knew they were going tothrow him out and that the montrous man would certainly capture him and take himinto slavery. In his utter helplessness he began to weep.His despair and his tears swayed some of the enraged women. The leader of thewomen proposed another choice: a three-week trial period during which don Juan'sactions and attitude would be evaluated daily by all the women. She warned donJuan that if there was one single complaint about his attitude during that time,he would be kicked out for good.Don Juan recounted how the nagual Julian in a fatherly manner took him aside andproceeded to drive a wedge of ear into him. He whispered to don Juan that heknew for a fact that the monster not only existed but was roaming the property.Nevertheless, because of certain previous agreements with the women, agreementshe could not divulge, he was not permitted to tell the women what he knew. Heurged don Juan to stop demonstrating his stubborn, morose personality andpretend to be the opposite.\"Pretend to be happy and satisfied,\" he said to don Juan. \"If you don't, thewomen will kick you out. That prospect alone should be enough to scare you. Usethat fear as a real driving force. It's the only thing you have.\"Any hesitation or second thoughts that don Juan might have had were instantlydispelled at the sight of the monstrous man. As the monster waited impatientlyat the invisible line, he seemed aware of how precarious don Juan's positionwas. It was as if the monster were ravenously hungry, anxiously anticipating afeast.The nagual Julian drove his wedge of fear a bit deeper.\"If I were you,\" he told don Juan, \"I would behave like an angel. I'd act anyway these women want me to, as long as it kept me from that hellish beast.\"\"Then you do see the monster?\" don Juan asked.\"Of course I do,\" he replied. \"And I also see that if you leave, or if the womenkick you out, the monster will capture you and put you in chains. That willchange your attitude for sure. Slaves don't have any choice but to behave wellwith their masters. They say that the pain inflicted by a monster like that isbeyond anything.\"Don Juan knew that his only hope was to make himself as congenial [* congenial-suitable to needs or similar in nature] as he possibly could. The fear offalling prey to that monstrous man was indeed a powerful psychological force.Don Juan told me that by some quirk in his own nature he was boorish [* boorish-ill-mannered and coarse and contemptible in behaviour or appearance] only withthe women. He never behaved badly in the presence of the nagual Julian. For somereason that don Juan could not determine in his mind, the nagual was not someonehe could attempt to affect either consciously or subconsciously.The other member of the household, the unsociable man, was of no consequence todon Juan. Don Juan had formed an opinion the moment he met him, and haddiscounted him. He thought that the man was weak, indolent, and overpowered bythose beautiful women. Later on, when he was more aware of the nagual'spersonality, he knew that the man was definitely overshadowed by the glitter ofthe others.As time passed, the nature of leadership and authority among them became evidentto don Juan. He was surprised and somehow delighted to realize that no one wasbetter or higher than another. Some of them performed functions of which theothers were incapable, but that did not make them superior. It simply made themdifferent.However, the ultimate decision in everything was automatically the nagualJulian's, and he apparently took great pleasure in expressing his decisions inthe form of bestial jokes he played on everyone.There was also a mystery woman among them. They referred to her as Talia, thenagual woman. Nobody told don Juan who she was, or what being the nagual womanmeant. It was made clear to him, however, that one of the seven women was Talia.They all talked so much about her that don Juan's curiosity was aroused totremendous heights.He asked so many questions that the woman who was the leader of the other womentold him that she would teach him to read and write so that he might make betteruse of his deductive abilities. She said that he must learn to write things downrather than committing them to memory. In this fashion he would accumulate ahuge collection of facts about Talia; facts that he ought to read and studyuntil the truth became evident.Perhaps anticipating the cynical retort he had in mind, she argued that,although it might seem an absurd endeavor, finding out who Talia was was one ofthe most difficult and rewarding tasks anyone could undertake.That, she said, was the fun part. She added more seriously that it wasimperative for don Juan to learn basic bookkeeping in order to help the nagualmanage the property.Immediately she started daily lessons and in one year don Juan had progressed sorapidly and extensively that he was able to read, write, and keep account books.Everything had occurred so smoothly that he did not notice the changes inhimself; the most remarkable of which was a sense of detachment. As far as hewas concerned, he retained his impression that nothing was happening in thehouse simply because he still was unable to identify with the members of thehousehold. Those people were mirrors that did not yield reflection.\"I took refuge in that house for nearly three years,\" don Juan went on.\"Countless things happened to me during that time, but I didn't think they werereally important. Or at least I had chosen to consider them unimportant. I wasconvinced that for three years all I had done was hide, shake with fear, andwork like a mule.\"Don Juan laughed and told me that at one point, at the urging of the nagualJulian, he agreed to learn sorcery so that he might rid himself of the fear thatconsumed him each time he saw the monster keeping vigil. But although the nagualJulian talked to him a great deal, he seemed more interested in playing jokes onhim. So don Juan believed it was fair and accurate to say that he did not learnanything even loosely related to sorcery; simply because it was apparent thatnobody in that house knew or practiced sorcery.One day, however, he found himself walking purposefully, but without anyvolition [* volition- the capability of conscious choice and decision andintention] on his part, toward the invisible line that held the monster at bay.The monstrous man was, of course, watching the house as usual. But that day,instead of turning back and running to seek shelter inside the house, don Juankept walking. An incredible surge of energy made him advance with no concern forhis safety.A feeling of total detachment allowed him to face the monster that hadterrorized him for so many years. Don Juan expected the monster to lurch out andgrab him by the throat; but that thought no longer created any terror in him.From a distance of a few inches he stared at the monstrous man for an instantand then stepped over the line. And the monster did not attack him, as don Juanhad always feared he would, but became blurry. He lost his definition and turnedinto a misty whiteness; a barely perceptible patch of fog.Don Juan advanced toward the fog and it receded as if in fear. He chased thepatch of fog over the fields until he knew there was nothing left of themonster. He knew then that there had never been one. He could not, however,explain what he had feared. He had the vague sensation that although he knewexactly what the monster was, something was preventing him from thinking aboutit.He immediately thought that that rascal, the nagual Julian, knew the truth aboutwhat was happening. Don Juan would not have put it past the nagual Julian toplay that kind of trick.Before confronting him, don Juan gave himself the pleasure of walking unescortedall over the property. Never before had he been able to do that. Whenever he hadneeded to venture beyond that invisible line, he had been escorted by a memberof the household. That had put a serious constraint on his mobility. The two orthree times he had attempted to walk unescorted, he had found that he riskedannihilation at the hands of the monstrous being.Filled with a strange vigor, don Juan went into the house, but instead ofcelebrating his new freedom and power, he assembled the entire household andangrily demanded that they explain their lies. He accused them of making himwork as their slave by playing on his fear of a nonexistent monster.The women laughed as if he were telling the funniest joke. Only the nagualJulian seemed contrite, especially when don Juan, his voice cracking withresentment, described his three years of constant fear. The nagual Julian brokedown and wept openly as don Juan demanded an apology for the shameful way he hadbeen exploited.\"But we told you the monster didn't exist,\" one of the women said.Don Juan glared at the nagual Julian, who cowered meekly.\"He knew the monster existed,\" don Juan yelled, pointing an accusing finger atthe nagual.But at the same time he was aware he was talking nonsense, because the nagualJulian had originally told him that the monster did not exist.\"The monster didn't exist,\" don Juan corrected himself, shaking with rage. \"Itwas one of his tricks.\"The nagual Julian, weeping uncontrollably, apologized to don Juan, while thewomen howled with laughter. Don Juan had never seen them laughing so hard.\"You knew all along that there was never any monster. You lied to me,\" heaccused the nagual Julian, who, with his head down and his eyes filled withtears, admitted his guilt.\"I have certainly lied to you,\" he mumbled. \"There was never any monster. Whatyou saw as a monster was simply a surge of energy. Your fear made it into amonstrosity.\"\"You told me that that monster was going to devour me. How could you have liedto me like that?\" don Juan shouted at him.\"Being devoured by that monster was symbolic,\" the nagual Julian replied softly.\"Your real enemy is your stupidity. You are in mortal danger of being devouredby that monster now.\"Don Juan yelled that he did not have to put up with silly statements. And heinsisted they reassure him there were no longer any restrictions on his freedomto leave.\"You can go any time you want,\" the nagual Julian said curtly.\"You mean I can go right now?\" don Juan asked.\"Do you want to?\" the nagual asked.\"Of course, I want to leave this miserable place and the miserable bunch ofliars who live here,\" don Juan shouted.The nagual Julian ordered that don Juan's savings be paid him in full, and withshining eyes wished him happiness, prosperity, and wisdom.The women did not want to say goodbye to him. They stared at him until helowered his head to avoid their burning eyes.Don Juan put his money in his pocket and without a backward glance walked out;glad his ordeal was over. The outside world was a question mark to him. Heyearned for it. Inside that house he had been removed from it. He was young,strong. He had money in his pocket and a thirst for living.He left them without saying thank you. His anger, bottled up by his fear for solong, was finally able to surface. He had even learned to like the members ofthat household, and now he felt betrayed. He wanted to run as far away from thatplace as he could.In the city, he had his first unpleasant encounter. Traveling was very difficultand very expensive. He learned that if he wanted to leave the city at once hewould not be able to choose his destination, but would have to wait for whatevermuleteers were willing to take him. A few days later he left with a reputablemuleteer for the port of Mazatlan.\"Although I was only twenty-three years old at the time,\" don Juan said, \"I feltI had lived a full life. The only thing I had not experienced was sex. Thenagual Julian had told me that it was the fact I had not been with a woman thatgave me my strength and endurance, and that he had little time left to setthings up before the world would catch up with me.\"\"What did he mean, don Juan?\" I asked.\"He meant that I had no idea about the kind of hell I was heading for,\" don Juanreplied, \"and that he had very little time to set up my barricades; my silentprotectors.\"\"What's a silent protector, don Juan?\" I asked.\"It's a lifesaver,\" he said. \"A silent protector is a surge of inexplicableenergy that comes to a warrior when nothing else works.\"My benefactor knew what direction my life would take once I was no longer underhis influence. So he struggled to give me as many sorcerers' options aspossible. Those sorcerers' options were to be my silent protectors.\"\"What are sorcerers' options?\" I asked.\"Positions of the assemblage point,\" he replied, \"out of the infinite number ofpositions which the assemblage point can reach. In each and every one of thoseshallow or deep shifts, a sorcerer can strengthen his new continuity.\"He reiterated that everything he had experienced either with his benefactor orwhile under his guidance had been the result of either a minute or aconsiderable shift of his assemblage point. His benefactor had made himexperience countless sorcerers' options- more than the number that wouldnormally be necessary- because he knew that don Juan's destiny would be to becalled upon to explain what sorcerers were and what they did.\"The effect of those shifts of the assemblage point is cumulative,\" hecontinued. \"It weighs on you whether you understand it or not. That accumulationworked for me in the end.\"Very soon after I came into contact with the nagual, my point of assemblagemoved so profoundly that I was capable of seeing. I saw an energy field as amonster. And the point kept on moving until I saw the monster as what it reallywas: an energy field. I had succeeded in seeing, and I didn't know it. I thoughtI had done nothing; had learned nothing. I was stupid beyond belief.\"\"You were too young, don Juan,\" I said. \"You couldn't have done otherwise.\"He laughed. He was on the verge of replying, when he seemed to change his mind.He shrugged his shoulders and went on with his account.Don Juan said that when he arrived in Mazatlan he was practically a seasonedmuleteer, and was offered a permanent job running a mule train. He was verysatisfied with the arrangements. The idea that he would be making the tripbetween Durango and Mazatlan pleased him no end.There were two things, however, that bothered him: first, that he had not yetbeen with a woman; and second, a strong but unexplainable urge to go north. Hedid not know why. He knew only that somewhere to the north something was waitingfor him. The feeling persisted so strongly that in the end he was forced torefuse the security of a permanent job so he could travel north.His superior strength and a new and unaccountable cunning enabled him to findjobs even where there were none to be had as he steadily worked his way north tothe state of Sinaloa. And there his journey ended. He met a young widow who likehimself was a Yaqui Indian; and who had been the wife of a man to whom don Juanwas indebted.He attempted to repay his indebtedness by helping the widow and her children,and without being aware of it, he fell into the role of husband and father.His new responsibilities put a great burden on him. He lost his freedom ofmovement, and even his urge to journey farther north. He felt compensated forthat loss, however, by the profound affection he felt for the woman and herchildren.\"I experienced moments of sublime happiness as a husband and father,\" don Juansaid. \"But it was at those moments when I first noticed that something wasterribly wrong. I realized that I was losing the feeling of detachment- thealoofness I had acquired during my time in the nagual Julian's house. Now Ifound myself identifying with the people who surrounded me.\"Don Juan said that it took about a year of unrelenting abrasion to make him loseevery vestige of the new personality he had acquired at the nagual's house. Hehad begun with a profound yet aloof affection for the woman and her children.This detached affection allowed him to play the role of husband and father withabandon and gusto. As time went by, his detached affection turned into adesperate passion that made him lose his effectiveness.Gone was his feeling of detachment, which was what had given him the power tolove. Without that detachment, he had only mundane needs, desperation, andhopelessness; the distinctive features of the world of everyday life. Gone aswell was his enterprise. During his years at the nagual's house, he had acquireda dynamism that had served him well when he set out on his own.But the most draining pain was knowing that his physical energy had waned.Without actually being in ill health, one day he became totally paralyzed. Hedid not feel pain. He did not panic. It was as if his body had understood thathe would get the peace and quiet he so desperately needed only if it ceased tomove.As he lay helpless in bed, he did nothing but think. And he came to realize thathe had failed because he did not have an abstract purpose. He knew that thepeople in the nagual's house were extraordinary because they pursued freedom astheir abstract purpose. He did not understand what freedom was, but he knew thatit was the opposite of his own concrete needs.His lack of an abstract purpose had made him so weak and ineffective that he wasincapable of rescuing his adopted family from their abysmal poverty. Instead,they had pulled him back to the very misery, sadness, and despair which hehimself had known prior to encountering the nagual.As he reviewed his life, he became aware that the only time he had not been poorand had not had concrete needs was during his years with the nagual. Poverty wasthe state of being that had reclaimed him when his concrete needs overpoweredhim.For the first time since he had been shot and wounded so many years before, donJuan fully understood that the nagual Julian was indeed the nagual, the leader,and his benefactor. He understood what it was his benefactor had meant when hesaid to him that there was no freedom without the nagual's intervention. Therewas now no doubt in don Juan's mind that his benefactor and all the members ofhis benefactor's household were sorcerers. But what don Juan understood with themost painful clarity was that he had thrown away his chance to be with them.When the pressure of his physical helplessness seemed unendurable, his paralysisended as mysteriously as it had begun. One day he simply got out of bed and wentto work. But his luck did not get any better. He could hardly make ends meet.Another year passed. He did not prosper, but there was one thing in which hesucceeded beyond his expectations: he made a total recapitulation of his life.He understood then why he loved and could not leave those children, and why hecould not stay with them; and he also understood why he could neither act oneway nor the other.Don Juan knew that he had reached a complete impasse, and that to die like awarrior was the only action congruous with what he had learned at hisbenefactor's house. So every night, after a frustrating day of hardship andmeaningless toil, he patiently waited for his death to come.He was so utterly convinced of his end that his wife and her children waitedwith him- in a gesture of solidarity, they too wanted to die. All four sat inperfect immobility, night after night, without fail, and recapitulated theirlives while they waited for death.Don Juan had admonished them with the same words his benefactor had used toadmonish him.\"Don't wish for it,\" his benefactor had said. \"Just wait until it comes. Don'ttry to imagine what death is like. Just be there to be caught in its flow.\"The time spent quietly strengthened them mentally, but physically theiremaciated bodies told of their losing battle.One day, however, don Juan thought his luck was beginning to change. He foundtemporary work with a team of farm laborers during the harvest season. But thespirit had other designs for him. A couple of days after he started work,someone stole his hat. It was impossible for him to buy a new one, but he had tohave one to work under the scorching sun.He fashioned a protection of sorts by covering his head with rags and handfulsof straw. His coworkers began to laugh and taunt him. He ignored them. Comparedto the lives of the three people who depended on his labor, how he looked hadlittle meaning for him. But the men did not stop. They yelled and laughed untilthe foreman, fearing that they would riot, fired don Juan.A wild rage overwhelmed don Juan's sense of sobriety and caution. He knew he hadbeen wronged. The moral right was with him. He let out a chilling, piercingscream, and grabbed one of the men, and lifted him over his shoulders, meaningto crack his back. But he thought of those hungry children. He thought of theirdisciplined little bodies as they sat with him night after night awaiting death.He put the man down and walked away.Don Juan said that he sat down at the edge of the field where the men wereworking, and all the despair that had accumulated in him finally exploded. Itwas a silent rage, but not against the people around him. He raged againsthimself. He raged until all his anger was spent.\"I sat there in view of all those people and began to weep,\" don Juan continued.\"They looked at me as if I were crazy, which I really was, but I didn't care. Iwas beyond caring.\"The foreman felt sorry for me and came over to give a word of advice. Hethought I was weeping for myself. He couldn't have possibly known that I wasweeping for the spirit.\"Don Juan said that a silent protector came to him after his rage was spent. Itwas in the form of an unaccountable surge of energy that left him with the clearfeeling that his death was imminent. He knew that he was not going to have timeto see his adopted family again. He apologized to them in a loud voice for nothaving had the fortitude and wisdom necessary to deliver them from their hell onearth.The farm workers continued to laugh and mock him. He vaguely heard them. Tearsswelled in his chest as he addressed and thanked the spirit for having placedhim in the nagual's path, giving him an undeserved chance to be free. He heardthe howls of the uncomprehending men. He heard their insults and yells as iffrom within himself. They had the right to ridicule him. He had been at theportals of eternity and had been unaware of it.\"I understood how right my benefactor had been,\" don Juan said. \"My stupiditywas a monster and it had already devoured me. The instant I had that thought, Iknew that anything I could say or do was useless. I had lost my chance. Now, Iwas only clowning for those men. The spirit could not possibly have cared aboutmy despair. There were too many of us- men with our own petty private hells,born of our stupidity- for the spirit to pay attention.\"I knelt and faced the southeast. I thanked my benefactor again and told thespirit I was ashamed. So ashamed. And with my last breath I said goodbye to aworld which could have been wonderful if I had had wisdom. An immense wave camefor me then. I felt it, first. Then I heard it, and finally I saw it coming forme from the southeast, over the fields. It overtook me and its blackness coveredme. And the light of my life was gone. My hell had ended. I was finally dead! Iwas finally free!\" Don Juan's story devastated me. He ignored all my efforts to talk about it. Hesaid that at another time and in another setting we were going to discuss it. Hedemanded instead that we get on with what he had come to do: elucidate themastery of awareness.A couple of days later, as we were coming down from the mountains, he suddenlybegan to talk about his story. We had sat down to rest. Actually, I was the onewho had stopped to catch my breath. Don Juan was not even breathing hard. \"The sorcerers' struggle for assuredness is the most dramatic struggle thereis,\" don Juan said. \"It's painful and costly. Many, many times it has actuallycost sorcerers their lives.\"He explained that in order for any sorcerer to have complete certainty about hisactions, or about his position in the sorcerers' world, or to be capable ofutilizing intelligently his new continuity, he must invalidate the continuity ofhis old life. Only then can his actions have the necessary assuredness tofortify and balance the tenuousness and instability of his new continuity.\"The sorcerer seers of modern times call this process of invalidation the ticketto impeccability, or the sorcerers' symbolic but final death,\" don Juan said.\"And in that field in Sinaloa, I got my ticket to impeccability. I died there.The tenuousness of my new continuity cost me my life.\"\"But did you die, don Juan, or did you just faint?\" I asked, trying not to soundcynical.\"I died in that field,\" he said. \"I felt my awareness flowing out of me andheading toward the Eagle. But as I had impeccably recapitulated my life, theEagle did not swallow my awareness. The Eagle spat me out. Because my body wasdead in the field, the Eagle did not let me go through to freedom. It was as ifit told me to go back and try again.\"I ascended the heights of blackness and descended again to the light of theearth. And then I found myself in a shallow grave at the edge of the field,covered with rocks and dirt.\"Don Juan said that he knew instantly what to do. After digging himself out herearranged the grave to look as if a body were still there, and slipped away. Hefelt strong and determined. He knew that he had to return to his benefactor'shouse.But, before he started on his return journey, he wanted to see his family andexplain to them that he was a sorcerer and for that reason he could not staywith them. He wanted to explain that his downfall had been not knowing thatsorcerers can never make a bridge to join the people of the world. But, ifpeople desire to do so, they have to make a bridge to join sorcerers.\"I went home,\" don Juan continued, \"but the house was empty. The shockedneighbors told me that farm workers had come earlier with the news that I haddropped dead at work, and my wife and her children had left.\"\"How long were you dead, don Juan?\" I asked.\"A whole day, apparently,\" he said.Don Juan's smile played on his lips. His eyes seemed to be made of shinyobsidian. He was watching my reaction, waiting for my comments.\"What became of your family, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Ah, the question of a sensible man,\" he remarked. \"For a moment I thought youwere going to ask me about my death!\"I confessed that I had been about to, but that I knew he was seeing my questionas I formulated it in my mind, and just to be contrary I asked something else. Idid not mean it as a joke, but it made him laugh.\"My family disappeared that day,\" he said. \"My wife was a survivor. She had tobe, with the conditions we lived under. Since I had been waiting for my death,she believed I had gotten what I wanted. There was nothing for her to do there,so she left.\"I missed the children and I consoled myself with the thought that it wasn't myfate to be with them. However, sorcerers have a peculiar bent. They liveexclusively in the twilight of a feeling best described by the words \"andyet...\" When everything is crumbling down around them, sorcerers accept that thesituation is terrible, and then immediately escape to the twilight of \"andyet...\"\"I did that with my feelings for those children and the woman. With greatdiscipline- especially on the part of the oldest boy- they had recapitulatedtheir lives with me. Only the spirit could decide the outcome of thataffection.\"He reminded me that he had taught me how warriors acted in such situations. Theydid their utmost, and then, without any remorse or regrets, they relaxed and letthe spirit decide the outcome.\"What was the decision of the spirit, don Juan?\" I asked.He scrutinized me without answering. I knew he was completely aware of my motivefor asking. I had experienced a similar affection and a similar loss.\"The decision of the spirit is another basic core,\" he said. \"Sorcery storiesare built around it. We'll talk about that specific decision when we get todiscussing that basic core.\"Now, wasn't there a question about my death you wanted to ask?\"\"If they thought you were dead, why the shallow grave?\" I asked. \"Why didn'tthey dig a real grave and bury you?\"\"That's more like you,\" he said laughing. \"I asked the same question myself andI realized that all those farm workers were pious people. I was a Christian.Christians are not buried just like that, nor are they left to rot like dogs. Ithink they were waiting for my family to come and claim the body and give it aproper burial. But my family never came.\"\"Did you go and look for them, don Juan?\" I asked.\"No. Sorcerers never look for anyone,\" he replied. \"And I was a sorcerer. I hadpaid with my life for the mistake of not knowing I was a sorcerer, and thatsorcerers never approach anyone.\"From that day on, I have only accepted the company or the care of people orwarriors who are dead, as I am.\"Don Juan said that he went back to his benefactor's house where all of them knewinstantly what he had discovered. And they treated him as if he had not left atall.The nagual Julian commented that because of don Juan's peculiar nature he hadtaken a long time to die.\"My benefactor told me then that a sorcerer's ticket to freedom was his death,\"don Juan went on. \"He said that he himself had paid with his life for thatticket to freedom, as had everyone else in his household. And that now we wereequals in our condition of being dead.\"\"Am I dead too, don Juan?\" I asked.\"You are dead,\" he said. \"The sorcerers' grand trick, however, is to be awarethat they are dead. Their ticket to impeccability must be wrapped in awareness.In that wrapping, sorcerers say, their ticket is kept in mint condition.\"For sixty years, I've kept mine in mint condition.\" ================================================================= Part 6. Handling Intent"},{"pageContent":"The Third PointDon Juan often took me and the rest of his apprentices on short trips to thewestern range nearby. On this occasion we left at dawn, and late in theafternoon, started back. I chose to walk with don Juan. To be close to himalways soothed and relaxed me, whereas being with his volatile apprenticesalways produced in me the opposite effect: They made me feel very tired.As we all came down from the mountains, don Juan and I made one stop before wereached the flatlands. An attack of profound melancholy came upon me with suchspeed and strength that all I could do was to sit down. Then, following donJuan's suggestion, I lay on my stomach, on top of a large round boulder.The rest of the apprentices taunted me and continued walking. I heard theirlaughter and yelling become faint in the distance. Don Juan urged me to relaxand let my assemblage point, which he said had moved with sudden speed, settleinto its new position.\"Don't fret,\" he advised me. \"In a short while, you'll feel a sort of tug, or apat on your back, as if someone has touched you. Then you'll be fine.\"The act of lying motionless on the boulder, waiting to feel the pat on my back,triggered a spontaneous recollection so intense and clear that I never noticedthe pat I was expecting. I was sure, however, that I got it, because mymelancholy indeed vanished instantly.I quickly described what I was recollecting to don Juan. He suggested I stay onthe boulder and move my assemblage point back to the exact place it was when Iexperienced the event that I was recalling.\"Get every detail of it,\" he warned. It had happened many years before. Don Juan and I had been at that time in thestate of Chihuahua in northern Mexico, in the high desert. I used to go therewith him because it was an area rich in the medicinal herbs he collected.From an anthropological point of view that area also held a tremendous interestfor me. Archaeologists had found, not too long before, the remains of what theyconcluded was a large, prehistoric trading post. They surmised that the tradingpost, strategically situated in a natural passway, had been the epicenter ofcommerce along a trade route which joined the American Southwest to southernMexico and Central America.The few times I had been in that flat, high desert had reinforced my convictionthat archaeologists were right in their conclusions that it was a naturalpasskey. I, of course, had lectured don Juan on the influence of that passway inthe prehistoric distribution of cultural traits on the North American continent.I was deeply interested at that time in explaining sorcery among the Indians ofthe American Southwest, Mexico, and Central America as a system of beliefs whichhad been transmitted along trade routes and which had served to create, at acertain abstract level, a sort of pre-Columbian pan-Indianism.Don Juan, naturally, laughed uproariously every time I expounded my theories.The event that I recollected had begun in the midafternoon. After don Juan and Ihad gathered two small sacks of some extremely rare medicinal herbs, we took abreak and sat down on top of some huge boulders. But before we headed back towhere I had left my car, don Juan insisted on talking about the art of stalking.He said that the setting was the most adequate one for explaining itsintricacies, but that in order to understand them I first had to enter intoheightened awareness.I demanded that before he do anything he explain to me again what heightenedawareness really was.Don Juan, displaying great patience, discussed heightened awareness in terms ofthe movement of the assemblage point. As he kept talking, I realized thefacetiousness [* facetiousness- playful humour] of my request. I knew everythinghe was telling me. I remarked that I did not really need anything explained, andhe said that explanations were never wasted, because they were imprinted in usfor immediate or later use; or to help prepare our way to reaching silentknowledge.When I asked him to talk about silent knowledge in more detail, he quicklyresponded that silent knowledge was a general position of the assemblage point,that ages ago it had been man's normal position, but that, for reasons whichwould be impossible to determine, man's assemblage point had moved away fromthat specific location and adopted a new one called \"reason.\"Don Juan remarked that not every human being was a representative of this newposition. The assemblage points of the majority of us were not placed squarelyon the location of reason itself, but in its immediate vicinity. The same thinghad been the case with silent knowledge: not every human being's assemblagepoint had been squarely on that location either.He also said that 'the place of no pity', being another position of theassemblage point, was the forerunner of silent knowledge, and that yet anotherposition of the assemblage point called 'the place of concern', was theforerunner of reason.I found nothing obscure about those cryptic remarks. To me they wereself-explanatory. I understood everything he said while I waited for his usualblow to my shoulder blades to make me enter into heightened awareness. But theblow never came, and I kept on understanding what he was saying without reallybeing aware that I understood anything. The feeling of ease, of taking thingsfor granted, proper to my normal consciousness, remained with me, and I did notquestion my capacity to understand.Don Juan looked at me fixedly and recommended that I lie face down on top of around boulder with my arms and legs spread like a frog.I lay there for about ten minutes, thoroughly relaxed, almost asleep, until Iwas jolted out of my slumber by a soft, sustained hissing growl. I raised myhead, looked up, and my hair stood on end. A gigantic, dark jaguar was squattingon a boulder, scarcely ten feet from me, right above where don Juan was sitting.The jaguar, its fangs showing, was glaring straight at me. He seemed ready tojump on me,\"Don't move!\" don Juan ordered me softly. \"And don't look at his eyes. Stare athis nose and don't blink. Your life depends on your stare.\"I did what he told me. The jaguar and I stared at each other for a moment untildon Juan broke the standoff by hurling his hat, like a frisbee, at the jaguar'shead. The jaguar jumped back to avoid being hit, and don Juan let out a loud,prolonged, and piercing whistle. He then yelled at the top of his voice andclapped his hands two or three times. It sounded like muffled gunshots.Don Juan signaled me to come down from the boulder and join him. The two of usyelled and clapped our hands until he decided we had scared the jaguar away.My body was shaking, yet I was not frightened. I told don Juan that what hadcaused me the greatest fear had not been the cat's sudden growl or his stare,but the certainty that the jaguar had been staring at me long before I had heardhim and lifted my head.Don Juan did not say a word about the experience. He was deep in thought. When Ibegan to ask him if he had seen the jaguar before I had, he made an imperiousgesture to quiet me. He gave me the impression he was ill at ease or evenconfused.After a moment's silence, don Juan signaled me to start walking. He took thelead. We walked away from the rocks, zigzagging at a fast pace through the bush.After about half an hour we reached a clearing in the chaparral where we stoppedto rest for a moment. We had not said a single word and I was eager to know whatdon Juan was thinking.\"Why are we walking in this pattern?\" I asked. \"Wouldn't it be better to make abeeline out of here, and fast?\"\"No!\" he said emphatically. \"It wouldn't be any good. That one is a male jaguar.He's hungry and he's going to come after us.\"\"All the more reason to get out of here fast,\" I insisted.\"It's not so easy,\" he said. \"That jaguar is not encumbered by reason. He'llknow exactly what to do to get us. And as sure as I am talking to you, he'llread our thoughts.\"\"What do you mean, the jaguar reading our thoughts?\" I asked.\"That is no metaphorical statement,\" he said. \"I mean what I say. Big animalslike that have the capacity to read thoughts. And I don't mean guess. I meanthat they know everything directly.\"\"What can we do then?\" I asked, truly alarmed.\"We ought to become less rational and try to win the battle by making itimpossible for the jaguar to read us,\" he replied.\"How would being less rational help us?\" I asked.\"Reason makes us choose what seems sound to the mind,\" he said. \"For instance,your reason already told you to run as fast as you can in a straight line. Whatyour reason failed to consider is that we would have had to run about six milesbefore reaching the safety of your car. And the jaguar will outrun us. He'll cutin front of us and be waiting in the most appropriate place to jump us.\"A better but less rational choice is to zigzag.\"\"How do you know that it's better, don Juan?\" I asked.\"I know it because my connection to the spirit is very clear,\" he replied. \"Thatis to say, my assemblage point is at the place of silent knowledge. From there Ican discern that this is a hungry jaguar, but not one that has already eatenhumans. And he's baffled by our actions. If we zigzag now, the jaguar will haveto make an effort to anticipate us.\"\"Are there any other choices beside zigzagging?\" I asked.\"There are only rational choices,\" he said. \"And we don't have all the equipmentwe need to back up rational choices. For example, we can head for the highground, but we would need a gun to hold it.\"We must match the jaguar's choices. Those choices are dictated by silentknowledge. We must do what silent knowledge tells us, regardless of howunreasonable it may seem.\"He began his zigzagging trot. I followed him very closely, but I had noconfidence that running like that would save us. I was having a delayed panicreaction. The thought of the dark, looming shape of the enormous cat obsessedme.The desert chaparral consisted of tall, ragged bushes spaced four or five feetapart. The limited rainfall in the high desert did not allow the growth ofplants with thick foliage or of dense underbrush. Yet the visual effect of thechaparral was of thickness and impenetrable growth.Don Juan moved with extraordinary nimbleness and I followed as best as I could.He suggested that I watch where I stepped and make less noise. He said that thesound of branches cracking under my weight was a dead giveaway.I deliberately tried to step in don Juan's tracks to avoid breaking drybranches. We zigzagged about a hundred yards in this manner before I caughtsight of the jaguar's enormous dark mass no more than thirty feet behind me.I yelled at the top of my voice. Without stopping, don Juan turned aroundquickly enough to see the big cat move out of sight. Don Juan let out anotherpiercing whistle and kept clapping his hands, imitating the sound of muffledgunshots.In a very low voice he said that cats did not like to go uphill and so we weregoing to cross, at top speed, the wide and deep ravine a few yards to my right.He gave a signal to go and we thrashed through the bushes as fast as we could.We slid down one side of the ravine, reached the bottom, and rushed up the otherside. From there we had a clear view of the slope, the bottom of the ravine, andthe level ground where we had been. Don Juan whispered that the jaguar wasfollowing our scent, and that if we were lucky we would see him running to thebottom of the ravine, close to our tracks.Gazing fixedly at the ravine below us, I waited anxiously to catch a glimpse ofthe animal. But I did not see him. I was beginning to think the jaguar mighthave run away when I heard the frightening growling of the big cat in thechaparral just behind us. I had the chilling realization that don Juan had beenright. To get to where he was, the jaguar must have read our thoughts andcrossed the ravine before we had.Without uttering a single word, don Juan began running at a formidable speed. Ifollowed and we zigzagged for quite a while. I was totally out of breath when westopped to rest.The fear of being chased by the jaguar had not, however, prevented me fromadmiring don Juan's superb physical prowess. He had run as if he were a youngman. I began to tell him that he had reminded me of someone in my childhood whohad impressed me deeply with his running ability, but he signaled me to stoptalking. He listened attentively and so did I.I heard a soft rustling in the underbrush, right ahead of us. And then the blacksilhouette of the jaguar was visible for an instant at a spot in the chaparralperhaps fifty yards from us.Don Juan shrugged his shoulders and pointed in the direction of the animal.\"It looks like we're not going to shake him off,\" he said with a tone ofresignation. \"Let's walk calmly, as if we were taking a nice stroll in the park,and you tell me the story of your childhood. This is the right time and theright setting for it. A jaguar is after us with a ravenous appetite, and you arereminiscing about your past: the perfect not-doing for being chased by ajaguar.\"He laughed loudly. But when I told him I had completely lost interest in tellingthe story, he doubled up with laughter.\"You are punishing me now for not wanting to listen to you, aren't you?\" heasked.And I, of course, began to defend myself. I told him his accusation wasdefinitely absurd. I really had lost the thread of the story.\"If a sorcerer doesn't have self-importance, he doesn't give a rat's ass abouthaving lost the thread of a story,\" he said with a malicious shine in his eyes.\"Since you don't have any self-importance left, you should tell your story now.Tell it to the spirit, to the jaguar, and to me, as if you hadn't lost thethread at all.\"I wanted to tell him that I did not feel like complying with his wishes, becausethe story was too stupid and the setting was overwhelming. I wanted to pick theappropriate setting for it, some other time, as he himself did with his stories.Before I voiced my opinions, he answered me.\"Both the jaguar and I can read thoughts,\" he said, smiling. \"If I choose theproper setting and time for my sorcery stories, it's because they are forteaching and I want to get the maximum effect from them.\"He signaled me to start walking. We walked calmly, side by side. I said I hadadmired his running and his stamina, and that a bit of self-importance was atthe core of my admiration, because I considered myself a good runner.Then I told him the story from my childhood I had remembered when I saw himrunning so well. I told him I had played soccer as a boy and had run extremely well. In fact, Iwas so agile and fast that I felt I could commit any prank with impunity becauseI would be able to outrun anyone chasing me, especially the old policemen whopatrolled the streets of my hometown on foot. If I broke a street light orsomething of the sort, all I had to do was to take off running and I was safe.But one day, unbeknownst to me, the old policemen were replaced by a new policecorps with military training. The disastrous moment came when I broke a Storewindow and ran; confident that my speed was my safeguard.A young policeman took off after me. I ran as I had never run before, but it wasto no avail. The officer, who was a crack center forward on the police soccerteam, had more speed and stamina than my ten-year-old body could manage. Hecaught me and kicked me all the way back to the store with the broken window.Very artfully he named off all his kicks, as if he were training on a soccerfield. He did not hurt me, he only scared me spitless, yet my intensehumiliation was tempered by a ten-year-old's admiration for his prowess and histalent as a soccer player.I told don Juan that I had felt the same with him that day. He was able tooutrun me in spite of our age difference and my old proclivity for speedygetaways.I also told him that for years I had been having a recurrent dream in which Iran so well that the young policeman was no longer able to overtake me.\"Your story is more important than I thought,\" don Juan commented. \"I thought itwas going to be a story about your mama spanking you.\"The way he emphasized his words made his statement very funny and very mocking.He added that at certain times it was the spirit, and not our reason, whichdecided on our stories. This was one of those times. The spirit had triggeredthis particular story in my mind, doubtlessly because the story was concernedwith my indestructible self-importance. He said that the torch of anger andhumiliation had burned in me for years, and my feelings of failure and dejectionwere still intact.\"A psychologist would have a field day with your story and its present context,\"he went on. \"In your mind, I must be identified with the young policeman whoshattered your notion of invincibility.\"Now that he mentioned it, I had to admit that that had been my feeling, althoughI would not consciously have thought of it, much less voiced it. We walked in silence. I was so touched by his analogy that I completely forgotthe jaguar stalking us, until a wild growl reminded me of our situation.Don Juan directed me to jump up and down on the long, low branches of the shrubsand break off a couple of them to make a sort of long broom. He did the same. Aswe ran, we used them to raise a cloud of dust, stirring and kicking the dry,sandy dirt.\"That ought to worry the jaguar,\" he said when we stopped again to catch ourbreath. \"We have only a few hours of daylight left. At night the jaguar isunbeatable, so we had better start running straight toward those rocky hills.\"He pointed to some hills in the distance, perhaps half a mile south.\"We've got to go east,\" I said. \"Those hills are too far south. If we go thatway, we'll never get to my car.\"\"We won't get to your car today, anyway,\" he said calmly. \"And perhaps nottomorrow either. Who is to say we'll ever get back to it?\"I felt a pang of fear, and then a strange peace took possession of me. I tolddon Juan that if death was going to take me in that desert chaparral I hoped itwould be painless.\"Don't worry,\" he said. \"Death is painful only when it happens in one's bed, insickness. In a fight for your life, you feel no pain. If you feel anything, it'sexultation.\"He said that one of the most dramatic differences between civilized men andsorcerers was the way in which death came to them. Only with sorcerer-warriorswas death kind and sweet. They could be mortally wounded and yet would feel nopain. And what was even more extraordinary was that death held itself inabeyance for as long as the sorcerers needed it to do so.\"The greatest difference between an average man and a sorcerer is that asorcerer commands his death with his speed,\" don Juan went on. \"If it comes tothat, the jaguar will not eat me. He'll eat you, because you don't have thespeed to hold back your death.\"He then elaborated on the intricacies of the sorcerers' idea of speed and death.He said that in the world of everyday life, our word or our decisions could bereversed very easily. The only irrevocable thing in our world was death. In thesorcerers' world, on the other hand, normal death could be countermanded, butnot the sorcerers' word. In the sorcerers' world decisions could not be changedor revised. Once they had been made, they stood forever.I told don Juan that his statements, impressive as they were, could not convinceme that death could be revoked; and he explained once more what he had explainedbefore.He said that for a seer, human beings were either oblong or spherical luminousmasses of countless, static, yet vibrant fields of energy; and that onlysorcerers were capable of injecting movement into those spheres of staticluminosity.In a millisecond they could move their assemblage points to any place in theirluminous mass. That movement and the speed with which it is performed entailedan instantaneous shift into the perception of another totally differentuniverse.Or they could move their assemblage points, without stopping, across theirentire fields of luminous energy. The force created by such movement was sointense that it instantly consumed their whole luminous mass.He said that if a rockslide were to come crashing down on us at that precisemoment, he would be able to cancel the normal effect of an accidental death. Byusing the speed with which his assemblage point would move, he could makehimself change universes or make himself burn from within in a fraction of asecond. I, on the other hand, would die a normal death, crushed by the rocks,because my assemblage point lacked the speed to pull me out.I said it seemed to me that the sorcerers had just found an alternative way ofdying, which was not the same as a cancellation of death. And he replied thatall he had said was that sorcerers commanded their deaths. They died only whenthey had to.Although I did not doubt what he was saying, I kept asking questions, almost asa game. But while he was talking, thoughts and unanchored memories about otherperceivable universes were forming in my mind, as if on a screen.I told don Juan I was thinking strange thoughts. He laughed and recommended Istick to the jaguar, because he was so real that he could only be a truemanifestation of the spirit.The idea of how real the animal was made me shudder.\"Wouldn't it be better if we changed direction instead of heading straight forthe hills?\" I asked.I thought that we could create a certain confusion in the jaguar with anunexpected change.\"It's too late to change direction,\" don Juan said. \"The jaguar already knowsthat there is no place for us to go but the hills.\"\"That can't be true, don Juan!\" I exclaimed.\"Why not?\" he asked.I told him that although I could attest to the animal's ability to be one jumpahead of us, I could not quite accept that the jaguar had the foresight tofigure out where we wanted to go.\"Your error is to think of the jaguar's power in terms of his capacity to figurethings out,\" he said. \"He can't think. He only knows.\"Don Juan said that our dust-raising maneuver was to confuse the jaguar by givinghim sensory input on something for which we had no use. We could not develop areal feeling for raising dust though our lives depended on it.\"I truly don't understand what you are saying,\" I whined.Tension was taking its toll on me. I was having a hard time concentrating.Don Juan explained that human feelings were like hot or cold currents of air andcould easily be detected by a beast. We were the senders, the jaguar was thereceiver. Whatever feelings we had would find their way to the jaguar. Orrather, the jaguar could read any feelings that had a history of use for us. Inthe case of the dust-raising maneuver, the feeling we had about it was so out ofthe ordinary that it could only create a vacuum in the receiver.\"Another maneuver silent knowledge might dictate would be to kick up dirt,\" donJuan said.He looked at me for an instant as if he were waiting for my reactions.\"We are going to walk very calmly now,\" he said. \"And you are going to kick updirt as if you were a ten-foot giant.\"I must have had a stupid expression on my face. Don Juan's body shook withlaughter.\"Raise a cloud of dust with your feet,\" he ordered me. \"Feel huge and heavy.\"I tried it and immediately had a sense of massiveness. In a joking tone, Icommented that his power of suggestion was incredible. I actually felt giganticand ferocious. He assured me that my feeling of size was not in any way theproduct of his suggestion, but the product of a shift of my assemblage point.He said that men of antiquity became legendary because they knew by silentknowledge about the power to be obtained by moving the assemblage point. On areduced scale, sorcerers had recaptured that old power. With a movement of theirassemblage points, they could manipulate their feelings and change things. I waschanging things by feeling big and ferocious. Feelings processed in that fashionwere called intent.\"Your assemblage point has already moved quite a bit,\" he went on. \"Now you arein the position of either losing your gain, or making your assemblage point movebeyond the place where it is now.\"He said that possibly every human being under normal living conditions had hadat one time or another the opportunity to break away from the bindings ofconvention. He stressed that he did not mean social convention, but theconventions binding our perception.A moment of elation would suffice to move our assemblage points and break ourconventions. So, too, a moment of fright, ill health, anger, or grief. Butordinarily, whenever we had the chance to move our assemblage points we becamefrightened. Our religious, academic, and social backgrounds would come intoplay. They would assure our safe return to the flock; the return of ourassemblage points to the prescribed position of normal living.He told me that all the mystics and spiritual teachers I knew of had done justthat: Their assemblage points moved, either through discipline or accident, to acertain point; and then they returned to normalcy carrying a memory that lastedthem a lifetime.\"You can be a very pious, good boy,\" he went on, \"and forget about the initialmovement of your assemblage point. Or you can push beyond your reasonablelimits. You are still within those limits.\"I knew what he was talking about, yet there was a strange hesitation in memaking me vacillate.Don Juan pushed his argument further. He said that the average man, incapable offinding the energy to perceive beyond his daily limits, called the realm ofextraordinary perception sorcery, witchcraft, or the work of the devil, andshied away from it without examining it further.\"But you can't do that anymore,\" don Juan went on. \"You are not religious andyou are much too curious to discard anything so easily. The only thing thatcould stop you now is cowardice.\"Turn everything into what it really is: the abstract, the spirit, the nagual.There is no witchcraft, no evil, no devil. There is only perception.\"I understood him. But I could not tell exactly what he wanted me to do.I looked at don Juan, trying to find the most appropriate words. I seemed tohave entered into an extremely functional frame of mind and did not want towaste a single word.\"Be gigantic!\" he ordered me, smiling. \"Do away with reason.\"Then I knew exactly what he meant. In fact, I knew that I could increase theintensity of my feelings of size and ferociousness until I actually could be agiant, hovering over the shrubs, seeing all around us.I tried to voice my thoughts but quickly gave up. I became aware that don Juanknew all I was thinking, and obviously much, much more.And then something extraordinary happened to me. My reasoning faculties ceasedto function. Literally I felt as though a dark blanket had covered me andobscured my thoughts. I let go of my reason with the abandon of one who doesn'thave a worry in the world. I was convinced that if I wanted to dispel theobscuring blanket, all I had to do was feel myself breaking through it.In that state, I felt I was being propelled; set in motion. Something was makingme move physically from one place to another. I did not experience any fatigue.The speed and ease with which I could move elated me.I did not feel I was walking; I was not flying either. Rather I was beingtransported with extreme facility. My movements became jerky and ungraceful onlywhen I tried to think about them. When I enjoyed them without thought, I enteredinto a unique state of physical elation for which I had no precedent.If I had had instances of that kind of physical happiness in my life, they musthave been so short-lived that they had left no memory. Yet when I experiencedthat ecstasy I felt a vague recognition, as if I had once known it but hadforgotten.The exhilaration of moving through the chaparral was so intense that everythingelse ceased. The only things that existed for me were those periods ofexhilaration and the moments when I would stop moving and find myself facing thechaparral.But even more inexplicable was the total bodily sensation of looming over thebushes which I had had since the instant I started to move.At one moment, I clearly saw the figure of the jaguar up ahead of me. He wasrunning away as fast as he could. I felt that he was trying to avoid the spinesof the cactuses. He was being extremely careful about where he stepped.I had the overwhelming urge to run after the jaguar and scare him into losinghis caution. I knew that he would get pricked by the spines. A thought thenerupted in my silent mind- I thought that the jaguar would be a more dangerousanimal if he was hurt by the spines. That thought produced the same effect assomeone waking me from a dream.When I became aware that my thinking processes were functioning again, I foundthat I was at the base of a low range of rocky hills. I looked around. Don Juanwas a few feet away. He seemed exhausted. He was pale and breathing very hard.\"What happened, don Juan?\" I asked, after clearing my raspy throat.\"You tell me what happened,\" he gasped between breaths.I told him what I had felt. Then I realized that I could barely see the top ofthe mountain directly in my line of vision. There was very little daylight left,which meant I had been running, or walking, for more than two hours.I asked don Juan to explain the time discrepancy. He said that my assemblagepoint had moved beyond the place of no pity into the place of silent knowledge,but that I still lacked the energy to manipulate it myself. To manipulate itmyself meant I would have to have enough energy to move between reason andsilent knowledge at will. He added that if a sorcerer had enough energy- or evenif he did not have sufficient energy but needed to shift because it was a matterof life and death- he could fluctuate between reason and silent knowledge.His conclusions about me were that because of the seriousness of our situation,I had let the spirit move my assemblage point. The result had been my enteringinto silent knowledge. Naturally, the scope of my perception had increased,which gave me the feeling of height, of looming over the bushes.At that time, because of my academic training, I was passionately interested invalidation by consensus. I asked him my standard question of those days.\"If someone from UCLA's Anthropology Department had been watching me, would hehave seen me as a giant thrashing through the chaparral?\"\"I really don't know,\" don Juan said. \"The way to find out would be to move yourassemblage point when you are in the Department of Anthropology.\"\"I have tried,\" I said. \"But nothing ever happens. I must need to have youaround for anything to take place.\"\"It was not a matter of life and death for you then,\" he said. \"If it had been,you would have moved your assemblage point all by yourself.\"\"But would people see what I see when my assemblage point moves?\" I insisted.\"No, because their assemblage points won't be in the same place as yours,\" hereplied.\"Then, don Juan, did I dream the jaguar?\" I asked. \"Did all of it happen only inmy mind?\"\"Not quite,\" he said. \"That big cat is real. You have moved miles and you arenot even tired. If you are in doubt, look at your shoes. They are full of cactusspines. So you did move, looming over the shrubs. And at the same time youdidn't. It depends on whether one's assemblage point is on the place of reasonor on the place of silent knowledge.\"I understood everything he was saying while he said it, but could not repeat anypart of it at will. Nor could I determine what it was I knew, or why he wasmaking so much sense to me.The growl of the jaguar brought me back to the reality of the immediate danger.I caught sight of the jaguar's dark mass as he swiftly moved uphill about thirtyyards to our right.\"What are we going to do, don Juan?\" I asked, knowing that he had also seen theanimal moving ahead of us.\"Keep climbing to the very top and seek shelter there,\" he said calmly.Then he added, as if he had not a single worry in the world, that I had wastedvaluable time indulging in my pleasure at looming over the bushes. Instead ofheading for the safety of the hills he had pointed out, I had taken off towardthe easterly higher mountains.\"We must reach that scarp before the jaguar or we don't have a chance,\" he said,pointing to the nearly vertical face at the very top of the mountain.I turned right and saw the jaguar leaping from rock to rock. He was definitelyworking his way over to cut us off.\"Let's go, don Juan!\" I yelled out of nervousness.Don Juan smiled. He seemed to be enjoying my fear and impatience. We moved asfast as we could and climbed steadily. I tried not to pay attention to the darkform of the jaguar as it appeared from time to time a bit ahead of us and alwaysto our right.The three of us reached the base of the escarpment at the same time. The jaguarwas about twenty yards to our right. He jumped and tried to climb the face ofthe cliff, but failed. The rock wall was too steep.Don Juan yelled that I should not waste time watching the jaguar, because hewould charge as soon as he gave up trying to climb. No sooner had don Juanspoken than the animal charged.There was no time for further urging. I scrambled up the rock wall followed bydon Juan. The shrill scream of the frustrated beast sounded right by the heel ofmy right foot. The propelling force of fear sent me up the slick scarp as if Iwere a fly.I reached the top before don Juan, who had stopped to laugh.Safe at the top of the cliff, I had more time to think about what had happened.Don Juan did not want to discuss anything. He argued that at this stage in mydevelopment, any movement of my assemblage point would still be a mystery. Mychallenge at the beginning of my apprenticeship was, he said, maintaining mygains, rather than reasoning them out- and that at some point everything wouldmake sense to me.I told him everything made sense to me at that moment. But he was adamant that Ihad to be able to explain knowledge to myself before I could claim that it madesense to me. He insisted that for a movement of my assemblage point to makesense, I would need to have energy to fluctuate from the place of reason to theplace of silent knowledge.He stayed quiet for a while, sweeping my entire body with his stare. Then heseemed to make up his mind and smiled and began to speak again.\"Today you reached the place of silent knowledge,\" he said with finality.He explained that that afternoon, my assemblage point had moved by itself,without his intervention. I had intended the movement by manipulating my feelingof being gigantic, and in so doing my assemblage point had reached the positionof silent knowledge.I was very curious to hear how don Juan interpreted my experience. He said thatone way to talk about the perception attained in the place of silent knowledgewas to call it \"here and here.\" He explained that when I had told him I had feltmyself looming over the desert chaparral, I should have added that I was seeingthe desert floor and the top of the shrubs at the same time. Or that I had beenat the place where I stood and at the same time at the place where the jaguarwas. Thus I had been able to notice how carefully he stepped to avoid the cactusspines. In other words, instead of perceiving the normal here and there, I hadperceived \"here and here.\"His comments frightened me. He was right. I had not mentioned that to him, norhad I admitted even to myself that I had been in two places at once. I would nothave dared to think in those terms had it not been for his comments.He repeated that I needed more time and more energy to make sense of everything.I was too new; I still required a great deal of supervision. For instance, whileI was looming over the shrubs, he had to make his assemblage point fluctuaterapidly between the places of reason and silent knowledge to take care of me.And that had exhausted him.\"Tell me one thing,\" I said, testing his reasonableness. \"That jaguar wasstranger than you want to admit, wasn't it? Jaguars are not part of the fauna [*fauna- all the animal life in a particular region or period] of this area.Pumas, yes, but not jaguars. How do you explain that?\"Before answering, he puckered his face. He was suddenly very serious.\"I think that this particular jaguar confirms your anthropological theories,\" hesaid in a solemn tone. \"Obviously, the jaguar was following this famous traderoute connecting Chihuahua with Central America.\"Don Juan laughed so hard that the sound of his laughter echoed in the mountains.That echo disturbed me as much as the jaguar had. Yet it was not the echo itselfwhich disturbed me, but the fact that I had never heard an echo at night. Echoeswere, in my mind, associated only with the daytime. It had taken me several hours to recall all the details of my experience withthe jaguar. During that time, don Juan had not talked to me. He had simplypropped himself against a rock and gone to sleep in a sitting position. After awhile I no longer noticed that he was there, and finally I fell asleep.I was awakened by a pain in my jaw. I had been sleeping with the side of my facepressed against a rock. The moment I opened my eyes, I tried to slide down offthe boulder on which I had been lying, but lost my balance and fell noisily onmy seat. Don Juan appeared from behind some bushes just in time to laugh.It was getting late and I wondered aloud if we had enough time to get to thevalley before nightfall. Don Juan shrugged his shoulders and did not seemconcerned. He sat down beside me.I asked him if he wanted to hear the details of my recollection. He indicatedthat it was fine with him, yet he did not ask me any questions. I thought he wasleaving it up to me to start, so I told him there were three points I rememberedwhich were of great importance to me.One was that he had talked about silent knowledge; another was that I had movedmy assemblage point using intent; and the final point was that I had enteredinto heightened awareness without requiring a blow between my shoulder blades.Don Juan said, \"Intending the movement of your assemblage point was yourgreatest accomplishment. But accomplishment is something personal.Accomplishment is necessary, but it's not the important part. Accomplishment isnot the residue sorcerers look forward to.\"I thought I knew what he wanted. I told him that I hadn't totally forgotten theevent. What had remained with me in my normal state of awareness was that amountain lion- since I could not accept the idea of a jaguar- had chased us up amountain; and that don Juan had asked me if I had felt offended by the big cat'sonslaught. I had assured him that it was absurd that I could feel offended, andhe had told me I should feel the same way about the onslaughts of my fellow men.I should protect myself, or get out of their way, but without feeling morallywronged.\"That is not the residue I am talking about,\" he said, laughing. \"The idea ofthe abstract, the spirit, is the only residue that is important. The idea of thepersonal self has no value whatsoever. You still put yourself and your ownfeelings first. Every time I've had the chance, I have made you aware of theneed to abstract. You have always believed that I meant to think abstractly. No.To abstract means to make yourself available to the spirit by being aware ofit.\"He said that one of the most dramatic things about the human condition was themacabre [* macabre- shockingly repellent; inspiring horror] connection betweenstupidity and self-reflection.It is stupidity that forces us to discard anything that does not conform withour self-reflective expectations. For example, as average men we are blind tothe most crucial piece of knowledge available to a human being: the existence ofthe assemblage point and the fact that it could move.\"For a rational man,\" he went on, \"it's unthinkable that there is an invisiblepoint where perception is assembled. And yet more unthinkable that such a pointis not in the brain, as he might vaguely expect it to be; if he were given toentertaining the thought of its existence.\"He added that for the rational man to hold steadfastly to his self-image insuredhis abysmal [* abysmal- very great; limitless] ignorance.The average man ignored, for instance, the fact that sorcery was notincantations and hocus-pocus, but the freedom to perceive not only the worldtaken for granted, but every thing else that was humanly possible.\"Here is where the average man's stupidity is most dangerous,\" he continued. \"Heis afraid of sorcery. He trembles at the possibility of freedom. And freedom isat his fingertips. It's called the third point. And it can be reached as easilyas the assemblage point can be made to move.\"I protested saying, \"But you yourself told me that moving the assemblage pointis so difficult that it is a true accomplishment.\"\"It is,\" he assured me. \"This is another of the sorcerers' contradictions:Moving it is very difficult and yet it's the simplest thing in the world. I'vetold you already that a high fever could move the assemblage point. Hunger orfear or love or hate could do it; mysticism too.\"Unbending intent can also move the assemblage point, and is the preferredmethod of sorcerers.\"I asked him to explain again what unbending intent was.He said that it was a sort of single-mindedness human beings exhibit; anextremely well-defined purpose not countermanded by any conflicting interests ordesires.Unbending intent was also the force engendered [* engendered- called forth] whenthe assemblage point was maintained fixed in a position which was not the usualone.Don Juan then made a meaningful distinction which had eluded me all these yearsbetween a movement and a shift of the assemblage point.He said a movement was a profound change of position so extreme that theassemblage point might even reach other bands of energy within our totalluminous mass of energy fields: Each band of energy represented a completelydifferent universe to be perceived.A shift, however, was a small movement within the band of energy fields weperceived as the world of everyday life.He went on to say that sorcerers saw unbending intent as the catalyst to triggertheir unchangeable decisions: Or as the converse, their unchangeable decisionswere the catalyst that propelled their assemblage points to new positions whichin turn generated unbending intent.I must have looked dumbfounded. Don Juan laughed and said that trying to reasonout the sorcerers' metaphorical descriptions was as useless as trying to reasonout silent knowledge. He added that the problem with words was that any attemptto clarify the sorcerers' description only made them more confusing.I urged him to try to clarify this in any way he could. I argued that anythinghe could say, for instance, about the third point could only clarify it, foralthough I knew everything about it, it was still very confusing.\"The world of daily life consists of two points of reference,\" he said. \"We havefor example, here and there, in and out, up and down, good and evil, and so onand so forth. So, properly speaking, our perception of our lives istwo-dimensional. None of what we perceive ourselves doing has 'depth'.\"I protested that he was mixing levels. I told him that I could accept hisdefinition of perception as the capacity of living beings to apprehend withtheir senses fields of energy selected by their assemblage points- a veryfarfetched definition by my academic standards, but one that, at the moment,seemed cogent. [* cogent- powerfully persuasive]However, I could not imagine what the 'depth' of what we do might be. I arguedthat it was possible he was talking about interpretations- elaborations of ourbasic perceptions.\"A sorcerer perceives his actions with depth,\" he said. \"His actions aretri-dimensional for him. They have a third point of reference.\"\"How could a third point of reference exist?\" I asked with a tinge of annoyance.He said, \"Our points of reference are obtained primarily from our senseperception. Our senses perceive and differentiate what is immediate to us fromwhat is not. Using that basic distinction we derive the rest.\"In order to reach the third point of reference one must perceive two places atonce.\"My recollecting had put me in a strange mood- it was as if I had lived theexperience just a few minutes earlier. I was suddenly aware of something I hadcompletely missed before. Under don Juan's supervision, I had twice beforeexperienced that divided perception, but this was the first time I hadaccomplished it all by myself.Thinking about my recollection, I also realized that my sensory experience wasmore complex than I had at first thought. During the time I had loomed over thebushes, I had been aware- without words or even thoughts- that being in twoplaces, or being 'here and here' as don Juan had called it, rendered myperception immediate and complete at both places. But I had also been aware thatmy double perception lacked the total clarity of normal perception.Don Juan explained that normal perception had an axis. 'Here and there' were theperimeters of that axis, and we were partial to the clarity of 'here'. He saidthat in normal perception, only 'here' was perceived completely,instantaneously, and directly. Its twin referent, 'there', lacked immediacy. Itwas inferred, deduced, expected, even assumed, but it was not apprehendeddirectly with all the senses.When we perceived two places at once, total clarity was lost, but the immediateperception of 'there' was gained.\"But then, don Juan, I was right in describing my perception as the importantpart of my experience,\" I said.\"No, you were not,\" he said. \"What you experienced was vital to you because itopened the road to silent knowledge, but the important thing was the jaguar.That jaguar was indeed a manifestation of the spirit.\"That big cat came unnoticed out of nowhere. And he could have finished us offas surely as I am talking to you. That jaguar was an expression of magic.Without him you would have had no elation, no lesson, no realizations.\"\"But was he a real jaguar?\" I asked.\"You bet he was real!\"Don Juan observed that for an average man that big cat would have been afrightening oddity. An average man would have been hard put to explain inreasonable terms what that jaguar was doing in Chihuahua so far from a tropicaljungle. But a sorcerer, because he had a connecting link with intent, saw thatjaguar as a vehicle to perceiving- not an oddity, but a source of awe.There were a lot of questions I wanted to ask, and yet I knew the answers beforeI could articulate the questions. I followed the course of my own questions andanswers for a while, until finally I realized it did not matter that I silentlyknew the answers; answers had to be verbalized to be of any value.I voiced the first question that came to mind. I asked don Juan to explain whatseemed to be a contradiction. He had asserted that only the spirit could movethe assemblage point. But then he had said that my feelings, processed intointent, had moved my assemblage point.\"Only sorcerers can turn their feelings into intent,\" he said. \"Intent is thespirit, so it is the spirit which moves their assemblage points.\"The misleading part of all this,\" he went on, \"is that I am saying onlysorcerers know about the spirit and that intent is the exclusive domain ofsorcerers. This is not true at all, but it is the situation in the realm ofpracticality.\"The real condition is that sorcerers are more aware of their connection withthe spirit than the average man and strive to manipulate it. That's all.\"I've already told you, the connecting link with intent is the universal featureshared by everything there is.\"Two or three times, don Juan seemed about to start to add something. Hevacillated, apparently trying to choose his words. Finally he said that being intwo places at once was a milestone [* milestone- a significant event in oneslife ] sorcerers used to mark the moment the assemblage point reached the placeof silent knowledge. Split perception, if accomplished by one's own means, wascalled the free movement of the assemblage point.He assured me that every nagual consistently did everything within his power toencourage the free movement of his apprentices' assemblage points. This all-outeffort was cryptically called 'reaching out for the third point'.\"The most difficult aspect of the nagual's knowledge,\" don Juan went on, \"andcertainly the most crucial part of his task is that of reaching out for thethird point- the nagual intends that free movement, and the spirit channels tothe nagual the means to accomplish it. I had never intended anything of thatsort until you came along. Therefore, I had never fully appreciated mybenefactor's gigantic effort to intend it for me.\"Difficult as it is for a nagual to intend that free movement for hisdisciples,\" don Juan went on, \"it's nothing compared with the difficulty hisdisciples have in understanding what the nagual is doing. Look at the way youyourself struggle! The same thing happened to me. Most of the time, I ended upbelieving the trickery of the spirit was simply the trickery of the nagualJulian.\"Later on, I realized I owed him my life and well-being,\" don Juan continued.\"Now I know I owe him infinitely more. Since I can't begin to describe what Ireally owe him, I prefer to say he cajoled me into having a third point ofreference.\"The third point of reference is freedom of perception; it is intent; it is thespirit; the somersault of thought into the miraculous; the act of reachingbeyond our boundaries and touching the inconceivable.\" ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"The Two One-Way BridgesDon Juan and I were sitting at the table in his kitchen. It was early morning.We had just returned from the mountains where we had spent the night after I hadrecalled my experience with the jaguar. Recollecting my split perception had putme in a state of euphoria which don Juan had employed, as usual, to plunge meinto more sensory experiences that I was now unable to recall. My euphoria,however, had not waned.\"To discover the possibility of being in two places at once is very exciting tothe mind,\" he said. \"Since our minds are our rationality, and our rationality isour self-reflection, anything beyond our self-reflection either appalls us orattracts us, depending on what kind of persons we are.\"He looked at me fixedly and then smiled as if he had just found out somethingnew.\"Or it appalls and attracts us in the same measure,\" he said, \"which seems to bethe case with both of us.\"I told him that with me it was not a matter of being appalled or attracted by myexperience, but a matter of being frightened by the immensity of the possibilityof split perception.\"I can't say that I don't believe I was in two places at once,\" I said. \"I can'tdeny my experience, and yet I think I am so frightened by it that my mindrefuses to accept it as a fact.\"\"You and I are the type of people who become obsessed by things like that, andthen forget all about them,\" he remarked and laughed. \"You and I are very muchalike.\"It was my turn to laugh. I knew he was making fun of me. Yet he projected suchsincerity that I wanted to believe he was being truthful.I told him that among his apprentices, I was the only one who had learned not totake his statements of equality with us too seriously. I said that I had seenhim in action, hearing him tell each of his apprentices, in the most sinceretone, \"You and I are such fools. We are so alike!\" And I had been horrified,time and time again, to realize that they believed him.\"You are not like any one of us, don Juan,\" I said. \"You are a mirror thatdoesn't reflect our images. You are already beyond our reach.\"\"What you're witnessing is the result of a lifelong struggle,\" he said. \"Whatyou see is a sorcerer who has finally learned to follow the designs of thespirit, but that's all.\"I have described to you, in many ways, the different stages a warrior passesthrough along the path of knowledge,\" he went on. \"In terms of his connectionwith intent, a warrior goes through four stages. The first is when he has arusty, untrustworthy link with intent. The second is when he succeeds incleaning it. The third is when he learns to manipulate it. And the fourth iswhen he learns to accept the designs of the abstract.\"Don Juan maintained that his attainment did not make him intrinsicallydifferent. It only made him more resourceful; thus he was not being facetiouswhen he said to me or to his other apprentices that he was just like us.\"I understand exactly what you are going through,\" he continued. \"When I laughat you, I really laugh at the memory of myself in your shoes. I, too, held on tothe world of everyday life. I held on to it by my fingernails. Everything toldme to let go, but I couldn't. Just like you, I trusted my mind implicitly, and Ihad no reason to do so. I was no longer an average man.\"My problem then is your problem today. The momentum of the daily world carriedme, and I kept acting like an average man. I held on desperately to my flimsyrational Structures. Don't you do the same.\"\"I don't hold onto any structures; they hold onto me,\" I said, and that made himlaugh.I told him I understood him to perfection, but that no matter how hard I tried,I was unable to carry on as a sorcerer should.He said my disadvantage in the sorcerers' world was my lack of familiarity withit. In that world I had to relate myself to everything in a new way; which wasinfinitely more difficult, because it had very little to do with my everydaylife continuity.He described the specific problem of sorcerers as twofold.One is the impossibility of restoring a shattered continuity.The other is the impossibility of using the continuity dictated by the newposition of their assemblage points. That new continuity is always too tenuous,too unstable, and does not offer sorcerers the assuredness they need to functionas if they were in the world of everyday life.\"How do sorcerers resolve this problem?\" I asked.\"None of us resolves anything,\" he replied. \"The spirit either resolves it forus or it doesn't. If it does, a sorcerer finds himself acting in the sorcerers'world, but without knowing how. This is the reason why I have insisted from theday I found you that impeccability is all that counts. A sorcerer lives animpeccable life, and that seems to beckon the solution. Why? No one knows.\"Don Juan remained quiet for a moment. And then, as if I had voiced it, hecommented on a thought I was having. I was thinking that impeccability alwaysmade me think of religious morality.\"Impeccability, as I have told you so many times, is not morality,\" he said. \"Itonly resembles morality. Impeccability is simply the best use of our energylevel. Naturally, it calls for frugality, thoughtfulness, simplicity, innocence;and above all, it calls for lack of self-reflection. All this makes it soundlike a manual for monastic life, but it isn't.\"Sorcerers say that in order to command the spirit, and by that they mean tocommand the movement of the assemblage point, one needs energy. The only thingthat stores energy for us is our impeccability.\"Don Juan remarked that we do not have to be students of sorcery to move ourassemblage point. Sometimes, due to natural although dramatic circumstances-such as war, deprivation, stress, fatigue, sorrow, or helplessness- men'sassemblage points undergo profound movements. If the men who found themselves insuch circumstances were able to adopt a sorcerer's ideology, don Juan said, theywould be able to maximize that natural movement with no trouble. And they wouldseek and find extraordinary things instead of doing what men do in suchcircumstances: craving the return to normalcy.\"When a movement of the assemblage point is maximized,\" he went on, \"both theaverage man or the apprentice in sorcery becomes a sorcerer, because bymaximizing that movement, continuity is shattered beyond repair.\"\"How do you maximize that movement?\" I asked.\"By curtailing self-reflection,\" he replied. \"Moving the assemblage point orbreaking one's continuity is not the real difficulty. The real difficulty ishaving energy. If one has energy, once the assemblage point moves, inconceivablethings are there for the asking.\"Don Juan explained that man's predicament is that he intuits his hiddenresources, but he does not dare use them. This is why sorcerers say that man'splight [* plight- a situation, especially an unpleasant or trying one, fromwhich untangling is difficult ] is the counterpoint between his stupidity andhis ignorance.He said that man needs now, more so than ever, to be taught new ideas that haveto do exclusively with his inner world- sorcerers' ideas, not social ideas,ideas pertaining to man facing the unknown, facing his personal death. Now, morethan anything else, he needs to be taught the secrets of the assemblage point.With no preliminaries, and without stopping to think, don Juan then began totell me a sorcery story. He said that for an entire year he had been the only young person in the nagualJulian's house. Don Juan was so completely self-centered he had not even noticedwhen at the beginning of the second year his benefactor brought three young menand four young women to live in the house. As far as don Juan was concerned,those seven persons who arrived one at a time over two or three months weresimply servants and of no importance. One of the young men was even made hisassistant.Don Juan was convinced the nagual Julian had lured and cajoled them into comingto work for him without wages. And don Juan would have felt sorry for them hadit not been for their blind trust in the nagual Julian and their sickeningattachment to everyone and everything in the household.Don Juan's feeling was that they were born slaves and that he had nothing to sayto them. Yet he was obliged to make friends with them and give them advice, notbecause he wanted to, but because the nagual demanded it as part of his work. Asthey sought his counseling, he was horrified by the poignancy and drama of theirlife stories.He secretly congratulated himself for being better off than they. He sincerelyfelt he was smarter than all of them put together.He boasted to them that he could see through the nagual's maneuvers, althoughdon Juan could not claim to understand them. And he laughed at their ridiculousattempts to be helpful. He considered them servile and told them to their facesthat they were being mercilessly exploited by a professional tyrant.But what enraged don Juan was that the four young women had crushes on thenagual Julian and would do anything to please him. Don Juan sought solace in hiswork and plunged into it to forget his anger, or for hours on end he would readthe books that the nagual Julian had in the house. Reading became his passion.When he was reading, everyone knew not to bother him, except the nagual Julian,who took pleasure in never leaving him in peace. He was always after don Juan tobe friends with the young men and women. He told him repeatedly that all ofthem, don Juan included, were his sorcery apprentices. Don Juan was convincedthe nagual Julian knew nothing about sorcery, but he humored him, listening tohim without ever believing.The nagual Julian was unfazed by don Juan's lack of trust. He simply proceededas if don Juan believed him, and gathered all the apprentices together to givethem instruction. Periodically he took all of them on all-night excursions intothe local mountains. On most of these excursions the nagual would leave them bythemselves, stranded in those rugged mountains, with don Juan in charge.The rationale given for the trips was that in solitude, in the wilderness, theywould discover the spirit. But they never did. At least, not in any way don Juancould understand. However, the nagual Julian insisted so strongly on theimportance of knowing the spirit that don Juan became obsessed with knowing whatthe spirit was.During one of those nighttime excursions, the nagual Julian urged don Juan to goafter the spirit, even if he didn't understand it.\"Of course, he meant the only thing a nagual could mean: the movement of theassemblage point,\" don Juan said. \"But he worded it in a way he believed wouldmake sense to me: go after the spirit.\"I thought he was talking nonsense. At that time I had already formed my ownopinions and beliefs, and was convinced that the spirit was what is known ascharacter, volition, guts, strength. And I believed I didn't have to go afterthem. I had them all.\"The nagual Julian insisted that the spirit was indefinable, that one could noteven feel it, much less talk about it. One could only beckon it, he said, byacknowledging its existence. My retort was very much the same as yours: onecannot beckon something that does not exist.\"Don Juan told me he had argued so much with the nagual that the nagual finallypromised him, in front of his entire household, that in one single stroke he wasgoing to show him not only what the spirit was, but how to define it. He alsopromised to throw an enormous party, even inviting the neighbors, to celebratedon Juan's lesson.Don Juan remarked that in those days, before the Mexican Revolution, the nagualJulian and the seven women of his group passed themselves off as the wealthyowners of a large hacienda. Nobody ever doubted their image, especially thenagual Julian's, a rich and handsome landholder who had set aside his earnestdesire to pursue an ecclesiastical career in order to care for his sevenunmarried sisters.One day, during the rainy season, the nagual Julian announced that as soon asthe rains stopped, he would hold the enormous party he had promised don Juan.And one Sunday afternoon he took his entire household to the banks of the river,which was in flood because of the heavy rains. The nagual Julian rode his horsewhile don Juan trotted respectfully behind, as was their custom in case they metany of their neighbors; as far as the neighbors knew, don Juan was thelandlord's personal servant.The nagual chose for their picnic a site on high ground by the edge of theriver. The women had prepared food and drink. The nagual had even brought agroup of musicians from the town. It was a big party which included the peons ofthe hacienda, neighbors, and even passing strangers that had meandered over tojoin the fun.Everybody ate and drank to his heart's content. The nagual danced with all thewomen, sang, and recited poetry. He told jokes and, with the help of some of thewomen, staged skits to the delight of all.At a given moment, the nagual Julian asked if any of those present, especiallythe apprentices, wanted to share don Juan's lesson. They all declined. All ofthem were keenly aware of the nagual's hard tactics. Then he asked don Juan ifhe was sure he wanted to find out what the spirit was.Don Juan could not say no. He simply could not back out. He announced that hewas as ready as he could ever be. The nagual guided him to the edge of theraging river and made him kneel. The nagual began a long incantation in which heinvoked the power of the wind and the mountains and asked the power of the riverto advise don Juan.His incantation, meaningful as it might have been, was worded so irreverentlythat everyone had to laugh. When he finished, he asked don Juan to stand up withhis eyes closed. Then he took the apprentice in his arms, as he would a child,and threw him into the rushing waters, shouting, \"Don't hate the river, forheaven's sake!\"Relating this incident sent don Juan into fits of laughter. Perhaps under othercircumstances I, too, might have found it hilarious. This time, however, thestory upset me tremendously.\"You should have seen those people's faces,\" don Juan continued. \"I caught aglimpse of their dismay as I flew through the air on my way to the river. No onehad anticipated that that devilish nagual would do a thing like that.\"Don Juan said he had thought it was the end of his life. He was not a goodswimmer, and as he sank to the bottom of the river he cursed himself forallowing this to happen to him. He was so angry he did not have time to panic.All he could think about was his resolve that he was not going to die in thatfrigging river, at the hands of that frigging man.His feet touched bottom and he propelled himself up. It was not a deep river,but the flood waters had widened it a great deal. The current was swift, and itpulled him along as he dog-paddled, trying not to let the rushing waters tumblehim around.The current dragged him a long distance. And while he was being dragged andtrying his best not to succumb, he entered into a strange frame of mind. He knewhis flaw. He was a very angry man and his pent-up anger made him hate and fightwith everyone around. But he could not hate or fight the river, or be impatientwith it, or fret, which were the ways he normally behaved with everything andeverybody in his life. All he could do with the river was follow its flow.Don Juan contended that that simple realization and the acquiescence itengendered tipped the scales, so to speak, and he experienced a free movement ofhis assemblage point. Suddenly, without being in any way aware of what washappening, instead of being pulled by the rushing water, don Juan felt himselfrunning along the riverbank. He was running so fast that he had no time tothink. A tremendous force was pulling him, making him race over boulders andfallen trees, as if they were not there.After he had run in that desperate fashion for quite a while, don Juan braved aquick look at the reddish, rushing water. And he saw himself being roughlytumbled by the current. Nothing in his experience had prepared him for such amoment. He knew then, without involving his thought processes, that he was intwo places at once. And in one of them, in the rushing river, he was helpless.All his energy went into trying to save himself.Without thinking about it, he began angling away from the riverbank. It took allhis strength and determination to edge an inch at a time. He felt as if he weredragging a tree. He moved so slowly that it took him an eternity to gain a fewyards.The strain was too much for him. Suddenly he was no longer running; he wasfalling down a deep well. When he hit the water, the coldness of it made himscream. And then he was back in the river, being dragged by the current. Hisfright upon finding himself back in the rushing water was so intense that all hecould do was to wish with all his might to be safe and sound on the riverbank.And immediately he was there again, running at breakneck speed parallel to, buta distance from, the river.As he ran, he looked at the rushing water and saw himself struggling to stayafloat. He wanted to yell a command; he wanted to order himself to swim at anangle, but he had no voice. His anguish for the part of him that was in thewater was overwhelming. It served as a bridge between the two Juan Matuses. Hewas instantly back in the water, swimming at an angle toward the bank.The incredible sensation of alternating between two places was enough toeradicate his fear. He no longer cared about his fate. He alternated freelybetween swimming in the river and racing on the bank. But whichever he wasdoing, he consistently moved toward his left, racing away from the river orpaddling to the left shore.He came out on the left side of the river about five miles downstream. He had towait there, sheltering in the shrubs, for over a week. He was waiting for thewaters to subside so he could wade across, but he was also waiting until hisfright wore off and he was whole again.Don Juan said that what had happened was that the strong, sustained emotion offighting for his life had caused his assemblage point to move squarely to theplace of silent knowledge. Because he had never paid any attention to what thenagual Julian told him about the assemblage point, he had no idea what washappening to him. He was frightened at the thought that he might never be normalagain.But as he explored his split perception, he discovered its practical side andfound he liked it. He was double for days. He could be thoroughly one or theother. Or he could be both at the same time. When he was both, things becamefuzzy and neither being was effective, so he abandoned that alternative. Butbeing one or the other opened up inconceivable possibilities for him.While he recuperated in the bushes, he established that one of his beings wasmore flexible than the other and could cover distances in the blink of an eyeand find food or the best place to hide. It was this being that once went to thenagual's house to see if they were worrying about him.He heard the young people crying for him, and that was certainly a surprise. Hewould have gone on watching them indefinitely, since he adored the idea offinding out what they thought of him, but the nagual Julian caught him and putan end to it.That was the only time he had been truly afraid of the nagual. Don Juan heardthe nagual telling him to stop his nonsense. He appeared suddenly, a jet black,bell-shaped object of immense weight and strength. He grabbed don Juan. Don Juandid not know how the nagual was grabbing him, but it hurt in a most unsettlingway. It was a sharp nervous pain he felt in his stomach and groin.\"I was instantly back on the riverbank,\" don Juan said, laughing. \"I got up,waded the recently subsided river, and started to walk home.\" Don Juan paused, then asked me what I thought of his story. And I told him thatit had appalled me.\"You could have drowned in that river,\" I said, almost shouting. \"What a brutalthing to do to you. The nagual Julian must have been crazy!\"\"Wait a minute,\" don Juan protested. \"The nagual Julian was devilish, but notcrazy. He did what he had to do in his role as nagual and teacher. It's truethat I could have died. But that's a risk we all have to take. You yourselfcould have been easily eaten by the jaguar, or could have died from any of thethings I have made you do. The nagual Julian was bold and commanding and tackledeverything directly. No beating around the bush with him, no mincing words.\"I insisted that valuable as the lesson might have been, it still appeared to methat the nagual Julian's methods were bizarre and excessive. I admitted to donJuan that everything I had heard about the nagual Julian had bothered me I somuch I had formed a most negative picture of him.\"I think you're afraid that one of these days I'm going to throw you into theriver or make you wear women's clothes,\" he said and began to laugh. \"That's whyyou don't approve of the nagual Julian.\"I admitted that he was right, and he assured me that he had no intentions ofimitating his benefactor's methods, because they did not work for him. He was,he said, as ruthless but not as practical as the nagual Julian.\"At that time,\" don Juan continued, \"I didn't appreciate his art, and Icertainly didn't like what he did to me, but now, whenever I think about it, Iadmire him all the more for his superb and direct way of placing me in theposition of silent knowledge.\" Don Juan said that because of the enormity of his experience, he had totallyforgotten the monstrous man. He walked unescorted almost to the door of thenagual Julian's house, then changed his mind and went instead to the nagualElias's place, seeking solace. And the nagual Elias explained to him the deepconsistency of the nagual Julian's actions.The nagual Elias could hardly contain his excitement when he heard don Juan'sstory. In a fervent tone he explained to don Juan that his benefactor the nagualJulian was a supreme stalker; always after practicalities. His endless quest wasfor pragmatic views and solutions. His behavior that day at the river had been amasterpiece of stalking. He had manipulated and affected everyone. Even theriver seemed to be at his command.The nagual Elias maintained that while don Juan was being carried by thecurrent, fighting for his life, the river helped him understand what the spiritwas. And thanks to that understanding, don Juan had the opportunity to enterdirectly into silent knowledge.Don Juan said that because he was a callow [* callow- young and inexperienced]youth he listened to the nagual Elias without understanding a word, but wasmoved with sincere admiration for the nagual's intensity.First, the nagual Elias explained to don Juan that sound and the meaning ofwords were of supreme importance to stalkers. Words were used by them as keys toopen anything that was closed. Stalkers, therefore, had to state their aimbefore attempting to achieve it. But they could not reveal their true aim at theoutset, so they had to word things carefully to conceal the main thrust.The nagual Elias called this act waking up intent. He explained to don Juan thatthe nagual Julian woke up intent by affirming emphatically in front of hisentire household that he was going to show don Juan, in one stroke, what thespirit was and how to define it. This was completely nonsensical because thenagual Julian knew there was no way to define the spirit. What he was reallytrying to do was, of course, to place don Juan in the position of silentknowledge.After making the statement which concealed his true aim, the nagual Juliangathered as many people as he could, thus making them both his witting andunwitting accomplices. All of them knew about his stated goal, but not a singleone knew what he really had in mind.The old nagual Elias's belief that his explanation would shake don Juan out ofhis impossible stand of total rebelliousness and indifference was completelywrong. Yet the nagual patiently continued to explain to him that while he hadbeen fighting the current in the river he had reached the third point.The old nagual explained that the position of silent knowledge was called thethird point because in order to get to it one had to pass the second point; theplace of no pity.He said that don Juan's assemblage point had acquired sufficient fluidity forhim to be double, which had allowed him to be in both the place of reason and inthe place of silent knowledge, either alternately or at the same time.The nagual Elias told don Juan that his accomplishment was magnificent. He evenhugged don Juan as if he were a child. And he could not stop talking about howdon Juan, in spite of not knowing anything- or maybe because of not knowinganything- had transferred his total energy from one place to the other. Whichmeant to the nagual that don Juan's assemblage point had a most propitious,natural fluidity.He said to don Juan that every human being had a capacity for that fluidity. Formost of us, however, it was stored away and we never used it; except on rareoccasions which were brought about by sorcerers, such as the experience he hadjust had; or by dramatic natural circumstances, such as a life-or-deathstruggle.Don Juan listened, mesmerized by the sound of the old nagual's voice. When hepaid attention, he could follow anything the man said, which was something hehad never been able to do with the nagual Julian.The old nagual went on to explain that humanity was on the first point, reason,but that not every human being's assemblage point was squarely on the positionof reason. Those who were on the spot itself were the true leaders of mankind.Most of the time they were unknown people whose genius was the exercising oftheir reason.The nagual said there had been another time, when mankind had been on the 'thirdpoint', which, of course, had been the first point then. But after that, mankindmoved to the place of reason.When silent knowledge was the first point the same condition prevailed. Notevery human being's assemblage point was squarely on that position either. Thismeant that the true leaders of mankind had always been the few human beingswhose assemblage points happened to be either on the exact point of reason or ofsilent knowledge.The rest of humanity, the old nagual told don Juan, was merely the audience. Inour day, they were the lovers of reason. In the past, they had been the loversof silent knowledge. They were the ones who had admired and sung odes to theheroes of either position.The nagual stated that mankind had spent the longer part of its history in theposition of silent knowledge, and that this explained our great longing for it.Don Juan asked the old nagual what exactly the nagual Julian was doing to him.His question sounded more mature and intelligent than what he really meant. Thenagual Elias answered it in terms totally unintelligible to don Juan at thattime.He said that the nagual Julian was coaching don Juan; enticing his assemblagepoint to the position of reason so he could be a thinker rather than merely partof an unsophisticated but emotionally charged audience that loved the orderlyworks of reason.At the same time, the nagual was coaching don Juan to be a true abstractsorcerer instead of merely part of a morbid and ignorant audience of lovers ofthe unknown.The nagual Elias assured don Juan that only a human being who was a paragon ofreason could move his assemblage point easily and be a paragon of silentknowledge.He said that only those who were squarely in either position could see the otherposition clearly, and that that had been the way the age of reason came tobeing. The position of reason was clearly seen from the position of silentknowledge.The old nagual told don Juan that the one-way bridge from silent knowledge toreason was called 'concern'. That is, the concern that true men of silentknowledge had about the source of what they knew.And the other one-way bridge, from reason to silent knowledge, was called 'pureunderstanding'. That is, the recognition that told the man of reason that reasonwas only one island in an endless sea of islands.The nagual added that a human being who had both oneway bridges working was asorcerer in direct contact with the spirit- the vital force that made bothpositions possible. He pointed out to don Juan that everything the nagual Julianhad done that day at the river had been a show, not for a human audience, butfor the spirit- the force that was watching him. He pranced and frolicked withabandon and entertained everybody, especially the power he was addressing.Don Juan said that the nagual Elias assured him that the spirit only listenedwhen the speaker speaks in gestures. And gestures do not mean signs or bodymovements, but acts of true abandon, acts of largesse, or of humor. As a gesturefor the spirit, sorcerers bring out the best of themselves and silently offer itto the abstract. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"Intending AppearancesDon Juan wanted us to make one more trip to the mountains before I went home,but we never made it. Instead, he asked me to drive him to the city. He neededto see some people there.On the way he talked about every subject but intent. It was a welcome respite.In the afternoon, after he had taken care of his business, we sat on hisfavorite bench in the plaza. The place was deserted. I was very tired andsleepy. But then, quite unexpectedly, I perked up. My mind became crystal clear.Don Juan immediately noticed the change and laughed at my gesture of surprise.He picked a thought right out of my mind; or perhaps it was I who picked thatthought out of his.\"If you think about life in terms of hours instead of years, our lives areimmensely long,\" he said. \"Even if you think in terms of days, life is stillinterminable.\"That was exactly what I had been thinking.He told me that sorcerers counted their lives in hours, and that in one hour itwas possible for a sorcerer to live the equivalent in intensity of a normallife. This intensity is an advantage when it comes to storing information in themovement of the assemblage point.I demanded that he explain this to me in more detail. A long time before,because it was so cumbersome to take notes on conversations, he had recommendedthat I keep all the information I obtained about the sorcerers' world neatlyarranged, not on paper nor in my mind, but in the movement of my assemblagepoint.\"The assemblage point,\" don Juan said, \"with even the most minute shifting,creates totally isolated islands of perception. Information in the form ofexperiences in the complexity of awareness can be stored there.\"I asked, \"But how can information be stored in something so vague?\"\"The mind is equally vague, and still you trust it because you are familiar withit,\" he retorted. \"You don't yet have the same familiarity with the movement ofthe assemblage point, but it is just about the same.\"\"What I mean is, how is information stored?\" I insisted.\"The information is stored in the experience itself,\" he explained. \"Later, whena sorcerer moves his assemblage point to the exact spot where it had been, herelives the total experience. This sorcerers' recollection is the way to getback all the information stored in the movement of die assemblage point.\"Intensity is an automatic result of the movement of the assemblage point,\" hecontinued. \"For instance, you are living these moments more intensely than youordinarily would, so, properly speaking, you are storing intensity. Some dayyou'll relive this moment by making your assemblage point return to the precisespot where it is now. That is the way sorcerers store information.\"I told don Juan that the intense recollections I had had in the past few dayshad just happened to me without any special mental process I was aware of.\"How can one deliberately manage to recollect?\" I asked.\"Intensity, being an aspect of intent, is connected naturally to the shine ofthe sorcerers' eyes,\" he explained. \"In order to recall those isolated islandsof perception, sorcerers need only intend the particular shine of their eyesassociated with whichever spot they want to return to. But I have alreadyexplained that.\"I must have looked perplexed. Don Juan regarded me with a serious expression. Iopened my mouth two or three times to ask him questions, but I could notformulate my thoughts.\"Because his intensity rate is greater than normal,\" don Juan said, \"in a fewhours a sorcerer can live the equivalent of a normal lifetime. His assemblagepoint, by shifting to an unfamiliar position, takes in more energy than usual.That extra flow of energy is called intensity.\"I understood what he was saying with perfect clarity, and my rationalitystaggered under the impact of the tremendous implication.Don Juan fixed me with his stare and then warned me to beware of a reactionwhich typically afflicted sorcerers- a frustrating desire to explain the sorceryexperience in cogent, well reasoned terms.\"The sorcerers' experience is so outlandish,\" don Juan went on, \"that sorcerersconsider it an intellectual exercise, and use it to stalk themselves with. Theirtrump card as stalkers, though, is that they remain keenly aware that we areperceivers and that perception has more possibilities than the mind canconceive.\"As my only comment, I voiced my apprehension about the outlandish possibilitiesof human awareness.\"In order to protect themselves from that immensity,\" don Juan said, \"sorcererslearn to maintain a perfect blend of ruthlessness, cunning, patience, andsweetness. These four bases are inextricably [* inextricably- in a manner notcapable of being untangled] bound together. Sorcerers cultivate these bases byintending them. They are, naturally, positions of the assemblage point.\"He went on to say that every act performed by any sorcerer was by definitiongoverned by these four principles. So, properly speaking, every sorcerer's everyaction is deliberate in thought and realization, and has the specific blend ofthe four foundations of stalking.\"Sorcerers use the four moods of stalking as guides,\" he continued. \"These arefour different frames of mind; four different brands of intensity that sorcererscan use to induce their assemblage points to move to specific positions.\"He seemed suddenly annoyed. I asked if it was my insistence on speculating thatwas bothering him.\"I am just considering how our rationality puts us between a rock and a hardplace,\" he said. \"Our tendency is to ponder, to question, to find out. And thereis no way to do that from within the discipline of sorcery. Sorcery is the actof reaching the place of silent knowledge, and silent knowledge can't bereasoned out. It can only be experienced.\"He smiled, his eyes shining like two spots of light. He said that sorcerers, inan effort to protect themselves from the overwhelming effect of silentknowledge, developed the art of stalking. Stalking moves the assemblage pointminutely but steadily, thus giving sorcerers time and therefore the possibilityof buttressing themselves.\"Within the art of stalking,\" don Juan continued, \"there is a technique whichsorcerers use a great deal: controlled folly. Sorcerers claim that controlledfolly is the only way they have of dealing with themselves- in their state ofexpanded awareness and perception- and with everybody and everything in theworld of daily affairs.\"Don Juan had explained controlled folly as the art of controlled deception orthe art of pretending to be thoroughly immersed in the action at hand-pretending so well no one could tell it from the real thing. Controlled folly isnot an outright deception, he had told me, but a sophisticated, artistic way ofbeing separated from everything while remaining an integral part of everything.\"Controlled folly is an art,\" don Juan continued. \"A very bothersome art, and adifficult one to learn. Many sorcerers don't have the stomach for it, notbecause there is anything inherently wrong with the art, but because it takes alot of energy to exercise it.\"Don Juan admitted that he practiced it conscientiously, although he was notparticularly fond of doing so; perhaps because his benefactor had been so adeptat it. Or, perhaps it was because his personality- which he said was basicallydevious and petty- simply did not have the agility needed to practice controlledfolly.I looked at him with surprise. He stopped talking and fixed me with hismischievous eyes.\"By the time we come to sorcery, our personality is already formed,\" he said,and shrugged his shoulders to signify resignation, \"and all we can do ispractice controlled folly and laugh at ourselves.\"I had a surge of empathy and assured him that to me he was not in any way pettyor devious.\"But that's my basic personality,\" he insisted.And I insisted that it was not.\"Stalkers who practice controlled folly believe that, in matters of personality,the entire human race falls into three categories,\" he said, and smiled the wayhe always did when he was setting me up.\"That's absurd,\" I protested. \"Human behavior is too complex to be categorizedso simply.\"\"Stalkers say that we are not so complex as we think we are,\" he said, \"and thatwe all belong to one of three categories.\"I laughed out of nervousness. Ordinarily I would have taken such a statement asa joke, but this time, because my mind was extremely clear and my thoughts werepoignant, I felt he was indeed serious.\"Are you serious?\" I asked, as politely as I could.\"Completely serious,\" he replied, and began to laugh.His laughter relaxed me a little. And he continued explaining the stalkers'system of classification.He said that people in the first class are the perfect secretaries, assistants,companions. They have a very fluid personality, but their fluidity is notnourishing. They are, however, serviceable, concerned, totally domestic,resourceful within limits, humorous, well-mannered, sweet, delicate. In otherwords, they are the nicest people one could find, but they have one huge flaw:they can't function alone. They are always in need of someone to direct them.With direction, no matter how strained or antagonistic that direction might be,they are stupendous. By themselves, they perish.People in the second class are not nice at all. They are petty, vindictive,envious, jealous, self-centered. They talk exclusively about themselves andusually demand that people conform to their standards. They always take theinitiative even though they are not comfortable with it. They are thoroughly illat ease in every situation and never relax. They are insecure and are neverpleased. The more insecure they become, the nastier they are. Their fatal flawis that they would kill to be leaders.In the third category are people who are neither nice nor nasty. They serve noone, nor do they impose themselves on anyone. Rather they are indifferent. Theyhave an exalted idea about themselves derived solely from daydreams and wishfulthinking. If they are extraordinary at anything, it is at waiting for things tohappen. They are waiting to be discovered and conquered and have a marvelousfacility for creating the illusion that they have great things in abeyance,which they always promise to deliver but never do because, in fact, they do nothave such resources.Don Juan said that he himself definitely belonged to the second class. He thenasked me to classify myself and I became rattled. Don Juan was practically onthe ground, bent over with laughter.He urged me again to classify myself, and reluctantly I suggested I might be acombination of the three.\"Don't give me that combination nonsense,\" he said, still laughing. \"We aresimple beings, each of us is one of the three types. And as far as I amconcerned, you belong to the second class. Stalkers call them farts.\"I began to protest that his scheme of classification was demeaning. But Istopped myself just as I was about to go into a long tirade. [* tirade- a speechof violent accusation or condemnation] Instead I commented that if it were truethat there are only three types of personalities, all of us are trapped in oneof those three categories for life with no hope of change or redemption.He agreed that that was exactly the case. Except that one avenue for redemptionremained. Sorcerers had long ago learned that only our personal self-reflectionfell into one of the categories.\"The trouble with us is that we take ourselves seriously,\" he said. \"Whichevercategory our self-image falls into only matters because of our self-importance.If we weren't self-important, it wouldn't matter at all which category we fellinto.\"I'll always be a fart,\" he continued, his body shaking with laughter. \"And sowill you. But now I am a fart who doesn't take himself seriously, while youstill do.\"I was indignant. I wanted to argue with him, but could not muster the energy forit.In the empty plaza, the reverberation of his laughter was eerie.He changed the subject then, and reeled off the basic cores he had discussedwith me: the manifestations of the spirit, the knock of the spirit, the trickeryof the spirit, the descent of the spirit, the requirement of intent, andhandling intent. He repeated them as if he were giving my memory a chance toretain them fully. And then, he succinctly highlighted everything he had told meabout them. It was as if he were deliberately making me store all thatinformation in the intensity of that moment.I remarked that the basic cores were still a mystery to me. I felt veryapprehensive about my ability to understand them. He was giving me theimpression that he was about to dismiss the topic, and I had not grasped itsmeaning at all.I insisted that I had to ask him more questions about the abstract cores.He seemed to assess what I was saying, then he quietly nodded his head.\"This topic was also very difficult for me,\" he said. \"And I, too, asked manyquestions. I was perhaps a tinge more self-centered than you. And very nasty.Nagging was the only way I knew of asking questions. You yourself are rather abelligerent inquisitor. At the end, of course, you and I are equally annoying,but for different reasons.\"There was only one more thing don Juan added to our discussion of the basiccores before he changed the subject; that they revealed themselves extremelyslowly, erratically advancing and retreating.\"I can't repeat often enough that every man whose assemblage point moves canmove it further,\" he began. \"And the only reason we need a teacher is to spur uson mercilessly. Otherwise our natural reaction is to stop to congratulateourselves for having covered so much ground.\"He said that we were both good examples of our odious [* odious- singularlyoffensive] tendency to go easy on ourselves. His benefactor, fortunately, beingthe stupendous stalker he was, had not spared him.Don Juan said that in the course of their nighttime journeys in the wilderness,the nagual Julian had lectured him extensively on the nature of self-importanceand the movement of the assemblage point.For the nagual Julian, self-importance was a monster that had three thousandheads. And one could face up to it and destroy it in any of three ways. Thefirst way was to sever each head one at a time; the second was to reach thatmysterious state of being called the place of no pity, which destroyedself-importance by slowly starving it; and the third was to pay for theinstantaneous annihilation of the three-thousand headed monster with one'ssymbolic death.The nagual Julian recommended the third alternative. But he told don Juan thathe could consider himself fortunate if he got the chance to choose; because itwas the spirit that usually determined which way the sorcerer was to go, and itwas the duty of the sorcerer to follow.Don Juan said that he had guided me as his benefactor had guided him; to cut offthe three thousand heads of self-importance, one by one, but that the resultshad been quite different. While I had responded very well, he had not respondedat all.\"Mine was a peculiar condition,\" he went on. \"From the moment my benefactor sawme lying on the road with a bullet hole in my chest, he knew I was the newnagual. He acted accordingly and moved my assemblage point as soon as my healthpermitted it. And I saw with great ease a field of energy in the form of thatmonstrous man. But this accomplishment, instead of helping as it was supposedto, hindered any further movement of my assemblage point. And while theassemblage points of the other apprentices moved steadily, mine remained fixedat the level of being able to see the monster.\"\"But didn't your benefactor tell you what was going on?\" I asked, truly baffledby the unnecessary complication.\"My benefactor didn't believe in handing down knowledge,\" don Juan said. \"Hethought that knowledge imparted that way lacked effectiveness. It was neverthere when one needed it. On the other hand, if knowledge was only insinuated,the person who was interested would devise ways to claim that knowledge.\"Don Juan said that the difference between his method of teaching and hisbenefactor's was that he himself believed one should have the freedom to choose.His benefactor did not.\"Didn't your benefactor's teacher, the nagual Elias, tell you what washappening?\" I insisted.\"He tried,\" don Juan said, and sighed, \"but I was truly impossible. I kneweverything. I just let the two men talk my ear off and never listened to a thingthey were saying.\"In order to deal with that impasse, the nagual Julian decided to force don Juanto accomplish once again, but in a different way, a free movement of hisassemblage point.I interrupted him to ask whether this had happened before or after hisexperience at the river. Don Juan's stories did not have the chronological orderI would have liked.\"This happened several months afterward,\" he replied. \"And don't you think foran instant that because I experienced that split perception I was reallychanged; or that I was wiser or more sober. Nothing of the sort.\"Consider what happens to you,\" he went on. \"I have not only broken yourcontinuity time and time again, I have ripped it to shreds; and look at you. Youstill act as if you were intact. That is a supreme accomplishment of magic; ofintending.\"I was the same. For a while, I would reel under the impact of what I wasexperiencing and then I would forget and tie up the severed ends as if nothinghad happened. That was why my benefactor believed that we can only really changeif we die.\" Returning to his story, don Juan said that the nagual used Tulio, the unsociablemember of his household, to deliver a new shattering blow to his psychologicalcontinuity.Don Juan said that all the apprentices, including himself, had never been intotal agreement about anything except that Tulio was a contemptibly arrogantlittle man. They hated Tulio because he either avoided them or snubbed them. Hetreated them all with such disdain that they felt like dirt. They were allconvinced that Tulio never spoke to them because he had nothing to say; and thathis most salient [* salient- having a quality that thrusts itself intoattention] feature, his arrogant aloofness, was a cover for his timidity.Yet in spite of his unpleasant personality, to the chagrin of all theapprentices, Tulio had undue influence on the household- especially on thenagual Julian, who seemed to dote [* dote- shower with love; show excessiveaffection for] on him.One morning the nagual Julian sent all the apprentices on a day long errand tothe city. The only person left in the house, besides the older members of thehousehold, was don Juan.Around midday the nagual Julian headed for his study to do his dailybookkeeping. As he was going in, he casually asked don Juan to help him with theaccounts.Don Juan began to look through the receipts and soon realized that to continuehe needed some information that Tulio, the overseer of the property, had; andhad forgotten to note down.The nagual Julian was definitely angry at Tulio's oversight, which pleased donJuan. The nagual impatiently ordered don Juan to find Tulio, who was out in thefields supervising the workers, and ask him to come to the study.Don Juan, gloating at the idea of annoying Tulio, ran half a mile to the fields,accompanied, of course, by a field hand to protect him from the monstrous man.He found Tulio supervising the workers from a distance, as always. Don Juan hadnoticed that Tulio hated to come into direct contact with people and alwayswatched them from afar.In a harsh voice and with an exaggeratedly imperious [* imperious- able to dealauthoritatively with affairs] manner, don Juan demanded that Tulio accompany himto the house because the nagual required his services. Tulio, his voice barelyaudible, replied that he was too busy at the moment, but that in about an hourhe would be free to come.Don Juan insisted, knowing that Tulio would not bother to argue with him andwould simply dismiss him with a turn of his head. He was shocked when Tuliobegan to yell obscenities at him. The scene was so out of character for Tuliothat even the farm workers stopped their labor, and looked at one anotherquestioningly. Don Juan was sure they had never heard Tulio raise his voice,much less yell improprieties.Don juan's own surprise was so great that he laughed nervously, which made Tulioextremely angry. He even hurled a rock at the frightened don Juan, who fled.Don Juan and his bodyguard immediately ran back to the house. At the front doorthey found Tulio. He was quietly talking and laughing with some of the women. Aswas his custom, he turned his head away, ignoring don Juan. Don Juan beganangrily to chastise him for socializing there when the nagual wanted him in hisstudy. Tulio and the women looked at don Juan as if he had gone mad.But Tulio was not his usual self that day. Instantly he yelled at don Juan toshut his damned mouth and mind his own damned business. He blatantly accused donJuan of trying to put him in a bad light with the nagual Julian.The women showed their dismay by gasping loudly and looking disapprovingly atdon Juan. They tried to calm Tulio. Don Juan ordered Tulio to go to the nagual'sstudy and explain the accounts. Tulio told him to go to hell.Don Juan was shaking with anger. The simple task of asking for the accounts hadturned into a nightmare. He controlled his temper. The women were watching himintently, which angered him all over again. In a silent rage he ran to thenagual's study. Tulio and the women went back to talking and laughing quietly asthough they were celebrating a private joke.Don Juan's surprise was total when he entered the study and found Tulio sittingat the nagual's desk absorbed in his bookkeeping. Don Juan made a supreme effortand controlled his anger. He smiled at Tulio. He no longer had the need toconfront Tulio. He had suddenly understood that the nagual Julian was usingTulio to test him, to see if he would lose his temper. He would not give himthat satisfaction.Without looking up from his accounts, Tulio said that if don Juan was lookingfor the nagual, he would probably find him at the other end of the house.Don Juan raced to the other end of the house to find the nagual Julian walkingslowly around the patio with Tulio at his side. The nagual appeared to beengrossed in his conversation with Tulio. Tulio gently nudged the nagual'ssleeve and said in a low voice that his assistant was there.The nagual matter-of-factly explained to don Juan everything about the accountthey had been working on. It was a long, detailed, and thorough explanation. Hesaid then that all don Juan had to do was to bring the account book from thestudy so that they could make the entry and have Tulio sign it.Don Juan could not understand what was happening. The detailed explanation andthe nagual's matter-of-fact tone had brought everything into the realm ofmundane affairs. Tulio impatiently ordered don Juan to hurry up and fetch thebook, because he was busy. He was needed somewhere else.By now don Juan had resigned himself to being a clown. He knew that the nagualwas up to something. The nagual Julian had that strange look in his eyes whichdon Juan always associated with his beastly jokes. Besides, Tulio had talkedmore that day than he had in the entire two years don Juan had been in thehouse.Without uttering a word, don Juan went back to the study. And as he hadexpected, Tulio had gotten there first. He was sitting on the corner of thedesk, waiting for don Juan, impatiently tapping the floor with the hard heel ofhis boot. He held out the ledger don Juan was after, gave it to him, and toldhim to be on his way.Despite being prepared, don Juan was astonished. He stared at the man, whobecame angry and abusive. Don Juan had to struggle not to explode. He keptsaying to himself that all this was merely a test of his attitude. He hadvisions of being thrown out of the house if he failed the test.In the midst of his turmoil, he was still able to wonder about the speed withwhich Tulio managed always to be one jump ahead of him.Don Juan certainly anticipated that Tulio would be waiting with the nagual.Still, when he saw him there, although he was not surprised, he was incredulous.He had raced through the house, following the shortest route. There was no waythat Tulio could run faster than he. Furthermore, if Tulio had run, he wouldhave had to run right alongside don Juan.The nagual Julian took the account book from don Juan with an air ofindifference. He made the entry and Tulio signed it. Then they continued talkingabout the account, disregarding don Juan, whose eyes were fixed on Tulio. DonJuan wanted to figure out what kind of test they were putting him through. Ithad to be a test of his attitude, he thought. After all, in that house, hisattitude had always been the issue.The nagual dismissed don Juan, saying he wanted to be alone with Tulio todiscuss business. Don Juan immediately went looking for the women to find outwhat they would say about this strange situation. He had only gone ten feet whenhe encountered two of the women and Tulio. The three of them were caught up in amost animated conversation. He saw them before they had seen him, so he ran backto the nagual. Tulio was there, talking with the nagual.An incredible suspicion entered don Juan's mind. He ran to the study. Tulio wasimmersed in his bookkeeping and did not even acknowledge don Juan. Don Juanasked him what was going on. Tulio was his usual self this time: He did notanswer or look at don Juan.Don Juan had at that moment another inconceivable thought. He ran to the stable,saddled two horses and asked his morning bodyguard to accompany him again. Theygalloped to the place where they had seen Tulio earlier. He was exactly wherethey had left him. He did not speak to don Juan. He shrugged his shoulders andturned his head when don Juan questioned him.Don Juan and his companion galloped back to the house. He left the man to carefor the horses and rushed into the house. Tulio was lunching with the women. AndTulio was also talking to the nagual. And Tulio was also working on the books.Don Juan sat down and felt the cold sweat of fear. He knew that the nagualJulian was testing him with one of his horrible jokes. He reasoned that he hadthree courses of action. He could behave as if nothing out of the ordinary washappening, he could figure out the test himself, or, since the nagual hadengraved in his mind that he was there to explain anything don Juan wanted, hecould confront the nagual and ask for clarification.He decided to ask. He went to the nagual and asked him to explain what was beingdone to him. The nagual was alone then, still working on his accounts. He putthe ledger aside and smiled at don Juan. He said that the twenty-one not-doingshe had taught don Juan to perform were the tools that could sever the threethousand heads of self-importance, but that those tools had not been effectivewith don Juan at all. Thus, he was trying the second method for destroyingself-importance which meant putting don Juan into the state of being called theplace of no pity.Don Juan was convinced then that the nagual Julian was utterly mad. Hearing himtalk about not-doings or about monsters with three thousand heads or aboutplaces of no pity, don Juan felt almost sorry for him.The nagual Julian very calmly asked don Juan to go to the storage shed in theback of the house and ask Tulio to come out.Don Juan sighed and did his best not to burst out laughing. The nagual's methodswere too obvious. Don Juan knew that the nagual wanted to continue the testusing Tulio. Don Juan stopped his narration and asked me what I thought about Tulio'sbehavior. I said that, guided by what I knew about the sorcerers' world, I wouldsay that Tulio was a sorcerer and somehow he was moving his own assemblage pointin a very sophisticated manner to give don Juan the impression that he was infour places at the same time.\"So what do you think I found in the shed?\" don Juan asked with a big grin.\"I would say either you found Tulio or you didn't find anybody,\" I replied.\"But if either of these had happened, there would have been no shock to mycontinuity,\" don Juan said.I tried to imagine bizarre things and I proposed that perhaps he found Tulio'sdreaming body. I reminded don Juan that he himself had done something similar tome with one of the members of his party of sorcerers.\"No,\" don Juan retorted. \"What I found was a joke that has no equivalent inreality. And yet it was not bizarre: It was not out of this world. What do youthink it was?\"I told don Juan I hated riddles. I said that with all the bizarre things he hadmade me experience, the only things I could conceive would be more bizarreness,and since that was ruled out, I gave up guessing. \"When I went into that shed I was prepared to find that Tulio was hiding,\" donJuan said. \"I was sure that the next part of the test was going to be aninfuriating game of hide-and-seek. Tulio was going to drive me crazy hidinginside that shed.\"But nothing I had prepared myself for happened. I walked into that shed andfound four Tulios.\"\"What do you mean, four Tulios?\" I asked.\"There were four men in that shed,\" don Juan replied. \"And all of them wereTulio. Can you imagine my surprise? All of them were sitting in the sameposition with their legs crossed, and pressed tightly together. They werewaiting for me. I looked at them and ran away screaming.\"My benefactor held me down on the ground outside the door. And then, trulyhorrified, I saw how the four Tulios came out of the shed and advanced towardme. I screamed and screamed while the Tulios pecked me with their hard fingers,like huge birds attacking.I screamed until I felt something give in me and I entered a state of superbindifference. Never in all my life had I felt something so extraordinary. Ibrushed off the Tulios and got up. They had just been tickling me. I wentdirectly to the nagual and asked him to explain the four men to me.\"What the nagual Julian explained to don Juan was that those four men were theparagons of stalking. Their names had been invented by their teacher, the nagualElias, who, as an exercise in controlled folly, had taken the Spanish numeralsuno, dos, tres, cuatro, and added them to the name of Tulio. He obtained in thatmanner the names Tuliuno, Tuliodo, Tulitre, and Tulicuatro.The nagual Julian introduced each in turn to don Juan. The four men werestanding in a row. Don Juan faced each of them and nodded, and each nodded tohim. The nagual said the four men were stalkers of such extraordinary talent, asdon Juan had just corroborated, that praise was meaningless.The Tulios were the nagual Elias's triumph. They were the essence ofunobtrusiveness. They were such magnificent stalkers that, for all practicalpurposes, only one of them existed. Although people saw and dealt with themdaily, nobody outside the members of the household knew that there were fourTulios.Don Juan understood with perfect clarity everything the nagual Julian was sayingabout the men. Because of his unusual clarity, he knew he had reached the placeof no pity. And he understood, all by himself, that the place of no pity was aposition of the assemblage point; a position which rendered self-pityinoperative. But don Juan also knew that his insight and wisdom were extremelytransitory. Unavoidably, his assemblage point would return to its point ofdeparture.When the nagual asked don Juan if he had any questions, he realized that hewould be better off paying close attention to the nagual's explanation thanspeculating about his own foresightedness.Don Juan wanted to know how the Tulios created the impression that there wasonly one person. He was extremely curious because observing them together herealized they were not really that alike. They wore the same clothes. They wereabout the same size, age, and configuration. But that was the extent of theirsimilarity. And yet, even as he watched them he could have sworn that there wasonly one Tulio.The nagual Julian explained that the human eye was trained to focus only on themost salient features of anything, and that those salient features were knownbeforehand. Thus, the stalkers' art was to create an impression by presentingthe features they chose, features they knew the eyes of the onlooker were boundto notice. By artfully reinforcing certain impressions, stalkers were able tocreate on the part of the onlooker an unchallengeable conviction as to whattheir eyes had perceived.The nagual Julian said that when don Juan first arrived dressed in his woman'sclothes, the women of his party were delighted and laughed openly. But the manwith them, who happened to be Tulitre, immediately provided don Juan with thefirst Tulio impression. He half turned away to hide his face, shrugged hisshoulders disdainfully, as if all of it was boring to him, and walked away- tolaugh his head off in private- while the women helped to consolidate that firstimpression by acting apprehensive, almost annoyed, at the unsociability of theman.From that moment on, any Tulio who was around don Juan reinforced thatimpression and further perfected it until don Juan's eye could not catchanything except what was being fed to him.Tuliuno spoke then and said that it had taken them about three months of verycareful and consistent actions to have don Juan blind to anything except what hewas guided to expect. After three months, his blindness was so pronounced thatthe Tulios were no longer even careful. They acted normal in the house. Theyeven ceased wearing identical clothes, and don Juan did not notice thedifference.When other apprentices were brought into the house, however, the Tulios had tostart all over again. This time the challenge was hard, because there were manyapprentices and they were sharp.Don Juan asked Tuliuno about Tulio's appearance. Tuliuno answered that thenagual Elias maintained appearance was the essence of controlled folly, andstalkers created appearance by intending them rather than by producing them withthe aid of props. Props created artificial appearances that looked false to theeye. In this respect, intending appearances was exclusively an exercise forstalkers.Tulitre spoke next. He said appearances were solicited from the spirit.Appearances were asked; were forcefully called on. They were never inventedrationally. Tulio's appearance had to be called from the spirit. And tofacilitate that, the nagual Elias put all four of them together into a verysmall, out-of-the-way storage room, and there the spirit spoke to them. Thespirit told them that first they had to intend their homogeneity. [*homogeneity- the quality of being similar or comparable in kind or nature]Afterfour weeks of total isolation, homogeneity came to them.The nagual Elias said that intent had fused them together, and that they hadacquired the certainty that their individuality would go undetected. Now theyhad to call up the appearance that would be perceived by the onlooker. And theygot busy, calling intent for the Tulios' appearance don Juan had seen. They hadto work very hard to perfect it. They focused, under the direction of theirteacher, on all the details that would make it perfect.The four Tulios gave don Juan a demonstration of Tulio's most salient features.These were: very forceful gestures of disdain and arrogance; abrupt turns of theface to the right as if in anger; twists of their upper bodies as if to hidepart of the face with the left shoulder; angry sweeps of a hand over the eyes asif to brush hair off the forehead; and the gait of an agile but impatient personwho is too nervous to decide which way to go.Don Juan said that those details of behavior and dozens of others had made Tulioan unforgettable character. In fact, he was so unforgettable that in order toproject Tulio on don Juan and the other apprentices as if on a screen, any ofthe four men needed only to insinuate a feature, and don Juan and theapprentices would automatically supply the rest.Don Juan said that because of the tremendous consistency of the input, Tulio wasfor him and the others the essence of a disgusting man. But at the same time, ifthey searched deep inside themselves, they would have acknowledged that Tuliowas haunting. He was nimble, mysterious, and gave, wittingly or unwittingly, theimpression of being a shadow.Don Juan asked Tuliuno how they had called intent. Tuliuno explained thatstalkers called intent loudly. Usually intent was called from within a small,dark, isolated room. A candle was placed on a black table with the flame just afew inches before the eyes; then the word intent was voiced slowly, enunciatedclearly and deliberately as many times as one felt was needed. The pitch of thevoice rose or fell without any thought.Tuliuno stressed that the indispensable part of the act of calling intent was atotal concentration on what was intended. In their case, the concentration wason their homogeneity and on Tulio's appearance. After they had been fused byintent, it still took them a couple of years to build up the certainty thattheir homogeneity and Tulio's appearance would be realities to the onlookers. I asked don Juan what he thought of their way of calling intent. And he saidthat his benefactor, like the nagual Elias, was a bit more given to ritual thanhe himself was, therefore, they preferred paraphernalia such as candles, darkclosets, and black tables.I casually remarked that I was terribly attracted to ritual behavior, myself.Ritual seemed to me essential in focusing one's attention. Don Juan took myremark seriously. He said he had seen that my body, as an energy field, had afeature which he knew all the sorcerers of ancient times had had and avidlysought in others: a bright area in the lower right side of the luminous cocoon.That brightness was associated with resourcefulness and a bent toward morbidity.The dark sorcerers of those times took pleasure in harnessing that covetedfeature and attaching it to man's dark side.\"Then there is an evil side to man,\" I said jubilantly. \"You always deny it. Youalways say that evil doesn't exist, that only power exists.\"I surprised myself with this outburst. In one instant, all my Catholicbackground was brought to bear on me and the Prince of Darkness loomed largerthan life.Don Juan laughed until he was coughing.\"Of course, there is a dark side to us,\" he said. \"We kill wantonly, don't we?We burn people in the name of God. We destroy ourselves; we obliterate life onthis planet; we destroy the earth. And then we dress in robes and the Lordspeaks directly to us. And what does the Lord tell us? He says that we should begood boys or he is going to punish us. The Lord has been threatening us forcenturies and it doesn't make any difference. Not because we are evil, butbecause we are dumb. Man has a dark side, yes, and it's called stupidity.\"I did not say anything else, but silently I applauded and thought with pleasurethat don Juan was a masterful debater. Once again he was turning my words backon me.After a moment's pause, don Juan explained that in the same measure that ritualforced the average man to construct huge churches that were monuments toself-importance, ritual also forced sorcerers to construct edifices of morbidityand obsession. As a result, it was the duty of every nagual to guide awarenessso it would fly toward the abstract free of liens and mortgages.\"What do you mean, don Juan, by liens and mortgages?\" I asked.\"Ritual can trap our attention better than anything I can think of,\" he said,\"but it also demands a very high price. That high price is morbidity; andmorbidity could have the heaviest liens and mortgages on our awareness.\"Don Juan said that human awareness was like an immense haunted house. Theawareness of everyday life was like being sealed in one room of that immensehouse for life. We entered the room through a magical opening: birth. And weexited through another such magical opening: death.Sorcerers, however, were capable of finding still another opening and couldleave that sealed room while still alive. A superb attainment. But theirastounding accomplishment was that when they escaped from that sealed room theychose freedom. They chose to leave that immense, haunted house entirely insteadof getting lost in other parts of it.Morbidity was the antithesis of the surge of energy awareness needed to reachfreedom. Morbidity made sorcerers lose their way and become trapped in theintricate, dark byways of the unknown.I asked don Juan if there was any morbidity in the Tulios.\"Strangeness is not morbidity\" he replied. \"The Tulios were performers who werebeing coached by the spirit itself.\"\"What was the nagual Elias's reason for training the Tulios as he did?\" I asked.Don Juan peered at me and laughed loudly. At that instant the lights of theplaza were turned on. He got up from his favorite bench and rubbed it with thepalm of his hand, as if it were a pet.\"Freedom,\" he said. \"He wanted their freedom from perceptual convention. And hetaught them to be artists. Stalking is an art. For a sorcerer, since he's not apatron or a seller of art, the only thing of importance about a work of art isthat it can be accomplished.\"We stood by the bench, watching the evening strollers milling around. The storyof the four Tulios had left me with a sense of foreboding. Don Juan suggestedthat I return home. The long drive to L.A., he said, would give my assemblagepoint a respite from all the moving it had done in the past few days.\"The nagual's company is very tiring,\" he went on. \"It produces a strangefatigue. It could even be injurious.\"I assured him that I was not tired at all, and that his company was anything butinjurious to me. In fact, his company affected me like a narcotic- I couldn't dowithout it. This sounded as if I were flattering him, but I really meant what Isaid.We strolled around the plaza three or four times in complete silence.\"Go home and think about the basic cores of the sorcery stories,\" don Juan saidwith a note of finality in his voice. \"Or rather, don't think about them, butmake your assemblage point move toward the place of silent knowledge. Moving theassemblage point is everything, but it means nothing if it's not a sober,controlled movement. So, close the door of self-reflection. Be impeccable andyou'll have the energy to reach the place of silent knowledge.\" ### \"The Power Of Silence\" - Copyright 1987 by Carlos Castaneda - The End ###"}]
