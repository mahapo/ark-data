In this sense , my boo ks are the accou nt of an on - going process which beco me s more c lear to me as time goes by - It takes year s of tra ining to teach us to dea l intelli gently with the world of everyday life. Our schoolin g — whether in plain reasoning or formal topi cs — is ri gorous, because the knowledge we are trying to impar t is very compl ex. The same cri teria apply to the sorcer ers' w orld: their schoolin g, which relies on oral instruc t io n a nd th e manip ulation of awareness, although different fro m ours, is just as r igor ous , b ecause their knowl edge is as, o r perhaps more, complex. VII Introdu ction At vario us times don Jua n att empted t o name his knowledge fo r my benefit. He fe lt that the m ost appr opriate name was naguali sm, but that the term was too obscure. Calling it sim ply \"knowledge\" made it too vag ue, and t o call it \"wit chcr aft\" was debasing. \"The maste ry of intent\" was too abstrac t, and \"the search for total freedom\" too long and metaph orical . Final ly, becaus e he was unabl e to find a m ore appr opriate name, he called it \"sorcer y ,\" although he a dmitted it was not real ly accurate. Over the year s, he had given m e dif ferent defi ni tion s of sorcer y, but he had always maintai ned that defi nitions change as knowledge increases. Towar d the end of my appr ent iceshi p, I felt I was in a positi on to appr ec iate a clearer definition, s o I as ked hi m once more. \"From where the average man stands,\" do n Juan said, \"sorcer y is non sense or an omin ous mys tery beyond his reach.

The actual time decid es the mode; the time decides w hich precise bundle o f ene rgy fie lds, out o f an in calculabl e numbe r, are to be used. And handlin g the modal ity of the time — those few, selected energy fiel ds — takes all our available energy, l eaving us nothing that would help us use any of the other energy fi elds.\" He ur ged me with a subtl e m ovement of his ey ebrows to consid e r all th is. \"Thi s is what I mean when I say that the average man lacks the energy needed to deal with sorcer y,\" he went on. \"If he uses onl y the energ y he has, he can't percei ve the worl ds sorcer ers do. To pe rcei ve the m, sorcerers need to use a clu ster of ene rgy fiel ds not ord inaril y used. Naturally, if the av erage man is to per ceive t hose worl ds and understand s orc erers' perception he must use the same clu ster they have used. And th is is just not possibl e, because all his energy is alr eady deployed.\" He paused as i f s earching fo r the appropriate wor ds to make hi s p oi nt. \"Thi nk of it this way,\" he pro ceeded. \"It isn't that as time goes by you're learning sorcer y; rather, what "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"you're learning is to sav e energy. And t his energ y will enabl e you to handle some of the energy fiel ds wh ich are inac cess ible to yo u now. And tha t is sorcer y: the a bility to use energy fields that are not emplo yed in percei ving the ord inary world we know. Sorc ery is a stat e of awareness. Sorc ery is the abili ty to percei ve somethi ng which ordinary perception cannot. \"Everything I've put you throu gh,\" don Juan went on, \"each of the things I've shown you was onl y a device to convi nce you that there's more to us than meets the eye. We don 't need an yone to teach us sorcer y, because there is reall y nothing to learn . What we need is a teacher to convi nce us that there is inc alculabl e p ower at our f ingertip s. What a s trange parad ox!

I'm trying to convi nce you that you can r each t hat power. I went throu gh the s ame thin g. And I was as hard to convince as you are.\" \"Once we h ave reached it, what exactly do we do with it, don Juan? \" \"Nothi ng. Once we have reached it, it w il l, by itself, make use of energy fields which are avai labl e to us but inac cess ibl e. And that, as I have said, is sorcer y. We begin then to see — that is, t o percei ve — something else; not as imaginati on, but as real and concrete. And then we begin to know withou t having to use words. And what any of us does with that increased percep tion, w ith that silent kno wledge, depends on our own temp erament.\" On another occasion, he gav e me another kind of explanation. We were discuss ing an unr e lated topi c when he abruptly changed the subject and began to tell me a joke . He la ughed and, very"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"gently, patted my back between the shoul der blades, as if he were shy and it was too for ward of him to touch me. He chuck led at my nervous reac tion . \"You 're sk ittish,\" he said teasingly, and slapped my back wi th greater force. My ears buz zed. For an instant I lo st my breath. It felt as though he had hur t my lun gs . Every breath brought me great discomf ort. Yet, after I had coughed and choked a few times, my nasal passag e s opened and I fou nd mys elf taking deep, soothin g breaths. I had such a feeli ng of well - bein g that I was not even annoyed at him fo r his blow, wh ich had been hard as wel l as unexpected. Then don Juan began a most remarkabl e expl anation . Clearl y and concisely, he gav e me a dif fe rent an d more precise definition of sorcery. I had entered into a wondrous stat e of awareness! I had such clarity of mind that I was able to compr ehend and ass imi late everything don Juan was say ing . He said that in the universe there is an unmeasurabl e, indescribable force which sorcerers call intent, and that absolu tely everything that exists in the entir e cosmos is attached to int ent by a conn ecting li nk. Sorc erers, or warrior s, as he cal led them, were concerned with discussin g, un derstanding, and employing that connecting li nk. They were especiall y c oncer ned with cleaning it of the numbi ng effects bro ught about by the ordinar y c oncerns of their everyday li ves . Sorc e ry at this level could be defined as the procedure of cleaning one's conn ecting link to intent. Don Juan stress ed that this \"cleani ng pro c edure\" was extremely dif ficult t o understand, or to learn t o perform. Sorcere rs, therefore, divided the ir instruc tion into two categories. One was instruc tion for the everyday - li fe stat e of awareness, in which t he cleaning pro cess w as pres ented in a disgui sed fashio n. The other was instruction fo r the stat e s of heightened awareness, such as the one I was presently experienc ing, in wh ich sorcerers obtain ed knowl edge d ir ectly from intent, without the di stracting intervention of spoken language . Don Juan expl ained that by using heightened awareness over thousands of years of painful strugg le, sorcer ers had gaine d speci fic insights in t o i ntent; and that they had passe d these nuggets of direct knowledge on from generation to generation to the pres ent. He said th at the task of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"sorcer y is to take this seemingly inc omprehensibl e knowledge and make it under standab le by the standards of awareness of eve ryday li fe. Then he explain e d the rol e of t he g uid e in t he l ives of sorcerers. He s aid that a g uid e is cal led \"the n a - gual,\" and that the nagual is a man or a woma n with extraordi nary energy, a teacher who has sobri ety, endurance, stability; someone seer s see as a lumi nou s sphere having four compar tments , as if four luminous ball s have been compr ess ed together. Because of their extraordi nary energy, nagua ls are inter mediaries . Thei r ene rgy all ows them to channel peace, harmo ny, laughter, and kn owledge directly from the source, fro m intent, and tra nsmit them to their companions. Naguals are responsib le f or sup plyi ng what sorcer ers call \"the mini ma l chance\": the awareness of o ne's connection with intent. I told him that my mind was grasping everything he was telli ng me, that the onl y part of his explanatio n still unclear to me was why two sets of teach ings were needed. I c ould understand everything he was say ing about his worl d easi ly, and yet he had described the process of under standing as very dif ficu lt. \"You will need a li fetime to remember the insights you've had today,\" he said, \"because most of them were silent kn owledge. A few m oments fro m now you will have forgotten them. That's one of the unfathomable myst eri es of awaren ess .\" Don Juan t hen made me shift levels of consciousne ss by s triki ng me on my left side, at the e dge of my ri bcage. Inst antly I lo st my ex tra ord inary clarity of min d an d co uld not remember having ever had it. ... Don Juan himself set me the task of writi ng about the premi ses of sorcer y. Once, very casuall y in the earl y stag es of my app renticeship, he sugges ted that I wri te a book in order to m ake use of the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"notes I had always taken. I had accu mulated reams of notes and never consider ed what to do with them. I argued that the sugges tion was absurd because I was not a wr iter. \"Of cour se, you're not a writer, \" he said, \"so you will have to use s orc ery. Fir st, you must visuali ze your exper iences as if you were reliving them, and then you must see the text in your dreaming. For you, writing should not be a literary exercise, but r ather an exerc ise in sorcery.\" I have written in that manner about t he premises of sorcery just as don J uan explained them to me, wi thin the context of his teaching. In his teaching scheme, wh ich was devel oped by sorcer ers of a nci ent times, there were two categories of instruc tion. One was call ed \"teachin gs for the ri ght side,\" carried out in the ordinary stat e of awareness. The other was call ed \"teachings for the left side,\" put into practi ce solely in stat e s of h eightened awareness . These two categories allowed teachers to sch ool the ir a ppr ent ices toward th ree areas of expertise: the mastery of awareness, the ar t of sta lkin g, and the mastery of intent. These three areas of expertise are the th ree riddl es sorcerers encounter in their search for knowledge. The mastery of awarenes s is the r iddle of the min d; the perp lexi ty sorcerer s exper ience whe n they reco gnize the astounding mystery and scope of awareness and percep tion. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The art of stalking is the ri ddl e of the heart; the puzzlement sorcer ers feel upon becoming aware of two th ings: first that the world appears to us t o be unalterably objective and factual, because of pecul iarit ies of our awareness and pe rcepti on; se cond, that if different peculiarities of perception come into play, the very things about the world that seem so unal terably objective and factual change. The maste ry of intent is the ri ddl e of the spirit, or the paradox of the abstract — sorcer ers' thoughts and ac tions projected beyond our huma n co ndition. Don Juan's instruc tion on the art of stalking and the maste ry of intent depended upo n his instruc tion o n the maste ry of awareness, which was the cor nerstone of his teachings, and which consist of the fo ll ow ing b asic premises: 1. T he universe is an infinite agglomeration of energy fi elds, resembling threads o f l ight. 2. These energy fiel ds, ca ll ed the Ea gle's emanation s, radiate from a source of inconceivable pro portions metapho ri ca ll y ca ll ed the E agle. 3.

Onl y a very small group of the energy fields inside this luminous ball are lit up by a point of intense bril liance loc ated on the ball's surf ace. 5.

Since the onl y ene rgy fields perceivabl e a re those li t by the point of brilliance, that point is named \"the poi nt where perception is assem bled \" or simply \"t he assemblage poi nt.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 6. The ass emblage po int can be moved fro m its u sual position on the su rface of the luminou s ball to another pos iti on on the surface, or into the inter ior. Sinc e the brilliance of the ass emblage poi nt can li ght up whatev er energy fiel d it conies in contact with, when it moves t o a new position it immediately bri ghtens up new energy fiel ds, makin g them percei vable. Thi s percep tion is known as see ing. 7. When the assemblage poi nt shifts, it makes possibl e the percep tion of an entir e ly dif fe rent worl d — as objecti ve and factual as the one we nor mally percei ve. Sorc erers go into that other worl d to get energy, power, so luti ons to gen eral and particular problems, or to face the uni maginable. 8. Intent is the pervasive force that causes us to percei ve. We do not become aware because we percei ve; rather, we perceive as a r esult of the pr ess ure and i nt rusio n of in tent. 9. Th e aim of sorcerers is to reach a stat e of total awareness in order to exper ience a ll the possibi lities of perception availabl e to man. This stat e of awareness e ven impl ies an alternati ve way of dyi ng. A leve l of practical kn owledge was included as par t of teaching the maste ry of aw arenes s. On that practi ca l level don Juan taught the pro cedur es ne cess ary to move the assemblage poi nt. The two great systems devised by the sorcer er seers of anci ent times to accomplish th is were: dreaming, the con trol and ut il i zati on of dreams; and stalking, the con trol of behavio r. Moving one's assemblage point was an e ss ential maneuver that every sorcerer had to learn. Some of them, the naguals, a lso learned to perform it for others. They were able to dislodge the ass emblage poi nt fro m its customary position by deli vering a hard slap directly to the ass emblage poi nt. This blow, wh ich was experienc e d as a smack on the right shoulder blade — a ltho ugh the bod y was neve r to uched — resulted in a stat e of he ightened awaren ess . "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In compl iance with his tradi t io n, it was exclusively in these states of heightened awareness that don Juan carried out the most important and dramatic part of his teach ings: the instruc tions for the left side. Because of the e xtraord inary qual ity of these states, don Juan demanded that I not discuss them with others until we had c oncluded everything in the sorcerers' teaching scheme. That demand was not dif ficult for me to acce pt. In those uni que stat e s of awareness m y capabili ties for understanding the instruc tion wer e unbel ievably enhanced, but at the same time my capabi lities for describ ing or even remembering it were impaired. I could functi on in th ose stat e s with pro fic iency and ass ured ness, but I coul d not recoll e ct anything about them once I return ed to my no rmal consciousnes s. It took me years to be able to make the c ruc ial c onversio n of my enhanced awareness into plain memory. My reason and c ommon sense delayed this moment because they were c ol liding head - on with t he p repo sterous, unthinkable reality of he i ghtened awareness and d ir ect kn owledge. For years the resulti ng cognitive disarrangement forced me to avoid the issue by no t th inki ng about it. Whatever I have written about my sorcer y appr enticeship, up to now, has been a reco unting of how don Juan taugh t me the mastery of awareness. I have not yet describ ed the art of stalking or the mastery of i ntent. Don Juan taught me the ir principl es and a pplications with the help of two of his c ompanion s: a sorcer er named Vicente Medrano and another nam ed Sil vio Ma nuel, but whateve r I learn ed fro m them still remain s clo uded in what don Juan calle d the intr icacies of heightened awareness. Until now it has been imposs ibl e for me to write or ev en to think coherently about the art of stalki ng and the maste ry of intent. My mistake has been to regard them as subjects for norma l memo ry and recoll ection. They are, but at the same time they are not. In ord er to resolve this contr adiction, I have not pur sued the subjects dir ectly — a virtual impo ss ibility — but have dealt with th em indir ect ly through the concluding to pic of don Jua n's instruc tion: the stories of the sorcer ers of the past. He reco unted these stories to make evident what he call ed the abstract cores of his lessons. But I was inc apabl e of grasping the nature of the abstract cor es despite his compr ehensive explanatio ns, which, I know now, were intend ed more to open my mind than to explain anything in a rational manner. H is way of talking made me beli eve for many years that his explanatio ns of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the abstract cor es were l ike academic disserta tion s; and a ll I was able to do, under these cir cumstances, was to take his explanations as given. They became part of my tacit acceptance of his teachings, but w itho ut the th orough ass ess ment on my part that was essential to under stan ding them. Don Juan presented three sets of six abstract cor es each, arr a nged in a n increasing level of compl exity. I have dealt here with the fir st set, which is composed of the fol lo wing: the manif esta tion s of the spirit, the kn ock of the spirit, the tr ickery of the sp ir it, the descent of the spiri t, the requi rements of intent, and handling intent. 1 The Mani festat io ns of the S pirit THE FIRST ABSTRACT CORE Don Juan, whenever it was perti ne nt, used to t ell me brief stor ies about the so rcer ers of his l ineage, especially his teacher, the nagual Julian. They were not reall y stories, but rather descrip tions of the way those sorcer ers behaved and of aspects of their personaliti es. These accou nts were each designed to shed light on a specifi c topic in my app renti ceship. I had heard the same st ori es fro m t he other fifteen members of don Juan's g rou p of s orc e rers, but non e of these accounts had been able to give me a clear pic tu re of the people they describ ed. Sinc e I had no way of persuading don Juan to give me more details about th ose sorcer ers, I had resigned myself to the idea of never knowing abo ut them i n any depth.

For sorcer e rs their past is what other sorcer ers in bygone days ha ve don e. And what we are now going to do is examine that past . \"The average man also examines the past.

H e was sayin g that the fir st sorcer y story conc erning the manif esta tion s of the spirit was an account of the rel ationshi p between intent and the nagual. It was the story of how the spirit set up a lure for the nagual, a prospective disciple, and of how the nagual had to eval uate the lure before making hi s dec isio n either to accept or reject it. It was very dark in the cave, and the smal l spac e was conf ining. O rd inarily an area of that size woul d have made me clau stro phobic, but the c ave kept soothin g me, dispelling my feelings of annoyance. Also, someth ing in the configuration of the cave absorbed the echoes of don Juan's words. Don Juan explain ed that every act perf ormed by sorcer ers, especially by the naguals, was either perf ormed as a way to strengthen their link w ith intent or as a resp onse triggered by the link itself. Sorce rers, a nd spec ifi ca ll y the nag uals, the refore ha d to be actively a nd permanen tly on t he lo okout for man ifestations of the spirit. Such ma nif esta tion s were call ed ges tures of the spirit or, more simply, indications or omens.

Using his healer's knowledge, he st opp e d the bleeding, to ok don Juan, who was still unco nscious, home and cured him. The indicati ons the spiri t gav e the na gual Juli an about don Juan were , fir st, a small cyclone that li fted a c one of dust on the road a couple of yards fro m where he lay. T he second omen was the thought which had c rossed the nagual Juli an's mind an instant befor e he had heard the report of the g un a few y ards away: that it was time to have an apprentic e nag ual.

A colli sion with someon e was the type of blunder which no sorcerer, m uch less a nagual, sh ould ever make. The nagual J ul ian immediately evaluated the opp ortunity.

In a more me ll ow t one he added that heightened awareness did not reveal everything until the whol e edif ice of sorcery knowledge was compl eted. Then he answered my question about whether or not sorcerers could misinter pret omens. He explain ed that when a so rcer er interpreted an omen he knew its exact meaning withou t having any noti on of how he knew it. This was one of th e bewil de ri ng ef fects of the conne cting li nk with intent. Sorc erers had a sense of knowing things dir ectly. How sure they were depended on the strength and cl arity of their connecting li nk. He s aid that the feeling ev eryone knows as \"intui t io n\" is t he activat io n of our li nk w ith intent. And since sorcerers de li be rately pursue the understa ndi ng and strengtheni ng of that link, it could be said that they intui t everything uner ri ngly and accur ately.

The entire truth is that the spirit reveals itself to everyone with the same intensity and consist ency, but o nly so rcer ers, a nd naguals in particular, are att uned to such revelations.\" Don Juan began his story. He said that the nagual Elías had been riding his horse to the city one day, taking him throu gh a shortcut by some cor nfields when suddenl y his horse shied , frightened by the lo w, fast swee p of a falcon that m issed the nagual's straw hat by onl y a few inches.

Subsequently the nagual saw him on the stage often enough to reali ze that the actor had a great deal of charisma. The audi ence, especially the wo men, loved him. And he had no scruples about making use of his c hari smatic gi fts to seduce fe male admir e rs. As the nagual follo wed the act or, he wa s able to witness his seducti on techniq ue m ore than once.

The nagual had seen the blac k shadow of death that followed h im everyw here. Don Juan explain e d again something he had to ld me years before — that our death was a black spot ri ght behi nd the left shoul der. He said that so rcer e rs knew when a person was clo se to dying because t hey co uld s ee the dark spot, which became a moving shado w the exact size and shape of the person to whom it belonged.

He had been taught that in a natura l st ate repl acement, not re pair, pr evailed. And t he nagual doubted t hat he had the ability or the strength to heal th is young man, or resist the blac k sha dow of his death. He even dou bted if he would be able to discover why th e spiri t had involved him in a displ ay of such obvio us wast e. The nagual c ould do nothing but stay with the actor, fol lo w him around, and wait for the opp ortunity to see in greater depth. Don Juan ex plai ne d that a nagua l's first re action, upon being faced with the manif esta tion s of the spiri t , is to see the persons invol ved. The nagual El ías had"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"been meticul ous about seeing the man the moment he lai d eyes on him. He had also seen the peasant woman who was part of the spiri t's manif e stat io n, but he had seen nothing that, in his judgment, co uld hav e warran ted the spirit's di splay . In the cour se of witnessing another seduct io n, ho weve r, the nagual's ability to see took on a new depth. Thi s time the actor's adoring fan was the daughter of a ri c h landowner. And from the start she was in compl ete control. The nagual foun d out about their rend ezvous because he overheard her daring the actor to meet her the next day. T he nagual was hid ing acro ss the street at dawn when the young woman left h er hou se, and instead of going to early mass she went to join the actor. The actor was waiting for her and she coaxed him into following her to the open fields. He appeared to hesitate, but she taunted him and wo uld not allow him to withdraw. As the nagua l watched them sneaking away, he had an abso lute conviction that something was going to happen on that day which neither of the players was anticipati ng. He s aw that the a ctor's blac k shadow had grown to almost twice his height. The nagual deduced fro m the mys terio us hard lo ok in the young woman's eyes that she too had felt the black shadow of death at an intui tive level. Th e actor seemed preoccupied. He did not l a ugh as he h ad on other occ asi ons. They walked quite a distance. At one point, th ey spotted th e nagual following them, but he instantly pretended to be workin g the land , a pea sant who belo nged there. That made the coup le rel ax and allowed the nagual to come closer. Then the moment came when the actor t ossed off his clothes and showed himself to th e girl. But instead of s wooning and falling into h is arms as his other conquest s had, t his g ir l began to h it him. She kicked and punched him merciless ly and stepped on hi s ba re toes, him c ry ou t with pain. The nagual knew the man had not threatened or har med the young woman. He had not laid a fin ger on her. She was the onl y one fighting. He was merely trying to parr y the blo ws, and persistently, b ut without enthus iasm, tr ying to entice her by showing her his g enital s.

He co uld perce ive t hat t he actor w as an ir redeemable liberti ne, but he could also pe rcei ve equally eas il y that there was something uniq ue, althou gh revolting, about him. It baffl ed the nagual to see that the man's conn ecting li nk with the spiri t was ex traor dina rily cl ear. Finally the attack ended. The woman stop ped beating the actor. But then, instead of run ning away, she surren dered, lay down and told the act or he could now h ave h is way with her .

The nagual was laughi ng and pon dering that useless man's great stamina and determin ation when the woman screamed a nd the actor began to gas p. The nagual saw how the blac k shadow struck the actor. It went li ke a dagger, with pinpoint accuracy into his gap.

The woman in the meantime had stood up a nd withou t so much as a glance at the man , whose bod y was contorting with death spasms , wal ked a way. The nagual then saw her luminosi ty and realized that her extreme agg res s iveness was the result of an enormous flow of supe rfluou s energy. He became convi nced that if she did not put that energy to sober use, it woul d get the best of he r and there was no telli ng what misfor tunes it woul d cause her. As the na gual watched the un conc ern with which she walked away, he reali zed that the spiri t had given him another manif esta tion . He needed to be calm, non c halan t.

By the time the actor was breathi ng again, the nag ual had become aware of the magnitude of his responsibil ity.

And the nagual Elías had sai d that the spiri t itself had made it possible. Thi s was the case with everything a nagual under took, pro viding he followed the spirit's m anif esta tion s. The first thing the nagual Elías did, when the a ctor was breathing again, was to run after the young woman. She was an impo rtant part of the spiri t's manif esta tion . He caught up with her not too far from the spot where the actor lay barely ali ve.

The theory of the sorcer ers was that the nature of the rock and the manner in which it had b een carved allowed the tw o b odies, the two lumi nous ba ll s, to inte rtwine their energy . \"I took you to that ca ve on pur pose,\" he conti nued, \"not because I li ke the plac e — I don 't — but because it was cre ated a s an instrumen t to push th e appr entice deep into heightened awareness.

That's the difficul t par t .\" He remin ded me of something he had told me often: that volun teers were not welcome in the sorcer ers' world, because they alr eady had a pur pose of their own, which made it particularly hard for them to rel inquish their individ uality. If th e sorcer ers' worl d demanded ideas and action s contr ary to the volunteers' purpose, the volunteers simply ref used to change. \"Reviving an appr entice's li nk is a nagual's most chal lengin g and intr iguing work,\" don Juan conti nued, \"and one of his biggest headaches to o.

Don Juan was inc apabl e of conc eiving of this transformation as anything but an example o f a c onsummate actor 's art. \"How d id he accomplish those changes ?\" I asked. \"He was both a magician and an artist,\" don Juan repl ied. \"His magic was that he transfor med himself by moving his ass emblage poi nt into the positi on that woul d bring on whateve r parti cular change he d esired.

For all the sorcer e rs of don Juan's party the death defi er was a most vivid charac ter. Accordin g t o them, the death defi er was a sorcer er of anci e nt times.

In doi ng so they had discovered extraordinary li ngs about percep t io n, but they had also disc overed how easy it was to get lo st in abe rr ation. The death defi er's situation was for don Juan a c lassic example of an aberration. Don Juan used to repeat every chance he coul d that the ass emblage poi nt was pushed by someone who not only saw it but also had enou gh energy to move it, so that it sl id, within the lumi nous ball, to whateve r location the pus her directed. Its bri lliance was enough to li ght up the threadl ike ene rgy fiel ds it touched.

His wife had also changed fro m a sour, fat Ind ian to a beautif ul slender young woman. The woman, of c our se, hadn't transformed herself the way my benefac tor had.

Don Juan did not allo w me to drink coffee or tea. \"While you are using my e nergy,\" he said, \"you're not in your own time. You are in mine.

He did not invi te me in. I just follo wed him. I was curiou s to see who had o pe ned the doo r from the inside , but there w as no o ne there. The inter ior of the hou se was very soothin g. Ther e were no pic tures on the smooth, scrupu lously clean walls. Ther e were no lamps or boo k shelv es either. A golden yel lo w tile floor contraste d most pleasin gly with the off - white color of the walls. We were in a small and narrow hall that opened into a spacious li vi ng roo m with a high ceil ing and a brick firepl a ce. Half the room was compl etely empty, b ut next to the firepl ace was a semicir c le of expensive furnitur e : two lar ge beige couc hes in the midd le, flanked by two armchai rs covered in fabric of the same col or. Ther e was a heavy, rou nd, so li d oak coffee table in the center. Judging from what I was s eeing arou nd the hou se, the people who lived there appeared to be well off, but fru gal. And they obviously li ked to sit arou nd the fir e. Two men, perh a ps in their mid - fifties, sat in the armchai rs. They stoo d when we entered. One of them was Indian, the ot her Latin Americ a n. Don Juan intr oduced me fir st to the Indian , who was nearer to me. \"Thi s is Sil vi o Manuel,\" don Jua n said to me. \"He's the most powerf ul and dangerou s sorcer e r of my party, an d the most mys terio us too.\" Sil vio Manue l's features were ou t of a Mayan fresco. His compl exion was pale, almost yello w. I thought he looked C hinese. His eyes w ere s lanted, but w itho ut t he e pic anthic fold. They were b ig, blac k, and brilliant. He was beardl ess. His hair was jet - blac k with specks of gray in it. He ha d high cheekbones and full li ps. He was perhaps five fe et sev en, thin, w ir y, a nd he wore a yello w sport shirt, brown slacks, and a th in beige jacket.

He was a bit taller than Sil vio Man uel, but just as lean. He had a pin kish complexion and a neatly trimmed bea rd and mustache. H is features were almost del icate: a t hin , beaut ifull y chiseled nose, a small mouth, thin lips. Bushy, dark eyebr ows contr aste d with his graying beard and hair. His eyes were b rown and also brilliant and laughed in spite of his frowning ex pression. He wa s conserva tively dressed in a greenish seersucker suit and open - collar ed spo rt shirt. He too seemed to be Mexican - American. I gues sed him t o b e the owner of the house. In contr ast, don Juan lo oked li ke an Indian peon. His straw hat, his worn - out shoes, hi s ol d khaki pants and plai d s hir t were those of a garden er o r a handyman. The impress io n I had, upon seeing a ll th ree of th em together, was that don Juan was in disg uise. The military image came to me that don Juan was the command ing officer of a clandest ine oper ation, an officer who, no matter how hard he tried, could not hide his ye ars of command. I also had the feeling that they must all have been around the same age, althou gh don Juan lo oked much older than the other two, yet seemed infinitely stronge r. \"I think you a lr eady know t hat C arl os is by far the biggest indul ger I hav e e ver me t,\" don Juan to ld them with a most serious expression. \"Bigg er even than our benefactor.

Don Juan turned to me. \"Come on, \" he said in a soft voice and pointed with a quick sideways movement of his head to the back of the house. It was more than obvio us that the two men did not li ke me. I did not know wh at to say . I was defi nitely angry and hurt, but those fee li ngs were somehow defl ected by my stat e of heightened awareness. We walked into t he backya rd. Don Juan ca sually picked up a leather rop e a nd twirled it around my neck with tremendous speed. His mov ements were so fast and so nimble that an instant later, befor e I could realize what was happen ing, I was tied at the neck, li ke a dog, to one of the two cin der - block columns supporting the heavy roof o ver the back porch. Don Juan shook his head fro m side to side in a ges ture of resignation or disbelief and went back into the house as I began to yel l at him t o unti e me.

Then I grabbed the rop e, twist ed it a rou nd my for ea rms, and b racing my feet against the cinder - block co lumn, pulled. But the l eather was too tough for the strength of my muscles. I felt humiliated and scared. Fear brought me a moment of sobriety. I knew I had l et don Juan's false aur a of reasonabl eness decei ve me.

Don Juan reiterated that a very impo rtant point to consider was that, to an onlo oker, t he behavior of sorcerers might appear malicious, when in r ea lity their behavior was always impeccable. \"How can you tell the difference, if you're at the re ceivin g end?\" I asked. \"Malic ious acts are performed by people for per s onal gai n,\" he said. \"Sorc e rers, t hou gh, have an ulter ior purpose for their acts, which has nothi ng to do with personal gain.

Sometimes, though, the threshol d is reached almost immed iately.

I told him that I did not agree with his point, becaus e I coul d not acce pt that there was only one threshol d to c ross. Don Juan looked heavenward in dismay and sh ook his head in a joking ges ture of despair. I pro ceeded with my argument, not to disagree with him, but to clar ify things in my mind .

He said that the nagual El ms had stopped the young actor's death by making him shift into heightened aware ness, and following hours of strugg le, the young actor regained consciousness. The nagual El f as di d not mention his name, but he intr oduced himself as a pro fessional healer wh o had stumbled onto the scene of a tragedy, where two persons had nea rl y died. He po inted to t he y oung woman, Talia, stretched o ut on t he g round. The young man was astonished to s ee her lying unconsciou s next to him. He remembered seeing he r as she ran away.

Don Juan commented that women are ca pabl e of such a maste r stroke: they can permanen tly maintai n a new position of their ass emblage poi nt . And Tali a was peerl ess . As soon as her chai ns were br oken, she immediately understood everyt hin g and complied with the nagual's designs. Don Juan, reco unting his story, said that the nagual El ías — who was not only a superb dreamer, but also a superb stalker — had seen that the young actor was spoil ed and conceited, but only seemed to be hard and call oused. The nagual knew that if he bro ught for th the idea of God, sin, and r etr ibu tion , the actor's religiou s beli e fs woul d make hi s cynical attitude collapse.

He wanted to express his fur y , but h is pain was so sev ere that he could not react to the i ndignity. \"If you want me to ease your pain, you must obey me bli ndl y ,\" the nagual said with frightening col dnes s. \"Signal me with a nod .

The nagual tap ped him on his back and his pain vanished. But along with the searing pain, something else vanished: the fog in his mind . And then the yo ung actor knew everything withou t understanding anything. The nagua l intr oduced himself again. He told him that his n ame was El ías, and that he was the na gual. And the actor knew what it all meant. The nagual Elías the n shifted his attention t o th e semi - conscious Talia. He put his mouth t o her left ear and whispered c ommands to her in ord e r to make her ass emblage poi nt stop its errati c shiftin g. He soo thed her fear by telling her, in whis pers, stories of sorcerers who h ad g one throu gh the same thing she was experienc ing. When she was fair ly calm, he introduced himself as the nagual Elías, a sorcer er; and then he attempted with her the most dif ficult thing in sorcer y: moving the assemblage poi nt bey ond the sphere of the w orld we know. Don Juan remarked that seas oned sorcer ers are capabl e of moving beyond the world we know, but that inexperienced persons a re not. The nag ual Elías always maintai ned that ordinarily he woul d not have dreamed of attempting such a fe at, but on that day something other than his knowledge or his vol ition was mak ing him act.

He sat between the two peopl e stretched out on t he groun d — the actor was naked, covered onl y by t he nagual Elías 's ridin g c oat — and reviewed their situation . He told them they had both, by the for ce of cir cumstances, fall en into a trap set by the spiri t itself. He, the nagual, was the active part of that trap, because by encountering them under the con ditions he h a d, he had been forced to become their temporary p rotector and to engage his knowledge of so rcer y in ord e r to help them. As their temp orar y pro tecto r it was his duty to warn them that the y were a bou t to reach a uni que threshol d; and that it was up to them, both ind iv idu ally and t ogether, to attain that thresh ol d by enterin g a mood of aba ndo n but not recklessness ; a mood of caring but not indulgence. He did not want to say more for fear of conf usin g them or influencing their decision. He felt that if they were to cro ss that threshol d, it had to be with minimal help from him. The nagual then left them alon e i n that isol ated s pot and w ent t o the city t o arrange fo r medicinal herb s, mats, and blankets to be brought to them. His idea was that in so li tude they would attain and c ross that threshol d. For a long t ime the two young people lay nex t to each other, immersed in their own thoughts. The fact that their ass emblage poi nts had shifted me ant that the y coul d think in greater depth than ordinaril y, but it also meant that they worr ied, pon dered, and were afraid in e qually greater depth. Sinc e Talia could talk and was a bit stronger, she bro ke their si lence; she aske d the young act or if he was afrai d. He nodded affi rmatively. She felt a great compassion for him and to ok off a shawl she was wea ri ng to pu t over his shoulders, and sh e hel d his hand. The young man did not dare voice what he felt. H is fear that his pain wo uld recur if he spoke was too great a nd too vivid. He wanted to apol ogize to her; to tell her that his onl y regret was ha ving hur t her, and that it did not matter that he was go ing to die — for he knew with certain ty that he was not goin g to survive the day.

She told him that her death was very near, too, and that she w as glad i t all would end that day. The young actor, hearing his own thoughts bein g spoken by Talia, felt a c hill. A surge of energy came t o h im then a nd made him s it up. He w as not in pain, nor w as he co ughing. He t ook in great gulps of air, something he had no memory of having done before. He took the girl 's hand and they began to talk without vocalizing. Don Juan said it was at that instant that the spiri t came to them . And they saw. They wer e deeply Catholi c , and what they saw was a vision of heaven, where everything was ali ve, bathed in li ght. They saw a worl d of miraculous sights. When t he nagual returned, t hey were ex hausted , althou gh not injured. Talia was unconscio us, but the young man had managed to rem ain aware by a supreme effor t of self - control. He insisted on whisperi ng something in the nagual 's ear. \"We saw heaven,\" he whispered, tears rolling do wn hi s cheeks. \"You saw mo re than that,\" the nagual Elías retorted. \"You saw the spiri t.\" Don Juan sai d that since the spiri t's descent is a lways shrou ded, naturally, Talia and the young actor could not hold onto their visi on. They soon for got it, as anyone would. The uniqueness of their experienc e was that, withou t any training and withou t being aware of it, they had dreamed together and had seen the spiri t. For them to have achi eved this with such ease was qui te out of the or dinary. \"Tho se two were really the most remarkable beings I have ever met,\" d on Juan added.

He said that this was all there was abo ut his benefactor and th e fou rth abstract core. He seemed to remember something he was not telli ng me and laughed upr oariou sly. Then he patted me on the back and told me it was time to s et out f or the cave. When we got t o the roc k ledge it was a lmost dark. Don Juan sat down hurri e dly, in the same positi on as the fir st time. He was to my ri ght, to uching me with his shoul der. He immedi ately seemed to enter into a deep stat e of rel axation, w hic h pu ll ed me into t otal immobility and silence. I coul d not e ven hear his breathing.

Final ly I gav e up my resistan ce and was pul led into the deepest, blac kest sleep I have e ver had. Yet I was not totally asleep. I c ould feel th e thick blackness arou nd me.

Wher ever I lo oked, I saw familiar features: rocks, hills, rivers, for ests , canyons, enhanced and t r ansformed by their inner vibration, their inner glow. This glow that was so pl easing to my eyes also tingled ou t of my very being. \"You r ass emblage po int has moved,\" don Juan see med to say to me. The words had no sound; nevertheless I knew wh at he had ju st said to me.

I speculated that fog must have covered the ledge and filled th e cave. Or perh aps it was the wispy lo w clouds that descended every rai ny night f rom the hi gher mou nta ins like a silent avalanche. Yet in spite of the total blackness , somehow I saw th at don Juan had opened his eyes immedi ately after I became aware, althou gh he did not look at me. In stantly I reali zed that seeing him was not a con sequence of light on my retina. It was, rather, a bodily sense. I became so engrossed in observin g don Juan wit hou t my eyes that I was not paying attention to what he was telli ng me. Final ly he stop ped talking and turned his face to me as if to look me in the eye. He coughed a c ouple of times to clear his throat and started to talk in a very low voice. He said that his benefactor used to come to the cave qui te often, both with him and with his other disci ples, but more often by himself . In that cave his benefactor saw the same prai ri e we had j ust seen, a visio n that g ave him the idea of descr ibing the spi ri t as the flow of th ings.

It was a me lo dic, r hythmical s oun d that emerged from the tota l blacknes s that surro unded me. He said that at th at very moment I was not in my normal stat e of awareness nor was I in heightened awareness. I was suspended in a lul l, in the blac kness of non percep t io n. My ass emblage poi nt had moved away fro m percei vi ng the dail y worl d, but it had not moved enough to rea ch and li ght a totally new bundle of energy fiel ds. Prop erly speaking, I was cau ght between two percep tual possibili ties. Thi s in - between stat e, this lul l of percep t io n had been reached throu gh the influence of the cave, which was itself guided by the inte nt of the sorcerers who carved i t. Don Juan aske d me to pay clo se attention to what he was going to say next. He said that thousands of years ago, by means of seeing, so rcerers became aware that the earth was sentient and that its awareness could affect t he awareness of humans. They tried to find a way to use the earth's influen ce on human awareness and they discovered that certain caves were most effective. Don Juan said that the search for c aves became nearl y ful l - time work for those sorcer ers, and that through their e ndeavors the y were able to discover a variety of uses for a variety of cave configurations. He added that out of a ll that wo rk the only resu lt pertinent to us was this parti cul ar cave and its capaci ty to move the assemblage poi nt until it re ac hed a lull of percep tion. As don Juan spoke, I had the unse ttling sensat io n that something was clear ing in my mind . Somethin g was funn ell ing my awareness into a lo ng narrow chann e l.

For inst ance, I knew that I was dreami ng. I was actuall y sound asleep yet I was totally aware of mys elf throu gh my second attention — the c oun terpart of my normal attentivenes s. I was certain I was asleep because of a bodil y sensat io n plus a rat io nal de ducti on based on stat ements that don Juan had made in the past. I had just seen the Eagle's e manation s, a nd don J uan had said that it was impo ss ibl e for sorcer e rs to have a sust ained view of the Eagle's emanations in any way e xcept in dreami ng, therefore I had to be dreaming. Don Juan had explained that the universe is made up of energy fields which defy descrip tion or scrutin y. He had said that they resembled fil ame nts of ordinar y light, except that li ght is lifeless compar ed to the Eagle's emanation s , which exud e awareness. I had never, until this night, been able to see them in a sust ained manner, and inde ed they were made out of a li ght that was ali ve. Don Juan had maintained in the past that my kno wledge and contr ol of int ent were not adequate to withstand the impact of that sight. He had explain ed t hat normal percep tion occurs when intent, which is pur e energy, li ghts up a por tion of the lumi nou s filaments insid e our cocoon, and at the same time bri ghtens a lo ng extens io n of the same lumi nous filaments extending into inf inity outside our cocoon. Extraordinary percep tion , seeing, occurs when by the force of intent, a differ ent cl uster of energy fiel ds energizes and lights up. He had s aid that when a cru cial numbe r of energy fields a re lit up inside the luminou s c ocoon, a so rcer er is able to see the energy fields themselves. On another occasion don Juan had recounted the ratio nal th inki ng of the early sorcerers. He told me that, through their seeing, they reali zed tha t awaren ess took plac e when the energy fields insid e our luminous cocoon we re aligned with th e same energy fiel ds outs ide.

Upon c lo se examination, however, it became evi dent that what the y had ca ll ed alignment of the Eagle's emanation s did not entir e ly explain what they were seeing. They had noti ced that onl y a very small portion of the total number of luminous filaments insid e the cocoon was energized whil e the rest remain ed unal tered. Se e ing these few fil aments energized had c reated a false discovery.

They fe lt they could not c onti nue to ca ll it awareness, as they had, because awareness was the glow o f the energy fields being lit up. So the force that lit up the fi e lds was named will . Don Juan had said that when their seeing beca me still more sophi sticated an d effective, they reali zed that will was the for ce that kept the E agle's emanation s separated and was not onl y responsible for our awareness, but also for everything in the uni verse. They saw tha t this for ce had total consci ous ness and that it sprang fro m th e very fiel ds of energy tha t made the uni verse. They decid ed then that intent was a more appr opriate name for it than will . In the lo ng run , however, the name proved disadvantageous, be cause it does not describe its overwhelming impo rtance nor the living conn ect io n it has with e verything in the universe. Don Juan had ass erted that our great collective flaw is that we li ve our li ves compl etely disregard ing that connection. The busyness of our lives , our rel ent less inter ests , conc e rns, hop es, fru strations, a nd fears t ake preced ence, a nd on a day - to - day basis we are unaware of being linked to everything el se. Don Juan had stat ed his beli ef that the Chri stian idea of bein g cast out fro m the Garden of Eden sounded to him li ke an a ll egory for losing our si lent knowledge, our knowledge of intent.

He emphasized that intent is not somethin g one might use or command or m ove in a ny way — nevertheless, one could use it, c ommand it, or move it as one desires.

Don Juan immediately pointed out that this was a cynical opinion, not a cynical explanation, because it did not exp lai n the fact that my frie nd had really gotten wel l. Don Juan had then pro pos ed an alte rnati ve view based on sorcer e rs ' knowledge. He had explained that the event hin ged on the salient fact that the healer was c apabl e of moving the ass emblage poi nt of the exa ct number of people in her audience. The onl y tric kery involved — if one could call it trickery — was that the number of peopl e present in the roo m c ould not exceed the number she could handl e. Her dramatic trance and the accompanying hi strion ics were , accor ding to him, either well - thought - out devices the healer used to tra p t he attention of those pres ent or unconscious maneuvers dic tated by the sp ir it itself. Whichev er, they were the most appropriate means whereby the healer could foster the unity of th oug ht needed to remove doubt fro m the minds of those present and force them into heightened awareness . When s he cut the body open with a kitchen kn ife and removed the internal orga ns it was not, don Juan h ad s tresse d, sleight of hand. These were bona fide even ts, which, by virtue of tak ing place in heightened awareness, were outside the r ea lm of ev eryday judgment. I had aske d don Juan how the healer c ould manage to move the a ss emblage poi nts of those peopl e without touching them. His repl y had bee n that the he aler' s power, a gift or a stupendous accomplishment, w as to s erve as a condui t for t he s pir it. It was the s pir it, he had s aid, an d not t he healer , which had moved those asse mblage po ints . \"I explain ed t o you then, although you didn't understand a wo rd of it,\" don Juan went on, \"that the healer 's art and power was to remove doubts fro m the m ind s of those present. By doing this, she was able to all ow the spiri t to move their assemblage poi nts. Once those poi nts had moved, everything was possible. Th ey had en tered into the realm where miracles are commonplace.\" "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"He ass erted emphatical ly that the healer must als o have been a sorcer ess , and that if I made an effor t to remember the oper ation, I woul d remem ber that she had been ruthless with the people arou nd her, especially the patient. I repeated to him what I coul d recall of the ses sion. The pitch and tone of the healer 's flat, femin ine voice changed dramatic a ll y when she e ntered a tra nce into a raspy, deep, male vo ice. That voice annou nced that the sp ir it of a warrior of pre - Co lumbian a ntiquity had pos ses sed the healer 's b ody. Once the announcement was made, the healer's attitude changed dramatica ll y. She was possessed . She was obvio usly absolu tely sure of herself, and she pro ceeded to oper ate with total cer tai nty an d firmn ess . \"I pref er the word ' ruthl ess ness' to 'certain ty' and ' firmness,'\" don Juan commented, then conti nued. \"That healer had to be ruthless to create the pro per sett ing for the spiri t's inter vention.\" He ass erted that events dif ficult to expl ain, such as that oper ation, were really very simple.

It was muddl ed thinki ng that did not really answer his needs and left great murki ness in his head. The other was preci se thinki ng.

He tried to put me at ease, explain ing that my instability was caused by a slight flu ctuation of my assemblage poi nt, which had not stabili zed in the new positi on it had reached some years earli e r. The fluctuation was the result of leftover feeli ngs of self - pity. \"What new posit io n is t hat, don Juan?\" I aske d. \"Years ag o — a nd th is is what I want you to recollect — your ass emblage po int rea ched the place of no pity,\" he replied. \"I beg your pard on?\" I said. \"The place of no pity is the site of ruthl ess ness,\" he said. \"But you know all this.

Don Juan had explain ed that what I felt and inter preted as longing was in fact the sudden movement of my assemblage poi nt.

I coul d not conc eive how my eyes coul d store that sort of inf ormation, and I said as much. Don Juan's reply was that man's possibi li ties are so va st and mys terio us that sorcer ers, rather tha n thinking a bou t them, had c hosen to exp lo re them, with no hop e of ever understanding them. I ask ed hi m if an average man's eyes were also af fe cted by i ntent. \"Of cour se!\" he exclaimed. \"You know all th is. But you know it at such a deep level that it is s il ent knowledge.

The more I thought about my predicament, the sorri e r I felt for mys elf. Don Juan was finished. I had a terrible sense of l oss, of doom.

Don Juan adm itted that he might have ma de a mistake, that the store might be in a different town. By then I was compl etely exhausted and had no idea what to do next. In my nor ma l state of awareness I always had the strange feelin g that I knew more about him than my reason told me. Now, under t he pressure of his mental deterioration, I was certain , without knowin g why, that hi s fri e nds were wai t ing for him somewhere in Mexico, although I did not know where. My exhaustion was more than physical. It was a combi nat io n of wo rr y and guilt. It worr ie d me that I was stuck w ith a feeble ol d man who might, for al l I knew, be mortal ly i ll .

He turned around and led me to the main square: a dusty plaza withou t even benches. Don Juan sat down on the curb.

Sudden ly he stood up and walked away fro m me. I noti ced how frail he looked. He had aged in a matter of hou rs. His natural vigor was gone, and what I saw befor e me was a ter ri bly old, weak man. I rushed to lend him a hand. A wave of immense pity enveloped me. I saw myself ol d and weak, barel y able to walk. It was into ler able. I was clo se to wee pin g, not for don Juan but for mys elf. I held his arm and made him a silent promise that I would lo ok after him, no matter what. I was lo st in a reverie of self - pity when I felt the numbi ng force of a slap acro ss my face.

The idea that months would go by befor e s omeone noticed my disappearance made me react with vicio us speed. I kicked the fir st young man who came clo se to me, then took off at a pani cked run .

It was not hatr ed I felt, or even anger: I was not even annoyed with him. What I felt was not resignation or patience, either. And it was certainly not kindness . Rather it was a c ol d indifference, a frightening lack of pity. At that instant, I could not have cared less a bou t what happened to don Juan or myself. Don Juan s hoo k his upper bod y the w ay a dog sha kes it self dry after a sw im. And then, as if all of it had onl y been a bad dream, he was again the ma n I knew.

I had no clear idea where I was going, yet s omethin g i n me knew. I let that part take over. Very late in the evening we arr ived at the big ho use don Juan's group of sorcer e rs had in a rural area of the stat e of Sinal oa in northwes tern Mex ico . The journ ey seemed to have t a ken no time at all . I could not remem ber the particulars of our dri ve. All I knew about it was that we had not talked. The house s eemed t o be empty. There w ere no s ig ns of people li ving t he re. I k new, however, that don Juan's fri en ds were in the hou se. I coul d fe el their presence withou t act ually having to see them. Don Juan li t some kerosene lanterns and we sat down at a sturdy table. It seemed that don Juan was getting ready to eat. I was wonder ing what to say or do when a woman entered noiseless ly and put a large plate of food on the tabl e. I was not prep ared for her entrance, and whe n she stepped out of the darkness into the light, as if she had materialized out of nowhere, I gas ped invol untari ly. \"Don't be scared, it's me, Carmela,\" she said and disappeared, swallo wed agai n by the darkn ess .

I half expected them to come, but no one app ea red. I tried to eat, but I was not hungry. I began to th ink about the woma n. I did not know her. That is, I could almost iden tify her, but I coul d not quite work my memory of her out of the fog that obscur ed my thoughts. I strugg led to clear my mind . I felt that it requ ired too m uch energy and I gav e up. Almost as soon as I had st opp ed th inking about her, I began to expe ri ence a strange, numbing anxiety. At fir st I beli eved that the dark, mass iv e hou se, and the silence in and around it, were depr ess ing. But then my anguish rose to incredible proportions, right after I heard the fai nt barki ng of dogs in the distance. For a moment I th ought that my bod y was going to explod e. Don Juan inter vened quick ly. He jumped to where I was sitting and pushed my back until it cracked. The p ressure on my back brought me immediate re li ef. When I ha d calmed down, I reali zed I had lost , together with the anxiet y that had nearl y consumed me, the clear sense of knowin g everythi ng. I coul d no lo nger anticipate how don Juan was g oi ng to ar ticulate what I mys elf knew. Don Juan then started a most pecul iar explanation. Fir st he s aid that the ori gin of the anxiety that had overtaken me with the speed of wildfire was the sudden movement of my ass emblage poi nt , caused by Carmela's sudden a ppearan ce , and by my unavoi dable effort to m ove my ass emblage poi nt t o t he place wher e I would be ab le to id ent ify her co m pletely. He advised me to get used to the idea of recur rent attacks of the same type of anxiety, because my ass emblage po int was goin g to keep moving. \"Any movement of the assemblage poi nt is li ke dying,\" he said. \"Everything in us gets discon nected, then reconnected again to a so urce of much greater power. That amplification of energy is fel t as a killing anxiety.\""},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" \"What am I to do when this happen s?\" I a sked. \"Nothi ng,\" he said. \"Just wait. The outbu rst of energy will pass. What's dangerou s is not know ing what is happening to yo u. Once yo u know , there i s no real danger.\" Then he ta lked about anci e nt man. He said t hat anci ent man knew, in the m ost dir ect fashio n, what to do and how best to do it. But, be ca use he performed so wel l, he started to develop a sense of selfness, which gav e him the feeli ng th at he coul d predict and plan the actions he was used to perf orming. And thus the idea of an individ ual \"self appeared; an individ ual self which began to d ic tate the nature and scope of man's act io ns. As the feeli ng of the indiv idu al self became str ong er, man lo st his natural connection to si lent knowledge. Modern man , be ing he ir to that developmen t, therefore finds himse lf so hop e lessly removed fro m the sou r ce of everything that all he can do is express his despair in violent and cynical acts of sel f - destruction. Don Juan ass erted that the reason for man's cynicism and despair is t he b it of s il e nt k nowl e dge left in him, wh ich does t wo t hin gs : o ne, it g ives ma n an i nkling of his anci ent conn ect io n to the source of everything; and two, it makes man feel that withou t this conn ection, he has no hope of peace , of satisfaction, of attainme nt. I thought I had caught don Juan in a contradiction. I poi nted out to him that he had once to ld me that war was the natur al st ate for a warrior, that peace was an an omaly. \"That's ri ght,\" he admitted. \"But war, for a warrior , doesn't mean acts of ind ivid ual or collective stupidi ty or wanton vi ol ence. War, for a warrior, is the total strugg le against that individ ual self that has depr ived man of h is po wer.\" Don Juan said then that it was time for us to t alk fur the r about ruthlessnes s — the most basic premi se of sorcer y. He explain ed that sorcer ers had discovered that any movement of the ass emblage poi nt meant a movement away fro m the excessive conc ern with that individual self which w as the m ark of mode rn man. He w ent on to s ay that sorcer ers believed it was the position of the ass emblage poi nt which made moder n m an a homi cid a l ego tist, a bein g totally invol ved with his self - image. Having lo st hope of ever return ing to the sou rce of everything, man sought"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"solace in his selfness. And, in doing so, he succeeded in fixing his ass emblage poi nt in the exact positi on to perpetuate his sel f - image. It was th erefo re safe to say that any movement of the ass emblage po int away from its customary position resulted in a m ovement away from ma n's self - refl ection and its concomitant: self - importance. Don Juan described self - importance as the for c e g enerated by man's self - image. He rei terated that it is that for ce which keeps the a ss emblage poi nt fixed where it is at present. For this reason, the thrust of the wa rrior s' way is to dethrone self - importance. And everything sorcerers do is toward accompli shing this goal. He explain ed th at sorcer ers had unmasked self - impo rtance and fou nd that it is se lf - pity masquerading as something else. \"It doesn't sound possible, but that is what it is ,\" he said. \"Self - pity is the real enemy and the source of man's m is ery. Wi th out a degree of pity for himse lf, man could not affo rd to be as sel f - impo rtant as he is. Howe ver, once the for ce of self - importance is engage d, it develops its own momentum. And it is th is seemingly ind ependent nature of self - importance which give s it its fake sense of wor th.\" His explanation, which I wo uld have foun d inc omprehensible under normal conditions, seemed thoro ugh ly cogent to me. But because of the dual ity in me, which still pertain e d, it appeared a bit simpli stic. Don J uan seemed to ha ve aimed his t hou ghts and words at a specific target. And I, in my nor mal st ate of awar eness , was that target. He conti nued his explanation, say ing that sorcer ers are absolu tely convinced that by moving our ass emblage poi nts away fro m their customary pos i tion we ac hieve a stat e of being which could onl y be ca ll ed ruthl ess ness. Sorc erers knew, by means of their practica l actions, that as soon as their ass emblage poi nts move, their self - impo rtance cru mbles. Wi thout the customary positi on of their as semblage poi nts, t heir s elf - image can no longer be sust ained . And without the heav y focu s on that self - image, they lose their self - compassion, and with it their self - importance. Sorcerers are ri ght, therefore, in saying that, self - importance is merely self - pity in disguise. He then took my experienc e of the afternoon and went through it step by step. He stat ed that a nagual in his rol e as leader or teache r has to be have in the most efficient, but at the same time"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"most impecc able, way. Sinc e it is not possible for h im to plan the course of his actions rationally, the nag ual always lets the s pir it dec ide his course.

I was frankly taken by the chan ge in her . In fact, I overlooked h er b ad manners because of it. \"That was the omen, \" don Jua n said. \"Hard ness and transfor mati on were the indication of the spiri t.\" He said that his first act of the day, as a nagual, was to let me know his intenti ons.

He said that he had wanted to c larify this point, because, if it was misunder stood, it led a nagual back to self - importance an d thus to his d estructio n. He changed the subject and said that, because the spiri t had no perceivable ess ence, sor cerer s deal rather with the specific instances and ways in wh ich they a re able to shatte r the mirror of self - refl e ction . Don Juan noted that in th is area it was impo rta nt to reali ze the practica l value of the different ways in w hic h the naguals mas ked t he ir ruthlessn ess .

He knew that nagual meant sorcer er, yet he was unabl e to take in the total implic at io n of the nag ual Juli an's words.

The fear of falling prey to that monstrous man was indeed a po werful psychological force. Don Juan told me that by some qui rk in his own nature he was boo rish only wit h the women; he never behaved badl y in the presence of the nagual Julian. For some reason that don Juan could not determin e, in his mind the nagual was not someone he coul d attempt to affect either consci ous ly or subco nsc io usly. The other member of the ho usehold , the unsoci able man , was of no c onsequenc e to don Juan. Don Juan had formed an opinion the moment he met him, and had discounted him. He thoug ht that the m an was w eak, indolent, an d overp owered by t hose beautiful w omen. Lat er on, w hen he was more a ware of the nagual's pe rsonality, he k new that the man was defi nitel y overshadowed by the gli tter of the others. As time passed, the nature of leader sh ip and a uthority among them became evident to don Juan. He was surpr ised and somehow delighted to realiz e that no one was better or higher than another . Some of them pe rformed functions of which the others were inc apable, but that did not make them superi or. It simply made them dif ferent. However, the ulti mate decisi on in everything was automatical ly the nag ual Julian's, and he a ppar ently to ok great pleasure in expressing his decisi ons in the form of bestial jokes he p layed on everyone. Ther e was also a mys tery woman among them. T hey refer red to her as Talia, the nagual woman. Nob ody told do n Juan w ho she wa s, or what being t he nagual w oman meant.

She said that he must learn to write things down rather than committing them to memor y. In this fashi on he w o uld accumu late a huge col lection of fact s about Talia, facts that he oug ht to read and study until the truth became evident. Perhaps anticipating the cy nic a l retort he had in mind , she argued that, although it m ight s eem an absurd endeavor, finding out wh o Talia was was one of the m ost dif ficu lt and rewarding task s anyone co uld unde rtake. That, she said, was the fun part. She added more seriou sly that it was imper ative for don Juan to learn bas ic bookkeeping in order to help the nagual manage the proper ty . Immediately she started dail y lessons and in one year don Juan had pro gress ed so rapidl y and extens ively that he was able to read, wri te , an d kee p acco unt bo oks. Everything had occu rred so smoothly that he di d not noti ce the changes in himself , the mos t remarkabl e of which was a sense of detachmen t. As far as he was conc erned, he retained his impr ess io n that nothing was happen ing in the hou se, simply because he still was unabl e to iden tify with the members of the hou sehold. Tho se peopl e were mirror s tha t did not yield refl ection. \"I took refu ge in that house for nea rl y three years,\" don Juan went on. \"Countless things happen ed to me dur ing that time, but I did n't think they wer e reall y impo rtant.

An i ncr e dib le su rge of energy made him adv ance with no conc ern for his safety . A feeli ng of total detachment all owed him to face the monster that had terro ri zed him for so many years.

F rom a d istance of a few in ches he s tared at the m onstrou s man for an inst ant and then stepped over the li ne.

Don Juan adv anced toward the fog and it receded as if in fear. He chase d the patch of fog over the fiel ds until he knew there was nothi ng left of the monster.

He had the vag ue sensat io n that althou gh he knew exactly what the m onster wa s, something was preventin g him fro m thinking about it. He immedi ately thought that that rasca l, the nagual Julian, knew the truth about what was happeni ng. Don Juan would not have put it pas t the nagual Julian to pl ay that ki nd of trick. Befor e confronting him, don Juan gav e himself th e pleasur e of walking unescor ted all over the pro pe rty. Never before had he been able to do th at. When ever he had needed to v enture be yond that invi sible line, he had been escorted by a member of the hou seho ld. That had put a seriou s constrai nt on his mobility.

In oth er wo rds, instead of perceiving the normal here and there, I had p erceived \"here and here.\" His comments frightened me. He was ri ght. I had not ment io ned that to him, nor had I admitted even to m yse lf that I had been in two plac es at once. I woul d not hav e dared to think in those terms had i t not been for his comments . He repeated that I needed more time and more energy to make sense of ever ything. I was too new; I stil l required a great deal of supervisio n. F or instance, while I was lo omin g over the shru bs, he had to make his assemblage poi nt flu ctuate rapidl y between the plac es of reason and silent knowledge to take care of me. And that had exhaus ted hi m. \"Tell me one th ing,\" I s aid, te sting his reasonabl e ness. \"That jaguar w as stranger than y ou want to admit, wasn't it? Jaguars are not part of the fauna of this area. Pumas, yes , but not jaguars. How do you explain that?\" Befor e a nswering, he puc kered his face. He was suddenl y very serious. \"I think that this parti cul a r jaguar confirms your anthro polog ical theories,\" he said in a solemn tone. \"Obvio usly, the jaguar was follo wing this fam ous trade rou te c onn ect ing Chihuahua w ith Central Amer ica.\" Don Juan laughed so hard that the sound of his laughter echoed in the mountai ns. That echo disturb ed me as m uch as the jaguar had. Yet it was not the echo itself which d isturbed me, but the fact that I had never heard an echo at night. Echoes were, in my mind, ass oci ated only with the daytime."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" It had taken me several hours to recall all the deta il s of my exper i ence with the jaguar. During that time, don Juan had not talked to me. He had simply propped himself against a roc k and gone to sleep in a sitting position. After a wh il e I no lon ger noti ced that he was there, a nd fin a ll y I fell asleep. I was awakened by a pain in my jaw. I had been sleepin g with the side of my face pressed against a ro ck. The moment I opened my eyes , I tr ied to slide down off the bou lder on which I had been lyin g, but lo st my balan ce and fe ll noisi ly on my seat . Don Ju an appeared from beh ind some bu shes just in t ime to laugh. It was getting late and I wonder ed aloud if we had enough time to get to the valley before nightfal l. Don Juan shrugged h is shoulder s and did not seem con ce rned . He sat d own b eside me. I aske d him if he wanted to he ar the detail s of my reco ll ection. He indicated that it was fin e with him, yet he did not ask me any questions. I thou ght he was lea ving it up to me to start, so I told him there were three poi nts I remembered which were of great impo rtance to me. One was that he had talked about silent knowledge; another w as that I had moved my ass emblage poi nt using intent; and the final point was that I had entered into heightened awareness withou t requiring a blo w between my shoulder blades . \"Intending the movement of your ass emblage point was y our g reate st accompl ishment,\" don Juan said. \"But accompl ishment is something personal . It's necessary, but it's not the impo rtant part. It is no t the res idu e so rcer ers look forward to.\" I thought I knew what he wanted. I told h im tha t I hadn't tota ll y forgotten the event. What had remain ed with me in my nor ma l stat e of awarene ss was that a mountai n lion — since I c ould not accept the idea of a jaguar — had chased us up a mountai n, and that don Juan had aske d me if I had felt offende d by the big cat's onslau ght. I had ass ured him that it was absurd that I coul d feel off ended, and he had told me I should f ee l the sa me way about the ons laughts of my fe llow men. I shoul d protect myself, or get out of their way, but withou t fee li ng m orall y wronged."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" \"That is not the res idue I am talking about,\" he sa id, laughing. \"The idea of the a bstract, the s pirit, is the onl y residu e that is important.

You have always beli eved that I m eant to think abstractly. No. To abstract means to make your self available to the s pirit b y being aware of it.\" He said that one of the m ost dramatic things about the human cond ition was the macabre conn ection between stupidity and se lf - refl ection. It was stupi dity that forced us to discard anything that did not c onform with our self - reflective expectations. For example, as average men, we w ere blind to t he most crucial piece of kn owledge availabl e to a human be ing: the existence of the a ss emblage po int an d the fact that it co uld move . \"For a rational man it's unthi nkable that there should be an invisible poi nt where percep tion is ass emble d,\" he went on. \"A nd yet more unthink able, that suc h a point is not in the brain, as he might vaguely expect if he were given t o enter taining the thou ght of its existence. \" He added that for the rational man t o hold stea dfastly to his self - image insured h is abysmal ignor ance. He ignored, for inst ance, the fact that sorcer y was not inc antati ons and hocus - pocus, but the freedo m to pe rcei ve not only the world taken for granted, but everything else that was humanl y pos sible. \"Here is whe re the average man's s tupidity is most dangerou s,\" he c onti nued. \"He is afraid of sorcer y. He trembles at the possibi li ty of freedo m. And freedo m is at his fin gerti ps. It's call ed the thir d po int. And it can be reached as easily as the as semblage poi nt can be made to move .\" \"B ut you yourse lf told me that moving the as semblage poi nt is so difficu lt that it is a true accomplishment, \" I proteste d. "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"\"It is,\" he a ss ured me. \"Thi s is another of the sorcer ers' contr adictions: it's very dif fic ult and yet it's the simplest thing in the wo rl d. I've told y ou already that a high fever could move the ass emblage poi nt. Hunger or fear or lo ve or hate coul d do it; mys tici sm too, and also unbending intent, which is the preferred method of sorcerers. \" I asked him to explain again what unben din g intent was. He said that it was a sort of single - mind edness human bein gs ex hibit; an ex tremely well - defined purpose not c oun termanded by a ny conf licting inter ests or desires; unben ding intent was also the for ce engendered when the ass emblage po int was main tained fixed in a positi on which was not the usual one. Don Juan then ma de a meaningful dist inc tion — which had eluded me all these years — between a movement and a shift of the a ss emblage poi nt. A movement, he said, was a pro fou nd change of positi on, so ext reme that the assemblage poi nt might even reach other bands of ene rgy within our total luminous mass of energy fiel ds. Each band of e nergy repr esented a completely different uni verse to be pe rcei ved. A shift, however, was a small movement within the band o f energy fiel ds we perceived as the world of eve ryday li fe. He went on to say that sorcer ers saw unben din g intent as the catalyst to trigger their unch angeable decisions, or as the converse: the ir unchangeable decisi ons were the catalyst that pro pe ll ed th eir ass emblage points to new positions , positions wh ich in turn generated unbend ing intent. I must have lo oked dumbf ounded. Don Juan laughed and said that trying to reason out the sorcer ers' metaph orical descrip t io ns was as usele ss as trying to reason out si lent knowledge. He added that the p roblem with w ords was that any attempt to clari fy the s orcerers' descrip t io n onl y made them mor e confus ing. I urged him to try to clarify th is in any way he could. I argued that anything he c ould say , for instance, ab out the thir d poi nt coul d onl y clarify it, for although I knew e verything about it, it was still very confusing. "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"\"The world of daily li fe c onsists of two points of reference,\" he said. \" We have for example , here and there, in and out, up a nd down, good an d evi l, and so on a nd so forth. So, properly speaking, our percep tion of our lives is two - dimen si onal . Non e of what we perceive ourselves doi ng has depth.\" I pro test ed that he was mixin g levels. I told him t hat I could accept his definition of percep t io n as the capaci ty of li ving bein gs to a ppr ehe nd with their sense s fiel ds of ene rgy selected by their ass emblage poi nts — a very farfetched definition by my academic standa rds, but one that, at the moment, seeme d cogent. Howev er, I could not im agine what t he d epth of w hat w e did might be. I argued that it was pos sible he was talking ab out inter pretations — elaborations of our basic percep tions. \"A sorcer er percei ves his action s with depth, \" he said. \"His ac tion s are tri - dimen si onal for him. They have a third poi nt of reference. \" \"How co uld a thi rd point of reference exist ?\" I asked with a ting e of a nno yance. \"Our points of refer en ce are obtain ed prima rily from our sense percep tion,\" he said. \"Our sense s percei ve and diffe renti ate what is immedi ate to us fro m wh at is not. Using that basic distinc t io n we deri ve the rest. \"In or de r to reach the third point of reference one must per ceive two places at onc e.\" My reco ll ecting had put me in a strange mood — it was as if I had li ved the experienc e just a few minu tes ear li e r. I was suddenl y aware of something I had compl etely missed before. Under don Juan's supervisio n, I had twice before experience d that divi ded percep tion, but this was the fir st time I had accomplished it all by myse lf. Thi nk ing about my recollectio n, I a lso reali zed that my sensory experi ence was more c ompl ex than I had at fir st thought. Duri ng the time I had loom ed over the bushes, I had been aware — without"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"words or even thoughts — that bein g in two places, or bein g \"here and here\" as don Juan had call ed it, rend e red my percep tion immedi ate a nd complete at both places. But I had also been aware that my dou ble perception lacked the total clari ty o f normal per ce ptio n. Don Juan exp lai ned that normal percep t io n had a n axis. \"Here and there\" were the perimete rs of that axis, and we were parti al to the clarity of \" here.\" He said that in norma l perception, only \"here\" was percei ved compl etely, instantaneously, and dir ectly. Its twin refer ent, \"there,\" lacked immedi acy. It was inf erred, deduced, expected, even as sumed, but it was not appr ehended dir ectly with all the sense s. When we percei ved two plac es at once, total clar ity was lo st, but the immedi ate perception of \"there\" was gained. \"But then, don Jua n, I was ri ght in describing my percep tion as the impo rtant part of my experienc e,\" I sa id. \"No, you were not,\" he said. \"What you exper ienced was vital to you, because it opened the road to silent knowledge, but the important thing was the jaguar. That jaguar was ind eed a manif esta tion of the spirit. \"That big cat came unnoticed out of nowher e. And he c ould have finished us off as surely as I am talking to you. That jaguar was an expressio n of magic. Wi thout him you would have had no elatio n, no lesson, no realizations.\" \"But was he a r eal jag uar?\" I asked. \"Y ou bet he was real!\" Don Juan observed that for an average man that big cat woul d have been a fri ghtening odd ity. An average man woul d have been hard put to explain in reasonable terms what that jaguar was doing in Chihu a hua, so far fro m a tropical jungle . But a sorcer er, because he had a conn ecting li nk with intent, saw that jaguar as a vehicle to perceiving — not an odd ity, b ut a source o f awe ."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" Ther e w ere a lo t of questions I w anted t o ask, and y et I knew the answer s befor e I could artic ulate the question s. I followed the c our se of my own questions and answers for a wh il e , until finall y I reali zed it did not matter that I silentl y knew the answers; answers had to be verba li zed to be of any value. I voiced the fir st question that came to mind. I aske d don Juan to explain what seemed to be a contr adiction. He had asserted that onl y the spirit coul d move the a ss emblage poi nt. But then he had said that my feelings, processed into intent, had moved my assemblage poi nt. \"Onl y sorcer e rs can turn the ir feelings i nto intent,\" he said. \"Intent is the spirit, so it is the spiri t which moves their ass emblage po ints. \"The misleading part of a ll th is,\" he went on, \"is that I am say ing onl y sorcer ers kn ow about the spiri t, that intent is the exclusive domain of sorcerer s.

The real c ondition is that sorcer ers a re './ore aware of their conn ection w ith the spirit t han the average man a nd st ri ve to manipulate it. That's a ll . I've already told you, the connect ing lin k with intent is the uni versal feature shared by everyt hin g there is. \" Two or th ree times, don Juan seemed about to start to add something. He vacillated , apparently trying to choo se his words.

Spli t percep tion, if accomplished by one's own means, was call e d the free movement of the ass emblage po int. He ass ured me that every nagua l consistently did everything within his power to encou rage the free movement of his appr entices' ass emblage poi nts. Thi s all - out effort was cryptic all y call ed \"reachi ng out for the thir d poin t.\" "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"\"The most difficu lt aspect of the nagual's kn owledge,\" don Juan went on, \"and ce rtain ly the most cru cial part of his task is that of reachi ng out for the thir d point — the nagual intends that free movement, and t he s pir it cha nnel s to t he nagual t he means t o accompl ish it. I had never intend e d anything of that sort u ntil you came along. Ther efore, I had never fully appreciated my benefactor 's gigantic effo rt to intend it f or me. \"Diffi c ult as it is for a nagual to intend that free movement for his disciples,\" don Juan went on, \"it's nothi ng compared with the difficul ty his disciples have in understanding what the nagual is doi ng. Look at the w ay you yourself strugg le! The same thing happened t o me. M ost of the time , I ended up believing the trickery of the spirit was si mply the trickery of the nagual Julian. \"Later o n, I reali zed I owed him my li fe and well - bein g,\" don Juan continued. \"Now I know I owe him infinitely more. Since I can't beg in to des cribe what I reall y owe him, I prefer to say he cajol ed me in to having a third point of reference. \"The third point of r efe rence is fr eed om o f percep tion ; it is intent; it is the spirit; the somersault of thought into the mir aculous; the act of reachi ng beyond our bou ndaries and touching the inc onceivable.\" THE TW O ONE - WAY BRIDGES Don Juan and I were sitting at the table in his kitchen. It was early morn ing. We had just return ed fro m the mountains, where we had spent the night after I had recalled my experience with the jaguar. Recol lectin g my split percep tion had put me in a state of eupho ria, which don Juan had emplo yed , as usual, to plu nge me into more sensor y experienc es that I was now unabl e to recal l. My euphoria, howev er, had not waned. \"To discover the possibili ty of being in two plac e s at once is very exciting to the mind ,\" he said. \"Sinc e o ur m ind s are our rat io nality, an d o ur rationali ty is o ur sel f - reflection, anything beyon d ou r self - refl e ction either appalls u s or attracts us, dep endi ng on what kind of persons we are.\""},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" He l ooked at me fixedly and then smiled as if he had just fou nd o ut something n ew. \"Or it appalls and attracts us in the same measur e,\" he said, \"which seems to be the case with both of us.\" I told him that w ith me it was not a matter of be ing appalled or attracted by my exper ience, but a matter of be ing f rightened by the immensity of the pos sibility o f s pli t percep t io n. \"I can't say that I don 't beli eve I was in two places at once, \" I said. \"I can't deny my experience, and yet I thin k I am so frightened by it that my mi nd r ef uses to accept i t as a fact.\" \"You and I are the type of pe opl e wh o become obsess ed by things li ke that, and then for get all about them,\" he remarked and laughed. \"You and I are very mu ch alike.\" It was my turn to laugh.

That new c ontinui ty is always too tenuous, too unstable, and does not off er sorcerers the ass ured ness they ne ed to function as if they were in the world of everyday lif e. \"How d o sorcerers resolve this problem?\" I asked. \"Non e of us resolves anything,\" he replied. \"The spiri t either resolves it for us or it doesn't. If it does, a sorcer e r finds himself acting in the so rcerers' worl d, but without knowing how. Thi s is the r eason why I have insist ed fro m the day I fou nd you that impecc ability is all that counts. A sorcer er lives an impeccable life, and that seems to b eckon the solution. Why? No one knows. \" Don Juan remained quiet for a mome nt. And then, as if I had voiced it , he c ommented on a thought I was having. I was thin king that i mpeccability always made me thi nk of religious morality. \"Impeccability, as I have to ld yo u so ma ny time s, is not morality,\" he sai d. \"It only resembles morality. Impeccability is simply the best use of our energy level. Natural ly, it call s for fru gal ity, thoughtful ness, sim plici ty, innocence; and abov e all, it calls for lack of self - reflection.

The real diffic ulty is having energy. If one has energy, once the ass emblage po int mo ves , i nconce ivable th ings are there for the asking.\" Don Juan explained that man's predicament is t hat he intuits his hidden resour ces, but he does not dare use them.

He simply c ould not back out. He announced that he was as ready as he could ever be. The nagua l guided him to the edge of the raging river and made him kneel. The nagual began a long inc a ntation in wh ich he invoked the power of the wind and the mountains and asked the p ower of the river to advise don Ju an.

He was fri ghtened at the t hou ght that he migh t never be normal ag ain. But as he ex plo red h is s pli t perception, he discovered its practi ca l side and found he li ked it.

In a fervent tone he explained to don Juan that his benefactor was a sup reme stalker, a lways after practi ca li ties. His endl ess quest was for pragmatic views and soluti ons. His behavior that day at the ri ver had been a maste rpiece of stalking. He h ad manipul a ted and a ffected everyon e. Even the ri ver seemed to be at his command. The nagual Elías maintai ned that whil e don Juan was bein g carr ied by the cur rent, fightin g for his li fe , the ri ver help ed him understand what the sp ir it was. And thanks to that underst anding, don Juan had the opportunity to enter directly into si lent knowledge. Don Juan sai d that because he was a call ow yo uth he li stened to the nagual Elías withou t understand ing a word, but was moved with sin cere admiration for the nagual's intensity.

The n agual told don Juan that his accomp li shment was magnific ent. He even hugged don Juan as if he were a child. And he could not stop talking about how don J uan, in sp ite of not knowin g anything — or maybe becaus e of not k nowi ng a nything — had transferred h is t otal e nergy fro m one plac e to the other.

Don Juan listened, mesmerized by the s oun d of the ol d nagual's voice.

Don Juan aske d the ol d nagual what exactly the nagual Ju li an was doing to him. His question sounded more mature and intelli gent than what he really meant. The nagua l Elías answered it in terms totally unintelligible to don J uan at that time . He said that the nagual Julian was coaching don J uan, enticing his ass emblage poi nt t o the po sition of reason, so he could be a th inker rather than merely part of an unsophisticated but em otio nally charged audi e nce that lo ved the ord e rl y works of reason.

He said that only those who were squarel y in either position could see the other positi on c learly, and that that had been the way the age of reason came to bein g. The positi on of reason was clear ly seen fro m the positi on of silent knowledge. The ol d nag ual told don Juan that the one - way bridge fro m silent know ledge to reason was call ed \"conc ern.\" That is, the concern that true men of silent knowledge had about the source of what they knew.

He pran ced and fro li cked with aban don and entertained everybody, especia ll y the power he was address ing. Don Juan said that the nagual Elías ass ured him that the spiri t onl y listened when the speaker speaks in gestures. And gestures do not mean signs or bod y movements, but acts of true abando n, acts of larges se, of humor .

He pic ked a thought r ight out of my mind; or perhaps it was I who picked that thought out of his. \"If you think about life in terms of hours instead of years, our lives are immensely lo ng,\" he said. \"Even i f you th ink in terms of days, life is st il l interminabl e.\" That was exactly what I had b een thinking."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" He told me that sorcer ers coun ted their lives in hou rs, and that in one hour it was possibl e for a sorcer er to live the equi valent in intensity of a normal life.

I opened my mouth two or three times to ask him questions, but could not formulate my thoughts. \"Because his intensity rate is greater than normal,\" don Juan said, \"in a few hours a sorcerer can li ve the equivalent of a normal li fetime.

So, prope rly speaking, every sorc erer's every action is deliberate in th ought and reali zation, and has the specific blend of the four foundations of stalking. \"Sorc erers use the fou r m ood s of stalki ng as gui des,\" he c onti nued. \"These are four different frames of m ind, four different brands of intensity that sorcer ers can use to ind uce their ass emblage po ints to mo ve to specific positions.\" He seemed suddenl y annoyed.

Or, perh aps it was because his personality — which he sai d was basically devio us and petty — simply did not have the agi li ty needed to practice controlled folly. I loo ked at him with surprise.

The awareness of everyday li fe was li ke bein g sealed in one roo m of that immense hou se for li fe. We entered the roo m th rough a magical opening: birth. And we exited through another such magical opening: death. Sorc erers, however, were capabl e of findin g still another opening and could leave that sealed roo m while still alive. A superb attainment. But t heir astounding accomplishment was that when they escaped fro m that sealed room they chose freedo m. They chose to leave that immense, haunted house entirely instead of gett ing l ost in ot her parts of it. Morbid ity was the antithesis of the surge of energy awareness needed to reach freedo m. Morbidi ty made sorcer ers lose their way and become trapped in the intr icate, dark byways of the unkno wn. I ask ed do n Juan if there was any morbidity in the Tulio s.

Don Juan peered at me and laughed lo udly. At that instant the li ghts of the plaza wer e turned on. He got up from his favo ri te bench and rubbed it w ith the palm of h is hand, as if it were a pet. \"Freedo m,\" he said. \"He wanted the ir freedo m from percep tua l c onventio n. And he taught them to be a rtists. Stalking is an a rt . For a so rcer er, si nce he's not a pat ron or a sel ler of art, the only thing o f importance about a work of art is that it can be accomplished.\" We st ood by the bench , watchi ng the e vening s trol lers milling around. The s tory of t he fou r Tulio s had left me with a sense of for eboding. Don Juan suggest ed that I return home; the lo ng dri ve to L.A. , he s aid, w oul d g ive my assemblage poin t a res pite from all t he moving it had done in t he past few days. \"The nagual's compan y is very tiri ng,\" he went on. \"It pro du ces a strange fatigue; it coul d even be inju rious.\" I ass ured him t hat I w as not tired at a ll, and that his compan y was anything but injuri ous t o me. I n fact, his company affected me li ke a narcotic — I couldn't do without it. This sounded as if I were flat terin g h im, but I rea ll y meant what I said. We strolled around the plaza three or four times in complete sil ence. \"Go home and th ink about the basic c ores of th e sorcer y stor ies,\" don J uan said with a note of fin ality in his voice. \"Or rather, don't thin k abou t them, but make your ass emblage poi nt move toward the plac e of silent knowledge. Moving th e assemblage poi nt is everything, but it means"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"nothi ng if it's not a sober, c ontroll e d movement. So, clo se the door of self - reflection .
