[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Journey to Ixtlan Carlos Castan eda INTRODUCTION On Saturday , May 22, 1971, I went to Sonora, Mexico, to see don Juan Matus, a Yaqu i Indian sorcerer, with whom I had been associated since 1961 . I thought that my visit on that day was going to be in no way different from the scores of times I had gone to see him in the ten years I had been his ap prentice. The events that took place on that day an d on the following day s, however, were momentous to me. On that occasion my ap prenticeship cam e to an end. This w as not an arbitrary withdrawal on my part but a bona fide termination. I hav e alread y presented the case of my ap prenticeship in two previous works: The Teachings of Don Juan an d A Separate Reality. My basic assumption in both books has been that the artic ulation points in learning to be a sorcerer were the states of non - ordinary reality produced by the ingestion of psychotropic plan ts. In this respect don Juan was an expert in the use of three such plan ts: Datura inoxia, commonly known as jimson weed; Lofi hophora william sii, known as peyote; an d a hallucinogenic mushroom of the genus Psilocybe. My perception of the world through the effects of those psychotropics had been so bizar re an d impressive that I was forced to assume that such states were the only a venue to communicating an d learning what don Juan was attempting to teach me. That assumption was erroneous. For the purposes of av oiding an y misunderstandings about my work with don Juan I would like to clarify the following issues at this point. So far I hav e mad e no attempt whatsoever to place don Juan in a cultural milieu. The fact that he considers himself to be a Yaqu i Indian does not mean that his knowledge of sorcery is known to or practiced by the Yaqu i Indian s in general. All the conversations tha t don Juan an d I hav e had throughout the ap prenticeship were conducted in Span ish, an d only becau se of his thorough comman d of that lan guag e was I cap ab le of obtaining complex explan ations of his system of beliefs. I hav e maintained the practice of referri ng to that system as sorcery an d I hav e also maintained the practice of referring to don Juan as a sorcerer, becau se these were categories he himself used."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 Since I was cap ab le of writing down most of what was said in the beginning of the ap prenticeship, an d everything that was said in the later phases of it, I gathered voluminous field notes. In order to render those notes read ab le an d still preserve the dram atic unity of don Juan 's teachings, I hav e had to edit them, but what I hav e deleted is, I believe, immaterial to the points I wan t to raise. In the case of my work with don Juan I hav e limited my efforts solely to viewing him as a sorcerer an d to acqu iring membership in his knowledge. For the purpose of presenting my argument I must first explain the ba sic premise of sorcery as don Juan presented it to me. He said that for a sorcerer, the world of everyday life is not real, or out there, as we believe it is. For a sorcerer, reality, or the world we all know, is only a description. For the sak e of validat ing this premise don Juan concentrated the best of his efforts into lead ing me to a genuine conviction that what I held in mind as the world at han d was merely a description of the world; a description that had been pounded into me from the moment I was bo rn. He pointed out that everyone who comes into contact with a child is a teacher who incessan tly describes the world to him, until the moment when the child is cap ab le of perceiving the world as it is described. According to don Juan , we hav e no memory of that portentous moment, simply becau se none of us could possibly hav e had an y point of reference to compare it to an ything else. From that moment on, however, the child is a member. He knows the description of the world; an d his membership becomes fullfle dged, I suppose, when he is cap ab le of mak ing all the proper perceptual interpretations which, by conforming to that description, validate it. For don Juan , then, the reality of our day - to - day life consists of an endless flow of perceptual interpretations which we, the individuals who share a specific membership, hav e learned to mak e in common. The idea that the perceptual interpretations that mak e up the world hav e a flow is congruous with the fact that they run uninterruptedly an d are rarely, if ever, ope n to qu estion. In fact, the reality of the world we know is so tak en for gran ted that the basic premise of sorcery, that our reality is merely one of man y descriptions, could hardly be tak en as a serious proposition. Fortunately, in the case of my ap prent iceship, don Juan was not concerned at all with whether or not I could tak e his proposition seriously, an d he proceeded to elucidate his points, in spite of my opposition, my disbelief, an d my inab ility to understan d what he was say ing. Thus, as a teacher of sorcery, don Juan endeav ored to describe the world to me from the very first time we talked. My difficulty in grasping his concepts an d methods stemmed from the fact that the units of his description were alien an d incompatible with those of my own. His contention was that he was teaching me how to \"see\" as opposed to merely \"looking, \" an d that \"stopping the world\" was the first step to \"seeing.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 For years I had treated the idea of \"stopping the world\" as a cryptic metap hor that really did not mean an yt hing. It was only during an informal conversation that took place towards the end of my ap prenticeship that I cam e to fully realize its scope an d importan ce as one of the main propositions of donJuan 's knowledge. Don Juan an d I had been talking ab out diffe rent things in a relax ed an d unstructured man ner. I told him about a friend of mine an d his dilemma with his nine year old son. The child, who had been living with the mother for the past four years, was then living with my friend, an d the problem was what to do with him? According to my friend, the child was a misfit in school; he lacked concentration an d was not interested in an ything. He was given to tan trums, disruptive behav ior, an d to running away from home. \"Your friend certainly does hav e a problem, \" don Juan said, lau ghing. I wan ted to keep on telling him all the \"terrible\" things the child had done, but he interrupted me. \"There is no need to say an y more ab out that poor little boy, \" he said. \"There is no need for you or for me to regard his acti ons in our thoughts one way or an other.\" His man ner was abrupt an d his tone was firm, but then he smiled. \"Wh at can my friend do?\" I asked. \"The worst thing he could do is to force that child to ag ree with him,\" don Juan said. \"Wh at do you mean ?\" \"I mean t hat that child shouldn't be span ked or scared by his father when he doesn't behav e the way he wan ts him to.\" \"How can he teach him an ything if he isn't firm with him?\" \"Your friend should let someone else span k the child.\" \"He can 't let an yone else touch h is little boy!\" I said, surprised at his suggestion. Don Juan seemed to enjoy my reaction an d giggled. \"Your friend is not a warrior, \" he said. \"If he were, he would know that the worst thing one can do is to confront human beings bluntly.\" \"Wh at does a w arrior do, don Juan ?\" \"A warrior proceeds strategically.\" \"I still don't understan d what you mean .\" \"I mean that if your friend were a warrior he would help his child to stop the world.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 \"How can my friend do that?\" \"He would need personal power. He would need to be a sorcerer.\" \"But he isn't.\" \"In that case he must use ordinary mean s to help his son to chan ge his idea of the world. It is not stopping the world, but it will work just the sam e.\" I asked him to explain his statements. \"If I were your friend, \" don Juan said, \"I would start by hiring someone to span k the little guy. I would go to skid row an d hire the worst looking man I could find.\" \"To scare a little boy?\" \"Not just to scare a little boy, you fool. That little fellow must be stopped, an d bein g beaten by his father won't do it. \"If one wan ts to stop our fellow men one must alway s be outside the circle that presses them. That way one can always direct the pressure.\" The idea was preposterous, but somehow it was ap pealing to me. Don Juan was rest ing his chin on his left palm. His left arm was propped against his chest on a wooden box that served as a low table. His eyes were closed but his eyeballs moved. I felt he was looking at me through his closed eyelids. The thought scared me. \"Tell me more ab out what my friend should do with his little boy, \" I said. \"Tell him to go to skid row an d very carefully select an ugly looking derelict, \" he went on. \"Tell him to get a young one. One who still has some strength left in him.\" Don Juan then delineated a stran ge strategy. I was to instruct my friend to hav e the man follow him or wait for him at a place where he would go with his son. The man , in response to a prearran ged cue to be given after an y objectionab le behav ior on the part of the child, was supp osed to leap from a hiding place, pick the child up, an d span k the living day lights out of him. \"After the man scares him, your friend must help the little boy regain his confidence, in an y way he can . If he follows this procedure three or four times I ass ure you that that child will feel differently towards everything. He will chan ge his idea of the world.\"' \"Wh at if the fright injures him?\" \"Fright never injures an yone. Wh at injures the spirit is hav ing someone always on your back, beating you, telling yo u what to do an d what not to do. \"Wh en that boy is more contained you must tell your friend to do one last thing for him. He must find some way to get to a dead child, perhap s in a hospital, or at the office of a doctor. He must tak e his son there an d show the dead child to him. He must let him"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 touch the corpse once with his left han d, on any place except the corpse's belly. After the boy does that he will be renewed. The world will never be the sam e for him.\" I realized then that throughout the years of ou r association don Juan had been employing with me, although on a different scale, the sam e tactics he was suggesting my friend should use with his son. I asked him about it. He said that he had been trying all along to teach me how to \"stop the world.\" \"Yo u hav en't yet, \" he said, smiling. \"Nothing seems to work, becau se you are very stubborn. If you were less stubborn, however, by now you would probab ly hav e stopped the world with an y of the techniqu es I hav e taught you.\" \"Wh at techniqu es, don Juan ?\" \"Ever ything I hav e told you to do was a techniqu e for stopping the world.\" A few months after that conversation don Juan accomplished what he had set out to do, to teach me to \"stop the world.\" That monumental event in my life compelled me to re - exam ine in deta il my work of ten years. It becam e evident to me that my original assumption ab out the role of psychotropic plan ts was erroneous. They were not the essential feature of the sorcerer's description of the world, but were only an aid to cement, so to speak , p arts of the description which I had been incap ab le of perceiving otherwise. My insistence on holding on to my stan dard version of reality rendered me almost deaf an d blind to don Juan 's aims. Therefore, it was simply my lack of sensitivity which had foster ed their use. In reviewing the totality of my field notes I becam e aw are that don Juan had given me the bulk of the new description at the very beginning of our association in what he called \"techniqu es for stopping the world.\" I had discarded those parts of my field notes in my earlier works becau se they did not pertain to the use of psychotropic plan ts. I hav e now rightfully reinstated them in the total scope of don Juan 's teachings an d they comprise the first seventeen chap ters of this work. The last thr ee chap ters are the field notes covering the events that culminated in my \"stopping the world.\" In summing up I can say that when I began the ap prenticeship, there was an other reality, that is to say , there was a sorcery description of the world, which I d id not know. Don Juan , as a sorcerer an d a teacher, tau ght me that description. The ten year ap prenticeship I hav e undergone consisted, therefore, in setting up that unknown reality by unfolding its description, ad ding increasingly more complex parts as I went along. The termination of the ap prenticeship mean t that I had learned a new description of the world in a convincing an d au thentic man ner an d thus I had become cap ab le of eliciting a new perception of the world, which matched its new description. In o ther words, I had gained membership. Don Juan stated that in order to arrive at \"seeing\" one first had to \"stop the world.\" \"Stopping the world\" was indeed an ap propriate rendition of certain states of aw areness in which the reality of everyday life is alt ered becau se the flow of interpretation, which"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 ordinarily runs uninterruptedly, has been stopped by a set of circumstan ces alien to that flow. In my case the set of circumstan ces alien to my normal flow of interpretations was the sorcery description of the world. Don Juan's precondition for \"stopping the world\" was that one had to be convinced; in other words, one had to learn the new description in a total sense, for the purpose of pitting it against the old one, an d in that way break the dogmatic certaint y, which we all share, that the validity of our perceptions, or our reality of the world, is not to be qu estioned. After \"stopping the world\" the next step was \"seeing.\" By that don Juan mean t what I would like to categorize as \"responding to the perceptua l solicitations of a world outside the description we hav e learned to call reality.\" My contention is that all these steps can only be understood in terms of the description to which they belong; an d since it was a description that he endeav ored to give me from the beginning, I must then let his teachings be the only source of entran ce into it. Thus, I hav e left don Juan 's words to speak for themselves.

A friend of mine had just put us in contact an d left the room an d we had introduced ourselves to each other. The old man had told me that his nam e was Juan Matus. \"Did your friend tell you th at?\" he asked casually. \"Yes, he did.\" \"I pick plan ts, or rather, they let me pick them, \" he said We were in the waiting room of a bus depot in Arizo na. I asked him in very formal Span ish if he would allow me to qu estion him. I said, \"Wo uld the gentleman [cab allero] permit me to ask some qu estions?\" \"Cab allero, \" which is derived from the word \"cab allo,\" horse, originally mean t horseman or a nobleman on horseback. He looked at me inqu isitively. \"I'm a horseman without a horse, \" he said with a big smile an d then he ad ded, \"I've told you that my nam e is Juan Matos.\" I liked his smile. I thought that, obviously he was a man that could ap preciate directness an d I decided to boldly tackle him with a requ est. I told him I was interested in collecting an d studyin g medicinal plan ts. I said that my special interest was the uses of the hallucinogenic cactus, peyote, which I had studied at length at the university in Los Angeles. I thought that my presentation was very serious. I was very contained an d sounded perfect ly credible to myself. The old man shook his head slowly, an d I, encourag ed by his silence, added that it would no doubt be profitab le for us to get together an d talk about peyote. It was at that moment that he lifted his head and looked me squ arely in the eyes. It was a formidable look. Yet it was not menacing or aw esome in an y way . It was a look that went through me. I becam e tongue tied at once an d could not continue with the haran gues ab out myself. That was the end of our meeting. Yet he left on a note of hope. He said that perhap s I could visit him at his house someday ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 It would be difficult to assess the impact of don Juan 's look if my inventory of experience is not somehow brought to bear on the uniqu eness of that event. Wh en I began to study an thropo logy an d thus met don Juan , I was already an expert in \"getting around.\" I had left my home years before an d that mean t in my evaluation that I was cap ab le of tak ing care of myself. Wh enever I was rebuffed could usually cajole my way in or mak e concessions , argue, get an gry, or if nothing succeeded I would whine or complain; in other words, there was alway s something I knew I could do under the circumstan ces, an d never in my life had an y human being stopped my momentum so swiftly an d so definitely as don Ju an did that afternoon. But it was not only a matter of being silenced; there had been times when I had been unab le to say a word to my opponent becau se of some inherent respect I felt for him, still my an ger or frustration was man ifested in my thoughts. Do n Juan 's look, however, numbed me to the point that I could not think coherently. I becam e thoroughly intrigued with that stupendous look an d decided to search for him. I prepared myself for six months, after that first meeting, read ing up on the uses of p eyote am ong the American Indian s, especially ab out the peyote cult of the Indian s of the Plains. I becam e acqu ainted with every work av ailab le, an d when I felt I was ready I went back to Arizo na. Saturday , December 17, 1960 I found his house after mak ing long an d tax ing inqu iries am ong the local Indian s. It was early afternoon when I arrived an d parked in front of it. I saw him sitting on a wooden milk crate. He seemed to recognize me an d greeted me as I got out of my car. We exchan ged social courtesies fo r a while an d then, in plain terms, I confessed that I had been very devious with him the first time we had met. I had boasted that I knew a great deal about peyote, when in reality I knew nothing ab out it. He stared at me. His eyes were very kind. I told him that for six months I had been read ing to prepare myself for our meeting an d that this time I really knew a great deal more. He lau ghed. Obviously, there was something in my statement which was funny to him. He was lau ghing at me an d I felt a bit confu sed an d offended. He ap parently noticed my discomfort an d assured me that although I had had good intentions there was really no way to prepare myself for our meeting. I wondered if it would hav e been proper to ask whether that statement had an y hidden mea ning, but I did not; yet he seemed to be attuned to my feelings an d proceeded to explain what he had mean t. He said that my endeav ors reminded him of a story about some people a certain king had persecuted an d killed once upon a time. He said that in the s tory the persecuted people were indistinguishab le from their persecutors, except that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 they insisted on pronouncing certain words in a peculiar man ner proper only to them; that flaw , of course, was the giveaway . The king posted road blocks at critical points where an official would ask every man passing by to pronounce a key word. Those who could pronounce it the way the king pronounced it would live, but those who could not were immediately put to death. The point of the story was that one day a young man de cided to prepare himself for passing the road block by learning to pronounce the test word just as the king liked it. Don Juan said, with a broad smile, that in fact it took the young man \"six months\" to master such a pronunciation. And then cam e the day of the great test; the young man very confidently cam e upon the road block an d waited for the official to ask him to pronounce the word. At that point don Juan very dram atically stopped his recounting an d looked at me. His pau se was very studied an d seemed a bit corny to me, but I play ed along. I had heard the theme of the story before. It had to do with Jews in German y an d the way one could tell who was a Jew by the way they pronounced certain words. I also knew the punch line: the young man was going to get cau ght becau se the official had forgotten the key word an d asked him to pronounce an other word which was very similar but which the young man had not learned to say correctly. Don Juan seemed to be waiting for me to ask what hap pened, so I did. \"Wh at hap pe ned to him?\" I asked, trying to sound naive an d interested in the story. \"The young man , who was truly foxy, \" he said, \"realized that the official had forgotten the key word, an d before the man could say an ything else he confessed that he had prepared him self for six months.\" He mad e an other pau se an d looked at me with a mischievous glint in his eyes. This time he had turned the tab les on me. The young man 's confession was a new element an d I no longer knew how the story would end. \"We ll, what hap pened the n?\" I asked, truly interested. \"The young man was killed instan tly, of course, \" he said an d broke into a roaring lau ghter. I liked very much the way he had entrap ped my interest; ab ove all I liked the way he had linked that story to my own case. In fact, he seemed to hav e constructed it to fit me. He was mak ing fun of me in a very subtle an d artistic man ner. I lau ghed with him. Afterwards I told him that no matter how stupid I sounded I was really interested in learning something ab out plan ts. \"I like to w alk a great deal, \" he said. I thought he was deliberately chan ging the topic of conversation to av oid an swering me. I did not wan t to an tag onize him with my insistence."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 He asked me if I wan ted to go with him on a short hike in the desert.

I said that I needed information, an y kind of information, on the uses of medicinal herbs, an d that I was willing to pay him for his time an d effort. \"You'll be working for me, \" I said. \"And I'll pay you wag es.\" \"How much would you pay me?\" he asked. I detected a note of greed in his voice. \"Wh atever you think is ap propriate, \" I said. \"Pay me for my time . . . with your time, \" he said. I thought he was a most peculiar fellow. I told him I did not understan d what he mean t. He replied that there was nothing to say ab out plan ts, thus to tak e my money would be unthinkab le for him. He looked at me piercingly. \"Wh at are you doing in your pocket?\" he asked, frowning. \"Are you play ing with your whan ger?\" He was referring to my tak ing notes on a minute pad inside the enormous pockets of my windbreaker. Wh en I told him what I was doing he lau ghed heartily. I said t hat I did not wan t to disturb him by writing in front of him. \"If you wan t to write, write, \" he said. \"You don't disturb me.\" We hiked in the surrounding desert until it was almost dark. He did not show me an y plan ts nor did he talk ab out them at all. We stopped for a moment to rest by some large bushes. \"Plan ts are very peculiar things, \" he said without looking at me. \"They are alive an d they feel.\" At the very moment he made that statement a strong gust of wind shook the desert chap arral around us. The bushes mad e a rattling noise. \"Do you hear that?\" he asked me, putting his right han d to his ear as if he were aiding his hearing. \"The leav es an d the wind are ag reeing with me.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 I lau ghed.

Using all the patience I had, I explained to him that these were very serious qu estions an d that it was very importan t for my work to fill out the forms. I tried to mak e him understan d the idea of a genealogy an d personal history. \"Wh at were the nam es of your father an d mother?\" I asked. He looked at me with clear kind eyes. \"Don't waste your time with that crap , \" he said softly but with unsuspected force. I did not know what to say ; it was as if someone else had uttered those words. A moment before, he had been a fumbling stupid Indian scratching his head , an d then, in an instan t he had reversed the roles; I was the stupid one, an d he was staring at me with an indescribable look that was no t a look of arrogan ce, or defian ce, or hatred, or contempt.

I suddenly felt ill at ease, threatened. I reminded him that he had assured me that it was all right to ask him qu estions. He reiterated that he did not mind at all. \"I don't hav e p ersonal history an y more, \" he said an d looked at me probingly. \"I dropped it one day when I felt it was no longer necessary.\" I stared at him, trying to detect the hidden mean ings of his words. \"How can one drop one's personal history?\" I asked in an argu mentative mood. \"One must first hav e the desire to drop it, \" he said. \"And then one must proceed harmoniously to chop it off, little by little.\" \"Wh y should an yone hav e such a desire?\" I exclaimed. I had a terribly strong attachment to my personal history . My fam ily roots were deep. I honestly felt that without them my life had no continuity or purpose. \"Perhap s you should tell me what you mean by dropping one's personal history, \" I said. \"To do aw ay with it, that's what I mean , \" he replied cuttingly. I insisted that I must not hav e understood the proposition. \"Tak e you for instan ce, \" I said. \"You are a Yaq ui.

And I assure you that no one will ever know that for sure.\" I had written down what he had said in a clumsy way . I stopped writing an d looked at him. I could not figure him out. I mentally ran through my impressions of him; the myste rious an d unprecedented way he had looked at me during our first meeting, the charm with which he had claimed that he received ag reement from everything around him, his an noying humor an d his alertness, his look of bona fide stupidity when I asked ab out hi s father an d mother, an d then the unsuspected force of his statements which had snap ped me ap art. \"You don't know what I am , do you?\" he said as if he were read ing my thoughts. \"You will never know who or what I am , becau se I don't hav e a personal history. \" He asked me if I had a father. I told him I did. He said that my father was an exam ple of what he had in mind. He urged me to remember what my father thought of me. \"Your father knows everything ab out you, \" he said. \"So he has you all figured out. He kn ows who you are an d what you do, an d there is no power on earth that can mak e him chan ge his mind about you.\" Don Juan said that everybody that knew me had an idea ab out me, an d that I kept feeding that idea with everything I did. \"Don't you see?\" he asked dram atically. \"You must renew your personal history by telling your parents, your relatives, an d your friends everything you do. On the other han d, if you hav e no personal history, no explan ations are needed; nobody is an gry or disillusioned with your act s. And ab ove all no one pins you down with their thoughts.\" Suddenly the idea becam e clear in my mind. I had almost known it myself, but I had never exam ined it. Not hav ing personal history was indeed an ap pealing concept, at least on the intellectual leve l; it gav e me, however, a sense of loneliness which I found threatening an d distasteful. I wan ted to discuss my feelings with him, but I kept myself in check; something was terribly incongruous in the situation at han d. I felt ridiculous trying to get into a philosophical argument with an old Indian who obviously did not hav e the \"sophistication\" of a university student. Somehow he had led me aw ay from my original intention of asking him ab out his genealogy. \"I don't know how we ended up talking ab out this when all I wan ted was some nam es for my charts, \" I said, trying to steer the conversation back to the topic I wan ted. \"It's terribly simple, \" he said. \"The way we ended up talking about it was becau se I said that to ask qu estions about one's past is a bu nch of crap .\""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 His tone was firm.

The thought crossed my mind that I was in the presence of a born actor. \"Wr ite it down, \" he said patronizingly. \"Wh y not? You seem to be more comfortab le writing.\" I looked at him an d my eyes must ha ve betray ed my confusion. He slap ped his thighs an d lau ghed with great delight. \"It is best to erase all personal history, \" he said slowly, as if giving me time to write it down in my clumsy way , \"becau se that would mak e us free from the encumbering thoug hts of other people.\" I could not believe that he was actually say ing that. I had a very confusing moment. He must hav e read in my face my inner turmoil an d used it immediately. \"Tak e yourself, for instan ce, \" he went on say ing. \"Right now you don't know w hether you are coming or going.

I fan cied him to be an Indian chief, a \"red - skinned warrior\" in the roman tic fronti er sag as of my childhood. My roman ticism carried me aw ay an d the most insidious feeling of am bivalence enveloped me. I could sincerely say that I liked him a great deal an d in the sam e breath I could say that I was dead ly afraid of him. He maintained that stran ge stare for a long moment. \"How can I know who I am , when I am all this?\" he said, sweeping the surroundings with a gesture of his head . Then he glan ced at me an d smiled. \"Little by little you must create a fog around yourself; you must erase everyt hing around you until nothing can be tak en for granted, until nothing is an y longer for sure, or real. Your problem now is that you're too real. Your endeav ors are too real; your moods are too real. Don't tak e things so for gran ted.

All my life I had reached a break ing point when someone attempted to tell me what to do; the mere thought of being told what to do put me imm ediately on the defensive. \"You said that you wan ted to learn about plan ts, \" he said calmly. \"Do you wan t to get something for nothing? Wh at do you think this is? We agreed that you would ask me qu estions an d I'd tell you what I know. If you don't like it , there is nothing else we can say to each other.\" His terrible directness mad e me feel peeved, and begrudgingly I conceded that he was right. \"Let's put it this way then, \" he went on. \"If you wan t to learn ab out plan ts, since there is really nothing to s ay about them, you must, am ong other things, erase your personal history.\" \"How?\" I asked. \"Begin with simple things, such as not revealing what you really do. Then you must leav e everyone who knows you well. This way you'll build up a fog around yourself. \" \"But that's ab surd, \" I protested. \"Wh y shouldn't people know me?

His reply was that I misled everybody anyway . The old man had touched a sore spot in my life. I did not pau se to ask him what he mean t by that or how he knew that I mystified people all the time. I simply reacted to his statement, defending myself by mean s of an explan ation. I said that I was painfully aware that my fam ily an d my friends believed I was unreliab le, when in reality I had never told a lie in my life. \"Yo u alway s knew how to lie, \" he said. \"The only thing that was missing was that you didn't know why to do it.

After a whi le I calmed down an d he continued talking. \"Wh en one does not hav e personal history, \" he explained, \"nothing that one say s can be tak en for a lie. Your trouble is that you hav e to explain everything to everybody, compulsively, an d at the sam e time you wan t to keep the freshness, the newness of what you do.

I wrote down all the details of our exchan ge in the best way I could, concentrating on what he was say ing rather than pau sing to deliberate on my prejudices or on his mean ings. \"From now on, \" he said, \"you must simply show people whatever you care to show them, but without ever telling exac tly how you've done it.\" \"I can 't keep secrets!\" I exclaimed. \"Wh at you are say ing is useless to me.\" \"Then chan ge!\" he said cuttingly an d with a fierce glint in his eyes. He looked like a stran ge wild an imal. And yet he was so coherent in his thoughts an d so verbal.

I did not know what to ask. Finally he got up an d asked me to drive him to the nearby town. I did not know why but our conversation had drained me. I felt like going to sleep. He asked me to stop on the way an d told me that if I wan ted to relax , I had to climb to the flat top of a small hill on the side of the road an d lie down on my stomach with my head towards the east.

We drove to the center of town, where he told me to let him off. \"Come back, \" he said as he stepped out of the car. \"Be sure to come back.\" I had the opportunity of discussing my two previous visits to Don Juan with the friend who had put us in contact. It was his opinion that I was wasting my time. I related to him, in every detail, t he scope of our conversations. He thought I was exag gerating an d roman ticizing a silly old fogy. There was very little room in me for roman ticizing such a preposterous old man . I sincerely felt that his criticisms ab out my personality had seriously undermi ned my liking him. Yet I had to ad mit that they had always been ap ropos, sharply delineated, an d true to the letter. The crux of my dilemma at that point was my unwillingness to accept that don Juan was very cap ab le of disrupting all my preconceptions ab ou t the world, an d my unwillingness to ag ree with my friend who believed that \"the old Indian was just nuts.\" I felt compelled to pay him an other visit before I mad e up my mind. We dnesday , December 28, 1960 Immediately after I arrived at his house he took m e for a walk in the desert chap arral. He did not even look at the bag of groceries that I had brought him. He seemed to hav e been waiting for me. We walked for hours. He did not collect or show me an y plan ts. He did, however, teach me an \"ap propriate form of walking.\" He said that I had to curl my fingers gently as I walked so I would keep my attention on the trail an d the surroundings.

His idea was that by forcing the han ds into a specific position one was cap ab le of greater stam ina an d greater awareness. I saw no point in arguing an d curled my fin gers as he had prescribed an d kept on walking. My aw areness was in no way different, nor was my stam ina. We started our hike in the morning an d we stopped to rest around noon. I was perspiring an d tried to drink from my can teen, but he stopped me by say ing that it was better to hav e only a sip of water. He cut some leav es from a small yellowish bush an d chewed them. He gav e me some an d remarked that they were excellent, an d if I chewed them slowly my thirst would van ish. It did not, but I was not uncomforta ble either. He seemed to hav e read my thoughts an d explained that I had not felt the benefits of the \"right way of walking or the benefits of chewing the leav es becau se I was young an d strong an d my body did not notice an ything becau se it was a bit stupid.

At that moment an enormous crow flew right over us caw ing That startled m e an d I began to lau gh. I thought that the occasion called for lau ghter, but to my utter am aze ment he shook my arm vigorously an d hushed me up. He had a most serious expression. \"That was not a joke, \" he said severely, as if I knew what he was talking ab o ut. I asked for an explan ation. I told him that it was incongruous that my lau ghing at the crow had made him an gry when we had lau ghed at the coffee percolator. \"Wh at you saw was not just a crow!\" he exclaimed. \"But I saw it an d it was a crow, \" I insisted . \"You saw nothing, you fool, \" he said in a gruff voice. His rudeness was uncalled for. I told him that I did not like to mak e people an gry an d that perhap s it would be better if I left, since he did not seem to be in a mood to hav e compan y. He lau ghed up roariously, as if I were a clown performing for him. My an noyan ce an d embarrassment grew in proportion. \"You're very violent, \" he commented casually. \"You're tak ing yourself too seriously.\" \"But weren't you doing the sam e?\" I interjected. \"Tak ing yourself seriously when you got an gry at me?\" He said that to get an gry at me was the farthest thing from his mind.

At that very instan t the wind blew the dry branch of a bush right to our feet. \"That was an ag reement!\" he exclaimed an d looked at me with shiny eyes an d broke in to a belly lau gh.

He was obviously imitating some popular singer. He elongated certain syllab les an d contracted others an d mad e the song into a most farcical affair. It was so comical that I ended up lau ghing. \"You see, you lau gh at the stupid song , \" he said. \"But the man who sings it that way an d those who pay to listen to him are not lau ghing; they think it is serious.\" \"Wh at do you mean ?\" I asked. I thought he had deliberately concocted the exam ple to tell me that I had lau ghed at the crow becau se I had not tak en it seriously, the sam e way I had not tak en the song seriously. But he baffled me ag ain. He said I was like the singer an d the people who liked his songs, conceited an d dead ly serious ab out some nonsense that no one in his right mind shou ld give a dam n ab out. He then recap itulated, as if to refresh my memory, all he had said before on the topic of \"learning ab out plan ts.\" He stressed emphatically that if I really wan ted to learn, I had to remodel most of my behav ior.

He personally organ ized an d carried out a meticulous vigil, an d after day s of stead y watching we finally saw a big white bird flying away with a young Leghorn chicken in its claws. The bird was fast an d ap parently knew its route. It swooped down from behind some trees, grab bed the chicken an d flew aw ay through an opening between two bran ches. It hap pened so fast that my grandfather had hardly seen it, but I did an d I knew that it was indeed a falcon. My gran dfather said that if that was the case it had to be an albino. We started a cam paign ag ainst the albino falcon an d twice I thought I had gotten it. It even dropped its prey, but it got aw ay . It was too fast for me. It was also very intelligent; it never cam e back to hu nt on my gran dfather's farm. I would hav e forgotten ab out it had my gran dfather not needled me to hunt the bird. For two months I chased the albino falcon all over the valley where I lived.

I could boast that I had prevented it from tak ing its prey, perhap s every time we had met, but I could never bag it. In the two months that I carried on the stran ge war ag ainst th e albino falcon I cam e close to it only once. I had been chasing it all day an d I was tired.

In order to tak e a better shot I would hav e needed to move an d the falcon was too fast for that. I thought that my best alternative was to wait. And I did, a long, interminab le time. Perhap s what affected me was the long wait, or perhap s it was the loneliness of the spot where the bird an d I were; I suddenly felt a chill up my spine an d in an unprecedented action I stood up an d left.

Don Juan listened attentively as I told him the story of the albino falcon. \"How did you know ab out the white falcon?\" I asked when I had finished. \"I saw it, \" he replied. \"Wh ere?\" \"Right here in front of you.\" I was not in an argumentative mood an y more. \"Wh at does all this mean ?\" I asked.

He had delivered a stag gering blow to my egotism. The pettiness o f being an noyed with him was monstrous in the fight of my death. I had the feeling he was fully aw are of my change of mood.

Don Juan asked me matter - of - factly why I had not voiced my opinions at the time. \"You don't tell your father things like that, \" I said as a weak explan ation."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 \"Wh y not?\" \"That was not done in my house, th at's all.\" \"You hav e done worse things in your house, \" he declared like a judge from the bench. \"The only thing you never did was to shine your spirit.\" There was such a devastating force in his words that they echoed in my mind. He brought all my defense s down. I could not argue with him. I took refuge in writing my notes. I tried a last feeble explan ation an d said that all my life I had encountered people of my father's kind, who had, like my father, hooked me somehow into their schemes, an d as a rule I had alway s been left dan gling. \"You are complaining, \" he said softly. \"You hav e been complaining all your life becau se you don't assume responsibility for your decisions. If you would hav e assumed responsibility for your father's idea of swimming at six i n the morning, you would hav e swum, by yourself if necessary, or you would hav e told him to go to hell the first time he opened his mouth after you knew his devices. But you didn't say an ything. Therefore, you were as weak as your father.\" \"To assume the r esponsibility of one's decisions mean s that one is ready to die for them.\" \"Wai t, wait!\" I said. \"You are twisting this around.\" He did not let me finish. I was going to tell him that I had used my father only as an exam ple of an unrealistic way of acting, an d that nobody in his right mind would be willing to die for such an idiotic thing. \"It doesn't matter what the decision is, \" he said. \"Nothing could be more or less serious than an ything else. Don't you see? In a world where death is the hunter there a re no small or big decisions. There are only decisions that we mak e in the face of our inevitab le death.\" I could not say an ything. Perhap s an hour went by. Don Juan was perfectly motionless on his mat although he was not sleeping. \"Wh y do you tell me all this, don Juan ?\" I asked. \"Wh y are you doing this to me?\" \"You cam e to me, \" he said. \"No, that was not the case, you were brought to me. And I hav e had a gesture with you.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"You could hav e had a gesture with your father by swimming fo r him, but you didn't, perhap s becau se you were too young. I hav e lived longer than you. I hav e nothing pending. There is no hurry in my life, therefore I can properly hav e a gesture with you.\" In the afternoon we went for a hike. I easily kept his pace an d marveled again at his stupendous physical prowess. He walked so nimbly an d with such sure steps that next to him I was like a child. We went in an easterly direction. I noticed then that he did not like to talk while he walked. If I spoke to him he would stop walking in order to an swer me."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 After a couple of hours we cam e to a hill; he sat down an d signaled me to sit by him. He an nounced in a mock dram atic tone that he was going to tell me a story. He said that once upon a time there was a young man , a des titute Indian who lived am ong the white men in a city. He had no home, no relatives, no friends. He had come into the city to find his fortune an d had found only misery an d pain. From time to time he made a few cents working like a mule, barely enough for a morsel; otherwise he had to beg or steal food. Don Juan said that one day the young man went to the market place. He walked up an d down the street in a haze , his eyes wild upon seeing all the good things that were gathered there. He was so fran tic that h e did not see where he was walking, an d ended up tripping over some baskets an d falling on lap of an old man . The old man was carrying four enormous gourds an d had just sat down to rest an d eat. Don Juan smiled knowingly an d said that the old man found it qu ite stran ge that the young man had stumbled on him. He was not an gry at being disturbed but am aze d at why this particular young man had fallen on top of him. The young man , on the other han d, was an gry an d told him to get out of his way . He was not conce rned at all about the ultimate reason for their meeting. He had not noticed that their paths had actually crossed. Don Juan mimicked the motions of someone going after something that was rolling over. He said that the old man 's gourds had turned over an d w ere rolling down the street. Wh en the young man saw the gourds he thought he had found his food for the day . He helped the old man up an d insisted on helping him carry the heav y gourds. The old man told him that he was on his way to his home in the mountai ns an d the young man insisted on going with him, at least part of the way. The old man took the road to the mountains and as they hiked he gav e the young man part of the food he had bought at the market. The young man ate to his heart's content an d when he was qu ite satisfied he began to notice how heav y the gourds were an d clutched them tightly. Don Juan opened his eyes an d smiled with a devilish grin a said that the young man asked, \"Wh at do you carry in these gourds?\" The old man did not an swer but told him that he was going to show him a compan ion or friend who could alleviate his sorrows an d give him ad vice an d wisdom ab out the ways of the world. Don Juan mad e a majestic gesture with both han ds an d said that the old man summoned the most beau tiful deer that the young man had ever seen. The deer was so tam e that it cam e to him an d walked around him. It glittered an d shone. The young man was spellbound an d knew right aw ay that it was a \"spirit deer.\" The old man told him then that if he wished to hav e that friend an d its wisdom all he had to do was to let go of the gourds. Don Juan 's grin portray ed am bition; he said that the young man 's petty desires were pricked upon hearing such a requ est. Don Juan's eyes becam e small an d devilish as he voiced the young m an 's qu estion: \"Wh at do you hav e in these four enormous gourds?\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 Don Juan said that the old man very serenely replied that, he was carrying food: \"pinole\" an d water. He stopped narrating the story an d walked around in a circle a couple of times. I did not know what he was doing. But ap parently it was part of the story. The circle seemed to portray the deliberations of the young man . Don Juan said that, of course, the young man had not believed a word. He calculated that if the old man , who was obviously a w izar d, was willing to give a \"spirit deer\" for his gourds, then the gourds must hav e been filled with power beyond belief. Don Juan contorted his face ag ain into a devilish grin an d said that the young man declared that he wan ted to hav e the gourds. There was a long pau se that seemed to mark the end of the story. Don Juan remained qu iet, yet I was sure he wan ted me to ask ab out it, an d I did. \"Wh at hap pened to the young man ?\" \"He took the gourds, \" he replied with a smile of satisfaction. There was an other long pau se. I lau ghed. I thought that this had been a real \"Indian story.\" Don Juan 's eyes were shining as he smiled at me. There was an air of innocence ab out him. He began to lau gh in soft spurts and asked me, \"Don't you wan t to know about the gourds?\" \" Of course I wan t to know. I thought that was the end of the story.\" \"Oh no, \" he said with a mischievous light in his eyes. \"The young man took his gourds an d ran away to an isolated place an d opened them.\" \"Wh at did he find?\" I asked. Don Juan glan ced at me an d I had the feeling he was aw are of my mental gymnastics. He shook his head an d chuckled. \"We ll, \" I urged him. \"We re the gourds empty?\" \"There was only food an d water inside the gourds,\" he said. \"And the young man , in a fit of an ger, smashed them ag ainst the rocks.\" I said that his reaction was only natural - an yone in his position would hav e done the sam e. Don Juan 's reply was that the young man was a fool who did not know what he was looking for. He did not know what \"power\" was, so he could not tell whether or not he had found it. He had not tak en responsibility for his decision, therefore he was an gered by his blunder. He expected to gain something an d got nothing instead . Don Juan speculated that if I were the young man an d if I had followed my inc linations I would hav e ended up an gry an d remorseful, an d would, no doubt, hav e spent the rest of my life feeling sorry for myself for what I had lost. Then he explained the behav ior of the old man. He had cleverly fed the young man so as to give him the \" daring of a satisfied stomach, \" thus the young man upon finding only food in the gourds smashed them in a fit of an ger."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 \"Had he been aw are of his decision an d assumed responsibility for it, \" don Juan said, \"he would hav e tak en the food an d would've been more than satisfied with it.

He did not an swer me an d mad e an impatient gesture wit h his han d to be qu iet. He seemed to be in a serious mood. \"I was thinking that you hav en't chan ged at all in the time you've been trying to learn about plan ts, \" he said in an accusing tone. He began reviewing in a loud voice all the changes of personalit y he had recommended I should undertak e. I told him that I had considered the matter very seriously an d found that I could not possibly fulfill them becau se each of them ran contrary to my core. He replied that to merely consider them was not enough, an d t hat whatever he had said to me was not said just for fun. I ag ain insisted that, although I had done very little in matters of ad justing my personal life to his ideas, I really wan ted to learn the uses of plan ts. After a long, uneasy silence I boldly asked him, \"Wo uld you teach me ab out peyote, don Juan ?\" He said that my intentions alone were not enough, an d that to know ab out peyote - he called it \"Mescalito\" for the first time - was a serious matter. It seemed that there was nothing else to say . In the early evening, however, he set up a test for me; he put forth a problem without giving me an y clues to its solution: to find a beneficial place or spot in the area right in front of his door where we alway s sat to talk, a spot where I could allegedly feel perfec tly hap py an d invigorated. During the course of the night, while I attempted to find the \"spot\" by rolling on the ground, I twice detected a chan ge of coloration on the uniformly dark dirt floor of the designated area. The problem exhau sted me an d I fell a sleep on one of the places where I had detected the chan ge in color. In the morning don Juan woke me up an d an nounced that I had had a very successful experience. Not only had I found the beneficial spot I was looking for, but I had also found its opposite , an enemy or negative spot an d the colors associated with both. Saturday , June 24, 1961 We went into the desert chap arral in the early morning. As we walked, don Juan explained to me that finding a \"beneficial\" or an \"enemy\" spot was an importan t need fo r a man in the wilderness. I wan ted to steer the conversation to the topic of peyote, but he flatly refused to talk ab out it. He warned me that there should be no mention of it, unless he himself brought up the subject. We sat down to rest in the shad e of some tall bushes in an area of thick vegetation. The desert chap arral around us was not qu ite dry yet; it was a warm day an d the flies"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 kept on pestering me but they did not seem to bother don Juan . I wondered whether he was just ignoring them but then I no ticed they were not lan ding on his face at all. \"Sometimes it is necessary to find a beneficial spot qu ickly, out in the open, \" don Juan went on. \"Or may be it is necessary to determine qu ickly whether or not the spot where one is ab out to rest is a bad on e. One time, we sat to rest by some hill an d you got very an gry an d upset. That spot was your enemy. A little crow gav e you a warning, remember?\" I remembered that he had mad e a point of telling me to av oid that area in the future. I also remembered that I had become an gry becau se he had not let me lau gh. \"I thought that the crow that flew overhead was an omen for me alone, \" he said. \"I would never hav e suspected that the crows were friendly towards you too.\" \"Wh at are you talking ab out?\" \"The crow was an omen, \" he went on. \"If you knew ab out crows you would hav e av oided the place like the plag ue. Crows are not alway s av ailab le to give warning though, an d you must learn to find, by yourself, a proper place to cam p or to rest.\" After a long pau se don Juan s uddenly turned to me an d said that in order to find the proper place to rest all I had to do was to cross my eyes. He gav e me a knowing look an d in a confidential tone told me that I had done precisely that when I was rolling on his porch, an d thus I had b een cap ab le of finding two spots an d their colors. He let me know that he was impressed by my accomplishment. \"I really don't know what I did, \" I said. \"You crossed your eyes, \" he said emphatically. \"That's the techniqu e; you must hav e done that, althoug h you don't remember it.\" Don Juan then described the techniqu e, which he said took years to perfect, an d which consisted of gradually forcing the eyes to see separately the sam e imag e. The lack of imag e conversion entailed a double perception of the world ; this double perception, according to don Juan , allowed one the opportunity of judging chan ges in the surroundings, which the eyes were ordinarily incap ab le of perceiving. Don Juan coax ed me to try it. He assured me that it was not injurious to the sight. He said that I should begin by looking in short glan ces, almost with the corners of my eyes. He pointed to a large bush an d showed me how. I had a stran ge feeling, seeing don Juan 's eyes tak ing incredibly fast glan ces at the bush. His eyes reminded me of those of a shifty an imal that can not look straight. We walked for perhap s an hour while I tried not to focus my sight on an ything. Then don Juan asked me to start separating the images perceived by each of my eyes. After an other hour or so I got a terrible head ache an d had to stop. \"Do you think you could find, by yourself, a proper place for us to rest?\" he asked."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 I had no idea what the criterion for a \"proper place\" was. He patiently explained that looking in short glan ces allowed the eyes to pick out unu sual sights. \"Such as what?\" I asked. \"They are not sights proper, \" he said. \"They are more like feelings. If you look at a bush or a tree or a rock where you may like to rest, your eyes can mak e you feel whether or not that's the best resting place.\" I ag ain urged him to describe what those feelings were but he either could not describe them or he simply did not wan t to. He said that I should practice by picking out a place an d then he would tell me whether or not my eyes were working. At one moment I ca ught sight of what I thought was a pebble which reflected light. I could not see it if I focused my eyes on it, but if I swept the area with fast glan ces I could detect a sort of faint glitter. I pointed out the place to don Juan . It was in the middle of a n open unshad ed flat area devoid of thick bushes. He lau ghed uproariously an d then asked me why I had picked that specific spot. I explained that I was seeing a glitter. \"I don't care what you see, \" he said. \"You could be seeing an elephan t. How you feel is the importan t issue.\" I did not feel an ything at all. He gav e me a mysterious look an d said that he wished he could oblige me an d sit down to rest with me there, but he was going to sit somewhere else while I tested my choice. I sat down while he looked at me curiously from a distan ce of thirty or forty feet aw ay . After a few minutes he began to lau gh loudly. Somehow his lau ghter mad e me nervous. It put me on edge. I felt he was mak ing fun of me an d I got an gry. I began to qu estion my motives for being t here. There was definitely something wrong in the way my total endeav or with don Juan was proceeding. I felt that I was just a paw n in his clutches. Suddenly don Juan charged at me, at full speed, an d pulled me by the arm, drag ging me bodily for ten or twe lve feet. He helped me to stan d up an d wiped some perspiration from his forehead . I noticed then that he had exerted himself to his limit. He patted me on the back an d said that I had picked the wrong place an d that he had had to rescue me in a real hurry, becau se he saw that the spot where I was sitting was about to tak e over my entire feelings. I lau ghed. The imag e of don Juan charging at me was very funny. He had actually run like a young man . His feet moved as if he were grab bing the soft reddish dirt o f the desert in order to catap ult himself over me. I had seen him lau ghing at me an d then in a matter of seconds he was drag ging me by the arm. After a while he urged me to continue looking for a proper place to rest. We kept on walking but I did not detec t or \"feel\" an ything at all. Perhap s if I had been more relax ed I would hav e noticed or felt something. I had ceased, however, to be an gry with him."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 Finally he pointed to some rocks an d we cam e to a halt. \"Don't feel disap pointed, \" don Juan said. \"It tak e s a long time to train the eyes properly.\" I did not say an ything. I was not going to be disap pointed ab out something I did not understan d at all. Yet, I had to ad mit that three times alread y since I had begun to visit don Juan I had become very an gry an d had been ag itated to the point of being nearly ill while sitting on places that he called bad. \"The trick is to feel with your eyes, \" he said. \"Your problem now is that you don't know what to feel. It'll come to you, though, with practice.\" \"Perhap s you s hould tell me, don Juan , what I am supposed to feel.\" \"That's impossible.\" \"Wh y?\" \"No one can tell you what you are supposed to feel. It is not heat, or light, or glare, or color. It is something else.\" \"Can 't you describe it?\" \"No. All I can do is give yo u the techniqu e. Once you learn to separate the imag es an d see two of everything, you must focus your attention in the area between the two images. Any chan ge worthy of notice would tak e place there, in that area.\" \"Wh at kind of chan ges are they?\" \"That is not importan t. The feeling that you get is what counts. Every man is different. You saw glitter today , but that did not mean anything, becau se the feeling was missing. I can 't tell you how to feel. You must learn that yourself.\" We rested in silence for s ome time. Don Juan covered his face with his hat an d remained motionless as if he were asleep. I becam e ab sorbed in writing my notes, until he mad e a sudden movement that mad e me jolt. He sat up abruptly an d faced me, frowning. \"You hav e a knack for huntin g, \" he said. \"And that's what you should learn, hunting. We are not going to talk about plan ts an y more.\" He puffed out his jaws for an instan t, then can didly added, \"I don't think we ever hav e, anyway , hav e we?\" an d lau ghed. We spent the rest of the day walking in every direction while he gav e me an unbelievab ly detailed explan ation about rattlesnak es. The way they nest, the way they move around, their seasonal hab its, their qu irks of behav ior. Then he proceeded to corroborate each of the points he had ma de and finally he cau ght an d killed a large snak e; he cut its head off, clean ed its viscera, skinned it, an d roasted the meat. His movements had such a grace an d skill that it was a sheer pleasure just to be around him. I had listened to him an d watched hi m, spellbound. My concentration had been so complete that the rest of the world had practically van ished for me. Eating the snak e was a hard reentry into the world of ordinary affairs. I felt nau seated when I began to chew a bite of snak e meat. It was an i ll founded qu easiness, as the meat"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 was delicious, but my stomach seemed to be rather an independent unit. I could hardly swallow at all. I thought don Juan would hav e a heart attack from lau ghing so hard. Afterwards we sat down for a leisurely rest in the shad e of some rocks. I began to work on my notes, an d the qu an tity of them mad e me realize that he had given me an astonishing am ount of information about rattlesnak es. \"Your hunter's spirit has returned to you, \" don Juan said suddenly an d with a serious face. \"Now you're hooked.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" I wan ted him to elab orate on his statement that I was hooked, but he only lau ghed an d repeated it. \"How am I hooked?\" I insisted. \"Hunters will alway s hunt, \" he said. \"I am a hunter myself.\" \"Do you mean you hunt for a living?\" \"I hunt in order to live. I can live off the lan d, an ywhere.\" He indicated the total surroundings with his han d. \"To be a hunter mean s that one knows a great deal, \" he went on. \"It mean s that one can see the world in different way s. I n order to be a hunter one must be in perfect balan ce with everything else, otherwise hunting would become a mean ingless chore. For instan ce, today we took a little snak e. I had to ap ologize to her for cutting her life off so suddenly an d so definitely; I did what I did knowing that my own life will also be cut off someday in very much the sam e fashion, suddenly an d definitely. So, all in all, we an d the snak es are on a par. One of them fed us today .\" \"I had never conceived a balan ce of that kind when I us ed to hunt, \" I said. \"That's not true. You didn't just kill an imals. You an d your fam ily all ate the gam e.\" His statements carried the conviction of someone who had been there. He was, of course, right. There had been times when I had provided the inciden tal wild meat for my fam ily. After a moment's hesitation I asked, \"How did you know that?\" \"There are certain things that I just know, \" he said. \"I can 't tell you how though.\" I told him that my au nts an d uncles would very seriously call all the birds I w ould bag \"pheasan ts.\""},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 Don Juan said he could easily imagine them calling a sparrow a \"tiny pheasan t\" an d ad ded a comical rendition of how they would chew it. The extrao rdinary movements of his jaw gav e me the feeling that he was actually chewing a whole bi rd, bones an d all. \"I really think that you hav e a touch for hunting, \" he said, staring at me. \"And we hav e been barking up the wrong tree. Perhap s you will be willing to chan ge your way of life in order to become a hunter.\" He reminded me that I had foun d out, with just a little exertion on my part, that in the world there were good an d bad spots for me; he ad ded that I had also found out the specific colors associated with them. \"That mean s that you hav e a knack for hunting, \" he declared. \"Not everyone who tries would find their colors an d their spots at the sam e time.\" To be a hunter sounded very nice an d roman tic, but it was an ab surdity to me, since I did not particularly care to hunt. \"You don't hav e to care to hunt or to like it, \" he replied to my complaint. \"You hav e a natural inclination. I think the best hunters never like hunting; they do it well, that's all.\" I had the feeling don Juan was cap able of arguing his way out of an ything, an d yet he maintained that he did not like to talk at all. \"It is like what I hav e told you ab out hunters, \" he said. \"I don't necessarily like to talk. I just hav e a knack for it an d I do it well, that's all.\" I found his mental agility truly funny. \"Hunters must be exceptionally tight individuals, \" he continued. \" A hunter leav es very little to chan ce.

I reminded him that in the beginning I had just wan ted him to tell me ab out medicinal plan ts, but he had made me stray so far aw ay from my original pu rpose that I could not clearly recall an y more whether or not I had really wan ted to learn ab out plan ts. \"Good, \" he said. \"Really good. If you don't hav e such a clear picture of what you wan t, you may become more humble. \"Let's put it this way.

Don Juan chuckled, obviously aw are of his control over the situation. \"I am a hunter, \" he said, as if he were reading my thoughts. \"I leav e very little to chan ce.

He first explained an d then corroborated a number of hunting tactics based on what he called \"the qu irks of qu ails.\" I becam e so utterly involved in hi s explan ations that a whole day went by an d I had not noticed the passag e of time. I even forgot to eat lunch. Don Juan made joking remarks that it was qu ite unusual for me to miss a meal. By the end of the day he had cau ght five qu ail in a most ingenious trap , which he had tau ght me to assemble an d set up. \"Two are enough for us, \" he said an d let three of them loose. He then tau ght me how to roast qu ail. I had wan ted to cut some shrubs an d mak e a barbecue pit, the way my gran dfather used to mak e it, lined with green bran ches an d leav es an d sealed with dirt, but don Juan said that there was no need to injure the shrubs, since we had alread y injured the qu ail. After we finished eating we walked very leisurely towards a rocky area. We sat on a san dstone hills ide an d I said jokingly that if he would hav e left the matter up to me I would hav e cooked all five of the qu ail, an d that my barbecue would hav e tasted much better than his roast. \"No doubt, \" he said. \"But if you would hav e done all that we might hav e ne ver left this place in one piece.\" \"Wh at do you mean ?\" I asked. \"Wh at would hav e prevented us?\" \"The shrubs, the qu ail, everything around would hav e pitched in.\" \"I never know when you are talking seriously, \" I said. He mad e a gesture of feigned impatienc e an d smacked his lips. \"You hav e a weird notion of what it mean s to talk seriously, \" he said. \"I lau gh a great deal becau se I like to lau gh yet everything I say is dead ly serious, even if you don't understan d it. Wh y should the world be only as you think it is? Wh o gav e you the au thority to say so?\" \"There is no proof that the world is otherwise, \" I said. It was getting dark. I was wondering if it was time to go back to his house, but he did not seem to be in a hurry an d I was enjoying myself. The wind w as cold. Suddenly he stood up an d told me that we had to climb to the hilltop an d stan d up on an area clear of shrubs. \"Don't be afraid, \" he said. \"I'm your friend an d I'll see that nothing bad hap pens to you.\""},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 \"Wh at do you mean ?\" I asked, alarmed. Don Ju an had the most insidious facility to shift me from sheer enjoyment to sheer fright. \"The world is very stran ge at this time of the day , \" he said. \"That's what I mean . No matter what you see, don't be afraid.\" \"Wh at am I going to see?\" \"I don't know yet, \" he said, peering into the distan ce towards the south. He did not seem to be worried. I also kept on looking in the sam e direction. Suddenly he perked up an d pointed with his left han d towards a dark area in the desert shrubbery. \"There it is, \" he said, as if he had been waiting for something which had suddenly ap peared. \"Wh at is it?\" I asked. \"There it is, \" he repeated. \"Look! Look!\" I did not see an ything, just the shrubs. \"It is here now, \" he said with great urgency in his voice. \"It is here.\" A sudd en gust of wind hit me at that instan t and mad e my eyes burn. I stared towards the area in qu estion. There was ab solutely nothing out of the ordinary. \"I can 't see a thing, \" I said. \"You just felt it, \" he replied. \"Right now. It got into your eyes an d ke pt you from seeing.\" \"Wh at are you talking ab out?\" \"I hav e deliberately brought you to a hilltop, \" he said. \"We are very noticeab le here an d something is coming to us.\" \"Wh at? The wind?\" \"Not just the wind, \" he said sternly. \"It may seem to be wind to yo u, becau se wind is all you know.\" I strained my eyes staring into the desert shrubs. Don Juan stood silently by me for a moment an d then walked into the nearby chaparral an d began to tear some big bran ches"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 from the surrounding shrubs; he gathered eight of them an d mad e a bundle. He ordered me to do the sam e an d to ap ologize to the plants in a loud voice for mutilating them. Wh en we had two bundles he made me run with them to the hilltop an d lie down on my back between two large rocks. Wi th tremendous speed he arran ged the bran ches of my bundle to cover my entire body, then he covered himself in the sam e man ner an d whispered through the leav es that I should watch how the so - called wind would cease to blow once we had become unnoticeab le. At one moment, to my utter am aze ment, the wind actually ceased to blow as don Juan had predicted. It hap pened so grad ually that I would hav e missed the chan ge had I not been deliberately waiting for it. For a while the wind had hissed through the leav es over my face an d then g rad ually it becam e qu iet all around us. I whispered to don Juan that the wind had stopped an d he whispered back that I should not mak e an y overt noise or movement, becau se what I was calling the wind was not wind at all but something that had a volition of its own an d could actually recognize us. I lau ghed out of nervousness. In a muffled voice don Juan called my attention to the qu ietness around us an d whispered that he was going to stan d up an d I should follow him, putting the bran ches aside very gently w ith my left han d. We stood up at the sam e time. Don Juan stared for a moment into the distan ce towards the south an d then turned around - ab ruptly an d faced the west. \"Sneak y. Really sneak y, \" he muttered, pointing to an area towards the southwest. \"Look! Lo ok!\" he urged me. I stared with all the intensity I was cap ab le of. I wan ted to see whatever he was referring to, but I did not notice an ything at all. Or rather I did not notice an ything I had not seen before; there were just shrubs which seemed to be ag i tated by a soft wind; they rippled. \"It's here, \" don Juan said. At that moment I felt a blast of air in my face. It seemed that the wind had actually begun to blow after we stood up. I could not believe it; there had to be a logical explan ation for it. Do n Juan chuckled softly an d told me not to tax my brain trying to reason it out. \"Let's go gather the shrubs once more, \" he said. \"I hate to do this to these little plan ts, but we must stop you.\" He picked up the bran ches we had used to cover ourselves an d piled small rocks an d dirt over them. Then, repeating the sam e movements we had mad e before, each of us"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 gathered eight new bran ches. In the mean time the wind kept on blowing ceaselessly. I could feel it ruffling the hair around my ears. Don Juan whispered that once he had covered me I should not mak e the slightest movement or sound. He very qu ickly put the bran ches over my body an d then he lay down an d covered himself. We stay ed in that position for ab out twenty minutes an d during that time a most extrao rd inary phenomenon occurred; the wind ag ain chan ged from a hard continuous gust to a mild vibration. I held my breath, waiting for don Juan 's signal. At a given moment he gently shoved off the bran ches. I did the sam e an d we stood up. The hilltop was very qu iet. There was only a slight, soft vibration of leav es in the surrounding chap arral. Don Juan 's eyes were fixedly staring at an area in the shrubs south of us. \"There it is ag ain!\" he exclaimed in a loud voice. I involuntarily jumped, nearly losing my bala nce, an d he ordered me in a loud imperative voice to look. \"Wh at am I supposed to see?\" I asked desperately. He said that it, the wind or whatever, was like a cloud or a whorl that was qu ite a way s ab ove the shrubs, twirling its way to the hilltop where we were. I saw a ripple forming on the bushes in the distan ce. \"There it comes, \" don Juan said in my ear. \"Look how it is searching for us.\" Right then a strong stead y gust of wind hit my face, as it had hit it before. This time, however, my reaction was di fferent. I was terrified. I had not seen what don Juan had described, but I had seen a most eerie wav e rippling the shrubs. I did not wan t to succumb to my fear an d deliberately sought an y kind of suitab le explan ation. I said to myself that there must be c ontinuous air currents in the area, an d don Juan , being thoroughly acqu ainted with the whole region, was not only aw are of that but was cap ab le of mentally plotting their occurrence. All he had to do was to lie down, count, an d wait for the wind to tap er o ff; an d once he stood up he had only to wait ag ain for its reoccurrence. Don Juan 's voice shook me out of my mental deliberations. He was telling me that it was time to leav e. I stalled; I wan ted to stay to mak e sure that the wind would tap er off. \"I didn' t see an ything, don Juan , \" I said. \"You noticed something unusual though.\" \"Perhap s you should tell me ag ain what I was supposed to see.\" \"I've already told you, \" he said. \"Something that hides in the wind an d looks like a whorl, a cloud, a mist, a face that twirls around.\""},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 Don Juan mad e a gesture with his han ds to depict a horizo ntal an d a vertical motion. \"It moves in a specific direction, \" he went on. \"It either tumbles or it twirls. A hunter must know all that in order to move correctly.\" I wanted to humor him, but he seemed to be trying so hard to mak e his point that I did not dare. He looked at me for a moment an d I moved my eyes aw ay . \"To believe that the world is only as you think it is, is stupid, \" he said. \"The world is a mysterious place. Espe cially in the twilight.\" He pointed towards the wind with a movement of his chin. \"This can follow us, \" he said. \"It can mak e us tired or it might even kill us.\" \"That wind?\" \"At this time of the day , in the twilight, there is no wind. At this time there is only power.\" We sat on the hilltop for an hour. The wind blew hard an d constan tly all that time. Friday, June 30, 1961 In the late afternoon, after eating, don Juan an d I moved to the area in front of his door. I sat on my \"spot\" an d began working on m y notes. He lay down on his back with his han ds folded over his stomach. We had stay ed around the house all day on account of the \"wind.\" Don Juan explained that we had disturbed the wind deliberately an d that it was better not to fool around with it. I ha d even had to sleep covered with bran ches. A sudden gust of wind mad e don Juan get up in one incredibly agile jump. \"Dam n it, \" he said. \"The wind is looking for you.\" \"I can 't buy that, don Juan , \" I said, lau ghing. \"I really can 't.\" I was not being stubb orn, I just found it impossible to endorse the idea that the wind had its own volition an d was looking for me, or that it had actually spotted us an d rushed to us on top of the hill. I said that the idea of a \"willful wind\" was a view of the world that was rather simplistic. \"Wh at is the wind then?\" he asked in a challenging tone. I patiently explained to him that masses of hot an d cold air produced different pressures an d that the pressure mad e the masses of air move vertically an d horizo ntally. It took me a long while to explain all the details of basic meteorology. \"You mean that all there is to the wind is hot and cold air?\" he asked in a tone of bafflement. \"I'm afraid so, \" I said an d silently enjoyed my triumph. Don Juan seemed to be dumbfounded. But then he looked at me an d began to lau gh uproariously."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 \"Your opinions are final opinions, \" he said with a note of sarcasm. \"They are the last word, aren't they? For a hunter, however, your opinions are pure crap . It mak es no difference whether the pressure is one or two or ten; if you would live out here in the wilderness you would know that during the twilight the wind becomes power. A hunter that is worth his salt knows that, an d acts accordingly.\" \"How does he act?\" \"He uses the twilight an d that power h idden in the wind.\" \"How?\" \"If it is convenient to him, the hunter hides from the power by covering himself an d remaining motionless until the twilight is gone an d the power has sealed him into its protection.\" Don Juan mad e a gesture of enveloping somethi ng with his han ds. \"Its protection is like a ...\" He pau sed in search of a word an d I suggested \"cocoon.\" \"That is right, \" he said. \"The protection of the power seals you like in a cocoon. A hunter can stay out in the open an d no puma or coyote or slimy b ug could bother him. A mountain lion could come up to the hunter's nose an d sniff him, an d if the hunter does not move, the lion would leav e. I can guaran tee you that. \"If the hunter, on the other han d, wan ts to be noticed all he has to do is to stan d on a hilltop at the time of the twilight an d the power will nag him an d seek him all night. Therefore, if a hunter wan ts to trav el at night or if he wan ts to be kept aw ak e he must mak e himself av ailab le to the wind. \"Therein lies the secret of great hunters. T o be av ailab le an d unav ailable at the precise turn of the road .\" I felt a bit confused an d asked him to recap itulate his point. Don Juan very patiently explained that he had used the twilight an d the wind to point out the crucial importan ce of the interpla y between hiding an d showing oneself. \"You must learn to become deliberately av ailable an d unav ailab le, \" he said. \"As your life goes now, you are unwittingly av ailable at all times.\" I protested. My feeling was that my life was becoming increasingly more an d more secretive. He said I had not understood his point, an d that to be unav ailab le did not mean to hide or to be secretive but to be inaccessible. \"Let me put it in an other way, \" he proceeded patiently. \"It mak es no difference to hide if everyone know s that you are hiding."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 \"Your problems right now stem from that. Wh en you are hiding, everyone knows that you are hiding, an d when you are not, you are av ailable for everyone to tak e a poke at you.\" I was beginning to feel threatened an d hurriedly tried to defend myself. \"Don't explain yourself, \"don Juan said dryly. \"There is no need. We are fools, all of us, an d you can not be different. At one time in my life I, like you, mad e myself av ailable over an d over ag ain until there was nothing of me left for an yt hing except perhap s crying. And that I did, just like yourself.\" Don Juan sized me up for a moment an d then sighed loudly. \"I was younger than you, though, \" he went on, \"but one day I had enough an d I chan ged. Let's say that one day, when I was becoming a hunter, I learned the secret of being av ailab le an d unav ailab le.\" I told him that his point was bypassing me. I truly could not understan d what he mean t by being av ailable. He had used the Span ish idioms \"ponerse al alcan ce\" an d \"ponerse en el del cam ino, \"to put oneself within reach, an d to put oneself in the middle of a trafficked way . \"You must tak e yourself aw ay , \" he explained. \"You must retrieve yourself from the middle of a trafficked way . Your whole being is there, thus it is of no use to hide; you would only imag ine that you are hidden. Being in the middle of the road mean s that everyone passing by watches your comings and goings.\" His metap hor was interesting, but at the sam e time it was also obscure. \"You are talking in riddles, \" I said. He star ed at me fixedly for a long moment an d then began to hum a tune. I straightened my back an d sat attentively. I knew that when don Juan hummed a Mexican tune he was ab out to clobber me. \"Hey, \" he said, smiling, an d peered at me. \"Whatever hap pened to your blond friend? That girl that you used to really like.\" I must hav e looked at him like a confounded idiot. He lau ghed with great delight. I did not know what to say . \"You told me about her, \" he said reassuringly. \"But I did not remember ever telling him ab out an ybody, much less ab out a blond girl. \"I've never mentioned an ything like that to you, \" I said. \"Of course you hav e, \" he said as if dismissing the argument. I wan ted to protest, but he stopped me, say ing that it did not matter how he knew ab out her, that the importan t issue was that I had liked her. I sensed a surge of an imosity towards him building up within myself."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 \"Don't stall, \" don Juan said dryly. \"This is a time when you should cut off your feelings of importan ce. \"You once had a woman , a ver y dear woman , an d then one day you lost her.\" I began to wonder if I had ever talked ab out her to don. Juan . I concluded that there had never been an opportunity. Yet I might hav e. Every time he drove with me we had alway s talked incessan tly ab out everythi ng. I did not remember everything we had talked ab out becau se I could not tak e notes while driving. I felt somehow ap peased by my conclusions. I told him that he was right. There had been a very importan t blond girl in my life. \"Wh y isn't she with you?\" h e asked. \"She left.\" \"Wh y?\" \"There were man y reasons;\" \"There were not so man y reasons. There was only one. You mad e yourself too av ailab le.\" I earnestly wan ted to know what he mean t. He ag ain had touched me. He seemed to be cognizan t of the effect of his touch an d puckered up his lips to hide a mischievous smile. \"Everyone knew about you two, \" he said with unshak en conviction. \"Was it wrong?\" \"It was dead ly wrong. She was a fine person.\" I expressed the sincere feeling that his fishing in the dark was odi ous to me, especially the fact that he alway s mad e his statements with the assuran ce of someone who had been at the scene an d had seen it all. \"But that's true, \" he said with a disarming can dor. \"I hav e seen it all. She was a fine person.\" I knew that it was mean ingless to argue, but I was an gry with him for touching that sore spot in my life an d I said that the girl in question was not such a fine person after all, that in my opinion she was rather weak . \"So are you, \" he said calmly. \"But that is not imp ortan t. Wh at counts is that you hav e looked for her everywhere; that mak es her a special person in your world, an d for a special person one should hav e only fine words.\""},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 6 1 I felt embarrassed; a great sad ness had begun to engulf me. \"Wh at are you doing to me, don Juan ?\" I asked. \"You always succeed in mak ing me sad .

Not the way you did. You stay ed with her day after day , until the only feeling that remained was boredom. True?\" I did not an swer. I felt I did not hav e to. He was right. \"To be inaccessible mean s that you touch the world around you sparingly. You don't eat five qu ail; you eat one. You don't dam ag e the plan ts just to ma ke a barbecue pit. You don't expose yourself to the power of the wind unless it is man datory. You don't use an d squ eeze people until they hav e shriveled to nothing, especially the people you love.\" \"I hav e never used an yone, \" I said sincerely. But don Jua n maintained that I had , an d thus I could bluntly state that I becam e tired an d bored with people. \"To be unav ailable mean s that you deliberately av oid exhau sting yourself an d others, \" he continued. \"It mean s that you are not hungry an d desperate, like th e poor bastard that feels he will never eat ag ain an d devours all the food he can , all five qu ail!\" Don Juan was definitely hitting me below the belt. I lau ghed an d that seemed to please him. He touched my back lightly. \"A hunter knows he will lure gam e in to his trap s over an d over ag ain, so he doesn't worry.

My point was that in order to function I had to be within reach of everyone that had something to do with me. \"I've told you alread y that to be inaccess ible does not mean to hide or to be secretive, \" he said calmly. \"It doesn't mean that you can not deal with people either. A hunter uses his world sparingly an d with tenderness, regardless of whether the world might be things, or plan ts, or an imals, or peo ple, or power.

He pointed out that they were very fast in getting out of dan ger, but after they had outrun an y predator they had the terrible hab it of stopping, or even climbing a rock, to stan d on their hind legs to look around an d groom themselves. \"They hav e very good eyes, \" don Juan said. \"You must move only when they are on the run, therefore, you must learn to predict when an d where they will stop, so you wou ld also stop at the sam e time.\" I becam e engrossed in observing them an d I had what would hav e been a field day for hunters as I spotted so man y of them. And finally I could predict their movements almost every time. Don Juan then showed me how to mak e tra ps to catch them. He explained that a hunter had to tak e time to observe their eating or their nesting places in order to determine where to locate his trap s; he would then set them during the night an d all he had to do the next day was to scare them off s o they would scatter aw ay into his catching devices. We gathered some sticks an d proceeded to build the hunting contrap tions. I had mine almost finished an d was excitedly wondering whether or not it would work when suddenly don Juan stopped an d looked at h is left wrist, as if he were checking a watch which he had never had , an d said that according to his timepiece it was lunchtime. I was holding a long stick, which I was trying to make into a hoop by bending it in a circle. I au tomatically put it down with the rest of my hunting parap hernalia. Don Juan looked at me with an expression of curiosity. Then he made the wailing sound of a factory siren at lunch time. I lau ghed. His siren sound was perfect. I walked towards him an d noticed that he was staring at me . He shook his head from side to side. \"I'll be dam ned, \" he said. \"Wh at's wrong?\" I asked. He ag ain mad e the long wailing sound of a factory whistle. \"Lunch is over, \" he said. \"Go back to work.\" I felt confused for an instan t, but then I thought that he was joking, perhap s becau se we really had nothing to mak e lunch with. I had been so engrossed with the rodents that I had forgotten we had no provisions. I picked up the stick ag ain an d tried to bend it. After a moment don Juan again blew his \"whistle.\" \"T ime to go home, \" he said. He exam ined his imag inary watch an d then looked at me an d winked."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 \"It's five o'clock, \" he said with an air of someone revealing a secret. I thought that he had suddenly become fed up with hunting an d was calling the whole thing off. I simply put everything down an d began to get ready to leav e. I did not look at him. I presumed that he also was preparing his gear. Wh en I was through I looked up an d saw him sitting crosslegged a few feet aw ay . \"I'm through, \" I said. \"We can go an y time.\" He got up an d climbed a rock. He stood there, five or six feet ab ove the ground, looking at me. He put his han ds on either side of his mouth an d made a very prolonged an d piercing sound. It was like a mag nified factory siren. He turned around in a c omplete circle, mak ing the wailing sound. \"Wh at are you doing, don Juan ?\" I asked. He said that he was giving the signal for the whole world to go home. I was completely baffled. I could not figure out whether he was joking or whether he had simply flipped his lid. I watched him intently an d tried to relate what he was doing to something he may hav e said before. We had hardly talked at all during the morning an d I could not remember an ything of importan ce. Don Juan was still stan ding on top of the rock. He looked at me, smiled an d winked ag ain. I suddenly becam e alarmed. Don Juan put his han ds on both sides of his mouth an d let out an other long whistle - like sound. He said that it was eight o'clock in the morning an d that I had to set up my gear ag ain becau se we had a whole day ah ead of us. I was completely confused by then. In a matter of minutes my fear mounted to an irresistible desire to run aw ay from the scene. I thought don Juan was crazy . I was ab out to flee when he slid down from the rock an d cam e to m e, smiling. \"You think I'm crazy , don't you?\" he asked. I told him that he was frightening me out of my wits with his unexpected behav ior. He said that we were even. I did not understan d what he mean t. I was deeply preoccupied with the thought that his act s seemed thoroughly insan e. He explained that he had deliberately tried to scare me out of my wits with the heav iness of his unexpected behav ior becau se I myself was driving him up the walls with the heav iness of my expected behav ior. He added that my rou tines were as insan e as his blowing his whistle. I was shocked an d asserted that I did not really hav e an y routines. I told him that I believed my life was in fact a mess becau se of my lack of healthy routines. Don Juan lau ghed an d signaled me to sit down by him. The whole situation had mysteriously chan ged ag ain. My fear had van ished as soon as he had begun to talk. \"Wh at are my routines?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 \"Everything you do is a routine.\" \"Aren't we all that way ?\" \"Not all of us.

Your sp irit is trained to work with a signal.\" He stared at me with a qu estion in his eyes. I could not defend myself. \"Now you're getting read y to mak e hunting into a routine, \" He went on. \"You hav e alread y set your pace in hunting, you talk at a certain time, eat at a certain time, an d fall asleep at a certain time.\" I had nothing to say . The way don Juan had described my eating hab its was the pattern I used for everything in my life. Yet I strongly felt that my life was less routine than that of some of my fri ends an d acqu aintan ces. \"You know a great deal about hunting now, \" don Juan continued. \"It'll be easy for you to realize that a good hunter knows one thing ab ove all - he knows the routines of his prey. That's what mak es him a good hunter. \"If you would rem ember the way I hav e proceeded in teaching you hunting, you would perhap s understan d what I mean . First I tau ght you how to mak e an d set up your trap s, then I tau ght you the routines of the game you were after, an d then we tested the trap s ag ainst their ro utines. Those parts are the outside forms of hunting. \"Now I hav e to teach you the final, an d by far the most difficult, part. Perhap s years will pass before you can say that you understan d it an d that you're a hunter.\" Don Juan pau sed as if to give me tim e. He took off his hat an d imitated the grooming movements of the rodents we had been observing. It was very funny to me. His round head mad e him look like one of those rodents."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66 \"To be a hunter is not just to trap gam e, \" he went on. \"A hunter that is wort h his salt does not catch gam e becau se he sets his trap s, or becau se he knows the routines of his prey, but becau se he himself has no routines. This is his advan tag e. He is not at all like the an imals he is after, fixed by heav y routines an d predictab le qu irks; he is free, fluid, unpredictab le.\" Wh at don Juan was say ing sounded to me like an arbitrary an d irrational idealizat ion. I could not conceive of a life without routines. I wan ted to be very honest with him an d not just ag ree or disag ree with him. I f elt that what he had in mind was not possible to accomplish by me or by an yone. \"I don't care how you feel, \" he said. \"In order to be a hunter you must disrupt the routines of your life. You hav e done well in hunting. You hav e learned qu ickly an d now you can see that you are like your prey, easy to predict.\" I asked him to be specific an d give me concrete exam ples. \"I am talking ab out hunting, \" he said calmly. \"Therefore I am concerned with the things an imals do; the places they eat; the place, the man ner , the time they sleep; where they nest; how they walk. These are the routines I am pointing out to you so you can become aw are of them in your own being. \"You hav e observed the habits of an imals in the desert. They eat or drink at certain places, they nest at specific spots, they leav e their tracks in specific way s; in fact, everything they do can be foreseen or reconstructed by a good hunter. \"As I told you before, in my eyes you behav e like your prey. Once in my life someone pointed out the sam e thing to me, so you're not uniqu e in that. All of us behav e like the prey we are after. That, of course, also makes us prey for something or someone else. Now, the concern of a hunter, who knows all this, is to stop being a prey himself. Do you see what I mean ?\" I ag ain expressed the opinion that his proposition was unattainab le. \"It tak es time, \" don Juan said. \"You could begin by not eating lunch every single day at twelve o'clock.\" He looked at me an d smiled benevolently. His expression was very funny an d mad e m e lau gh. \"There are certain an imals, however, that are impossible to track, \" he went on. \"There are certain types of deer, for instan ce, which a fortunate hunter might be ab le to come across, by sheer luck, once in his lifetime.\" Don Juan pau sed dram atica lly an d looked at me piercingly. He seemed to be waiting for a qu estion, but I did not hav e an y. \"Wh at do you think mak es them so difficult to find an d so uniqu e?\" he asked. I shrugged my shoulders becau se I did not know what to say . \"They hav e no routines , \" he said in a tone of revelation. \"That's what mak es them mag ical.\" \"A deer has to sleep at night, \" I said. \"Isn't that a routine?\""},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 \"Certainly, if the deer sleeps every night at a specific time an d in one specific place. But those mag ical beings do not behav e like that. In fact, someday you may verify this for yourself. Perhap s it'll be your fate to chase one of them for the rest of your life.\" \"Wh at do you mean by that?\" \"You like hunting; perhap s someday , in some place in the world, your path may cros s the path of a mag ical being an d you might go after it. \"A mag ical being is a sight to behold. I was fortunate enough to cross paths with one. Our encounter took place after I had learned and practiced a great deal of hunting. Once I was in a forest of th ick trees in the mountains of central Mexico when suddenly I heard a sweet whistle. It was unknown to me; never in all my years of roam ing in the wilderness had I heard such a sound. I could not place it in the terrain; it seemed to come from different pla ces. I thought that perhap s I was surrounded by a herd or a pack of some unknown an imals. \"I heard the tan talizing whistle once more; it seemed to come from everywhere. I realized then my good fortune. I knew it was a mag ical being, a deer. I also knew tha t a mag ical deer is aware of the routines of ordinary men an d the routines of hunters. \"It is very easy to figure out what an av erag e man would do in a situation like that. First of all his fear would immediately turn him into a prey. Once he becomes a pre y he has two courses of action left. He either flees or he mak es his stan d. If he is not armed he would ordinarily flee into the open field to run for his life. If he is armed he would get his weap on read y an d would then mak e his stan d either by freezing o n the spot or by dropping to the ground. \"A hunter, on the other han d, when he stalks in the wilderness would never walk into an y place without figuring out his points of protection, therefore he would immediately tak e cover. He might drop his poncho on th e ground or he might han g it from a bran ch as a decoy an d then he would hide an d wait until the gam e mak es its next move. \"So, in the presence of the mag ical deer I didn't behav e like either. I qu ickly stood on my head an d began to wail softly; I actually wept tears an d sobbed for such a long time that I was ab out to faint. Suddenly I felt a soft breeze; something was sniffing my hair behind my right ear. I tried to turn my head in sec what it was, an d I tumbled down an d sat up in time to see a rad ian t crea ture staring at me. The deer looked at me an d I told him I would not harm him. And the deer talked to me. Don Juan stopped an d looked at me. I smiled involuntarily. The idea of a talking deer was qu ite incredible, to put it mildly. \"He talked to me, \" don Juan said with a grin. \"The deer talked?\" \"He did.\" Don Juan stood an d picked up his bundle of hunting parap hernalia. \"Did it really talk?\" I asked in a tone of perplexity."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 Don Juan roared with lau ghter. \"Wh at did it say ?\" I asked half in jest. I thought h e was pulling my leg. Don Juan was qu iet for a moment, as if he were trying to remember, then his eyes brightened as he told me what the deer had said. \"The mag ical deer said, 'Hello friend.', don Juan went on. \"And I an swered, 'Hello.' Then he asked me, ' Wh y are you crying?' an d I said, 'Becau se I'm sad .' Then the mag ical creature cam e to my ear an d said as clearly as I am speak ing now, 'Don't be sad .'\" Don Juan stared into my eyes. He had a glint of sheer mischievous ness. He began to lau gh uproariously. I said that his dialogue with the deer had been sort of dumb. \"Wh at did you expect?\" he asked, still lau ghing. \"I'm an Indian .\" His sense of humor was so outlan dish that all I could do was lau gh with him. \"You don't believe that a mag ical deer talks, do yo u?\" \"I'm sorry but I just can 't believe things like that can hap pen, \" I said. \"I don't blam e you, \" he said reassuringly. \"It's one of the darndest things.\" "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 THE LAST BATTLE ON EARTH Monday , July 24, 1961 Around mid - afternoon, after we had roam ed for ho urs in the desert, don Juan chose a place to rest in a shaded area. As soon as we sat down he began talking. He said that I had learned a great deal about hunting, but I had not chan ged as much as he had wished. \"It's not enough to know how to mak e an d set up trap s, \" he said. \"A hunter must live as a hunter in order to draw the most out of his life. Unfortunately, chan ges are difficult an d hap pen very slowly; sometimes it tak es years for a man to become convinced of the need to chan ge. It took me years, bu t may be I didn't hav e a knack for hunting. I think for me the most difficult thing was to really wan t to chan ge.\" I assured him that I understood his point. In fact, since he had begun to teach me how to hunt I also had begun to reassess my actions. Perhap s the most dram atic discovery for me was that I liked don Juan 's way s. I liked don Juan as a person. There was something solid about his behav ior; the way he conducted himself left no doubts ab out his mastery, an d yet He had never exercised his advan tag e t o deman d an ything from me. His interest in chan ging my way of life, I felt, was akin to an impersonal suggestion, or perhap s it was ak in to an au thoritative commentary on my failures. He had mad e me very aw are of my failings, yet I could not see how his wa ys would remedy an ything in me. I sincerely believed that, in light of what I wan ted to do in my life, his way s would hav e only brought me misery an d hardship, hence the impasse. However, I had learned to respect his mastery, which had alway s been expresse d in terms of beau ty an d precision. \"I hav e decided to shift my tactics, \" he said. I asked him to explain; his statement was vag ue an d I was not sure whether or not he was referring to me. \"A good hunter chan ges his way s as often as he needs, \" he replied . \"You know that yourself.\" \"Wh at do you hav e in mind, don Juan ?\" \"A hunter must not only know about the hab its of his prey, he also must know that there are powers on this earth that guide men an d an imals an d everything that is living.\" He stopped talking . I waited but he seemed to hav e come to the end of what he wan ted to say . \"Wh at kind of powers are you talking ab out?\" I asked after a long pau se. \"Powers that guide our lives an d our deaths.\" Don Juan stopped talking an d seemed to be hav ing tremendous di fficulty in deciding what to say . He rubbed his han ds an d shook his head , puffing out his jaws. Twice he signaled me to be qu iet as I started to ask him to explain his cryptic statements."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 \"You won't be ab le to stop yourself easily, \" he finally said. \"I kn ow that you're stubborn, but that doesn't matter.

You just said that becau se it soun ds good to you; in fact, you've been say ing the sam e thing ab out everything you do. You've been trying your best for years to no av ail. Something must be done to remedy that.\" I felt compelled, as usual, to defend myself. Don Juan seemed to aim, as a rule, at my very weak est points. I remembered then that every time I had attempted to defend myself ag ainst his criticisms I had ended up feeling like a fool, an d I stopped myself in the midst of a long explan atory speech. Don Juan exam ined me with curiosity an d lau ghed. He said in a very kind tone that he had already told me that all of us were fools. I was not an exception. \"You alway s feel compelled to explain your acts, as if you were the only man on earth who's wrong, \" he said. \"It's your old feeling of i mportan ce. You hav e too much of it; you also hav e too much personal history. On the other han d, you don't assume responsibility for your acts; you're not using your death as an ad viser, an d ab ove all, you are too accessible. In other words, your life is as messy as it was before I met you.\" Again I had a genuine surge of pride an d wan ted to argue that he was wrong. He gestured me to be qu iet. \"One must assume responsibility for being in a weird world, \" he said. \"We are in a weird world, you know.\" I nodded my head affirmatively. \"We 're not talking ab out the sam e thing, \" he said. \"For you the world is weird becau se if you're not bored with it you're at odds with it. For me the world is weird becau se it is stupendous, aw esome, mysterious, unfathomab le; my in terest has been to convince you that you must assume responsibility for being here, in this marvelous world, in this marvelous desert, in this marvelous time. I wan ted to convince you that you must learn to mak e every act count, since you are going to be h ere for only a short while, in fact, too short for witnessing all the marvels of it.\" I insisted that to be bored with the world or to be at odds with it was the human condition. \"So, chan ge it, \" he replied dryly. \"If you do not respond to that challenge you are as good as dead .\" He dared me to nam e an issue, an item in my life that had engag ed all my thoughts. I said art. I had alway s wan ted to be an artist and for years I had tried my han d at that. I still had the painful memory of my failure. \"You hav e never tak en the responsibility for being in this unfathomab le world, \" he said in an indicting tone. \"Therefore, you were never an artist, an d perhap s you'll never be a hunter.\""},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 \"This is my best, don Juan .\" \"No. You don't know what your best is.\" \"I am doi ng all I can .\" \"You're wrong ag ain.

However, I didn't like my life; I was tired of it, just like you. Now I don't hav e enough of it.\" I vehemently asserted that his insistence ab out chan ging my wa y of life was frightening an d arbitrary. I said that I really agreed with him, at a certain level, but the mere fact that he was alway s the master that called the shots mad e the situation untenab le for me. \"You don't hav e time for this display , you fool, \" he said in a severe tone. \"This, whatever you're doing now, may be your last act on earth.

Don Juan lau ghed an d said I was like a comedian going m echan ically through a routine. \"If this were your last battle on earth, I would say that you are an idiot, \" he said calmly. \"You are wasting your last act on earth in some stupid mood.\" We were qu iet for a moment.

Yet, perhap s you will surprise yourself someday by chan ging suddenly an d without a single wa rning. I know this is so, an d thus I don't lose sight of my interest in convincing you.\" I could not persist in my arguing. I was not sure of what I really wan ted to say . After a moment's pau se don Juan went on explaining his point. \"Perhap s I should put i t in a different way , \" he said. \"Wh at I recommend you to do is to notice that we do not hav e an y assuran ce that our lives will go on indefinitely.

But do you know an yone who lives happily?\" My first impulse was to say yes; I thought I could use a number of people I knew as exam ples. On second thought, however, I knew my effort would only be an empty attempt at exonerating myself. \"No, \" I said. \"I really don't.\" \"I do, \" don Juan said. \"There are some people who are very careful abou t the nature of their acts. Their hap piness is to act with the full knowledge that they don't hav e time; therefore, their acts hav e a peculiar power; their acts hav e a sense of . . .\" Don Juan seemed to be at a loss for words.

He smiled an d patted me on the back. Two weeks before, on August 4th, don Juan , as he had said, chan ged his tactics with me an d allowed me to ingest some peyote buttons. During the h eight of my hallucinatory experience I played with a dog that lived in the house where the peyote session took place. Don Juan interpreted my interaction with the dog as a very special event. He contended that at moments of power, such as the one I had bee n living then, the world of ordinary affairs did not exist an d nothing could be tak en for gran ted, that the dog was not really a dog but the incarnation of Mescalito, the power or deity contained in peyote. The post - effects of that experience were a genera l sense of fatigue an d melan choly, plus the incidence of exceptionally vivid dreams an d nightmares. \"Wh ere's your writing gear?\" don Juan asked as I sat down on the porch. I had left my notebooks in my car. Don Juan walked back to the car an d carefully pul led out my briefcase an d brought it to my side. He asked if I usually carried my briefcase when I walked.

The idea of carrying my notes in a knap sack was ludicrous. I told him that ordinarily I wore a suit an d a knap sack over a three - piece suit would be a preposterous sight. \"Put your coat on over the knap sack,\" he said. \"It is better that people think you're a hunchback than to ruin your body carrying all this around.\" He urged me to get out my notebook an d write. He seemed to be mak ing a deliberate effort to put me at ease. I complained ag ain about the feeling of physical discomfort an d the stran ge sense of unhap piness I was experiencing. Don Juan laughed an d said, \"You're beginning to learn.\" We then had a long conversation. He said that Mescalito, by allowing me to play with him, had pointed me out as a \"chosen man \" and that, although he was baffled by the omen becau se I was not an Indian , he was going to pass on to me some secret knowledge. He said that he had had a \"benefactor\" himself, who tau ght him how to become a \"man of knowledge.\" I sensed that something dread ful was about to hap pen.

I must warn you, though, learning how to hunt has not mad e you into a hunter, nor would learning how to become a warrior mak e you one.\" I experienced a sense of frustration, a physical discomfort that bordered on an guish .

Let them pass, \" he said. \"Now it's time for you to become accessible to power, an d you are going to begin by tackling dream ing.\" The tone of voice he used when he said \"dreaming\" made me think that he was using the word in a very particular fashion. I was pondering about a proper qu estion to ask when he began to talk ag ain. \"I've never told you ab out dream ing, becau se until now I was only concerned with teaching you how to be a hunter, \" he said. \"A hunter is not concern ed with the man ipulation of power, therefore his dream s are only dream s. They might be poignan t but they are not dream ing. \"A warrior, on the other han d, seeks power, and one of the av enues to power is dream ing. You may say that the difference between a hu nter an d a warrior is that a warrior is on his way to power, while a hunter knows nothing or very little ab out it. \"The decision as to who can be a warrior an d who can only be a hunter is not up to us. That decision is in the realm of the powers that guide men. That's why your play ing with Mescalito was such an importan t omen.

His statements were insan e an d yet he was, t o the best of my knowledge, one of the most level - headed men I had ever met. I told him that I could not believe he took his dream s to be reality. He chuckled as if he knew the mag nitude of my untenab le position, then he stood up without say ing a word an d walked inside his house.

I could not, however, even if I stretched myself beyond my limits, a ccept his premise. He seemed to be delighted with my despair. As soon as we had finished eating he casually stated that we were going to go for a hike, but we were not going to roam in the desert in the man ner we had done before. \"It's different this time, \" he said. \"From now on we're going to places of power; you're going to learn how to mak e yourself accessible to power.\" I again expressed my turmoil.

We walked for qu ite a distan ce into a can yon until d on Juan cam e to a halt an d sat down in the shad e of some boulders.

I was dying to know what he mean t by that an d tried to whisper a qu estion, but he reminded me, with a cold severe look, that he mean t business. We sat on his porch for hours.

We reached some mild slopes first an d then we climbed to the top of some high hills. There, don Juan picked out a spot to rest in the open unshad ed area. He told me that we had to wait until dusk , an d that I should conduct myself in the most natural fashion , which included asking all the qu estions I wan ted. \"I know that the spirit is out there lurking, \" he said in a very low voice. \"Wh ere?\" \"Out there, in the bushes.\" \"Wh at kind of spirit is it?\" He looked at me with a qu izzical expression and retorted, \"H ow man y kinds are there?\" We both lau ghed. I was asking qu estions out of nervousness. \"It'll come out at dusk, \" he said. \"We just hav e to wait.\" I remained qu iet.

This is a place of power, an d here we can talk only about power.\" \"I really don't know what power is, \" I said. \"Power is something a warrior deals with, \" he said. \"At first it's an incredible, far - fetched affair; it is hard to even think ab out it. This is what's hap pening to you now. Then power becomes a serious matter; one may not hav e it, or one may not even fully realize that it exists, yet one knows that something is there, something which was not noticeab le before. Next power is man ifested as something uncontrollab le that comes to oneself. It is not possible for me to say how it comes or what it really is.

His tone was so factual that it was as if he were telling me to do something commonpl ace. \"Wh y do you lau gh?\" he asked with surprise. \"How can I look at my han ds in my dream s?\" \"Very simple, focus your eyes on them just like this.\" He bent his head forward an d stared at his han ds with his mouth open.

I brought up the point that in a civilized world there were scores of people who had delusions an d c ould not distinguish what took place in the real world from what took place in their fan tasies.

Don Juan stood up an d gav e furtive glan ces towards the south. \"Let's go, \" he said. \"We must walk so uth until the spirit of the water hole shows itself.\" We walked for perhap s half an hour. The terrain chan ged ab ruptly an d we cam e to a barren area. There was a large round hill where the chap arral had burnt. It looked like a bald head . We walked towards i t. I thought that don Juan was going to climb the mild slope, but he stopped instead an d remained in a very attentive position. His body seemed to hav e tensed as a single unit an d shivered for an instan t. Then he relax ed ag ain an d stood limply. I could not figure out how his body could remain erect while his muscles were so relax ed. At that moment a very strong gust of wind jolted me. Don Juan 's body turned in the direction of the wind, towards the west. He did not use his muscles to turn, or at least he di d not use them the way I would use mine to turn. Don Juan 's body seemed rather to hav e been pulled from the outside. It was as if someone else had arran ged his body to face a new direction. I kept on staring at him. He looked at me from the corner of his e ye. The expression on his face was one of determination, purpose. All of his being was attentive, an d I stared at him in wonder.

He had an other jolt an d then he started to walk as if nothing had hap pened. I followed him. We flan ked the nak ed hills on the east side until we were at the middle part of it; he stopped there, turning to face t he west. From where we stood, the top of the hill was not so round an d smooth as it had seemed to be from the distan ce. There was a cav e, or a hole, near the top. I looked at it fixedly becau se don Juan was doing the sam e. Another strong gust of wind sent a chill up my spine. Don Juan turned towards the south an d scan ned the area with his eyes. \"There!\" he said in a whisper an d pointed to an object on the ground. I strained my eyes to see. There was something on the ground, perhap s twenty feet aw ay . It was light brown an d as I looked at it, it shivered. I focused all my attention on it. The object was almost round an d seemed to be curled; in fact, it looked like a curled up dog. \"Wh at is it?\" I whispered to don Juan . \"I don't know, \" he whispered back as he peered at the object. \"Wh at does it look like to you?\" I told him that it seemed to be a dog. \"Too large for a dog, \" he said matter - of - factly. I took a couple of steps towards it, but don Juan stopped me gently. I stared at it ag ain. It was definitely so me an imal that was either asleep or dead . I could almost see its head ; its ears protruded like the ears of a wolf. By then I was definitely sure that it was a curled - up an imal. I thought that it could hav e been a brown calf. I whispered that to don Juan . H e an swered that it was too compact to be a calf, besides its ears were pointed. The an imal shivered ag ain an d then I noticed that it was alive. I could actually see that it was breathing, yet it did not seem to breathe rhythmically. The breaths that it too k were more like irregular shivers. I had a sudden realizat ion at that moment. \"It's an an imal that is dying, \" I whispered to don Juan . \"You're right, \" he whispered back. \"But what kind of an an imal?\" I could not mak e out its specific features. Don Juan took a couple of cau tious steps towards it. I followed him. It was qu ite dark by then an d we had to tak e two more steps in order to keep the an imal in view. \"Wat ch out, \" don Juan whispered in my ear. \"If it is a dying an imal it may leap on us with its las t strength.\""},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 The an imal, whatever it was, seemed to be on its last legs; its breathing was irregular, its body shook spasmodically, but it did not chan ge its curled - up position.

I heard an inhuman shriek an d the an imal stretched its legs; its claw s were more than frightening, they were nau seating. The an imal tumbled on its side after stretching its legs an d then rolled on its back. I heard a formidab le growl an d don Ju an 's voice shouting, \"Run for your life!\" And that was exactly what I did. I scram bled towards the top of the hill with unbelievab le speed an d ag ility. Wh en I was halfway to the top I looked back an d saw don Juan stan ding in the sam e place. He signaled me to come down.

As I cam e closer to it I nearly yelled with fright. I re alized that it was not qu ite dead yet. Its body was still trembling. Its legs, which were sticking up in the air, shook wildly. The an imal was definitely in its last gasps. I walked in front of don Juan . A new jolt moved the an imal's body an d I could see i ts head . I turned to don Juan , horrified. Judging by its body the an imal was obviously a mam mal, yet it had a beak , like a bird. I stared at it in complete an d absolute horror. My mind refused to believe it. I was dumbfounded. I could not even articulate a word. Never in my whole existence had I witnessed an ything of that nature. Something inconceivab le was there in front of my very eyes.

I glan ced at h im an d glan ced at the an imal, an d then something in me arran ged the world an d I knew at once what the an imal was. I walked over to it an d picked it up. It was a large bran ch of a bush. It had been burnt, an d possibly the wind had blown some burnt debris wh ich got cau ght in the dry bran ch an d thus gav e the ap pearan ce of a large bulging round an imal. The color of the burnt debris made it look light brown in contrast with the green vegetation. I lau ghed at my idiocy an d excitedly explained to don Juan that the wind blowing through it had mad e it look like a live an imal. I thought he would be pleased with the way I had resolved the mystery, but he turned around an d began walking to the top of the hill. I followed him. He craw led inside the depression that looked like a cav e. It was not a hole but a shallow dent in the san dstone. Don Juan took some small bran ches an d used them to scoop up the dirt that had accumulated in the bottom of the depression. \"We hav e to get rid of the ticks, \" he said.

He did not seem to be an gry with me or disap pointed with my performan ce. He repeatedly stated that this was only the beg inning, that it took time to han dle power. He patted me on the shoulder an d joked that earlier that day I was the person who knew what was real an d what was not. I felt embarrassed. I began to ap ologize for my tendency of alway s being so sure of my way s. \" It doesn't matter, \" he said. \"That bran ch was a real an imal an d it was alive at the moment the power touched it.

He said that the spirit, which knew his voice, might become subdued with the sound of it an d leav e us alone. He e xplained that the idea of mak ing oneself accessible to power had serious overtones. Power was a devastating force that could easily lead to one's death an d had to be treated with great care. Becoming av ailable to power had to be done systematically, but al way s with great cau tion. It involved making one's presence obvious by a contained display of loud talk or an y other type of noisy activity, an d then it was man datory to observe a prolonged an d total silence. A controlled outburst an d a controlled qu ietness were the mark of a warrior. He said that properly I should hav e sustained the sight of the live monster for a while longer. In a controlled fashion, without losing my mind or becoming deran ged with excitation or fear, I should hav e striven to \"stop the wo rld.\" He pointed out that after I had run up the hill for dear life I was in a perfect state for \"stopping the world.\" Combined in that state were fear, aw e, power an d death; he said that such a state would be pretty hard to repeat. I whispered in his ear, \"Wh at do you mean by 'stopping the world'?\" He gav e me a ferocious look before he an swered that it was a techniqu e practiced by those who were hunting for power, a technique by virtue of which the world as we know it was made to collap se.

I parked my car off the road in a depression don Juan picked becau se it was deep enough to hide the car from view. From there we went directly to the top of the low hills, crossing a vast flat desolate area. Wh en it got dark don Juan selected a place to sleep. He deman ded comple te silence. The next day we ate frugally an d continued our journey in an easterly direction. The vegetation was no longer desert shrubbery but thick green mountain bushes an d trees. Around mid - afternoon we climbed to the top of a gigan tic bluff of conglome rate rock which looked like a wall. Don Juan sat down an d signaled me to sit down also. \"This is a place of power, \" he said after a moment's pau se. \"This is the place where warriors were buried a long time ag o.\" At that instan t a crow flew right ab ove us, cawing.

The y were not exactly places of power, like certain hills or lan d formations which were the abode of spirits, but rather places of enlightenment where one could be tau ght, where one could find solutions to dilemmas. \"All you hav e to do is come here, \" he said . \"Or spend the night on this rock in order to rearran ge your feelings.\" \"Are we going to spend the night here?\" \"I thought so, but a little crow just told me not to do that.\" I tried to find out more ab out the crow but he hushed me up with an impatient mo vement of his han d."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 \"Look at that circle of boulders, \" he said. \"Fix it in your memory an d then someday a crow will lead you to an other one of these places.

I said warriors were once buried here. I mean t they used to come here to bury themselves for a night, or for two days, or for whatever length of time they needed to.

If he succeeds in his hunting he can be a man of knowledge.\" \"Wh at do you . . .\" He stopped my qu estion with a movement of his han d. He stood up, signaled me to follow, an d began descending on the steep east side of the bluff. There was a definite trai l in the almost perpendicular face, lead ing to the round area. We slowly worked our way down the perilous path, an d when we reached the bottom floor don Juan , without stopping at all, led me through the thick chap arral to the middle of the circle. There he used some thick dry branches to sweep a clean spot for us to sit. The spot was also perfectly round. \"I intended to bury you here all night, \" he said. \"But I know now that it is not time yet. You don't hav e power. I'm going to bury you only for a short w hile.\" I becam e very nervous with the idea of being enclosed an d asked how he was plan ning to bury me. He giggled like a child and began collecting dry bran ches. He did not let me help him an d said I should sit down an d wait. He threw the bran ches he was c ollecting inside the clean circle. Then he made me lie down with my head towards the east, put my jacket under my head, an d made a cag e around my body. He constructed it by sticking pieces of bran ches about two an d a half feet in length in the soft dirt; t he bran ches, which ended in forks, served as supports for some long sticks that gav e the cag e a fram e an d the ap pearan ce of an open coffin. He closed the box like cag e by placing small bran ches an d leav es over the long sticks, encasing me from the shoulder s down. He let my head stick out with my jacket as a pillow."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 He then took a thick piece of dry wood an d, using it as a digging stick, he loosened the dirt around me an d covered the cag e with it. The fram e was so solid an d the leav es were so well placed tha t no dirt cam e inside. I could move my legs freely an d could actually slide in an d out. Don Juan said that ordinarily a warrior would construct the cag e an d then slip into it an d seal it from the inside. \"How ab out the an imals?\" I asked. \"Can they scratch the surface dirt an d sneak into the cag e an d hurt the man ?\" \"No, that's not a worry for a warrior. It's a worry for you becau se you hav e no power. A warrior, on the other han d, is guided by his unbending purpose an d can fend off an ything. No rat, or snak e, or mountain lion could bother him.\" \"Wh at do they bury themselves for, don Juan ?\" \"For enlightenment an d for power.\" I experienced an extremely pleasan t feeling of peace an d satisfaction; the world at that moment seemed at ease. The qu ietness was exqu isit e an d at the sam e time unnerving. I was not accustomed to that kind of silence. I tried to talk but he hushed me. After a while the tran qu ility of the place affected my mood. I began to think of my life an d my personal history an d experienced a fam iliar se nsation of sad ness an d remorse. I told him that I did not deserve to be there, that his world was strong an d fair an d I was weak , an d that my spirit had been distorted by the circumstan ces of my life. He lau ghed an d threatened to cover my head with dirt if I kept on talking in that vein. He said that I was a man . And like an y man I deserved everything that was a man 's - lot - joy, pain, sad ness an d struggle - an d that the nature of one's acts was unimportan t as long as one acted as a warrior. Lowering his voice t o almost a whisper, he said that if I really felt that my spirit was distorted I should simply fix it purge it, mak e it perfect - becau se there was no other task in our entire lives which was more worthwhile. Not to fix the spirit was to seek death, an d that was the sam e as to seek nothing, since death was going to overtak e us regardless of an ything. He pau sed for a long time an d then he said with a tone of profound conviction, \"To seek the perfection of the warrior's spirit is the only task worthy of our man hood.\" His words acted as a catalyst. I felt the weight of my past actions as an unbearab le an d hindering load . I admitted that there was no hope for me. I began to weep, talking about my life. I said that I had been roam ing for such a long time that I had become callous to pain an d sad ness, except on certain occasions when I would realize my aloneness an d my helplessness. He did not say an ything. He grab bed me by the armpits an d pulled me out of the cag e. I sat up when he let go of me. He also sat down. An uneasy silence set in between us. I thought he was giving me time to compose myself. I took my notebook an d scribbled out of nervousness."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 \"You feel like a leaf at the mercy of the wind, don't you?\" he finally said, staring at me. That was exactly the way I felt. He seemed to empathize with me. He said that my mood reminded him of a song an d began to sing in a low tone; his singing voice was very pleasing an d the lyrics carried me aw ay: \"I'm so far aw ay from the sky where I was born. Immense nostalgia invad es my thoughts. Now that I am so alone an d sad like a leaf in the wind, sometimes I wan t to weep, sometimes I wan t to lau gh with longing.\" (Que lejos estoy del cielo donde he nacido. Inmensa nostalgia invad e mi pensam iento. Ahora qu e estoy tan solo y trist e cual hoja al viento, qu isiera llorar, qu isiera reir de sentimiento.) We did not speak for a long while. He finally broke the silence. \"Since the day you were born, one way or an other, someone has been doing something to you, \" he said. \"That's correct, \" I said. \"And they hav e been doing something to you ag ainst your will.\" \"True.\" \"And by now you're helpless, like a leaf in the wind.\" \"That's correct. That's the way it is.\" I said that the circumstan ces of my life had sometimes been devastating. He liste ned attentively but I could not figure out whether he was just being ag reeable or genuinely concerned until I noticed that he was trying to hide a smile. \"No matter how much you like to feel sorry for yourself, you hav e to chan ge that, \" he said in a soft tone. \"It doesn't jibe with the life of a warrior.\" He lau ghed an d san g the song ag ain but contorted the intonation of certain words; the result was a ludicrous lam ent. He pointed out that the reason I had liked the song was becau se in my own life I had do ne nothing else but find flaws with everything an d lam ent. I could not argue with him. He was correct. Yet I believed I had sufficient reasons to justify my feeling of being like a leaf in the \"wind. \"The hardest thing in the world is to assume the mood of a warrior, \" he said. \"It is of no use to be sad an d complain an d feel justified in doing so, believing that someone is alway s doing something to us. Nobody is doing an ything to an ybody, much less to a warrior. \"You are here, with me, becau se you wan t to be here. You should hav e assumed full responsibility by now, so the idea that you are at the mercy of the wind would be inad missible.\" He stood up an d began to disassemble the cag e. He scooped the dirt back to where he had gotten it from an d carefully scat tered all the sticks in the chap arral. Then he covered the clean circle with debris, leav ing the area as if nothing had ever touched it."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 I commented on his proficiency. He said that a good hunter would know that we had been there no matter how careful he h ad been, becau se the tracks of men could not be completely erased. He sat cross - legged an d told me to sit down as comfortab ly as possible, facing the spot where he had buried me, an d stay put until my mood of sad ness had dissipated. \"A warrior buries himse lf in order to find power, not to weep with self - pity, \" he said. I attempted to explain but he mad e me stop with an impatient movement of his head. He said that he had to pull me out of the cag e in a hurry becau se my mood was intolerab le an d he was afraid that the place would resent my softness an d injure me. \"Self - pity doesn't jibe with power, \" he said. \"The mood of a warrior calls for control over himself an d at the sam e time it calls for aban doning himself.\" \"How can that be?\" I asked. \"How can he cont rol an d ab an don himself at the sam e time?\" \"It is a difficult techniqu e, \" he said. He seemed to deliberate whether or not to continue talking. Twice he was on the verge of say ing something but he checked himself an d smiled. \"You're not over your sad ness y et, \" he said. \"You still feel weak an d there is no point in talking about the mood of a warrior now.\" Almost an hour went by in complete silence. Then he abruptly asked me if I had succeeded in learning the \"dream ing\" techniques he had tau ght me. I had be en practicing assiduously an d had been ab le, after a monumental effort, to obtain a degree of control over my dream s. Don Juan was very right in say ing that one could interpret the exercises as being entertainment. For the first time in my life I had been looking forward to going to sleep. I gav e him a detailed report of my progress. It had been relatively easy for me to learn to sustain the imag e of my han ds after I had learned to comman d myself to look at them. My visions, although not alway s of my own ha nds, would last a seemingly long time, until I would finally lose control an d would become immersed in ordinary unpredictab le dream s. I had no volition whatsoever over when I would give myself the comman d to look at my han ds, or to look at other items of t he dream s. It would just hap pen. At a given moment I would remember that I had to look at my han ds an d then at the surroundings. There were nights, however, when I could not recall hav ing done it at all. He seemed to be satisfied an d wan ted to know what we re the usual items I had been finding in my visions. I could not think of an ything in particular an d started elab orating on a nightmarish dream I had had the night before. \"Don't get so fan cy, \" he said dryly."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 I told him that I had been recording all the d etails of my dream s. Since I had begun to practice looking at my han ds my dream s had become very compelling an d my sense of recall had increased to the point that I could remember minute details. He said that to follow them was a waste of time, becau se det ails an d vividness were in no way importan t. \"Ordinary dream s get very vivid as soon as you begin to set up dream ing\" he said. \"That vividness an d clarity is a formidab le barrier an d you are worse off than an yone I hav e ever met in my life. You hav e the wo rst man ia. You write down everything you can .\" In all fairness, I believed what I was doing was ap propriate. Keeping a meticulous record of my dream s was giving me a degree of clarity ab out the nature of the visions I had while sleeping. \"Drop it!\" he said imperatively. \"It's not helping an ything. All you're doing is distracting yourself from the purpose of dreaming, which is control an d power.\" He lay down an d covered his eyes with his hat an d talked without looking at me. \"I'm going to remind you of all t he techniqu es you must practice, \" he said. \"First you must focus your gaze on your han ds as the starting point. Then shift your gaze to other items an d look at them in brief glan ces. Focus your gaze on as man y things as you can . Remember that if you only glan ce briefly the imag es do not shift. Then go back to your han ds. \"Every time you look at your han ds you renew the power needed for dream ing, so in the beginning don't look at too man y things. Four items will suffice every time. Later on, you may enlarge the scope until you can cover all you wan t, but as soon as the imag es begin to shift an d you feel you are losing control go back to your han ds. \"Wh en you feel you can gaze at things indefinitely you will be read y for a new techniqu e. I'm going to teach yo u this new techniqu e now, but I expect you to put it to use only when you are read y.\" He was qu iet for ab out fifteen minutes. Finally he sat up an d looked at me. \"The next step in setting up dream ing is to learn to trav el, \" he said. \"The sam e way you hav e learned to look at your han ds you can will yourself to move, to go places. First you hav e to estab lish a place you wan t to go to. Pick a well known spot - perhap s your school, or a park, or a friend's house then, will yourself to go there. \"This techniqu e i s very difficult. You must perform two tasks: You must will yourself to go to the specific locale; an d then, when you hav e mastered that techniqu e, you hav e to learn to control the exact time of your trav eling.\" As I wrote down his statements I had the fee ling that I was really nuts. I was actually tak ing down insan e instructions, knocking myself out in order to follow them. I experienced a surge of remorse an d embarrassment. \"Wh at are you doing to me, don Juan ?\" I asked, not really mean ing it."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 He seemed s urprised. He stared at me for an instan t an d then smiled. \"You've been asking me the sam e qu estion over an d over. I'm not doing an ything to you.

He held my chin with one han d an d the back of my head with the other an d then moved my head back an d forth. The muscles of my neck were very tense an d moving my head reduced the tension. Don Juan looked up to the sky for a moment an d seemed to exam ine something in it. \"It's time to leav e, \" he said dryly an d stood up. We walked in an easterly direction until we cam e upon a patch of small trees in a valley between two large hills. It was almost five p.m. by then. He casually said th at we might hav e to spend the night in that place. He pointed to the trees an d said that there was water around there. He tensed his body an d began sniffing the air like an an imal. I could see the muscles of his stomach contracting in very fast short spasm s as he blew an d inhaled through his nose in rap id succession. He urged me to do the sam e an d find out by myself where the water was. I reluctan tly tried to imitate him. After five or six minutes of fast breathing I was dizzy , but my nostrils had cleared o ut in an extrao rdinary way an d I could actually detect the smell of river willows. I could not tell where they were, however. Don Juan told me to rest for a few minutes an d then he started me sniffing again. The second round was more intense. I could actua lly distinguish a whiff of river willow coming from my right. We headed in that direction an d found, a good qu arter of a mile aw ay , a swam p like spot with stag nan t water. We walked around it to a slightly higher flat mesa. Above an d around the mesa the cha parral was very thick. \"This place is craw ling with mountain lions and other smaller cats, \" don Juan said casually, as if it were a commonplace observation. I ran to his side an d he broke out lau ghing. \"Usually I wouldn't come here at all, \" he said. \"But the crow pointed out this direction. There must be something special ab out it.\" \"Do we really hav e to be here, don Juan ?\" \"We do. Otherwise I would av oid this place.\" I had become extremely nervous. He told me to listen attentively to what he had to say . \"The only thing one can do in this place is hunt lions, \" he said. \"So I'm going to teach you how to do that. \"There is a special way of constructing a trap for water rats that live around water holes. They serve as bait. The sides of the cag e are made to collap se an d very sharp spikes"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 are put along the sides. The spikes are hidden when the trap is up an d they do not affect an ything unless something falls on the cag e, in which case the sides collap se an d the spikes pierce whatever hits the trap .\" I could no t understan d what he mean t but he mad e a diagram on the ground an d showed me that if the side sticks of the cag e were placed on pivot like hollow spots on the fram e, the cag e would collap se onto either side if something pushed its top. The spikes were poin ted sharp slivers of hard wood, which were placed all around the fram e an d fixed to it. Don Juan said that usually a heav y load of rocks was placed over a net of sticks, which were connected to the cag e an d hung way ab ove it. Wh en the mountain lion cam e up on the trap baited with the water rats, it would usually try to break it by paw ing it with all its might; then the slivers would go through its paw s an d the cat, in a frenzy , would jump up, unleashing an av alan che of rocks on top of him. \"Someday you might need to catch a mountain lion, \" he said. \"They hav e special powers. They are terribly smart an d the only way to catch them is by fooling them with pain an d with the smell of river willows.\" Wi th astounding speed an d skill he assembled a trap an d after a long wait he cau ght three chubby squ irrel like rodents. He told me to pick a han dful of willows from the edge of the swam p an d made me rub my clothes with them. He did the sam e. Then, qu ickly an d skillfully, he wove two simple carrying nets out of reeds, s cooped up a large clump of green plan ts an d mud from the swam p, an d carried it back to the mesa, where he concealed himself. In the mean time the squ irrel - like rodents had begun to squ eak very loudly. Don Juan spoke to me from his hiding place and told me t o use the other carrying net, gather a good chunk of mud an d plan ts, an d climb to the lower bran ches of a tree near the trap where the rodents were. Don Juan said that he did not wan t to hurt the cat or the rodents, so he was going to hurl the mud at the l ion if it cam e to the trap . He told me to be on the alert an d hit the cat with my bundle after he had, in order to scare it aw ay . He recommended I should be extremely careful not to fall out of the tree. His final instructions were to be so still that I wo uld merge with the bran ches. I could not see where don Juan was. The squ ealing of the rodents becam e extremely loud an d finally was so dark that I could hardly distinguish the general features of the terrain. I heard a sudden an d close sound of soft steps an d a muffled catlike exhalation, then a very soft growl an d the squ irrel - like rodents ceased to squ eak . It was right then that I saw the dark mass of an an imal right under the tree where I was. Before I could even be sure that it was a mountain lion it ch arged against the trap , but before it reached it something hit it an d mad e it recoil. I hurled my bundle, as don Juan had told me to do. I missed, yet it made a very loud noise. At that instan t don Juan let out a series of penetrating yells that sent chill s through my spine, an d the cat, with extrao rdinary ag ility, leap ed to the mesa an d disap peared."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 Don Juan kept on mak ing the penetrating noises a while longer an d then he told me to come down from the tree, pick up the cag e with the squ irrels, run up to th e mesa, an d get to where he was as fast as I could. In an incredibly short period of time I was stan ding next to don Juan . He told me to imitate his yelling as close as possible in order to keep the lion off while he disman tled the cag e an d let the rodents free. I began to yell but could not produce the sam e effect. My voice was raspy becau se of the excitation. He said I had to ab an don myself an d yell with real feeling, becau se the lion was still around. Suddenly I fully realized the situation. The lion wa s real. I let out a mag nificent series of piercing yells. Don Juan roared with lau ghter. He let me yell for a moment an d then he said we had to leav e the place as qu ietly as possible, becau se the lion was no fool an d was probab ly retracing its steps back t o where we were. \"He'll follow us for sure, \" he said. \"No matter how careful we are we'll leav e a trail as wide as the Pan American highway .\" I walked very close to don Juan . From time to time he would stop for an instan t an d listen. At one moment he bega n to run in the dark an d I followed him with my han ds extended in front of my eyes to protect myself from the bran ches. We finally got to the base of the bluff where we had been earlier. Don Juan said that if we succeeded in climbing to the top without bei ng mau led by the lion we were safe. He went up first to show me the way . We started to climb in the dark. I did not know how, but I followed him with dead sure steps. Wh en we were near the top I heard a peculiar an imal cry. It was almost like the mooing of a cow, except that it was a bit longer an d coarser. \"Up! Up! \"don Juan yelled. I scram bled to the top in total darkness ah ead of don Juan . Wh en he reached the flat top of the bluff I was already sitting catching my breath. He rolled on the ground.

In retrospect, it all seemed unreal. It was as if everything had been stag ed for my benefit. The succession of events had been so rap id that I really had not had time to be afraid. I had had enough time to act, but not to deliberate upon my circumstan ces. In writing my notes the qu estion of whether I had really seen the mountain lion cam e to mind. The dry bran ch was still fresh in my memory. \"It was a mountain lion, \" don Ju an said imperatively. \"Was it a real flesh an d blood an imal?\" \"Of course.\" I told him that my suspicions had been roused becau se of the easiness of the total event. It was as if the lion had been waiting out there an d had been trained to do exactly what do n Juan had plan ned. He was unruffled by my barrag e of skeptical remarks.

However, I had to discard the idea becau se I had really seen the dark shap e of a four legged an imal charging at the cag e an d then leap ing to the mesa. \"Wh y do you mak e such a fuss?\" he said. \"It was just a big cat.

It was almost eleven a.m. Don Juan reminded me once more of the procedure to follow. \"Wat ch the wind, \" he said. \"Don't let it trip you. And don't le t it mak e you tired. Chew your power food an d hide from the wind behind my body. The wind won't hurt me; we know each other very well.\" He led me to a trail that went straight to the high mountains. The day was cloudy an d it was ab out to rain. I could see low rain clouds an d fog up ab ove in the mountains descending into the area where we were. We hiked in complete silence until ab out three o'clock in the afternoon. Chewing the dry meat was indeed invigorating. And watching for sudden chan ges in the directio n of the wind becam e a mysterious affair, to the point that my entire body seemed to sense chan ges before they actually hap pened. I had the feeling that I could detect wav es of wind as a sort of pressure on my upper chest, on my bronchial tubes. Every time I was ab out to feel a gust of wind my chest an d throat would itch. Don Juan stopped for a moment an d looked around. He ap peared to be orienting himself an d then he turned to the right. I noticed that he was also chewing dry meat. I felt very fresh an d was not tired at all. The task of being aw are of shifts in the wind had been so consuming that I had not been aw are of time. We walked into a deep rav ine an d then up one side to a small plateau on the sheer side of an enormous mountain. We were qu ite high, al most to the top of the mountain. Don Juan climbed a huge rock at the end of the plateau an d helped me up to it. The rock was placed in such a way as to look like a dome on top of precipitous walls. We slowly walked around it. Finally I had to move around t he rock on my seat, holding on to the surface with my heels an d han ds. I was soak ed in perspiration an d had to dry my han ds repeatedly. From the other side I could see a very large shallow cav e near the top of the mountain. It looked like a hall that had b een carved out of the rock. It was san dstone which had been weathered into a sort of balcony with two pillars.

He lau ghed an d said that it was an ideal place for men, since no other living creatures could stan d it. He climbed up to it like a mountain goat. I marveled at his stupendous ag ility. I slowl y drag ged myself down the rock on my seat an d then tried to run up the side of the mountain in order to reach the ledge. The last few yards completely exhau sted me. I kiddingly asked don Juan how old he really was. I thought that in order to reach the ledg e the way he had done it one had to be extremely fit an d young. \"I'm as young as I wan t to be, \" he said. \"This ag ain is a matter of personal power. If you store power your body can perform unbelievab le feats. On the other han d, if you dissipate power you' ll be a fat old man in no time at all.\" The length of the ledge was oriented along an east - west line. The open side of the balcony - like formation was to the south. I walked to the west end. The view was superb. The rain had circumvented us. It looked like a sheet of tran sparent material hung over the low lan d. Don Juan said that we had enough time to build a shelter. He told me to mak e a pile of as man y rocks as I could carry onto the ledge while he gathered some bran ches for a roof. In an hour he had built a wall ab out a foot thick on the east end of the ledge. It was ab out two feet long an d three feet high. He wove an d tied some bundles of bran ches he had collected an d mad e a roof, securing it onto two long poles that ended in forks. There was an other pole of the sam e length that was affixed to the roof itself an d which supported it on the opposite side of the wall. The structure looked like a high tab le with three legs. Don Juan sat cross - legged under it, on the very edge of the balcony. He told me to sit next to him, to his right. We remained qu iet for a while. Don Juan broke the silence. He said in a whisper that we had to act as if nothing was out of the ordinary. I asked if there was something in particular that I should do. He said that I should get bu sy writing an d do it in such a way that it would be as if I were at my desk with no worries in the world except writing. At a given moment he was going to nudge me an d then I should look where he was pointing with his eyes. He warned me that no matter what I saw I should not utter a single word. Only he could talk with impunity becau se he was known to all the powers in those mountains. I followed his instructions an d wrote for over an hour. I becam e immersed in my task. Suddenly I felt a soft tap on my arm an d saw don Juan 's eyes an d head move to point out a ban k of fog ab out two hundred yards aw ay which was descending from the top of the mountain. Don Juan whispered in my ear with a tone barely au dible even at that close ran ge. \"Move your eyes back an d fort h along the ban k of fog, \" he said. \"But don't look at it directly.

Perhap s half an hour went by. It was getting dark. The fog moved extremely slowly. At one moment I had the sudden feeling that I had detected a faint glow to my right. At first I thought that I had seen a patch of green s hrubbery through the fog. Wh en I looked at it directly I did not notice an ything, but when I looked without focusing I could detect a vag ue greenish area. I pointed it out to don Juan . He squ inted his eyes an d stared at it. \"Focus your eyes on that spot, \" he whispered in my ear. \"Look without blinking until you see.\" I wan ted to ask what I was supposed to see but he glared at me as if to remind me that I should not talk. I stared ag ain. The bit of fog that had come down from ab ove hung as if it were a piec e of solid matter. It was lined up right at the spot where I had noticed the green tint. As my eyes becam e tired ag ain an d I squ inted, I saw at first the bit of fog superimposed on the fog ban k, an d then I saw a thin strip of fog in between that looked lik e a thin unsupported structure, a bridge joining the mountain ab ove me an d the ban k of fog in front of me. For a moment I thought I could see the tran sparent fog, which was being blown down from the top of the mountain, going by the bridge without disturbi ng it. It was as if the bridge were actually solid. At one instan t the mirag e becam e so complete that I could actually distinguish the darkness of the part under the bridge proper, as opposed to the light san dstone color of its side. I stared at the bridge , dumbfounded. And then I either lifted myself to its level, or the bridge lowered itself to mine. Suddenly I was looking at a straight beam in front of me. It was an immensely long, solid beam , narrow and without railings, but wide enough to walk on. Don Juan shook me by the arm vigorously. I felt my head bobbing up an d down an d then I noticed that my eyes itched terribly. I rubbed them qu ite unconsciously. Don Juan kept on shak ing me until I opened my eyes ag ain. He poured some water from his gourd into t he hollow of his han d an d sprinkled my face with it. The sensation was very unpleasan t. The coldness of the water was so extreme that the drops felt like sores on my skin. I noticed then that my body was very warm. I was feverish. Don Juan hurriedly gav e m e some water to drink an d then splashed water on my ears an d neck. I heard a very loud, eerie an d - prolonged bird cry. Don Juan listened attentively for an instan t an d then pushed the rocks of the wall with his foot an d collap sed the roof. He threw the roof into the shrubs an d tossed all the rocks, one by one, over the side. He whispered in my ear, \"Drink some water and chew your dry meat. We can not stay here. That cry was not a bird.\" We climbed down the ledge an d began to walk in an easterly direction. In no time at all it was so dark that it was as if there were a curtain in front of my eyes. The fog was like an impenetrab le barrier. I had never realized how crippling the fog was at night. I could not conceive how don Juan walked. I held oh to his arm as i f I were blind."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 Somehow I had the feeling I was walking on the edge of a precipice. My legs refused to move on. My reason trusted don Juan an d I was rationally willing to go on, but my body was not, an d don Juan had to drag me in total darkness. He must ha ve known the terrain to ultimate perfection. He stopped at a certain point an d mad e me sit down. I did not dare let go of his arm. My body felt, beyond the shad ow of a doubt, that I was sitting on a barren dome like mountain an d if I moved an inch to my ri ght I would fall beyond the toleran ce point into an ab ysm. I was ab solutely sure I was sitting on a curved mountainside, becau se my body moved unconsciously to the right. I thought it did so in order to keep its verticality, so I tried to compensate by lea ning to the left ag ainst don Juan , as far as I could. Don Juan suddenly moved aw ay from me an d without the support of his body I fell on the ground. Touching the ground restored my sense of equ ilibrium. I was lying on a flat area.

I saw don Juan stan ding to my left. I saw huge trees an d a cav e a few feet behind him. Don Ju an told me to get into the hole. I craw led into it an d sat down with my back ag ainst the rock. I felt don Juan lean ing over to whisper that I had to be totally silent. There were three flashes of lightning, one after the other. In a glan ce I saw don Juan s itting cross legged to my left. The cav e was a concav e formation big enough for two or three persons to sit in. The hole seemed to hav e been carved at the bottom of a boulder. I felt that it had indeed been wise of me to hav e craw led into it, becau se if I had been walking I would hav e knocked my head ag ainst the rock. The brillian cy of the lightning gav e me an idea of how thick the ban k of fog was. I noticed the trunks of enormous trees as dark silhouettes ag ainst the opaqu e light gray mass of the fog. Don Juan whispered that the fog an d the lightning were in cah oots with each other an d I had to keep an exhau sting vigil becau se I was engaged in a battle of power. At that moment a stupendous flash of lightning rendered the whole scenery phan tasmag orical. The fog was like a white filter that frosted the light of the electrical discharge an d diffused it uniformly; the fog was like a dense whitish substan ce han ging between the tall trees, but right in front of me at the ground level the fog was thinning out. I pl ainly distinguished the features of the terrain. We were in a pine forest. Very tall trees surrounded us. They were so extremely big that I could hav e sworn we were in the redwoods if I had not previously known our whereab outs. There was a barrag e of light ning that lasted several minutes. Each flash made the features I had alread y observed more discernible. Right in front of me I saw a definite trail. There was no vegetation on it.

So when there was a long pau se between the flashes of lightning I was no longer disoriented by the blackness around me. Don Juan whispered that I had probably done enough watching, an d that I had to focus my attention on the sound of thund er. I realized to my am aze ment that I had not paid an y attention to thunder at all, in spite of the fact that it had really been tremendous. Don Juan added that I should follow the sound an d look in the direction where I thought it cam e from. There were no longer barrages of lightning an d thunder but only sporad ic flashes of intense light an d sound. The thunder seemed to alway s come from my right.

The light of the storm allowed me to est ab lish, however, that there was a ran ge of distan t mountains to my right an d that the forest was limited to the left side. It seemed that I was looking down into a dark valley, which I could not see at all. The ran ge over which the electrical storm was tak ing place was on the opposite side of the valley.

The fog had alread y invaded the lowlan ds, descending from the mountains to my right. On my left side the scenery was clear; the wind, however, seemed to be coming from my right an d was pushing the fog into the lowlan ds as if to s urround us. Don Juan whispered that I should remain impassive, stan ding where I was without closing my eyes, an d that I should not turn around until I was completely surrounded by the fog; only then was it possible to start our descent. He took cover at th e foot of some rocks a few feet behind me. The silence in those mountains was something mag nificent an d at the sam e time aw esome. The soft wind that was carrying the fog gav e me the sensation that the fog was hissing in my ears. Big chunks of fog cam e down hill like solid clumps of whitish matter rolling down on me. I smelled the fog. It was a peculiar mixture of a pungent an d fragran t smell. And then I was enveloped in it. I had the impression the fog was working on my eyelids. They felt heav y an d I wan ted to close my eyes. I was cold. My throat itched an d I wan ted to cough but I did not dare. I lifted my chin up an d stretched my neck to ease the cough, an d as I looked up I had the sensation I could actually see the thickness of the fog ban k. It was as if my eyes could assess the thickness by going through it. My eyes began to close an d I could not fight off the desire to fall asleep. I felt I was going to collap se on the ground an y moment. At that instan t don Juan jumped up an d grab bed me by the arms an d sho ok me. The jolt was enough to restore my lucidity. He whispered in my ear that I had to run downhill as fast as I could. He was going to follow behind becau se he did not wan t to get smashed by the rocks that I might turn over in my path. He said that I was the lead er, since it was my battle of power, an d that I had to be clear head ed an d aban doned in order to guide us safely out of there. \"This is it, \" he said in a loud voice. \"If you don't hav e the mood of a warrior, we may never leav e the fog.\" I hesitat ed for a moment.

He chuckled an d in a clowning mood he shook han ds with me an d greeted me ceremoniously. \"We 're going to go on a little trip, \" he said. \"You're going to drive us to a very special place in search of power.\" He unf olded two carrying nets an d placed two gourds filled with food in each of them, tied them with a thin rope, an d han ded me a net. We leisurely drove north some four hundred miles an d then we left the Pan American highway an d took a grav el road towards the w est. My car seemed to hav e been the only car on the road for hours. As we kept on driving I noticed that I could not see through my windshield. I strained desperately to look at the surroundings but it was too dark an d my windshield was overlaid with crush ed insects an d dust. I told don Juan that I had to stop to clean my windshield. He ordered me to go on driving even if I had to craw l at two miles an hour, sticking my head out of the window to see ah ead . He said that we could not stop until we had reached our destination. At a certain place he told me to turn to the right. It was so dark an d dusty that even the head lights did not help much. I drove off the road with great trepidation. I was afraid of the soft shoulders, but the dirt was packed. I drove for about one hundred yards at the lowest possible speed, holding the door open to look out. Finally don Juan told me to stop. He said that I had parked right behind a huge rock that would shield my car from view. I got out of the car an d walked around, guide d by the headlights. I wan ted to exam ine the surroundings becau se I had no idea where I was. But don Juan turned off the lights. He said loudly that there was no time to waste, that I should lock my car so we could start on our way . He han ded me my net wit h gourds. It was so dark that I stumbled an d nearly dropped them. Don Juan ordered me in a soft firm tone to sit down until my eyes were accustomed to the darkness. But my eyes were not the problem. Once I got out of my car I could see fairly well. Wh at wa s wrong was a peculiar nervousness that mad e me act as if I were absent minded. I was glossing over everything. \"Wh ere are we going?\" I asked. \"We 're going to hike in total darkness to a special place, \" he said. \"Wh at for?\" \"To find out for sure whether o r not you're capab le of continuing to hunt power.\""},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115 I asked him if what he was proposing was a test, an d if I failed the test would he still talk to me an d tell me ab out his knowledge. He listened without interrupting. He said that what we were doing was no t a test, that we were waiting for an omen, an d if the omen did not come the conclusion would be that I had not succeeded in hunting power, in which case I would be free from an y further imposition, free to be as stupid as I wan ted. He said that no matter what hap pened he was my friend an d he would always talk to me. Somehow I knew I was going to fail. \"The omen will not come, \" I said jokingly. \"I know it. I hav e a little power.\" He lau ghed an d patted me on the back gently. \"Don't you worry,\" he retorted. \"The omen will come. I know it. I hav e more power than you.\" He found his statement hilarious. He slap ped his thighs an d clap ped his han ds an d roared with lau ghter. Don Juan tied my carrying net to my back an d said that I should walk one step behind him a nd step in his tracks as much as possible. In a very dram atic tone he whispered, \"This is a walk for power, so everything counts.\" He said that if I would walk in his footsteps the power that he was dissipating as he walked would be tran smitted to me. I lo oked at my watch; it was eleven p.m. He mad e me line up like a soldier at attention. Then he pushed my right leg to the front an d made me stan d as if I had just tak en a step forward. He lined up in front of me in the sam e position an d then began to walk, a fter repeating the instructions that I should try to match his footsteps to perfection. He said in a clear whisper that I should not concern myself with an ything else except stepping in his tracks; I should not look ah ead or to the side but at the ground w here he was walking. He started off at a very relax ed pace. I had no trouble at all following him; we were walking on relatively hard ground. For ab out thirty yards I maintained his pace and I matched his steps perfectly; then I glan ced to the side for an instan t an d the next thing I knew I had bumped into him. He giggled an d assured me that I had not injured his an kle at all when I had stepped on it with my big shoes, but if I were going to keep on blundering one of us would be a cripple by morning. He sai d, lau ghing, in a very low but firm voice, that he did not intend to get hurt by my stupidity an d lack of concentration an d that if I stepped on him again I would hav e to walk barefoot. \"I can 't walk without shoes, \" I said in a loud raspy voice. Don Juan doubled up with lau ghter an d we had to wait until he had stopped. He assured me ag ain that he had mean t what he said. We were journeying to tap power an d things had to be perfect. The prospect of walking in the desert without shoes scared me beyond belief. Don Juan joked that my fam ily were probab ly the type of farmers that did not tak e off their shoes even to go to bed. He was right, of course. I had never walked barefoot an d to walk in the desert without shoes would hav e been suicidal for me."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116 \"This desert is oozing power, \" don Juan whispered in my ear. \"There is no time for being timid.\" We started walking ag ain. Don Juan kept an easy pace. After a while I noticed that we had left the hard ground an d were walking on soft san d. Don Juan 's feet san k into i t an d left deep tracks. We walked for hours before don Juan cam e to a halt. He did not stop suddenly but warned me ah ead of time that he was going to stop so I would not bump into him. The terrain had become hard again an d it seemed that we were going up a n incline. Don Juan said that if I needed to go to the bushes I should do it, becau se from then on we had a solid stretch without a single pau se. I looked at my watch; it was one a.m. After a ten - or fifteen - minute rest don Juan mad e me line up an d we bega n to walk ag ain. He was right, it was a dreadful stretch. I had never done an ything that deman ded so much concentration. Don Juan 's pace was so fast an d the tension of watching every step mounted to such heights that at a given moment I could not feel that I was walking an y more. I could not feel my feet or my legs. It was as if I were walking on air an d some force were carrying me on an d on. My concentration had been so total that I did not notice the grad ual chan ge in light. Suddenly I becam e aw are that I could see don Juan in front of me. I could see his feet an d his tracks instead of half guessing as I had done most of the night. At a given moment he unexpectedly jumped to the side an d my momentum carried me for about twenty yards further. As I slowed do wn my legs becam e weak an d started to shak e until finally I collap sed on the ground. I looked up at don Juan , who was calmly exam ining me. He did not seem to be tired. I was pan ting for breath an d soak ed in cold perspiration. Don Juan twirled me around in my lying position by pulling me by the arm. He said that if I wan ted to regain my strength I had to lie with my head towards the east. Little by little I relax ed an d rested my aching body. Finally I had enough energy to stan d up. I wan ted to look at my wat ch, but he prevented me by putting his han d over my wrist. He very gently turned me around to face the east an d said that there was no need for my confounded timepiece, that we were on mag ical time, an d that we were going to find out for sure whether or no t I was cap ab le of pursuing power. I looked around. We were on top of a very large high hill. I wan ted to walk towards something that looked like an edge or a crevice in the rock, but don Juan jumped an d held me down. He ordered me imperatively to stay on the place I had fallen until the sun had come out from behind some black mountain peak s a short distan ce aw ay. He pointed to the east an d called my attention to a heav y ban k of clouds over the horizo n. He said that it would be a proper omen if the wind ble w the clouds aw ay in time for the first ray s of the sun to hit my body on the hilltop."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117 He told me to stan d still with my right leg in front, as if I were walking, an d not to look directly at the horizo n but look without focusing. My legs becam e very stiff an d my calves hurt. It was an ag onizing position an d my leg muscles were too sore to support me. I held on as long as I could. I was ab out to collap se. My legs were shivering uncontrollab ly when don Juan called the whole thing off. He helped me to sit down . The ban k of clouds had not moved an d we had not seen the sun rising over the horizo n. Don Juan 's only comment was, \"Too bad .\" I did not wan t to ask right off what the real implications of my failure were, but knowing don Juan , I was sure he had to follow the dictum of his omens. And there had been no omen that morning. The pain in my calves van ished an d I felt a wav e of. wellbeing. I began to trot in order to loosen up my muscles. Don Juan told me very softly to run up an ad jacent hill an d gather some lea ves from a specific bush an d rub my legs in order to alleviate the muscular pain. From where I stood I could very plainly see a large lush green bush. The leav es seemed to be very moist. I had used them before. I never felt that they had helped me, but don Juan had alway s maintained that the effect of really friendly plan ts was so subtle that one could hardly notice it, yet they alway s produced the results they were supposed to. I ran down the hill an d up the other. Wh en I got to the top I realized that the exertion had almost been too much for me. I had a hard time catching my breath an d my stomach was upset. I squ atted an d then crouched over for a moment until I felt relaxed. Then I stood up an d reached over to pick the leav es he had asked me to. But I cou ld not find the bush. I looked around. I was sure I was on the right spot, but there was nothing in that area of the hilltop that even vag uely resembled that particular plan t. Yet that had to be the spot where I had seen it. Any other place would have been out of ran ge for an yone looking from where don Juan was stan ding. I gav e up the search an d walked to the other hill. Don Juan smiled benevolently as I explained my mistak e. \"Wh y do you call it a mistak e?\" he asked. \"Obviously the bush is not there, \" I sa id. \"But you saw it, didn't you?\" \"I thought I did.\" \"Wh at do you see in its place now?\" \"Nothing.\" There was ab solutely no vegetation on the spot where I thought I had seen the plan t. I attempted to explain what I had seen as a visual distortion, a sort of mirag e. I had really been exhau sted, an d becau se of my exhau stion I may hav e easily believed I was seeing something that I expected to be there but which was not there at all. Don Juan chuckled softly an d stared at me for a brief moment. \"I see no mista ke, \" he said. \"The plan t is there on that hilltop.\""},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 It was my turn to lau gh. I scan ned the whole area carefully. There were no such plan ts in view an d what I had experienced was, to the best of my knowledge, a hallucination. Don Juan very calmly began to descend the hill an d signaled me to follow. We climbed together to the other hilltop an d stood right where I thought I had seen the bush. I chuckled with the ab solute certainty I was right. Don Juan also chuckled. \"Wal k to the other side of the hill, \" don Juan said. \"You'll find the plan t there.\" I brought up the point that the other side of the hill had been outside my field of vision, that a plan t may be there, but that that did not mean an ything. Don Juan signaled me with a movement of his head to follo w him. He walked around the top of the hill instead of going directly across, an d dram atically stood by a green bush without looking at it. He turned an d looked at me. It was a peculiarly piercing glan ce. \"There must be hundreds of such plan ts around here, \" I said. Don Juan very patiently descended the other side of the hill, with me trailing along. We looked everywhere for a similar bush. But there was none in sight. We covered ab out a qu arter of a mile before we cam e upon an other plan t. Wi thout say ing a word, don Juan led me back to the first hilltop. We stood there for a moment an d then he guided me on an other excursion to look for the plan t but in the opposite direction. We combed the area an d found two more bushes, perhap s a mile aw ay . They had grown t ogether an d stuck out as a patch of intense rich green, more lush than all the other surrounding bushes. Don Juan looked at me with a serious expression. I did not know what to think of it. \"This is a very stran ge omen, \" he said. We returned to the first hilltop, mak ing a wide detour in order to ap proach it from a new direction. He seemed to be going out of his way to prove to me that there were very few such plan ts around there. We did not find an y of them on our way. Wh en we reached the hilltop we sat do wn in complete silence. Don Juan untied his gourds. \"You'll feel better after eating, \" he said. He could not hide his delight. He had a beam ing grin as he patted me on the head. I felt disoriented. The new developments were disturbing, but I was too hungr y an d tired to really ponder upon them. After eating I felt very sleepy. Don Juan urged me to use the techniqu e of looking without focusing in order to find a suitab le spot to sleep on the hilltop where I had seen the bush. I selected one. He picked up the debris from the spot an d made a circle with it the size of my body. Very gently he pulled some fresh bran ches from the bushes an d swept the area inside the circle. He only went through the motions of sweeping, he did not really touch the ground with the bran ches. He then removed all the surface rocks from the area inside the circle an d placed them in the center after meticulously sorting them by size into two piles of equ al number."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 \"Wh at are you doing with those rocks?\" I asked. \"They are not rocks, \" he said. \"They are strings. They will hold your spot suspended.\" He took the smaller rocks an d marked the circumference of the circle with them. He spaced them evenly an d with the aid of a stick he secured each rock firmly in the ground as if he were a mason . He did not let me come inside the circle but told me to walk around an d watch what he did. He counted eighteen rocks, following a counterclockwise direction. \"Now run down to the bottom of the hill an d wait, \" he said. \"And I will come to the edge an d se e if you are stan ding in the ap propriate spot.\" \"Wh at are you going to do?\" \"I'm going to toss each of these strings to you, \" he said, pointing to the pile of bigger rocks. \"And you hav e to place them in the ground at the spot I will indicate in the sam e man ner I hav e placed the other ones. \"You must be infinitely careful. Wh en one is dealing with power, one has to be perfect. Mistak es are dead ly here. Each of these is a string, a string that could kill us if we leav e it around loose; so you simply can 't m ak e an y mistak es. You must fix your gaze on the spot where I, will throw the string. If you get distracted by an ything at all, the string will become an ordinary rock an d you won't be ab le to tell it ap art from the other rocks lying around.\" I suggested th at it would be easier if I carried the \"strings\" downhill one at a time. Don Juan lau ghed an d shook his head negatively. \"These are strings, \" he insisted. \"And they hav e to be tossed by me an d hav e to be picked up by you.\" It took hours to fulfill the tas k. The degree of concentration needed was excruciating. Don Juan reminded me every time to be attentive an d focus my gaze. He was right in doing so. To pick out a specific rock that cam e hurtling downhill, displacing other rocks in its way , was indeed a ma ddening affair. Wh en I had completely closed the circle an d walked to the top, I thought I was ab out to drop dead. Don Juan had picked some small bran ches an d had matted the circle. He han ded me some leav es an d told me to put them inside my pan ts, ag ainst the skin of my umbilical region. He said that they would keep me warm an d I would not need a blan ket to sleep. I tumbled down inside the circle. The bran ches mad e a fairly soft bed an d I fell asleep instan tly. It was late afternoon when I woke up. It was w indy an d cloudy. The clouds overhead were compact cumulus clouds, but towards the west they were thin cirrus clouds an d the sun shone on the lan d from time to time. Sleeping had renewed me.

I lay down ag ain on the mat of bran ches an d stran gely enough my ap prehension van ished. I ag ain experienced a sense of qu ietness, an exqu isite sense of well being. It was an extremely new sensation to me; my thoughts seemed t o hav e been turned off. I was hap py. I felt healthy. A very qu iet ebullience filled me. A soft wind was blowing from the west an d swept over my entire body without mak ing me cold. I felt it on my face an d around my ears, like a gentle wav e of warm water th at bathed me an d then receded an d bathed me ag ain. It was a stran ge state of being that had no parallel in my busy an d dislocated life. I began to weep, not out of sadness or self - pity but out of some ineffab le, inexplicab le joy. I wan ted to stay in that s pot forever an d I may hav e, had don Juan not come an d yan ked me out of the place. \"You've had enough rest, \" he said as he pulled me up. He led me very calmly on a walk around the periphery of the hilltop. We walked slowly an d in complete silence. He seeme d to be interested in making me observe the scenery all around us. He pointed to clouds an d mountains with a movement of his eyes or with a movement of his chin. The scenery in the late afternoon was superb. It evoked sensations of awe an d despair in me. I t reminded me of sights in my childhood. We climbed to the highest point of the hilltop, a peak of igneous rock, an d sat down comfortab ly with our backs ag ainst the rock, facing the south. The endless expan se of lan d towards the south was truly majestic. \" Fix all this in your memory, \" don Juan whispered in my ear. \"This spot is yours. This morning you saw , an d that was the omen. You found this spot by seeing. The omen was unexpected, but it hap pened. You are going to hunt power whether you like it or not. It is not a human decision, not yours or mine. \"Now, properly speak ing, this hilltop is your place, your beloved place; all that is around you is under your care. You must look after everything here an d everything will in turn look after you.\" In a joking way I asked if everything was mine. He said yes in a very serious tone. I lau ghed an d told him that what we were doing reminded me of the story of how the Span iards that conqu ered the New Wo rld had divided the lan d in the nam e of their king. They used to c limb to the top of a mountain and claim all the lan d they could see in an y specific direction. \"That's a good idea, \" he said. \"I'm going to give you all the lan d you can see, not in one direction but all around you.\" He stood up an d pointed with his exten ded han d, turning his body around to cover a complete circle. \"All this lan d is yours, \" he said. I lau ghed out loud. He giggled an d asked me, \"Wh y not? Wh y can 't I give you this lan d?\""},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 \"You don't own this lan d, \" I said. \"So what?

He had an explosion of lau ghter an d nearly fell of the rock. \"All thi s lan d, as far as you can see, is yours, \" he went on, still smiling. \"Not to use but to remember. This hilltop, however, is yours to use for the rest of your life. I am giving it to you becau se you hav e found it yourself. It is yours.

Except for his funny smile, he ap peared to actually believe that he could give me that hilltop. \"Wh y not?\" he asked as if he were read ing my thoughts. \"I accept it, \" I said half in jest. His smile disap peared. He squ inted his eyes as he looked at me. \"Every rock an d pebble an d bush on this hill, especially on the top, is under your care, \" he said. \"Every worm that lives here is your friend. You can use them an d they can use you.\" We remained silent for a few minu tes. My thoughts were unusually scarce. I vag uely felt that his sudden chan ge of mood was foreboding to me, but I was not afraid or ap prehensive. I just did not wan t to talk an y more. Somehow, words seemed to be inaccurate an d their mean ings difficult to p inpoint. I had never felt that way ab out talking, an d upon realizing my unusual mood I hurriedly began to talk. \"But what can I do with this hill, don Juan ?\" \"Fix every feature of it in your memory. This is the place where you will come in dream ing. This is the place where you will meet with powers, where secrets will someday be revealed to you. \"You are hunting power an d this is your place, the place where you will store your resources. \"It doesn't mak e sense to you now. So let it be a piece of nonsense f or the time being.\" We climbed down the rock an d he led me to a small bowl like depression on the west side of the hilltop. We sat down an d ate there. Undoubtedly there was something indescribab ly pleasan t for me on that hilltop. Eating, like resting, was an unknown exqu isite sensation. The light of the setting sun had a rich, almost copperish, glow, an d everything in the surroundings seemed to be dab bed with a golden hue. I was given totally to observing the scenery; I did not even wan t to think. Don Juan spoke to me almost in a whisper. He told me to watch every detail of the surroundings, no matter how small or seemingly trivial. Especially the features of the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 scenery that were most prominent in a westerly direction. He said that I should look at the sun without focusing on it until it had disap peared over the horizo n. The last minutes of light, right before the sun hit a blan ket of low clouds or fog, were, in a total sense, mag nificent. It was as if the sun were inflam ing the earth, kindling it like a bon fire. I felt a sensation of redness in my face. \"Stan d up!\" don Juan shouted as he pulled me up. He jumped away from me an d ordered me in an imperative but urging voice to trot on the spot where I was stan ding. As I jogged on the sam e spot, I began to feel a warmth invad ing my body. It was a copperish warmth. I felt it in my palate an d in the \"roof\" of my eyes. It was as if the top part of my head were burning with a cool fire that rad iated a copperish glow. Something in myself made me trot faster an d faste r as the sun began to disap pear. At a given moment I truly felt I was so light that I could hav e flown aw ay . Don Juan very firmly grab bed my right wrist. The sensation cau sed by the pressure of his han d brought back a sense of sobriety an d composure. I plu nked down on the ground an d he sat down by me. After a few minutes rest he qu ietly stood up, tap ped me on the shoulder, an d signaled me to follow him. We climbed back ag ain to the peak of igneous rock where we had sat before. The rock shielded us from the cold wind. Don Juan broke the silence. \"It was a fine omen, \" he said. \"How stran ge! It hap pened at the end of the day. You an d I are so different. You are more a creature of the night. I prefer the young brillian cy of the morning. Or rather the brillian cy of the morning sun seeks me, but it shies aw ay from you.

The omen, when it hap pens, has alway s been in the realm of the young sun.\" \"Wh y is it that way , don Juan ?\" \"This is not the time to talk ab out it,\" he said cuttingly. \"Knowledge is power. It tak es a long time to harness enough power to even talk about it.\" I tried to insist, but he chan ged the topic abruptly. He asked me about my progress in \"dream ing.\" I had begun to dream about specific places, such as the school an d the houses of a few friends. \"We re you at those places during the day or during the night?\" he asked."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 My dream s corresponded to the ti me of the day when I ordinarily was accustomed to being at those places - in the school during the day , at my friends' houses at night. He suggested that I should try \"dream ing\" while I took a nap during the day time an d find out if I could actually visuali ze the chosen place as it was at the time I was \"dream ing.\" If I were \"dream ing\" at night, my visions of the locale should be of night time. He said that what one experiences in \"dream ing\" has to be congruous with the time of the day when \"dream ing\" was ta king place; otherwise the visions one might hav e were not \"dream ing\" but ordinary dream s. \"In order to help yourself you should pick a specific object that belongs to the place you wan t to go an d focus your attention on if, \" he went on. \"On this hilltop h ere, for instan ce, you now hav e a specific bush that you must observe until it has a place in your memory.

The heat of my body was uncomfortab le. I believed I was running a high temperature, an d I becam e absorbed in trying to conceive by what mean s don Juan had produced it. Don Juan walked behind me.

He said that what I had felt was the power of the leav es, an d that that power had cleared me an d had enab led me to fulfill my task. I asserted in all sincerity that I had done nothing in particular, an d that I sat down on that place becau se I was tired an d becau se I found the color of the san dstone very ap pealing.

Suddenly he jumped back an d with incredible ag ility ran an d leap ed over some bushes to a high crest of rocks some distan ce aw ay . \"Wh at's the matter?\" I asked, alarmed. \"Wat ch the direction in which the wind will blow your leav es, \" he s aid. \"Count them qu ickly. The wind is coming. Keep half of them an d put them back ag ainst your belly.\" I counted twenty leav es. I stuck ten under my shirt an d then a strong gust of wind scattered the other ten in a westerly direction. I had the eerie feeli ng as I saw the leav es being blown off that a real entity was deliberately sweeping them into the am orphous mass of green shrubbery.

He opened his eyes at the sam e time I did. It was windy but I did not feel cold. The leav es on my stomach seemed to hav e acted as a furnace, a heater of some sort. I exam ined the surroundings. The place I had selected to rest was like a small basin. One could actually sit on it as on a long couch; there was enough of a rock wall to ser ve as a backrest.

You see, the key to stored power is that it can be used only to help someone else store power.\" I asked him if that mean t that his power was limited only to helping others. Don Juan patiently explained that he could use his personal power however he pleased, in an ything he himself wan ted, but when it cam e to giving it directly to an other person, it was useless unless that person utilized it for his own search of personal power. \" Everything a man does hinges on his personal power,\" don Juan went on. \"Therefore, for one who doesn't hav e an y, the deeds of a powerful man are incredible.

His body moved at the sam e time his eyes moved; the total effect was that of a hieratic mechan ical toy that turned in a complete circle in a precise an d unaltered movement. I looked at him with my mouth open. He hid a smile, cognizan t of my surprise. \"Today you are going to hunt power in the darkness of the day ,\" he said an d sat down. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Tonight you'll venture into those unknown hills.

He found this imag e funny an d lau ghed out loud. He then proceeded to d emonstrate a special way of walking in the darkness, a way which he called \"the gait of power.\" He stooped over in front of me an d made me run my han ds over his back an d knees, in order to get an idea of the position of his body. Don Juan 's trunk was sligh tly bent forward, but his spine was straight. His knees were also slightly bent.

I could not conceive how he could run in total darkness."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 \"The gait of power is for running at night, \" he whispered in my ear. He urged me to try it myself. I told him that I was sure I would break my legs falling into a crevice or ag ainst a roc k. Don Juan very calmly said that the \"gait of power\" was completely safe. I pointed out that the only way I could understan d his acts was by assuming he knew those hills to perfection an d thus could av oid the pitfalls. Don Juan took my head in his han ds a nd whispered forcefully, \"This is the night! And it is power!\" He let go of my head an d then added in a soft voice that at night the world was different, an d that his ab ility to run in the darkness had nothing to do with his knowledge of those hills. He sa id that the key to it was to let one's personal power flow out freely, so it could merge with the power of the night, an d that once that power took over there was no chan ce for a slip - up. He added, in a tone of utmost seriousness, that if I doubted it I sh ould consider for a moment what was tak ing place. For a man of his ag e to run in those hills at that hour would be suicidal if the power of the night was not guiding him. \"Look!\" he said an d ran swiftly out into the darkness an d cam e back ag ain. The way hi s body moved was so extrao rdinary that I could not believe what I was seeing. He sort of jogged on the sam e spot for a moment. The man ner in which he lifted his legs reminded me of a sprinter doing preliminary warm - up exercises. He then told me to follow h im. I did it with utter constraint an d uneasiness. Wi th extreme care I tried to look where I was stepping but it was impossible to judge distan ce. Don Juan cam e back an d jogged by my side. He whispered that I had to ab an don myself to the power of the night an d trust the little bit of personal power that I had , or I would never be ab le to move with freedom, and that the darkness was encumbering only becau se I relied on my sight for everything I did, not knowing that an other way to move was to let power be th e guide. I tried various times without an y success. I simply could not let go. The fear of injuring my legs was overpowering. Don Juan ordered me to keep on moving in the sam e spot an d to try to feel as if I were actually using the \"gait of power.\" He then said that he was going to run ah ead and that I should wait for his owl's cry. He disap peared in the darkness before I could say an ything. I closed my eyes at times an d jogged on the sam e spot with my knees an d trunk bent for perhap s an hour. Little by lit tle my tension began to ease up until I was fairly comfortab le. Then I heard don Juan 's cry. I ran five or six yards in the direction where the cry cam e from; trying to \"aban don myself, \" as don Juan had suggested. But stumbling into a bush immediately bro ught back my feelings of insecurity."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 Don Juan was waiting for me an d corrected my posture. He insisted I should first curl my fingers ag ainst my palms, stretching out the thumb an d index of each han d. Then he said that in his opinion I was just indulging m yself in my feelings of inad equ acy, since I knew for a fact I could alway s see fairly well, no matter how dark the night was, if I did not focus on an ything but kept scan ning the ground right in front of me. The \"gait of power\" was similar to finding a pla ce to rest. Both entailed a sense of ab an don, an d a sense of trust. The \"gait of power\" requ ired that one keep the eyes on the ground directly in front, becau se even a glan ce to either side would produce an alteration in the flow of movement. He explained that bending the trunk forward was necessary in order to lower the eyes, an d the reason for lifting the knees up to the chest was becau se the steps had to be very short an d safe. He warned me that I was going to stumble a great deal at first but he assured me that with practice I could run as swiftly an d as safely as I could in the day time. For hours I tried to imitate his movements an d get into the mood he recommended. He would very patiently jog on the sam e spot in front of me, or he would tak e off in a s hort run an d return to where I was, so I could see how he moved. He would even push me an d mak e me run a few yards. Then he took off an d called me with a series of owl cries. In some inexplicab le way I moved with an unexpected degree of self confidence. To my knowledge I had done nothing to warran t that feeling, but my body seemed to be cognizan t of things without thinking about them. For exam ple, I could not really see the jag ged rocks in my way , but my body alway s man ag ed to step on the edges an d never in the crevices, except for a few mishap s when I lost my balan ce becau se I becam e distracted. The degree of concentration needed to keep scan ning the area directly in front had to be total. As don Juan had warned me, an y slight glan ce to the side or too far ah ead altered the flow. I located don Juan after a long search. He was sitting by some dark shap es that seemed to be trees. He cam e towards me an d said that I was doing very well, but it was time to qu it becau se he had been using his whistle long enough an d was sure that by then it could be imitated by others. I ag reed that it was time to stop. I was nearly exhau sted by my attempts. I felt relieved an d asked him who would imitate his cry. \"Powers, allies, spirits, who knows?\" he said in a whisper. He explai ned that those \"entities of the night\" usually mad e very melodious sounds but were at a great disad van tag e in reproducing the raspiness of human cries or bird whistlings. He cau tioned me to alway s stop moving if I ever heard such a sound an d to keep in min d all he had said, becau se at some other time I might need to mak e the proper identification. In a reassuring tone he said that I had a very good idea what the \"gait of power\" was like, an d that in order to master it I needed only a slight push, which I co uld get on an other occasion when we ventured ag ain into the night. He patted me on the shoulder an d an nounced that he was ready to leav e. \"Let's get out of here, \" he said an d began running."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 \"Wai t!

I can only run. I'll break my legs if I walk.\" I had the feeling he was grinning when he said that, although I could not see his f ace. He ad ded in a confidential tone that he was too old to walk an d the little bit of the \"gait of power\" that I had learned that night had to be stretched to meet the occasion. \"If we don't use the 'gait of power' we will be mowed down like grass, \" he w hispered in my ear. \"By whom?\" \"There are things in the night that act on people, \" he whispered in a tone that sent chills through my body. He said that it was not importan t that I keep up with him, becau se he was going to give repeated signals of four ow l cries at a time so I could follow him. I suggested that we should stay in those hills until daw n an d then leav e. He retorted in a very dram atic tone that to stay there would be suicidal; an d even if we cam e out alive, the night would hav e drained our per sonal power to the point that we could not av oid being the victims of the first hazar d of the day . \"Let's not waste an y more time, \" he said with a note of urgency in his voice. \"Let's get out of here.\" He reassured me that he would try to go as slowly as possible. His final instructions were that I should try not to utter a sound, not even a gasp, no matter what hap pened. He gav e me the general direction we were going to go in an d began running at a markedly slower pace. I followed him, but no matter how s low he moved I could not keep up with him, an d he soon disap peared in the darkness ah ead of me. After I was alone I becam e aware that I had adopted a fairly fast walk without realizing it. And that cam e as a shock to me. I tried to maintain that pace for a long while an d then I heard don Juan 's call a little bit to my right. He whistled four times in succession. After a very short while I again heard his owl cry, this time to my far right. In order to follow it I had to mak e a forty five degree turn. I bega n to move in the new direction, expecting that the other three cries of the set would give me a better orientation. I heard a new whistle, which placed don Juan almost in the direction where we had started. I stopped an d listened. I heard a very sharp nois e a short distan ce aw ay . Something like the sound of two rocks being struck ag ainst each other. I strained to listen an d detected a series of soft noises, as if two rocks were being struck gently. There was an other owl's cry an d then I knew what don Juan h ad mean t. There was something truly melodious ab out it. It was definitely longer an d even more mellow than a real owl's.

I tur ned around an d started to semi - jog in the opposite direction. I heard a faint owl cry in the distan ce. There was a rap id succession of three more cries. They were don Juan 's. I ran in their direction. I felt that he must hav e then been a good qu arter of a mile aw ay an d if he kept up that pace I would soon be inextricab ly alone in those hills. I could not understan d why don Juan would run ah ead , when he could hav e run around me, if he needed to keep that pace. I noticed then that there seemed to be something moving with me to my left. I could almost see it in the extreme periphery of my visual field. I was about to pan ic, but a sobering thought crossed my mind. I could not possibly see an ything in the dark. I wan ted to stare in that direction but I was afraid to lose my momentum. Another owl cry jolted me out of my deliberations. It cam e from my left. I did not follow it becau se it was without a doubt the most sweet an d melodious cry I had ever heard. It did not frighten me though. There was something very ap p ealing, or perhap s hau nting, or even sad about it. Then a very swift dark mass crossed from left to right ah ead of me. The suddenness of its movements mad e me look ah ead, I lost my balan ce an d crashed noisily ag ainst some shrubs. I fell down on my side an d then I heard the melodious cry a few steps to my left. I stood up, but before I could start moving forward ag ain there was an other cry, more deman ding an d compelling than the first. It was as if something there wan ted me to stop an d listen. The sound of t he owl cry was so prolonged an d gentle that it eased my fears. I would hav e actually stopped had I not heard at that precise moment don Juan 's four raspy cries. They seemed to be nearer. I jumped an d took off in that direction. After a moment I noticed aga in a certain flicker or a wav e in the darkness to my left. It was not a sight proper, but rather a feeling, an d yet I was almost sure I was perceiving it with my eyes. It moved faster than I did, an d ag ain it crossed from left to right, mak ing me lose my b alan ce. This time I did not fall down, an d stran gely enough not falling down an noyed me. I suddenly becam e an gry an d the incongruency of my feelings threw me into true pan ic. I tried to accelerate my pace. I wan ted to give out an owl cry myself to let don Juan know where I was, but I did not dare to disobey his instructions. At that moment some gruesome thing cam e to my attention. There was actually something like an an imal to my left, almost touching me. I jumped involuntarily an d veered to my right. The f right almost suffocated me. I was so intensely gripped by fear that there were no thoughts in my mind as I moved in the darkness as fast as I could. My fear seemed to be a bodily sensation that had nothing to do with my thoughts. I found that condition ver y unusual. In the course of my life, my fears had alway s been mounted on an intellectual matrix an d had been engendered by threatening social situations, or by people behav ing towards me in dan gerous way s. This time, however, my fear was a true novelty. I t cam e from an unknown part of the world an d hit me in an unknown part of myself. I heard an owl cry very close an d slightly to my left.

The raspiness of don Juan 's whistles was there, so I moved faster. A third whistle cam e from a very short distan ce aw ay . I could distinguish a dark mass of rocks or perhap s trees. I heard an other owl's cry an d I thought that don Juan was wa iting for me becau se we were out of the field of dan ger. I was almost at the edge of the darker area when a fifth cry froze me on the spot. I strained to see ah ead into the dark area, but a sudden rustling sound to my left mad e me turn around in time to no tice a black object, blacker than the surroundings, rolling or sliding by my side. I gasped an d jumped aw ay . I heard a clicking sound, as if someone were smacking his lips, an d then a very large dark mass lurched out of the darker area. It was square, like a door, perhap s eight to ten feet high. The suddenness of its ap pearan ce mad e me scream . For a moment my fright was all out of proportion, but a second later I found myself awesomely calm, staring at the dark shap e. My reactions were, as far as I was conc erned, an other total novelty. Some part of myself seemed to pull me towards the dark area with an eerie insistence, while an other part of me resisted. It was as if I wan ted to find out for sure on the one han d, an d on the other I wan ted to run hysterically out of there. I barely heard don Juan 's owl cries. They seemed to be very close by an d they seemed to be fran tic; they were longer an d raspier, as though he was whistling while lie ran towards me.

He put his han d on my mouth an d signaled me to follow an d we both jogged at a very comfortab le pace until we cam e to the sandstone ledge where we had been before. We sat in absolute silence on the ledge for ab out an hour, until daw n. Then we ate food from the gourds. Don Juan said that we had to remain on the ledge until midday, an d that we were not going to sleep at all but were going to talk as if nothing was out of the ordinary. He asked me to relate in detail everything that had hap pened to me from the moment he had left me. Wh en I concluded my narration he stay ed qu iet for a long time. He seemed to be immersed in deep thought. \"It does n't look too good, \" he finally said. \"What hap pened to you last night was very serious, so serious that you can not venture into the night alone an y more. From now on the entities of the night won't leav e you alone.\" \"Wh at hap pened to me last night, don Ju an ?\" \"You stumbled on some entities which are in the world, an d which act on people. You know nothing ab out them becau se you hav e never encountered them. Perhap s it would be more proper to call them entities of the mountains; they don't really belong to th e night. I call them entities of the night becau se one can perceive them in the darkness with greater ease. They are here, around us at all times.

To only talk ab out power is useless.

Since the natural ab odes of the entities of the night are rocks an d crevices, you can not go to the mountains from now on unless you hav e stored enough personal power.\" \"But how can I store personal power?\" \"You are doing it by living the way I hav e recommended. Little by little you are plugging all your points of drainag e. You don't hav e to be deliberate ab out it, becau se power alway s finds a way. Tak e me as an example. I didn't know I was storing power whe n I first began to learn the way s of a warrior. Just like you, I thought I wasn't doing an ything in particular, but that was not so. Power has the peculiarity of being unnoticeab le when it is being stored.\" I asked him to explain how he had arrived at the conclusion that it was dan gerous for me to stay by myself in the darkness. \"The entities of the night moved along your left, \" he said. \"They were trying to merge with your death.

And that would hav e been your end.\" I mentioned, in the best way I could, that I thought it was very stran ge that things alway s hap pened when he was around, an d that it was as if he had been concocting all the events himself. The times I had been alone in the wilderness at night had alway s been perfectly normal an d uneventful. I had never experienced shad ows or stran ge noises. In fact, I had never been frightened by an ything. Don Juan chuckled softly an d said that everything was proof he had enough personal power to call a myriad of things to his aid. I had the feeling he perhap s was hinting that he actually had called on some people as his confederates. Don Juan seemed to hav e read my thoughts an d lau gh ed out loud. \"Don't tax yourself with explan ations, \" he said. \"Wh at I said mak es no sense to you, simply becau se you still don't hav e enough personal power. Yet you hav e more than when you started, so things hav e begun to happen to you. You alread y had a powerful encounter with the fog an d lightning. It is not importan t that you understan d what hap pened to you that night. Wh at's importan t is that you hav e acqu ired the memory of it. The bridge an d everything else you saw that night will be repeated someday when you hav e enough personal power.\" \"For what purpose would all that be repeated, don Juan ?\" \"I don't know. I am not you. Only you can an swer that. We are all different. That's why I had to leav e you by yourself last night, although I knew it was mortall y dan gerous; you had to test yourself ag ainst those entities. The reason I chose the owl's cry was becau se owls are the entities' messengers. To imitate the cry of an owl brings them out. They becam e dan gerous to you not becau se they are naturally malevole nt but becau se you were not impeccab le. There is something in you that is very chintzy an d I know what it is. You arc just humoring me. You hav e been humoring everybody all along an d, of course, that places you au tomatically above everyone an d everything. But you know yourself that that can not be so. You are only a man , an d your life is too brief to encompass all the wonders an d all the horrors of this marvelous world. Therefore, your humoring is chintzy ; it cuts you down to a crap py size.\" I wan ted to prot est. Don Juan had nailed me, as he had done dozens of times before. For a moment I becam e an gry. But, as it had hap pened before, writing detached me enough so I could remain impassive. \"I think I hav e a cure for it, \" don Juan went on after a long interval . \"Even you would ag ree with me if you could remember what you did last night. You ran as fast as an y sorcerer only when your opponent becam e unbearab le. We both know that an d I believe I hav e alread y found a worthy opponent for you.\" \"Wh at are you going t o do, don Juan ?\""},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 143 He did not an swer. He stood up an d stretched his body. He seemed to contract every muscle.

Our fellow men, on the contrary, are relentless. \"We hav e talked long enough, \" don Juan said in an ab rupt tone an d turned to me. \"Before we leav e you must do one more thing, the most importan t of all. I am going to tell you something right now to set your mind at ease ab out why you are here. The reason you keep on coming to see me is very simple; every time you hav e seen me your body has learned certain things, even ag ainst your desire. And finally your body now needs to come back to me to lear n more. Let's say that your body knows that it is going to die, even though you never think about it. So I've been telling your body that I too am going to die an d before I do I would like to show your body certain things, things which you can not give to y our body yourself. For exam ple, your body needs fright. It likes it. Your body needs the darkness an d the wind. Your body now knows the gait of power an d can 't wait to try it. Your body needs personal power an d can 't wait to hav e it. So let's say then that your body returns to see me becau se I am its friend.\" Don Juan remained silent for a long while. He seemed to be struggling with his thoughts. \"I've told you that the secret of a strong body is not in what you do to it but in what you don't do, \" he final ly said. \"Now it is time for you not to do what you alway s do. Sit here until we leav e an d not - do.\" \"I don't follow you, don Juan .\" He put his han ds over my notes an d took them aw ay from me. He carefully closed the pag es of my notebook, secured it with its rubber ban d, an d then threw it like a disk far into the chap arral. I was shocked an d began to protest but he put his han d over my mouth. He pointed to a large bush an d told me to fix my attention not on the leav es but on the shadows of the leav es. He said that running in the darkness did not hav e to be spurred by fear but could be a very natural reaction of a jubilan t body that knew how \"to not do.\" He repeated over an d over in a whisper in my right ear that \"to not do what I knew how to do\" was the key to power.

The shad ows of the leav es or the spaces in between the leav es were never my concern. His last ad monitions were to start focusing on the shad ows of the leav es on one single bran ch an d then eventually work my way to the whole tree, an d not to let my eyes go back to the leav es, becau se the first deliberate step to storing personal power was to allow the body to \"not - do.\" Perhap s it was becau se of my fatigue or my nervous excitation, but I becam e so immersed in the shadows of the leav es that by the time don Juan stood up I could almost group the dark masses of shadows as effectively as I normally grouped the foliag e. The total effect was startling. I told don Juan that I would like to stay longer. He lau ghed an d patted me on my hat. \"I've told you, \" he said. \"The body likes things like this.\" He then said that I should let my stored power guide me through the bushes to my notebook. He gently pushed me into th e chap arral. I walked aimlessly for a moment an d then I cam e upon it. I thought that I must hav e unconsciously memorized the direction in which don Juan had thrown it. He explained the event, say ing that I went directly to the notebook becau se my body had been soak ed for hours in \"not - doing.\" "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 NOT - DOING We dnesday , April , 1962 Upon returning to his house, don Juan recommended that I work on my notes as if nothing had hap pened to me, an d not to mention or even be concerned with an y of the events I had expe rienced. After a day 's rest he an nounced that we had to leav e the area for a few day s becau se it was advisab le to put distan ce between us an d those \"entities.\" He said that they had affected me deeply, although I was not noticing their effect yet becau se m y body was not sensitive enough. In a short while, however, I would fall seriously ill if I did not go to my \"place of predilection\" to be clean sed an d restored. We left before dawn an d drove north, an d after an exhau sting drive an d a fast hike we arrived at the hilltop in the late afternoon. Don Juan , as he had done before, covered the spot where I had once slept with small bran ches an d leav es. Then he gav e me a han dful of leav es to put ag ainst the skin of my abdomen an d told me to lie down an d rest. He fi xed an other place for himself slightly to my left, about five feet aw ay from my head, an d also lay down. In a matter of minutes I began to feel an exqu isite warmth an d a sense of supreme well - being. It was a sense of physical comfort, a sensation of being suspended in mid - air. I could fully ag ree with don Juan 's statement that the \"bed of strings\" would keep me floating. I commented on the unbelievab le qu ality of my sensory experience. Don Juan said in a factual tone that the \"bed\" was mad e for that purpose . \"I can 't believe that this is possible!\" I exclaimed. Don Juan took my statement literally an d scolded me. He said he was tired of my acting as an ultimately importan t being that has to be given proof over an d over that the world is unknown an d marvelous . I tried to explain that a rhetorical exclam ation had no significan ce. He retorted that if that were so I could hav e chosen an other statement. It seemed that he was seriously an noyed with me.

I ended up lau ghing at the calculated ab surdity of some of his proposed alternatives. He giggled an d in a soft tone reminded me that I should ab an don myself to the sensation of floating. The soothing feeling of peace an d plenitude that I experienced in that mysterious place aroused some deeply buried emotions in me. I began to talk ab out my life. I confessed that I had never respected or liked a nybody, not even myself, an d that I had alway s felt I was inherently evil, an d thus my attitude towards others was always veiled with a certain brav ad o an d daring. \"True, \" don Juan said. \"You don't like yourself at all.\" He cackled an d told me that he had been \"seeing\" while I talked. His recommendation was that I should not hav e remorse for an ything I had done, becau se to isolate one's acts as being mean , or ugly, or evil was to place an unwarran ted importan ce on the self."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 I moved nervously an d the bed of leav es mad e a rustling sound.

He ad ded that in his \"seeing\" he had come across one of my moods. He st ruggled for a moment, seemingly to find a proper word, an d said that the mood in qu estion was a frame of mind I continually lap sed into. He described it as a sort of trap door that opened at unexpected times an d swallowed me. I asked him to be more specifi c. He replied that it was impossible to be specific ab out \"seeing.\" Before I could say an ything else he told me I should relax , but not fall asleep, an d be in a state of aw areness for as long as I could. He said that the \"bed of strings\" was mad e exclusive ly to allow a warrior to arrive at a certain state of peace an d well - being.

I thought perhap s I had eaten something bad . I heard don Juan talking to me but I did not really mak e an effort to listen. I was trying to mak e a mental inventory of all the things I had eaten that day , but I could not become interested in it.

The sky was totally free of clouds towards the west an d the sunlight was spectacular. Perhap s the fact that don Juan was cueing me mad e the yellowish glow of the afternoon s un truly mag nificent. \"Let that glow kindle you, \" don Juan said. \"Before the sun goes down today you must be perfectly calm an d restored, becau se tomorrow or the day after, you are going to learn not - doing.\" \"Learn not doing what?\" I asked. \"Never mind n ow, \" he said. \"Wa it until we are in those lav a mountains.\" He pointed to some distan t jagged, dark, menacing - looking peak s towards the north."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 Thursday , April 12, 1962 We reached the high desert around the lav a mountains in the late afternoon. In the dist an ce the dark brown lav a mountains looked almost sinister. The sun was very low on the horizo n an d shone on the western face of the solidified lav a, tinting its dark brownness with a dazz ling array of yellow reflections. I could not keep my eyes aw ay. Thos e peak s were truly mesmerizing. By the end of the day the bottom slopes of the mountains were in sight. There was very little vegetation on the high desert; all I could see were cacti an d a kind of tall grass that grew in tufts. Don Juan stopped to rest. H e sat down, carefully propped his food gourds ag ainst a rock, an d said that we were going to cam p on that spot for the night. He had picked a relatively high place. From where I stood I could see qu ite a distan ce aw ay , all around us. It was a cloudy day an d the twilight qu ickly enveloped the area. I becam e involved in watching the speed with which the crimson clouds on the west faded into a uniform thick dark gray . Don Juan got up an d went to the bushes. By the time he cam e back the silhouette of the lav a m ountains was a dark mass. He sat down next to me an d called my attention to what seemed to be a natural formation on the mountains towards the northeast. It was a spot which had a color much lighter than its surroundings. Wh ile the whole ran ge of lav a moun tains looked uniformly dark brown in the twilight, the spot he was pointing at was actually yellowish or dark beige. I could not figure out what it could be. I stared at it for a long time. It seemed to be moving; I fan cied it to be pulsating. Wh en I squ in ted my eyes it actually rippled as if the wind were moving it. \"Look at it fixedly!\" don Juan comman ded me. At one moment, after I had maintained my stare for qu ite a while, I felt that the whole ran ge of mountains was moving towards me. That feeling was a ccompan ied by an unusual ag itation in the pit of my stomach. The discomfort becam e so acute that I stood up. \"Sit down!\" don Juan yelled, but I was alread y on my feet. From my new point of view the yellowish formation was lower on the side of the mountains , I sat down ag ain, without tak ing my eyes away , an d the formation shifted to a higher place. I stared at it for an instan t an d suddenly I arran ged everything into the correct perspective. I realized that what I had been looking at was not in the mountains at all but was really a piece of yellowish green cloth han ging from a tall cactus in front of me. I lau ghed out loud an d explained to don Juan that the twilight had helped to create an optical illusion. He got up an d walked to the place where the piece of cloth was han ging, took it down, folded it, an d put it inside his pouch. \"Wh at are you doing that for?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 \"Becau se this piece of cloth has power, \" he said casually. \"For a moment you were doing fine with it an d there is no way of knowing what may hav e hap pened if you had remained seated.\" Friday, April 75, 1962 At the crack of daw n we head ed for the mountains. They were surprisingly far away . By midday we walked into one of the can yons. There was some water in shallow pools. We sat to rest in t he shad e of a han ging cliff. The mountains were clumps of a monumental lav a flow. The solidified lav a had weathered over the millennia into a porous dark brown rock. Only a few sturdy weeds grew between the rocks an d in the cracks. Looking up at the almost perpendicular walls of the can yon, I had a weird sensation in the pit of my stomach. The walls were hundreds of feet high an d gav e me the feeling that they were closing in on me. The sun was almost overhead , slightly towards the southwest. \"Stan d up here, \" don Juan said an d man euvered my body until I was looking towards the sun. He told me to look fixedly at the mountain walls ab ove me. The sight was stupendous. The mag nificent height of the lav a flow stag gered my imag ination. I began to wonder what a vol can ic upheav al it must hav e been. I looked up an d down the sides of the can yon various times. I becam e immersed in the richness of color in the rock wall. There were specks of every conceivab le hue. There were patches of light gray moss or lichen in every rock. I looked right ab ove my head an d noticed that the sunlight was producing the most exqu isite reflections when it hit the brillian t specks of the solidified lav a. I stared at an area in the mountains where the sunlight was being reflected. As the sun m oved, the intensity diminished, then it fad ed completely. I looked across the can yon an d saw an other area of the sam e exqu isite light refractions. I told don Juan what was hap pening, an d then I spotted an other area of light, an d then an other in a different place, an d an other, until the whole can yon was blotched with big patches of light. I felt dizzy ; even if I closed my eyes I could still see the brillian t lights. I held my head in my han ds an d tried to crawl under the han ging cliff, but don Juan grab bed m y arm firmly an d imperatively told me to look at the walls of the mountains an d try to figure out spots of heav y darkness in the midst of the fields of light. I did not wan t to look, becau se the glare bothered my eyes. I said that what was hap pening to me was similar to staring into a sunny street through a window an d then seeing the window fram e as a dark silhouette everywhere else. Don Juan shook his head from side to side an d began to chuckle. He let go of my arm an d we sat down ag ain under the han ging c liff."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149 I was jotting down my impressions of the surroundings when don Juan , after a long silence, suddenly spoke in a dram atic tone. \"I hav e brought you here to teach you one thing, \" he said an d pau sed. \"You are going to learn not - doing. We might as well t alk ab out it becau se there is no other way for you to proceed. I thought you might catch on to not - doing without my hav ing to say an ything.

I closed my notebook, but to my am aze ment he insisted that I should keep on writing. \"Not - doing is so difficult an d so powerful that you should not mention it, \" he went on. \"Not until you h av e stopped the world; only then can you talk ab out it freely, if that's what you'd wan t to do.\" Don Juan looked around an d then pointed to a large rock. \"That rock over there is a rock becau se of doing\" he said. We looked at each other an d he smiled. I wa ited for an explan ation but he remained silent. Finally I had to say that I had not understood what he mean t. \"That's doing!\" he exclaimed. \"Pardon me?\" \"That's also doing.\" \"Wh at are you talking ab out, don Juan ?\" \"Doing is what mak es that rock a rock an d that bush a bush. Doing is what mak es you yourself an d me myself.\" I told him that his explan ation did not explain an ything. He lau ghed an d scratched his temples. \"That's the problem with talking, \" he said. \"It alway s mak es one confuse the issues. If one starts talking about doing, one alway s ends up talking about something else. It is better to just act. \"Tak e that rock for instan ce. To look at it is doing, but to see it is not - doing\" I had to confess that his words were not mak ing sense to me. \"Oh yes th ey do!\" he exclaimed. \"But you are convinced that they don't becau se that is your doing. That is the way you act towards me an d the world.\""},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 He ag ain pointed to the rock. \"That rock is a rock becau se of all the things you know how to do to it, \" he said. \"I call that doing. A man of knowledge, for instan ce, knows that the rock is a rock only becau se of doing, so if he doesn't wan t the rock to be a rock all he has to do is not - doing. See what I mean ?\" I did not understan d him at all. He lau ghed and mad e an oth er attempt at explaining. \"The world is the world becau se you know the doing involved in mak ing it so, \" he said. \"If you didn't know its doing, the world would be different.\" He exam ined me with curiosity. I stopped writing. I just wan ted to listen to him . He went on explaining that without that certain \"doing\" there would be nothing fam iliar in the surroundings. He lean ed over an d picked up a small rock between the thumb an d index of his left han d an d held it in front of my eyes. \"This is a pebble becau se you know the doing involved in mak ing it into a pebble, \" he said. \"Wh at are you say ing?\" I asked with a feeling of bona fide confusion. Don Juan smiled. He seemed to be trying to hide a mischievous delight. \"I don't know why you are so confused, \" he sai d. \"Wo rds are your predilection. You should be in heav en.\" He gav e me a mysterious look an d raised his brows two or three times. Then he pointed ag ain to the small rock he was holding in front of my eyes. \"I say that you are mak ing this into a pebble becau se you know the doing involved in it, \" he said. \"Now, in order to stop the world you must stop doing.\" He seemed to know that I still had not understood an d smiled, shaking his head . He then took a twig an d pointed to the uneven edge of the pebble. \"In t he case of this little rock, \" he went on, \"the first thing which doing does to it is to shrink it to this size. So the proper thing to do, which a warrior does if he wan ts to stop the world, is to enlarge a little rock, or an y other thing, by not - doing.\" He stood up an d placed the pebble on a boulder an d then asked me to come closer an d exam ine it. He told me to look at the holes an d depressions in the pebble an d try to pick out the minute detail in them. He said that if I could pick out the detail, the ho les an d depressions would disap pear an d I would understan d what \"not - doing\" mean t. \"This dam n pebble is going to drive you crazy today , \" he said. I must hav e had a look of bewilderment on my face. He looked at me an d lau ghed uproariously. Then he pretende d to get an gry with the pebble an d hit it two or three times with his hat. I urged him to clarify his point. I argued that it was possible for him to explain an ything he wan ted to if he mad e an effort."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 151 He gav e me a sly glan ce an d shook his head as if the s ituation were hopeless. \"Sure I can explain an ything, \" he said, lau ghing. \"But could you understan d it?\" I was tak en ab ack by his insinuation. \"Doing mak es you separate the pebble from the larger boulder, \" he continued. \"If you wan t to learn not - doing, l et's say that you hav e to join them.\" He pointed to the small shad ow that the pebble cast on the boulder an d said that it was not a shad ow but a glue which bound them together. He then turned around an d walked aw ay , saying that he was coming back to check on me later. I stared at the pebble for a long time. I could not focus my attention on the minute detail in the holes an d depressions, but the tiny shad ow that the pebble cast on the boulder becam e a most interesting point. Don Juan was right; it was like a glue. It moved an d shifted. I had the impression it was being squ eezed from underneath the pebble. Wh en don Juan returned I related to him what I had observed ab out the shad ow. \"That's a good beginning, \" he said. \"A warrior can tell all kinds of things from the shad ows.\" He then suggested that I should take the pebble an d bury it somewhere. \"Wh y?\" I asked. \"You've been watching it for a long time,\" he said. \"It has something of you now. A warrior always tries to affect the force of doing by chan ging it i nto not - doing. Doing would be to leav e the pebble lying around becau se it is merely a small rock. Not - doing would be to proceed with that pebble as if it were something far beyond a mere rock. In this case, that pebble has soak ed in you for a long time an d now it is you, an d as such, you can not leav e it lying around but must bury it. If you would hav e personal power, however, not - doing would be to chan ge that pebble into a power object.\" \"Can I do that now?\" \"Your life is not tight enough to do that. If you would see, you would know that your heav y concern has chan ged that pebble into something qu ite unap pealing, therefore the best thing you can do is to dig a hole an d bury it an d let the earth absorb its heav iness.\" \"Is all this true, don Juan ?\" \"To say yes or no to your qu estion is doing. But since you are learning not - doing I hav e to tell you that it really doesn't matter whether or not all this is true. It is here that a warrior has a point of advan tag e over the av erag e man . An av erage man cares that thin gs are either true or false, but a warrior doesn't. An av erag e man proceeds in a specific way with things that he knows are true, an d in a different way with things that he knows are not true. If things are said to be true, he acts and believes in what he does. But if things are said to be untrue, he doesn't care to act, or he doesn't believe in what he does. A warrior, on the other han d, acts in both instan ces. If things are said to be true, he would act in order to do doing. If things are said to be untru e, he still would act in order to do not - doing. See what I mean ?\""},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 152 \"No, I don't see what you mean at all, \" I said. Don Juan 's statements put me in a belligerent mood. I could not mak e sense of what he was say ing.

He actually mad e fun of my verbal comman d an d found it fau lty an d inad equ ate. \"If you are going to be all mouth, be a mouth warrior, \" he said an d roared wi th lau ghter. I felt dejected. My ears were buzzi ng. I experienced an uncomfortab le heat in my head . I was actually embarrassed an d presumab ly red in the face. I stood up an d went into the chap arral an d buried the pebble. \"I was teasing you a little bit, \" don Juan said when I returned an d sat down ag ain. \"And yet I know that if you don't talk you don't understan d. Talking is doing for you, but talking is not ap propriate an d if you wan t to know what I mean by not - doing you hav e to do a simple exercise. Since we are concerned with not - doing it doesn't matter whether you do the exercise now or ten years from now.\" He mad e me lie down an d took my right arm an d bent it at my elbow. Then he turned my han d until the palm was facing the front; he curved my fingers s o my han d looked as if I were holding a doorknob, an d then he began to move my arm back an d forth with a circular motion that resembled the act of pushing an d pulling a lever attached to a wheel. Don Juan said that a warrior executed that movement every ti me he wan ted to push something out of his body, something like a disease or an unwelcome feeling. The idea was to push an d pull an imaginary opposing force until one felt a heav y object, a solid body, stopping the free movements of the han d. In the case of the exercise, \"not - doing\" consisted in repeating it until one felt the heav y body with the han d, in spite of the fact that one could never believe it was possible to feel it. I began moving my arm an d in a short while my han d becam e ice cold. I had begun to feel a sort of mushiness around my han d. It was as if I were pad dling through some heav y viscous liqu id matter. Don Juan mad e a sudden movement an d grabbed my arm to stop the motion. My whole body shivered as though stirred by some unseen force. He scru tinized me as I sat up, an d then walked around me before he sat back down on the place where he had been. \"You've done enough, \" he said. \"You may do this exercise some other time, when you hav e more personal power.\" \"Did I do something wrong?\" \"No. Not - do ing is only for very strong warriors an d you don't hav e the power to deal with it yet. Now you will only trap horrendous things with your han d. So do it little by little, until your han d doesn't get cold an y more. Wh enever your han d remains warm you can ac tually feel the lines of. the world with it.\" He pau sed as if to give me time to ask ab out the lines. But before I had a chan ce to, he started explaining that there were infinite numbers of lines that joined us to things. He said that the exercise of \"not - doing\" that he had just described would help an yone to feel a"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 153 line that cam e out from the moving han d, a line that one could place or cast wherever one wan ted to. Don Juan said that this was only an exercise, becau se the lines formed by the han d were not d urable enough to be of real value in a practical situation. \"A man of knowledge uses other parts of his body to produce durab le lines, \" he said. \"Wh at parts of the body, don Juan ?\" \"The most durable lines that a man of knowledge produces come from the mid dle of the body,\" he said. \"But he can also mak e them with his eyes.\" \"Are they real lines?\" \"Surely.\" \"Can you see them an d touch them?\" \"Let's say that you can feel them. The most difficult part ab out the warrior's way is to realize that the world is a f eeling. Wh en one is not - doing, one is feeling the world, an d one feels the world through its lines.\" He pau sed an d exam ined me with curiosity. He raised his brows an d opened his eyes an d then blinked. The effect was like the eyes of a bird blinking. Almost immediately I felt a sensation of discomfort an d qu easiness. It was actually as if something was ap plying pressure to my stomach. \"See what I mean ?\" don Juan asked an d moved his eyes away . I mentioned that I felt nau seated an d he replied in a matter - of - fa ct tone that he knew it, an d that he was trying to mak e me feel the lines of the world with his eyes. I could not accept the claim that he himself was mak ing me feel that way . I voiced my doubts. I could hardly conceive the idea that he was cau sing my feel ing of nau sea, since he had not, in an y physical way , impinged on me. \"Not - doing is very simple but very difficult, \" he said. \"It is not a matter of understan ding it but of mastering it. Seeing, of course, is the final accomplishment of a man of knowledge , .an d seeing is attained only when one has stopped the world through the techniqu e of not - doing.\" I smiled involuntarily. I had not understood what he mean t. \"Wh en one does something with people, \" he said, \"the concern should be only with presenting the case to their bodies. That's what I've been doing with you so far, letting your body know. Wh o cares whether or not you understan d?\" \"But that's unfair, don Juan . I wan t to understan d everything, otherwise coming here would be a waste of my time.\" \"A waste of your time!\" he exclaimed parodying my tone of voice. \"You certainly are conceited.\" He stood up an d told me that we were going to hike to the top of the lav a peak to our right. The ascent to the top was an excruciating affair. It was actual mountain cl imbing, except that there were no ropes to aid an d protect us. Don Juan repeatedly told me not to look down; an d he had to actually pull me up bodily a couple of times, after I"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 had begun to slide down the rock. I felt terribly embarrassed that don Juan , be ing so old, had to help me. I told him that I was in poor physical condition becau se I was too lazy to do an y exercise. He replied that once one had arrived at a certain level of personal power, exercise or an y training of that sort was unnecessary, since all one needed, to be in an impeccab le form, was to engag e oneself in \"not - doing.\" Wh en we arrived at the top I lay down. I was ab out to be sick. He rolled me back an d forth with his foot as he had done once before. Little by little the motion restored my balan ce. But I felt nervous. It was as if I were somehow waiting for the sudden ap pearan ce of something. I involuntarily looked two or three times to each side. Don Juan did not say a word but he also looked in the direction I was looking. \"Shad ows are pec uliar affairs, \" he said all of a sudden. \"You must hav e noticed that there is one following us.\" \"I hav en't noticed an ything of the sort, \" I protested in a loud voice. Don Juan said that my body had noticed our pursuer, in spite of my stubborn opposition , an d assured me in a confident tone that there was nothing unusual ab out being followed by a shad ow. \"It is just a power, \" he said. \"These mountains are filled with them. It is just like one of those entities that scared you the other night.\" I wan ted to know if I could actually perceive it myself. He asserted that in the day time I could only feel its presence. I wan ted an explan ation of why he called it a shad ow when obviously it was not like the shad ow of a boulder. He replied that both had the sam e lin es, therefore both were shad ows. He pointed to a long boulder stan ding directly in front of us. \"Look at the shadow of that boulder, \"He said. \"The shad ow is the boulder, an d yet it isn't. To observe the boulder in order to know what the boulder is, is doi ng, but to observe its shad ow is not - doing. \"Shad ows are like doors, the doors of not - doing. A man of knowledge, for exam ple, can tell the innermost feelings of men by watching their shad ows.\" \"Is there movement in them?\" I asked. \"You may say that there i s movement in them, or you may say that the lines of the world are shown in them, or you may say that feelings come from them.\" \"But how could feelings come out of shad ows, don Juan ?\" \"To believe that shad ows are just shad ows is doing\" he explained. \"That belief is somehow stupid. Think about it this way : There is so much more to everything in the world that obviously there must be more to shad ows too. After all, what mak es them shad ows is merely our doing.\""},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 155 There was a long silence. I did not know what els e to say . \"The end of the day is ap proaching, \" don Juan said, looking at the sky. \"You hav e to use this brillian t sunlight to perform one last exercise.\" He led me to a place where there were two peak s the size of a man stan ding parallel to each other, ab out four or five feet ap art. Don Juan stopped ten yards aw ay from them, facing the west. He marked a spot for me to stan d on an d told me to look at the shad ows of the peak s. He said that I should watch them an d cross my eyes in the sam e man ner I ordinarily crossed them when scan ning the ground for a place to rest. He clarified his directions by say ing that when searching for a resting place one had to look without focusing but in observing shad ows one had to cross the eyes an d yet keep a sharp imag e in focu s. The idea was to let one shad ow be superimposed on the other by crossing the eyes. He explained that through that process one could ascertain a certain feeling which eman ated from shad ows. I commented on his vag ueness, but he maintained that there was re ally no way of describing what he mean t. My attempt to carry out the exercise was futile. I struggled until I got a headache. Don Juan was not at all concerned with my failure. He climbed to a dome like peak an d yelled from the top, telling me to look for two small long an d narrow pieces of rock. He showed with his han ds the size rock he wan ted. I found two pieces an d han ded them to him. Don Juan placed each rock ab out a foot ap art in two crevices, made me stan d ab ove them facing the west, an d told me to do the sam e exercise with their shad ows. This time it was an altogether different affair. Almost immediately I was cap ab le of crossing my eyes an d perceiving their individual shad ows as if they had merged into one. I noticed that the act of looking without c onverging the imag es gav e the single shad ow I had formed an unbelievab le depth an d a sort of tran sparency. I stared at it, bewildered. Every hole in the rock, on the area where my eyes were focused, was neatly discernible; an d the composite shad ow, which w as superimposed on them, was like a film of indescribab le tran sparency. I did not wan t to blink, for fear of losing the imag e I was so precariously holding. Finally my sore eyes forced me to blink, but I did not lose the view of the detail at all. In fact, by remoistening my cornea the imag e becam e even clearer. I noticed at that point that it was as if I were looking from an immeasurable height at a world I had never seen before. I also noticed that I could scan the surroundings of the shad ow without losin g the focus of my visual perception. Then, for an instan t, I lost the notion that I was looking at a rock. I felt that I was lan ding in a world, vast beyond an ything I had ever conceived. This extrao rdinary perception lasted for a second and then everythin g was turned off. I au tomatically looked up an d saw don Juan stan ding directly above the rocks, facing me. He had blocked the sunlight with his body. I described the unusual sensation I had had , an d he explained that he had been forced to interrupt it beca use he \"saw \" that I was about to get lost in it. He added that it was a natural tendency for all of us to indulge ourselves when feelings of that nature occur, an d that by indulging myself in it I had almost turned \"not - doing\" into my old fam iliar \"doing.\" He said that what I should hav e done was to maintain the view without succumbing to it, becau se in a way \"doing\" was a man ner of succumbing."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 I complained that he should hav e told me beforehan d what to expect an d what to do, but he pointed out that he had no way of knowing whether or not I would succeed in merging the shad ows. I had to confess I was more mystified than ever ab out \"not - doing.\" Don Juan 's comments were that I should be satisfied with what I had done, becau se for once I had proceeded correctly , that by reducing the world I had enlarged it, an d that, although I had been far from feeling the lines of the world, I had correctly used the shadow of the rocks as a door into \"not - doing.\" The statement that I had enlarged the world by reducing it intri gued me to no end. The detail of the porous rock, in the small area where my eyes were focused, was so vivid an d so precisely defined that the top of the round peak becam e a vast world for me; an d yet it was really a reduced vision of the rock. Wh en don Ju an blocked the light an d I found myself looking as I normally would do, the precise detail becam e dull, the tiny holes in the porous rock becam e bigger, the brown color of the dried lav a becam e opaqu e, an d everything lost the shiny tran sparency that mad e t he rock into a real world. Don Juan then took the two rocks, laid them gently into a deep crevice, an d sat down cross - legged facing the west, on the spot where the rocks had been. He patted a spot next to him to his left an d told me to sit down. We did not speak for a long time. Then we ate, also in silence. It was only after the sun had set that he suddenly turned an d asked me ab out my progress in \"dream ing.\" I told him that it had been easy in the beginning, but that at the moment I had ceased altogether to find my han ds in my dream s. \"Wh en you first started dream ing you were using my personal power, that's why it was easier, \" he said. \"Now you are empty. But you must keep on trying until you hav e enough power of your own. You see, dream ing is the not - doi ng of dream s, an d as you progress in your not - doing you will also progress in dream ing. The trick is not to stop looking for your han ds, even if you don't believe that what you are doing has an y mean ing. In fact, as I hav e told you before, a warrior doesn 't need to believe, becau se as long as he keeps on acting without believing he is not - doing.\" We looked at each other for a moment. \"There is nothing else I can tell you ab out dream ing.\" he continued. \"Everything I may say would only be not - doing. But if you tackle not - doing directly, you yourself would know what to do in dream ing. To find your han ds is essential, though, at this time, an d I am sure you will.\" \"I don't know, don Juan . I don't trust myself.\" \"This is not a matter of trusting an ybody.

I assured him that I was not scorning an ything or an yone, but that I was more nervous an d incompetent than he thought. \"I've alway s been that way , \" I said. \"And yet I wan t to chan ge, but I don't know how.

I casually mentioned that it was going to tak e us at least a couple o f day s to get to his house. He said he was not going back to Sonora but to a border town where he had some business to tak e care of. I thought we were going to start our descent through a water can yon but don Juan headed towards the northwest on the high p lateau s of the lav a mountains. After ab out an hour of walking he led me into a deep rav ine, which ended at a point where two peak s almost joined. There was a slope there, going almost to the top of the ran ge, a stran ge slope which looked like a slan ted con cav e bridge between the two peak s. Don Juan pointed to an area on the face of the slope. \"Look there fixedly, \" he said. \"The sun is almost right.\" He explained that at midday the light of the sun could help me with \"not - doing.\" He then gav e me a series of comman ds: to loosen all the tight garments I had on, to sit in a cross - legged position, an d to look intently at the spot he had specified. There were very few clouds in the sky an d none towards the west. It was a hot day an d the sunlight beam ed on the sol idified lav a. I kept a very close watch over the area in qu estion. After a long vigil I asked what, specifically, I was supposed to look for. He made me be qu iet with an impatient gesture of his han d. I was tired. I wan ted to go to sleep. I half closed my eyes; they were itching an d I rubbed them, but my han ds were clam my an d the sweat mad e my eyes sting. I looked at the lav a peak s through half - closed eyelids an d suddenly the whole mountain was lit up. I told don Juan that if I squ inted my eyes I could see the whole ran ge of mountains as an intricate array of light fibers. He told me to breathe as little as possible in order to maintain the view of the light fibers, an d not to stare intently into it but to look casually at a point on the horizo n right ab ove the slope. I followed his instructions an d was ab le to hold the view of an interminab le extension covered with a web of light. Don Juan said in a very soft voice that I should try to isolate areas of darkness within the field of light fibers, an d that righ t after finding a dark spot I should open my eyes an d check where that spot was on the face of the slope. I was incap ab le of perceiving an y dark areas. I squ inted my eyes an d then opened them up various times. Don Juan drew closer to me an d pointed to an a rea to my right, an d then to smother one right in front of me. I tried to chan ge the position of my body; I thought that perhap s if I shifted my perspective I would be able to perceive the supposed area of darkness he was pointing to, but don Juan shook my arm an d told me in a severe tone to keep still an d be patient."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 15 9 I ag ain squ inted my eyes an d once more saw the web of light fibers. I looked at it for a moment an d then I opened my eyes wider. At that instan t I heard a faint rumble - it could hav e easily b een explained as the distan t sound of a jet plan e - an d then, with my eyes wide open, I saw the whole ran ge of mountains in front of me as an enormous field of tiny dots of light. It was as if for a brief moment some metallic specks in the solidified lav a were reflecting the sunlight in unison. Then the sunlight grew dim an d was suddenly turned off an d the mountains becam e a mass of dull dark brown rock an d at the sam e time it also becam e windy an d cold. I wan ted to turn around to see if the sun had disap pe ared behind a cloud but don Juan held my head an d did not let me move. He said that if I turned I might catch a glimpse of an entity of the mountains, the ally that was following us. He assured me that I did not hav e the necessary strength to stan d a sight of that nature, an d then he ad ded in a calculated tone that the rumble I had heard was the peculiar way in which an ally heralded its presence. He then stood up an d announced that we were going to start climbing up the side of the slope. \"Wh ere are we goi ng?\" I asked. He pointed to one of the areas he had isolated as being a spot of darkness. He explained that \"not - doing\" had allowed him to single out that spot as a possible center of power, or perhap s as a place where power objects might be found. We reac hed the spot he had in mind after a painful climb. He stood motionless for a moment a few feet in front of me. I tried to come closer to him but he signaled me with his han d to stop. He seemed to be orienting himself. I could see the back of his head movin g as if he were sweeping his eyes up an d down the mountain, then with sure steps he led the way to a ledge. He sat down an d began to wipe some loose dirt off the ledge with his han d. He dug with his fingers around a small piece of rock that was sticking ou t, clean ing the dirt around it. Then he ordered me to dig it out. Once I had dislodged the piece of rock, he told me to immediately put it inside my shirt becau se it was a power object that belonged to me. He said that he was giving it to me to keep, an d t hat I should polish an d care for it. Right after that we began our descent into a water can yon, an d a couple of hours later we were in the high desert at the foot of the lava mountains. Don Juan walked ab out ten feet ah ead of me an d kept up a very good pac e. We went south until just before sunset.

Once I engag ed them in conversation they were very friendly an d communicative, especially the one who had first spoken to me. They told me they were there in search of power qu artz crystals. They said that they had been wan dering around the lav a mountains for several day s but they had not had an y luck. Don Juan looked around an d pointed to a rocky area ab out two hundred yards aw ay . \"That's a good place to cam p for a while, \" he said. He began to walk towards the rocks an d we all followed him. The area he had selected was very rugged. There were n o bushes on it. We sat down on the rocks. Don Juan an nounced that he was going to go back into the chap arral to gather dry bran ches for a fire. I wan ted to help him, but he whispered to me that this was a special fire for those brav e young men and he did n ot need my help. The young men sat down around me in a close cluster. One of them sat with his back ag ainst mine. I felt a bit embarrassed. Wh en don Juan returned with a pile of sticks, he commended them for their carefulness an d told me that the young men were a sorcerer's ap prentices, an d that it was the rule to mak e a circle an d hav e two people back to back in the center when going on hunting parties for power objects. One of the young men asked me if I had ever found an y crystals myself. I told him that don Juan had never tak en me to look for them. Don Juan selected a place close to a big boulder an d started to mak e a fire. None of the young men moved to help him but watched him attentively. Wh en all the sticks were burning, don Juan sat with his back ag ainst the boulder. The fire was to his right. The young men ap parently knew what was going on, but I did not hav e the faintest idea about the procedure to follow when one was dealing with sorcerer's ap prentices. I watched the young men. They sat facing don Juan , mak ing a perfect half circle. I noticed then that don Juan was directly facing me an d two of the young men had sat to my left an d the other two to my right. Don Juan began telling them that I was in the lav a mountains to learn \"not - doing\" an d that a n ally had been following us. I thought that that was a very dram atic beginning an d I was right. The young men chan ged positions an d sat with their left legs tucked under their seats. I had not observed how they were sitting before. I had assumed that they were sitting the sam e way I was, cross - legged. A casual glan ce at don Juan revealed to me that he was also sitting with his left leg tucked in. He mad e a barely perceptible gesture with his chin to point at my sitting position. I casually tucked in my lef t leg. Don Juan had once told me that that was the posture that a sorcerer used when things were uncertain. It had alway s proved, however, to be a very tiring position for me.

He said that ordinarily qu artz crystals were found in clusters, an d that it was up to the man who h ad found them to choose five of the longest an d best - looking blades of qu artz an d sever them from their matrix. The finder was responsible for carving an d polishing them in order to mak e them pointed an d to mak e them fit perfectly to the size an d shap e of the fingers of his right han d. Then he told us that the qu artz crystals were weap ons used for sorcery, that they were usually hurled to kill, an d that they penetrated the enemy's body an d then returned to their owner's han d as though they had never left it . Next he talked ab out the search for the spirit that would turn the ordinary crystals into weap ons an d said that the first thing one had to do was to find a propitious place to lure out the spirit. That place had to be on a hilltop an d was found by sweepi ng the han d, with the palm turned towards the earth, until a certain heat was detected with the palm of the han d. A fire had to be made on that spot. Don Juan explained that the ally was attracted by the flam es an d man ifested itself through a series of con sistent noises. The person searching for an ally had to follow the direction of the noises until the ally revealed itself, an d then wrestle it to the ground in order to overpower it. It was at that point that one could mak e the ally touch the crystals to i mbue them with power. He warned us that there were other forces at large in those lav a mountains, forces which did not resemble the allies; they did not mak e an y noise, but ap peared only as fleeting shad ows, an d did not hav e an y power at all. Don Juan adde d that a brillian tly colored feather or some highly polished qu artz crystals would attract the attention of an ally, but in the long run an y object whatever would be equ ally effective, becau se the importan t part was not to find the objects but to find the force that would imbue them with power. \"Wh at's the use of hav ing beau tifully polished crystals if you never find the spirit giver of power?\" he said. \"On the other han d, if you don't hav e the crystals but do find the spirit you may put an ything in his way to be touched. You could put your dicks in the way if you can 't find an ything else.\" The young men giggled. The most daring of them, the one who talked to me first, lau ghed loudly. I noticed that don Juan had crossed his legs an d was sitting in a relaxed man ner. All the young men had also crossed their legs. I tried to slip casually into a more relax ed posture, but my left knee seemed to hav e a pinched nerve or a sore muscle an d I had to stan d up an d jog on the spot for a few minutes. Don Juan mad e a jokin g comment.

They lau ghed in spurts. Some of them covered their f aces an d giggled nervously. \"I'm going to show you fellows something, \" don Juan said casually after the young men had stopped lau ghing. My guess was that he was going to let us see some power objects he had in his pouch. For an instan t I thought the young men were going to cluster around him, for they mad e a sudden movement in unison. All of them bent forward a little bit, as if they were going to stan d up, but then they all tucked their left legs in an d went back to that mysterious position that was so ha rd on my knees. I tucked my left leg in as casually as possible. I found that if I did not sit on my left foot, that is, if I kept a half kneeling position, my knees did not hurt as much. Don Juan stood up an d walked around the big boulder until he was out of sight. He must hav e fed the fire before he stood up, while I was tucking in my leg, for the new sticks chirped as they ignited an d long flam es spurted out. The effect was extremely dram atic. The flam es grew twice as big. Don Juan suddenly stepped out f rom behind the boulder an d stood where he had been sitting. I had a moment of bewilderment. Don Juan had put on a funny black hat. It had peak s on the side, by the ears, an d it was round on top. It occurred to me that it was actually a pirate's hat. He was wearing a long black coat with tails, fastened with a single shiny metallic button, an d he had a peg leg. I lau ghed to myself. Don Juan really looked silly in his pirate's costume. I began to wonder where he had gotten that outfit out there in the wildern ess. I assumed that it must hav e been hidden behind the rock. I commented to myself that all don Juan needed was a patch over his eye an d a parrot on his shoulder to be the perfect stereotype of a pirate. Don Juan looked at every member of the group, sweep ing his eyes slowly from right to left. Then he looked up ab ove us an d stared into the darkness behind us. He remained in that position for a moment an d then he went around the boulder an d disap peared. I did not notice how he walked. Obviously he must hav e had his knee bent in order to depict a man with a wooden leg; when he turned around to walk behind the boulder I should hav e seen his bent leg, but I was so mystified by his acts that I did not pay an y attention to details. The flam es lost their strength at the very moment don Juan went around the boulder. I thought that his timing had been superb; he must hav e calculated how long it would tak e for the sticks he had ad ded to the fire to burn an d had arran ged his ap pearan ce an d exit according to that calcu lation. The chan ge in the intensity of the fire was very dram atic for the group; there was a ripple of nervousness am ong the young men. As the flam es diminished in size the young men went back in unison to a cross - legged sitting position. I expected don J uan to step out from behind the boulder right aw ay an d sit down ag ain but he did not. He remained out of sight. I waited impatiently.

They looked at each other seemingly in utter confusion. I said that to me th e hat an d the stump an d the coat mad e him into a pirate. By then all four young men had come closer together around me. They giggled softly an d fretted nervously. They seemed to be at a loss for words. The most daring of them finally spoke to me. He said t hat don Juan did not hav e a hat on, was not wearing a long coat, an d was certainly not stan ding on a stump, but that he had a black cowl or shaw l over his head an d a jet black tunic, like a friar's, that went all the way to the ground. \"No!\" an other young man exclaimed softly. \"He didn't hav e a cowl.\" \"That's right, \" the others said. The young man who had spoken first looked at me with an expression of total disbelief. I told them that we had to review what had hap pened very carefully an d very qu ietly, an d that I was sure don Juan had wan ted us to do so an d thus he had left us alone. The young man who was to my extreme right said that don Juan was in rag s. He had on a tattered poncho, or some sort of Indian coat, an d a most beat - up sombrero. He was holding a basket with things in it, but he was not sure what those things were. He added that don Juan was not really dressed as a beggar but rather as a man who was coming back from an interminab le journey load ed with stran ge things. The young man who had seen do n Juan with a black cowl said that he had nothing in his han ds but that his hair was long an d wild, as if he were a wild man that had just killed a friar an d had put on his clothes but could not hide his wildness. The young man to my left chuckled softly a nd commented on the weirdness of it all. He said that don Juan was dressed as an importan t man who had just gotten off his horse. He had leather leggings for horseback riding, big spurs, a whip that he kept beating on his left palm, a Chihuah ua hat with a conical crown, an d two .45 - caliber au tomatic pistols. He said that don Juan was the picture of a well - to - do \"ran chero.\" The young man to my extreme left lau ghed shyly an d did not volunteer to reveal what he had seen. I coax ed him, but the others did not se em to be interested. He ap peared to be rather too shy to talk. The fire was ab out to be extinguished when don Juan cam e out from behind the boulder. \"We better leav e the young men to their doings, \" he said to me. \"Bid them goodbye.\" He did not look at the m. He began to walk away slowly to give me time to say goodbye. The young men embraced me. There were no flam es in the fire, but the live coals reflected enough glare.

I am rational, so what?\" I involved him in the argument of why it was necessary for two rational beings to proceed in such an insan e way , as we had proceeded with the lad y witch. \"You're rational, al l right, \" he said fiercely. \"And that mean s you believe that you know a lot ab out the world, but do you? Do you really? You hav e only seen the acts of people. Your experiences are limited only to what people hav e done to you or to others. You know nothing ab out this mysterious unknown world.\" He signaled me to follow him to my car an d we drove to the small Mexican town nearby. I did not ask what we were going to do. He mad e me park my car by a restau ran t an d then we walked around the bus depot an d the gene ral store. Don Juan walked on my right side, leading me. Suddenly I becam e aw are that someone else was walking side by side with me to my left, but before I had time to turn to look, don Juan made a fast an d sudden movement; he lean ed forward, as if he wer e picking something from the ground, an d then grabbed me by the armpit when I nearly stumbled over him. He drag ged me to my car an d did not let go of my arm even to allow me to unlock the door. I fumbled with the keys for a moment. He shoved me gently into the car an d then got in himself. \"Drive slowly an d stop in front of the store, \" he said. Wh en I had stopped, don Juan signaled me with a nod of his head to look. \"La Catalina\" was stan ding at the place where don Juan had grabbed me. I recoiled involuntar ily. The woman took a couple of steps towards the car an d stood there defian tly. I scrutinized her carefully an d concluded that she was a beau tiful woman .

We looked at each other. At that moment I felt there was nothing threatening about her. I smiled an d wav ed at her. She giggled as if she were a shy little girl an d covered her mouth. Somehow I felt delighted. I turned to don Juan to comment on her ap pearan ce an d behav ior, an d he scared me half to death with a yell. \"Don't turn your back to that woman , dam n it!\" he said in a forceful voice. I qu ickly turned to look at the woman . She had tak en an other couple of steps towards my car an d was stan ding barely five feet aw ay from my door. She was smiling; her teeth were big an d white an d very clean . There was something eerie ab out her smile, however. It was not friendly; it was a contained grin; only her mouth smiled. Her eyes were b lack an d cold an d were staring at me fixedly. I experienced a chill all over my body. Don Juan began to lau gh in a rhythmical cackle; after a moment's wait the woman slowly backed aw ay an d disap peared am ong people. We drove away an d don Juan speculated tha t if I did not tighten up my life an d learn, she was going to step on me as one steps on a defenseless bug. \"She is the worthy opponent I told you I had found for you, \" he said. Don Juan said that we had to wait for an omen before we knew what to do with the woman who was interfering with my hunting. \"If we see or hear a crow, we'll know for sure that we can wait, an d we'll also know where to wait, \" he ad ded. He slowly turned around in a complete circle, scan ning all the surroundings. \"This is not the pla ce to wait, \" he said in a whisper. We began to walk towards the east. It was alread y fairly dark. Suddenly two crows flew out from behind some tall bushes an d disap peared behind a hill. Don Juan said that the hill was our destination. Once we arrived ther e he circled it an d chose a place facing the southeast at the bottom of the hill. He clean ed the dry twigs and leav es an d other debris from a circular spot five or six feet in diam eter. I attempted to help him, but he refused me with a strong movement of h is han d. He put his finger over his lips an d mad e a gesture of silence. Wh en he had finished he pulled me to the center of the circle, mad e me face the south aw ay from the hill, an d whispered in my ear that I had to imitate his movements.

Once I had copied the rhythm, don Juan ceased to thump himself but had me continue, marking the pace with a movement of his han d. From time to time he would listen attentively, with his head slightly tilted to the right, seemingly to pick out noises in the chap arral. At one point he s ignaled me to stop an d he remained in a most alert position; it was as if he were read y to spring up an d jump on an unknown an d unseen assailan t. Then he motioned me to continue the thumping an d after a while he stopped me ag ain. Every time I stopped he l istened with such a concentration that every fiber in his body seemed to be tense to the point of bursting. Suddenly he jumped to my side an d whispered in my ear that the twilight was at its full power. I looked around. The chap arral was a dark mass, an d s o were the hills an d the rocks. The sky was dark blue an d I could not see the clouds an y more. The whole world seemed to be a uniform mass of dark silhouettes which did not hav e an y visible boundaries. I heard the eerie distan t cry of an an imal, a coyote o r perhap s a night bird. It hap pened so suddenly that I did not pay attention to it. But don Juan 's body jerked a bit. I felt its vibration as he stood next to me. \"Here we go, \" he whispered. \"Thump ag ain and be ready.

I shrieked an d fell down to the ground on my back. For a moment the dark silhouette was superimposed ag ainst the dark blue sky an d then it sailed through the air an d lan ded beyond us, in the bushes. I heard the sound of a heav y body crashing into the shrubs an d then an eerie outcry. Don Juan helped me up an d guided me in the darkness to the place where I had left my trap s. He made m e gather an d disassemble them an d then he scattered the pieces aw ay in all directions. He performed all this without say ing a single word. We did not speak at all on our way back to his house. \"Wh at do you wan t me to say ?\" don Juan asked after I had urged him repeatedly to explain the events I had witnessed a few hours before. \"Wh at was it? \"I asked. \"You know dam n well who it was, \" he said. \"Don't water it down with 'what was it?' It is who it was that is importan t.\" I had worked out an explan ation that s eemed to suit me. The figure I had seen looked very much like a kite that someone had let out over the hill while someone else, behind us, had pulled it to the ground, thus the effect of a dark silhouette sailing through the air perhap s fifteen or twenty y ards. He listened attentively to my explan ation an d then lau ghed until tears rolled down his cheeks. \"Quit beating around the bush, \" he said. \"Get to the point. Was n't it a woman ?\" I had to ad mit that when I fell down an d looked up I saw the dark silhouet te of a woman with a long skirt leap ing over me in a very slow motion; then something seemed to hav e pulled the dark silhouette an d it flew over me with great speed an d crashed into the bushes. In fact, that movement was what had given me the idea of a kit e. Don Juan refused to discuss the incident an y further. The next day he left to fulfill some mysterious erran d an d I went to visit some Yaqu i friends in an other community. We dnesday , December 12, 1962"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 173 As soon as I arrived at the Yaqu i community, the Mexi can storekeeper told me that he had rented a record play er an d twenty records from an outfit in Ciudad Obregon for the \"fiesta\" he was plan ning to give that night in honor of the Virgin of Guad alupe. He had alread y told everybody that he had mad e all the n ecessary arran gements through Julio, the trav eling salesman who cam e to the Yaqu i settlement twice a month to collect installments on a lay aw ay plan for cheap articles of clothing which he had succeeded in selling to some Yaqu i Indian s. Julio brought the r ecord play er early in the afternoon an d hooked it to the dynam o that provided electricity for the store. He made sure that it worked; then he turned up the volume to its max imum, reminded the storekeeper not to touch an y knobs, an d began to sort the twenty records. \"I know how man y scratches each of them has, \" Julio said to the storekeeper. \"Tell that to my dau ghter, \" the storekeeper replied. \"You're responsible, not your dau ghter.\" \"Just the sam e, she's the one who'll be chan ging the records.\" Julio insi sted that it did not mak e an y difference to him whether she or someone else was going to actually han dle the record player as long as the storekeeper paid for an y records that were dam ag ed. The storekeeper began to argue with Julio. Julio's face becam e red . He turned from time to time to the large group of Yaqu i Indian s congregated in front of the More an d mad e signs of despair or frustration by moving his han ds or contorting his face in a grimace. Seemingly as a final resort, he deman ded a cash deposit. Th at precipitated an other long argument ab out what constituted a dam ag ed record. Julio Mured with au thority that an y broken record had to be paid for in full, as if it were new. The storekeeper becam e an grier an d began to pull out his extension cords. He see med bent upon unhooking the record play er an d can celing the party. He made it clear to his clients congregated in front of the More that he had tried his best to come to terms with Julio. For a moment it seemed that the party was going to fail before it ha d started. lilas, the old Yaqu i Indian in whose house I was stay ing, mad e some derogatory comments in a loud voice ab out the Yiiqu is' sad state of affairs that they could not even celebrate their most revered religious festivity, the day of the Virgin of G uad alupe. I wan ted to intervene an d offer my help, but Bias stopped me. He said that if I were to mak e the cash deposit, the storekeeper himself would smash the records. \"He's worse than an ybody, \" he said. \"Let him pay the deposit. He bleeds us, so why sh ouldn't he pay ?\" After a long discussion in which, stran gely enough, everyone present was in fav or of Julio, the storekeeper hit upon terms which were mutually ag reeable. He did not pay a cash deposit but accepted responsibility for the records an d the rec ord play er. Julio's motorcycle left a trail of dust as he headed for some of the more remote houses in the locality. Bias said that he was trying to get to his customers before they cam e to the store an d spent all their money buying booze. As he was say ing this a group of Indian s"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 174 emerged from behind the store. Bias looked at them an d began to lau gh an d so did everyone else there. Bias told me that those Indian s were Julio's customers an d had been hiding behind the store waiting for him to leave. The party b egan early. The storekeeper's dau ghter put a record on the turntab le an d brought the arm down; there was a terrible loud screech an d a high - pitched buzz an d then cam e a blasting sound of a trumpet an d some guitars. The party consisted of play ing the record s at full volume. There were four young Mexican men who danced with the storekeeper's two dau ghters an d three other young Mexican women. The Yaqu is did not dan ce; they watched with ap parent delight every movement the dan cers mad e. They seemed to be enjoyin g themselves just watching an d gulping down cheap tequ ila. I bought individual drinks for everybody I knew. I wan ted to av oid an y feelings of resentment. I circulated am ong the numerous Indian s an d talked to them an d then offered them drinks. My pattern of behav ior worked until they realized I was not drinking at all. That seemed to an noy everyone at once. It was as if collectively they had discovered that I did not belong there. The Indian s becam e very gruff an d gav e me sly looks. The Mexican s, who were as drunk as the Indian s, also realized at the sam e time that I had not dan ced; an d that ap peared to offend them even more. They becam e very ag gressive. One of them forcibly took me by the arm an d drag ged me closer to the record play er; an other served me a fu ll cup of tequ ila an d wan ted me to drink it all in one gulp an d prove that I was a \"macho.\" I tried to stall them an d lau ghed idiotically as if I were actually enjoying the situation. I said that I would like to dan ce first an d then drink. One of the young men called out the nam e of a song. The girl in charge of the record player began to search in the pile of records. She seemed to be a little tipsy, although none of the women had openly been drinking, an d had trouble fitting a record on the turntab le. A y oung man said that the record she had selected was not a twist; she fumbled with the pile, trying to find the suitab le one, an d everybody closed in around her an d left me. That gav e me time to run behind the store, aw ay from the lighted area, an d out of si ght. I stood ab out thirty yards aw ay in the darkness of some bushes trying to decide what to do. I was tired. I felt it was time to get in my car an d go back home. I began to walk to Bias's house, where my car was parked. I figured that if I drove slowly n o one would notice that I was leav ing. The people in charge of the record play er were ap parently still looking for the record - all I could hear was the highpitched buzzi ng of the loudspeak er - but then cam e the blasting sound of a twist. I lau ghed out lou d, thinking that they had probab ly turned to where I had been an d found out that I had disap peared.

The blasting sound of the record player was almost as l oud there on the road as it was in front of the store.

I noticed then the dark shap e of a person, sitting or perhap s squ atting to my left, at the bend of the road . I thought for an instan t that it might hav e been one of the people from the party who had left before I had . The person seemed to be defecating on the side o f the road . That seemed odd. People in the community went into the thick bushes to perform their bodily functions. I thought that whoever it was in front of me must hav e been drunk. I cam e to the bend an d said, \"Buenas noches.\" The person an swered me with an eerie, gruff, inhuman howl. The hair on my body literally stood on end. For a second I was paralyzed. Then I began to walk fast. I took a qu ick glan ce. I saw that the dark silhouette had stood up halfway ; it was a woman . She was stooped over, lean ing f orward; she walked in that position for a few yards an d then she hopped. I began to run, while the woman hopped like a bird by my side, keeping up with my speed. By the time I arrived at Bias's house she was cutting in front of me an d we had almost touched . I leap ed across a small dry ditch in front of the house an d crashed through the flimsy door. Bias was alread y in the house an d seemed unconcerned with my story. \"They pulled a good one on you, \" he said reassuringly. \"The Indian s tak e delight in teasing foreigners.\" My experience had been so unnerving that the next day I drove to don Juan 's house instead of going home as I had plan ned to do. Don Juan returned in the late afternoon. I did not give him time to say an ything but blurted out the whole story, i ncluding Bias's commentary. Don Juan 's face becam e somber. Perhap s it was only my imagination, but I thought he was worried. \"Don't put so much stock in what Bias told you, \" he said in a serious tone. \"He knows nothing of the struggles between sorcerers. \"You should hav e known that it was something serious the moment you noticed that the shad ow was to your left. You shouldn't have run either.\" \"Wh at was I supposed to do? Stan d there?\" \"Right.

Besides, I didn't find you a worthy opponent becau se I wan t to play with you, or tease you, or an noy you.

Don Juan must hav e found my rendition funny; he lau ghed almost uncontrollab ly. Afterwards he ask ed me to reconstruct the total sequ ence; the distan ce I ran , the distan ce the woman was from me at the time I encountered her, the distan ce she was from me at the time I reached the house, an d the place where she had begun hopping. \"No fat Indian woman cou ld hop that way , \" he said after assessing all those variab les. \"They could not even run that far.\" He mad e me hop. I could not cover more than four feet each time, an d if I were correct in my perception, the woman had hopped at least ten feet with each le ap . \"Of course, you know that from now on you must be on the lookout, \" he said in a tone of great urgency. \"She will try to tap you on your left shoulder during a moment when you are unaw are an d weak .\" \"Wh at should I do? \"I asked. \"It is mean ingless to co mplain, \" he said. \"Wh at's importan t from this point on is the strategy of your life.\" I could not concentrate at all on what he was say ing. I took notes au tomatically. After a long silence he asked if I had an y pain behind my ears or in the nap e of my nec k. I said no, an d he told me that if I had experienced an uncomfortab le sensation in either of those two areas it would hav e mean t that I had been clumsy an d that \"la Catalina\" had injured me. \"Everything you did that night was clumsy, \" he said. \"First of all, you went to the party to kill time, as though there is an y time to kill. That weak ened you.\" \"You mean I shouldn't go to parties?\" \"No, I don't mean that. You may go an y place you wish, but if you do, you must assume the full responsibility for that act. A warrior lives his life strategically. He would attend a party or a reunion like that only if his strategy calls for it. That mean s, of course, that he would be in total control an d would perform all the acts that he deems necessary.\" He looked at m e fixedly an d smiled, then covered his face an d chuckled softly. \"You are in a terrible bind, \" he said. \"Your opponent is on your trail an d for the first time in your life you can not afford to act helter - skelter.

I had a moment of stran ge sobriety an d a series of thoughts occurred to me. On one level it was clear that what had tak en place between me an d \"la Catalina\" the first time I had confronted her was real. \"La Catalina\" was real, an d I could not discard the possibility that she was actually following me. On the other level I could not understan d how she was following me, an d this gav e rise to the faint suspicion that don Juan might be tricking me, an d that he h imself was somehow producing the weird effects I had witnessed. Don Juan suddenly looked at the sky an d told me that there was still time to go an d check the sorceress. He reassured me that we were running very little dan ger, becau se we were only going to drive by her house. \"You must confirm her shap e, \" don Juan said. \"Then there won't be an y doubts left in your mind, one way or the other.\""},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 178 My han ds began to sweat profusely an d I had to dry them repeatedly with a towel.

We went slowly am id a thick cloud of dust. The coarse grav el which was used to level the road had lumped with dirt during the rains, and chunks of dry mud rocks bounced ag ainst the metal underside of my car, mak ing loud explosive sounds. Don Juan told me to slow down as we were coming to a sm all bridge. There were four Indian s sitting there an d they wav ed at us. I was not sure whether or not I knew them. We passed the bridge an d the road curved gently. \"That's the woman 's house, \" don Juan whispered to me as he pointed with his eyes to a white house with a high bam boo fence all around it. He told me to mak e a U - turn an d stop in the middle of the road an d wait to see if the woman becam e suspicious enough to show her face. We stay ed there perhap s ten minutes.

I went to see him on that occasion in the sam e spirit I had gone to see him during the ten years of our association; that is t o say , I was once ag ain seeking the am enity of his compan y. His friend don Genaro, a Mazat ec Indian sorcerer, was with him. I had seen both of them during my previous visit six months earlier. I was considering whether or not to ask them if they had been t ogether all that time, when don Genaro explained that he liked the northern desert so much that he had returned just in time to see me. Both of them lau ghed as if they knew a secret. \"I cam e back just for you, \" don Genaro said. \"That's true, \" don Juan ec hoed. I reminded don Genaro that the last time I had been there, his attempts to help me to \"stop the world\" had been disastrous for me. That was my friendly way of letting him know that I was afraid of him. He lau ghed uncontrollab ly, shak ing his body an d kicking his legs like a child. Don Juan av oided looking at me an d also lau ghed. \"You're not going to try to help me an y more, are you, don Genaro?\" I asked. My qu estion threw both of them into spasms of lau ghter. Don Genaro rolled on the ground, lau ghing, then lay on his stomach an d began to swim on the floor. Wh en I saw him doing that I knew I was lost. At that moment my body somehow becam e aw are that I had arrived at the end. I did not know what that end was. My personal tendency to dram atizat ion an d my previous experience with don Genaro mad e me believe that it might be the end of my life. During my last visit to them, don Genaro had attempted to push me to the brink of \"stopping the world.\" His efforts had been so bizarre an d direct that don Juan himsel f had had to tell me to leave. Don Genaro's demonstrations of \"power\" were so extrao rdinary an d so baffling that they forced me to a total reevaluation of myself. I went home, reviewed the notes that I had tak en in the very beginning of my ap prenticeship, an d a whole new feeling mysteriously set in on me, although I had not been fully aw are of it until I saw don Genaro swimming on the floor. The act of swimming on the floor, which was congruous with other stran ge an d bewildering acts he had performed in fro nt of my very eyes, started as he was lying face down. He was first lau ghing so hard that his body shook as in a convulsion, then he began kicking, an d finally the movement of his legs becam e coordinated with a pad dling movement of his arms, an d don Genaro started to slide on the ground as if he were lying on a board fitted with ball bearings. He chan ged directions various times an d covered the entire area of the front of don Juan 's house, man euvering around me an d don Juan . Don Genaro had clowned in front of me before, an d every time he had done it don Juan had asserted that I had been on the brink of \"seeing.\" My failure to \"see\" was a result of my insistence on trying to explain every one of don Genaro's actions from a rational"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 180 point of view.

Wh en I looked at him ag ain he was stan ding by me with his head slightly tilted and his chin almost resting on my right shoulder. I had a delay ed startled reaction. I looked at him for a second an d then I jumped back. His expression of feigned surprise was so comical that I lau ghed hysterically. I could not help b eing aw are, however, that my lau ghter was unusual. My body shook with nervous spasms originating from the middle part of my stomach. Don Genaro put his han d on my stomach an d the convulsion - like ripples ceased. \"This little Carlos is alway s so exaggerated! \" he exclaimed as if he were a fastidious man . Then he ad ded, imitating don Juan 's voice an d man nerisms, \"Don't you know that a warrior never lau ghs that way ?\" His caricature of don Juan was so perfect that I lau ghed even harder. Then both of them left tog ether an d were gone for over two hours, until about midday . Wh en they returned they sat in the area in front of don Juan 's house. They did not say a word. They seemed to be sleepy, tired, almost ab sent - minded. They stay ed motionless for a long time, yet th ey seemed to be so comfortab le an d relax ed. Don Juan 's mouth was slightly opened, as if he were really asleep, but his han ds were clasped over his lap an d his thumbs moved rhythmically. I fretted an d chan ged sitting positions for a while, then I began to f eel a soothing placidity. I must hav e fallen asleep. Don Juan 's chuckle woke me up. I opened my eyes. Both of them were staring at me. \"If you don't talk, you fall asleep, \" don Juan said, lau ghing. \"I'm afraid I do, \" I said. Don Genaro lay on his back an d began to kick his legs in the air. I thought for a moment that he was going to start his disturbing clowning ag ain, but he went back right aw ay to his cross - legged sitting position. \"There is something you ought to be aware of by now, \" don Juan said. \"I call it the cubic centimeter of chan ce. All of us, whether or not we are warriors, hav e a cubic centimeter of chan ce that pops out in front of our eyes from time to time. The difference between an av erage man an d a warrior is that the warrior is aw are of this, an d one of his tasks is to be alert, deliberately waiting, so that when his cubic centimeter pops out he has the necessary speed, the prowess to pick it up. \"Chan ce, good luck, personal power, or whatever you may call it, is a peculiar state of affai rs.

Don Genaro nodded his head in ap proval. \"Yes, \" he said softly, 'as if talking to himself. \"Little Carlos is really tight, an d ab solutely alert.\" I felt that they were humoring me. I thought that perhap s my assertion about my alle ged condition of tightness may hav e an noyed them. \"I didn't mean to brag , \" I said. Don Genaro arched his eyebrows an d enlarged his nostrils. He glan ced at my notebook an d pretended to be writing. \"I think Carlos is tighter than ever, \" don Juan said to do n Genaro. \"May be he's too tight, \" don Genaro snap ped. \"He may very well be, \" don Juan conceded. I did not know what to interject at that point so I remained qu iet. \"Do you remember the time when I jam med your car?\" don Juan asked casually. His qu estion w as ab rupt an d unrelated to what we had been talking about. He was referring to a time when I could not start the engine of my car until he said I could. I remarked that no one could forget such an event. \"That was nothing, \" don Juan asserted in a factual tone. \"Nothing at all. True, Genaro?\" \"True, \" don Genaro said indifferently. \"Wh at do you mean ?\" I said in a tone of protest. \"Wh at you did that day was something truly beyond my comprehension.\" \"That's not say ing much, \" don Genaro retorted."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 182 They both la ughed loudly an d then don Juan patted me on the back. \"Genaro can do something much better than jam ming your car, \" he went on. \"True, Genaro?\" \"True, \" don Genaro replied, puckering up his lips like a child. \"Wh at can he do?\" I asked, trying to sound unru ffled. \"Genaro can tak e your whole car away !\" don Juan exclaimed in a booming voice; an d then he ad ded in the sam e tone, \"True, Genaro?\" \"True!\" don Genaro retorted in the loudest human tone I had ever heard. I jumped involuntarily. My body was convulsed b y three or four nervous spasms. \"Wh at do you mean , he can tak e my whole car aw ay ?\" I asked. \"Wh at did I mean , Genaro?\" don Juan asked. \"You mean t that I can get into his car, turn the motor on, an d drive away , \" don Genaro replied with unconvincing serious ness. \"Tak e the car away , Genaro, \" don Juan urged him in a joking tone. \"It's done!\" don Genaro said, frowning an d looking at me askew.

For an instan t I did not know what to do, but don Juan signaled me to stan d up. We began wal king up the small hill in front of don Juan 's house. Both of them flan ked me, don Juan to my right an d don Genaro to my left. They were perhap s six or seven feet ah ead of me, alway s within my full field of vision. \"Let's exam ine the car, \" don Genaro said ag ain. Don Juan moved his han ds as if he were spinning an invisible thread ; don Genaro did likewise an d repeated, \"Let's exam ine the car.\" They walked with a sort of bounce. Their steps were longer than usual, an d their han ds moved as though they were whi pping or batting some invisible objects in front of them. I had never seen don Juan clowning like that an d felt almost embarrassed to look at him. We reached the top an d I looked down to the area at the foot of the hill, some fifty yards away , where I had parked my car. My stomach contracted with a jolt. The car was not there! I ran down the hill. My car was not an ywhere in sight. I experienced a moment of great confusion. I was disoriented. My car had been parked there since I had arrived early in the morn ing. Perhap s half an hour before, I had come down to get a new pad of"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 183 writing pap er. At that time I had thought of leav ing the windows open becau se of the excessive heat, but the number of mosqu itoes an d other flying insects that ab ounded in the area had m ad e me chan ge my mind, an d I had left the car locked as usual. I looked all around ag ain. I refused to believe that my car was gone. I walked to the edge of the cleared area. Don Juan an d don Genaro joined me an d stood by me, doing exactly what I was doing , peering into the distan ce to see if the car was somewhere in sight. I had a moment of euphoria that gav e way to a disconcerting sense of an noyan ce. They seemed to hav e noticed it an d began to walk around me, moving their han ds as if they were rolling dou gh in them. \"Wh at do you think hap pened to the car, Genaro?\" don Juan asked in a meek tone. \"I drove it aw ay , \" don Genaro said an d mad e the most astounding motion of shifting gears an d steering. He bent his legs as though he were sitting, an d remained in that position for a few moments, obviously sustained only by the muscles of his legs; then he shifted his weight to his right leg an d stretched his left foot to mimic the action on the clutch. He made the sound of a motor with his lips; an d finally, to top everything, he pretended to hav e hit a bump in the road an d bobbed up an d down, giving me the complete sensation of an inept driver that bounces without letting go of the steering wheel. Don Genaro's pan tomime was stupendous. Don Juan lau ghed until he was out of breath. I wan ted to join them in their mirth but I was unab le to relax. I felt threatened an d ill at ease. An an xiety that had no precedence in my life possessed me. I felt I was burning up inside an d began kicking small rocks on the ground an d end ed up hurling them with an unconscious an d unpredictab le fury. It was as if the wrath was actually outside of myself an d had suddenly enveloped me. Then the feeling of an noyan ce left me, as mysteriously as it had hit me. I took a deep breath an d felt bette r. I did not dare to look at don Juan . My display of an ger embarrassed me, but at the sam e time I wan ted to lau gh. Don Juan cam e to my side an d patted me on the back. Don Genaro put his arm on my shoulder. \"It's all right!\" don Genaro said. \"Indulge yourse lf. Punch yourself in the nose an d bleed. Then you can get a rock an d knock your teeth out. It'll feel good! And if that doesn't help, \"| you can mash your balls with the sam e rock on that big boulder over there.\" Don Juan giggled. I told them that I was a sham ed of myself for hav ing behav ed so poorly. I did not know what had gotten into me. Don Juan said that he was sure I knew exactly what was going on, that I was pretending not to know, an d that it was the act of pretending that made me an gry. Don Genaro was unusually comforting; he patted my back repeatedly. \"It hap pens to all of us, \" don Juan said. \"Wh at do you mean by that, don Juan ?\" don Genaro asked, imitating my voice, mocking my habit of asking don Juan qu estions."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 184 Don Juan said some absurd things l ike \"Wh en the world is upside down we are right side up, but when the world is right side up we are upside down. Now when the world an d we are right side up, we think we are upside down. . . .\" He went on an d on, talking gibberish while don Genaro mimicked my tak ing notes. He wrote on an invisible pad, enlarging his nostrils as he moved his han d, keeping his eyes wide open an d fixed on don Juan . Don Genaro had cau ght on to my efforts to write without looking at my pad in order to av oid altering the natural flow of conversation. His portray al was genuinely hilarious. I suddenly felt very at ease, hap py. Their lau ghter was soothing. For a moment I let go an d had a belly lau gh. But then my mind entered into a new state of ap prehension, confusion, an d an noyan ce. I thought that whatever was tak ing place there was impossible; in fact, it was inconceivab le according to the logical order by which I am accustomed to judge the world at han d. Yet, as the perceiver, I perceived that my car was not there. The thought occu rred to me, as it alway s had hap pened when don Juan had confronted me with inexplicab le phenomena, that I was being tricked by ordinary mean s. My mind had alway s, under stress, involuntarily an d consistently repeated the sam e construct. I began to consider how man y confederates don Juan an d don Genaro would hav e needed in order to lift my car an d remove it from where I had parked it. I was absolutely sure that I had compulsively locked the doors; the han dbrak e was on; it was in gear; an d the steering wheel was locked. In order to move it they would hav e had to lift it up bodily. That task would hav e requ ired a labor force that I was convinced neither of them could hav e brought together. Another possibility was that someone in ag reement with them had broken i nto my car, wired it, an d driven it aw ay . To do that would hav e requ ired a specialized knowledge that was beyond their mean s. The only other possible explan ation was that perhap s they were mesmerizing me. Their movements were so novel to me an d so suspicio us that I entered into a spin of rationalizat ions. I thought that if they were hypnotizing me I was then in a state of altered consciousness. In my experience with don Juan I had noticed that in such states one is incap able of keeping a consistent mental r ecord of the passag e of time. There had never been an enduring order, in matters of passag e of time, in all the states of nonordinary reality I had experienced, an d my conclusion was that if I kept myself alert a moment would come when I would lose my orde r of sequ ential time. As if, for exam ple, I were looking at a mountain at a given moment, an d then in my next moment of aw areness I found myself looking at a valley in the opposite direction, but without remembering hav ing turned around. I felt that if som ething of that nature would hap pen to me I could then explain what was tak ing place with my car as, perhap s, a case of hypnosis. I decided that the only thing I could do was to watch every detail with excruciating thoroughness. \"Wh ere's my car?\" I asked, a ddressing both of them. \"Wh ere's the car, Genaro?\" don Juan asked with a look of utmost seriousness. Don Genaro began turning over small rocks and looking underneath them. He worked feverishly over the whole flat area where I had parked my car. He actually turned over every rock. At times he would pretend to get an gry an d I would hurl the rock into the bushes."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 185 Don Juan seemed to enjoy the scene beyond words. He giggled an d chuckled an d was almost oblivious to my presence. Don Genaro had just finished hurlin g a rock in a display of sham frustration when he cam e upon a good - sized boulder, the only large an d heav y rock in the parking area. He attempted to turn it over but it was too heav y an d too deeply imbedded in the ground. He struggled an d puffed until he w as perspiring. Then he sat on the rock an d called don Juan to help him. Don Juan turned to me with a beam ing smile an d said, \"Come on, let's give Genaro a han d.\" \"Wh at's he doing?\" I asked. \"He's looking for your car, \" don Juan said in a casual an d factua l tone. \"For heav en's sak e!

Don Juan suggested that we go to the house an d look for a th ick piece of wood to use as a lever. On our way to the house I told them that their acts were absurd an d that whatever they were doing to me was unnecessary. Don Genaro peered at me. \"Genaro is a very thorough man , \" don Juan said with a serious expression . He's as thorough an d meticulous as you are. You yourself said that you never leav e a stone unturned.

After a long search around the house for a thick piece of wood, don Genaro found a long an d fairly thick tree trunk, a part of a house beam . He put it across his shoulders an d we started back to the place where my car had been. As we were going up the small hill an d were ab out to reach a bend in the trail from where I would see the flat parking area, I had a sudden insight. It occurred to me t hat I was going to find my car before they did, but when I looked down, there was no car at the foot of the hill. Don Juan an d don Genaro must hav e understood what I had had in mind an d ran after me, lau ghing uproariously. Once we got to the bottom of the hill they immediately went to work. I watched them for a few moments. Their acts were incomprehensible. They were not pretending that they were working, they were actually immersed in the task of turning over a boulder to see if my car was underneath. That was too much for me an d I joined them.

Mean while I kept a most meticulous mental record of everything I touched or saw. My sequ ential an d orderly view of the world around me was as continuous as it had alway s been. I touched rocks, bushes, trees. I shifted my view from the foreground to the background by looking out of one eye an d then out of the other. By all calculations I was walking in the chap arral as I had done scores of times during my ordinary life. Next don Genaro lay down on his stomach an d asked us to do likewise. He rested his chi n on his clasped han ds. Don Juan did the sam e. Both of them stared at a series of small protuberan ces on the ground that looked like minute hills.

My statement was congruous with what I had perceived an d was not intended as a joke, but they took it as perhap s the most hilarious statement that an yone had mad e that day .

Don Genaro took off his hat an d rearran ged the strap with a piece of string from his pouch, then he attached his woolen belt to a yellow tassel affixed to the brim of the hat. \"I'm mak ing a kite out of my hat, \" he said to me. I watched h im an d I knew that he was joking. I had always considered myself to be an expert on kites. Wh en I was a child I used to mak e the most complex kites an d I knew that the brim of the straw hat was too brittle to resist the wind.

Don Genaro was unconcerned an d finished attaching a long str ing to his kite - hat. It was a windy day an d don Genaro ran downhill as don Juan held his hat, then don Genaro pulled the string an d the dam n thing actually flew. \"Look, look at the kite!\" don Genaro yelled. It bobbed a couple of times but it remained in th e air. \"Don't tak e your eyes off of the kite, \" don Juan said firmly. For a moment I felt dizzy .

It was sitting on a rocky flat area ab out a hundred feet aw ay. It actually looked as if someone had just placed it there.

Wh en we arrived at the house I automatically jumped out of the car an d opened the door for them.

He was cutting firewood in the back of his house, but don Genaro was no where in sight. He said that there was nothing to talk ab out. I pointed out that I had succeeded in remaining aloof an d had observed don Genaro's \"swimming on the floor\" without wan ting or deman ding an y explan ation whatsoever, but my restraint had not help ed me to understan d what was tak ing place.

My thoughts began to diminish by degrees until I was no longer talking to myself. I then had a sensation of an noyan ce.

At first I paid no attention to it but then I realized that that flicker had been to my left. I turned ag ain sudden ly an d was ab le to clearly perceive a shad ow on the rock. I had the weird sensation that the shad ow instan tly slid down to the ground an d the soil absorbed it as a blotter dries an ink blotch. A chill ran down my back. The thought crossed my mind that deat h was watching me an d the beetle. I looked for the insect ag ain but I could not find it. I thought that it must hav e arrived at its destination an d then had dropped its load into a hole in the ground. I put my face ag ainst a smooth rock. The beetle emerged from a deep hole an d stopped a few inches aw ay from my face. It seemed to look at me an d for a moment I felt that it becam e aware of my presence, perhap s as I was aw are of the presence of my death. I experienced a shiver. The beetle an d I were not that di fferent after all. Death, like a shad ow, was stalking both of us from behind the boulder. I had an extrao rdinary moment of elation. The beetle and I were on a par. Neither of us was better than the other. Our death mad e us equ al. My elation an d joy were so overwhelming that I began to weep. Don Juan was right. He had alway s been right. I was living in a most mysterious world an d, like everyone else, I was a most mysterious being, an d yet I was no more importan t than a beetle. I wiped my eyes an d as I rubbed them with the back of my han d I saw a man , or something which had the shap e of a man . It was to my right ab out fifty yards away . I sat up straight an d strained to see. The sun was almost on the horizo n an d its yellowish glow prevented me from getting a cl ear view. I heard a peculiar roar at that"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 moment. It was like the sound of a distan t jet plan e. As I focused my attention on it, the roar increased to a prolonged sharp metallic whizzi ng an d then it softened until it was a mesmerizing, melodious sound. The melody was like the vibration of an electrical current. The imag e that cam e to my mind was that two electrified spheres were coming together, or two squ are blocks of electrified metal were rubbing ag ainst each other an d then coming to rest with a thump wh en they were perfectly leveled with each other. I ag ain strained to see if I could distinguish the person that seemed to be hiding from me, but I could only detect a dark shap e against the bushes. I shielded my eyes by placing my han ds above them. The bril lian cy of the sunlight chan ged at that moment an d then I realized that what I was seeing was only an optical illusion, a play of shad ows an d foliag e. I moved my eyes away an d I saw a coyote calmly trotting across the field. The coyote was around the spot w here I thought I had seen the man . It moved about fifty yards in a southerly direction an d then it stopped, turned, an d began walking towards me. I yelled a couple of times to scare it away , but it kept on coming. I had a moment of ap prehension. I thought that it might be rab id an d I even considered gathering some rocks to defend myself in case of an attack. Wh en the an imal was ten to fifteen feet aw ay I noticed that it was, not ag itated in an y way ; on the contrary, it seemed calm an d unafraid. It slowed do wn its gait, coming to a halt barely four or five feet from me. We looked at each other, an d then the coyote cam e even closer. Its brown eyes were friendly an d clear. I sat down on the rocks an d the coyote stood almost touching me. I was dumbfounded. I had never seen a wild coyote that close, an d the only thing that occurred to me at that moment was to talk to it. I began as one would talk to a friendly dog. And then I thought that the coyote \"talked\" back to me. I had the absolute certainty that it had sai d something. I felt confused but I did not hav e time to ponder upon my feelings, becau se the coyote \"talked\" ag ain. It was not that the an imal was voicing words the way I am accustomed to hearing words being voiced by human beings, it was rather a \"feeling \" that it was talking. But it was not like a feeling that one has when a pet seems to communicate with its master either. The coyote actually said something; it relayed a thought an d that communication cam e out in something qu ite similar to a sentence. I had said, \"How are you, little coyote?\" an d I thought I had heard the an imal respond, \"I'm all right, an d you?\" Then the coyote repeated the sentence an d I jumped to my feet. The an imal did not mak e a single movement. It was not even startled by my sudde n jump. Its eyes were still friendly an d clear. It lay down on its stomach an d tilted its head an d asked, \"Wh y are you afraid?\" I sat down facing it an d I carried on the weirdest conversation I had ever had . Finally it asked me what I was doing there an d I said I had come there to \"stop the world.\" The coyote said, \"Que bueno!\" an d then I realized that it was a bilingual coyote. The nouns an d verbs of its sentences were in English, but the conjunctions an d exclam ations were in Span ish. The thought crossed m y mind that I was in the presence of a Chican o coyote. I began to lau gh at the absurdity of it all an d I lau ghed so hard that I becam e almost hysterical. Then the full weight of the impossibility of what was hap pening struck me an d my mind wobbled. The coy ote stood up an d our eyes met. I stared fixedly into them. I felt they were pulling me an d suddenly the an imal becam e iridescent; it began to glow. It was as if my mind were replay ing the memory of an other event that had tak en place ten years before, when under the influence of peyote I witnessed the metam orphosis of an ordinary dog into an unforgettab le iridescent being. It was as though the coyote had triggered the recollection, an d the memory of that previous event was summoned an d becam e superimposed on the coyote's shap e; the coyote was a"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 fluid, liqu id, luminous being. Its luminosity was dazzl ing. I wan ted to cover my eyes with my han ds to protect them, but I could not move. The luminous being touched me in some undefined part of myself an d my body expe rienced such an exqu isite indescribab le warmth an d well - being that it was as if the touch had mad e me explode. I becam e tran sfixed. I could not feel my feet, or my legs, or an y part of my body, yet something was sustaining me erect. I hav e no idea how long I stay ed in that position. In the mean time, the luminous coyote an d the hilltop where I stood melted away . I had no thoughts or feelings. Everything had been turned off an d I was floating freely. Suddenly I felt that my body had been struck an d then it be cam e enveloped by something that kindled me. I becam e aw are then that the sun was shining on me. I could vag uely distinguish a distan t ran ge of mountains towards the west. The sun was almost over the horizo n. I was looking directly into it an d then I saw t he \"lines of the world.\" I actually perceived the most extrao rdinary profusion of fluorescent white lines which crisscrossed everything around me. For a moment I thought that I was perhap s experiencing sunlight as it was being refracted by my eyelashes. I blinked an d looked ag ain. The lines were constan t an d were superimposed on or were coming through everything in the surroundings. I turned around an d exam ined an extrao rdinarily new world. The lines were visible an d stead y even if I looked away from the su n. I stay ed on the hilltop in a state of ecstasy for what ap peared to be an endless time, yet the whole event may hav e lasted only a few minutes, perhap s only as long as the sun shone before it reached the horizo n, but to me it seemed an endless time. I fe lt something warm an d soothing oozing out of the world and out of my own body. I knew I had discovered a secret. It was so simple. I experienced an unknown flood of feelings. Never in my life had I had such a divine euphoria, such peace, such an encompass ing grasp, an d yet I could not put the discovered secret into words, or even into thoughts, but my body knew it. Then I either fell asleep or I fainted. Wh en I ag ain becam e aw are of myself I was lying on the rocks. I stood up. The world was as I had alway s seen it. It was getting dark an d I au tomatically started on my way back to my car. Don Juan was alone in the house when I arrived the next morning. I asked him ab out don Genaro an d he said that he was somewhere in the vicinity, running an erran d. I immedi ately began to narrate to him the extrao rdinary experiences I had had . He listened with obvious interest. \"You hav e simply stopped the world, \" he commented after I had finished my account. We remained silent for a moment an d then don Juan said that I had to than k don Genaro for helping me. He seemed to be unusually pleased with me. He patted my back repeatedly an d chuckled. \"But it is inconceivab le that a coyote could talk, \" I said. \"It wasn't talk, \" don Juan replied. \"Wh at was it then?\" \"Your body under stood for the first time.

There was something so sad ab out their look. \"In my I find only phan tom trav elers,\" he said softly. I looked at don Juan . I had not understood what don Genaro had mean t. \"Everyone Genaro finds on his way to Ixtlan is only an ephemeral being, \" don Juan explained. \"Take you, for instan ce. You are a phan tom.

Could I rescue them an d tak e them with me?\" \"No. Your ally will spin you, alone, into unknown worlds.\" \"But I could go back to Los Angeles, couldn't I?
