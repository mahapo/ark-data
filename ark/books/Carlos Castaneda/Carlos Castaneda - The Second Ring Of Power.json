Carlos Castaneda’s extraordinary journey into the world of sorcery has captivated millions of Americans. In his eagerly awaited new book, he takes the reader into a sorceric expe rience so intense , so terrifying, and so profoun dly disturbing that it can onl y be described as a brilliant assault on the reason, the dramatic and fright ening attack on every preconc eived not ion of life that is don Juan’s remarkable legacy to his appr entice."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 At the center of the book is a new and formidable figur e, dona Soledad, a wom an whos e pow ers are turned against Castaneda in a struggl e that almost cons um es him. Dona Soledad has been taught by don Juan, transformed by his teachings from a bent and grayha ired old wom an into a sensual, lithe, deeply sexua l figur e of awesom e and mysterious pow er, a sorceress whos e mission is to test Castaneda by a series of terrifying tricks. In dona Soledad, Carlos Castaneda has recorded for the reader a persona lity as instantly recogni z able as don Juan himself and has illum inated the strengt hs and the feelings of a remarkable wom an who, despite her sorceric gifts, expr esses some of the deepest and most basic feminine conc erns and ambitions . For dona Soledad, drawn out of the shadow s of a defeated and meaningl ess life by don Juan, has herself becom e a warrior, a hunt er and “a stalker of pow er.” Castaneda’s com bat with her, his gradua l realization that she not onl y derives her pow er from don Juan but is fulfilling his plans, is all a prelud e to an astoni shing discove ry. For Castaneda unf olds for the reader a sorcerer’s family, in which dona Soledad, her “girls,” Lidia, Elena (“la Gorda”), Josefina and Rosa, themselves change d and transformed by don Juan, are part of a small closed society in which the teachings of don Juan have becom e a way of life, touc hing and expl aining every aspect of the world, altering the relations hips between them so that they are no longe r mother and children, man and wife, sisters and brothers, friends and enemies, but disciples, witnesses, accom plices in don Juan’s grand design.

The solemnity and the scope of what took place there left no doubt in my mind that our appr ent iceships had com e to their conc ludi ng mom ent, and that I was inde ed seeing don Juan and don Genaro for the last time. Tow ard the end we all said goodbye to one anot her, and then Pablito and I jum ped toge ther from the top of the mount ain into an abys s. Pri or to that jum p don Juan had presented a funda mental principle for all that was goi ng to happe n to me. According to him, upon jum ping into the abys s I was goi ng to becom e pur e perception and move back and forth between the two inhe rent realms of all creati on, the tona l and the nagua l. In my jum p my perception went through seventeen elastic bounc es between the tona l and the nagua l. In my move s into the nagua l I perceived my body disintegrating. I coul d not think or feel in the cohe rent, uni fying sense that I ordinarily do, but I som ehow though t and felt. In my move s into the tona l I bur st into uni ty. I was whol e. My perception had cohe rence. I had visions of order. Their com pelling force was so intense, their vividness so real and their com plexity so vast tha t I have not been capable of expl aining them to my satisfaction. To say that they were visions , vivid dreams or even hallucinations doe s not say anyt hing to clarify their nature."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 After having examined and analyzed in a most thor ough and careful manne r my f eelings , perceptions and interpretations of that jum p into the abys s, I had com e to the poi nt where I coul d not rationally believe that it had actually happe ned. And yet anot her part of me held on steadfast to the feeling that it did happe n, that I did jum p. Don Juan and don Genaro are no longe r available and their absence has created in me a most pressing need, the need to make headw ay in the midst of appa rently insolub le cont radictions . I went back to Mexico to see Pablito and Nestor to seek their help in resolving my conf licts. But what I encount ered on my trip cannot be described in any other way except as a final assault on my reason, a conc entrated attack designe d by don Juan himself. His appr entices, unde r his absentee direction, in a most methodi cal and precise fashion demolished in a few days the last bastion of my reason. In thos e few days they revealed to me one of the two practical aspects of their sorcery, the art of dreaming, which is the core of the present work. The art of stalking, the other practical aspect of their sorcery and also the crow ning stone of don Juan’s and don Genaro’s teachings , was presented to me dur ing subs eque nt visits and was by far the most com plex facet of their being in the world as sorcerers. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 1 The Tran sformation of Don a Soledad I had a sudde n premoni tion that Pablito and Nestor were not hom e. My certainty was so profound that I stoppe d my car. I was at the place where the aspha lt came to an abrupt end, and I wanted to recons ider whether or not to cont inue that day the long and difficult drive on the steep, coarse gravel road to their hom etown in the mount ains of central Mexico. I rolled dow n the windo w of my car. It was rather windy and cold. I got out to stretch my legs. The tension of driving for hour s had stiffe ned my back and neck. I walked to the edge of the paved road. The ground was wet from an early show er. Rain was still falling heavily on the slope s of the mount ains to the sout h, a shor t distance from where I was. But right in front of me, tow ard the east and also tow ard the nor th, the sky was clear. At certain poi nts on the windi ng road I had been able to see the bluish peaks of the sierras shining in the sunl ight a great distance away. After a mom ent’s deliberation I decided to turn back and go to the ci ty because I had had a most peculiar feeling that I was goi ng to find don Juan in the market. After all, I had always done just that, found him in the marketplace, since the beginni ng of my association with him. As a rule, if I did not find him in Sonor a I woul d drive to central Mexico and go to the market of that particular city, and soone r or later don Juan woul d show up. The longe st I had ever waited for him was"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 two days. I was so habituated to meeting him in that manne r that I had the most absolute cert ainty that I woul d find him again, as always. I waited in the market all afterno on. I walked up and dow n the aisles pretendi ng to be looki ng for som ething to buy. Then I waited around the park. At dus k I kne w that he was not com ing. I had then the clear se nsation that he had been there but had left. I sat dow n on a park bench where I used to sit with him and tried to analyze my feelings . Upon arriving in the city I was elated with the sure know ledge that don Juan was there in the streets. What I felt was mo re than the memory of having foun d him there count less times before; my body kne w that he was looki ng for me. But then, as I sat on the bench I had anot her kind of strange certainty. I kne w that he was not there anym ore. He had left and I had missed him. A fter a while I discarded my speculations . I thought that I was beginni ng to be affected by the place. I was starting to get irrationa l; that had always happe ned to me in the past after a few days in that area. I went to my hot el room to rest for a few hour s and then I went out again to roam the streets. I did not have the same expe ctation of finding don Juan that I had had in the afternoon. I gave up. I went back to my hot el in order to get a good night ’s sleep. Before I headed for the moun tains in the morn ing, I drove up and dow n the main streets in my car, but som ehow I kne w that I was wasting my time. Don Juan was not there. It took me all morning to drive to the little tow n where Pablito and Nestor lived. I arrived around no on. Don Juan had taught me nev er to drive directly into the tow n so as not to arous e the curiosity of onl ooke rs. Every time I had been there I had always driven off the road, just before reaching the tow n, ont o a flat field"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 where youngs ters usually played soccer. The dirt was well pack ed all the way to a walking trail which was wide enough for a car and which passed by Pablito’s and Nestor’s hous es in the foot hills sout h of town. As soon as I got to the edge of the field I foun d that the walking trail had been turned into a gravel road . I deliberated whether to go to Nestor’s hou se or Pablito’s. The feeling that they were not there still persisted. I opt ed to go to Pablito’s; I reasone d that Nestor lived alone , while Pablito lived with his mother and his four sisters. If he was not the re the wom en coul d help me find him. As I got closer to his hous e I not iced that the path leading from the road up to the hous e had been widened. It looke d as if the ground was hard, and since there was enough space for my car, I drove almost to the front doo r. A new por ch with a tile roof had been adde d to the adobe hous e. There were no dogs barking but I saw an enor mous one sitting calmly behind a fenced area, alertly obs erving me. A flock of chickens that had been feeding in front of the hous e scattered around, cackling. I turned the motor off and stretched my arms ove r my head. My body was stiff. The hous e seemed deserted. The thought crossed my mind that perhaps Pablito and his family had move d away and som eone else was living there. Sudde nly the front doo r ope ned with a bang and Pablito’s mother steppe d out as if som eone had pus hed her. She stared at me absentminde dly for an instant. As I got out of my car she seemed to recogni ze me. A graceful shiver ran through her body and she ran tow ard me. I thou ght that she must have been nappi ng and that the noi se of the car had woke n her, and when she came out to see what was goi ng on she did not know at first who I was. The incongr uous sight of the old wom an runni ng toward me made me smile. When she got closer I had a mom ent of doubt . Som ehow she move d so nimbly that she did not seem like Pablito’s mother at all. “My goodne ss what a surprise!” she exclaimed."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 “Dona Soledad?” I asked, incredul ous ly. “Don’ t you recogn ize me?” she replied, laughi ng. I made som e stu pid com ments about her surprising agility. “Why do you always see me as a helpless old wom an?” she asked, looki ng at me with an air of mock challenge . She blunt ly accused me of having nickna med her “Mrs. Pyramid.” I remembered that I had onc e said to Nest or that her shape reminde d me of a pyr amid. She had a very broad and massive behind and a small poi nted head. The long dresses that she usually wore adde d to the effect. “Look at me,” she said. “Do I still look like a pyr amid?” She was smiling but her eyes made me feel unc om fortable. I attempted to defend myself by making a joke but she cut me off and coaxed me to adm it that I was respons ible for the nickna me. I assured her that I had never intende d it as such and that anyw ay, at that mom ent she was so lea n that her shape was the furthest thing from a pyr amid. “What’s happe ned to you, dona Soledad?” I asked. “You’ re transformed.” “You said it,” she replied briskly. “I’ve been transformed! “ I meant it figur atively. How ever, upon closer examination I had to adm it that there was no room for a metaphor . She was truly a change d person. I sudde nly had a dry, metallic taste in my mout h. I was afraid. She placed her fists on her hips and stood with her legs slight ly apart, facing me. She was wearing a light green, gathered skirt and a whitish blous e. Her skirt was shor ter than thos e she used to wear. I coul d not see her hair; she had it tied with a thick band, a turbanlike piece of cloth. She was barefoot and she rhyt hm ically tappe d her big feet on the ground as she smiled with the candor of a young girl. I had never seen anyone exude as much strengt h as she did. I not iced a"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 strange gleam in her eyes, a disturbing gleam but not a fright ening one . I thought that perhaps I had never really examined her appe arance caref ully. Among other things I felt gui lty for having glossed ove r many peopl e dur ing my years with don Juan. The force of his persona lity had rend ered everyone else pale and uni mpo rtant. I told her that I had never imagined that she coul d have such a stupe ndo us vitality, that my carelessness was to blame for not really kn ow ing her, and that no doubt I woul d have to meet everyone else all ove r again. She came closer to me. She smiled and put her right hand on the back of my left arm, grabbi ng it gently. “That’s for sure,” she whispered in my ear. Her smile froze and her eyes became glazed. She was so close to me that I felt her breasts rubbi ng my left shoul der. My discom fort increased as I tried to convi nce myself that there was no reason for alarm. I repeated to myself ove r and ove r that I really had never know n Pablito’s mother, and that in spite of her odd behavior she was proba bly being her nor mal self. But som e fright ened part of me kne w that thos e were onl y bracing though ts with no subs tance at all, becaus e no matter how much I may have glossed ove r her person, not onl y did I remember her very well but I had know n her very well. She represented to me the archetype of a mother; I thought her to be in her late fifties or even older. Her weak muscles move d her bul ky weight with extreme difficulty. Her hair had a lot of gray in it. She was, as I remembered her, a sad, som ber wom an with kind, hands om e features, a dedicated, suffering mother, always in the kitchen, always tired. I also remembered her to be a very gentle and uns elfish wom an, and a very timid one , timid to the poi nt of being tho rough ly subs ervient to anyone who happe ned to be around. That was the picture I had of her, reinforced throughout years of casual cont act. That"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 day som ething was terribly diff erent. The wom an I was conf ront ing did not at all fit the image I had of Pablito’s mother, and yet she was the same person, leaner and stronge r, looki ng twenty years younge r, than the last time I had seen her. I felt a shiver in my body. She move d a coupl e of steps in front of me and faced me. “Let me look at you, ” she said. “The Nagua l told us that you’ re a devil.” I remembered then that all of them, Pablito, his mother, his sisters and Nestor, had always seemed unw illing to voi ce don Juan’s name and calle d him “the Nagua l,” a usage which I myself adopt ed when talking with them. She daringl y pu t her hands on my shoul ders, som ething she had never done before. My body tensed. I really did not know what to say. There was a long pause that allow ed me to take st ock of myself. Her appe arance and behavior had frigh tened me to the poi nt that I had forgotten to ask about Pablito and Nestor. “Tell me, where is Pablito?” I asked her with a sudde n wave of appr ehension. “Oh, he’s gone to the mount ains,” she responde d in a nonc om mittal tone and move d away from me. “And where is Nestor?” She rolled her eyes as if to show her indi fference. “They are toge ther in the moun tains,” she said in the same tone . I felt genui nely relieved and told her that I had know n without the shad ow of a doubt that they were all right . She glanced at me and smiled. A wave of happi ness and ebul lience came upon me and I embraced her. She bol dly returned the embrace and held me; that act was so out landi sh that it took my breath away. Her body was rigi d. I sensed an extraordinary strengt h in her. My heart began to pound. I gently tried to pus h her away as I asked her if Nestor was still seeing don Genaro and don Juan. During our"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 farewell meeting don Juan had expr essed doubt s that Nestor was ready to fin ish his appr enticeship. “Genaro has left forever,” she said letting go of me. She fretted nervous ly with the edge of her blous e. “How about don Juan?” “The Nagua l is gone too, ” she said, puc kering her lips. “Where did they go? ” “You mean you don’ t know ?” I told her that bot h of them had said goodb ye to me two years before, and that all I kne w was that they were leaving at that time. I had not really dared to speculate where they had gone . They had never told me their whereabou ts in the past, and I had com e to accept the fact that if they wanted to disappe ar from my life all they had to do was to refuse to see me. “They’re not around, that’s for sure,” she said, frow ning, “And they won’ t be com ing back, that’s also for sure.” Her voi ce was extremely une motion al. I began to feel annoye d with her. I wanted to leave. “But you’ re here,” she said, changi ng her frow n into a smile. “You must wait for Pablito and Nestor. They’ve been dyi ng to see you. ” She held my arm firmly and pul led me away from my car. Com pared t o the way she had been in the past, her bol dne ss was astoundi ng. “But first, let me show you my friend, ” she said and forcibly led me to the side of the hous e. There was a fenced area, like a small corral. A huge male dog was there. The first thing that at tracted my attention was his healthy, lustrous , yellow ishbr ow n fur. He did not seem to be a mean dog. He was not chained and the fence was not high enough to hol d him.

A coyot e was curled up inside. “That’s my friend, ” she said. “The dog is not. He belongs to my girls.” The dog looke d at me and yawned. I liked him. I had a nons ensical feeling of kinship with him. “Com e, let’s go into the hous e,” she said, pulling me by the arm. I hesitated. Som e part of me was utterly alarmed and wanted to get out of there qui ckly, and yet anot her part of me woul d not have left for the world. “You’ re not afraid of me, are you? ” she asked in an accusing tone . “I most certainly am!” I exclaimed. She giggl ed, and in a most com forting tone she declared that she was a clum sy, primitive wom an who was very awkw ard with words, and that she hardly kne w how to treat peopl e. She looke d straight into my eye s and said that don Juan had com missione d her to help me, because he worried about me. “He told us that you’ re not serious and go around causing a lot of troub le to innoc ent peopl e,” she said. Up to that poi nt her assertions had been cohe rent to me, but I coul d not conc eive don Juan saying thos e things abou t me. We went inside the hous e. I wanted to sit dow n on the bench, where Pablito and I usually sat. She stoppe d me. “This is not the place for you and me,” she said. “Let’s go to my room .” “I’d rather sit here,” I said firmly. “I know this spot and I feel com fortable on it.” She clicked her lips in disappr ova l. She acted like a disappoi nted child. She cont racted her uppe r lip un til it looke d like the flat beak of a duc k.

I conf ront ed her with her un mistakable transformation and demande d that she tell me what had happe ned. I had to know how such a change had com e about . “If I tell you, will you stay?” she asked in a child’s voi ce. “I’ll have to.” “In that case I’ll tell you everything. But it has to be in my room .” I had a mom ent of panic. I made a supr em e effort to calm myself and we walked into her room . She lived in the back, where Pablito had bui lt a bedroom for her. I had onc e been in the room while it was being bui lt and also after it was finished, just before she move d in. The roo m looke d as empty a s I had seen it before, except that there was a bed in the very center of it and two unobt rusive chests of drawers by the door . The whitewash of the walls had faded into a very soot hing yellow ish white. The wood of the ceiling had also weathered. Looki ng at the smoot h, clean walls I had the impression they were scrubbe d daily with a sponge . The room looke d more like a mona stic cell, very fruga l and ascetic. There were no ornaments of any sort. The windo ws had thick, remova ble wood panels reinforced with a n iron bar. There were no chairs or anyt hing to sit on. Dona Soledad took my writing pad away from me, held it to her bos om and then sat dow n on her bed, which was made up of two thick mattresses with no box springs . She indi cated that I shoul d sit dow n ne xt to her. “You and I are the same,” she said as she hande d me my not ebook. “I beg your pardon? ” “You and I are the same,” she repeated without looki ng at me. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 I coul d not figu re out what she meant. She stared at me, as if waiting for a respons e. “Just wha t is that suppos ed to mean, dona Soledad?” I asked. My que stion seemed to baffle her. Obvi ous ly she expe cted me to know what she meant. She laughe d at first, but then, when I insisted that I did not unde rstand, she got angr y. She sat up straight and accuse d me of being dishone st with her. Her eyes flared with rage; her mout h cont racted in a very ugl y gesture of wrath that made her look extremely old. I hone stly was at a loss and felt that no matter what I said it woul d be wrong. She also seemed to be in th e same predicament. Her mout h move d to say som ething but her lips onl y qui vered. At last she muttered that it was not impeccable to act the way I did at such a serious mom ent. She turned her back to me. “Look at me, dona Soledad!” I said forcefully. “I’m n ot mystifying you in any sense. You must know som ething that I know not hing about .” “You talk too much,” she snappe d angr ily. “The Nagua l told me never to let you talk. You twist everything. ” She jum ped to her feet and stom ped on the floor , like a spoi led child. I became aware at that mom ent that the room had a different floo r. I remembered it to be a dirt floor , made from the dark soil of the area. The new floor was reddi sh pink. I mom entarily pu t off a conf ront ation with her and walked around the room . I coul d not imagine how I coul d have missed not icing the floo r when I first entered. It was magni ficent. At first I thoug ht that it was red clay that had been laid like cement, when it was soft and moist, but then I saw that there were no cracks in it. Clay woul d have dried, curled up, cracked, and clum ps woul d have formed. I bent dow n and gently ran my finge rs ove r it. It was as hard as bricks. The clay had been fired. I became aware then that the floor was made of very large flat slabs of"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 clay put toge ther ove r a bed of soft clay that served as a matrix. The slabs made a most intricate and fascinating design, but a thor oug hly unobt rusive one , unl ess one paid deliberate attention to it. The skill with which the slabs had been placed in pos ition indi cated to me a very wellconc eived plan. I wanted to know how such big slabs had been fired without being warped. I turned aroun d to ask dona Soledad. I qui ckly desisted. She woul d not have know n what I was talking about . I paced ove r the floor again. The clay was a bit rough, almost like sands tone . It made a perfect slideproo f surface. “Did Pablito put dow n this floor ?” I asked. She did not answer. “It’s a supe rb piece of work,” I said. “You shoul d be very proud of him.” I had no doubt that Pablito had done it. No on e else coul d have had the imagination and the capacity to conc eive of it. I figur ed that he must have made it dur ing the time I had been away. But on second thought I realized that I had never entered dona Soledad’s roo m since it had been bui lt, six or sev en years before. “Pablito! Pablito! Bah!” she exclaimed in an angr y, raspy voi ce. “What makes you think he’s the onl y one who can make things ?” We exchange d a long, sustained look, and all of a sudde n I kne w that it was she who had made the floor , and that don Juan had put her up to it. We stood qui etly, looki ng at each other for som e time. I felt it woul d have been thor oughl y supe rfluous to ask if I was correct. “I made it myself,” she finally said in a dry tone . “The Nagua l told me how .” Her statements ma de me feel euphor ic. I practically lifted her up in an embrace. I twirled her around. All I coul d think to do was to bom bard her with que stions . I wanted to know how she had made the slabs, what the designs represented, where she got the clay. But she did not share my exhi laration. She remained qui et and impassive, looki ng at me askance from time to time."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 I paced on the floor again. The bed had been placed at the very epicenter of som e conve rging lines. The clay slabs had been cut in sharp angl es to create conve rging motifs that seemed to radiate out from unde r the bed. “I have no words to tell you how impressed I am,” I said. “Words! Who needs words?” she said cuttingl y. I had a flash of insight . My reason had been betraying me. There was onl y one pos sibl e way of expl aining her magni ficent metamorph osis; don Juan must have made her his appr entice. How else coul d an old wom an like dona Soledad turn into such a weird, pow erful being? That shoul d have been obvi ous to me from the mom ent I laid eyes on her, but my set of expe ctations about her had not include d that pos sibility. I deduc ed that whatever don Juan had done to her must have taken place dur ing the two years I had not seen her, although two years seemed hardly any time at all for such a supe rb alterati on. “I think I know now what happe ned to you, ” I said in a casual and cheerful tone . “Som ething has cleared up in my mind right now .” “Oh, is that so?” she said, thor oughl y uni nterested. “The Nagua l is teaching you to be a sorceress, isn’t that true?” She glared at me defiantly.

The onl y thing I kne w was that her body was not the body of an old wom an. She had beautifully muscular thighs , dark and ha irless. The bone structure of her hips was broad, but there was no fat on them.

Dona Soledad, in the meantime, had run out side the hous e and was standi ng by my car, looki ng puz zled at me. I walked ove r to her and asked her if don Juan had told her to do all that. She nodde d affirm atively. I asked if he was around. She said no. “Tell me everything, ” I said. She told me that she was merely follow ing don Juan’s orders. He had com mande d her to change her being into a warrior’s in order to help me. She declared that she had been waiting for years to fulfill that promise. “I’m very strong now ,” she said softly. “Just for you. But you disliked me in my room , didn’ t you? ” I found myself expl aining that I did not dislike her, that what count ed were my feelings for Pablito; then I realized th at I did not have the vague st idea of what I was saying. Dona Soledad seemed to unde rstand my embarrassing pos ition and said that our mishap had to be forgot ten. “You must be famished,” she said vivacious ly. “I’ll make you som e food. ” “There’s a lot that y ou haven’t expl ained to me,” I said. “I’ll be frank with you, I woul dn’ t stay here for anyt hing in the world.

That’l l be a laugh, ” she said giggl ing. I made up my mind then to be rude and get out of there, without any expl anation. But before I drove away I wanted to leave som e things for Pablito and his sisters. I ope ned the trunk of the car to get the gifts I had broug ht for them. I leaned way into it to reach first for the two packages that were lodge d against the wall of the back seat, behind the spare tire. I got hol d of one and was about to grab the other when I felt a soft, furry hand on the nape of my neck. I shri eked invol unt arily and hit my head on the ope n lid. I turned to look. The pressure of the furry hand did not let me turn com pletely, but I was able to catch a fleeting glimpse of a silvery arm or paw hove ring ove r my neck. I wriggl ed in panic and pus hed my self away from the trunk and fell dow n on my seat with the package still in my hand. My whol e body shook, the muscles of my legs cont racted and I found myself leaping up and runni ng away. “I didn’ t mean to fright en you, ” dona Soledad said apol oge tically, a s I watched her from ten feet away."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 She show ed me the palms of her hands in a gesture of surrende r, as if assuring me that what I had felt was not her hand. “What did you do to me?” I asked, trying to sound calm and detached.

She muttered som ething and shook her head as though she coul d not say it, or did not know what I was talking about . “Com e on, dona Soledad,” I said, com ing closer to her, “don’ t play tricks on me.” She seemed about to weep. I wanted to comfort her, but som e part of me resisted. After a mom ent’s pause I told her what I had felt and seen. “That’s just terrible!” She said in a shrieking voi ce. In a very childlike gesture she cove red her face with her right forearm. I thought she was crying. I came ove r to her and tried to put my arm aroun d her shoul ders.

She stom ped with her right foot, like a fencer, and reached out with clawed hands to gra b me by my waist as she let out the most chilling shriek. My body jum ped back out of her reach.

I did not know who scared me the most, dona Soledad or the dog. After a mom ent’s though t I decided that the dog was just a stupi d beast. I ran back to the car and climbed up on the roof . The noi se enraged the dog. I heard him ripp ing the uphol stery. Lying on the roof I managed to ope n the driver’s door . My idea was to ope n bot h doors and then slide from the roof into the car, through one of them, after the dog had gone out the other one . I leaned ove r to ope n the right door .

But he got into your old body. He put som ething in it. He did the same with me. He left som eth ing in me and that som ething took ove r. Only a devil can do that. Now I am the nor th wind and I fear not hing, and no one . But before he change d me I was a weak, ugl y old wom an who woul d faint at the mere mention of his name. Pablito, of cour se, was no hel p to me because he feared the Nagua l more than death itself. “One day the Nagua l and Genaro came to the hous e when I was alone . I heard them by the door , like prow ling jagu ars. I crossed myself; to me they were two demons , but I came out to see what I coul d do for them. They were hun gry and I gladly fixed food for them. I had som e thick bow ls made out of gour d and I gave each man a bow l of soup. The Nagua l didn’ t seem to appr eciate the food; he didn’ t want to eat food prepared by such a weak wom an and prete nde d to be clum sy and knoc ked the bow l off the table with a sweep of his arm. But the bow l, instead of turning ove r and spilling all ove r the floor, slid with the force of the Nagua l’s blow and fell on my foot , without spilling a drop. The bow l actually l ande d on my foot and stayed there unt il I bent ove r and picked it up. I set it up on the table in front of him and told him that even though I was a weak wom an and had always feared him, my food had good feelings. “From that very mom ent the Nagua l chang ed tow ard me. The fact that the bow l of soup fell on my foo t and didn’ t spill prove d to him that pow er had poi nted me out to him. I didn’ t know that at the time and I thought that he change d tow ard me because he felt ashamed of having refused my food. I thou ght not hing of his"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 change . I still was petrified and coul dn’ t even look him in the eye. But he began to take more and more not ice of me. He even brought me gifts: a shawl, a dress, a com b and other things . That made me feel terrible. I was ashamed because I thought that he was a man looki ng for a wom an. The Nagua l had young girls, what woul d he want with an old wom an like me? At first I didn’ t want to wear or even cons ider looki ng at his gifts, but Pablito prevailed on me and I began to wear them. I also be gan to be even more afraid of him and didn’ t want to be alone with him. I kne w that he was a devilish man. I kne w what he had done to his wom an.” I felt com pelled to interrup t her. I told her that I had never know n of a wom an in don Juan’s life. “You know who I mean,” she said. “Believe me, dona Soledad, I don’ t.” “Don’ t give me that. You know that I’m talking about la Gorda.” The onl y “la Gorda” I kne w of was Pablito’s sister, an enor mous ly fat girl nickna med Gorda, Fatso. I had had the feeling, although n o one ever talked about it, that she was not really dona Soledad’s daught er. I did not want to press her for any more information. I sudde nly remembered that the fat girl had disappe ared from the hous e and nobody coul d or dared to tell me what had happe ned to her. “One day I was alone in the front of the ho use,” dona Soledad went on. “I was com bing my hair in the sun with the com b that the Nagua l had given me; I didn’ t realize that he had arrived and was standi ng behind me. All of a sudde n I felt his hands grabbi ng me by the chin. I heard him say very softly that I shoul dn’ t move because my neck might break. He twisted my head to the left. Not all the way but a bit. I became very fright ened and screamed and tried to wriggl e out of his grip, but he held my he ad firmly for a long, long time. “When he let go of my chin, I fainted. I don’ t remember what happe ned then. When I woke up I was lying on the ground, right here where I’m sitting now ."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 The Nagua l was gone . I was so ashamed that I didn’ t want to see anyone , especially la Gorda. For a long time I even thought that the Nagua l had never twisted my neck and I had had a night mare.” She stoppe d. I waited for an expl anation of what had happe ned. She seemed distracted, pensive perhaps. “What exactly happe ned, dona S oledad?” I asked, incapable of cont aining myself. “Did he do som ething to you? ” “Yes. He twisted my neck in order to change the direction of my eyes,” she said and laughe d loudl y at my look of surprise. “I mean, did he. . . ?” “Yes. He change d my direction ,” she went on, obl ivious to my probe s. “He did that to you and to all the others.” “That’s true. He did that to me. But why do you think he did that?” “He had to. That is the most impor tant thing to do. ” She was referring to a peculiar act that don Juan h ad deemed absolutely necessary. I had never talked about it with anyone . In fact, I had almost forgot ten about it. At the beginni ng of my appr enticeship, he onc e bui lt two small fires in the mount ains of no rthern Mexico. They were perhaps twenty feet apart . He made me stand anot her twenty feet away from them, hol ding my bod y, especially my head, in a most relaxed and natural pos ition. He then made me face one fire, and com ing from behind me, he twisted my neck to the left, and aligne d my eyes, but not my sh oul ders, with the other fire. He held my head in that pos ition for hou rs, unt il the fire was extingui shed. The new direction was the sout heast, or rather he had aligne d the second fire in a sout heasterly direction. I had unde rstood the whol e affair as one of don Juan’s inscrutable peculiarities, one of his nons ensical rites. “The Nagua l said that all of us throughout our lives develop one direction to look, ” she went on. “That becom es the direction of the eyes of the spirit. Through"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 the years that direction becom es ove rused, and weak and unpl easant, and since we are bound to that particular direction we becom e weak and unpl easant our selves. The day the Nagua l twisted my neck and held it unt il I fainted out of fear, he gave me a new direction. ” “What directio n did he give you? ” “Why do you ask that?” she said with unne cessary force. “Do you think that perhaps the Nagua l gave me a different direction? ” “I can tell you the direction that he gave me,” I said. “Never mind, ” she snappe d. “He told me that himself.” She seemed agitated. She change d pos ition and lay on her stom ach. My back hur t from writing. I asked her if I coul d sit on her floor and use the bed as a table. She stood up and hande d me the folded bedspread to use as a cushion. “What else did the Nagua l do to you? ” I asked. “After changi ng my direction the Nagua l really began to talk to me about pow er,” she said, lying dow n again. “He mentione d things in a casual way at first, because he didn’ t know exactly what to do with me. One day he took me for a sh ort walking trip in the sierras. Then anot her day he took me on a bus to his hom eland in the desert. Little by little I became accustom ed to goi ng away with him.” “Did he ever give you pow er plants?” “He gave me Mescalito, onc e when we were in the desert. But since I was an empty wom an Mescalito refused me. I had a hor rid encount er with him. It was then that the Nagua l kne w that he ought to acqua int me with the wind instead. That was, of cour se, after he got an om en.

In desperation, I suppos e, he int roduc ed me to his gua je, and I saw Mescalito.” I interrupted her. Her use of the word “gua je,” gour d, was conf using to me. Examined in the cont ext of what she was telling me, the word had no meaning. I thought that perhaps she was speaking metaphor ically, or that gou rd was a euphe mism. “What is a gua je, dona Soledad?” There was a look of surprise in her eyes. She paused before answering. “Mescalito is the Nagua l’s gua je,” she finally said. Her answer was even more conf using. I felt mortified by the fact tha t she really seemed conc erned with making sense to me. When I asked her to expl ain further, she insisted that I kne w everything myself. That was don Juan’s favor ite stratagem to foil my probe s. I said to her that don Juan had told me that Mescalito was a d eity, or force cont ained in the peyot e but tons . To say that Mescalito was his gour d made absolutely no sense. “The Nagua l can acqua int you with anyt hing through his gour d,” she said after a pause. “That is the key to his pow er. Anyone can give you peyot e, but onl y a sorcerer, through his gour d, can acqua int you with Mescalito.” She stoppe d talking and fixed her eyes on me. Her look was ferocious . “Why do you have to make me repeat what you already know ?” she asked in an angr y tone . I was com pletely taken a back by her sudde n shift. A mom ent before she had been almost sweet. “Never mind my change s of mood, ” she said, smiling again. “I’m the nor th wind. I’m very impatient. All my life I never dared to speak my mind. Now I fear no one . I say what I feel. To m eet with me you have to be strong. ” She slid closer to me on her stom ach."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 “Well, the Nagua l acqua inted me with the Mescalito that came out of his gour d,” she went on. “But he coul dn’ t gue ss what woul d happe n to me. He expe cted som ething like your ow n meeti ng or Eligio’s meeting with Mescalito. In bot h cases he was at a loss and let his gour d decide what to do next. In bot h cases his gour d helped him. With me it was different; Mescalito told him never to bring me arou nd. The Nagua l and I left that place in a great hur ry. We went nor th instead of com ing hom e. We took a bus to go to Mexicali, but we got out in the middl e of the desert. It was very late. The sun was setting behind the mount ains. The Nagua l wanted to cross the road and go sout h on foot . We were w aiting for som e speeding cars to go by, when sudde nly he tappe d my shoul der and poi nted tow ard the road ahead of us. I saw a spiral of dus t. A gus t of wind was raising dus t on the side of the road. We watched it move tow ard us. The Nagua l ran across the ro ad and the wind enve lope d me. It actually made me spin very gently and then it vanished. That was the om en the Nagua l was waiting for. From then on we went to the mount ains or the desert for the pur pose of seeking the wind. The wind didn’ t like me at first , because I was my old self. So the Nagua l ende avor ed to change me. He first made me bui ld this room and this floor . Then he made me wear new clothes and sleep on a mattress instead of a straw mat. He made me wear shoe s, and have drawers full of clothes. H e forced me to walk hundr eds of miles and taught me to be qui et. I learned very fast. He also made me do strange things for no reason at all. “One day, while we were in the mount ains of his hom eland, I listened to the wind for the first time. It came dire ctly to my wom b. I was lying on top of a flat rock and the wind twirled arou nd me. I had already seen it that day whirling around the bus hes, but this time it came over me and stoppe d. It felt like a bird that had lande d on my stom ach. The Nagua l had made me take off all my clothes; I was stark naked but I was not cold because the wind was warming me up. ”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 “Were you afraid, dona Soledad?” “Afraid? I was petrified. The wind was alive; it licked me from my head to my toes. And then it got inside my whol e body. I was like a balloon, and the wind came out of my ears and my mout h and other parts I don’ t want to mention. I thought I was goi ng to die, and I woul d’ve run away had it not been that the Nagua l held me to the rock. He spoke to me in my ear and calmed me dow n. I lay qui etly and let the wind do whatever it wanted with me. It was then that it told me what to do. ” “What to do with what?” “With my life, my things , my room , my feelings . It was not clear at first. I thought it was me thinki ng. The Nagua l said th at all of us do that. When we are qui et, though, we realize that it is som ething else telling us things .” “Did you hear a voi ce?” “No. The wind move s inside the body of a wom an. The Nagua l says that that is so because wom en have wom bs. Once it’s inside the wom b the wind simply picks you up and tells you to do things . The more qui et and relaxed the wom an is the better the results. You may say that all of a sudde n the wom an finds herself doi ng things that she had no idea how to do. “From that day on the wind came to me all the time. It spoke to me in my wom b and told me everything I wanted to know . The Nagua l saw from the beginni ng that I was the nor th wind. Other winds never spoke to me like that, although I had learned to disting uish them.” “How many kinds o f winds are there?” “There are four winds , like there are four directions .

Blasting full of energy bu t also ful l of blind ness. It breaks through door s and brings dow n walls. A sorcerer must be terribly strong to tackle the hard wind. “Then there is the cold wind of the afternoo n. Sad and trying. A wind that woul d never leave you in peace. It will chill you and make you cry. The Nagua l said that there is such depth to it, though, that it is more than worthw hile to seek it. “And at last there is the hot wind. It warms and protects and enve lops everything. It is a night wind for sorcerers. Its pow er goe s toge ther with the darkne ss. “Thos e are the four winds . They are also associated with the four directions . The breeze is the east. The cold wind is the west. The hot one is the sout h.

The hot wind is happy and abandone d and bounc y. The hard wind is energetic and com mande ering and impatient. “The Nagua l told me that the four winds are wom en. That is why femal e warriors seek them. Winds and wom en are alike. That is also the reason why wom en are better than men. I woul d say that wom en learn faster if they cling to their specific wind. ” “How can a wom an know what her specific wind is?” “If the wom an qui ets dow n and is not talking to herself, her wind will pick her up, just like that.” She made a gesture of grabbi ng. “Does she have to lie naked?”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 “That helps. Especially if she is shy. I was a fat old wom an. I had never taken off my clothes in my life. I slept in them and when I took a bath I always had my slip on.

He kne w of the friends hip of wom en and the wind, but he introduc ed me to Mescalito because he was baffled by me. “After turning my head that first terrible day, the Nagua l found himself with me on his hands . He told me that he had no idea what to do with me. But one thing was for sure, he didn’ t want a fat old wom an snoopi ng around his world. Th e Nagua l said that he felt about me the way he felt about you. Baffled. Both of us shoul dn’ t be here. You’ re not an Ind ian and I’m an old cow .

A wom an change s very easily with the pow er of a sorcerer. Especially with the pow er of a sorcerer like the Nagua l. A male appr entice, according to the Nagua l, is extremely difficult. For example, you your self haven’t ch ange d as much as la Gorda, and she started her appr enticeship way after you did. A wom an is softer and more gentle, and above all a wom an is like a gour d; she receives. But som ehow a man com mands more pow er. The Nagua l never agreed with that, though. He be lieved that wom en are une qua led, tops . He also believed that I felt men were better onl y because I am an empty wom an. He must be right . I have been empty for so long that I can’t remember what it feels like to be com plete. The Nagua l said that if I ever be com e com plete I will change my feelings about it. But if he was right his Gorda woul d have done as well as Eligio, and as you kno w, she hasn’t.” I coul d not follow the flow of her narrative because of her uns tated assum ption that I kne w what she was referr ing to.

He w as like Genaro; one day while he was working in the field som ething came to him and took him away. He kne w how to let go. ” I felt like asking her if I had really jum ped into the abys s. I deliberated for a mom ent before goi ng ahead with my que stion. After a ll I had com e to see Pablito and Nestor to clarify that poi nt. Any information I coul d get on the topi c from anyone invol ved in don Juan’s world was inde ed a bonus tom e. She laughe d at my que stion, as I had anticipated. “You mean you don’ t know what you yo urself did?” she asked. “It’s too farfetched to be real,” I said. “That is the Nagua l’s world for sure. Not a thing in it is real. He himself told me not to believe anyt hing. But still the male appr entices have to jum p.

You, Pablito and Nestor jum ped on the same day.” “Who is the other appr entice of don Genaro?

He jumped before you did and he jum ped by himself.” Benigno was one of five Indi an yout hs I had onc e found while roaming in the Sonor an Desert with don Juan. They were in sea rch of pow er obj ects. Don Juan told me that all of them were appr entices of sorcery. I struck up a peculiar friends hip with Benigno in the few times I had seen him after that day. He was from sout hern Mexico. I liked him very much. For som e unknow n reason he seemed to delight himself by creating a tantalizing mystery about his persona l life. I coul d never find out who he was or what he did. Every time I talked to him he baffled me with the disarming candor with which he evaded my probe s. Once don Juan vol un teered som e information abou t Benigno and said that he was very fortunate in having found a teacher and a benefactor. I took don Juan’s statements as a casual remark that meant not hing. Don a Soledad had clarified a tenye arold mystery for me. “Why do you th ink don Juan never told me anyt hing about Benigno? ” “Who know s? He must’ve had a reason.

The same thing happe ned to the girls; they’re inseparable because the Nagua l’s brand is on them.” I had to int errup t her again and ask her to expl ain what girls she was talking about . “My girls,” she said. “Your daught ers? I mean Pablito’s sisters?” “They are not Pablito’s sisters. They are the Nagua l’s appr entices.” Her disclosure shoc ked me. Ever since I had met Pablito, years before, I had been led to believe that the four girls who lived in his hous e were his sisters. Don Juan himself had told me so. I had a sudde n relapse of the feeling of despair I had expe rienced all afterno on. Dona Soledad was not to be tru sted; she was engi neering som ething. I was sure that don Juan coul d not unde r any condi tions have misled me so grossly. Dona Soledad examined me with ove rt curiosity. “The wind just told me that you don’ t believe what I’m telling you, ” she said, and laughe d. “The wind is right ,” I said dryly. “The girls that you’ ve seen ove r the years are the Nagua l’s.

The girls are my true babies. Pablito, although he’s the child that came out of my wom b, is my mortal enemy.” My reaction to her statements was a mixture of revul sion and ange r.

The peopl e took the Nagua l for Vicente and placed the girl in his hands . The Nagua l told me that the girl ran t o him and clung to him as if she knew him. The Nagua l told her parents that they had to leave her with him. They were worried about the cost but the Nagua l assured them that it woul d be free. I suppos e that the girl was such a pain in the ass to them that they didn’ t mind getting rid of her. “The Nagua l brough t her to me. That was hell! She was truly crazy. That was Josefina. It took the Nagua l years to cure her. But even to this day she’s crazier than a bat. She was, of cour se, crazy about the Nagua l and t here was a terrible fight between Lidia and Josefina. They hated each other. But I liked them bot h. But the Nagua l, when he saw that they coul dn’ t get along, became very firm with them. As you know the Nagua l can’t get mad at anyone . So he scared them half to death. One day Lidia got mad and left. She had decided to find herself a young hus band. On the road she found a tiny chicken. It had just been hatched and was lost in the middl e of the road. Lidia picked it up, and since she was in a deserted area with no hous es around, she figur ed that the chicken belonge d to no"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 one . She put it inside her blous e, in between her breasts to keep it warm. Lidia told me that she ran and in doi ng so the little chicken began to move to her side. She tried to bring him back t o the front but she coul dn’ t catch him. The chicken ran very fast around her sides and her back, inside her blous e. The chicken’s feet tickled her at first and then they drove her crazy. When she realized that she coul dn’ t get him out , she came back to me, screaming out of her mind, and told me to get the damn thing out of her blous e. I undr essed her but that was to no avail. There was no chicken at all, and yet she still felt its feet on her skin goi ng around and around. “The Nagua l came ove r then and told her that onl y when she let go of her old self woul d the chicken stop runni ng. Lidia was crazy for three days and three night s. The Nagua l told me to tie her up. I fed her and cleaned her and gave her water. On the four th day she became very peaceful and c alm. I unt ied her and she put on her clothes and when she was dressed again, as she had been the day she ran away, the little chicken came out . She took him in her hand and petted and thanke d him and returned him to the place where she had found him. I wal ked with her part of the way. “From that time on Lidia never bot hered anyone . She accepted her fate. The Nagua l is her fate; without him she woul d have been dead. So what was the poi nt of trying to refuse or mold things which can onl y be accepted? “Josefin a went off next. She was already afraid of what happe ned to Lidia but she soon forgot about it. One Sunda y afternoon, when she was com ing back to the hous e, a dry leaf got stuck in the threads of her shawl. Her shawl was loos ely wove n. She tried to pick ou t the small leaf, but she was afraid of ruining her shawl. So when she came into the hous e she immediately tried to loos en it, but there was no way, it was stuck. Josefina, in a fit of anger, clutched the shawl and the leaf and crum bled it inside her hand. She figu red that small pieces woul d be easier to pick"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 out . I heard a madde ning scream and Josefina fell to the ground. I ran to her and found that she coul dn’ t ope n her hand. The leaf had cut her hand to shreds as if it were pieces of a razor blade. Lidia and I helped her and nur sed her for seven days. Josefina was more stubbor n than anyone else. She nearly died. At the end she managed to ope n her hand, but onl y after she had in her ow n mind resolved to drop her old ways. She still gets pains in her bod y f rom time to time, especially in her hand, due to the ugl y dispos ition that still returns to her. The Nagua l told bot h of them that they shoul dn’ t count on their victory because it’s a lifetime struggl e that each of us wages against our old selves. “Lidia a nd Josefina never fough t again. I don’ t think they like each other, but they certainly get along. I love thos e two the most. They have been with me all these years. I know that they love me too. ” “What about the other two girls? Where do they fit?” “A year later Elena came; she is la Gorda. She was by far in the worst condi tion you coul d imagine. She weighe d two hundr ed and twenty pou nds . She was a desperate wom an. Pablito had given her shelter in his shop. She did laundr y and ironi ng to suppo rt herself. Th e Nagua l came one night to get Pablito and found the fat girl working while a circle of moths flew ove r her head. He said that the moths had made a perfect circle for him to watch. He saw that the wom an was near the end of her life, yet the moths must have had all the conf idence in the world, in order for them to give him such an om en. The Nagua l acted fast and took her with him. “She did fine for a while, but the bad habits that she had learned were too deep and she coul dn’ t give them up. So one day the Na gua l sent for the wind to help her. It was a matter of helping her or finishing her off.

When the Nagua l finally foun d her she had managed to stop the wind, but she was too weak to walk.” “How did the girls manage to stop whatever was actin g upon them?” “Well, in the first place what was acting upon them was the gour d that the Nagua l carried tied to his belt.” “And what is in the gour d?” “The allies that the Nagua l carries with him. He said that the ally is funne led through his gou rd. Don’ t ask me any more because I know not hing more about the ally. All I can tell you is that the Nagua l commands two allies and makes them help him. In the case of my girls the ally backed dow n when they were ready to change . For them, of cour se, it was a case o f either change or death. But that’s the case with all of us, one way or anot her. And la Gorda change d more than anyone else. She was empty, in fact more empty than I, but she worked her spirit unt il she became pow er itself. I don’ t like her. I’m afraid o f her. She know s me.

She is like Eligio; the world no longe r touc hes her.” “What did the Nagua l do to her that was so special?” “He taught her things he never taugh t anyo ne else. He never pampered her or anyt hing like that. He trusted her. She know s everything about everyb ody. The Nagua l also told me everything except things about her. Maybe that’s why I don’ t like her. The Nagua l told her to be my jailer. Wherever I go I find her. She know s whatever I do.

He told me that he had gone with you to his hom eland. Eligio came to see you because he was curious about you. The Nagua l didn’ t not ice him. He had know n him since he was a kid. But one morning, as the Nagua l walked to the hous e where you were waiting for him, he bum ped into E ligio on the road. They walked toge ther for a shor t distance and then a dried piece of chol la got stuck on the tip of Eligio’s left shoe . He tried to kick it loos e but its thor ns were like nails; they had gone deep into the sole of the shoe . The Nagua l sa id that Eligio poi nted up to the sky with his finge r and shook his foot and the chol la came off like a bul let and went up into the air. Eligio thought it was a big joke and laughe d, but the Nagua l kne w that he had pow er, although Eligio himself didn’ t even suspect it. That is why, with no troubl e at all, he became the perfect, impeccable warrior. “It was my good fortune that I got to know him. The Nagua l thought that bot h of us were alike in one thing. Once we hook ont o som ething we don’ t let go of it. The good fortune of know ing Eligio was a fortune that I shared with no one else, not even with la Gorda. She met Eligio but didn’ t really get to know him, just like your self. The Nagua l kne w from the beginni ng that Eligio was exceptiona l and he isolated him. H e kne w that you and the girls were on one side of the coin and Eligio was by himself on the other side. The Nagua l and Genaro were inde ed very fortunate to have found him. “I first met him when the Nagua l brou ght him ove r to my hous e. Eligio didn’ t get alo ng with my girls.

He said that your touc h doe sn’t soot he, it spoi ls instead. He told me that your spirit takes prisone rs. He was som ehow revol ted by you and at the same time he liked you. He said that you were crazier than Josefina when he found you and that you still are.” It was an uns ettling feeling to hear som eon e else telling me what don Juan thought of me. At first I tried to disregard what dona Soledad was saying, but then I felt utterly stupi d and out of place trying to protect my ego. “He bot hered with y ou, ” she went on, “because he was com mande d by pow er to do so. And he, being the impeccable warrior he was, yielded to his master and gladly did what pow er told him to do with you. ” There was a pause. I was aching to ask her more about don Juan’s feelings about me. I asked her to tell me about her other girl instead. “A mont h after he found Eligio, the Nagua l found Rosa,” she said. “Rosa was the last one . Once he found her he kne w that his num ber was com plete.” “How did he find her?” “He had gone to see Ben igno in his hom eland. He was appr oaching the hous e when Rosa came out from the thick bus hes on the side of the road, chasing a pig that had got ten loos e and was runni ng away. The pig ran too fast for Rosa. She bum ped into the Nagua l and coul dn ’t catch up with the pig. She then turned against the Nagua l and began to yell at him. He made a gesture to grab her and she was ready to fight him. She insulted him and dared him to lay a hand on her. The Nagua l liked her spirit immediately but there was no om en. Th e Nagua l said that he waited a mom ent before walking away, and then the pig came runni ng back and stood beside him. That was the om en. Rosa put a rope around the pig.

The Nagua l said it was for work and she wanted to know how much he woul d pay. He gave her a figur e and then she asked what kind of work it was. The Nagua l said that it was to work with him in the toba cco fields of Veracruz. She told him then that she had been testing him; if he woul d have said he wanted her to work as a maid, she woul d have know n that he was a liar, because h e looke d like som eone who had never had a hom e in his life. The Nagua l was delight ed with her and told her that if she wanted to get out of the trap she was in she shoul d com e to Benigno’ s hous e before noon. He also told her that he woul d wait no longe r th an twelve; if she came she had to be prepared for a difficult life and plenty of work. She asked him how far was the place of the toba cco fields. The Nagua l said three days’ ride in a bus . Rosa said that if it was that far she woul d certainly be ready to g o as soon as she got the pig back in his pen. And she did just that. She came here and everyone liked her. She was never mean or bot hersom e; the Nagua l didn’ t have to force her or trick her into anyt hing. She doe sn’t like me at all, and yet she takes care of me better than anyone else. I trust her, and yet I don’ t like her at all, and when I leave I will miss her the most. Can you beat that?” I saw a flicker of sadne ss in her eyes. I coul d not sustain my distrust. She wiped her eyes with a casual move ment of her hand. There was a natural break in the conve rsation at that poi nt. It was getting dark by then and writing was very difficult; besides I had to go to the bathroom . She insisted that I use the out hous e before she did as the Nagua l himself woul d have done .

She told me in an author itative tone to wash myself in one of the tub s while she did the same in the other. The water had an almost perfum ed smell. It caused a ticklish sensation.

The window s were ope n and there was still light . It must have been close to seven. Dona Soledad lay on her back. She was smiling at me. I thought that she was the picture of warmth. But at the same time and in spite of her smile, h er eyes gave out a feeling of ruthlessness and unbe ndi ng force. I asked her how long she had been with don Juan as his wom an or appr entice. She made fun of my cautious ness in labeling her. Her answer was seven years. She reminde d me then that I had not see n her for five. I had been convi nced up to that poi nt that I had seen her two years before. I tried to remember the last time, but I coul d not . She told me to lie dow n next to her. I kne lt on the bed, by her side. In a very soft voi ce she asked me if I was afraid. I said no, which was the truth. There in her room , at that mom ent, I was being conf ront ed by an old respons e of mine, which had manifested itself count less times, a mixture of curiosity and suicidal indi fference. Almost in a whisper she said that she had to be impeccable with me and tell me that our meeting was crucial for bot h of us.

Sudde nly I kne w that I had, som ehow , been feeling her feelings all along. She was the strange one . She had mesmerized me with words. She was a cold, old wom an.

I expe rienced an exceptional clarity of hearing. I thoug ht that I must be dyi ng. I loathed my incapacity to do anyt hing to defend myself. I coul d not even move a muscle to kick her.

When I want to think about it I get dizzy.” I told her about my fleeting perception that she had left her body with the impact of my blow . I intende d to prod her with the account . It seemed to me that the reason behind the whol e event had been to force us to draw from sour ces that are ordinarily ba rred to us. I had pos itively given her a dreadful blow ; I had caused profound damage to her body, and yet I coul d not have done it myself. I did feel I had hit her with my left fist, the enor mous red lum p on her forehead attested to that, yet I had no swel ling in my knuc kles or the slight est pain or discom fort in them.

She raised herself and seemed to be on the verge of striking me, but she slum ped back. “You’ ve taken my soul ,” she said. “You must have it in your pouc h now . Why did you have to tell me, though? ” I swore to her that I had had no intentions of hur ting her, that I had acted in whatever form onl y in selfdefense and therefore I bor e no malice tow ard her. “If you don’ t have my soul in your pouc h, it’s even worse,” she said. “It must be roaming aimlessly around . I will never get it back, then.” Dona Soledad seemed to be voi d of energy. Her voi ce became weaker. I wanted her to go and lie dow n. She refused to leave the table. “The Nagua l said that if I failed com pletely I shoul d then give you his message,” she sai d. “He told me to tell you that he had replaced your body a long time ago.

I became very irritated with her. Her room in the darkne ss gave out a most eerie feeling. I went into the kitchen and got two lanterns and brought them back with me. At the sight of the light she screamed hys terically. I let out a yell myself but for a different reason. When the light hit the roo m I saw the floor curled up, like a cocoon, around her bed. My perception was so fleeting that the next instant I coul d have sworn that the shadow of the wire protective masks of the lanterns had created that gha stly scene. My pha ntom pe rception made me furious . I shook her by the shoul ders. She wept like a child and prom ised not to try any more of her tricks. I placed the lanterns on the chest of drawers and she fell asleep instantly. By midm orning the wind had change d. I felt a strong g ust com ing through the nor th window . Arou nd noon dona Soledad came out again. She seemed a bit wobbl y. The redne ss in her eyes had disappeared and the swelling of her forehead had diminished; there was hardly any visible lum p.

She smiled peacefully. “Oh, they are here!” she said sudde nly. “How fortuna t e for me. My girls are here. Now they’ll take care of me.” She seemed to have had a turn for the worse.

I intende d to wait for them there. I deliber ated whether to remain in the car or to sit casually on the left fende r. I opt ed to stand by the car door , ready to jum p in and drive away if som ething like the events of the previous day were goi ng to be repeated. I was very tired. I had not slept a wink for ove r twentyfour hou rs. My plan was to disclose to the young wom en as much as I coul d about the incident with dona Soledad, so they coul d take the necessary steps to aid her, and then I woul d leave. Their presence had brought about a definite change . E verything seemed to be charged with new vigor and energy. I felt the change when I saw dona Soledad surrounde d by them. Dona Soledad’s revelation that they were don Juan’s appr entices had given them such a tantalizing appe al that I coul d hardly wait to mee t them. I wonde red if they were like dona Soledad. She had said that they were like myself and that we were goi ng in the same direction. That coul d be easily interpreted in a pos itive sense. I wanted to believe that more than anyt hing else. Don Juan used t o call them “las hermanitas,” the little sisters, a most befitting name at least for the two I had met, Lidia and Rosa, two wispy, pixielike, charming youn g wom en.

I had deduc ed from passing remar ks made by don Juan that they were som ehow freakish, one was crazy and the other obe se; thus they were kept in isolation. Once I bum ped into Josefina as I walked into the hous e with don Juan. He introduc ed me to her, but she cove red her face and ran away b efore I had time to greet her. Anot her time I caught Elena washing clothes. She was enor mous . I thought that she must be suffering from a glandul ar disorder. I said hello to her but she did not turn around. I never saw her face. After the bui ldup that dona Soledad had given them with her disclosure, I felt driven to talk with the mysterious “hermanitas,” and at the same time I was almost afraid of them. I casually looke d dow n the driveway, bracing myself to meet all of them at onc e. The driveway was deserte d. There was no one appr oaching, and onl y a minut e before they had been no more than thirty yards from the hous e. I climbed up on the roof of the car to look. There was no one com ing, not even the dog. I panicked. I slid dow n and was about to jum p in the c ar and drive away when I heard som eone say, “Hey, look who’ s here.” I qui ckly turned around to face two girls who had just steppe d out of the hous e. I deduc ed that all of them must have run ahead of me and entered the hous e through the back door . I sighe d with relief. The two young girls came tow ard me. I had to adm it to myself that I had never really not iced them before. They were beautiful, dark and extremely lean, but without being skinn y. Their long black hair was braided.

They must have been about"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 five feet three or five feet four inches. They seemed to be very phys ical; they move d with great prowess. One of them was Lidia, the other was Rosa. I greeted them, and then in uni son they initiated a hands hake. They flanke d me. They looke d healthy and vigor ous. I asked them to help me get the packages out of the trunk. As we were carrying them into the hous e, I he ard a deep grow l, so deep and near that it seemed more like a lion’s roar. “What was that?” I asked Lidia. “Don’ t you know ?” she asked with a tone of disbelief. “It must be the dog, ” Rosa said as they ran into the hous e, practically draggi ng me with them. We placed the packages on the table and sat on two benches. Both girls were facing me. I told them that dona Soledad was very ill and that I was about to take her to the hos pital in the city, since I did not know what else to do to help her. As I spoke I r ealized that I was treading on dange rous groun d. I had no way of assessing how much information I shoul d divul ge to them about the true nature of my bout with dona Soledad. I began to look for clues. I thought that if I watched carefully, their voi ces or t he expr ession on their faces woul d betray how much they kne w. But they remained silent and let me do all the talking. I began to doubt that I shoul d vol unt eer any information at all. In my effort to figu re out what to do and not blunde r, I ende d up talking nons ense. Lidia cut me off. In a dry tone she said that I shoul d not conc ern myself with do na Soledad’s health because they had already taken steps to help her. That statement forced me to ask her if she kne w what dona Soledad’s trou ble was. “You’ ve take n her soul ,” she said accusingl y. My first reaction was to defend myself. I began to talk vehemently but ende d up cont radicting myself. They stared at me. I was making no sense at all. I tried"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 again to say the same thing in a different way. My fatigue was so intense that I coul d hardly organize my thought s. Finally I gave up. “Where are Pablito and Nestor?” I asked after a long pause. “They’ll be here shor tly,” Lidia said briskly. “Were you with them?” I asked. “No! “ she exclaimed, and stared at me. “We ne ver go toge ther,” Rosa expl ained. “Thos e bum s are different from us.” Lidia made an imperative gesture with her foot to shut her up. She seemed to be the one who gave the orders. Catching the move ment of her feet brought to my awareness a most peculiar fac et of my relations hip with don Juan. In the count less times that we had roamed toge ther, he had succeeded in teaching me, without really trying, a system of cove rt com muni cation throug h som e code d move ments of the feet. I watched Lidia give Rosa the sign f or hor rible, a sign given when anyt hing that happe ns to be in sight of the signe rs is unpl easant or dange rous . In this case me. I laughe d. I remembered that don Juan had given me that sign when I first met don Genaro. I pretende d not to be aware of what wa s goi ng on in order to find out if I coul d decode all their signs . Rosa made the sign that she wanted to step on me. Lidia answered with an imperative sign for no. According to don Juan, Lidia was very talented. As far as he was conc erned she was more sens itive and alert than Pablito and Nestor and myself. I had always been incapable of making friends with her. She was aloof , and very cutting. She had enor mous , black, shifty eyes that never looke d straight at anyone , high cheekbone s and a chiseled nos e, wh ich was a bit flat and broad at the bridge . I remembered her having red, sore eyelids and everyone taunt ing her on account of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 that. The redne ss of her eyelids had disappeared but she cont inue d to rub her eyes and blink a great deal. During my years of ass ociation with don Juan and don Genaro I had seen Lidia the most, and yet we had proba bly never exchange d more than a doz en words with each other. Pablito regarded her as a most dange rous being. I always thought she was just extremely shy. Rosa, on the othe r hand, was very boi sterous . I thought she was the younge st. Her eyes were very frank and shiny. She was never shifty, but very badtempered. I had talked with Rosa more than anyone else. She was friendl y, very bol d and very funny. “Where are the others?” I asked Rosa. “Aren’t they goi ng to com e out ?” “They will be out shor tly,” Lidia answered. I coul d tell from their expr essions that friendliness was not what they had in mind. Judgi ng from their foot messages they were as dange rous as dona Soledad, and yet as I sat there looki ng at them it occurred to me that they were gor geous ly beautiful. I had the warmest feelings for them. In fact, the more they stared into my eyes the more intense that feeling became. At one mom ent it was sheer passion that I felt for them. They were so alluring that I coul d have sat there for hour s just looki ng at them, but a sobe ring thought made me stand up. I was not goi ng to repeat my bungl ing of the night before. I decided that the best defense was to put my cards on the table. In a firm tone I told them that don Juan had set up som e sort of trial for me using dona Soledad, or vice versa. Chances were that he had also set them up in the same fashion, and we were goi ng to be pitted against one anot her in som e sort of battle that cou ld result in injury to som e of us. I appe aled to their sense of warriorship. If they were the truthful heirs of don Juan, they had to be impeccable with me, reveal their designs and not behave like ordinary, greedy hum an beings ."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 I turned to Rosa and asked her the reason for wishing to step on me. She was taken aback for an instant and then she became angr y. Her eyes flared with rage; her small mout h cont racted. Lidia, in a very cohe rent manne r, said that I had not hing to fear from them, and that Rosa was an gry with me because I had hur t dona Soledad. Her feelings were pur ely a persona l reaction. I said then that it was time I left. I stood up. Lidia made a gesture to stop me. She seemed scared or deeply conc erned. She began to protest, when a noi se com ing f rom out side the door distracted me. The two girls jum ped to my side. Som ething heavy was leaning or pus hing against the door . I not iced then that the girls had secured it with the heavy iron bar. I had a feeling of disgus t. The whol e affair was goi ng to be repeated again and I was sick and tired of it all. The girls glanced at each other, then looke d at me and then looke d at each other again. I heard the whining and heavy breathing of a large animal out side the hous e. It might have been the dog. Exha ustion blinded me at that poi nt. I rushed to the door , remove d the heavy iron bar and started to ope n it. Lidia threw herself against the door and shut it again. “The Nagua l was right ,” she said, out of breath. “You think and think. You’ re dum ber than I thoug ht.” She pul led me back to the table. I rehearsed, in my mind, the best way to tell them, onc e and for all, that I had had enoug h. Rosa sat next to me, touc hing me; I coul d feel her leg nervous ly rub bing against mine.

"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 I began to speak but I did not finish. I had a sudde n and most profound awareness. My body was aware of a greenish light , a fluor escence out side the hous e.

The light was movi ng at a great speed. I coul d sense it with my stom ach . I follow ed it, or rather I focused my attention on it for an instant as it move d around. A great clarity of mind ensued from focusing my attention on the light . I kne w then that in that hous e, in the presence of thos e peopl e, it was wrong and dange rous to behave as an innoc ent bys tande r. “Aren’t you afraid?” Rosa asked, poi nting to the door . Her voi ce disrupt ed my conc entration. I adm itted that whatever was there was scaring me at a very deep level, enough to make me die of frigh t. I wanted to say more, but right then I had a surge of wrath and I wanted to see and talk with dona Soledad. I did not trust her. I went directly to her roo m. She was not there. I began to call her, bellow ing her name. The hous e had one more room . I pus hed the door ope n and ru shed inside. There was no one in there.

She seemed to be frozen on the spot . “We are the same,” she said sudde nly. “The Nagua l told us that.” “Tell me, then, what was prow ling around the hous e?” I asked. “The ally,” she said."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 “Where is it now ?” “It is still here.

She know s everything. ” Rosa asked me if she coul d close the door , just to be on the safe side. Without waiting for an answer she inched her way to the door and slammed it shut . “There is not hing we can do except wait unt il everyone is here,” she said. Lidia came back into the room with a package, an obj ect wrappe d up in a piece of dark yellow cloth. She seemed very relaxed. I not iced that she had a most com mande ering touc h. Som ehow she imparted her mood to Rosa and myself. “Do you know what I have here?” she asked me. I did not have the vague st idea. She began to unw rap it in a very deliberate manne r, taking her time. Then she stoppe d and looke d at me. She seemed to vacillate. She grinne d as if she were too shy to show what was in the bundl e. “This package was left by the Nagua l for you, ” she muttered, “but I think we’d better wait for la Gorda .” I insisted that she unw rap it. She gave me a ferocious look and took the package out of the room withou t saying anot her word. I enjoye d Lidia’s game. She had performed som ething qui te in line with don Juan’s teachings . She had given me a demons tration o f how to get the best use out of an average situation. By bringi ng the package to me and pretendi ng that she was goi ng to ope n it, after disclosing that don Juan had left it for me, she had inde ed created a mystery that was almost unbe arable. She kne w tha t I had to stay if I wanted to find out the cont ents of that package. I coul d think of a num ber of things that might be in that bundl e. Perhaps it was the pipe don Juan used when"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 handl ing psychot ropi c mushroom s. He had intimated that the pipe woul d be give n to me for safekeeping. Or it might have been his kni fe, or his leather pouc h, or even his sorcery pow er obj ects. On the other hand, it might have been merely a ploy on Lidia’s part; don Juan was too sophi sticated, too abstract to leave me an heirloo m. I told Rosa that I was dead on my feet and weak from hunge r. My idea was to drive to the city, rest for a coupl e of days and then com e back to see Pablito and Nestor. I said that by then I might even get to meet the other two girls. Lidia returned then and R osa told her of my intention to leave. “The Nagua l gave us orders to attend to you as if you were himself,” Lidia said. “We are all the Nagua l himself, but you are even more so, for som e reason that no one unde rstands .” Both of them talked to me at onc e an d gua ranteed in various ways that no one was goi ng to attempt anyt hing against me as dona Soledad had. Both of them had such a fierce look of hone sty in their eyes that my body was ove rwhelmed. I trusted them. “You must stay unt il la Gorda com es back,” Lid ia said. “The Nagua l said that you shoul d sleep in his bed,” Rosa adde d. I began to pace the floor in the throes of a weird dilemma. On the one hand, I wanted to stay and rest; I felt phys ically at ease and happy in their presence, som ething I had not fel t the day before with dona Soledad. My reasona ble side, on the other hand, had not relaxed at all. At that level, I was as fright ened as I had been all along. I had had mom ents of blind despair and had taken bol d actions , but after the mom entum of thos e ac tions had ceased, I had felt as vul nerable as ever. I enga ged in som e soul searching analysis as I paced the room almost frantically. The two girls remained qu iet, looki ng at me anxi ous ly. Then all of a sudde n the riddl e was solved; I kne w that som ething in me was just pretendi ng to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 be afraid. I had becom e accustom ed to reacting that way in don Juan’s presence. Throughout the years of our association I had relied heavily on him to furnish me with conve nient pacifiers for my fright . My depende ncy on him had given me solace and security. But it was no longe r tenable. Don Juan was gone . His appr entices did not have his patience, or his sophi stication, or his sheer com mand. With them my need to seek solace was plain stupi dity. The girls led me to the other roo m . The window faced the sout heast, and so did the bed, which was a thick mat, like a mattress. A twofoot long, bul ky piece of mague y stalk had been carved so that the porous tissue served as a pillow , or a neckrest. In the middl e part of it there was a gentl e dip. The surface of the mague y was very smoot h. It appe ared to have been hand rubbe d. I tried the bed and the pillow . The com fort and bodi ly satisfaction I expe rienced were unus ual. Lying on don Juan’s bed I felt secure and fulfilled. An une qua led peace swept through my body. I had had a similar feeling onc e before when don Juan had made a bed for me on top of a hill in the desert in nor thern Mexico. I fell asleep. I woke up in the early evening. Lidia and Rosa were nearly on top of me, sound asleep. I st ayed motionl ess for one or two seconds , then bot h of them woke up at onc e. Lidia yawned and said that they had had to sleep next to me in order to protect me and make me rest. I was famished. Lidia sent Rosa to the kitchen to make us som e food. In the mea ntime she lit all the lanterns in the hous e. When the food was ready we sat dow n at the table. I felt as if I had know n them or been with them all my life. We ate in silence. When Rosa was clearing the table I asked Lidia if all of them slept in the Nagua l ’s bed; it was the onl y other bed in the hous e besides dona Soledad’s. Lidia said, in a matteroffact tone , that they had move d out of that hous e years before to a"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 place of their ow n in the same vicinity, and that Pablito had also move d when they did and li ved with Nestor and Benigno. “But what’s happe ned to you peopl e?

The Nagua l joined us and the Nagua l took us apart.” “And where’ s the Nagua l now ?” I asked in the most casual tone I coul d affect. Both of them looke d at me and then glanced at each other. “Oh, we don’ t know ,” Lidia said. “He and Genaro left.” She seemed to be telling the truth, but I insisted onc e more that they tell me what they kne w. “We really don’ t know anyt hing, ” Lidia snappe d at me, obvi ous ly flustered by my que stions . “They move d to anot her area. You have to ask that que stion of la Gorda. She has som ething to tell you. She kne w yesterday that you had com e and we rushed all night to get here. We were afraid that you were dead. The Nagua l told us that you are the onl y one we shoul d help and trust. He said that you are himself.” She cove red her face and giggl ed and then adde d as an afterthought , “But that’s hard to believe.” “We don’ t know you, ” Rosa said. “That’s the troubl e. The four of us feel the same way. We were afraid that you were dead and then when we saw you, we got mad at you for not being dead. Soledad is like our mother; maybe more than that.” They excha nge d cons piratorial looks with each other. I immediately interpreted that as a sign of troubl e. They were up to no good. Lidia not iced my sudde n distrust, which must have been written all ove r my face. She reacted with a series of assertions about their de sire to help me. I really had no reason to doubt"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 their sincerity. If they had wanted to hur t me they coul d have done so while I was asleep. She sounde d so earnest that I felt petty. I decided to distribut e the gifts I had brought for them.

In a very pol ite tone she adde d that they woul d be grateful if I woul d also cure Soledad. “ What do you think I shoul d do to cure her?” I asked her after a long silence. “Use your doubl e,” she said in a matteroffact tone . I carefully went ove r the fact that dona Soledad had nearly assassinated me and that I had survived by the grace of som ething in me, which was neither my skill nor my know ledge. As far as I was concerned that unde fined som ething that seemed to have delivered a blow to her was real, but unr eachable. In shor t, I coul d not help dona Soledad any more than I coul d walk to the moon. T hey listened to me attentively and remained qui et but agitated. “Where is dona Soledad now ?” I asked Lidia. “She’s with la Gorda,” she said in a despon dent tone . “La Gorda took her away and is trying to cure her, but we really don’ t know where they are. Th at’s the truth.” “And where’s Josefina?” “She went to get the Witness. He is the onl y one who can cure Soledad. Rosa thinks that you know more than the Witness, but since you’ re angr y with Soledad, you want her dead. We don’ t blame you. ” I assured them th at I was not angr y with her, and above all I did not want her dead. “Cure her, then!” Rosa said in an angr y, highpi tched voi ce. “The Witness has told us that you always know what to do, and the Witness can’t be wrong. ” "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 “And who in the devil is the Witnes s?” “Nestor is the Witness,” Lidia said as if she were reluctant to voi ce his name. “You know that. You have to.” I remembered that du ring ou r last meeting don Genaro had called Nestor the Witness. I thought at the time that the name was a joke or a ploy t hat don Genaro was using to ease the grippi ng tension and the angui sh of thos e last mom ents toge ther. “That was no joke ,” Lidia said in a firm tone . “Genaro and the Nagua l follow ed a different path with the Witness. They took him alon g with them everyw here they went. And I mean everyw here! The Witness has witnessed all there is to witness.” Obvi ous ly there was a tremendous misunde rstandi ng between us. I labor ed to expl ain that I was practically a strange r to them. Don Juan had kept me away from everyone , in cludi ng Pablito and Nestor. Outside of the casual hellos and goodbye s that all of them had exchange d with me ove r the years, we had never actually talked. I kne w all of them mainly through the descriptions that don Juan had given me. Although I had onc e me t Josefina I coul d not remember what she looke d like, and all I had ever seen of la Gorda was her gigantic behind. I said to them that I had not even know n, unt il the day before, that the four of them were don Juan’s appr entices, and that Benigno was part of the group as well. They exchange d a coy look with each other. Rosa move d her lips to say som ething but Lidia gave her a com mand with her feet. I felt that after my lon g and soul ful expl anation they shoul d not still sneak messages to each other. My nerve s were so taut that their cove rt foot move ments were just the thing to send me into a rage. I yelled at them at the top of my lungs and bange d on the table with my right hand.

It came dow n on the table with a thunde rous noi se. I heard again, as I had heard the night before while dona Soledad was choki ng me, a most peculiar and mysteriou s sound, a dry sound like a pipe breaking, right behind my windpi pe at the base of my neck. My ears poppe d, and with the speed of light ning my le ft arm came dow n on top of Rosa’s stick and crushed it. I saw the whol e scene myself, as if I had been watching a movi e. Rosa screamed and I realized then that I had leaned forward with all my weight and had struck the back of her hand with my left fist. I was appa lled. Whatever was happe ning to me was not real. It was a night mare. Rosa kept on screaming. Lidia took her into don Juan’s room . I heard her yells of pain for a few mom ents longe r and then they stoppe d. I sat dow n at the table. My thought s were disassociated and incohe rent. The peculiar sound at the base of my neck was som ething I had becom e keenly aware of. Don Juan had described it as the sound one makes at the mom ent of changi ng speed. I had the faint recollection of having expe rienced it in h is com pany. Although I had becom e aware of it the previous night , I had not fully acknow ledge d it unt il it happe ned with Rosa. I realized then that the sound had created a special sensation of heat on the roof of my mout h and inside my ears. The force and dryne ss of the sound made me think of the peal of a large, cracked bell. Lidia returned awhile later. She seemed more calm and collected. She even smiled. I asked her to please help me unr avel that riddl e and tell me what had happe ned. After a long vacill ation she told me that when I had yelled and bange d on the table Rosa got excited and nervous , and believing I was goi ng to hur t them, she had tried to strike me with her “dream hand. ” I had dodge d her blow and hit"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 her on the back of her hand, the same way I had struck dona Soledad. Lidia said that Rosa’s hand woul d be useless unl ess I found a way to help her. Rosa walked into the room then. Her arm was wrappe d with a piece of cloth. She looke d at me. Her eyes were like thos e of a child. My feelings were at the height of turmoil. Som e part of me felt ug ly and gui lty. But again anot her part remained unr uffled. Had it not been for that part I woul d not have survived either dona Soledad’s attack or Rosa’s devastating blow . After a long silence I told them that it was very petty of me to be annoye d by their foot messages, but that there was no com parison between yelling or bangi ng on the table and what Rosa had done . In view of the fact that I had no familiarity with their practices, she coul d have severed my ar m with her blow . I demande d, in a very intimidating tone , to see her hand. She reluctantly unw rappe d it. It was swollen and red. There was no doubt left in my mind that these peopl e were carrying out som e sort of test that don Juan had set up for me. By c onf ront ing them I was being hur led into a realm which was impos sible to reach or accept in rationa l terms. He had said time and time again that my rationa lity com prised onl y a very small part of what he had called the totality of one self. Unde r the impact of the unf amiliar and the altoge ther real dange r of my phys ical anni hilation, my body had had to make use of its hidde n resour ces, or die. The trick seemed to be in the truthful acceptance of the pos sibility that such resour ces exist and can be reached. Th e years of training had been but the steps to arrive to that acceptance. Truthful to his premise of no com prom ise, don Juan had aimed at a total victory or a total defeat for me. If the training had failed to put me in cont act with my hidde n resour ces, the test woul d have made it evident, in which case there woul d have been very little I coul d have done . Don Juan had said to dona Soledad that I woul d have killed myself.

Lidia had said that I coul d help Rosa and dona Soledad with the same force that had caused them injury; the probl em, therefore, was to get the right seque nce of feelings , or thought s, or whatever, that led my body to unl eash that force. I took Rosa’s hand and rubbe d it. I willed it to be cured. I had onl y the best feelings for her. I caressed her hand and hugge d her for a long time. I rubbe d her head and she fell asleep on my shoul der but there was no change in the redne ss or the swelling. Lidia watched me withou t saying a word. She smiled at me. I wanted to tell her that I was a fiasco as a healer. Her eyes seemed to catch my mood and they held it unt il it froze. Rosa wanted to sleep. She was either dead tired or ill. I did n ot want to find out which. I picked her up in my arms; she was light er than I woul d have imagined. I took her to don Juan’s bed and gently placed her on it. Lidia cove red her. The room was very dark. I looke d out of the window and saw a cloudl ess sky fill ed with stars. Up to that mom ent I had been obl ivious to the fact that we were at a very high altitude .

As we reached the door I felt her whol e body stiffening. I had to pul l her. I was about to cross the threshol d when I caught sight o f the bul ky, dark mass of a hum an body huddl ed against the wall oppos ite the door . The sight was so une xpe cted that I gasped and let go of Lidia’s hand. It was dona Soledad. She was resting her head against the wall. I turned to Lidia. She had recoiled a c oupl e of steps. I wanted to whisper that dona Soledad had returned, but there were no sounds to my words although I was sure I had voc alized them. I woul d have tried to talk again had it not been that I had an urge to act. It was as if words took too much time and I had very little of it. I stepp ed into the room and walked ove r to dona Soledad. She appe ared to be in great pain. I squa tted by her side, and rather than asking her anyt hing, I lifted her face to look at her. I saw som ething on her forehead; it looke d like the plaster of leaves that she had made for herself. It was dark, viscous to the touc h. I felt the imperative need to peel it off her forehead. In a very bol d fashion I grabbed her head, tilled it back and yanke d the plaster off. It was like p eeling off rubbe r. She did not move or com plain about pain. Unde rneath the plaster there was a yellow ishgr een blotch. It move d, as if it were alive or imbue d with energy. I looke d at it for a mom ent, una ble to do anyt hing. I poke d it with my finge r and it stuck to it like glue. I did not panic as I ordinarily woul d have; I rather liked the stuff. I stirred it with the tips of my finge rs and all of it came off her forehead. I stood up. The goo ey subs tance felt warm. It was like a sticky paste for an instant and then it dried up between my finge rs and on the palm of my hand. I then felt anot her jolt of appr ehension and ran to don Juan’s room .

Lidia had a cloth around my shoul ders and was wiping the sweat off my face. My nor mal thought processes came back to me all at onc e. I looke d around the roo m. Rosa was sound asleep. I ran to dona Soledad’s room . I expe cted to find her also asleep, but there was no one there. Lidia had trailed behind me. I told her what had happe ned. She rushed to Rosa and woke her up while I put on my clothes. Rosa did not wa nt to wake up. Lidia grabbe d her injured hand and sque ezed it. In one singl e, springi ng move ment Rosa stood up and was fully awake. They began to rush around the hous e turning off the lanterns. They seemed to be getting ready to run away.

I turned casually to look at them. The headlight s cast a glare inside the car and their eyes were like mirrors that reflected it. I remembered tha t do n Juan’s eyes did the same; they seemed to reflect more light than the eyes of an average person. I kne w that the two girls were aware of my impasse. Rather than making a joke about it in order to cove r up my incapacity, I blunt ly put the respons ibilit y of a solution in their laps. I said that I lacked practice as the Nagua l and woul d appr eciate it if they woul d obl ige me with a sugge stion or a hint as to where we shoul d go. They seemed disgus ted with me. They clicked their tongue s and shook their heads . I mentally shuf fled through various cour ses of action, none of which was feasible, such as driving them to tow n, or taking them to Nestor’s hous e, or even taking them to Mexico City. I stoppe d the car. I was driving tow ard tow n. I wanted more than anyt hi ng else in the world to have a hearttohe art talk with the girls.

I had not seen her in an ordinary sense. What I had thought was dona Soledad huddl ed against the wall was in fact the memory of her leaving her body the instant after I had hit her. I also kne w that when I touc hed that gooe y, phos phor escent subs tance I had cured her, and that it was som e sort of energy I had left in her head and in Rosa’s hand with my blow s. A vision of a particular ravine went throug h my mind. I became convi nced that dona Soledad and la Gorda were there. My know ledge was not a mere conj ecture, it was rather a truth that needed no further corrob oration. La Gorda had taken dona Soledad to the bot tom of that particular ravine and was at that precise mom ent attempting to cure her. I wanted to tell her that it was wrong to treat the swelling in dona Soledad’s forehead and that there was no longe r a need for them to stay there. I described my vision to the girls. Both of them told me, the way don Juan used to tell me, not to indu lge. With him, how ever, that reaction was more congr uous . I had never really minde d his criticisms or scorn, but the two girls were in a different league . I felt insulted. “I’ll take you hom e,” I said. “Where do you live?” Lidia turned to me and in a most furious tone said that bot h of them were my wards and that I had to deliver them to safety, since at the reque st of the Nagua l they had relinqui shed their freedom to act in order to help me.

I kne w then of som ethi ng transcende ntal. Unde r the impact of dona Soledad and the little sisters’ actions , my body had suspende d judgm ent; I had, in don Juan’s terms, stoppe d the world. I had amalgamated two disassociated sensations . The ticklishne ss on the very top of my head and the dry cracking sound at the base of my neck: between them lay the means to that suspension of judgm ent. As I sat in my car with thos e two girls, on the side of a deserted mount ain road, I kne w for a fact that for the first time I had had a com plete awareness of stoppi ng the world. That feeling brough t to my mind the memory of anot her, similar, firsttime bodi ly awareness I had had years before. It had to do with the ticklishne ss on top of the head. Don Juan said that sorcerers had to cultivate such a sensation and he described it at great lengt h. According to him, it was a sort of itching, which was neither pleasurable nor painful, and which occurred on the very top of one ’s head. In order to make me aware of it, on an intellectual level, he described and analyzed its features and then, on the practical side, he attempted to gui de me in developi ng the necessary bodi ly awareness and memory of this feeling by making me run unde r branches or rocks that protrude d on a hor izont al plane a few inches above my height . For years I tried to follow what he was poi nting out to me, but on the one hand I was incapable of unde rstandi ng what he meant by his description, and on the other hand I was incapable of provi ding my body with the adequa te memory by follow ing his pragm atic steps. Never did I feel anyt hing on top of my head as I ran unde rneath the branches or rocks he had selected for his demons trations. But one day my body by itself discove red the sensation while I was driving a high panel truck into a threestory parking structure. I entered the gate of the structure at the same speed I usually did in my small, twodoor sedan; the result was that from the high seat of the truck I perceived the transverse cement beam of the roof com ing at"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 my head. I coul d not stop th e truck in time and the feeling I got was that the cement beam was scalping me. I had never driven a motor vehicle which was as high as that truck, thus I was incapable of making the necessary perceptual adjustments. The space between the roof of the truck and the roof of the parking structure seemed none xistent for me. I felt the beam with my scalp. That day I drove for hour s inside the structure, giving my body a chance to store the memory of that ticklish sensation. I faced the two girls and wanted to te ll them that I had just found out where they lived. I desisted. There was no way of describing to them that the ticklish sensation had made me remember a casual remark that don Juan had onc e made as we passed a hous e on our way to Pablito’s place. He had p ointed out an unus ual feature in the surroun dings and said that that hous e was an ideal place for qui etness but was not a place to rest. I drove them there. Their hous e was rather big. It was also an adobe structure with a tile roo f like dona Soledad’s. It had one long room in the front , a roof ed, ope nair kitchen in back of the hous e, a huge patio next to the kitchen and an area for chickens beyond the patio. The most impor tant part of their hous e, how ever, was a closed room with two door s, one ope ning to t he front room and the other to the back. Lidia said that they had bui lt it themselves. I wanted to see it, but bot h of them said that it was not the appr opr iate time because Josefina and la Gorda were not present to show me the parts of the room that belon ged to them. In the corner of the front roo m there was a sizable, bui ltin brick platform. It was about eight een inches high and had been cons tructed like a bed with one end against the wall.

There was enough light to write. I expl ained to them that writing eased my tension and asked if it bot hered them. “Why do you have to ask?” Lidia re torted. “Just do it!” In the vein of a perfunc tory expl anation I told them that I had always done som e things , such as taking not es, which were strange even to don Juan and don Genaro and woul d perforce be strange to them. “We all do strange things ,” Lidia said dryly. I sat dow n on the bed unde r the lantern, with my back against the wall. They lay dow n next to me, one on each side. Rosa cove red herself with a blanke t and went to sleep as if all she needed to do was to lie dow n. Lidia said that then was the appr opr iate time and place for us to talk, although she woul d prefer that I turn off the light because it made her sleepy. Our conve rsation in the darkne ss centered around the whereabou ts of the other two girls. She said that she coul d not even imagine wh ere la Gorda was, but that Josefina was undoubt edly in the mount ains, still looki ng for Nestor, even though it was dark. She expl ained that Josefina was the most capable one to take care of herself in eventualities such as being in a deserted place in the dark. That was the reason why la Gorda had selected her to run that errand. I mentione d that in listening to them talk about la Gorda I had formed the opi nion that she was the bos s. Lidia replied that la Gorda was inde ed in charge, and that the Nagua l hims elf had put her in com mand. She adde d that even if he had not done so, la Gorda woul d have taken ove r, soone r or later, because she was the best. I was com pelled at that poi nt to light the lantern in order to write.

He had said time and time again that I was empty and I unde rstood him the way any Western man woul d unde rstand that statement.

The Nagua l said that men, most of the time, cannot tell who had emptied them.

It was on bot h sides, which meant that a man and a wom an emptied her.” “What did dona Soledad do with a man and a wom an? ” “She gave her com pleteness to them.” I vacillated for a mom ent before asking the next que stion. I wanted to assess all the implications of her statement. “La Gorda was even worse than Soledad,” Lidia went on. “Two wom en emptied her. The hol e in her stom ach was like a cavern.

We are the same.” The phr ase “we are the same,” which dona Sole dad had used the night before, brough t on an avalanche of thought s and fears. I put my writing pad away. I looke d around. I was in a strange world lying in a strange bed in between two young wom en I did not know . And yet I felt at ease there. My body expe r ienced abandon and indi fference.

I closed my eyes to think and I fell asleep instantly. Lidia, Rosa and I had been sitting on a flat area just out side the front door for nearly two hou rs, since eight o’clock in the morning. I had tried to steer them into a conve rsation but they had refused to talk. They seemed t o be very relaxed, almost asleep. Their mood of abandonm ent was not cont agious , how ever. Sitting there in that forced silence had put me into a mood of my ow n. Their hous e sat on top of a small hill; the fron t door faced the east. From where I sat I coul d see almost the entire narrow valley that ran from east to west. I coul d not see the tow n but I coul d see the green areas of cultivated fields on the floor of the valley. On the other side and flanki ng the valley in every direction, there were gigantic, rou nd, erode d hills. There were no high moun tains in the vicinity of the valley, onl y thos e enor mous , erode d, round hills, the sight of which created in me the most intense feeling of opp ression. I had the sensation that thos e hills were about to transpor t me to anot her time. Lidia spoke to me all of a sudde n and her voice disrupt ed my reverie. She pul led my sleeve. “Here com es Josefina,” she said. I looke d at the windi ng trail that led from the valley to the hous e. I saw a wom an walking slow ly up the trail, p erhaps fifty yards away. I not iced immediately the remarkable difference in age between Lidia and Rosa and the appr oaching wom an.

Judgi ng by her slow gait and the pos ture of her bod y, she seemed to be a wom an in her midfifties. She was thin, wore a long, dark skirt and was carrying a load of firewood on her back. She had a bundl e tied around her waist; it looke d as though she had a bundl edup child riding on her left hip. She seemed to be breastfeeding it as she walked. Her steps were almost feeble. She coul d barely make the last steep slope before reaching the hous e. When she finally stood in front of us, a few yards away, she was panting so heavily that I attempted to help her sit dow n. She made a gesture that seemed to say that she was all right . I heard Lidia and Rosa giggl ing. I did not look at them because my total attention had been taken by assault. The woman in front of me was absolutely the most disgus ting, foul creature I h ad ever seen. She unt ied the bundl e of firewoo d and droppe d it on the floo r with a loud clatter. I jum ped invol unt arily, due in part to the loud noi se and in part to the fact that the wom an nearly fell on my lap, pul led by the weight of the wood. She looke d at me for an instant and then low ered her eyes, seemingl y embarrassed by her clum siness. She straight ened her back and sighe d with appa rent relief. Obvi ously, the load had been too great for her old body. As she stretched her arms, her hair fell partiall y loos e. She was wearing a soiled headba nd tied ove r her forehead. Her hair was long and graying and seemed dirty and matted. I coul d see the white hairs against the dark brow n of the headba nd. She smiled at me and sort of nodde d her head. All her teeth se emed to be missing; I coul d see the black hol e of her toot hless mout h. She cove red her face with her hand and laughe d. She took off her sanda ls and walked into the hous e without giving me time to say anyt hing. Rosa follow ed her. I was dum bfounde d. Dona Sol edad had implied that Josefina was the same age as Lidia and Rosa. I turned to Lidia. She was peering at me. “I had no idea she was that old,” I said."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 “Yes, she’s pretty old,” she said in a matteroffact tone . “Does she have a child?” I asked. “Yes, and she takes him everyw here.

We thought that she shoul dn’ t have a child at her age. But she didn ’t pay any attention to us.” “Whos e child is he?” “Josefina’s, of cour se.” “I mean, who’ s the father?” “The Nagua l, who else?” I thought that that developm ent was qui te extravagant and very unne rving. “I suppos e anyt hing is pos sible in the Nagual’s world, ” I said. I meant it more as a thought to myself than a statement made to Lidia. “You bet,” she said, and laughe d. The oppr essiveness of thos e erode d hills became unbe arable. There was som ething truly abhor rent about that area, and Josefina had been the f inal blow . On top of having an ugl y, old, smelly body and no teeth, she also seemed to have som e sort of facial paralysis. The muscles on the left side of her face appe ared to be injured, a condi tion which created a most unpl easant distortion of her left e ye and the left side of her mout h. My oppr essive mood plum meted to one of sheer angui sh.

What a change , eh? And you your self have change d. You look more massive than I remember you. You are looki ng more and more like the Nagua l.” I wanted to say that the change in Josefina was abhor rent but I was afraid that she might ove rhear me. I looke d at the erode d hills across the valley. I felt like fleeing from them. “The Nagua l gave us this hous e,” she said, “but it is not a hous e for rest. We had anot her hous e before that was truly beautiful. This is a place to steam up. Tho se mount ains ove r there will drive you nut s.” Her bol dne ss in reading my feelings gave me a respite. I did not know what to say. “We are all naturally lazy,” she went on. “We don’ t like to strain our selves. The Nagua l kne w that, so he must have figured tha t this place woul d drive us up the walls.” She stood up abrupt ly and said that she wanted som ething to eat. We went to the kitchen, a semienclosed area with onl y two walls. At the ope n end, to the right of the door , there was an earthen stove ; at the other end, where the two walls met, there was a large dining area with a long table and three benches. The floor was paved with smoot h river rocks.

I became immersed in watching Lidia use a l adle to scoop the beans and meat. She seemed to have an eye for the exact amount . She must have been aware that I was adm iring her maneuve rs. She too k two or three beans from Rosa’s bow l and returned them to the pot . Out of the corner of my eye I saw Josef ina com ing into the kitchen. I did not look at her, though. She sat facing me across the table. I had a sque amish feeling in my stom ach. I felt that I coul d not eat with that wom an looki ng at me. To ease my tension I joke d with Lidia that there were still two extra beans in Rosa’s bow l that she had ove rlooke d. She scoope d up two beans with the ladle with a precision that made me gasp.

I finally and reluctantly had to look across the table at Josefina. There was a dead silence. I stared at her incredul ous ly. My mout h fell ope n. I heard the loud laught er of Lidia and Rosa. It took an endl ess mom ent for me to put my though ts and feelings in som e sort of order. Whoe ver was facing me was not the Josefina I had seen just awhile ago, but a very pretty girl. She did not have Indi an features as Lidia and Rosa did. She seemed to be more Latin than Indi an. She had a light olive com plexion, a very small mout h and a finely chiseled nos e, small white teeth and shor t, black, curly hair. She had a dimple on the left side of her face, which gave a definite cockiness to her smile. She was the girl I had met briefly years ago . She held my s crutiny. Her eyes were friendl y.

Josefina is very pretty and if she walks alone at night , no one will bot her her if she is ugl y a nd smelly, but if she goe s out as she really is, well, you your self can tell what woul d happe n.” Josefina nodde d affirmatively and then cont orted her face into the ugl iest grimace pos sible. “She can hol d that face all day,” Lidia said.

She doe sn’t write. She’s not you. She uses her hands and feet to tell us what she wants.” Josefina and Rosa came back to the kitchen. They stood by my side.

Rosa said to me that Josefina had conf ided that she wished she coul d talk, because she liked me very much. “Until you came she was happy the way she was,” Lidia said in a harsh voi ce. Josefina shook her head affirmatively, corrobor ating Lidia’s statement, and went into a mild out bu rst of sounds . “I wish la Gorda was here,” Rosa said. “Lidia always gets Josefina angr y.” “I don’ t mean to!” Lidia protested.

He had stressed that it was an extremely pow erful gesture, and that a warrior had to use it sparingl y. I had had very few occasions to perform it myself. The goodbye move ment la Gorda was executing was a variant of the one don Juan had taught me. He had said that the hands were clasped as in prayer, either gently or with great speed, even produc ing a clappi ng sound. Done either way, the pur pos e of clasping the hands was to imprison the feeling that the warrior did no t wish to leave behind. As soon as the hands had closed in and captured that feeling, they were taken with great force to the middl e of the chest, at the level of the heart.

I hur riedly got in the car. La Gorda got in after me, and as she did I coul d not help obs erving that she had entered the car as she woul d have entered a tunne l. She sort of crawled in. Don Juan used to do that. I joki ngl y said onc e, after I had seen him do it scores of times, that it was more func tiona l to get in the way I did. I thought that perhaps his lack of familiarity with automobi les was respons ible for his strange way of entering. He expl ained then that the car was a cave and that caves had to be entered in that fashion if we were goi ng to use them. There was an inhe rent spirit to caves, whether they were natural or manmade, and that that spirit had to be appr oached with respect. Crawling was the onl y way of show ing that respect. I was wonde ring whether or not to ask la Gorda if don Juan had instructed her about such details, but she spoke first. She said that the Nagua l had given her specific instructions about what to do in case I woul d survive the attacks of dona Soledad and the three girls. Then she casually adde d that before I headed for Mexico City we had to go to a specific place in the mount ai ns where don Juan and I used to go, and that there she woul d reveal all the information the Nagua l had never disclosed to me. I had a mom ent of inde cision, and then som ething in me which was not my reason made me head for the mount ains. We drove in com ple te silence. I attempted at various oppo rtune mom ents to start up a conve rsation, but she turned me dow n every time with a strong shake of her head.

We walked unt il we came to a small cave a few feet up the nor th side of the canyon, which ran from east to west. I used to spend a great deal of time there w ith don Juan. Before we entered the cave, la Gorda carefully swept the floor with branches, the way don Juan used to, in order to clear the ticks and parasites from the rocks. Then she cut a large heap of small branches with soft leaves from the surround in g bus hes and placed them on the rock floor like a mat. She motione d me to enter. I had always let don Juan enter first as a sign of respect. I wanted to do the same with her, but she declined. She said I was the Nagua l. I crawled into the cave the same way she had crawled into my car. I laughe d at my incons istency. I had never been able to treat my car as a cave. She coaxed me to relax and make myself com fortable. “The reason the Nagua l coul d not reveal all his designs to you was because you’ re incomplete,” la Gorda said all of a sudde n. “You still are, but now after your bout s with Soledad and the sisters, you are stronge r than before.” “What’s the meaning of being incom plete? Everyo ne has told me that you’ re the onl y one who can expl ain that,” I said. “It’ s a very simple matter,” she said. “A complete person is one who has never had children.” She paused as if she were allow ing me time to write dow n what she had said.

She giggl ed. “The Nagua l said t hat an incom plete person is one who has had children,” she said as if dictating to me. She scrutinized me, appa rently waiting for a que stion or a com ment. I had none . “Now I’ve told you everything about being com plete and incom plete,” she said. “And I’ve t old you just like the Nagua l told me. It didn’ t mean anyt hing to me at that time, and it doe sn’t mean anyt hing to you now .” I had to laugh at the way she patterned herself after don Juan. “An incom plete person has a hol e in the stomach,” she went on. “A so rcerer can see it as plainly as you can see my head. When the hol e is on the left side of one ’s stom ach, the child who created that hol e is of the same sex. If it is on the right side, the child is of the oppos ite sex. The hol e on the left side is black, the one on the right is dark brow n.” “Can you see that hol e in anyone who has had children?” “Sure. There are two ways of seeing it. A sorcerer may see it in dreaming or by looki ng directly at a person.

None theless, what she had said was the truth. Don Juan’s words always had had a doubl e ef fect on me: onc e when I heard for the first time whatever he had said, and then when I read at hom e whatever I had written dow n and had forgot ten abou t. Talking to la Gorda, how ever, was intrinsically different. Don Juan’s appr entices were not in any way as engul fing as he was. Their revelations , although extraordinary, were onl y missing pieces to a jigsaw puz zle. The unus ual character of thos e pieces was that with them the picture did not becom e clearer but that it became more and more com plex. “You had a brow n hol e in the right side of your stom ach,” she cont inue d. “That means that a wom an emptied you. You made a female child. “The Nagua l said that I had a huge black hole myself, because I made two wom en. I never saw the hol e, but I’ve seen other peopl e w ith hol es like mine.” “You said that I had a hol e; don’ t I have it anym ore?” “No. It’s been patched. The Nagua l helped you to patch it. Without his help you woul d be more empty than you are no w.” “What kind of patch is it?” “A patch in your lum inos ity. Th ere is no other way of saying it. The Nagua l said that a sorcerer like himself can fill up the hol e anyt ime. But that that filling is onl y a patch without lum inos ity. Anyone who sees or doe s dreaming can tell that it looks like a lead patch on the yellow l um inos ity of the rest of the body. “The Nagua l patched you and me and Soledad. But then he left it up to us to put back the shine, the lum inos ity.” “How did he patch us?” “He’s a sorcerer, he put things in our bodi es. He replaced us. We are no longe r the s ame.

Except Soledad; she’s som ething else.” La Gorda seemed unw illing to go on. She vacillated and almost began to stutter. “What is dona Soledad?” I insisted. “It’s very ha rd to tell,” she said after cons iderable coaxing. “She is the same as you and me, and yet she’s different. She has the same lum inos ity, but she’s not toge ther with us. She goe s in the oppos ite direction. Right now she’s more like you. Both of you have pat ches that look like lead. Mine is gone and I’m again a com plete, lum inous egg. That is the reason I said that you and I will be exactly the same som eday when you becom e com plete again. Right now what makes us almost the same is the Nagua l’s lum inos ity and the fact that bot h of us are goi ng in the same direction and that we bot h were empty.” “What doe s a com plete person look like to a sorcerer?” I asked. “Like a lum inous egg made out of fibers,” she said. “All the fibers are com plete; they look like strings , taut strings . It looks as if the strings have been tight ened like a drum is tight ened. “On an empty person, on the other hand, the fibers are crum pled up at the edge s of the hol e. When they have had many children, the fibers don’ t loo k like fibers anym ore . Thos e peopl e look like two chunks of lum inos ity, separated by blackne ss. It is an awesom e sight . The Nagua l made me see them one day when we were in a park in the city.” “Why do you think the Nagua l never told me about all this?” “He told you everything, but you never und erstood him correctly.

As I began to talk about that litt le boy, a wave of nos talgia enve lope d me; perhaps it was the place or the situation or the time of the day. Som ehow I had merged the memory of that little boy with the memory of don Juan, and for the first time in all the time I had not seen him I missed d on Juan. Lidia had said that they never missed him because he was always with them; he was their bodi es and their spirits. I had know n instantly what she meant. I felt the same way myself. In that gul ly, how ever, an unknow n feeling had ov ertaken me. I told la Gorda that I had never missed don Juan unt il that mom ent. She did not answer. She looke d away.

I said to la Gorda that that little boy had been, more than anyt hing else, my friend, and that one day he was whisked away by forces I coul d not cont rol. That was perhaps one of the great est blow s I had ever received. I even went to see don Juan to ask his assistance. It was the onl y time I had ever asked him for help. He listened to my plea and then he broke into upr oarious laught er. His reaction was so une xpe cted that I coul d not even g et angr y.

I said that since he was a sorcerer perhaps he coul d help me to regain my little friend for my solace. “You’ re wrong. A warrior doe sn’t seek anyt hing for his solace,” he said in a tone that did not adm it reproach."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 Then he proceeded to smash my argum ents. He said that a warrior coul d not pos sibly leave anyt hing to chance, that a warrior actually affected the out com e of events by the force of his awa reness and his unbe ndi ng intent. He said that if I woul d have had the unbe ndi ng intent to keep and help that child, I woul d have taken measures to assure his stay with me. But as it was, my love was merely a word, a useless out bur st of an empty man. He th en told me som ething about emptiness and com pleteness, but I did not want to hear it. All I felt was a sense of loss, and the emptiness that he had mentione d, I was sure, referred to the feeling of having lost som eone irreplaceable. “You love d him, you hon ored his spirit, yo u wished him well, now you must forget him,” he said. But I had not been able to do so. There was som ething terribly alive in my emotions even though time had mellow ed them. At one poi nt I thought I had forgo tten, but then one night an i ncident produc ed the deepest emotiona l uphe aval in me. I was walking to my office when a young Mexican wom an appr oached me.

I left them there and gave the mother enough mone y to pay the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 bill. But I did not want to stay or to know any more about him. I wanted to believe that I had helped him, and that by doi ng so I had paid back to the spirit of man. I had learned the magical act of “paying back to the spirit of man” from don Juan. I had asked him onc e, ove rwhelmed by the real ization that I coul d never pay him back for all he had done for me, if there was anyt hing in the world I coul d do to even the score. We were leaving a bank, after exchangi ng som e Mexican currency. “I don’ t need you to pay me back,” he said, “but if you sti ll want to pay back, make your depos it to the spirit of man. That’s always a very small account , and whatever one put s in it is more than enough. ” By helping that sick child I had merely paid back to the spirit of man for any help that my little boy may r eceive from strange rs along his path.

I tried to go back to the hous e, but it was useless. I coul dn’ t break the force of the wind. It pus hed me ove r the hills and off the road and I ende d up in a deep hol e, a hol e like a tom b. The wind kept me there for days and days, unt il I h ad decided to change and accept my fate without recrimination. Then the wind stoppe d and the Nagua l foun d me and took me back to the hous e. He told me that my task was to give what I didn’ t have, love and affection, and that I had to take care of the siste rs, Lidia and Josefina, better than if they were myself.

That first night he found me, the moths had poi nted me out to him; I had no bus iness rebelling against my fate. I began my change by taking care of Lidia and Josefina better than I took care of myself. I did everything the Nagua l told me, and one night in this very gul ly in this very cave I found my com pleteness. I had fallen asleep right here where I am now and then a noi se woke me up. I looke d up and saw myself as I had onc e been, thin, young, fresh. It was my spirit that was c om ing back to me. At first it didn’ t want to com e closer because I still looke d pretty awful. But then it coul dn’ t help itself and came to me. I kne w right then, and all at onc e, what the Nagua l had struggl ed for years to tell me. He had said that when one has a child that child takes the edge of our spirit. For a wom an to have a girl means the end of that edge . To have had two as I did meant the end of me. The best of my strengt h and my illusions went to thos e girls. They stole my edge , the Nagua l said, i n the same way I had stolen it from my parents. That’s our fate. A boy steals the bigge st part of his edge from his father, a girl from her mother. The Nagua l said that peopl e who have had children coul d tell, if they aren’t as stubbor n as you, that som eth ing is missing in them. Som e craziness, som e nervous ness, som e pow er that they had before is gone . They used to have it, but where is it now ? The Nagua l said that it is in the little child runni ng arou nd the hous e, full of energy, full of illusions . In ot her words, com plete. He said that if we watch children we can tell that they are daring, they move in leaps. If we watch their parents we can see that they are cautious and timid. They don’ t leap anym ore. The Nagua l told me we expl ain that by saying that t he parents are grow nups and have respons ibilities. But that’s not true. The truth of the matter is that they have lost their edge .” I asked la Gorda what the Nagua l woul d have said if I had told him that I kne w parents with much more spirit and edge than t heir children."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 She laughe d, cove ring her face in a gesture of sham embarrassment. “You can ask me,” she said giggl ing. “You want to hear what I think? ” “Of cour se I want to hear it.” “Thos e peopl e don’ t have more spirit, they merely had a lot of vigor to b egin with and have trained their children to be obe dient and meek. They have fright ened their children all their lives, that’s all.” I described to her the case of a man I kne w, a father of four , who at the age of fiftythree change d his life com pletely. Th at entailed leaving his wife and his executive job in a large corpor ation after more than twentyfive years of bui lding a career and a family. He chuc ked it all very daringl y and went to live on an island in the Pacific. “You mean he went there all by himse lf?” la Gorda asked with a tone of surprise. She had destroye d my argum ent. I had to adm it that the man had gone there with his twentythreeyearold bride. “Who no doubt is com plete,” la Gorda adde d. I had to agree with her again. “An empty man uses the com p leteness of a wom an all the time,” she went on. “A com plete wom an is dange rous in her com pleteness, more so than a man. She is unr eliable, moody, nervous , but also capable of great change s. Wom en like that can pick themselves up and go anyw here. They’ll do not hing there, but that’s because they had not hing goi ng to begin with. Empty peopl e, on the other hand, can’t jum p like that anym ore, but they’re more reliable. The Nagua l said that empty peopl e are like worms that look around before movi ng a bit and th en they back up and then they move a little bit more again.

Man or wom an, they must be com plete to enter into that world out there, that eternity where the Nag ual and Genaro are now waiting for us.” She stoppe d talking and stared at me for a long mom ent.

At that time don Juan had said that fleeing was useless and the onl y thing one coul d do was to remain on the spot in the pos ition la Gorda had just prescribed.

I asked her to hol d the tips above my head, climb to my shoul ders and stand on them, bracing herself by p ulling up the ends of the shawl and fastening it like a harness.

The interesting part, how ever, was that the rectangul ar shape was no longe r in sight . Our strategy had worked. La Gorda sugge sted that she carry me on her shoul ders for a stretch. I found the idea ludi crous ; my weight was more than what her small frame coul d stand. We decided to walk for a while and see what happe ned. There was a dead silence around us. We walked slow ly, bracing each other. We had move d no more than a few yards when I again began to hear strange breathing noi ses, a soft, prolonge d hissing like the hissing of a feline. I hur riedly helped her to get back on my shoul ders and walked anot her ten paces. I kne w we had to maintain the une xpe cted as a tactic if we wanted to get out of that place. I was trying to figur e out anot her set of une xpe cted actions we coul d use i nstead of la Gorda standi ng on my shoul ders, when she took off her long dress. In one singl e move ment she was naked. She scrambled on the ground looki ng for som ething. I heard a cracking sound and she stood up hol ding a branch from a low bus h. She manoe uv red her shawl around my shoul ders and neck and made a sort of riding suppor t where she coul d sit with her legs wrappe d around my waist, like a child riding piggyba ck. She then put the branch inside her dress and held it above her head. She began to twirl t he branch, giving the dress a strange"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 bounc e. To that effect she adde d a whistle, imitating the peculiar cry of a night ow l. After a hundr ed yards or so I heard the same sounds com ing from behind us and from the sides. She change d to anot her birdcall, a pi ercing sound similar to that made by a peacock. A few minut es later the same birdcalls were echoi ng all around us. I had witnessed a similar phe nom enon of birdcalls being answered, years before with don Juan. I had thought at the time that perhaps the sou nds were being produc ed by don Juan who was hiding nearby in the darkne ss, or even by som eone closely associated with him, such as don Genaro, who was aiding him in creating an insurmount able fear in me, a fear that made me run in total darkne ss without ev en stum bling. Don Juan had called that particular action of runni ng in darkne ss the gait of pow er. I asked la Gorda if she kne w how to do the gait of pow er. She said yes. I told her that we were goi ng to try it, even though I was not at all sure I coul d do it. She said that it was neither the time nor the place for that and poi nted in fron t of us. My heart, which had been beating fast all along, began to pound wildly inside my chest. Right ahead of us, perhaps ten feet away, and smack in the middl e of the trail was one of don Genaro’s allies, the strange glow ing man, with the long face and the bald head. I froze on the spot . I heard la Gorda’s shriek as though it were com ing from far away. She frantically poun ded on my sides with her fists. Her action brok e my fixation on the man. She turned my head to the left and then to the right . On my left side, almost touc hing my leg, was the black mass of a giant feline with glaring yellow eyes. To my right I saw an enor mous phos phor escent coyot e. Behind us, almost t ouc hing la Gorda’s back, was the dark rectangul ar shape. The man turned his back to us and began to move on the trail. I also began to walk. La Gorda kept on shrieking and whining. The rectangul ar shape was almost"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 grabbi ng her back. I heard it movi ng with crushing thum ps. The sound of its steps reverberated on the hills arou nd us. I coul d feel its cold breath on my neck. I kne w that la Gorda was about to go mad. And so was 1. The feline and the coyot e were almost rubbi ng my legs. I coul d hear their hissing and grow ling increasing in vol um e. I had, at that mom ent, the irrationa l urge to make a certain sound don Juan had taught me. The allies answered me. I kept on frantically making the sound and they answered me back. The tension diminished by degrees, and before we reached the road I was part of a most extravagant scene. La Gorda was riding piggyba ck, happi ly bounc ing her dress ove r her head as if not hing had ever happe ned, keeping the bounc es in rhyt hm with the sound I was making, while four creatures of a not her world answered me back as they move d at my pace, flanki ng us on all four sides. We got to the road in that fashion. But I did not want to leave. There seemed to be som ething missing. I stayed motionl ess with la Gorda on my back and made a very speci al tappi ng sound don Juan had taught me. He had said that it was the call of moths. In order to prod uce it one had to use the inside edge of the left hand and the lips. As soon as I made it everything seemed to com e to rest peacefully. The four entities an swered me, and as they did I kne w which were the one s that woul d go with me. I then walked to the car and eased la Gorda off my back ont o the driver’s seat and pus hed her ove r to her side. We drove away in absolute silence. Som ething had touc hed me som ewhe re and my thought s had been turned off. La Gorda sugge sted that we go to don Genaro’s place instead of driving to her hous e. She said that Benigno, Nestor ami Pablito lived there but they were out of tow n. Her sugge stion appe aled to me."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 Once we were in the hous e la Gorda lit a lantern. The place looke d just as it had the last time I had visited don Genaro. We sat on the floor . I pul led up a bench and put my writing pad on it. I was not tired and I wanted to write but I coul d not do it. I coul d not write at all. “What did the Nagua l tell you about the allies?” I asked. My que stion seemed to catch her off gua rd. She did not know how to answer. “I can’t think, ” she finally said. It was as though she had never expe rienced that state before. She paced back and f orth in front of me. Tiny beads of perspiration had formed on the tip of her nos e and on her uppe r lip. She sudde nly grabbe d me by the hand and practically pul led me out of the hous e. She led me to a nearby ravine and there she got sick. My stom ach felt qu easy. She said that the pul l of the allies had been too great and that I shoul d force myself to throw up. I stared at her, waiting for a further expl anation. She took my head in her hands and stuck her finge r dow n my throat, with the certainty of a nur se dealing with a child, and actually made me vom it. She expl ained that hum an beings had a very delicate glow around the stom ach and that that glow was always being pul led by everything around. At times when the pul l was too great, as in the case of cont act w ith the allies, or even in the case of cont act with strong peopl e, the glow woul d becom e agitated, change color or even fade altoge ther. In such instances the onl y thing one coul d do was simply to throw up. I felt better but not qui te myself yet. I had a sense of tiredne ss, of heaviness around my eyes. We walked back to the hous e. As we reached the door la Gorda sniffed the air like a dog and said that she knew which allies were mine. Her statement, which ordinarily woul d have had no other signi ficance tha n the one she"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 allude d to, or the one I myself read into it, had the special qua lity of a cathartic device. It made me expl ode into thought s. All at onc e, my usual intellectual deliberations came into being. I felt myself leaping in the air, as if thought s had an energy of their ow n. The first tho ught that came to my mind was that the allies were actual entities, as I had suspected without ever daring to adm it it, even to myself. I had seen them and felt them and com muni cated with them. I was euphor ic. I emb raced la Gorda and began to expl ain to her the crux of my intellectual dilemma. I had seen the allies without the aid of don Juan or don Genaro and that act made all the difference in the world to me. I told la Gorda that onc e when I had repor ted to don Ju an that I had seen one of the allies he had laughe d and urged me not to take myself so serious ly and to disregard what I had seen. I had never wanted to believe I was having hallucinations , but I did not want to accept that there were allies, either. My ra tiona l backgr oun d was unbe ndi ng. I coul d not bridge the gap. This time, how ever, everything was different, and the thought that there were actually beings on this earth that were from anot her world without being aliens to the earth was more than I coul d be ar. I said to la Gorda, half in jest, that secretly I woul d have given anyt hing to be crazy. That woul d have absolved som e part of me from the crushing respons ibility of revamping my unde rstandi ng of the world. The iron y of it was that I coul d not have bee n more willing to revamp my unde rstandi ng of the world, on an intellectual level, that is. But that was not enough. That had never been enough. And that had been my insurmou ntable obs tacle all along, my deadly flaw. I had been willing to dally in don Juan ’s world in a semiconvi nced fashion; therefore, I had been a qua sisorcerer. All my efforts had been no more than my inane eagerness to fence with the intellect, as if I were in academia where one can do that very thing from 8: 00 a. m. to 5: 00 p. m., at w hich time, dul y tired, one goe s hom e.

She clow ned, the way don Genaro used to, imitating the gestures I made while I wrote. “What do you know about the allies, Gorda?” I asked. “O nly what the Nagua l told me,” she replied. “He said that the allies were forces that a sorcerer learns to cont rol. He had two inside his gour d and so did Genaro.” “How did they keep them inside their gour ds?” “No one know s that. All the Nagua l kne w was tha t a tiny, perfect gour d with a neck must be found before one coul d harness the allies.” “Where can one find that kind of gour d?” “Anyw here. The Nagua l left word with me, in case we survived the attack of the allies, that we shoul d start looki ng for the per fect gour d, which must be the size of the thum b of the left hand. That was the size of the Nagua l’s gour d.” “Have you seen his gour d?” “No. Never. The Nagua l said that a gour d of that kind is not in the world of men.

In fact, I woul d have steppe d out to see the jagua r had la Gorda n ot stoppe d me. “You’ re still incomplete,” she said. “The allies woul d feast on you if you go out by your self.

She patted my back and held me dow n against the bench on which I was writing. “You’ re not a com plete sorcerer yet,” she said. “You have a huge patch in your midd le and the force of thos e allies woul d yank it out of place. They are no joke .” “What are you suppos ed to do when an ally com es to you in this fashion? ” “I don’ t bot her with them one way or anot her.

I realized at that mom ent that I had autom atically assum ed that she had seen the same things I had. I described in great detail the four allies as I had seen them. She listened more than a ttentively; she appe ared to be spellbound by my description. “The allies have no form,” she said when I had finished. “They are like a presence, like a wind, like a glow . The first one we found toni ght was a blackne ss that wanted to get inside my body. Th at’s why I screamed. I felt it reaching up my legs. The others were just colors. Their glow was so strong, though, that it made the trail look as if it were daytime.” Her statements astounde d me.

An ally is onl y a presence, a helper that is nothing an d yet it is as real as you and me.” “Have the little sisters seen the allies?” “Everyb ody has seen them one time or anot her.” “Are the allies just a force for them too? ” “No. They are like you; they haven’t lost their hum an form yet. None of them has. For all of them, the little sisters, the Genaros and Soledad, the allies are hor rend ous things ; with them the allies are malevol ent, dreadful creatures of the night . The sole mention of the allies sends Lidia and Josefina and Pablito into a frenzy. Rosa and Ne stor are not that afraid of them, but they don’ t want to have anyt hing to do with them, either.

He described the mold as being the sour ce, the origin of man, since, without the mold to group t oge ther the force of life, there was no way for that force to assemble itself into the shape of man. He interpreted my dream as a brief and extraordinarily simplistic glance at the mold. He said that my dream had restated the fact that I was a simpleminde d and very earthy man. La Gorda laughe d and said that she woul d have said the same thing herself. To see the mold as an average naked man and then as an animal had been inde ed a very simplistic view view of the mold. “Perhaps it was just a stupi d, ordinary dream,” I said, trying to defend myself. “No,” she said with a large grin. “You see, the hum an mold glow s and it is always found in water hol es and narrow gul lies.” “Why in gul lies and water hol es?” I asked. “It feeds on water. Without water there is no mo ld,” she replied. “I know that the Nagua l took you to water hol es regul arly in hope s of show ing yon the mold. But your emptiness prevented you from seeing anyt hing.

The Nagua l said that som etimes if we have enough persona l pow er we can catch a glimpse of the mold even though we are no t sorcerers; when that happe ns we say that we have seen God. He said that if we call it God it is the trut h. The mold is God. “I had a dreadful time unde rstandi ng the Nagua l, because I was a very religious wom an.

I never found anyt hing in my dreams. The Nagua l was merciless with me. He said that I had to find them or peri sh. So I lied to him that I had found my hands in my dreams. The Nagua l didn’ t say a word but Genaro threw his hat on the floor and danced on it. He patted my head and said that I was really a great warrior. The more he praised me the worse I felt. I was a bout to tell the Nagua l the truth when crazy Genaro aimed his behind at me and let out the loude st and longe st fart I had ever heard. He actually pus hed me backw ard with it. It was like a hot , foul wind, disgus ting and smelly, just like me. The Nagua l was choki ng with laught er. “I ran to the hous e and hid there. I was very fat then. I used to eat a great deal and I had a lot of gas. So I decided not to eat for a while. Lidia and Josefina helped me. I didn’ t eat anyt hing for twentythree days, and then one ni ght I found my hands in my dreams. They were old and ugl y and green, but they were mine. So that was the beginni ng. The rest was easy.” “And what was the rest, Gorda?” “The next thing the Nagua l wanted me to do was to try to find hous es or bui ldings in my dreams and look at them, trying not to dissolve the images. He said that the art of the dreamer is to hol d the image of his dream. Because that’s what we do anyw ay dur ing all our lives.” “What did he mean by that?” “Our art as ordinary peopl e is that we kn ow how to hol d the image of what we are looki ng at. The Nagua l said that we do that but we don’ t know how . We just do it; that is, our bodi es do it. In dreaming we have to do the same thing, except that in dreaming we have to learn how to do it. We have to struggl e not to look but merely to glance and yet hol d the image. “The Nagua l told me to find in my dreams a brace for my belly but ton. It took a long time because I didn’ t unde rstand what he meant. He said that in"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 dreaming we pay attention with the belly but ton; therefore it has to be protected. We need a little warmth or a feeling that som ething is pressing the belly but ton in order to hol d the images in our dreams. “I found a pebbl e in my dreams that fit my belly but ton, and the Nagua l made me look for it day after day in water hol es and canyons , unt il I found it. I made a belt for it and I still wear it day and night . Wearing it made it easier for me to hol d images in my dreams. “Then the Nagua l gave me the task of goi ng to specific places in my dreamin g. I was doi ng really well with my task but at that time I lost my form and I began to see the eye in front of me. The Nagua l said that the eye had change d everything, and he gave me orders to begin using the eye to pul l myself away. He said that I didn’ t have time to get to my do ubl e in dreaming, but that the eye was even better. I felt cheated. Now I don’ t care. I’ve used that eye the best way I coul d. I let it pul l me in my dreaming. I close my eyes and fall asleep like not hing, even in the daytime or an yw here. The eye pul ls me and I enter into anot her world. Most of the time I just wande r around in it. The Nagua l told me and the little sisters that dur ing our menstrual periods dreaming becom es pow er. I get a little crazy for one thing. I becom e more dari ng. And like the Nagua l show ed us, a crack ope ns in front of us dur ing thos e days. You’ re not a wom an so it can’t make any sense to you, but two days before her period a wom an can ope n that crack and step through it into anot her world.” With her left hand she follow ed the cont ou r of an invi sible line that seemed to run vertically in front of her at arm’s length. “During that time a wom an, if she wants to, can let go of the images of the world,” la Gorda went on. “That’s the crack between the worlds, and as the Nagua l said, it is right in front of all of us wom en."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 162 “The reason the Nagua l believes wom en are better sorcerers than men is because they always have the crack in front of them, while a man has to make it. “Well, it was dur ing my periods that I learne d in dreaming to fly with the lines of the world. I learned to make sparks with my body to entice the lines and then I learned to grab them. And that’s all I have learned in dreaming so far.” I laughe d and told her that I had not hing to show for my years o f “dreaming. ” “You’ ve learned how to call the allies in dreaming, ” she said with great assurance.

What did you see?” “As far as I’m conc erned I had no visions , or if I did I coul dn ’t pay any attention to them. My lack of impeccability makes it impos sible for me to remember them.” “And then what happe ned?” “I woke up at Genaro’s old place. I don’ t know how I got there.” He remained qui et, while I frant ically searched in my mind for a que stion, a com ment, a critical statement or anyt hing that woul d add extra breadth to his statements. As it was, not hing in Pablito’s account was usable to but tress what had happe ned to me. I felt cheated. I was almost angr y with him. My feelings were a mixture of pity for Pablito and myself and at the same time a most intense disappoi ntment. “I’m sorry I’m such a letdow n to you, ” Pablito said."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 176 My immediate reaction to his words was to cove r up my feelings and assure him th at I was not disappoi nted at all. “I am a sorcerer,” he said, laughi ng, “a poor one , but enough of a one to know what my body tells me. And right no w it tells me that you are angr y with me.” “I’m not angr y, Pablito!” I exclaimed. “That’s what your reason s ays, but not your body, ” he said. “Your body is angr y. Your reason, how ever, finds no reason to feel ange r tow ard me, so you’ re caught in a cross fire. The least I can do for you is to unt angl e this. Your body is angr y because it know s that I am not impec cable and that onl y an impeccable warrior can help you. Your body is angr y because it feels that I am wasting myself. It kne w all that the minut e I walked throug h that door .” I did not know what to say. I felt a flood of pos tfact realizations . Perhaps he w as right in saying that my body kne w all that. At any rate, his directness in conf ron ting me with my feelings had blunt ed the edge of my frustration. I began to wonde r if Pablito was not just playing a game with me. I told him that being so direct and bol d he coul d not pos sibly be as weak as he pictured himself to be. “My weakne ss is that I’m made to have longi ngs ,” he said almost in a whisper. “I’m even to the poi nt where I lon g for my life as an ordinary man. Can you believe that?” “You can’t be serious , Pablito! “ I exclaimed. “I am,” he replied. “I long for the grand privilege of walking the face of the earth as an ordinary man, without this awesom e bur den.” I found his stand simply prepos terous and caught myself exclaiming ove r and ove r that he coul d no t pos sibly be serious . Pablito looke d at me and sighe d. I was ove rtaken by a sudde n appr ehension. He seemed to be on the verge of tears."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 177 My appr ehension gave way to an intense feeling of empathy. Neither of us coul d help each other.

One of the features that I had always adm ired was his nimbleness; even when he stom ped his feet his move ments h ad grace. He sudde nly reached across the table and nearly snatched my writing pad away from me. He grabbe d it with the thum b and inde x finge r of his left hand.

He let go, and as he retrieved his hand I saw a fleeting image of an extension to it. It happ ened so fast that I coul d have expl ained it as a visual d istortion on my part, a produc t of the jolt of having to stand up halfway, drawn by the force of his pul l.

Pablito began to choke . His face became almost pur ple. La Gorda told him in a nonc halant tone to cut out the acting because he had no audi ence; she was leaving and I did not have much patience. She then turned to me and told me in a most com mandi ng tone to stay there and not go to the Genaros’ hous e. “Why in the hell not ?” Pablito yelled and jum ped in fron t of her as if trying to stop her from leaving. “What gall!

Thos e t wo foxe s were really sly. They were in no hur ry. Genaro said that he woul d’ve waited for me if it took him twenty years. That’s why the Nagua l went to work for me.

Genaro said that his friend was not hing without his conc oction, and to prove it to me he didn’ t give it to him for two days.

The Nestor who was looki ng at me was a mixture of don Juan and don Genaro. He was wiry and agile like don Genaro, but had the mesmeric com mand that don Juan had.

I had not realize d unt il then that they had turned to me after they had said goodb ye to you two, and as you were runni ng to the edge they waved their hands and said goodbye to me. “Findi ng myself alone at that time of day, on that deserted spot , was more than I coul d bear. In one sweep I had lost all the friends I had in the world. I sat dow n and wept. And as I got more and more scared I began to scream as loud as I coul d. I called Genaro’s name at the top of my voi ce. By then it was pitchbl ack. I coul d no longe r disting ui sh any landm arks. I kne w that as a warrior I had no bus iness indul ging in my grief.

I f orgot that the world existed. The more I how led the easier it was to feel the warmth and protection of the earth. “Hour s must have passed. Sudde nly I felt a blow inside of me, behind my throat, and the sound of a bell in my cars. I remembered what the Nagu al had told Eligio and Benigno before they jum ped. He said that the feeling in the throat came just before one was ready to change speed, and that the sound of the bell was the vehicle that one coul d use to accom plish anything that one needed.

It didn’ t matter to me to have turned into a coyot e, or to be dead, or to be alive. I walked like a coyot e, on four legs, to the edge of the precipice and leaped into it. There was not hing else for me to do. “I felt that I was falling dow n and my coyot e body turned in the air. Then I was myself again twirling in midair. But before I hit the bot tom I became so light that I didn’ t fall anym ore bu t floated. The air went throug h me. I was so light ! I believed that my death was finally com ing inside me.

That’s all I can say about it. Then, qui te sudde nly, the same thing that had made me like dry sand put me toge ther again. I came back to life and I found myself sitting in the hut of an old Mazatec sorcerer. He told me his name was Por firio. He said that he was glad to see me and began to teach me certain things about plants that Genaro hadn’ t taught me. He took me with him to where the plants were being made and show ed me the mold of plants, especially the marks on the molds.

I had to expl ain to them at great lengt h that it was impos sible that a structure of that magni tude coul d exist on our planet.

In the early evening la Gorda and I sat in the di ning area alone . We were silent for a while. I was very tired. La Gorda broke the silence and said that all of them had been too com placent since the Nagua l and Genaro had left. Each of them had been absorbed in his or her particular tasks. She said that the Nagua l had com mande d her to be an impassiona te warrior and to follow whatever path her fate selected for her. If Soledad had stolen my pow er, la Gorda had to flee and try to save the little sisters and then join Benigno and Nestor, the onl y two Genaro s who woul d have survived. If the little sisters had killed me, she had to join the Genaros because the little sisters woul d have had no more need to be with her. If I had not survived the attack of the allies and she did, she had to leave that area and be on her ow n. She told me, with a glint in her eye, that she had been sure that neither one of us woul d survive, and that that was why she had said goodbye to her sisters, to her hous e and to the hills. “The Nagua l told me that in case you and I survived th e allies,” she went on, “I have to do anyt hing for you, because that woul d be my warrior’s path. That was why I interfered with what Benigno was doi ng to you last night . He was pressing on your chest with his eyes. That is his art as a stalker.

I wanted her to elucidate her statements. I paused for a mom ent to read what I had written in order to select the most appr opr iate que stion. I told her that I first wanted to find out what she kne w about my doubl e and then I wanted to kno w about the art of stalking. “The Nagua l told me that your dou ble is som ething that takes a lot of pow er to com e out ,” she said. “He figur ed that yo u might have enough energy to get it out of you twice. That’s why he set up Soled ad and the little sisters either to kill you or to help you. ” La Gorda said that I had had more energy than the Nagua l thought , and that my doubl e came out three times. Appa rently Rosa’s attack had not been a thought less action; on the cont rary, she had ve ry cleverly calculated that if she injured me, I woul d have been helpless: the same ploy dona Soledad had tried with her dog. I had given Rosa a chance to strike me when I yelled at her, but she failed to injure me. My doubl e came out and injured her inste ad. La Gorda said that Lidia had told her that Rosa did not want to wake up when all of us had to rush out of Soledad’s hous e, so Lidia sque ezed the hand that had been injured. Rosa did not feel any pain and kne w in an instant that I had cured her, which m eant to them that I had drained my pow er.

As soon as Rosa realized that I had also cured her, sh e thought that I had weakened myself beyond repair.

It came out of your body and it was your nagua l. By touc hing it, you pul led it back.” La Gorda told me then, as though she were unve iling a mystery, that the Nagua l had com mande d her not to disclose the fact that since all of us had the same lum inos ity, if my nagua l touc hed one of them, I woul d not get weakened, as woul d ordinarily be the case if my nagua l touc hed an average man. “If your nagua l touc h es us,” she said, giving me a gentle slap on the head, “your lum inos ity stays on the surface. You can pick it up again and not hing is lost.” I told her that the cont ent of her expl anation was impos sible for me to believe.

She carefully expl ained that there was no oppos ition, that my statement was correct, the tona l was also in ev erything.

She adde d that we coul d stum ble upon the most out landi sh sight s o f the tona l and be scared of them, or awed by them, or be indi fferent to them, because all of us coul d view thos e sight s. A sight of the nagua l, on the other hand, needed the specialized senses of a sorcerer in order to be seen at all. And yet, bot h the to nal and the nagua l were present in everything at all times. It was appr opr iate, therefore, for a sorcerer to say that “looki ng” cons isted in viewing the tona l which is in everything, and “seeing, ” on the other hand, cons isted in viewing the nagua l which al so is in everything. Accordingl y, if a warrior obs erved the world as a hum an being, he was looki ng, but if he obs erved it as a sorcerer, he was “seeing, ” and what he was “seeing” had to be prope rly called the nagua l. She then reiterated the reason, which N estor had given me earlier, for calling don Juan the Nagua l and conf irmed that I was also the Nagua l because of the shape that came out of my head. I wanted to know why they had called the shape that had com e out of my head the doubl e. She said that they h ad thought they were sharing a private joke with me.

It might have been Pablito or me or anyo ne.” “Tell me now , what is the art of stalking? ” I asked. “The Nagua l was a stalker,” she said, and peered at me. “You must know that. He taught you to stalk from the beginn ing. ” It occurred to me that what she was referring to was what don Juan had called the hunt er. He had certainly taught me to be a hunt er. I told her that don Juan had sho wn me how to hunt and make traps. Her usage of the term stalker, how ever, was more accurate. “A hunt er just hunt s,” she said. “A stalker stalks anyt hing, includi ng himself.” “How doe s he do that?” “An impeccable stalker can turn anyt hing into prey. The Nag ual told me that we can even stalk our ow n weakne sses.” I stoppe d writing and tried to remember if don Juan had ever presented me with such a nove l pos sibility: to stalk my weakne sses. I coul d not recall him ever put ting it in thos e terms. “How can one sta lk one ’s weakne sses, Gorda?” “The same way you stalk prey. You figur e out your rou tines unt il you know all the doi ng of your weakne sses and then you com e upon them and pick them up like rabbi ts inside a cage.” Don Juan had taught me the same thing about ro utines, but in the vein of a general principle that hunt ers must be aware of. Her unde rstandi ng and appl ication of it, how ever, were more pragm atic than mine. Don Juan had said that any habit was, in essence, a “doi ng, “and that a doi ng needed all its part s in order to func tion. If som e parts were missing, a doi ng was"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 223 disassembled. By doi ng, he meant any cohe rent and meaningf ul series of actions . In other words, a habit needed all its com pone nt actions in order to be a live activity. La Gorda then described how she had stalked her ow n weakne ss of eating excessively. She said that the Nagua l had sugge sted she first tackle the bigge st part of that habit, which was conne cted with her laundr y work; she ate whatever her custom ers fed her as she went from hous e to hous e delivering her wash. She expe cted the Nagua l to tell her what to do, but he onl y laughe d and made fun of her, saying that as soon as he woul d mention som ething for her to do, she woul d fight not to do it. He said that that was the way hum an beings a re; they love to be told what to do, but they love even more to fight and not do what they are told, and thus they get entangl ed in hating the one who told them in the first place. For many years she coul d not think of anyt hing to do to stalk her weakne ss. One day, how ever, she got so sick and tired of being fat that she refused to eat for twentythree days. That was the initial action that broke her fixation. She then had the idea of stuffing her mouth with a spong e to make her custom ers believe that she h ad an infected toot h and coul d not eat. The subt erfuge worked not onl y with her custom ers, who stoppe d giving her foo d, but with her as well, as she had the feeling of eating as she chewed on the sponge . La Gorda laughe d when she told me how she had walked around with a sponge stuffed in her mout h for years unt il her habit of eating excessively had been broke n. “Was that all you needed to stop your habit?” I asked. “No. I also had to learn how to eat like a warrior.” “And how doe s a warrior eat?” “A warrior eats qui etly, and slow ly, and very little at a time. I used to talk while I ate, and I ate very fast, and I ate lots and lots of food at one sitting. The"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 224 Nagua l told me that a warrior eats four mouthfuls of food at one time. A while later he eats anot her four mout hfuls and so on. “A warrior also walks miles and miles every day. My eating weakne ss never let me walk. I broke it by eating four mout hfuls every hour and by walking. Som etimes I walked all day and all night . That was the way I lost the fat on my but tocks.” She laughe d at her ow n recollection of the nickna me don Juan had given her. “But stalking your weakne sses is not enoug h to drop them,” she said. “You can stalk them from now to doom sday and it won’ t make a bit of difference. That’s why the Nagu al didn’ t want to tell me what to do. What a warrior really needs in order to be an impeccable stalker is to have a pur pos e.” La Gorda recount ed how she had lived from day to day, before she met the Nagua l, with not hing to look forward to. She had no hope s, no dreams, no desire for anyt hing. The oppor tuni ty to eat, how ever, was always accessible to her; for som e reason that she coul d not fathom , there had been plenty of food available to her every singl e day of her life. So much of it, in fact, that at one time she weighe d two hundr ed and thirtysix pounds . “Eating was the onl y thing I enjoye d in life,” la Gorda said. “Besides, I never saw myself as being fat. I thought I was rather pretty and that peopl e liked me as I was. Everyone said that I looke d health y. “The Nagua l told me som ething very strange. He said that I had an enor mous amoun t of persona l pow er and due to that I had always managed to get food from friends while the relatives in my ow n hous e were goi ng hungr y. “Everyb ody has enough persona l pow er for som ething. The trick for me was to pul l my persona l pow er away from food to my warrior’s pur pos e.” “And what is that pur pos e, Gorda?” I asked half in jest."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 225 “To enter into the other world,” she replied with a grin and pretende d to hit me on top of my h ead with her knuc kles, the way don Juan used to do when he thought I was indul ging. There was no more light for me to write. I wanted her to bring a lantern but she com plained that she was too tired and had to sleep a bit before the little sisters arrived. We went into the front roo m. She gave me a blanke t, then wrappe d herself in anot her one and fell asleep instantly. I sat with my back against the wall. The brick surface of the bed was hard even with four straw mats. It was more com fortable to lie dow n. T he mom ent I did I fell asleep. I woke up sudde nly with an unbe arable thirst. I wanted to go to the kitchen to drink som e water but I coul d not orient myself in the darkne ss. I coul d feel la Gorda bundl ed up in her blanke t next to me. I shook her two or thr ee times and asked her to help me get som e water. She grum bled som e uni ntelligible words. She appa rently was so sound asleep that she did not want to wake up. I shook her again and sudde nly she woke up; onl y it was not la Gorda. Whoe ver I was shaking yelle d at me in a gruff, masculine voi ce to shut up. There was a man there in place of la Gorda! My fright was instantaneous and unc ont rollable. I jum ped out of bed and ran for the front door . But my sense of orientation was off and I ende d up out in the kitche n. I grabbe d a lantern and lit it as fast as I coul d. La Gorda came out of the out hous e in the back at that mom ent and asked me if there was som ething wrong. I nervous ly told her what had happe ned. She seemed a bit disoriented herself. Her mout h was ope n and her eyes had lost their usual sheen. She shook her head vigor ous ly and that seemed to restore her alertness. She took the lantern and we walked into the fron t room . There was no one in the bed. La Gorda lit three more lanterns. She appe ared to be wor ried. She told me to stay where I was, then she ope ned the door to their"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 226 room . I not iced that there was light com ing from inside. She closed the door again and said in a matteroffact tone not to worry, that it was not hing, and that she was goi ng to make us som ething to eat. With the speed and efficiency of a shor torder cook she made som e food. She also made a hot choc olate drink with cornmeal. We sat across from each other and ate in complete silence. The night was cold. It looke d as if it was going to ra in. The three kerosene lanterns that she had brought to the dining area cast a yellow ish light that was very soot hing. She took som e boa rds that were stacked up on the floor , against the wall, and placed them vertically in a deep groove on the transverse s uppor ting beam of the roof . There was a long slit in the floor parallel to the beam that served to hol d the boa rds in place. The result was a por table wall that enclosed the dining area. “Who was in the bed?” I asked. “In bed, next to you, was Josefina, w ho else?” she replied as if savor ing her words, and then laughe d. “She’s a master at joke s like that. For a mom ent I thought it was som ething else, but then I caught the scent that Josefina’s body has when she’s carrying out one of her pranks .” “What was s he trying to do? Scare me to death?” I asked. “You’ re not their favor ite, you know ,” she replied. “They don’ t like to be taken out of the path they’re familiar with. They hate the fact that Soledad is leaving. They don’ t want to unde rstand that we are all leaving this area. It looks like our time is up. I kne w that toda y.

It looks as if t hat depends on you. On your pow er.” “On me? In what way, Gorda?” “Let me expl ain. The day before you arrived the little sisters and I went to the city.

I figur ed that my vision was telling me that I had to go to the city and trust my pow er to find you there. I was sure that you were on your way.” “Did the little sisters know why you took them to the city?” I asked. “I didn’ t t ell them anyt hing, ” she replied. “I just took them there. We wande red around the streets all morning. ” Her statements put me in a very strange frame of mind. Spasms of nervous excitation ran through my entire body. I had to stand up and walk around for a mom ent. I sat dow n again and told her that I had been in the city the same day, and that I had wande red around the marketplace all afternoon looki ng for don Juan. She stared at me with her mout h ope n. “We must have passed each other,” she said and sighe d. “We were in the market and in the park. We sat on the steps of the chur ch most of the afternoon so as not to attract attention to our selves.” The hot el where I had stayed was practically next door to the chur ch. I remembered that I had stood for a long tim e looki ng at the peopl e on the steps of the chur ch. Som ething was pul ling me to examine them. I had the absurd not ion that bot h don Juan and don Genaro were goi ng to be among thos e peopl e, sitting like begga rs just to surprise me. “When did you leave the c ity?” I asked. “We left around five o’clock and headed for the Nagua l’s spot in the mount ains,” she replied."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 228 I had also had the certainty that don Juan had left at the end of the day. The feelings I had had dur ing that entire episode of looki ng for do n Jua n became very clear to me. In light of what she had told me I had to revise my stand. I had conve niently expl ained away the certainty I had had that don Juan was there in the streets of the city as an irrationa l expe ctation, a result of my cons istently fin ding him there in the past. But la Gorda had been in the city actually looki ng for me and she was the being closest to don Juan in temperament. I had felt all along that his presence was there. La Gorda’s statement had merely conf irmed som ething that my bo dy kne w beyond the shadow of a doubt . I not iced a flutter of nervous ness in her body when I told her the details of my mood that day. “What woul d’ve happe ned if you had foun d me?” I asked. “Everything woul d’ve been change d,” she replied. “For me to find yo u woul d’ve meant that I had enough po wer to move forward. That’s why I took the little sisters with me. All of us, you, me and the little sisters, woul d’ve gone away toge ther that day.” “Where to, Gorda?” “Who know s? If I had the pow er to find yo u I woul d’ ve also had the pow er to know that. It’s your turn now . Perhaps you will have enough pow er now to know where we shoul d go. Do you see what I mean?” I had an attack of profound sadne ss at that poi nt. I felt more acutely than ever the despair of my hum an fra ilty and tempor ariness. Don Juan had always maintained that the onl y deterrent to our despair was the awareness of our death, the key to the sorcerer’s scheme of things . His idea was that the a wareness of our death was the onl y thing that coul d give us th e strengt h to withstand the dur ess and pain of our lives and our fears of the unkno wn. But what he coul d never tell me was how to bring that awareness to the foreground. He had insisted, every time I"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 229 had asked him, that my vol ition alone was the deciding f actor; in other words, I had to make up my mind to bring that awareness to bear witness to my acts. I thought I had done so. But conf ront ed with la Gorda’s determination to find me and go away with me, I realized that if she had found me in the city that d ay I woul d never have returned to my hom e, never again woul d I have seen thos e I held dear. I had not been prepared for that. I had braced myself for dyi ng, but not for disappe aring for the rest of my life in full awareness, without ange r or disappoi ntmen t, leaving behind the best of my feelings . I was almost embarrassed to tell la Gorda that I was not a warrior worthy of having the kind of pow er that must be needed to perform an act of that nature: to leave for good and to know where to go and what to do. “We are hum an creatures,” she said. “Who know s what’s waiting for us or what kind of pow er we may have?” I told her that my sadne ss in leaving like that was too great. The change s that sorcerers went through were too drastic and too final. I recount ed to her what Pablito had told me about his unbe arable sadne ss at having lost his mother. “The hum an form feeds itself on thos e feelings ,” she said dryly. “I pitied myself and my little children for years. I coul dn’ t unde rstand how the Nagua l coul d be so cruel to ask me to do what I did: to leave my children, to destroy them and to forget them.” She said that it took her years to unde rstand that the Nagua l also had had to choos e to leave the hum an form. He was not being cruel. He simply did not have any more hu man feelings . To him everything was equa l. He had accepted his fate. The probl em with Pablito, and myself for that matter, was that neither of us had accepted our fate. La Gorda said, in a scornful way, that Pablito wept when he remembered his mother, his Manue lita, especially when he had to cook his ow n food. She urged me to remember Pablito’s mother as she was: an old, stupi d"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 230 wom an who kne w not hing else but to be Pablito’s servant. She said that the reason all of them thought he was a cow ard was because he coul d not be happy that his servant Manue lita had becom e the witch Soledad, who coul d kill him like she woul d step on a bug. La Gorda stood up dramatically and leaned ove r the table unt il her forehead was almost touc hing mine. “The Nagua l said that Pab lito’s good fortune was extraordinary,” she said. “Mother and son fight ing for the same thing. If he weren’t the cow ard he is, he woul d accept his fate and oppos e Soledad like a warrior, without fear or hatred. In the end the best woul d win and take all. If Soledad is the winne r, Pablito shoul d be happy with his fate and wish her well. But onl y a real warrior can feel that kind of happi ness.” “How doe s dona Soledad feel about all this?” “She doe sn’t indul ge in her feelings ,” la Gorda replied and sat dow n a gain. “She has accepted her fate more readily than any one of us. Before the Nagua l helped her she was worse off than myself. At least I was young; she was an old cow , fat and tired, beggi ng for her death to com e. Now death will have to fight to claim her. ” The time element in dona Soledad’s transformation was a detail that had puz zled me. I told la Gorda that I remembered having seen dona Soledad no more than two years before and she was the same old lady I had always know n. La Gorda said that the last tim e I had been in Soledad’s hous e, unde r the impression that it was still Pablito’s hous e, the Nagua l had set them up to act as if everything were the same. Dona Soledad greeted me, as she always did, from the kitchen, and I really did not face her. Lidia, R osa, Pablito and Nestor played their roles to perfection in order to keep me from findi ng out about their true activities. “Why woul d the Nagua l go to all that troub le, Gorda?”"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 231 “He was saving you for som ething that’s not clear yet.

She’s crazy and can’t help herself. She wanted to play her pranks on you. She used to follow you around and yo u n ever kne w it. One night when the Nagua l had taken you to the mount ains, she nearly pus hed you dow n a ravine in the darkne ss. The Nagua l found her in the nick of time. She doe sn’t do thos e things out of meanne ss, but because she enjoys being that way. That’ s her hum an form. She’ll be that way unt il she loses it. I’ve told you that all six of them are a bit off. You must be aware of that so as not to be caught in their webs. If you do get caught , don’ t get angr y. They can’t help themselves.” She was silent fo r a while. I caught the almost imperceptible sign of a flutter in her body. Her eyes seemed to get out of focus and her mout h droppe d as if the muscles of her jaw had given in. I became engr ossed in watching her. She shook her head two or three times. “I’v e just seen som ething, ” she said. “You’ re just like the little sisters and the Genaros.” She began to laugh qui etly. I did not say anyt hing. I wanted her to expl ain herself withou t my meddl ing. “Everyb ody gets angr y with you because it hasn’t dawned on the m yet that you’ re no different than they are,” she went on. “They see you as the Nagua l and they don’ t unde rstand that you indul ge in your ways just like they do in theirs.” She said that Pablito whined and com plained and played at being a weakling. Benign o played the shy one , the one who coul d not even ope n his eyes. Nestor played to be the wise one , the one who know s everything. Lidia played the tough wom an who coul d crush anyone with a look. Josefina was the crazy one who"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 232 coul d not be trusted.

That was my form. “I will have to tell everybody what I have seen about you so they won’ t feel offende d by you r acts.” I did not know what to say. I felt that she was unde niably righ t. The impor tant issue for me was not so much her accurateness but the fact that I had witnessed her arriving at her unque stionable conc lusion. “How did you see all that?” I asked. “It just came to me,” she replied. “How did it com e to you? ” “I felt the fe eling of seeing com ing to the top of my head, and then I kne w what I’ve just told you. ” I insisted that she describe to me every detail of the feeling of seeing that she was alludi ng to. She com plied after a mom ent’s vacillation and gave me an account of t he same ticklish sensation I had becom e so aware of dur ing my conf ron tations with dona Soledad and the little sisters.

I asked her if she had also felt a dry sound of a woode n pipe being broke n at t he base of her neck. “The Nagua l taught all of us how to get the feeling on top of the head,” she said. “But not everyone of us can do it. The sound behind the throat is even more difficult. None of us has ever felt it yet. It’s strange that you have when you’ re still empty.” “How doe s that sound work?” I asked. “And what is it?” “You know that better than I do.

I’ve never seen myself. But I’ve seen everyone else. All of us are amber. And all of us, with the exception of you, are like a tom bstone .

She had two children; one of them was a girl. Fortuna tely for Soledad her daught er died. The Nagua l said that the edge of the spirit of a person who dies goe s back to the givers, meaning that that edge goe s back to the parents. If the givers ar e dead and the person has children, the edge goe s to the child who is com plete. And if all the children are com plete, that edge goe s to the one with pow er and not necessarily to the best or the most diligent. For example, when Josefina’s mother died, the e dge went to the craziest of the lot, Josefina.

I coul d not conc eive hur ting a child in any sense, not for any rea son. “The Nagua l didn’ t make the rule,” she said. “The rule is made som ewhere out there, and not by a man.” I defende d myself by saying that I was not angr y with her or the Nagua l but that I was argui ng in the abstract, because I coul d not fathom the value of it all. “The value is that we need all our edge , all our pow er, our com pleteness in order to enter into that other world,” she said. “I was a religious wom an. I coul d tell you what I used to repeat without know ing what I meant. I wanted my soul to ente r the kingdom of heaven. I still want that, except that I’m on a different path. The world of the nagua l is the kingdom of heaven.” I obj ected to her religious connot ation on principle. I had becom e accustom ed by don Juan never to dw ell on that subj ect. Sh e very calmly expl ained that she saw no difference in terms of lifestyle between us and true nuns and priests. She poi nted out that not onl y were true nuns and priests com plete as a rule, but they did not even weaken themselves with sexua l acts. “The Nagua l said that that is the reason they will never be exterminated, no matter who tries to exterminate them,” she said. “Thos e who are after them are always empty; they don’ t have the vigor that true nuns and priests have. I liked the Nagua l for saying that. I will always cheer for the nuns and priests. We are alike. We have given up the world and yet we are in the midst of it. Priests and nuns woul d make great flying sorcerers if som eone woul d tell them that they can do it.” The memory of my father’s and my gr andf ather’s adm iration for the Mexican revol ution came to my mind.

I onc e told don Juan, as if I were voi cing my ow n opi nion, som ething I had heard all my life, that the favor ite ploy of the Chur ch was to keep us in ignor ance.

Or perhaps it woul d be more appr opr iate to say, in light of the out landi sh acts I had witnessed and performed since my arrival, that my re ason was defendi ng itself, inde pende ntly of the more com plex whol e that seemed to be the “me” I did not know . I was witnessing, almost in the fashion of an interested obs erver, how my reason struggl ed to find suitable rationa les, while anot her, much larger por tion of me coul d not have cared less about expl aining anyt hing. La Gorda made the three girls line up. She then pul led me to her side. All of them folded their arms behind their backs. La Gorda made me do the same. She stretched my arms as far back as they woul d go and then made me bend them and grab each forearm as tight ly as pos sible as close to the elbow s as I coul d. That created a great muscular pressure at the articulations of my shoul ders. She pus hed my trunk forward un til I was almost stoopi ng. Then she made a peculiar birdcall. That was a signa l.

La Gorda told me to follow close to her. She made one more birdcall and we bot h started walking. I was surprised at the ease with which I walked. My entire balance was center ed in my legs. The fact that I had my arms behind my back, instead of hinde ring my move ments, aided me in maintaining a strange equi librium . But above all what surprised me the most was the qui etness of my steps. When we reached the road we began to walk n ormally. We passed two men goi ng in the oppos ite direction. La Gorda greeted them and they answered back. When we arrived at the hous e we found the little sisters standi ng by the door , not daring to go in. La Gorda told them that although I coul d not cont r ol the allies I coul d either call them or tell them to leave, and that the allies woul d not bot her us any longe r. The girls believed her, som ething I myself coul d not do in that instance. We went inside. In a very qui et and efficient manne r all of them und ressed, drenched themselves with cold water and put on a fresh change of clothes. I did the same. I put on the old clothes I used to keep in don Juan’s hous e, which la Gorda brought to me in a box. All of us were in high spirits. I asked la Gorda to expl ai n to me what we had done . “We’ll talk about that later,” she said in a firm tone . I remembered then that the packages I had for them were still in the car. I thought that while la Gorda was cooki ng som e food for us it woul d be a good oppor tunity to distrib ute them. I went out and got them and brought them into the hous e.

I felt embarrassed. She was absolutely right in everything that she had said. “You are careless, that’s why I’ve never liked you, ” Lidia said to me, changi ng her smile into a frow n. “You have never greeted me with affection or respect. Every time we saw each other you onl y pretende d to be happy to see me.” She imitated my obv ious ly cont rived effusive greeting, a greeting I must have given her c ount less times in the past. “Why didn’ t you ever ask me what I was doing here?” Lidia asked me. I stoppe d writing to cons ider her poi nt. It had never occurred to me to ask her anyt hing. I told her that I had no excuse. La Gorda interceded and said that the reason that I had never said more than two words to either Lidia or Rosa each time I saw them was because I was accustom ed to talking onl y to wom en that I was enamored of, in one way or anot her. La Gorda adde d that the Nagua l had told them that if I woul d ask them anyt hing directly they were suppos ed to answer my que stions , but as long as I did not ask, they were not suppos ed to mention anyt hing.

Rosa and Josefina did not say a word. Judgi ng by the serious and mean expr essions on their faces, how ever, they seemed to agree with Lidia. “How can this ma n lead us?” Lidia asked la Gorda. “He’s not a true nagua l. He’s a man. He’s goi ng to make us into idiots like himself.” As she was talking I coul d see the mean expr essions on Rosa’s and Josefina’s faces getting even harder. La Gorda intervened and expl aine d to them what she had “seen” earlier about me. She adde d that since she had recom mende d to me not to get entangl ed in their webs, she was recom mendi ng the same thing to them, not to get entangl ed in mine. After Lidia’s initial display of genui ne and wellf oun ded animosity, I was flabbe rgasted to see how easily she acqui esced to la Gorda’s remarks. She smiled at me. She even came and sat next to me. “You’ re really like us, eh?” she asked in a tone of bewilderment. I did not know what to say. I was afraid of blunde ring.

In order to make them feel at ease I gave them an account of how I had met don Juan. Their account s were the same as what dona Soledad had already told me. Lidia said that all of them had been free to leave don Juan’s world but their choi ce had been to stay. She, in particular, being the first appr entice, was given an oppor tunity to go away. After the Nagua l and Genaro had cured her, the Nagu al had poi nted to the door and told her that if she did not go through it then, the door woul d close her in and woul d never ope n again. “My fate was sealed when that door closed,” Lidia said to me. “Just like what happe ned to you. The Nagua l told me that a fter he had put a patch on you, you had a chance to leave but you didn’ t want to take it.” I remembered that particular decision more vividly than anyt hing else. I recount ed to them how don Juan had tricked me into believing that a sorceress was after him, and then he gave me the choi ce of either leaving for good or staying to help him wage a war against his attacker. It turned out that his alleged attacker was one of his conf ederates. By conf ront ing her, on what I thought was don Juan’s behalf, I turned he r against me and she became what he called my “worthy oppone nt.” I asked Lidia if they had had a worthy oppo nent themselves. “We are not as dum b as you are,” she said. “We never needed anyone to spur us.” “Pablito is that dum b,” Rosa said. “Soledad is his oppone nt. I don’ t know how worthy she is, though.

She walked ove r to the table and put her foot on the bench and rested her chi n on her arm and kne e. “Sorcerers like the Nagua l and Genaro have two cycles,” she said. “The first is when they’re hum an, like our selves. We are in our first cycle. Each of us has been given a task and that task is making us leave the hum an form. Eligio, the five of us, and the Genaros are of the same cycle. “The second cycle is when a sorcerer is not hum an anym ore, like the Nagua l and Genaro. They came to teach us, and after they taught us they left. We are the second cycle to them. “The Nagua l and la Cat alina are like you and Lidia. They are in the same pos itions .

The Nagua l said that you were crazier than Josefina, and impos sible like Lidia, and he had to give you a lot of them.” La Gorda expl ained that pow er plants were used onl y by sorcerers who had mastered their art. Thos e plants were such a pow erful affair that in order to be prope rly handl ed, the most impeccable attention was needed on the part of the sorcerer. It took a lifetime to train one ’s att ention to the degree needed. La Gorda said that com plete peopl e do not need pow er plants, and that neither the little sisters nor the Genaros had ever taken them, but that som eday when they had perfected their art as dreamers, they woul d use them to get a final and total boos t, a boos t of such magni tude that it woul d be impos sible for us to unde rstand. “Woul d you and I take them too? ” I asked la Gorda. “All of us,” she replied. “The Nagua l said that you shoul d unde rstand this poi nt better than any of us.” I cons idered the issue for a mom ent. The effect of psychot rop ic plants had inde ed been terrifying for me. They seemed to reach a vast reservoi r in me, and extract from it a total world. The drawback in taking them had been the toll they took on my phys ical wellbeing and the impossibility of cont rolling their effect. The world they plun ged me into was una menable and chaotic. I lacked the cont rol, the pow er, in don Juan’s terms, to make use of such a world. If I woul d have the cont rol, how ever, the pos sibiliti es woul d be stagge ring to the mind. “I took them, myself,” Josefina said all of a sudde n. “When I was crazy the Nagua l gave me his pipe, to cure me or kill me.

That was her cure.” La Gorda went back to the stove . The litt le sisters laughe d and patted one anot her on the back. I remembered then that at dona Soledad’s hous e Lidia had not onl y intimated that don Juan had left a package for me but she had actually show n me a bundl e that had made me think of the sheath in which don Juan used to keep his pipe. I reminde d Lidia that she had said that they woul d give me that package when la Gorda was present. The little sisters looke d at one anot her and then turned to la Gorda. She made a gesture with her head. Josefina stood up and went to the front room . She returned a mom ent later with the bundl e that Lidia had show n me. I had a pang of anticipation in the pit of my stom ach. Josefina carefully placed the bundl e on the table in front of me. All of them gathered around. She began t o unt ie it as ceremoni ous ly as Lidia had done the first time. When the package was com pletely unw rappe d, she spilled the cont ents on the table. They were menstruation rags. I got flustered for an instant. But the sound of la Gorda’s laught er, which was lou der than the others’, was so pleasing that I had to laugh myself. “That’s Josefina’s persona l bundl e,” la Gorda said. “It was her brilliant idea to play on your greed for a gift from the Nagua l, in order to make you stay.” “You have to adm it that it was a good idea,” Lidia said to me. She imitated the look of greed I had on my face when she was ope ning the package and then my look of disappoi ntment when she did not finish."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 260 I told Josefina that her idea had inde ed been brilliant, that it had worked as she ha d anticipated, and that I had wanted that package more than I woul d care to adm it. “You can have it, if you want it,” Josefina said and made everybody laugh. La Gorda said that the Nagua l had know n from the beginni ng that Josefina was not really ill, and t hat that was the reason it had been so difficult for him to cure her. Peopl e who are actually sick are more pliable. Josefina was too aware of everything and very un ruly and he had had to smoke her a great many times. Don Juan had onc e said the same thing about me, that he had smoke d me. I had always believed that he was referring to having used psychot ropi c mushroom s to have a view of me. “How did he smoke you? ” I asked Josefina. She shrugge d her shoul ders and did not answer. “The same way he smoke d you, ” Lidia said. “He pul led your lum inos ity and dried it with the smoke from a fire that he had made.” I was sure that don Juan had never expl ained such a thing to me. I asked Lidia to tell me what she kne w about the subj ect. She turned to la Gorda. “Smoke is v ery impo rtant for sorcerers,” la Gorda said. “Smoke is like fog. Fog is of cour se better, but it’s too hard to handl e. It’s not as handy as smoke is. So if a sorcerer wants to see and know som eone who is always hiding, like you and Josefina, who are capri cious and difficult, the sorcerer makes a fire and lets the smoke enve lop the person. Whatever they’re hiding com es out in the smoke .” La Gorda said that the Nagua l used smoke not onl y to “see” and know peopl e but also to cure. He gave Josefina smoke baths ; he made her stand or sit by the fire in the direction the wind was blow ing.

He said that you were unbe arable, and you were not even pretendi ng, like she was.” It all became clear to me. She was right ; do n Ju an had made me sit in front of a fire hundr eds of times. The smoke used to irritate my throat and eyes to such a degree that I dreaded to see him begin to gather dry twigs and branches. He said that I had to learn to cont rol my breathing and feel the smoke while I kept my eyes closed; that way I coul d breathe without choki ng. La Gorda said that smoke had helped Josefina to be ethereal and very elusive, and that no doubt it had helped me to cure my madne ss, whatever it was. “The Nagua l said that smoke takes everything out of you, ” la Gorda went on. “It makes you clear and direct.” I asked her if she kne w how to bring out with the smoke whatever a person was hiding. She said that she coul d easily do it because of having lost her form, but that the little siste rs and the Genaros, although they had seen the Nagua l and Genaro do it scores of times, coul d not yet do it themselves. I was curious to know why don Juan had never mentione d the subj ect to me, in spite of the fact that he had smoke d me like dry fish hundr eds of times. “He did,” la Gorda said with her usual conv iction. “The Nagua l even taught you fog gazing. He told us that onc e you smoke d a whol e place in the mount ains and saw what was hiding behind the scenery.

Lidia shook her head and clicked h er tongue . “You sure are dum b,” she said. “The Nagual taught you everything. How do you think you saw what you have just told us about ?” There was an abys s between our unde rstandi ng of how to teach som ething.

La Gorda returned to the table. “That’s onl y if the sorcerer is teaching som ething about the tona l,” she said. “When the s orcerer is dealing with the nagua l, he must give the instruction, which is to show the mystery to the warrior. And that’s all he has to do. The warrior who receives the mysteries must claim know ledge as pow er, by doi ng what he has been show n. “The Nagua l s how ed you more mysteries than all of us toge ther.

I failed, therefore, to determine in what way coul d the acts of the little sisters be different. “You mean you didn’ t see how they were hol ding ont o the lines of the world?” She asked. “No, I didn’ t.” “You didn’ t see them slippi ng through the crack between the worlds?” I narrated to them what I had witnessed. They listened in si lence. At the end of my account la Gorda seemed to be on the verge of tears. “What a pity! “ she exclaimed. She stood up and walked around the table and embraced me. Her eyes were clear and restful. I kne w she bor e no malice tow ard me. “It’s our fate that you are plugge d up like this,” she said. “But you’ re still the Nagua l to us.

The closest way of describing it woul d be to say that I felt that my ears had sudde nly poppe d.

It was as if I were hearing the buz zing with som e part of me other than my ears. A hot flash went through my body. And then I sudde nly recalled som ething I had never seen. It was as though an alien memory had taken pos session of me. I remembered Lidia pul ling herself from two hor izon tal, reddi sh rope s as she walked on the wall. She was not really walking; she was actually gliding on a thick bundl e of lines that she held with her feet. I remembered seeing her panting with her mout h ope n, from the exertion of pul ling the reddi sh rope s. The reason I coul d not hol d my balance at the end of her display was because I was seeing her as a light that went around the room so fast that it made me dizzy; it pul led me from the area around my navel. I remembered Rosa’s actions and Josefina’s as well . Rosa had actually brachiated, with her left arm hol ding ont o long, vertical, reddi sh fibers that looke d like vines droppi ng from the dark roof . With her right arm she was also hol ding som e vertical fibers that seemed to give her stability. She also held ont o the same fibers with her toes.

At the end of h er display Josefina, like Lidia and Rosa, was just a patch of light . I coul d switch from one recollection to the other in my mind.

She laughe d with true delight and said that the Nagua l was right in saying that I was too lazy to remember what I had “seen”; therefore, I onl y bot hered with what I had looke d at. Is it pos sible, I thought to mys elf, that I am unc ons cious ly selecting what I recall? Or is it la Gorda who is creating all this? If it was true that I had selected my recall at first and then released what I had censored, then it also had to be true that I must have perceived much more of don Juan’s and don Genaro’s actions , and yet I coul d onl y recall a selective part of my total perception of thos e events. “It’s hard to believe,” I said to la Gorda, “that I can remember now som ething I didn ’t remember at all a while ago. ” “The Nagua l s aid that everyone can see, and yet we choos e not to remember what we see,” she said. “Now I unde rstand how right he was. All of us can see; som e, more than others.” I told la Gorda that som e part of me kne w that I had found then a transcende ntal key. A mis sing piece had been hande d dow n to me by all of them. But it was difficult to discern what it was. She announc ed that she had just “seen” that I had practiced a good deal of “dreaming, ” and that I had develope d my attention, and yet I was fool ed by my ow n appe arance of not know ing anyt hing. “I’ve been trying to tell you abou t attention ,” she proceeded, “but you know as much as we do about it.” I assured her that my know ledge was intrinsically different from theirs; theirs was infinitely more spectacular tha n mine. Anyt hing they might say to me in relation to their practices, therefore, was a bonus to me. “The Nagua l told us to show you that with our attention we can hol d the images of a dream in the same way we hol d the images of the world,” la Gorda said. “The art of the dreamer is the art of attention. ”"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" 267 Though ts came dow n on me like a lands lide.

I kne w then that don Juan had told me and show ed me everything he coul d. I had not been able, how ever, to realize the premises of his know ledge in my body while he was around. He had said that my reason was the demon that kept m e chained, and that I had to vanqui sh it if I wanted to achieve the realization of his teachings . The issue, therefore, had been how to vanqui sh my reason. It had never occurred to me to press him for a definition of what he meant by reason. I presum ed all along that he meant the capacity for com prehend ing, inferring or thinki ng, in an orderly, rationa l way. From what la Gorda had said, I kne w that to him reason meant attention. Don Juan said that the core of our being was the act of perceiving, and that th e magic of our being was the act of awareness. For him perception and awareness were a singl e, func tiona l, inextricable uni t, a uni t which had two dom ains. The first one was the “attention of the tona l”; that is to say, the capacity of average peopl e to pe rceive and place their awareness on the ordinary world of everyday life. Don Juan also called this form of attention our “first ring of pow er,” and described it as our awesom e but takenforgranted ability to impart order to our perception of our daily world . The second dom ain was the “attention of the nagua l”; that is to say, the capacity of sorcerers to place their awareness on the nonor dinary world. He called this dom ain of attention the “second ring of pow er,” or the altoge ther por tentous ability that all of us have, but onl y sorcerers use, to impart order to the nonor dinary world.

In fact it was evident that I had placed my attention on bot h dom ains. Perhaps all of us are cont inua lly perceiving in bot h fashions but choos e to isolate one for recollection and discard the other or p erhaps we file it away, as I myself had done .

What don Juan had struggl ed to vanqui sh, or rather suppr ess in me, was n ot my reason as the capacity for rationa l thoug ht, but my “attention of the tona l,” or my awareness of the world of com mon sense. His motive for wanting me to do so was expl ained by la Gorda when she said that the daily world exists because we know how to hol d its images; cons eque ntly, if one drops the attention needed to maintain thos e images, the world collapses. “The Nagua l told us that practice is what count s,” la Gorda said sudde nly. “Once you get your attention on the images of your dream, your attent ion is hooke d for goo d. In the end you can be like Genaro, who coul d hol d the images of any dream.” “We each have five other dreams,” Lidia said. “But we show ed you the first one because that was the dream the Nagua l gave us.” “Can all of you go into dream ing any time you want?” I asked. “No,” la Gorda replied. “Dreaming takes too much pow er. None of us has that much pow er. The reason the little sisters had to roll on the floor so many times was that in rolling the earth was giving them energy. Maybe you c oul d also remember seeing them as lum inous beings getting energy from the ligh t of the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":" 269 earth. The Nagua l said that the best way of getting energy is, of cour se, to let the sun inside the eyes, especially the left eye.” I told her that I kne w not hing about it, and she described a procedur e that don Juan had taught them. As she spoke I remembered that don Juan had also taught the same procedur e to me. It cons isted in movi ng my head slow ly from side to side as I caught the sunl ight with my halfclosed left eye. He said that one coul d not onl y use the sun but coul d use any kind of light that coul d shine on the eyes. La Gorda said that the Nagua l had recom mende d that they tie their shawls below their waists in order to protect their hipbone s when they rolled. I co mmented that don Juan had never mentione d rolling to me. She said that onl y wom en coul d roll because they had wom bs and energy came directly into their wom bs; by rolling arou nd they distributed that energy ove r the rest of their bodi es. In order for a man to be energized he had to be on his back, with his kne es bent so that the soles of his feet touc hed each other. His arms had to be extende d laterally, with his forearms raised vertically, and the finge rs clawed in an upr ight pos ition. “We have been dreamin g thos e dreams for years,” Lidia said. “Thos e dreams are our best, because our attention is com plete. In the other dreams that we have, our attention is still shaky. ” La Gorda said that hol ding the images of dreams was a Toltec art. After years of cons um in g practice each one of them was able to perform one act in any dream. Lidia coul d walk on anyt hing, Rosa coul d dangl e from anyt hing, Josefina coul d hide behind anyt hing and she herself coul d fly. But they were onl y beginne rs, appr entices of the art. They h ad com plete attention for onl y one activity. She adde d that Genaro was the master of “dreaming” and coul d turn the tables around and have attention for as many activities as we have in our daily life, and that for him the two do mains of attention had the s ame value."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" 270 I felt com pelled to ask them my usual que stion: I had to know their procedur es, how they held the images of their dreams. “You know that as well as we do, ” la Gorda said. “The onl y thing I can say is that after goi ng to the same dream ove r and o ver, we began to feel the lines of the world. They helped us to do what you saw us doi ng. ” Don Juan had said that our “first ring of po wer” is enga ged very early in our lives and that we live unde r the impression that that is all there is to us. Our “secon d ring of pow er,” the “attention of the nagua l,” remains hidde n for the immense majority of us, and onl y at the mom ent of our death is it revealed to us. There is a pathw ay to reach it, how ever, which is available to every one of us, but which onl y sorcere rs take, and that pathw ay is through “dreaming. ” “Dreaming” was in essence the transformation of ordinary dreams into affairs invol ving vol ition. Dreamers, by enga ging their “attention of the nagua l” and focusing it on the items and events of their ordinar y dreams, change thos e dreams into “dreaming. ” Don Juan said that there were no procedur es to arrive at the attention of the nagua l. He onl y gave me poi nters. Findi ng my hands in my dreams was the first poi nter; then the exercise of paying attention was el onga ted to findi ng obj ects, looki ng for specific features, such as bui ldings , streets and so on. From there the jum p was to “dreaming” about specific places at specific times of the day. The final stage was drawing the “attention of the nagua l” to focus on the total self. Don Juan said that that final stage was usually ushered in by a dream that many of us have had at one time or anot her, in which one is looki ng at one self sleeping in bed. By the time a sorcerer has had such a dream, his attention has been develope d to such a degree that instead of waking himself up, as most of us woul d do in a similar situation, he turns on his heels and enga ges himself in activity, as if he were acting in the world of everyda y life. From that mom ent on there is a breakage, a"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 271 division of sorts in the otherwise uni fied persona lity. The result of enga ging the “attention of the nagua l” and developi ng it to the height and sophi stication of our daily attention of the world was, in don Juan’s scheme, the other self, an identical b eing as one self, but made in “dreaming. ” Don Juan had told me that there are no definite standa rd steps for teaching that doubl e, as there are no definite steps for us to reach our daily awareness. We simply do it by practicing. He cont ende d that in the ac t of enga ging our “attention of the nagua l,” we woul d find the steps. He urged me to practice “dreaming” without letting my fears make it into an encum bering produc tion. He had done the same with la Gorda and the little sisters, but obvi ous ly som ething in them had made them more receptive to the idea of anot her level of attention. “Genaro was in his body of dreaming most of the time,” la Gorda said. “He liked it better. That’s why he coul d do the weirdest things and scare you half to death. Genaro coul d go in and out of the crack between the worlds like you and I can go in and out a door .” Don Juan had also talked to me at great lengt h about the crack between the worlds. I had always believed that he was talking in a metaphor ical sense about a subt le divisio n between the world that the average man perceives and the world that sorcerers perceive. La Gorda and the little sisters had show n me that the crack between the worlds was more than a metaphor . It was rather the capacity to change levels of attention. One part of me unde rstood la Gorda perfectly, while anot her part of me was more fright ened than ever. “You have been asking where the Nagua l and Genaro went,” la Gorda said. “Soledad was very blunt and told you that they went to the other world; Lidia told"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 272 yo u they left this area; the Genaros were stupi d and scared you. The truth is that the Nagua l and Genaro went through that crack.” For som e reason, unde finable to me, her statements plunge d me into profound chaos. I had felt all along that they had left for good. I kne w that they had not left in an ordinary sense, but I had kept that feeling in the realm of a metapho r. Although I had even voi ced it to close friends, I think I never really believed it myself. In the depths of me I had always been a rationa l ma n. But la Gorda and the little sisters had turned my obs cure metaph ors into real pos sibilities. La Gorda had actually transpor ted us half a mile with the energy of her “dreaming. ” La Gorda stood up and said that I had unde rstood everything, and that it was time for us to eat. She served us the food that she had cooke d. I did not feel like eating. At the end of the meal she stood up and came to my side. “I think it’s time for you to leave,” she said to me. That seemed to be a cue for the little sisters. They also stood up. “If you stay beyond this mom ent, you won’ t be able to leave anym ore,” la Gorda went on. “The Nagua l gave you freedom onc e, but you chos e to stay with him. He told me that if we all survive the last cont act with the allies I shoul d feed all of you, make you feel good and then say goodbye to all of you. I figur e that the little sisters and myself have no place to go, so there is no choi ce for us. But you are different.” The little sisters surrounde d me and each said goodbye to me. There was a mons trous irony in that situation. I was free to leave but I had no place to go. There was no choi ce for me, either. Years before don Juan gave me a chance to back out , I stayed because already then I had no place to go. “We choos e onl y onc e,” he had said then. “We choos e either to be warriors or to be ordinary men. A second choi ce doe s not exist. Not on this earth.” "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 273 6 The Secon d Attention “You have to leave later on toda y,” la Gorda said to me right after breakfast. “Since you have decided to go with us , you have com mitted your self to helping us fulfill our new task. The Nagua l left me in charge onl y unt il you came. He entrusted me, as you already know , with certain things to tell you. I’ve told you most of them. But there are still som e I coul dn’ t ment ion to you unt il you made your choi ce. Toda y we will take care of them. Right after that you must leave in order to give us time to get ready. We need a few days to settle everything and to prepare to leave these mount ains forever. We have been here a very long time. It’s hard to break away. But everything has com e to a sudde n end. The Nagua l warned us of the total change that you woul d bring, regardless of the out com e of your bout s, but I think no one really believed him.” “I fail to see why you have to ch ange anyt hing, ” I said. “I’ve expl ained it to you already, ” she protested. “We have lost our old pur pos e. Now we have a new one and that new pur pos e requi res that we becom e as light as the breeze. The breeze is our new mood. It used to be the hot wind. You have change d our direction. ” “You are talking in circles, Gorda.” “Yes, but that’s because you’ re empty. I can’t make it any clearer. When you return, the Genaros will show you the art of the stalker and right after that all of us will leave.

The little sisters have already helped her to take her floor apart. That floo r aided her t o reach her attention of the nagua l. The lines had pow er to do that. Each of them helped her gather a piece of that attention. To be incom plete is no handi cap to reaching that attention for som e warriors. Soledad was transformed because she got to that at tention faster than any of us. She doe sn’t have to gaze at her floor anym ore to go into that other world, and now that there is no more need for the floo r, she has returned it to the earth where she got it.” “You are really determined to leave, Gorda, aren ’t you? ” “All of us are. That’s why I’m asking you to go away for a few days to give us time to pul l dow n everything we have.” “Am I the one who has to find a place for all of you, Gorda?” “If you were an impeccable warrior you would do just that. But you ’re not an impeccable warrior, and neither are we. But still we will have to do our best to meet our new challenge .” I felt an oppr essive sense of doom . I have never been one to thrive on respons ibilities. I thought that the com mitment to gui de them was a crushing bur den that I coul d not handl e. “Maybe we don’ t have to do anyt hing, ” I said. “Yes. That’s right ,” she said, and laughe d. “Why don’ t you tell you rself that ove r and ove r unt il you feel safe? The Nagual told you time and time again that the onl y fr eedo m warriors have is to behave impeccably.” She told me how the Nagua l had insisted that all of them unde rstand that not onl y was impeccability freedom but it was the onl y way to scare away the hum an form."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 275 I narrated to her the way don Juan made me unde r stand what was meant by impeccability. He and I were hiking one day through a very steep ravine when a huge boul der got loos e from its matrix on the rock wall and came dow n with a formidable force and lande d on the floor of the canyon, twenty or thirty yar ds from where we were standi ng. The size of the boulder made its fall a very impressive event. Don Juan seized the oppor tuni ty to create a dramatic lesson. He said that the force that rules our destinies is out side of our selves and has not hing to do with o ur acts or vol ition. Som etimes that force woul d make us stop walking on our way and bend ove r to tie our shoe laces, as I had just done . And by making us stop, that force makes us gain a precious mom ent. If we had kept on walking, that enor mous boul der woul d have most certainly crushed us to death. Som e other day, how ever, in anot her ravine the same out side deciding force woul d make us stop again to bend ove r and tie our shoe laces while anot her boul der woul d get loos e precisely above where we are standi ng. B y making us stop, that force woul d have made us lose a precious mom ent. That time if we had kept on walking, we woul d have saved our selves. Don Juan said that in view of my total lack of cont rol ove r the forces which decide my destiny, my onl y pos sible fre edom in that ravine cons isted in my tying my shoe laces impeccably. La Gorda seemed to be move d by my account . For an instant she held my face in her hands from across the table. “Impeccability for me is to tell you, at the right time, what the Nagua l told me to tell you, ” she said. “But pow er has to time perfectly what I have to reveal to yon, or it won’ t have any effect.” She paused in a dramatic fashion. Her delay was very studi ed but terribly effective with me. “What is it?” I asked desperately."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 276 She did not answer. She took me by the arm and led me to the area just out side the front doo r. She made me sit on the hardpa cked ground with my back against a thick pol e about one and a half feet high that looke d like a tree stum p which had been planted in the gro und almost against the wall of the hous e. There was a row of five such pol es planted about two feet apart. I had meant to ask la Gorda what their function was. My first impression had been that a former ow ner of the hous e had tied animals to them. My conj e cture seemed incongr uo us, how ever, because the area just out side the front door was a kind of roof ed po rch. I told la Gorda my suppos ition as she sat down next to me to my left, with her back against anot her pol e. She laughe d and said that the pol es were i nde ed used for tying animals of sorts, but not by a former ow ner, and that she had nearly broke n her back diggi ng the hol es for them. “What do you use them for?” I asked. “Let’s say that we tie our selves to them,” she replied. “And this brings me to the ne xt thing the Nagua l asked me to tell you. He said that because you were empty he had to gather your second attention, your attention of the nagua l, in a way different than our s. We gathered that attention through dreaming and you did it with his pow er plan ts. The Nagua l said that his pow er plants gathered the menacing side of your second attention in one clum p, and that’s the shape that came out of your head. He said that that’s what happe ns to sorcerers when they are given pow er plants. If they don’ t die, the pow er plants spin their second attention into that awful shape that com es out of their heads. “Now we’re com ing to what he wanted you to do. He said that you must change directions now and begin gathering your second attention in anot her way, more like us. You can’t keep on the path of know ledge unl ess you balance your second attention. So far, that attention of yo urs has been riding on the Nagua l’s pow er, but now you are alone . That’s what he wanted me to tell you. ”"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" 277 “How do I balance my second attentio n?” “You have to do dreaming the way we do it.

That’s what you chos e last night when you decided to go with us.” “Coul d that shape com e out of me at any time?” “No. The Nagua l said that it won’ t com e out again unt il you’ re as old as he is. Your nagua l has alr eady com e out as many times as was needed. The Nagua l and Genaro have seen to that. They used to tease it out of you. The Nagua l told me that som etimes you were a hair away from dyi ng because your second attention is very indul ging. He said that onc e you e ven scared him; your nagua l attacked him and he had to sing to it to calm it dow n. But the worst thing happe ned to you in Mexico City; there he pus hed you one day and you went into an office and in that office you went through the crack between the worlds. He intende d onl y to dispel your attention of the tona l; you were worried sick ove r som e stupi d thing. But when he shove d you, your whol e tona l shrunk and your entire being went through the crack. He had a hellish time findi ng you . He told me that for a mo ment he thought you had gone farther than he coul d reach. But then he saw you roaming around aimlessly and he brought you back. He told me that you went through the crack around ten in the morning. So, on that day, ten in the morning became your new time.” “My new time for what?” “For everything. If you remain a man you will die around that time. If you becom e a sorcerer you will leave this world around that time. “Eligio also went on a different path, a path none of us kne w about .

By the time Eligio had to jum p, his second attention had already been in that other world.

If you coul d conque r them you’ d be a great warrior.” I wanted her to tell me more on the subj ect. She put her ha nd on my writing pad and said that we had a terribly bus y day ahead of us and we needed to store energy in order to withstand it.

We sat there for about half an hour . In that time we repeated the exercise count less times. I intende d to make a mark on my pad for each time but la Gorda very casually pus hed my pad out of reach. Lidia sudde nly stood up, mum bling som ething uni ntelligible. La Gorda leaned ove r to me and whispered that the Genaros were com ing up the road. I strained to look but there was no one in sight .

The Genaros had been visible just for Lidia because she had been gazing at the same time she had been bathing her eyes. I was no t sure what la Gorda had meant and asked her to expl ain. “We are gazers,” she said. “Just like your self. We are all the same. There is no need to deny that you’ re a gazer.

He made a large, heavy bundl e with all kinds of items; he even put Pablito’s radio in it. He then gave the bundl e to Josefina to carry and put a heavy table on Pablito’s shoul ders and they all started hiking. He made all of them take tu rns carrying the bundl e and the table as they hiked nearly forty miles to that high, desolate place. When they arrived there, the Nagua l made Pablito set the table in the very center of the valley. Then he asked Josefina to arrange the cont ents of the bund le on the table. When the table was filled, he expl ained to them the difference between the tona l and the nagua l, in the same terms he had expl ained it to me in a restaurant in Mexico City, except that in their case his example was infinitely more graphi c. He told them that the tona l was the order that we are aware of in our daily world and also the persona l order that we carry through life on our shoul ders, like they had carried that table and the bundl e. The persona l tona l of each of us was like the table in that valley, a tiny island filled with the things we are familiar with. The nagua l, on the other hand, was the inexpl icable sour ce that held that table in place and was like the vastness of that deserted valley. He told them that sorcerers were obl igat ed to watch their tona ls from a distance in order to have a better grasp of what was really around them. He made them walk to a ridge from where they coul d view the whol e area. From there the table was hardly visible. He then made them go back to the table and had them all loom ove r it in order to show that an average man doe s not have the grasp that a sorcerer has because an average man is right on top of his table, hol ding ont o every item on it. He then made each of them, one at a time, casually look at t he obj ects on the table, and tested their recall by taking som ething and hiding it, to see if they had been attentive. All of them passed the test with flying colors. He poi nted out to them that their ability to remember so easily the items on that table w as due to the"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 284 fact that all of them had develope d their attention of the tona l, or their attention ove r the table. He next asked them to look casually at everything that was on the ground unde rneath the table, and tested their recall by removi ng the rocks, twigs or whatever else was there. None of them coul d remember what they had seen unde r the table. The Nagua l then swept everything off the top of the table and made each of them, one at a time, lie across it on their stomachs and carefully examine the gro und unde rneath. He expl ained to them that for a sorcerer the nagua l was the area just unde rneath the table. Since it was unt hinka ble to tackle the immensity of the nagua l, as exemplified by that vast, desolate place, sorcerers took as their dom ain of activ ity the area directly below the island of the tona l, as graphi cally show n by what was unde rneath that table. That area was the dom ain of what he called the second attention, or the attention of the nagua l, or the attention unde r the table. That attention w as reached onl y after warriors had swept the top of their tables clean. He said that reaching the second attention made the two attentions into a singl e uni t, and that uni t was the totality of one self. La Gorda said that his demons tration was so clear to h er that she unde rstood at onc e why the Nagua l had made her clean her ow n life, sweep her island of the tona l, as he had called it. She felt that she had inde ed been fortuna te in having follow ed every sugge stion that he had put to her. She was still a long way from uni fying her two attentions , but her diligence had resulted in an impeccable life, which was, as he had assured her, the onl y way for her to lose her hum an form. Losing the hum an form was the essential requi rement for uni fying the two attentions . “The attention unde r the table is the key to everything sorcerers do, ” she went on. “In order to reach that attention the Nagua l and Genaro taught us"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 285 dreaming, and you were taught about pow er plants. I don’ t know what they did to you to teach you how to t rap your second attention with pow er plants, but to teach us how to do dreaming, the Nagua l taught us gazing. He never told us what he was really doi ng to us. He just taught us to gaze. We never kne w that gazing was the way to trap our second attention. We thought gazing was just for fun. That was not so. Dreamers have to be gazers before they can trap their second attention. “The first thing the Nagua l did was to put a dry leaf on the ground and make me look at it for hour s. Every day he broug ht a leaf and put it in front of me. At first I thoug ht that it was the same leaf that he saved from day to day, but then I not iced that leaves are different. The Nagua l said that when we realized that, we are not looki ng anym ore, but gazing. “Then he put stacks of dry leaves in front of me. He told me to scramble them with my left hand and feel them as I gazed at them. A dreamer move s the leaves in spirals, gazes at them and then dreams of the designs that the leaves make. The Nagua l said that dreamers can cons ider the mselves as having mastered leaf gazing when they dream the designs of the leaves first and then find thos e same designs the next day in their pile of dry leaves. “The Nagua l said that gazing at leaves fortifies the second attention. If you gaze at a pile o f leaves for hour s, as he used to make me do, your thought s get qui et. Without thoug hts the attention of the tona l wanes and sudde nly your second attention hooks ont o the leaves and the leaves becom e som ething else. The Nagua l called the mom ent when the se cond attention hooks ont o som ething stoppi ng the world. And that is correct, the world stops . For this reason there shoul d always be som eone around when you gaze. We never know about the qui rks of ou r second attention. Since we have never used it, we have to becom e familiar with it before we coul d venture into gazing alone ."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 286 “The difficulty in gazing is to learn to qui et dow n the thought s. The Nagua l said that he preferred to teach us how to do that with a pile of leaves because we coul d get all the leaves w e needed any time we wanted to gaze. But anyt hing else woul d do the same job. “Once you can stop the world you are a gazer. And since the onl y way of stoppi ng the world is by trying, the Nagua l made all of us gaze at dry leaves for years and years. I think it’s the best way to reach our second attention. “He com bined gazing at dry leaves and looki ng for ou r hands in dreaming. It took me about a year to find my hands , and four years to stop the world. The Nagua l said that onc e you have trappe d your second at tention with dry leaves, you do gazing and dreaming to enlarge it. And that’s all there is to gazing. ” “You make it sound so simple, Gorda.” “Everything the Toltecs do is very simple. The Nagua l said that all we needed to do in order to trap our second att ention was to try and try. All of us stoppe d the world by gazing at dry leaves. You and Eligio were different. You your self did it with pow er plants, but I don’ t know what path the Nagua l follow ed with Eligio. He never wanted to tell me. He told me about y ou because we have the same task.” I mentione d that I had written in my not es that I had had the first com plete awareness of having stoppe d the world onl y a few days before. She laughe d. “You stoppe d the world before any of us,” she said. “What do you thin k you did when you took all thos e pow er plants? You’ ve never done it by gazing like we did, that’s all.” “Was the pile of dry leaves the onl y thing the Nagua l made you gaze at?” “Once dreamers know how to stop the world, they can gaze at other things ; and finally when the dreamers lose their form altoge ther, they can gaze at anyt hing."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" 287 I do that. I can go into anyt hing. He made us follow a certain order in gazing, though. “First we gazed at small plants. The Nagua l warned us that small plants are very dange rous . Their pow er is conc entrated; they have a very intense light and they feel when dreamers are gazing at them; they immediately move their light and shoot it at the gazer. Dreamers have to choose one kind of plant to gaze at. “Next we gazed at trees. Dr eamers also have a particular kind of tree to gaze at. In this respect you and I are the same; both of us are eucalypt us gazers.” By the look on my face she must have gue ssed my next que stion. “The Nagua l said that with his smoke you coul d very easily get your second attention to work,” she went on. “You focused your attention lots of times on the Nagua l’s predilection, the crow s. He said that onc e, your second attention focused so perfectly on a crow that it flew away, like a crow flies, to the onl y eucaly ptus tree that was around. ” For years I had dw elled upon that expe rience. I coul d not regard it in any other way except as an inconc eivably com plex hypnot ic state, brought about by the psychot ropi c mushroom s cont ained in don Juan’s smoki ng mixture in conj u nction with his expe rtise as a manipul ator of behavior. He sugge sted a perceptual catharsis in me, that of turning into a crow and perceiving the world as a crow . The result was that I perceived the world in a manne r that coul d not have pos sibly been part of my inve ntory of past expe riences. La Gorda’s expl anation som ehow had simplified everything. She said that the Nagua l next made them gaze at movi ng, living creatures. He told them that small insects were by far the best subj ect. Their mobi lity made them innoc uous to the gazer, the oppos ite of plants which drew their ligh t directly from the earth."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" 288 The next step was to gaze at rocks. She said that rocks were very old and pow erful and had a specific light which was rather greenish in cont rast with the white light of plants and the yellow ish light of mobi le, living beings . Rocks did not ope n up easily to gazers, but it was worthw hile for gazers to persist because rocks had special secrets conc ealed in their core, secrets that coul d aid sorcerers in their “drea ming. ” “What are the things that rocks reveal to you? ” I asked. “When I gaze into the very core of a rock,” she said, “I always catch a whiff of a special scent prope r to that rock. When I roam around in my dreaming, I know where I am because I’m gui ded b y those scents.” She said that the time of the day was an impor tant factor in tree and rock gazing. In the early morning trees and rocks were stiff and their light was faint. Around noon was when they were at their best, and gazing at that time was done fo r bor row ing their ligh t and pow er. In the late afternoon and early evening trees and rocks were qui et and sad, especially trees. La Gorda said that at that hour trees gave the feeling that they were gazing back at the gazer. A second series in the order of gazing was to gaze at cyclic phe nom ena: rain and fog. She said that gazers can focus their second attention on the rain itself and move with it, or focus it on the backgr ound and use the rain as a magni fying glass of sorts to reveal hidde n features. Place s of pow er or places to be avoi ded are found by gazing through rain. Places of po wer are yellow ish and places to be avoi ded are intensely green. La Gorda said that fog was unque stiona bly the most mysterious thing on earth for a gazer and that it coul d be u sed in the same two ways that rain was used. But it did not easily yield to wom en, and even after she had lost her hum an form, it remained una ttainable to her. She said that the Nagua l onc e made her “see” a green mist at the head of a fog bank and told her that was the second attention of a fog"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" 289 gazer who lived in the mount ains where she and the Nagua l were, and that he was movi ng with the fog. She adde d that fog was used to unc ove r the ghos ts of things that were no longe r there and that the true feat of fog gazers was to let their second attention go into whatever their gazing was revealing to them. I told her that onc e while I was with don Juan I had seen a bridge formed out of a fog bank. I was agha st at the clarity and precise detail of that bridge . To me it was more than real. The scene was so intense and vivid that I had been incapable of forgetting it. Don Juan’s com ments had been that I woul d have to cross that bridge som eday. “I know about it,” she said. “The Nagua l told me that som eday when you have mastery ove r your second attention yo u’ll cross that bridge with that attention, the same way you flew like a crow with that attention. He said that if you becom e a sorcerer, a bridge will form for you out of the fog and you will cross it and disappe ar fr om this world forever. Just like he himself has done .” “Did he disappe ar like that, ove r a bridge ?” “Not ove r a bridge . But you witnessed how he and Genaro steppe d into the crack between the worlds in front of yo ur very eyes. Nestor said that onl y Genaro w aved his hand to say goodbye the last time you saw them; the Nagua l did not wave because he was ope ning the crack. The Nagua l told me that when the second attention has to be called upon to assemble itself, all that is needed is the motion of ope ning that door . That’s the secret of the Toltec dreamers onc e they are formless.” I wanted to ask her about don Juan and don Genaro steppi ng through that crack. She made me stop with a light touc h of her hand on my mout h. She said that anot her series was distance an d cloud gazing. In bot h, the effort of gazers was to let their second attention go to the place they were gazing at. Thus , they cove red great distances or rode on clouds . In the case of cloud gazing, the Nagua l never permitted them to gaze at thunde rheads . He told them"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" 290 that they had to be formless before they coul d attempt that feat, and that they coul d not onl y ride on a thunde rhead but on a thu nde rbol t itself. La Gorda laughe d and asked me to gue ss who woul d be daring and crazy enough actually to try gaz ing at thunde rheads. I coul d think of no one else but Josefina. La Gorda said that Josefina tried gazing at thunde rheads every time she coul d when the Nagua l was away, unt il one day a thunde rbol t nearly killed her. “Genaro was a thunde rbol t sorcerer,” she went on. “His first two appr entices, Benigno and Nestor, were singl ed out for him by his friend the thunde r. He said that he was looki ng for plants in a very remote area where the Indi ans are very private and don’ t like visitors of any kind. They had given Genaro permission to be on their land since he spoke their langua ge. Genaro was picking som e plants when it began to rain. There were som e hous es around but the peopl e were unf riendly and he didn’ t want to bot her them; he was about to crawl into a hol e wh en he saw a young man com ing do wn the road riding a bicycle heavily laden with goods . It was Benigno, the man from the tow n, who dealt with thos e Indi ans. His bicycle got stuck in the mud and right there a thunde rbol t struck him. Genaro thought that he had been killed. Peopl e in the hous es had seen what happe ned and came out . Benigno was more scared than hur t, but his bicycle and all his merchandi se were ruined. Genaro stayed with him for a week and cured him. “Almost the same thing happe ned to Nestor. He u sed to buy medicinal plants from Genaro, and one day he follow ed him into the mount ains to see where he picked his plants, so he woul dn’ t have to pay for them anym ore. Genaro went very far into the moun tains on pur pos e; he intended to make Nestor get lost. It wasn’t raining but there were thunde rbo lts, and sudde nly a thunde rbol t struck the ground and ran ove r the dry ground like a snake. It ran right between Nestor’s legs and hit a rock ten yards away."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" 291 “Genaro said that the bol t had charred the inside of Ne stor’s legs.

Men have to be hooke d. Wom en don’ t need that. Wom en go freely into anyt hing. That’s their pow er and at the same time their drawback. Men have to be led and wom en have to be cont ained.” She giggl ed and said that no doubt she had a lot of maleness in her, for she needed to be led, and that I must have a lot of femaleness in me, for I needed to be cont ained. The last series was fire, smoke and shadow gazing. She said that for a gazer, fire is not bright bu t black, and so is smoke . Shadow s, on the other hand, are brilliant and have color and move ment in them. There were two m ore things that were kept separate, star and water gazing. Stargazing was done by sorcerers who have lost their hum an form. She said that she had fared very well at stargazing, but coul d not handl e gazing at water, especially runni ng water, which was used by formless sorcerers to gather their second attention and transpor t it to anypl ace they needed to go. “All of us are terrified of water,” she went on. “A river gathers the second attention and takes it away and there is no way of stoppi ng. The Nagua l told me about your feats of water gazing. But he also told me that one time you nearly disintegrated in the water of a shallow river and that you can’t even take a bath now .” Don Juan had made me stare at the water of an irrigation ditch behind his hous e vario us times while he had me unde r the influence of his smoki ng mixture.

She came back a mom ent later with a small, thick, round cushion made out of the same natural fiber used in making nets. Without saying a word she led me again to the front por ch. She said that she had made that cushion herself for her com fort when she was learning to gaze, because the pos ition of the body was of great impo rtance while one was gazing. One had to sit on the ground on a soft mat of leaves , or on a cushion made out of natural fibers. The back had to be proppe d against a tree, or a stum p, or a flat rock.

She hope d that by gazing at it I woul d get the necessary energy to round up my second attention. She sat dow n very close to me , to my left, and began giving me instructions . Almost in a whisper she told me to keep my eyelids half closed and stare at the place where two enor mous round hills conve rged. There was a narrow , steep water canyon there. She said that that particular gazi ng cons isted of four separate actions . The first one was to use the brim of my hat as a visor to shade off the excessive glare from the sun and allow onl y a minimal amount of light to com e to my eyes; then to halfclose my eyelids; the third step was to sus tain the ope ning of my eyelids in order to maintain a uni form flow of light ; and the fou rth step was to distingui sh the water canyon in the backgr ound throug h the mesh of light fibers on my eyelashes. I coul d not follow her instructions at first. The sun w as high ove r the hor izon and I had to tilt my head back. I tippe d my hat unt il I had blocked off most of the glare with the brim. That seemed to be all that was needed. As soon as I half closed my eyes, a bit of light that appe ared as if it were com ing fr om the tip of my hat literally expl oded on my eyelashes, which were acting as a filter that created a web of light . I kept my eyelids half closed and played with the web of light for a mom ent unt il I coul d distingu ish the dark, vertical out line of the wate r canyon in the backgr ound. La Gorda told me then to gaze at the middl e part of the canyon unt il I coul d spot a very dark brow n blotch. She said that it was a hol e in the canyon which was not there for the eye that looks , but onl y for the eye that “sees.” She warned me that I had to exercise my cont rol as soon as I had isolated that blotch, so that it woul d not pul l me tow ard it. Rather, I was suppos ed to zoom in on it and gaze into it. She sugge sted that the mom ent I found the hol e I shoul d press my shoul d ers on hers to let her know .

It was in my field of perception onl y if I kept the four actions unde r cont rol. I remembered then that don Jua n had enga ged me count less times in a similar activity. He used to hang a small piece of cloth from a low branch of a bus h, which was strategically located to be in line with specific geologi cal formations in the mount ains in the backgr ound, such as water canyons or slope s. By making me sit about fifty feet away from that piece of cloth, and having me stare through the low branches of the bus h where the cloth hung, he used to create a special perceptual effect in me. The piece of cloth, which was always a s hade darker than the geologi cal formation I was staring at, seemed to be at first a feature of that formation. The idea was to let my perception play witho ut analyzing it. I failed every time because I was thor oughl y incapable of suspendi ng judgm ent, and m y mind always entered into som e rationa l speculation about the mechanics of my pha ntom perception. This time I felt no need whatsoever for speculations . La Gorda was not an impos ing figur e that I unc ons cious ly needed to fight , as don Juan had obvi ous ly bee n to me.

La Gorda said that I was doi ng distance gazing and for that it was necessary to breathe the way she had r ecom mende d. She urged me to start all ove r again. She said that the Nagua l used to make them sit for entire days roundi ng up their second attention by gazing at that spot . He cautione d them repeatedly abou t the dange r of being engul fed because of the jolt the body suffered. It took me about an hour of gazing to do what she had delineated. To zoom in on the brow n spot and gaze into it meant that the brow n patch in my field of perception ligh tened up qui te sudde nly. As it became clearer I realized that som et hing in me was performing an impos sible act.

In a matter of seconds the conc entration of my gazing had been thor oughl y dissipated. La Gorda laughe d and said that she unde rstood wh y I had caused the Nagua l such an intense conc ern. She had seen for herself that I indul ged beyon d my limits. She sat against the pol e next to me and said that she and the little sisters were goi ng to gaze into the Nagua l’s pow er place. She then made a pie rcing birdcall. A mom ent later the little sisters came out of the hous e and sat dow n to gaze with her. Their gazing mastery was obvi ous . Their bodi es acqui red a strange rigidity. They did not seem to be breathing at all. Their stillness was so cont agious that I caught myself half closing my eyes and staring into the hills. Gazing had been a true revelation to me. In performing it I had corrobo rated som e impor tant issues of don Juan’s teachings . La Gorda had delineated the task in a definitely vague manne r. “To zoom in on it” was more a com mand than a description of a process, and yet it was a description, provi ding that one essential requi rement had been fulfilled; don Juan had called that requi rement stopp ing the internal dialog ue. From la Gorda’s statemen ts about gazing it was obvi ous to me that the effect don Juan had been after in making them gaze was to teach them to stop the internal dialogue . La Gorda had expressed it as “qui eting dow n the thought s.” Don Juan had taught me to do that very same thing, although he had made me follow the oppos ite path; instead of teaching me to focus my view, as gazers did, he taught me to ope n it, to flood my awareness by not focusing my sight on anyt hing. I had to sort of feel with my eyes everything in the 180 degree range in front of me, while I kept my eyes unf ocused just above the line of the hor izon. It was very difficult for me to gaze, because it entailed reversing that training. As I tried to gaze, my tende ncy was to ope n up. The effort of keeping that"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" 297 tende ncy in check, how ever, made me shut off my thou ght s. Once I had turned off my internal dialogue , it was not difficult to gaze as la Gorda had prescribed. Don Juan had asserted time and time again that the essential feature of his sorcery was shut ting off the i nternal dialog ue. In terms of the expl anation la Gorda had given me about the two realms of attention, stoppi ng the internal dialogue was an ope rationa l way of describing the act of disenga ging the attention of the tona l. Don Juan had also said that onc e we stop our internal dialogue we also stop the world. That was an ope rationa l description of the inconc eivable process of focusing our second attention. He had said that som e part of us is always kept unde r lock and key because we are afraid of it, and tha t to our reason, that part of us was like an insane relative that we keep locked in a dunge on. That part was, in la Gorda’s terms, our second attention, and when it finally coul d focus on som ething the world stoppe d. Since we, as average men, know onl y the attention of the tona l, it is not too farfetched to say that onc e that attention is canceled, the world inde ed has to stop. The focusing of our wild, unt rained second attention has to be, perforce, terrifying. Don Juan was right in saying that the onl y w ay to keep that insane relative from bu rsting in on us was by shielding our selves with our endl ess internal dialogue .

For him, to have com passion meant that you wished the other person to be like you, to be in your shoe s, and you lent a hand just for that pur pos e. You did that to Pablito.

In fact, to his unde rs tandi ng, every effort to help on our part was an arbitrary act gui ded by our ow n selfinterest alone . One day when I was with him in the city, I picked up a snail that was in the middl e of the sidewalk and tucked it safely unde r som e vines. I was sure that if I had left it in the middl e of the sidewalk, peopl e woul d soone r or later have steppe d on it. I thought that by movi ng it to a safe place I had saved it. Don Juan poi nted out that my assum ption was a careless one , because I had not taken into cons iderat ion two impor tant pos sibilities. One was that the snail might have been escaping a sure death by poison unde r the leaves of the vine, and the other pos sibility was that the snail had enough persona l pow er to cross the sidewalk. By interfering I had not sav ed the snail but onl y made it lose whatever it had so painfully gained. I wanted, of cour se, to put the snail back where I had found it, but he did not let me. He said that it was the snail’s fate that an idiot crossed its path and made it lose its mom entu m. If I left it where I had put it, it might be able again to gather enough pow er to go wherever it was goi ng. I thought I had unde rstood his poi nt. Obvi ously I had onl y given him a shallow agreement. The hardest thing for me was to let others be. I told t hem the story. La Gorda patted my back. “We’re all pretty bad,” she said. “All five of us are awful peopl e who don’ t want to unde rstand. I’ve got ten rid of most of my ugl y side, but not all of it yet. We are rather slow , and in com parison to the Genaros we are gloom y and dom ineering.

I did, and all of them laughe d like children. We remained silent for a long time. “I’m getting now to the end of what I had to tell you, ” la Gorda said all of a sudde n. She made all of us stand up. She said that they were goi ng to show me the Toltec warrior’s pow er stand. Lidia stood by my right side, facing me. She grabbe d my hand with her righ t hand, palm to palm, but without interlocking the finge rs. Then she h ooke d my arm righ t above the elbow with her left arm and held me tight ly against her chest. Josefina did exactly the same thing on my left side. Rosa stood face to face with me and hooke d her arms unde r my armpits and grabbe d my shoul ders. La Gorda came f rom behind me and embraced me at my waist, interlocking her finge rs ove r my navel. All of us were about the same height and they coul d press their heads against my head. La Gorda spoke very softly behind my left ear, but loud enough for all of us to hear h er.

She expl ained that the particular formation which we were in was a Toltec pow er arrange ment. I was at that mom ent the cent er and bindi ng force of the fou r corners of the world.

She said that the natural pos ition of every warrior was to face the nor th, since he had to hol d the weapon, the east, in his right hand. But the direction that we our selves had to face was the sout h, slight ly tow ard the east; therefore, the act of pow er that the Nagua l had left for us to perform was to change directions . She reminde d me that one of the first thi ng s that the Nagua l had done to us was to turn our eyes to face the sout heast. That had been the way he had enticed our second attention to perform the feat which we were goi ng to attempt then. There were two alternatives to that feat. One was for all of u s to turn around to face the sout h, using me as an axis, and in so doi ng change around the basic value and func tion of all of them. Lidia woul d be the west, Josefina, the east, Rosa, the sout h and she, the nor th. The other alternative was for us to change our direction and face the sout h but without turning arou nd. That was the alternative of pow er, and it entailed put ting on out second face. I told la Gorda that I did not unde rstand what our second face was. She said that she had been entrusted by the Nag ual to try getting the second attention of all of us bundl ed up toge ther, and that every Toltec warrior had two faces and faced two oppos ite directions. The second face was the second attention. La Gorda sudde nly released her grip. All the others did the s ame. She sat dow n again and motione d me to sit by her. The little sisters remained standi ng. La Gorda asked me if everything was clear to me. It was, and at the same time it was not . Before I had time to formulate a que stion, she blurted out that one of t he last things the Nagua l had entrusted her to tell me was that I had to change my direction by sum ming up my second attention toge ther with theirs, and put on my pow er face to see what was behind me."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" 305 La Gorda stood up and motione d me to follow her.

My eyes itched terribly; I wanted to rub them, but Lidia and Josefina held my arms tight ly. We stayed in that pos ition for a very long time. My fatigue was unbe arable and finally I slum ped.

The harder I tried, the harder they held me. That convi nced me that la Gorda had tricked me and ha d finally led me into a death trap. But cont rary to the others la Gorda had been an impeccable player. The thought that she had played an impeccable hand made me feel better. At one poi nt I did not care to struggl e any longe r. I became curious about the mo ment of my death, which I believed was imminent, and I let go of myself. I expe rienced then an une qua led joy, an exube rance that I was sure was the herald of my end, if not my death itself. I pul led Lidia and Josefina even closer to me. At that mom ent la G orda was in front of me. I did not mind that she was breathing in my mout h; in fact I was surprised that she stoppe d then.

The Genaros were drenching us with buc kets of water. I sprang up. Either the cold water or the extravagant expe rience I had just been through had invi gorated me.

La Gorda said that the Nagua l had onc e poi nted out to me a very special red insect, in the mount ains of his hom eland. She asked me if I remembered it. I did remember it. Years before don Juan had taken me to an area unknow n to me, in the mount ains of nor thern Mexico. With extreme care he show ed me som e round insects, the size of a ladybug. Their backs were brilliantly red. I wanted to get dow n on the gr ound and examine them, but he woul d not let me. He told me that I shoul d watch them, without staring, unt il I had memorized their shape, because I was suppos ed to remember them always. He then expl ained som e intricate details of their behavior, making it s ound like a metaphor . He was telling me about the arbitrary impo rtance of our most cherished mores. He poi nted out som e alleged mores of thos e insects and pitted them against our s. The com parison made the impor tance of ou r beliefs look ridiculous . “Just be fore he and Genaro left,” la Gorda went on, “the Nagua l took me to that place in the mount ains where thos e little bugs lived. I had already been there onc e, and so had everyone else. The Nagua l made sure that all of us kne w thos e little creatures, although he never let us gaze at them. “While I was there with him he told me what to do with you and what I shoul d tell you. I’ve already told you most of what he asked me to, except for this last thing. It has to do with what you’ ve been asking everybody about : Where are the Nagua l and Genaro? Now I’ll tell you exactly where they are. The Nagua l said"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":" 315 that you will unde rstand this better than any of us. None of us has ever seen the gua rdian. None of us has ever been in that yellow sulfur world where he lives. You are the onl y one among us who has. The Nagua l said that he follow ed you into that world when you focused you r second attention on the gua rdian. He intende d to go there with you, perhaps forever, if you wou ld’ve been strong enough to pass. It was then that he first found out about the world of thos e little red bugs . He said that their world was the most beautiful and perfect thing one coul d imagine. So, when it was time for him and Genaro to leave this world, they gathered all their second attention and foc used it on that world. Then the Nagua l ope ned the crack, as you your self witnessed, and they slippe d through it into that world, where they are waiting for us to join them som eday. The Nagua l and Genaro liked beauty. They went there for their sheer enjoym ent.” She looke d at me. I had not hing to say. She had been right in saying that pow er had to time her revelation perfectly if it were goi ng to be effective. I felt an angui sh I coul d not expr ess. It was as if I wanted to weep and yet I was not sad or melan chol y. I longe d for som ething inexp ressible, but that longi ng was not mine. Like so many of the feelings and sensations I had had since my arrival, it was alien to me. Nestor’s assertions about Eligio came to my mind. I told la Gorda what he had said, and she asked me to narrate to them the visions of my jour ney between the tona l and the nagua l which I had had upon jum ping into the abys s. When I finished they all seemed fright ened. La Gorda immediately isolated my vision of the dom e. “The Nagua l told us tha t our second attention woul d som eday focus on that dom e,” she said. “That day we will be all second attention, just like the Nagua l and Genaro are, and that day we will join them.” “Do you mean, Gorda, that we will go as we are?” I asked."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":" 316 “Yes, we will go as we are. The body is the first attention, the attention of the tona l. When it becom es the second attention, it simply goe s into the other world. Jum ping into the abys s gathered all your second attention for a while. But Eligio was stronge r and his second attention was fixed by that jum p. That’s what happe ned to him and he was just like all of us. But there is no way of telling where he is. Even the Nagua l himself didn’ t know . But if he is som eplace he is in that dom e. Or he is bounc ing from vision to vis ion, perhaps for a whol e eternity.” La Gorda said that in my jour ney between the tona l and the nagua l I had corrobo rated on a grand scale the pos sibility that our whol e being becom es all second attention, and on a much smaller scale when I got all of them lost in the world of that attention, earlier that day, and also when she transpor ted us half a mile in order to flee from the allies. She adde d that the probl em the Nagua l had left for us as a challenge was whether or not we woul d be capable of developi ng our will, or the pow er of our second attention to focus inde finitely on anyt hing we wanted. We were qui et for a while. It seemed that it was time for me to leave, but I coul d not move . The thought of Eligio’s fate had paralyzed me. Whether he had made it t o the dom e of our rende zvous , or whether he had got ten caught in the tremendu m, the image of his jour ney was madde ning. It took no effort at all for me to envi sion it, for I had the expe rience of my ow n jour ney. The other world, which don Juan had referred to practically since the mom ent we met, had always been a metaphor , an obs cure way of labeling som e perceptual distortion, or at best a way of talking about som e unde finable state of being. Even though don Juan had made me perceive inde scribable features of the world, I coul d not cons ider my expe riences to be anyt hing beyond a play on my perception, a directed mirage of sorts that he had managed to make me unde rgo, either by means of psychot ropi c plants, or by means I coul d not deduc e rationa lly."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":" 317 Every ti me that had happe ned. I had shielded myself with the thought that the uni ty of the “me” I kne w and was familiar with had been onl y tempor arily displaced. Inevitably, as soon as that uni ty was restored, the world became again the sanctuary for my inv iolable , rationa l self. The scope that la Gorda had ope ned with her revelations was terrifying. She stood up and pul led me up off the bench. She said that I had to leave before the twilight set in. All of them walked with me to my car and we said goodbye . La Gor da gave me a last com mand. She told me that on my return I shoul d go directly to the Genaros’ hous e. “We don’ t want to see you unt il you know what to do, ” she said with a radiant smile. “But don’ t delay too long. ” The little sisters nodde d. “Thos e mount ain s are not goi ng to let us stay here much longe r,” she said, and with a subt le move ment of her chin she poi nted to the om inous , erode d hills across the valley. I asked her one more que stion. I wanted to know if she had any idea where the Nagua l and Genaro w oul d go after we had com pleted our rende zvous . She looke d up at the sky, raised her arms and made an inde scribable gesture with them to poi nt out that there was no limit to that vastness. "}]
