His father was a YaquiIndian from Sonora, Mexico, and his mother was presumably a Yuma Indian fromArizona. Don Juan lived in Arizona until he was ten years old. He was then takenby his father to Sonora, Mexico, where they were caught in the endemic [*endemic- a disease that is constantly present to a greater or lesser degree inpeople of a certain class or in people living in a particular location] Yaquiwars against the Mexicans. His father was killed, and as a ten-year-old child,don Juan ended up in Southern Mexico, where he grew up with relatives.At the age of twenty, he came in contact with a master sorcerer. His name wasJulian Osorio. He introduced don Juan into a lineage of sorcerers that wastwenty-five generations long.The nagual Julian was not an Indian at all, but the son of European immigrantsto Mexico. Don Juan related to me that the nagual Julian had been an actor, andthat he was a dashing person: a raconteur, [* raconteur- a person skilled intelling short accounts of incidents, especially biographical ones] a mime,adored by everybody, influential, commanding. In one of his theatrical tours tothe provinces, the actor Julian Osorio fell under the influence of anothernagual, Elias Ulloa, who transmitted to him the knowledge of his lineage ofsorcerers.Don Juan Matus, following the tradition of his lineage of shamans, taught somebodily movements which he called magical passes to his four disciples: TaishaAbelar, Florinda Donner-Grau, Carol Figgs, and me. He taught the passes to us inthe same spirit in which they had been taught for generations; with one notabledeparture: he eliminated the excessive ritual which had for generationssurrounded the teaching and performance of those magical passes.Don Juan's comments in this respect were that ritual had lost its impetus as newgenerations of practitioners became more interested in efficiency andfunctionalism. He recommended to me, however, that under no circumstances shouldI talk about the magical passes with any of his disciples or with people ingeneral. His reasons were that the magical passes pertained exclusively to eachperson, and that their effect was so shattering that it was better just topractice them without discussing them.Don Juan Matus taught me everything he knew about the sorcerers of his lineage.He stated, asserted, affirmed, and explained to me every nuance of hisknowledge. Therefore, everything I say about the magical passes is a directresult of his instruction.The magical passes were not invented. They were discovered by the shamans of donJuan's lineage who lived in Mexico in ancient times while they were inshamanistic states of heightened awareness. The discovery of the magical passeswas quite accidental. It began as very simple queries about the nature of anincredible sensation of well-being that those shamans experienced in thosestates of heightened awareness when they held certain bodily positions, or whenthey moved their limbs in some specific manner. Their sensation of well-beinghad been so intense that their drive to repeat those movements in their normalawareness became the focus of all their endeavors.By all appearances, they succeeded in their task, and found themselves thepossessors of a very complex series of movements that, when practiced, yieldedthem tremendous results in terms of mental and physical prowess. In fact, theresults of performing these movements were so dramatic that they called themmagical passes. They taught them for generations only to shaman initiates on apersonal basis following elaborate rituals and secret ceremonies.Don Juan Matus, in teaching the magical passes, departed radically fromtradition. Such a departure forced don Juan to reformulate the pragmatic goal ofthe magical passes. He presented this goal to me not so much as the enhancementof mental and physical balance, as it had been in the past, but as the practicalpossibility of redeploying energy. [* energy- awareness] He explained that sucha departure was due to the influence of the two naguals who had preceded him.It was the belief of the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage that there is aninherent amount of energy existing in each one of us; an amount which is notsubject to the onslaughts of outside forces for augmenting [* augmenting-enlarging or increasing] it or for decreasing it. They believed that thisquantity of energy was sufficient to accomplish something which those sorcerersdeemed to be the obsession of every man on Earth: breaking the parameters ofnormal perception.Don Juan Matus was convinced that our incapacity to break those parameters wasinduced by our culture and social milieu. [* milieu- the environmentalcondition] He maintained that our culture and social milieu deployed every bitof our inherent energy in fulfilling established behavioral patterns which don'tallow us to break those parameters of normal perception.\"Why in the world would I, or anyone else, want to break those parameters?\" Iasked don Juan on one occasion.\"Breaking those parameters is the unavoidable issue of mankind,\" he replied.\"Breaking them means the entrance into unthinkable worlds of a pragmatic valuein no way different from the value of our world of everyday life. Regardless ofwhether or not we accept this premise, we are obsessed with breaking thoseparameters, and we fail miserably at it; hence the profusion of drugs andstimulants and religious rituals and ceremonies among modern man.\"\"Why do you think we have failed so miserably, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Our failure to fulfill our subliminal wish,\" he said, \"is due to the fact thatwe tackle it in a helter-skelter way. Our tools are too crude: They areequivalent to trying to bring down a wall by ramming it with the head. Man neverconsiders this breakage in terms of energy. For sorcerers, success is determinedonly by the accessibility or the inaccessibility energy.\"Since it is impossible,\" he continued, \"to augment our inherent energy, theonly avenue open for the sorcerers of ancient Mexico was the redeployment ofthat inherent energy. For them, this process of redeployment began with themagical passes, and the way they affected the physical body.\"While imparting his instructions, Don Juan stressed in every possible way thefact that the enormous emphasis the shamans of his lineage had put on physicalprowess and mental well-being had lasted to the present day. I was able tocorroborate [* corroborate- support with evidence] the truth of his statementsby observing him and his fifteen sorcerer companions. Their superb physical andmental balance was the most obvious feature about them.I once asked him directly why sorcerers put so much stock in the physical sideof man: I had always thought that he himself was a spiritual man. Don Juan'sreply was a total surprise to me.\"Shamans are not spiritual at all,\" don Juan said. \"They are very practicalbeings. It is a well-known fact, however, that shamans are generally regarded aseccentric, or even insane. Perhaps that is what makes you think that they arespiritual.\"They seem insane because they are trying to explain things that cannot beadequately described with words. In the course of such futile attempts to givecomplete explanations that cannot be completed under any circumstances, theymust touch on matters outside the coherence of the average man. So of coursetheir explanations seem to be senseless.\"You need,\" he went on, \"a pliable body if you want physical prowess and levelheadedness. These are the two most important issues in the lives of shamansbecause they bring forth sobriety and pragmatism: [* pragmatism- the attributeof accepting the facts of life] the only indispensable requisites for enteringinto other realms of perception.\"To navigate in a genuine way in the unknown, requires an attitude of daring,but not one of recklessness. In order to establish a balance between audacity [*audacity- fearless daring] and recklessness, a sorcerer has to be extremelysober, cautious, skillful, and in superb physical condition.\"\"But why in superb physical condition, don Juan?\" I asked. \"Isn't the desire orthe will to journey into the unknown enough?\"\"Not in your pissy life!\" he replied rather brusquely. \"Just to conceive facingthe unknown- much less entering into it- requires guts of steel, and a body thatwould be capable of holding those guts. What would be the point of being gutsyif you didn't have mental alertness, physical prowess, and adequate muscles?\"The superb physical condition that don Juan had steadily advocated from thefirst day of our association- the product of the rigorous execution of themagical passes- was, by all indications, the first step toward the redeploymentof our inherent energy. This redeployment of energy was, in don Juan's view, themost crucial issue in the lives of shamans, as well as in the life of anyindividual.Redeployment of energy is a process which consists of transporting, from oneplace to another, energy which already exists within us. This energy has beendisplaced from centers of vitality in the body, which require that displacedenergy in order to bring forth a balance between mental alertness and physicalprowess.The shamans of don Juan's lineage were deeply engaged with the redeployment oftheir inherent energy. This involvement wasn't an intellectual endeavor; nor wasit the product of induction, nor deduction, nor logical conclusions. It was theresult of their ability to perceive energy as it flowed in the universe.\"Those sorcerers called this ability to perceive energy as it flowed in theuniverse 'seeing',\" don Juan explained to me. \"They described seeing as a stateof heightened awareness in which the human body is capable of perceiving energyas a flow; a current; a wind like vibration. To see energy as it flows in theuniverse is the product of a momentary halt of the system of interpretationproper to human beings.\"\"What is this system of interpretation, don Juan?\" I asked.\"The shamans of ancient Mexico found out,\" he replied, \"that every part of thehuman body is engaged, in one way or another, in turning this vibratory flowinto some form of sensory input. The sum total of this bombardment of sensoryinput is then, through usage, turned into the system of interpretation thatmakes human beings capable of perceiving the world the way they do.\"To make this system of interpretation come to a halt,\" he went on, \"was theresult of tremendous discipline on the part of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico.They called this halt 'seeing', and made it the cornerstone of their knowledge.To see energy as it flowed in the universe was, for them, an essential tool thatthey employed in making their classificatory schemes.For instance, they conceived the total universe available to the perception ofhuman beings as an onion like affair, consisting of thousands of layers. The sawthat the daily world of human beings is but one such layer. Consequently, theyalso saw that other layers are not only accessible to human perception, but arepart of man's natural heritage.\"Another issue of tremendous value in the knowledge of those sorcerers, an issuewhich was also a consequence of their capacity to see energy as it flowed in theuniverse, was the discovery of the human energetic configuration. This humanenergetic configuration was, for them, a conglomerate of energy fieldsagglutinated [* agglutinated- strung together] together by a vibratory forcethat bound those energy fields into a luminous ball of energy.For the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage, a human being has an oblong shape likean egg, or a round shape like a ball. Thus, they called them luminous eggs orluminous balls. This sphere of luminosity was considered by them to be our trueself- true in the sense that it is irreducible in terms of energy. It isirreducible because the totality of human resources are engaged in the act ofperceiving it directly as energy.Those shamans discovered that on the back face of this luminous ball there is apoint of greater brilliance. They figured out through their processes ofobserving energy directly that this point is key in the act of our turningenergy into sensory data, and then our interpreting it. For this reason, theycalled it the assemblage point, and deemed that perception is indeed assembledthere.They described the assemblage point as being located behind the shoulder blades,an arm's length away from them. They also found out that the assemblage pointfor the entire human race is located on the same spot, thus giving every humanbeing an entirely similar view of the world.A finding of tremendous value for them, and for shamans of succeedinggenerations, was that the location of the assemblage point on that spot is theresult of usage and socialization. For this reason, they considered it to be anarbitrary position which gives merely the illusion of being final andirreducible.A product of this illusion is the seemingly unshakable conviction of humanbeings that the world they deal with daily is the only world that exists, andthat its finality is undeniable.\"Believe me,\" don Juan said to me once, \"this sense of finality about the worldis a mere illusion. Due to the fact that it is never challenged, it stands asthe only possible view. To see energy as it flows in the universe is the toolfor challenging it.\"Through seeing, the sorcerers of my lineage arrived at the conclusion thatthere are indeed a staggering number of worlds available to man's perception.They described those worlds as being all-inclusive realms; realms where one canact and struggle. In other words, they are worlds where one can live and die, asin this world of everyday life.\" During the thirteen years of my association with him, don Juan taught me thebasic steps toward accomplishing this feat of seeing. I have discussed thosesteps in all of my previous writings, but never have I touched on the magicalpasses as a key point in this process.He taught me a great number of them. But along with that wealth of knowledge,don Juan also left me with the certainty that I was the last link of hislineage.Accepting that I was the last link of his lineage automatically implied for methe task of finding new ways to disseminate the knowledge of his lineage, sinceits continuity was no longer an issue.I need to clarify a very important point in this regard: Don Juan Matus had notbeen interested in teaching his knowledge to the masses. He had been interestedin perpetuating his lineage.His three other disciples and I were chosen, he said, by the spirit itself. Hehad no active part in those choices. He said we were the means to ensure hislineage's perpetuation. Therefore, he engaged himself in a titanic effort toteach us all he knew about sorcery, or shamanism, and about the development ofhis lineage.In the course of training me, he later came to realize that my energeticconfiguration was so vastly different from his own that it couldn't meananything else but the end of his line. I told him that I resented enormously hisinterpretation of whatever invisible difference existed between us. I didn'tlike the burden of being the last of his line, nor did I understand hisreasoning.\"The shamans of ancient Mexico,\" he said to me once, \"believed that choice, ashuman beings understand it, is the precondition of the cognitive world of man,but that it is only a benevolent interpretation of something which is found whenawareness ventures beyond the cushion of our world, a benevolent interpretationof acquiescence. [* acquiescence- acceptance without protest] Human beings arein the throes of forces that pull them every which way. The art of sorcerers isnot really to choose, but to be subtle enough to acquiesce.\"Sorcerers, although they seem to make nothing else but decisions, make nodecisions at all,\" he went on. \"I didn't decide to choose you, and I didn'tdecide that you would be the way you are. Since I couldn't choose to whom Iwould impart my knowledge, I had to accept whomever the spirit was offering me.And that person was you, and you are energetically capable only of ending, notof continuing.\"He maintained that the ending of his line had nothing to do with him or hisefforts, or with his success or failure as a sorcerer seeking total freedom. Heunderstood it as something that had to do with a choice exercised beyond thehuman level, not by beings or entities, but by the impersonal forces of theuniverse.Finally, I came to accept what don Juan called my fate. Accepting it put me faceto face with another issue that he referred to as locking the door when youleave. That is to say, I assumed the responsibility of deciding exactly what todo with everything he had taught me and carrying out my decision impeccably.First of all, I asked myself the crucial question of what to do with the magicalpasses: the facet of don Juan's knowledge most imbued with pragmatism andfunction. I decided to use the magical passes, and teach them to whoever wantedto learn them. My decision to end the secrecy that had surrounded them for anundetermined length of time was, naturally, the corollary of my total convictionthat I am indeed the end of don Juan's lineage.It became inconceivable to me that I should carry secrets which were not evenmine. To shroud the magical passes in secrecy was not my decision. It was mydecision, however, to end such a condition.I endeavored from then on to come up with a more generic form of each magicalpass; a form suitable to everyone. This resulted in a configuration of slightlymodified forms of each one of the magical passes. I have called this newconfiguration of movements Tensegrity; a term which belongs to architecture,where it means 'the property of skeleton structures that employ continuoustension members and discontinuous compression members in such a way that eachmember operates with the maximum efficiency and economy'.In order to explain what the magical passes of the sorcerers who lived in Mexicoin ancient times are, I would like to make a clarification: 'ancient times'meant, for don Juan, a time ten thousand years ago and beyond; a figure thatseems incongruous if examined from the point of view of the classificatoryschemes of modern scholars. When I confronted don Juan with the discrepancybetween his estimate and what I considered to be a more realistic one, heremained adamant in his conviction. He believed it to be a fact that people wholived in the New World ten thousand years ago were deeply concerned with mattersof the universe and perception that modern man has not even begun to fathom.Regardless of our differing chronological interpretations, the effectiveness ofthe magical passes is undeniable to me, and I feel obligated to elucidate [*elucidate- make clear and more understandable] the subject strictly followingthe manner in which it was presented to me. The directness of their effect on mehas had a deep influence on the way in which I deal with them. What I ampresenting in this work is an intimate reflection of that influence. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"Magical PassesThe first time don Juan talked to me at length about magical passes was when hemade a derogatory comment about my weight.\"You are way too chubby,\" he said, looking at me from head to toe shaking hishead in disapproval. \"You are one step from being fat. Wear and tear isbeginning to show in you. Like any other member of our race, you are developinga lump of fat on your neck, like a bull. It's time that you take seriously oneof the sorcerers' greatest findings: the magical passes.\"\"What magical passes are you talking about, don Juan?\" I asked. \"You nevermentioned this topic to me before. Or, if you have, it must have been so lightlythat I can't recall anything about it.\"\"Not only have I told you a great deal about magical passes,\" he said, \"you knowa great number of them already. I have been teaching them to you all along.\"As far as I was concerned, it wasn't true that he had taught me any magicalpasses all along. I protested vehemently.\"Don't be so passionate about defending your wonderful self,\" he joked, making aridiculous gesture of apology with his eyebrows. \"What I meant to say is thatyou imitate everything I do, so I have been cashing in on your imitationcapacity. I have shown you various magical passes, all along, and you havealways taken them to be my delight in cracking my joints. I like the way youinterpret them: cracking my joints! We are going to keep on referring to them inthat manner.\"I have shown you ten different ways of cracking my joints,\" he continued. \"Eachone of them is a magical pass that fits to perfection my body and yours. Youcould say that those ten magical passes are in your line and mine. They belongto us personally and individually, as they belonged to other sorcerers who werejust like the two of us in the twenty-five generations that preceded us.\"The magical passes don Juan was referring to, as he himself had said, were waysin which I thought he cracked his joints. He used to move his arms, legs, torso,and hips in specific ways, I thought, in order to create a maximum stretch ofhis muscles, bones, and ligaments. The result of these stretching movements,from my point of view, was a succession of cracking sounds which I alwaysthought that he was producing for my amazement and amusement. He, indeed, hadasked me time and time again to imitate him. In a challenging manner, he hadeven dared me to memorize the movements and repeat them at home until I couldget my joints to make cracking noises, just like his.I had never succeeded in reproducing the sounds, yet I had definitely butunwittingly learned all the movements. I know now that not achieving thatcracking sound was a blessing in disguise, because the muscles and tendons ofthe arms and back should never be stressed to that point. Don Juan was born witha facility to crack the joints of his arms and back, just as some people havethe facility to crack their knuckles.\"How did the old sorcerers invent those magical passes, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Nobody invented them,\" he said sternly. \"To think that they were inventedimplies instantly the intervention of the mind, and this is not the case when itcomes to those magical passes. They were, rather, discovered by the old shamans.I was told that it all began with the extraordinary sensation of well-being thatthose shamans experienced when they were in shamanistic states of heightenedawareness. They felt such tremendous, enthralling vigor that they struggled torepeat it in their hours of vigil.\"At first,\" don Juan explained to me once, \"those shamans believed that it was amood of well-being that heightened awareness created in general. Soon, theyfound out that not all the states of shamanistic heightened awareness which theyentered produced in them the same sensation of well-being. A more carefulscrutiny revealed to them that whenever that sensation of well-being occurred,they had always been engaged in some specific kind of bodily movement. Theyrealized that while they were in states of heightened awareness, their bodiesmoved involuntarily in certain ways, and that those certain ways were indeed thecause of that unusual sensation of physical and mental plenitude.\"Don Juan speculated that it had always appeared to him that the movements thatthe bodies of those shamans executed automatically in heightened awareness werea sort of hidden heritage of mankind; something that had been put in deepstorage to be revealed only to those who were looking for it. He portrayed thosesorcerers as deep-sea divers who, without knowing it, reclaimed it.Don Juan said that those sorcerers arduously [* arduously- in a mannercharacterized by toilsome effort to the point of exhaustion; especially physicaleffort] began to piece together some of the movements they remembered. Theirefforts paid off. They were capable of re-creating movements that had seemed tothem to be automatic reactions of the body in a state of heightened awareness.Encouraged by their success, they were capable of re-creating hundreds ofmovements which they performed without ever attempting to classify them into anunderstandable scheme. Their idea was that in heightened awareness, themovements happened spontaneously; and that there was a force that guided theireffect without the intervention of their volition. [* volition- the capabilityof conscious choice and decision and intention]Don Juan commented that the nature of the ancient sorcerers' findings always ledhim to believe that those sorcerers were extraordinary people because themovements that they discovered were never revealed in the same fashion to modernshamans who also entered into heightened awareness.He thought that perhaps this was because modern shamans had learned themovements beforehand in some fashion or another from their predecessors; orperhaps because the sorcerers of ancient times had more energetic mass.\"What do you mean, don Juan, that they had more energetic mass?\" I asked. \"Werethey bigger men?\"\"I don't think they were physically any bigger,\" he said, \"but energetically,they appeared to the eye of a seer as an oblong shape. They called themselvesluminous eggs. I have never seen a luminous egg in my life. All I have seen areluminous balls. It is presumable, then, that man has lost some energetic massover the generations.\"Don Juan explained to me that to a seer, the universe is composed of an infinitenumber of energy fields. They appear to the eye of the seer as luminousfilaments that shoot out every which way. Don Juan said that those filamentscrisscross through the luminous balls that human beings are, and that it wasreasonable to assume that if human beings were once oblong shapes, like eggs,they were much higher than a ball. Therefore, energy fields that touched humanbeings at the crown of the luminous egg are no longer touching them now thatthey are luminous balls. Don Juan felt that this meant to him a loss of energymass, which seemed to have been crucial for the purpose of reclaiming thathidden treasure: the magical passes.\"Why are the passes of the old shamans called magical passes, don Juan?\" I askedhim on one occasion.\"They are not just called magical passes,\" he said, \"they are magical! Theyproduce an effect that cannot be accounted for by means of ordinaryexplanations. These movements are not physical exercises or mere postures of thebody: They are real attempts at reaching an optimal state of being.\"The magic of the movements,\" he went on, \"is a subtle change that thepractitioners experience on executing them. It is an ephemeral [* ephemeral-lasting a very short time] quality that the movement brings to their physicaland mental states; a kind of shine; a light in the eyes. This subtle change is atouch of the spirit. It is as if the practitioners, through the movements,re-establish an unused link with the life force that sustains them.\"He further explained that another reason that the movements are called magicalpasses is that by means of practicing them, shamans are transported in terms ofperception to other states of being in which they can sense the world in anindescribable manner.\"Because of this quality, because of this magic,\" don Juan said to me, \"thepasses must be practiced not as exercises, but as a way of beckoning power.\"\"But can they be taken as physical movements, although they have never beentaken as such?\" I asked.\"You can practice them any way you wish,\" don Juan replied. \"The magical passesenhance awareness, regardless of how you take them. The intelligent thing wouldbe to take them as what they are: Magical passes that on being practiced leadthe practitioner to drop the mask of socialization.\"\"What is the mask of socialization?\" I asked.\"The veneer that all of us defend and die for,\" he said. \"The veneer we acquirein the world. The one that prevents us from reaching all our potential. The onethat makes us believe we are immortal. The intent of thousands of sorcererspermeates these movements. Executing them, even in a casual way, makes the mindcome to a halt.\"\"What do you mean that they make the mind come to a halt?\" I asked.\"Everything,\" he said, \"that we do in the world, we recognize and identify byconverting it into lines of similarity; lines of things that are strung togetherby purpose. For example, if I say to you fork, this immediately brings to yourmind the idea of spoon, knife, tablecloth, napkin, plate, cup and saucer, glassof wine, chili con carne, banquet, birthday, fiesta. You could certainly go onnaming things strung together by purpose, nearly forever. Everything we do isstrung like this. The strange part for sorcerers is that they see that all theselines of affinity, all these hues of things strung together by purpose, areassociated with man's idea that things are unchangeable and forever, like theword of God.\"\"I don't see, don Juan, why you bring the word of God into this elucidation. [*elucidation- an interpretation that removes obstacles to understanding] Whatdoes the word of God have to do with what you are trying to explain?\"\"Everything!\" he replied. \"It seems to be that in our minds, the entire universeis like the word of God: absolute and unchanging. This is the way we conductourselves. In the depths of our minds, there is a checking device that doesn'tpermit us to stop to examine that the word of God, as we accept it and believeit to be, pertains to a dead world. A live world, on the other hand, is inconstant flux. It moves. It changes. It reverses itself.\"The most abstract reason why the magical passes of the sorcerers of my lineageare magical,\" he went on, \"is that in practicing them, the body of thepractitioner realizes that everything, instead of being an unbroken chain ofobjects that have affinity for each other, is a current, a flux. And ifeverything in the universe is a flux or a current, that current can be stopped.A dam can be put on it, and in this manner its flux can be halted or deviated.\"Don Juan explained to me on one occasion the overall effect that the practice ofthe magical passes had on the sorcerers of his lineage, and correlated thiseffect with what would happen to modern practitioners.\"The sorcerers of my lineage,\" he said, \"were shocked half to death uponrealizing that practicing their magical passes brought about the halt of theotherwise uninterrupted flux of things. They constructed a series of metaphorsto describe this halt, and in their effort to explain it, or reconsider it, theyflubbed it. They lapsed into ritual and ceremony. They began to enact the act ofhalting the flux of things. They believed that if certain ceremonies and ritualswere focused on a definite aspect of their magical passes, the magical passesthemselves would beckon a specific result. Very soon, the number and complexityof their rituals and ceremonies became more encumbering than the number of theirmagical passes.\"It is very important,\" he went on, \"to focus the attention of the practitioneron some definite aspect of the magical passes. However, that fixation should belight, funny, and void of morbidity and grimness. They should be done for thehell of it without really expecting returns.\"He gave the example of one of his cohorts, a sorcerer by the name of SilvioManuel, whose delight and predilection was to adapt the magical passes of thesorcerers of ancient times to the steps of his modern dancing. Don Juandescribed Silvio Manuel as a superb acrobat and dancer who actually danced themagical passes.\"The nagual Elias Ulloa,\" don Juan continued, \"was the most prominent innovatorof my lineage. He was the one who threw all the ritual out the window, so tospeak, and practiced the magical passes exclusively for the purpose for whichthey were originally used at one time in the remote past; for the purpose ofredeploying energy.\"The nagud Julian Osorio, who came after him,\" don Juan continued, \"was the onewho gave ritual the final death blow. Since he was a bona fide professionalactor who at one time had made his living acting in the theater, he put enormousstock into what sorcerers called the shamanistic theater. He called it thetheater of infinity, and into it, he poured all the magical passes that wereavailable to him. Every movement of his characters was imbued to the gills withmagical passes. Not only that, but he turned the theater into a new avenue forteaching them. Between the nagual Julian, the actor of infinity, and SilvioManuel, the dancer of infinity, they had the whole thing pegged down. A new erawas on the horizon! The era of pure redeployment!\"Don Juan's explanation of redeployment was that human beings are perceived asconglomerates of energy fields; sealed energetic units that have definiteboundaries which don't permit the entrance or the exit of energy. Therefore, theenergy existing within that conglomerate of energy fields is all that each humanindividual can count on.\"The natural tendency of human beings,\" he said, \"is to push energy away fromthe centers of vitality, which are located: on the right side of the body at theedge of the rib cage on the area of the liver and gallbladder; on the left sideof the body, again, at the edge of the rib cage on the area of the pancreas andspleen; on the back directly behind the other two centers around the kidneys andabove them on the area of the adrenal glands; at the base of the neck on the Vspot made by the sternum and clavicle; and around the uterus and ovaries inwomen.\"\"How do human beings push this energy away, don Juan?\" I asked.\"By worrying,\" he replied. \"By succumbing to the stress of everyday life. Theduress of daily actions takes its toll on the body.\"\"And what happens to this energy, don Juan?\" I asked.\"It gathers on the periphery of the luminous ball,\" he said, \"sometimes to thepoint of making a thick bark like deposit. The magical passes relate to thetotal human being as a physical body, and as a conglomerate of energy fields.They agitate the energy that has been accumulated in the luminous ball andreturn it to the physical body itself. The magical passes engage both the bodyitself as a physical entity that suffers the dispersion of energy, and the bodyas an energetic entity which is capable of redeploying that dispersed energy.\"Having energy on the periphery of the luminous ball,\" he continued, \"energythat is not being redeployed, is as useless as not having any energy at all. Itis truly a terrifying situation to have a surplus of energy stashed away;inaccessible for all practical purposes. It is like being in the desert, dyingof dehydration, while you carry a tank of water that you cannot open, becauseyou don't have any tools. In that desert, you can't even find a rock to bang itwith.\"The true magic of the magical passes is the fact that they cause crusted-downenergy to enter again into the centers of vitality, hence the feeling ofwell-being and prowess which is the practitioner's experience.The sorcerers of don Juan's lineage- before they entered into their excessiveritualism and ceremony- had formulated the basis for this redeployment. Theycalled it saturation; meaning that they inundated their bodies with a profusionof magical passes in order to allow the force that binds us together to guidethose magical passes to cause the maximum redeployment of energy.I asked him once, without really meaning to be sarcastic, \"But don Juan, are youtelling me that every time you crack your joints, or every time I try to imitateyou, we are really redeploying energy!\"\"Every time we execute a magical pass,\" he replied, \"we are indeed altering thebasic structures of our beings. Energy which is ordinarily crusted down isreleased and begins to enter into the vortexes of vitality of the body. Only bymeans of that reclaimed energy can we put up a dike; a barrier to contain anotherwise uncontainable and always deleterious flow.\"I asked don Juan to give me an example of putting a dam on what he was calling adeleterious flow. I told him that I wanted to visualize it in my mind.\"I'll give you an example,\" he said. \"For instance, at my age, I should be preyto high blood pressure. If I went to see a doctor, the doctor, upon seeing me,would assume that I must be an old Indian, plagued with uncertainties,frustrations, and bad diet; all of this, naturally, resulting in a most expectedand predictable condition of high blood pressure: an acceptable corollary of myage.\"I don't have any problems with high blood pressure,\" he went on, \"not because Iam stronger than the average man or because of my genetic frame, but because mymagical passes have made my body break through any patterns of behavior thatresult in high blood pressure. I can truthfully say that every time I crack myjoints following the execution of a magical pass, I am blocking off the flow ofexpectations and behavior that ordinarily result in high blood pressure at myage.\"Another example I can give you is the agility of my knees,\" he continued.\"Haven't you noticed how much more agile I am than you? When it comes to movingmy knees, I'm a kid! With my magical passes, I put a dam on the current ofbehavior and physicality that makes the knees of people, both men and women,stiff with age.\"One of the most annoying feelings I had ever experienced was caused by the factthat don Juan Matus, although he could have been my grandfather, was infinitelyyounger than I. In comparison, I was stiff, opinionated, repetitious. I wassenile.He, on the other hand, was fresh, inventive, agile, and resourceful. In short,he possessed something which, although I was young, I did not possess: youth. Hedelighted in telling me repeatedly that young age was not youth, and that youngage was in no way a deterrent to senility. He pointed out that if I watched myfellow men carefully and dispassionately, I would be able to corroborate that bythe time they reached twenty years of age, they were already senile, repeatingthemselves inanely.\"How is it possible, don Juan,\" I said, \"that you could be younger than I?\"\"I have vanquished my mind,\" he said, opening his eyes wide to denotebewilderment. \"I don't have a mind to tell me that it is time to be old. I don'thonor agreements in which I didn't participate. Remember this: It is not just aslogan for sorcerers to say that they do not honor agreements in which they didnot participate. To be plagued by old age is one such agreement.\"We were silent for a long time. Don Juan seemed to be waiting, I thought, forthe effect that his words might cause in me. What I thought to be mypsychological unity was further ripped apart by a clearly dual response on mypart. On one level, I repudiated [* repudiated- refuse to acknowledge, ratify,or recognize as valid] with all my might the nonsense that don Juan wasverbalizing; on another level, however, I couldn't fail to notice how accuratehis remarks were.Don Juan was old, and yet he wasn't old at all. He was ages younger than I. Hewas free from encumbering thoughts and habit patterns. He was roaming around inincredible worlds. He was free, while I was imprisoned by heavy thought patternsand habits; by petty and futile considerations about myself, which I felt onthat occasion for the first time weren't even mine. I asked don Juan on another occasion something that had been bothering me for along time. He had stated that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico had discovered themagical passes as some sort of hidden treasure placed in storage for man tofind. I wanted to know who would put something like that in storage for man. Theonly idea that I could come up with was derived from Catholicism. I thought ofGod doing it, or a guardian angel, or the Holy Spirit.\"It is not the Holy Spirit,\" he said, \"which is only holy to you because you'resecretly a Catholic. And certainly it is not God; a benevolent father as youunderstand God. Nor is it a goddess; a nurturing mother watching over theaffairs of men as many people believe to be the case.\"It is rather an impersonal force that has endless things in storage for thosewho dare to seek them. It is a force in the universe; just as light and gravityare forces. This impersonal force is an agglutinating [* agglutinate- clumptogether] factor; a vibratory force that joins the conglomerate of energy fieldsthat human beings are into one concise, cohesive unit. This vibratory force isthe factor that doesn't allow the entrance or the exit of energy from theluminous ball.\"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico,\" he went on, \"believed that the performance oftheir magical passes was the only factor that prepared and led the body to theotherworldly verification of the existence of that agglutinating force.\"From don Juan's explanations, I derived the conclusion that the vibratory forcehe spoke about which agglutinates our fields of energy is apparently similar towhat modern-day astronomers believe must happen at the core of all the galaxiesthat exist in the cosmos. They believe that at their cores, a force ofincalculable strength holds the stars of galaxies in place. This force, called a'black hole', is a theoretical construct which seems to be the most reasonableexplanation as to why stars do not fly away, driven by their own rotationalspeeds.Don Juan said that the old sorcerers knew that human beings, taken asconglomerates of energy fields, are held together not by energetic wrappings orenergetic ligaments, but by some sort of vibration that renders everything atonce alive and in place. Don Juan explained that those sorcerers, by means oftheir practices and their discipline, became capable of handling that vibratoryforce once they were fully conscious of it. Their expertise in dealing with itbecame so extraordinary that their actions were transformed into legends;mythological events that existed only as fables. For instance, one of thestories that don Juan told about the ancient sorcerers was that they werecapable of dissolving their physical mass by merely placing their fullconsciousness and intent on that force.Don Juan stated that, although they were capable of actually going through apinhole if they deemed it necessary, they were never quite satisfied with theresult of this maneuver of dissolving their mass. The reason for theirdiscontent was that once their mass was dissolved, their capacity to actvanished. They were left with the ability of only witnessing events in whichthey were incapable of participating.Their ensuing frustration, the result of being unable to act, turned, accordingto don Juan, into their damning flaw: their obsession with uncovering the natureof that vibratory force; an obsession driven by their concreteness, which madethem want to hold and control that force. Their fervent desire was to strikefrom the ghostlike condition of masslessness; something which Jon Juan saidcould not ever be accomplished.Modern-day practitioners, the cultural heirs of those sorcerers of antiquity,found out that it is not possible to be concrete and utilitarian about thatvibratory force. Modern-day practitioners have opted for the only rationalalternative: to become conscious of that force with no other purpose in sightexcept the elegance and well-being brought about by knowledge.Don Juan said to me once, \"The only permissible time when modern-day sorcerersuse the power of this vibratory agglutinating force is when they burn fromwithin; when the time comes for them to leave this world. It is simplicityitself for sorcerers to place their absolute and total consciousness on thebinding force with the intent to burn; and off they go like a puff of air.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Tensegrity'Tensegrity' is the modern version of the magical passes of the shamans ofancient Mexico. The word Tensegrity is a most appropriate definition, because itis a mixture of the two terms 'tension' and 'integrity'. These terms express thetwo driving forces of the magical passes.Tension is the activity created by contracting and relaxing the tendons andmuscles of the body. Integrity is the act of regarding the body as a sound,complete, perfect unit.Tensegrity is taught as a system of movements because that is the only manner inwhich the mysterious and vast subject of the magical passes could be faced in amodern setting. The people who now practice Tensegrity are not shamanpractitioners in search of shamanistic alternatives that involve rigorousdiscipline, exertion, and hardships. Therefore, the emphasis of the magicalpasses has to be on their value as movements, and all the consequences that suchmovements bring forth.Don Juan Matus explained that the ancient Mexican sorcerers of his lineage, inrelating to the magical passes, first strove to saturate themselves withmovement.They arranged every posture and movement of the body that they could rememberinto groups. They believed that the longer the group, the greater its effect ofsaturation; and the greater the need for the practitioners to use their memoryto recall it.The shamans of don Juan's lineage, after arranging the magical passes into longgroups and practicing them as sequences, deemed that this criterion ofsaturation had fulfilled its purposes, and they dropped it. From then on, whatwas sought was the opposite: the fragmentation of the long groups into singlesegments, which were practiced as individual, independent units. The manner inwhich don Juan Matus taught the magical passes to his four disciples- TaishaAbelar, Florinda Donner-Grau, Carol Figgs, and myself- was the product of thisdrive for fragmentation.Don Juan's personal opinion was that the benefit of practicing the long groupswas patently obvious; such practice forced the shaman initiates to use theirkinesthetic [* kinesthesis- relating to the ability to feel movements of thelimbs and body] memory. He considered the use of kinesthetic memory to be a realbonus, which those shamans had stumbled upon accidentally, and which had themarvelous effect of shutting off the noise of the mind: the internal dialogue. Don Juan had explained to me that the way in which we reinforce our perceptionof the world, and keep it fixed at a certain level of efficiency and function,is by talking to ourselves.\"The entire human race,\" he said to me on one occasion, \"keeps a determinedlevel of function and efficiency by means of the internal dialogue. The internaldialogue is the key to maintaining the assemblage point stationary at theposition shared by the entire human race: at the height of the shoulder blades,an arm's length away from them.\"By accomplishing the opposite of the internal dialogue,\" he went on, \"that isto say, maintaining inner silence, practitioners can break the fixation of theirassemblage points, and thus acquire an extraordinary fluidity of perception.\" The practice of Tensegrity has been arranged around the performance of the longgroups, which in Tensegrity have been renamed 'series' to avoid the genericimplication of calling them just groups, as don Juan called them. In order toaccomplish this arrangement, it was necessary to reestablish the criteria ofsaturation which had prompted the creation of the long groups. It took thepractitioners of Tensegrity years of meticulous and concentrated work toreassemble a great number of the dismembered groups.Reestablishing the criteria of saturation by performing the long series gave asa result something which don Juan had already defined as the modern goal of themagical passes: the redeployment of energy.Don Juan was convinced that this had always been the unspoken goal of themagical passes even at the time of the old sorcerers. The old sorcerers didn'tseem to have known this, but even if they did, they never conceptualized it inthose terms. By all indications, what the old sorcerers sought avidly andexperienced as a sensation of well-being and plenitude when they performed themagical passes was, in essence, the effect of unused energy being reclaimed bythe centers of vitality in the body.In Tensegrity, the long groups have been reassembled, and a great number of thefragments have been kept as single, functioning units. These single units havebeen strung together by purpose- for instance, the purpose of intending, or thepurpose of recapitulation, or the purpose of inner silence, and so on- creatingin this fashion the Tensegrity series. In this manner, a system has beenachieved in which the best results are obtained by performing long sequences ofmovements that definitely tax the kinesthetic memory of the practitioners.In every other respect, the way Tensegrity is taught is a faithful reproductionof the way in which don Juan taught the magical passes to his disciples. Heinundated us with a profusion of detail, and let our minds be bewildered by thenumber and variety of magical passes taught to us; and let us be bewildered bythe implication that each of the passes individually was a pathway to infinity.His disciples spent years overwhelmed, confused, and above all despondent,because they felt that being inundated in such a manner was an unfair onslaughton them.\"When I teach you the magical passes,\" he explained to me once when I questionedhim about the subject, \"I am following the traditional sorcerers' device ofclouding your linear view. By saturating your I kinesthetic memory, I amcreating a pathway for you to inner silence.\"Since all of us,\" he continued, \"are filled to the brim with the doings andundoings of the world of everyday life, we have very little room for kinestheticmemory. You may have noticed that you have none. When, you want to imitate mymovements, you cannot remain facing me. You have to stand side by side with mein order to establish in your own body what's right and what's left.\"Now, if a long sequence of movements were presented to you, it would take youweeks of repetition to remember all the movements. While you're trying tomemorize the movements, you have to make room for them in your memory by pushingother things out of the way. That was the effect that the old sorcerers sought.\"Don Juan's contention was that if his disciples kept on doggedly practicing themagical passes in spite of their confusion, they would arrive at a thresholdwhen their redeployed energy would tip the scales, and they would be able tohandle the magical passes with absolute clarity.When don Juan made those statements, I could hardly believe them. Nevertheless,at one moment, just as he had said, I ceased to be confused and despondent. In amost mysterious way, the magical passes, since they are magical, arrangedthemselves into extraordinary sequences that cleared up everything. Don Juanexplained that the clarity I was experiencing was the result of the redeploymentof my energy. The concern of people practicing Tensegrity nowadays matches exactly my concernand the concern of don Juan's other disciples when we first began to perform themagical passes. They feel bewildered by the number of movements. I reiterate tothem what don Juan reiterated to me over and over; that what is of supremeimportance is to practice whatever Tensegrity sequence is remembered.The saturation that has been carried on will give, in the end, the resultssought by the shamans of ancient Mexico: the redeployment of energy, and itsthree concomitants- [* concomitants- events or situations that happens at thesame time as or in connection with another] the shutting off of the internaldialogue, the possibility for inner silence, and the fluidity of the assemblagepoint.As a personal assessment, I can say that by saturating me with the magicalpasses, don Juan accomplished two formidable feats: One, he brought to thesurface a flock of hidden resources that I had but didn't know existed- such asthe ability to concentrate and the ability to remember detail; and two, hegently broke my obsession with my linear mode of interpretation.When I questioned don Juan about what I was experiencing in this respect, heexplained, \"What is happening to you is that you are feeling the advent of innersilence when your internal dialogue has been minimally offset. A new flux ofthings has begun to enter into your field of perception. These things werealways there on the periphery of your general awareness, but you never hadenough energy to be deliberately conscious of them. As you chase away yourinternal dialogue, other items of awareness begin to fill in the empty space, soto speak.\"The new flux of energy,\" he went on, \"which the magical passes have brought toyour centers of vitality is making your assemblage point more fluid. It's nolonger rigidly palisaded. [* palisaded- surrounded with a wall in order tofortify] You're no longer driven by our ancestral fears which make us incapableof taking a step in any direction. Sorcerers say that energy makes us free, andthat is the absolute truth.\"The ideal state of Tensegrity practitioners in relation to the Tensegritymovements is the same as the ideal state of a practitioner of shamanism inrelation to the execution of the magical passes. Both are being led by themovements themselves into an unprecedented culmination. From there, thepractitioners of Tensegrity will be able to execute- by themselves and forwhatever effect they see fit without any coaching from outside sources- anymovement from the bulk of movements with which they have been saturated. Theywill be able to execute any movement with precision and speed as they walk, oreat, or rest, or do anything; because they will have the energy to do so.The execution of the magical passes, as shown in Tensegrity, doesn't necessarilyrequire a particular space or prearranged time. However, the movements should bedone away from sharp currents of air. Don Juan dreaded currents of air on aperspiring body. He firmly believed that not every current of air was caused bythe rising or lowering of temperature in the atmosphere, and that some currentsof air were actually caused by conglomerates of consolidated energy fieldsmoving purposefully through space.Don Juan was convinced that such conglomerates of energy fields possessed aspecific type of awareness particularly deleterious because human beings cannotordinarily detect them and become exposed to them indiscriminately. Thedeleterious effect of such conglomerates of energy fields is especiallyprevalent in a large metropolis where they could be easily disguised as, ifnothing else, the momentum created by the speed of passing automobiles.Something else to bear in mind when practicing Tensegrity is that since the goalof the magical passes is something foreign to Western man, an effort should bemade to keep the practice of Tensegrity detached from the concerns of our dailyworld. The practice of Tensegrity should not be mixed with elements with whichwe are already thoroughly familiar, such as conversation, music, or the sound ofa radio or TV newsman reporting the news, no matter how muffled the sound mightbe.The setting of modern urban life facilitates the formation of groups, and underthese circumstances, the only manner in which Tensegrity can he taught andpracticed in the seminars and workshops is in groups of practitioners.Practicing in groups is beneficial in many aspects and deleterious in others. Itis beneficial because it allows the creation of a consensus of movement and theopportunity to learn by examination and comparison. It is deleterious because itfosters the reliance on others, and the emergence of syntactic commands andsolicitations dealing with hierarchy.Don Juan conceived that since the totality of human behavior was ruled bylanguage, human beings have learned to respond to what he called syntacticcommands, praising or deprecatory formulas built into language- for example, theresponses that each individual makes, or elicits in others, with slogans suchas: No problem, Piece of cake, It's time to worry, You could do better, I can'tdo it, My butt is too big, I'm the best, I'm the worst in the world, I couldlive with that, I'm coping, Everything's going to be okay, etc., etc. Don Juanmaintained that what sorcerers have always wanted, as a basic rule of thumb, isto run away from activities derived from syntactic commands.Originally, as don Juan described it, the magical passes were performed by theshamans of ancient Mexico individually and in solitariness, on the spur of themoment, or as the necessity arose. He taught them to his disciples in the samefashion. Don Juan stated that for the shaman practitioners, the challenge ofperforming the magical passes has always been to execute them perfectly; holdingin mind only the abstract view of their perfect execution. Ideally, Tensegrityshould be taught and practiced in the same fashion.However, the conditions of modern life and the fact that the goal of the magicalpasses has been formulated to apply to a great number of people make itimperative that a new approach be taken. Tensegrity should be practiced inwhatever form is easiest: either in groups, or alone, or both.In my particular case, the practice of Tensegrity in very large groups has beenmore than ideal because it has given me the unique opportunity of witnessingsomething which don Juan Matus and all the sorcerers of his lineage never did:the effects of human mass. Don Juan and all the shamans of his lineage, which heconsidered to be twenty-seven generations long, never were capable of witnessingthe effects of human mass. They practiced the magical passes alone or in groupsof up to five practitioners. For them, the magical passes were highlyindividualistic.If the number of Tensegrity practitioners is in the hundreds, an energeticcurrent is nearly instantaneously formed among them. This energetic current,which a shaman could easily see, creates in the practitioners a sense ofurgency. It is like a vibratory wind that sweeps through them, and gives themthe primary elements of purpose. I have been privileged to see something Iconsidered to be a portentous [* portentous- of momentous or ominoussignificance] sight: the awakening of purpose; the energetic basis of man. DonJuan Matus used to call this unbending intent. He taught me that unbendingintent is the essential tool of those who journeyed into the unknown.A very important issue to consider when practicing Tensegrity is that themovements must be executed with the idea that the benefit of the magical passescomes by itself. This idea must be stressed at any cost. At the beginning, it isvery difficult to discern the fact that Tensegrity is not a standard system ofmovements for developing the body. It indeed develops the body, but only as aby-product of a more transcendental effect. By redeploying unused energy, themagical passes can conduce the practitioner to a level of awareness in which theparameters of normal, traditional perception are canceled out by the fact thatthey are expanded. The practitioner can thus be allowed even to enter intounimaginable worlds.\"But why would I want to enter into those worlds?\" I asked don Juan when hedescribed this post-effect of the magical passes.\"Because you are a creature of awareness; a perceiver, like the rest of us,\" hesaid. \"Human beings are on a journey of awareness which has been momentarilyinterrupted by extraneous forces. Believe me, we are magical creatures ofawareness. If we don't have this conviction, we have nothing.\"He further explained that human beings, from the moment their journey ofawareness was interrupted, have been caught in an eddy, so to speak, and arespinning around, having the impression of moving with the current, and yetremaining stationary.\"Take my word,\" don Juan went on, \"because mine are not arbitrary statements. Myword is the result of corroborating for myself what the shamans of ancientMexico found out: that we human beings are magical beings.\"It has taken me thirty years of hard discipline to come to a point where donJuan's statements are recognizable, and their validity is established beyond theshadow of a doubt. I know now that human beings are creatures of awarenessinvolved in an evolutionary journey of awareness; beings indeed unknown tothemselves; filled to the brim with incredible resources that can be used. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Six Series of TensegrityThe six series which are going to be discussed are the following:1. The Series for Preparing Intent2. The Series for the Womb3. The Series of the Five Concerns: The Westwood Series4. The Separation of the Left Body and the Right Body: The Heat Series5. The Masculinity Series6. The Series for Devices Used in Conjunction with Specific Magical Passes The particular magical passes of Tensegrity that comprise each of the six seriesconform with a criterion of maximum efficiency. In other words, each magicalpass is a precise ingredient of a formula. This is a replica of the way in whichthe long series of magical passes were originally used: Each series wassufficient in itself to produce the maximum release of redeployable energy.In executing the magical passes, there are certain things that must be takeninto consideration in order to perform the movements with maximum efficiency: 1. All the magical passes of the six series can be repeated as many times asdesired, unless otherwise specified. If they are first done with the left sideof the body, they must be repeated an equal number of times with the right side.As a rule, every magical pass of the six series begins with the left side. 2. The feet are kept separate by a distance equivalent to the shoulders' width.This is a balanced way to distribute the weight of the body. If the legs arespread too far apart, the balance of the body is impaired. The same thinghappens if they are too close together. The best way to arrive at this distanceis to begin from a position where the two feet are close together (fig.1).img3.png [images/img3.png] The tips of the feet are then pivoted on the fixedheels and opened in a letter V shape (fig. 2).img4.png [images/img4.png]Shifting the weight to the tips of the feet, the heels are pivoted out to thesides an equal distance (fig. 3).img5.png [images/img5.png] The tips of the feetare brought into parallel alignment, and the distance between the feet isroughly the width of the shoulders. Further adjustment may be necessary here inorder to reach that desired width and to get the optimal balance of the body. 3. During the execution of all the magical passes of Tensegrity, the knees arekept slightly bent, so that when one is looking down, the kneecaps block theview of the tips of the feet (figs. 4, 5),img6.png [images/img6.png]img7.png[images/img7.png] except in the case of specific magical passes in which theknees have to be locked. Such cases are indicated in the description of thosepasses. To have the knees locked doesn't mean that the hamstrings areinjuriously tense, but rather that they are locked in a gentle way, withoutunnecessary force.This position of bending the knees is a modern addition to the execution of themagical passes; one that stems from influences of recent times. One of theleaders of don Juan Matus's lineage was the nagual Lujan, a sailor from Chinawhose original name was something like Lo Ban.He came to Mexico around the turn of the nineteenth century, and stayed therefor the rest of his life. One of the women sorcerers in don Juan Matus's ownparty went to the Orient and studied martial arts. Don Juan Matus himselfrecommended that his disciples learn to move in a disciplined fashion by takingup some form of martial arts training.Another issue to consider in reference to the slightly bent knees is that whenthe legs are moved forward in a kicking motion, the knees are never whipped.Rather, the whole leg should be moved by the tension of the muscles of thethighs. Moving in this fashion, the tendons of the knees are never injured. 4. The back muscles of the legs must be tensed (fig. 6).img8.png[images/img8.png] This is a very difficult accomplishment. Most people can learnquite easily to tense the front muscles of the legs, but the back muscles of thelegs still remain flaccid. Don Juan said that the back muscles of the thighs arewhere personal history is always stored in the body. According to him, feelingsfind their home there and get stagnant. He maintained that difficulty inchanging behavior patterns could be easily attributed to the flaccidity of theback muscles of the thighs. 5. While performing all these magical passes, the arms are always kept slightlybent at the elbows- never fully extended- when they are moved to strike,preventing, in this manner, the tendons of the elbows from becoming irritated(fig. 7).img9.png [images/img9.png] 6. The thumb must always be kept in a locked position, meaning that it is foldedover the edge of the hand. It should never stick out (fig. 8).img10.png[images/img10.png] The sorcerers of don Juan's lineage considered the thumb tobe a crucial element in terms of energy and function. They believed that at thebase of the thumb exist points where energy can become stagnant, and points thatcan regulate the flow of energy in the body. In order to avoid unnecessarystress on the thumb or injury resulting from jolting the hand forcefully, theyadopted the measure of pressing the thumbs against the inside edges of thehands. 7. When the hand is made into a fist, the little finger is raised to avoid anangular fist (fig. 9)img11.png [images/img11.png] in which the middle, fourth,and fifth fingers droop. The idea is that in making a square fist (fig.10),img12.png [images/img12.png] the fourth and fifth fingers have to be raised,thus creating a peculiar tension in the axilla, a tension which is mostdesirable for general well-being. 8. The hands, when they have to be opened, are fully extended. The tendons ofthe back of the hand are at work, presenting the palm as an even, flat surface(fig. 11).img13.png [images/img13.png] Don Juan preferred a flat palm tocounteract the tendency (established, he felt, through socialization) to presentthe hand as a hollow palm (fig. 12).img14.png [images/img14.png] He said that ahollow palm was the palm of a beggar, and that whoever practices the magicalpasses is a warrior, not a beggar in the least. 9. When the fingers have to be contracted at the second knuckle and bent tightlyover the palm, the tendons on the back of the hand are tensed to the maximum,especially the tendons of the thumb (fig. 13).img15.png [images/img15.png] Thistension of the tendons creates a pressure on the wrists and forearms, areaswhich sorcerers of ancient Mexico believed were key in promoting health andwell-being. 10. In many Tensegrity movements, the wrists have to be bent forward or backwardto an approximately ninety-degree angle by contracting the tendons of theforearm (fig. 14).img16.png [images/img16.png] This bending must be accomplishedslowly, because most of the time the wrist is quite inflexible, and it isimportant that the wrist acquire the flexibility to turn the back of the hand tomake a maximum angle with the forearm. 11. Another important issue in the practice of Tensegrity is an act which hasbeen termed turning the body on. This is a unique act in which all the musclesof the body, and specifically the diaphragm, are contracted in one instant. Themuscles of the stomach and abdomen are jolted, as are the muscles around theshoulders and shoulder blades. The arms and legs are tensed in unison with equalforce, but only for an instant (figs. 15, 16).img17.png[images/img17.png]img18.png [images/img18.png] As practitioners of Tensegrityprogress in their practice, they can learn to sustain this tension for a whilelonger.Turning the body on has nothing to do with the state of perennial bodily tensionthat seems to be the mark of our times. When the body is tense withpreoccupation or overwork, and the muscles of the neck are as hard as they canbe, the body is not in any way turned on. Relaxing the muscles or arriving at astate of tranquillity is not turning the body off, either. The idea of thesorcerers of ancient Mexico was that with their magical passes, the body wasalerted: It was made to be ready for action. Don Juan Matus termed thiscondition turning the body on. He said that when the muscular tension of turningthe body on ceases, the body is turned off naturally. 12. Breath and breathing were, according to don Juan, of supreme importance forthe sorcerers of ancient Mexico. They divided breath into breathing with thetops of the lungs, breathing with the midsection of the lungs, and breathingwith the abdomen (figs. 17, 18, 19).img19.png [images/img19.png]img20.png[images/img20.png]img21.png [images/img21.png] Breathing by expanding thediaphragm they called the animal breath, and they practiced it assiduously, donJuan said, for longevity and health.It was don Juan Matus's belief that many of the health problems of modern mancould be easily corrected by deep breathing. He maintained that the tendency ofhuman beings nowadays is to take shallow breaths. One of the aims of thesorcerers of ancient Mexico was to train their bodies, by means of the magicalpasses, to inhale and exhale deeply.It is highly recommended, therefore, in the movements of Tensegrity that callfor deep inhalations and exhalations, that these be accomplished by slowing downthe inflow or outflow of air in order to make the inhalations and exhalationslonger and more profound.Another important issue concerning the breathing in Tensegrity is that breathingis normal while executing the Tensegrity movements, unless otherwise specifiedin the description of any given magical pass. 13. Another consideration in performing the Tensegrity movements is therealization that has to come to practitioners that Tensegrity is in essence theinterplay between relaxing and tensing the muscles of choice parts of the bodyin order to arrive at a most coveted physical explosion, which the sorcerers ofancient Mexico knew only as the energy of the tendons. This is a veritableexplosion of the nerves and tendons below or at the core of the muscles.Given that Tensegrity is the tension and relaxation of muscles, the intensity ofthe muscle tension, and the length of time that the muscles are kept in thatstate in any given magical pass, depends on the strength of the participant. Itis recommended that at the beginning of the practice, the tension be minimal andthe length of time as brief as possible. As the body gets warmer, the tensionshould become greater and the length of time extended, but always in a moderatefashion. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The First Series: The Series for Preparing IntentDon Juan Matus stated that human beings as organisms perform a stupendousmaneuver of perception which, unfortunately, creates a misconception; a falsefront. Human beings take the influx of sheer energy in the universe at large andturn it into sensory data which they interpret according to a strict system ofinterpretation that sorcerers call the human form. This magical act ofinterpreting pure energy gives rise to a misconception; the peculiar convictionof human beings that their interpretation system is all that exists.Don Juan elucidated this phenomenon with an example. He said that tree, as treeis known to human beings, is more interpretation than perception. He pointed outthat for human beings to establish the presence of tree, all they need is acursory glance that tells them hardly anything. The rest is a phenomenon whichhe described as the calling of intent; the intent of tree; that is to say, theinterpretation of sensory data pertaining to the specific phenomenon that humanbeings call tree.He declared that, just as in the tree example, the entire world of human beingsis composed of an endless repertoire of interpretations where human senses playa minimal role. In other words, only the visual sense touches the energy influxwhich comes from the universe at large, and it does so only in a cursoryfashion.He maintained that the majority of the perceptual activity of human beings isinterpretation, and that human beings are the kind of organisms that need only aminimal input of pure perception in order to create their world; or, that theyperceive only enough to trigger their interpretation system.The example that don Juan liked the best was the way in which he said weconstruct, by intending, something as overwhelming and as crucial as the WhiteHouse.He called the White House the site of power of today's world, the center of allour endeavors, hopes, fears, and so on, as a global conglomerate of humanbeings- for all practical purposes, the capital of the civilized world. He saidthat all this wasn't in the realm of the abstract, or even in the realm of ourminds, but in the realm of intending, because from the point of view of oursensory input, the White House was a building that in no way had the richness,the scope, or the depth of the concept of the White House. He added that fromthe point of view of the input of sensory data, the White House, like everythingelse in our world, was cursorily apprehended with our visual senses only; ourtactile, olfactory, auditory, and taste senses were not engaged in any way. Theinterpretation that those senses could make of sensory data in relation to thebuilding where the White House is would have no meaning whatsoever.The question that don Juan asked as a sorcerer was where the White House was. Hesaid, answering his own question, that it was certainly not in our perception,not even in our thoughts, but in a special realm of intending, where it wasnurtured with everything pertinent to it. Don Juan's assertion was that tocreate a total universe of intending in such a manner was our magic. Since the theme of the first series of Tensegrity is preparing the practitionersfor intending, it's important to review the sorcerers' definition of intending.For don Juan, intending was the unstated and unrealized act of filling out theempty spaces left from direct sensory perception; or the act of enrichingobservable phenomena by means of intending a completeness that doesn't existfrom the point of view of pure perception.The act of intending this completeness was referred to by don Juan as 'callingintent'. Everything he explained about intent pointed to the fact that the actof intending is not in the realm of the physical. In other words, it is not partof the physicality of the brain or any other organ. Intent, for don Juan,transcended the world we know. It is something like an energetic wave, a beam ofenergy which attaches itself to us.Because of the extrinsic nature of intent, don Juan made a distinction betweenthe body as part of the cognition of everyday life, and the body as an energeticunit which was not part of that cognition.This energetic unit of our bodies outside normal awareness included: the unseenparts of the body, such as the internal organs; and the energy that flowedthrough them. Don Juan asserted that it was with this part of our totality thatenergy could be directly perceived.He pointed out that because of the predominance of sight in our habitual way ofperceiving the world, the shamans of ancient Mexico described the act ofdirectly apprehending energy as 'seeing'.For them to perceive energy as it flowed in the universe meant this: Sinceenergy at large is independent of us as individuals, and is arranged in specificconfigurations that repeats itself consistently, those configurations could beperceived in the same terms by anyone who sees.The most important example don Juan Matus could give of this consistency ofenergy in adopting specific configurations was the perception of the human bodywhen it was seen directly as energy. As it was already said, shamans like donJuan perceive a human being as a conglomerate of energy fields that gives thetotal impression of a clear-cut sphere of luminosity.Taken in this sense, energy is described by shamans as a vibration thatagglutinates itself into cohesive units. Shamans describe the entire universe asbeing composed of energy configurations that appear to the seeing eye asfilaments, or luminous fibers that are strung in every which way without everbeing entangled. This is an incomprehensible proposition for the linear mind. Ithas a built-in contradiction that can't be resolved: How could those fibersextend themselves every which way and yet not be entangled?Don Juan emphasized the point that shamans were able only to describe events,and that if their terms of description seemed inadequate and contradictory, itwas because of the limitations of syntax. Yet their descriptions were as strictas anything could be.The shamans of ancient Mexico, according to don Juan, described intent as aperennial force that permeates the entire universe- a force that is aware ofitself to the point of responding to the beckoning or to the command of shamans.By means of intent, those shamans were capable of unleashing not only all thehuman possibilities of perceiving, but all the human possibilities of action.Through intent, they realized the most far-fetched formulations. Don Juan taught me that the limit of man's capability of perceiving is calledthe band of man, meaning that there is a boundary that marks human capabilitiesas dictated by the human organism. These boundaries are not merely thetraditional boundaries of orderly thought, but the boundaries of the totality ofresources locked within the human organism.The bulk of these resources are never used, and are kept out of our normalawareness by our preconceived ideas about human limitations; limitations thathave nothing to do with actual human potential.Don Juan stated as categorically as he was able to that since perceiving energyas it flows in the universe is not arbitrary [* arbitrary- based on or subjectto individual discretion or preference or sometimes impulse or caprice] oridiosyncratic, [* idiosyncratic- peculiar to the individual] seers witnessformulations of energy that happen by themselves and are not molded by humaninterference. Thus, the perception of such formulations is, in itself and byitself, the key that releases the locked-in human potential that ordinarily hasnever entered into play. In order to elicit the perception of those energeticformulations, the totality of human capabilities to perceive has to be engaged. The Series for Preparing Intent is divided into four groups. The first is calledMashing Energy for Intent. The second is called Stirring Up Energy for Intent.The third group is called Gathering Energy for Intent, and the fourth group iscalled Breathing In the Energy of Intent. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The First Series: First Group: Mashing Energy for IntentDon Juan gave me explanations which covered all the nuances of every group ofmagical passes which are the core of the long Tensegrity Series. \"Energy which is essential for handling intent,\" he said when he was explainingto me the energetic implications of this group, \"is continuously dispelled fromthe vital centers located around the liver, pancreas, and kidneys; and settlesdown at the bottom of the luminous sphere that we are.\"This energy ought to be constantly stirred and rerouted. The sorcerers of mylineage were very emphatic in recommending a systematic and controlled stirringof energy with the legs and feet. However, long walks, which were an unavoidablefeature of their lives, resulted in an excessive stirring of energy which servedno purpose.\"In don Juan's view, energy for intending that was stirred up excessively endedup further depleting the centers of vitality, and long walks were their nemesis[* nemesis- something causing misery] for this reason.The inflow of excessive energy had to be balanced by the execution of specificmagical passes performed while they were walking. Don Juan Matus told me that this set of fifteen magical passes functions to stirenergy with the feet and legs, and was considered by the shamans of his lineageto be the most effective way of doing what they called 'mashing energy'. Hestated that each of the steps is a magical pass which has a built-in control forthe mashing of energy. Practitioners can repeat these magical passes hundreds oftimes, if they so desire, without worrying about an excessive stirring ofenergy. The first five magical passes of this group allow practitioners a quick surge ofenergy, in cases when energy is needed in the midsection or the groin, or, forinstance, when they need to perform a long-distance run or a quick climbing ofrocks or trees. 1. Grinding Energy with Three Toe Pivots of the FeetAmong other things, this pass is used to gain balance for the passes whichfollow.The feet start about shoulder length apart pointing straight ahead. The bodypivots on the balls of the feet from right to left and left to right in unison.The heels are slightly off the ground while swiveling, and touch the ground whenthe feet reach the maximum slant.The first movement is to the left. After the third touch of the heels to theright, the feet return to a straight position.For each of the first three passes, there is a pause that lasts an instant, andthen the feet are swiveled three times again. The effect of these passes isincreased by making the grinding of energy a discontinuous affair.It is important to notice that in all the first three magical passes of thisseries, a key issue is the engagement of the arms, which move back and forthbriskly.The arms are kept bent at the elbows with the hands pointing out, palms facingeach other. The arms move with an impulse from the shoulders and the shoulderblades. This movement of the arms in unison with the legs, as in walking (theright arm moves when the left leg moves, and vice versa), accounts for a totalengagement of the limbs and the internal organs (figs. 20, 21).img22.png[images/img22.png]img23.png [images/img23.png]A physical by-product of grinding energy in this fashion is an increase incirculation in the feet, calves, and thighs up to the groin area. Shamansthroughout the centuries have also used it to restore flexibility to limbs thatwere injured in daily use. 2. Grinding Energy with Three Heel Pivots of the FeetIn the second pass, the weight of the body is shifted to the heels, and thepivoting is done on them with the toes slightly off the ground while swiveling,and touching the ground when the feet reach the maximum slant.The feet are swiveled on the heels, in the same manner as in the previousmagical pass, three times.A physical by-product of this magical pass is a quick surge of energy forinstances of running or fleeing danger, or for anything that requires a quickintervention. 3. Grinding Energy by a Sideways Slide of the FeetBoth feet, pivoting on the heels, move to the left; they pivot on the balls ofthe feet to the left again. Next, they pivot a third time, still to the left,but on the heels again (figs. 22, 23, 24).img24.png [images/img24.png] img25.png[images/img25.png]img26.png [images/img26.png]The sequence is reversed bypivoting on the heels to the right; next, on the balls of the feet to the right;and then on the heels again, to the right.A physical consequence of these three magical passes is the spurring of thecirculation in the total body. 4. Mixing Energy by Striking the Floor with the HeelsThis magical pass resembles walking in place. The knee moves up briskly whilethe tip of the foot rests on the ground. The weight of the body is carried bythe other leg. The body weight shifts back and forth, resting on whichever legstays put, while the other one performs the movement. The arms are moved in thesame fashion as in the previous magical passes (fig. 25).img27.png[images/img27.png]A physical consequence of this magical pass and the following one is very muchlike that of the three preceding magical passes: a sensation of well-being thatpermeates the pelvic region after performing the movements. 5. Mixing Energy by Striking the Ground with the Heels Three TimesThis magical pass is exactly like the preceding one, with the exception that themovement of the knees and feet is not continuous. It is interrupted after theheels are brought to the ground three times, in an alternating fashion. Thesequence is left, right, left- pause- right, left, right, and so on. 6. Gathering Energy with the Soles of the Feet and Moving It Up the Inner LegsThe soles of the left and the right foot move alternately up the inner part ofthe opposite leg, almost brushing it. It is important to arch the legs a littlebit by standing with the knees bent (fig. 26).img28.png [images/img28.png]In this magical pass, energy for intending is forced up the inner side of thelegs, which shamans consider to be the storage place of kinesthetic [*kinesthetic- relating to the ability to feel movements of the limbs and body]memory. This magical pass is used as an aid to release the memory of movements,or to facilitate retaining the memory of new ones. 7. Stirring Energy with the Knees The knee of the left leg is bent and swung to the right as far as it can reach,as if to give a sideways kick with the knee, while the trunk and the arms arcgently twisted as far as possible in the opposite direction (fig. 27).img29.png[images/img29.png] The left leg is then brought back to a standing position. Thesame movement is performed with the right knee, alternating then back and forth. 8. Pushing the Energy Stirred with the Knees into the TrunkThis magical pass is the energetic continuation of the preceding one. The leftknee, bent to the maximum, is pushed up as far as possible into the trunk. Thetrunk is bent slightly forward. At the moment the knee is pushed up, the tip ofthe foot points to the ground (fig. 28).img30.png [images/img30.png] The samemovement is performed with the right leg, alternating then between the two legs.Pointing the foot to the ground ensures that the tendons of the ankles aretense, in order to jolt minute centers there where energy accumulates. Shamansconsider those centers to be perhaps the most important in the lower limbs, soimportant that they could awaken the rest of the minute energy centers in thebody through the performance of this magical pass. This magical pass and thepreceding one are executed together for the purpose of projecting the energy forintending gathered with the knees up into the two centers of vitality around theliver and the pancreas. 9. Kicking Energy in Front and in Back of the BodyA front kick of the left leg is followed by a hook kick to the back with theright leg (figs. 29, 30).img31.png [images/img31.png] img32.png[images/img32.png]Then the order is reversed and a front kick is made with theright leg, followed by a hook kick to the back with the left leg.The arms are kept to the sides, because this magical pass engages only the lowerlimbs, giving them flexibility. The aim is to lift the leg that kicks to thefront as high as possible, and the leg that kicks to the back also as high aspossible. When executing the back kick, the trunk should bend slightly forwardto facilitate the movement. This slight bending forward of the trunk is used asa natural means of absorbing the energy stirred with the limbs.This magical pass is performed to aid the body when problems of digestion arise,due to a change in diet, or when there is a need to travel over great distances. 10. Lifting Energy from the Soles of the FeetThe left knee is bent acutely as it is lifted toward the trunk, as far up aspossible. The trunk is bent slightly forward, almost touching the knee. The armsjut down, making a vise that grabs the sole of the foot (fig. 31).img33.png[images/img33.png] The ideal would be to grab the sole of the foot in a verylight fashion, releasing it immediately. The foot comes down to the ground asthe arms and hands, with a powerful jolt that engages the shoulders and pectoralmuscles, lift up along the sides of the legs to the level of the pancreas andspleen (fig. 32).img34.png [images/img34.png] The same movements are performedwith the right foot and arm, lifting the hands from the feet to the level of theliver and gallbladder. The movements are performed alternating between the twolegs.As in the case of the previous magical pass, bending the trunk forward allowsthe energy from the soles of the feet to be transferred to the two vital centersof energy around the liver and the pancreas.This magical pass is used to aid the attainment of flexibility, and to relieveproblems of digestion. Shamans call the last five magical passes of this group Steps in Nature. Theyare magical passes that practitioners can perform as they walk, or conductbusiness, or even as they are sitting, talking to people. Their function isgathering energy with the feet and using it with the legs for situations inwhich concentration and the quick use of memory are required. 11. Pushing Down a Wall of EnergyThe left foot, with the knee acutely bent, is lifted to the height of the hips;then it pushes forward with the tip of the foot arched upward, as if pushingaway a solid object (fig. 33).img35.png [images/img35.png] As soon as the footis brought down, the right foot is lifted in the same fashion and the movementis repeated, alternating the feet. 12. Stepping Over a Barrier of EnergyThe left leg is nimbly lifted as if going over a hurdle which is locatededgewise in front of the body. The leg makes a circle from left to right (fig.34), img36.png [images/img36.png]and once the foot lands, the other leg islifted to perform the same movement. 13. Kicking a Lateral GateThis is a kick-push with the soles of the feet. The left leg is lifted tomid-calf and the foot pushes to the right of the body as if to hit a solidobject, using the total sole of the foot as a striking surface (fig.35).img37.png [images/img37.png] The foot is retrieved then to the left side,and the same movement is repeated with the right leg and foot. 14. Cracking a Nugget of EnergyThe left foot is lifted with the tip pointing acutely to the ground. The kneeprotrudes straight forward, deeply bent. Then the foot descends with acontrolled motion, striking toward the ground as if it were cracking a nugget(fig. 36).img38.png [images/img38.png] Once the tip of the foot strikes, thefoot is returned to its original standing position and the same movement isrepeated with the other leg and foot. 15. Scraping Off the Mud of EnergyThe left foot is lifted a few inches above the ground; the entire leg is broughtforward and then pushed backward sharply, with the foot lightly brushing theground as if it were scraping something off the sole of the foot (fig.37).img39.png [images/img39.png] The weight of the body is carried by theopposite leg, and the trunk leans a bit forward in order to engage the musclesof the stomach as this magical pass is executed. Once the left foot returns toits normal position, the same movement is repeated with the right foot and leg.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The First Series: Second Group: Stirring Up Energy for IntentThe ten magical passes of the second group have to do with stirring up energyfor intending from areas just below the knees, above the head, around thekidneys, the liver and pancreas, the solar plexus, and the neck. Each of thesemagical passes is a tool that stirs up exclusively the energy pertinent tointending, which is accumulated on those areas. Shamans consider these magicalpasses to be essential for daily living, because for them, life is ruled byintent. This set of magical passes is perhaps for shamans what a cup of coffeeis for modern man: The slogan of the day, \"I'm not myself until I drink mycappuccino,\" or the slogan of a past generation, \"I'm not awake until I drink mycup of Java,\" is rendered for them as \"I am not ready for anything until I haveperformed these magical passes.\" The second group of this series begins by theact that has been termed turning the body on. (See three pages back: \"Six Seriesof Tensegrity\", figs. 15, 16.) 16. Stirring Up Energy with the Feet and the ArmsAfter the body has been turned on, it is held in a slightly stooped-overposition (fig. 38).img40.png [images/img40.png] The weight is placed on theright leg while the left leg makes a complete circle, brushing the ground withthe tips of the toes, and landing on the ball of the foot, in front of the body.The left arm, in synchronization with the leg, makes a circle, the top of whichgoes above the level of the head (fig. 39).img41.png [images/img41.png] There isa slight pause of the leg and arm and they draw two more circles in succession,making a total of three (fig. 40).img42.png [images/img42.png] The rhythm ofthis magical pass is given by counting one, slight pause, one-one, then a veryslight pause, two, pause, two-two, then a very slight pause, and so on. The samemovement is performed with the right leg and arm.This magical pass stirs energy at the bottom of the luminous ball with the feet,and projects it with the arms to the area just above the head. 17. Rolling Energy on the AdrenalsThe forearms are placed behind the body, over the area of the kidneys andadrenals. The elbows are bent at a ninety-degree angle and the hands are held infists, a few inches away from the body, without touching it. The fists movedownward in a rotational fashion, one on top of the other, beginning with theleft fist moving downward; the right fist follows, moving downward as the leftfist moves back up. The trunk leans slightly forward (fig. 41).img43.png[images/img43.png] Then the movement is reversed, and the fists roll in theopposite direction as the trunk leans slightly backward (fig. 42).img44.png[images/img44.png] Leaning the body forward and backward in this fashion engagesthe muscles of the upper arms and the shoulders.This magical pass is used to supply the energy of intending to the adrenals andkidneys. 18. Stirring up Energy for the AdrenalsThe trunk is bent forward, with the knees protruding beyond the line of thetoes. The hands rest above the kneecaps, the fingers draping over them. The lefthand then rotates to the right over the kneecap, making the elbow protrude asfar forward as possible in alignment with the left knee (fig. 43).img45.png[images/img45.png] At the same time, the right forearm, with the hand stillabove the kneecap, rests us full length over the right thigh, while the rightknee is straightened engaging the hamstring. It is important to move only theknees, and not to swing the rear end from side to side. The same movements are performed with the right arm and leg (fig. 44).img46.png[images/img46.png] This magical pass is employed for stirring up the energy ofintending around the kidneys and adrenals. It brings the practitioner long-rangeendurance and a sensation of daring and self-confidence. 19. Fusing Left and Right EnergyA deep inhalation is taken. A very slow exhalation begins as the left forearm isbrought in front of the shoulders, with the elbow bent at a ninety-degree angle.The wrist is bent backward as acutely as possible, with the fingers pointingforward, and the palm of the hand facing to the right (fig. 45).img47.png[images/img47.png]While the arm maintains this position, the trunk is bent forward sharply untilthe protruding left arm reaches the level of the knees. The left elbow must bekept from sagging toward the floor, and must be maintained away from the knees,and as far forward as possible. The slow exhalation continues, as the right armmakes a full circle over the head and the right hand comes to rest an inch ortwo away from the fingers of the left hand. The palm of the right hand faces thebody and the fingers point toward the floor. The head is facing downward, withthe neck held straight. The exhalation ends, and a deep breath is taken in thatposition. All the muscles of the back and the arms and legs are contracted asthe air is slowly and deeply inhaled (fig. 46).img48.png [images/img48.png]The body straightens up as an exhalation is made, and the complete magical passis started again with the right arm.The maximum stretch of the arms forward permits the creation of an opening inthe energetic vortex of the center of the kidneys and adrenals; such an openingallows the optimal utilization of redeployed energy. This magical pass isessential for the redeployment of energy to that center, which accounts, ingeneral terms, for an overall vitality and youth of the body. 20. Piercing the Body with a Beam of EnergyThe left arm is placed against the body in front of the navel, and the right armjust behind the body at the same level. The wrists are bent sharply, and thefingers point to the floor. The palm of the left hand faces right, and the palmof the right hand faces left (fig. 47).img49.png [images/img49.png] Thefingertips of both hands are raised briskly to point in a straight line forwardand backward. The whole body is tensed and the knees are bent at the instantthat the fingers point forward and backward (fig. 48).img50.png[images/img50.png] The hands are kept in that position for a moment. Then themuscles are relaxed, the legs are straightened, and the arms are swiveled arounduntil the right arm is in front and the left behind. As at the beginning of thismagical pass, the fingertips point to the floor, and are raised again briskly topoint in a straight line forward and backward, again with a light exhalation;the knees are bent. By means of this magical pass, a dividing line isestablished in the middle of the body, which separates left energy and rightenergy. 21. Twisting Energy Over Two Centers of VitalityIt's a good idea to begin by placing the hands facing each other, as a device tokeep the hands in line. The fingers are kept open and clawed, as if to grab thelid of a jar the size of the hand. Then the right hand is placed over the areaof the pancreas and spleen, facing the body. The left hand is placed behind thebody, over the area of the left kidney and adrenal, also with the palm facingthe body. Both wrists are then bent backward sharply, as the trunk turns as farto the left as possible, keeping the knees in place. Next, both hands pivot atthe wrists in unison, in a side-to-side movement, as if to unscrew the lids oftwo jars, one on the pancreas and spleen, and the other on the left kidney (fig.49).img51.png [images/img51.png]The same movement is executed by reversing the order, putting the left hand inthe front, at the level of the liver and gallbladder and the right arm in theback at the level of the right kidney.With the aid of this magical pass, energy is stirred on the three main centersof vitality: the liver and gallbladder, the pancreas and spleen, and the kidneysand adrenals. It is an indispensable magical pass for those who have to be onthe lookout. It facilitates an all-around awareness and it increases thepractitioners' sensibility to their surroundings. 22. The Half-Circle of EnergyA half-circle is drawn with the left hand, commencing in front of the face. Thehand moves slightly to the right until it reaches the level of the rightshoulder (fig. 50).img52.png [images/img52.png] There the hand turns and drawsthe inner edge of a half-circle close to the left side of the body (fig.51).img53.png [images/img53.png] The hand turns again in the back (fig.52)img54.png [images/img54.png] and draws the outer edge of the half-circle,then returns to its initial position (fig. 53).img55.png [images/img55.png] Thecomplete half-circle is slanted from the level of the eyes, in front, to a levelbelow the rear end, in the back. It is important to follow the movement of thehand with the eyes. Once the half-circle drawn with the left arm is completed,another one is drawn with the right arm, surrounding the body in this fashionwith two half-circles. These two half-circles are drawn to stir energy and tofacilitate the sliding of energy from above the head to the region of theadrenals. This magical pass is a vehicle for acquiring intense, sustainedsobriety. 23. Stirring Energy Around the NeckThe left hand, with the palm facing upward, and the right hand, with the palmfacing downward, are placed in front of the body, at the level of the solarplexus. The right hand is on top of the left, nearly touching it. The elbows arebent sharply. A deep breath is taken; the arms are raised slightly as the trunkis made to rotate as far to the left as possible without moving the legs,especially the knees, which are slightly bent in order to avoid any unnecessarystress on the tendons. The head is kept in alignment with the trunk andshoulders. An exhalation begins as the elbows are then gently pulled away fromeach other to a maximum stretch, keeping the wrists straight (fig. 54).img56.png[images/img56.png] An inhalation is taken. An exhalation begins when the head isturned very gently to the back to face the left elbow, and then to the front toface the right elbow; the rotation of the head back and forth is repeated twomore times as the exhalation ends.The trunk is turned to the front, and the hands reverse position there. Theright hand is made to face upward while the left hand is made to face downward,on top of the right one. An inhalation is taken again. The trunk is then turnedto the right, and the same movements are repeated on the right.Shamans believe that a special type of energy for intending is dispersed fromthe center for decisions, located in the hollow V spot at the base of the neck,and that this energy is exclusively gathered with this magical pass. 24. Kneading Energy with a Push of the Shoulder BladesBoth arms are placed in front of the face, at the level of the eyes, with theelbows bent enough to give the arms a bowlike appearance (fig. 55).img57.png[images/img57.png] The trunk is bent forward slightly, in order to allow theshoulder blades to expand laterally. The movement begins by pushing the left armforward while it is kept arched and tense (fig. 56).img58.png [images/img58.png]The right arm follows; and the arms move in an alternating fashion. It isimportant to note that the arms are kept extremely tense. The palms of the handsface forward and the fingertips face each other. The driving force of the armsis created by the deep movement of the shoulder blades and the tenseness of thestomach muscles.Shamans believe that energy on the ganglia around the shoulder blades getseasily stuck and becomes stagnant, bringing about the decay of the center fordecisions, located on the V spot at the base of the neck. This magical pass isemployed to stir that energy. 25. Stirring Energy Above the Head and Cracking ItThe left arm moves in a relaxed fashion, making two and a half circles above andaround the head (fig. 57).img59.png [images/img59.png] Those circles are thencracked with the outer edge of the forearm and the hand, which comes downforcefully, but very slowly (fig. 58).img60.png [images/img60.png] The impact isabsorbed by the stomach muscles, which are tensed at that moment. The muscles ofthe arm are kept fight, in order to avoid injuries to the tendons which couldoccur if the muscles of the arm were loose, or if the arm were whipped. Air isexhaled lightly as the arm strikes downward. The same movement is repeated withthe right arm.The energy stirred and cracked in this fashion is allowed to seep downward overthe entire body. When practitioners are overtired, and can't afford to go tosleep, executing this magical pass dispels sleepiness and brings forth asensation of temporary alertness. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The First Series: Third Group: Gathering Energy for IntentThe nine magical passes of the third group are employed to bring to the threecenters of vitality around the liver, the pancreas, and the kidneys thespecialized energy which has been stirred up by the magical passes of theprevious group. The magical passes of this group must be performed slowly andwith ultimate deliberation. Shamans recommend that the state of mind onexecuting these passes be one of total silence and the unwavering intent togather the energy necessary for intending.All of the magical passes of the third group begin with a fast shake of thehands, which are held at the sides of the body, with the arms hanging at anormal position. The hands shake as if the fingers were vibrating downward,taken by a tremor. A vibration of this nature was thought to be the means tostir energy around the hips and also the means to stimulate minute centers ofenergy where energy could get stagnant on the backs of the hands and the wrists.The overall effect of the first three magical passes of this group is one ofgeneral vitality and well-being, since energy is carried to the three main vitalcenters in the lower part of the body. 26. Reaching for Energy Stirred Below the KneesA small jump forward is made with the left leg, which is propelled by the rightone. The trunk is bent markedly forward, and the left arm is stretched out tograb something that is almost at the floor level (fig. 59).img61.png[images/img61.png] The left leg is then retrieved to a standing position, andthe left palm brushes immediately over the vital center of energy on the right:the liver and gallbladder.The same movement is repeated with the right leg and arm, brushing the palm overthe vital center on the left: the pancreas and spleen. 27. Transporting Front Energy to the AdrenalsA deep inhalation is taken while the hands shake. Then the left arm shootsstraight in front of the body ;it the level of the shoulders with the palm ofthe hand turned toward the left, as all the air is sharply exhaled (fig.60).img62.png [images/img62.png] Next, a very slow inhalation begins while thewrist rotates from left to right, making a complete circle, as if scooping aball of solid matter (fig. 61).img63.png [images/img63.png] Then the inhalationcontinues while the wrist rotates hack again to its initial position with thepalm facing to the left. Next, us if carrying the ball, the left arm makes asemi-circle, keeping the same shoulder level; this movement ends when the backof the bent wrist is placed over the left kidney. It is important that thecontinuous inhalation be made to last for the duration of the swinging of thearm from front to back.As this swinging movement is executed, the right arm makes a circular movementto the front of the body, ending when the hack of the bent wrist is brought totouch the area just above the pubis. The head is turned to the left to face theback (fig. 62).img64.png [images/img64.png] Next, the left hand, which isholding the ball, turns to face the body and smashes the Kill against the leftkidney and adrenal. The palm is then gently rubbed over that area as anexhalation is made.The same movement is executed by reversing the arms and turning the head to theright. 28. Scooping Energy from the Left and the RightThe arms are moved to the sides of the body and then raised with the handscurled inward toward the body, brushing upward against the torso to reach thearmpits, as a deep inhalation is taken (fig. 63).img65.png [images/img65.png]Next, the arms are extended laterally, with the palms down, as the air isexhaled forcefully. A deep inhalation is taken then as the hands are cupped andmade to rotate on the wrists until the palms face up, as if scooping somethingsolid (fig. 64).img66.png [images/img66.png] Next, the hands are brought back tothe shoulder level by bending the elbows sharply as the inhalation continues(fig. 65).img67.png [images/img67.png] This movement engages the shoulder bladesand the muscles of the neck. After holding this position for a moment, the armsare extended laterally again, with a sharp exhalation. The palms face front. Thepalms of the hands are cupped and made to rotate backward, again as if scoopinga solid substance.The slightly cupped hands are brought back to the shoulder level as before.These movements are repeated one more time, for a total of three. The palms thenrub gently over the two vital centers around the liver and around the pancreasas the air is exhaled. 29. Cracking the Circle of EnergyA circle is made by moving the left arm to the right shoulder (fig.66),img68.png [images/img68.png] then close around the front of the body to theback (fig. 67)img69.png [images/img69.png] and out again to in front of the face(fig. 68).img70.png [images/img70.png] This movement of the left arm iscoordinated with the same movement done with the right arm. Both arms move in analternate fashion, creating a slanted circle around the total body. Then abackward step to the left is taken with the right foot, followed by a step tothe right taken with the left foot, so as to turn around to face the oppositedirection. The left arm is arched then around the left side of the circle, as ifthe circle were a solid object movement which the left arm presses against thearmpit and chest area. The right arm then performs the same on the right side,treating the circle as if it were a solid object (fig. 69).img71.png[images/img71.png] A deep breath is taken, and the circle is cracked from bothsides by tensing the whole body, especially the arms, which are brought togetherto the chest.The palms then rub gently on the respective centers of vitality on the front ofthe body as the air is exhaled. The uses of this pass are quite esoteric,because they have to do with the clarity of intent needed for decision making.This magical pass is used for .pleading the energy of decisions accumulatedaround the neck. 30. Gathering Energy from the Front of the Body, Right Above the HeadA deep inhalation is taken as the hands shake. Both arms are brought to level ofthe face with clenched fists, crossed in an X, with the left arm closer to theface, and the inside of the fisted palms toward the face. The arms are thenextended a few inches to the front as the wrists are made to rotate on eachother until the fisted palms are facing down (fig. 70).img72.png[images/img72.png] From this position, the left shoulder and shoulder blade areextended forward, an exhalation begins. The left shoulder is pulled back as theright one comes forward. Next, the crossed arms are lifted above the head andthe exhalation ends.A slow, deep inhalation is taken as the crossed arms make a complete circle,moving to the right around the front of the body, almost to the level of theknees, then to the left, and back to their initial position, right above thehead (fig. 71).img73.png [images/img73.png] Then the arms are forcefullyseparated as a long exhalation begins (fig. 72).img74.png [images/img74.png]From there, the arms move as far back as possible, as the exhalation continues,drawing a circle which is completed when the fists are brought to the front tothe level of the eyes, with the inside of the fisted palms toward the face (fig.73).img75.png [images/img75.png] Then the arms are crossed again. The wristspivot on each other as the hands are opened and are placed against the body, theright hand on the area of the pancreas and spleen, and the left hand on the areaof the liver and gallbladder. The body bends forward at the waist, at aninety-degree angle, as the exhalation ends (fig. 74).img76.png[images/img76.png]The use of this magical pass is twofold: First, it stirs energy around theshoulder blades and transports it to a place above the head. From there, itmakes the energy circulate in a broad circle that touches the edges of theluminous sphere. Second, it mixes the energy of the left and the right byplacing it on the two centers of vitality around the pancreas and the liver,with each hand on the opposite center.Mixing energy in such a fashion provides a jolt of great magnitude to therespective centers of vitality. As the practitioners became more proficient intheir practice, the jolt becomes more acute, and acquires the quality of afilter of energy, which is an incomprehensible statement until this pass ispracticed. The sensation that accompanies it could be described as breathingmentholated air. 31. Stirring and Grabbing Energy from Below the Knees and Above the HeadAn inhalation is taken as the hands shake. Both hands are brought up by thesides of the body to the level of the waist, and held relaxed. The knees arebent as the left hand is pushed downward with the wrist turned so that the palmfaces outward, away from the body, as if it were reaching into a bucket full ofliquid substance. This movement is performed at the same time that the righthand shoots up above the head with equal force; the right wrist is also turnedso that the palm faces outward, away from the body (fig. 75).img77.png[images/img77.png] A slow exhalation begins when both arms reach their maximumextension. The wrists are returned with great force to a straight position atthe same time that the hands clasp into fists, as if grabbing something solid.Keeping the fists clenched, the exhalation continues while the right arm isbrought down and the left arm is brought up to the level of the waist, slowlyand with great strength, as if wading through a heavy liquid (fig. 76).img78.png[images/img78.png] Then the palms rub gently on the areas of the liver andgallbladder and the pancreas and spleen. The knees are straightened and theexhalation ends at this point (fig. 77).img79.png [images/img79.png] The samemovement is executed by shifting the arms; the right arm plunges downward whilethe left arm pushes upward.The energy for intending that is extracted from below the knees and above thehead in this magical pass can also be rubbed on the areas of the left and rightkidneys. 32. Mixing Energy of the Left and the RightAn inhalation is taken as the hands shake. The left arm reaches diagonally tothe extreme right above the head and in line with the right shoulder as anexhalation begins (fig. 78).img80.png [images/img80.png] The hand grabs as ifclasping a handful of matter, yanks it out, and brings it to a position abovethe head and in line with the left shoulder, where the exhalation ends. The lefthand remains clasped, and a sharp inhalation is taken as the left arm circlesbackward (fig. 79),img81.png [images/img81.png] ending in a fisted position atthe level of the eyes. The fist is then brought down with an exhalation to thevital center around the pancreas, slowly, but with great force, and the palmrubs softly on that area (fig. 80).img82.png [images/img82.png]The same movement is repeated with the right arm, but instead of moving in abackward circle, the right arm moves in a frontward circle.In the belief of shamans, the energy of the two sides of the body is different.The energy of the left is portrayed as being undular, and the energy of theright as being circular. This magical pass is used to apply circular energy tothe left and undular energy to the right in order to strengthen the centers ofvitality around the liver and pancreas by the inflow of slightly differentenergy. 33. Grabbing Energy from Above the Head for the Two Vital CentersStarting at the level of the ear, the left arm circles forward twice (fig.81)img83.png [images/img83.png] and is then extended over the head, as if tograb something (fig. 82).img84.png [images/img84.png] As this movement isexecuted, a deep breath is taken, winch ends at the moment that the hand grabsupward as if to fetch something above the head. Don Juan recommended that theeyes select, with a quick glance upward, the target for the hand to grab.Whatever is selected and grabbed is then yanked forcefully downward and placedover the vital center around the pancreas and spleen. The air is exhaled at thispoint. The same movement is performed with the right arm, and the energy isplaced over the center around the liver and gallbladder.According to shamans, the energy of intent tends to gravitate downward, and amore rarefied aspect of the same energy remains in the area above the head. Thisenergy is gathered with this magical pass. 34. Reaching for Energy Above the HeadThe left arm is extended upward as far as possible, with the hand open as if tograb something. At the same time, the body is propelled upward with the rightleg. When the jump reaches its maximum height, the hand turns inward at thewrist, making a hook with the forearm (fig. 83),img85.png [images/img85.png]which then slowly and forcefully scoops downward. The left hand rubs immediatelyaround the vital center of the pancreas and spleen. This movement is performed with the right arm in exactly the same fashion as itwas done with the left. The right hand immediately brushes across the vitalcenter around the liver and gallbladder.Shamans believe that the energy stored around the periphery of the luminoussphere that human beings are can be stirred and gathered by jumping forcefullyupward. This magical pass is used as a help to dispel problems brought about byconcentrating on a given task for long periods of time.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The First Series: Fourth Group: Breathing In the Energy of IntentThe three magical passes of this group are for stirring, gathering, andtransporting energy for intent from three centers- around the feet, on theankles, and right below the kneecaps- and placing it on the centers of vitalityaround the kidneys, the liver, the pancreas, the womb, and the genitals. Therecommendation to practitioners on the execution of these magical passes is thatsince they are accompanied by breaths, the inhalations and exhalations should beslow and profound; and that there should be a crystal clear intent on the partof the practitioners that the adrenals receive an instantaneous boost while thedeep breaths are taken. 35. Dragging Energy from the Kneecaps Along the Front of the ThighsA deep inhalation is taken as the arms hang by the sides and the hands waver ina continuous tremor, as if stirring a gaseous matter. An exhalation begins asthe hands are lifted to the waist, and the palms of the hands strike down inunison, on each side of the body, with great force (fig. 84).img86.png[images/img86.png] The arms are only slightly bent, so that the palms of thehands are a few inches below the stomach. The hands are three or four inchesapart, held at ninety-degree angles with the forearms, the fingers pointingforward. Slowly and without touching, the hands make one circle inward towardthe front of the body; the muscles of the arms, stomach, and legs are fullycontracted (fig. 85).img87.png [images/img87.png] A second circle is drawn inthe same fashion as the air is totally expelled through clenched teeth.Another deep inhalation is taken, and the air is slowly exhaled as three moreinward circles are drawn in front of the body. The hands are then retrieved tothe front of the hips, and they slide down the front of die thighs with theheels of the palms, fingers slightly turned up, all the way to the kneecaps. Theair is fully exhaled then. A third deep inhalation is taken while the tips ofthe fingers press the bottom of the kneecaps. The head is held facing downward,in line with the spine (fig. 86).img88.png [images/img88.png] Then, as the bentknees are straightened, the hands, with the fingers clawed, are dragged up thethighs to the hips, as the air is slowly exhaled. With the last portion of theexhalation, the hands are then brushed on the respective centers of vitalityaround the pancreas and the liver. 36. Dragging Energy from the Sides of the LegsA deep inhalation is taken as the hands, held by the sides of the body, shakewith a continuous tremor. The hands strike down exactly as in the previousmagical pass. An exhalation begins there, while the hands draw, in a similarfashion, two small outward circles by the sides of the body. The muscles of thearms, stomach, and legs are tensed to the maximum. The elbows are held fight butslightly bent (fig. 87).img89.png [images/img89.png]After the two circles have been drawn, all the air is expelled, and a deepinhalation is taken. Three more outward circles are drawn as the air is slowlyexhaled. The hands are then brought to the sides of the hips. The fingers areslightly raised as the heels of the hands rub all the way down the sides of thelegs until the fingers reach the outside knobs of the ankles. The head is facingdownward, in line with the body (fig. 88).img90.png [images/img90.png] Theexhalation ends there, and a deep inhalation is taken with the index and middlefingers pressing the bottom of the knobs (fig. 89).img91.png [images/img91.png]A slow exhalation begins as the hands, with the fingers clawed, are dragged upthe sides of the legs to the hips. The exhalation is completed while the palmsare brushed on the two respective centers of vitality. 37. Dragging Energy from the Front of the LegsAgain, a deep inhalation is taken as the hands, held by the sides of the body,are shaken. Both arms make a circle by the sides of the body, beginning towardthe back, and going over the head (fig. 90)img92.png [images/img92.png] tostrike forcefully in front of the body with the palms down and the fingerspointing forward. A slow exhalation begins there, while the hands, starting withthe left, move forward and backward three times in alternating succession, as ifsliding over a smooth surface. The exhalation ends when the heels of both handsare touching the rib cage (fig. 91).img93.png [images/img93.png] A deepinhalation is taken then. The left hand moves in a sliding motion to the leftfollowed by the right hand sliding to the right; this sequence is executed atotal of three times in alternating succession. They end with the heels of thepalms against the rib cage, the thumbs nearly touching each other (fig.92).img94.png [images/img94.png] Next, both hands are made to slide down thefront of the legs until they reach the tendons on the front of the ankles (fig.93).img95.png [images/img95.png]The exhalation ends there. A deep inhalation is taken as the tendon is tensed bylifting the big toe until the tendon seems to pop/up; the index and middlefingers of each hand vibrate the tendons by pressing on them (fig. 94).img96.png[images/img96.png] With the fingers clawed, the hands are dragged up the frontof the legs to the hips as a slow exhalation begins. The palms are gently rubbedon the centers of vitality as the exhalation ends. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"The Second Series: The Series for the WombAccording to don Juan Matus, one of the most specific interests of the shamanswho lived in Mexico in ancient times was what they called the liberation of thewomb.He explained that the liberation of the womb entailed the awakening of itssecondary functions. The primary function of the womb under normal circumstancesis reproduction, but sorcerers are solely concerned with what they consider tobe the womb's secondary function of evolution.This evolution is the awakening and full exploitation of the womb's capacity toutilize direct knowledge by apprehending sensory data directly, and interpretingthose perceptions directly without the aid or need of the processes ofinterpretation with which we are familiar.The women practitioners are transformed from beings that have been 'socializedto reproduce' into beings 'capable of evolving' at the moment they becomeconscious of perceiving energy as it flows in the universe.The womb's characteristics allow females to perceive energy directly morereadily than males. However, in spite of this facility, under normal socialconditions it is nearly impossible for women, or men for that matter, to becomedeliberately conscious that they perceive energy directly. The reason for thisseeming incapacity is something which shamans consider to be a travesty; thefact that there is no one to point out to human beings that it is natural forthem to perceive energy directly.Shamans maintain that women, because they have a womb, are so versatile and soindividualistic in their ability to see energy directly that thisaccomplishment, which should be a triumph of the human spirit, is taken forgranted. Women are almost never conscious of their ability.Since it is more difficult for men to see energy directly, when they doaccomplish this feat, they don't take it for granted. Therefore, male sorcererswere the ones who who tried to describe the phenomenon. \"The basic premise of sorcery,\" don Juan said to me one day, \"discovered by theshamans of my lineage who lived in Mexico in ancient times is that we areperceivers. The totality of the human body is an instrument of perception.However, the predominance of the visual in us gives to perception the overallmood of the eyes. This mood, according to the old sorcerers, is merely theheritage of a purely predatorial state.\"The effort of the old sorcerers, which has lasted to our days,\" don Juancontinued, \"was geared toward placing themselves beyond the realm of thepredator's eye. They conceived the predator's eye to be visual par excellence,and that the realm beyond the predator's eye is the realm of pure perception,which is not visually oriented.\" On another occasion, he said that it was a bone of contention for the sorcerersof ancient Mexico that women, who have the organic frame, the womb, that couldfacilitate their entrance into the realm of pure perception, have no interest inusing it. Those shamans viewed it as a woman's paradox to have endless power ather disposal and no interest whatsoever in gaining access to it. However, donJuan had no doubt that this lack of desire to do anything wasn't natural; it waslearned.The aim of the magical passes for the womb is to give the female practitionersof Tensegrity an inkling, which has to be more than an intellectual titillation,of the possibility of canceling out the effect of this noxious socializationthat renders women indifferent. Nevertheless, a warning is in order; don JuanMatus advised his female disciples to proceed with great caution when practicingthese magical passes. The magical passes for the womb are passes that foster theawakening of the secondary functions of the uterus and ovaries, and thosesecondary functions are the apprehension of sensory data and the interpretationof them.Don Juan called the womb the perceiving box. He was as convinced as the othersorcerers of his lineage that the uterus and ovaries, if they are pulled out ofthe reproductive cycle, can become tools of perception, and become indeed theepicenter of evolution.He considered that the first step of evolution is the acceptance of the premisethat human beings are perceivers. It was not redundancy on his part to insistceaselessly that this realization has to be come before anything else.\"We already know that we are perceivers. What else can we be?\" I would say inprotest every time he insisted.\"Think about it!\" he would reply every time I protested. \"Perception plays onlya minute role in our lives, and yet, the only thing we are for a fact isperceivers. Human beings apprehend energy at large and turn it into sensorydata. Then they interpret these sensory data into the world of everyday life.This interpretation is what we call perception.\"The shamans of ancient Mexico, as you already know,\" don Juan went on, \"wereconvinced that interpretation took place on a point of intense brilliance, theassemblage point, which they found when they saw the human body as aconglomerate of energy fields that resembled a sphere of luminosity.\"The advantage of women is their capacity to transfer the interpretationfunction of the assemblage point to the womb. The result of this transferfunction is something that cannot be talked about, not because it is somethingforbidden, but because it is something indescribable.\"The womb,\" don Juan continued, \"is veritably in a chaotic state of turmoilbecause of this veiled capacity that exists in remission from the moment ofbirth until death and which typically is never utilized. This function ofinterpretation never ceases to act and yet it has never been raised to the levelof full consciousness.\"Don Juan's assurance was that the shamans of ancient Mexico, by means of theirmagical passes, had raised among their female practitioners the interpretivecapacity of the womb to the level of consciousness, and by doing this, they hadinstituted an evolutionary change among them; that is to say, they had turnedthe womb from an organ of reproduction into the tool of evolution.Evolution is defined in the world of modern man as the capacity of differentspecies to modify themselves through the processes of natural selection or thetransmission of traits, until they can successfully reproduce in their offspringthe changes brought about in themselves.The evolutionary theory that has lasted to our day, from the time it wasformulated over a hundred years ago, says that the origin and the perpetuationof a new species of animal or plant is brought about by the process of naturalselection, which favors the survival of individuals whose characteristics renderthem best adapted to their environment, and that the evolution is brought aboutby the interplay of three principles: first, heredity, the conservative forcethat transmits similar organic forms from one generation to another; second,variation, the differences present in all forms of life; and third, the strugglefor existence, which determines which variations confer advantages in a givenenvironment. This last principle gave rise to the phrase still in current use:\"the survival of the fittest.\"Evolution, as a theory, has enormous loopholes; it leaves tremendous room fordoubt. It is at best an open-ended process for which scientists have createdclassificatory schemes; they have created taxonomies to their hearts' content.But the fact remains that it is a theory full of holes. What we know aboutevolution doesn't tell us what evolution is.Don Juan Matus believed that evolution was the product of intending at a veryprofound level. In the case of sorcerers, that profound level was marked by whathe had called inner silence.\"For instance,\" he said, when he was explaining this phenomenon, \"sorcerers aresure that dinosaurs flew because they intended flying. But what is verydifficult to understand, much less accept, is that wings are only one solutionto flying, in this case, the dinosaurs' solution. Nevertheless, this solution isnot the only one that is possible. It's the only one available to us byimitation. Our airplanes are flying with wings imitating the dinosaurs, perhapsbecause flying has never been intended again since the dinosaurs' time. Perhapswings were adopted because they were the easiest solution.\"Don Juan was of the opinion that if we were to intend it now, there is no way ofknowing what other options for flying would be available besides wings. Heinsisted that because intent is infinite, there was no logical way in which themind, following processes of deduction or induction, could calculate ordetermine what these options for flying might be.The magical passes of the Series for the Womb are extremely potent, and shouldbe practiced sparingly. In ancient times, men were barred from executing them.In more recent times, there has been a tendency among sorcerers to render thesemagical passes more generic, and thus the possibility arose that they could alsobe of service to men. This possibility, however, is very delicate and requirescareful handling, great concentration, and determination.The male practitioners of Tensegrity who teach the magical passes have opted,because of their potent effect, to practice them by brushing the energy thatthey generate only lightly on the area of the genitals themselves. This measurehas proven to he enough to provide a beneficial jolt without any profound ordeleterious effects.Don Juan explained that the sorcerers of his lineage, at a given moment, allowedmales to practice these magical passes because of the possibility that theenergy engendered by them would awaken the secondary function of the male sexualorgans. He said that those sorcerers considered that the secondary function ofthe male sexual organs is not at all similar to that of the womb; nointerpretation of sensory data can take place because the male sexual organshang outside of the cavity of the body. Because of these particularcircumstances, their conclusion was that the secondary function of the maleorgans is something which they termed evolutionary support: a sort ofspringboard that catapults men to perform extraordinary feats of what sorcerersof ancient Mexico called unbending intent, or clearheaded purpose andconcentration.The Series for the Womb is divided into four sections which correspond to thethree female disciples of don Juan Matus: Taisha Abelar, Horinda Donner-Grau,and Carol Tiggs; and to the Blue Scout, who was born into don Juan's world.The first is composed of three magical passes belonging to Taisha Abelar; thesecond is composed of one magical pass directly related to Florinda Donner-Grau;the third, of three magical passes that have to do exclusively with Carol Tiggs;and the fourth, of five magical passes that belong to the Blue Scout. Themagical passes of each section are pertinent to a specific type of individual.Tensegrity has rendered them capable of being utilized by anybody, although theyare still slanted in the direction of the type of person that each of those fourwomen is.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Second Series: First Group: Magical Passes Belonging to Taisha AbelarThe three magical passes of this group are geared to gathering energy for thewomb from six specific areas: the left and right front of the body, the left andright sides of the body at the height of the hips, and from behind the shoulderblades and above the head. The explanation that The shamans of ancient Mexicogave was that energy especially suited for the womb accumulates on those areas,and that the movements of these magical passes are the appropriate antennas thatgather that energy exclusively. 1. Extracting Energy from the Front of the Body with the Index and MiddleFingersThe first sensation that a Tensegrity practitioner seeks while executing thismagical pass is a pressure on the tendons of the back of the hand, a sensationwhich is obtained by opening the index and middle fingers as far as possiblewhile they are fully extended. The last two fingers are curled over the palm ofthe hand, and the thumb holds them in place (fig. 95).img97.png[images/img97.png]The magical pass starts by placing the left foot in front of the body in a Tposition, perpendicular to the right one. The left arm and the left leg make aseries of synchronized forward circling movements. The leg circles by firstlifting the ball of the foot, and then the whole foot, and a step is taken thatrolls forward in the air and ends on the heel, with the toes up, as the bodyleans forward, creating pressure on a muscle on the front of the left calf.In synchronization with this movement, the left arm rotates forward over thehead, also making a complete circle. The index and middle fingers are fullyextended, and the palm faces to the right. The pressure on the tendons of theback of the hand has to be maintained with maximum stress during the entiremovement (fig. 96).img98.png [images/img98.png] At the end of the third circlingmovement of the arm and foot, the entire foot is placed on the ground with aforceful stomp, shifting the weight of the body forward. At the same time, thearm shoots out in a stabbing motion, with the index and middle fingers fullyextended and the palm of the hand facing right; the muscles of the entire leftside of the body are kept tense and contracted (fig. 97).img99.png[images/img99.png]An undulating movement is made, as if drawing, with the two extended fingerspointing forward, a letter S that is lying on its side. The wrist is bent sothat the fingers point upward once the S is completed (fig. 98).img100.png[images/img100.png] Next, the wrist bends so the fingers again point forward andthe S is cut in half with a horizontal stroke of the two fingers from right toleft. Then the wrist is bent so the two fingers point upward once more, and asweeping movement is made from left to right with the palm turned toward theface. The palm of the hand is turned to face outward, as the arm sweeps fromright to left. The left arm is retrieved to the level of the chest, and twoforward stabbing motions are executed with the fingers fully extended and thepalm of the hand facing downward. The palm of the hand is turned toward the faceonce more, and the hand sweeps again from left to right and from right to left,exactly as before.The body leans back slightly, shifting the weight to the back leg. Then thehand, with the two fingers curved like a claw, reaches out at waist level infront of the body as if to grab something, contracting the muscles and tendonsof the forearm and hand as if forcefully extracting some heavy substance (fig.99).img101.png [images/img101.png] The clawed hand is retrieved to the side ofthe body. All the fingers of the hand are then fully extended, with The thumblocked and the fingers separated at the middle and fourth fingers, making aletter V, which is brushed over the womb, or over the sexual organs, in the caseof men (fig. 100).img102.png [images/img102.png] A quick jump is made to shiftlegs, so that the right foot is in front of the left one, again making a T. Thesame movements are repeated with the right arm and leg. 2. Jumping to Stir Energy for the Womb and Grabbing It with the HandThis magical pass begins by placing the right foot perpendicular to the left onein a T position. A tap is made with the right heel; this tap serves as animpulse for a small hop of the right foot which ends with the right toespointing forward, followed immediately by a one-step lateral hop of the leftfoot that ends with the left heel on the ground, perpendicular to the rightfoot. The rest of the left foot touches the ground, shifting the weight to theleft leg, as the left arm moves in a grabbing motion to clasp something in frontof the body with a clawed hand (fig. 101).img103.png [images/img103.png] Thehand then rubs gently on the area of the left ovary.A tap of the left heel serves as an impulse for a sequence of movements that isa mirror image of the preceding ones.Energy stirred up by the motion of the feet in this magical pass bounces upward,is caught with each hand in turn, and is placed over the uterus and the left andthe right ovaries. 3. Slapping Energy on the OvariesThe third magical pass begins by circling the left arm over the head, to theback, in toward the shoulder blades, and out again to the front until it reachesthe level of the chin; the palm faces up. The hand draws another circle thatgoes up and over toward the right; it continues downward, all the way to theright waist and then sweeps upward over the head, completing the figure of anumber eight. The palm flips to face the front (fig. 102).img104.png[images/img104.png] Then the hand descends forcefully, as if slapping the areajust in front of the left ovary (fig. 103).img105.png [images/img105.png] Thehand then brushes gently on the area of the left ovary. The same pattern isrepeated with the right arm. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Second Series: Second Group: A Magical Pass Directly Related to FlorindaDonner-GrauIn this group, there is only one magical pass. The effect of this magical passis utterly congruous with the personality of Florinda Donner-Grau. Don JuanMatus regarded her as being very straightforward, so to-the-point that sometimesher directness became unbearable. Her activities in the sorcerers' world, as aconsequence of her directness, have always been geared toward the goal ofevolution, or the transformation of the womb from a receptacle and promoter offertility to an organ of awareness, through which thoughts which are not part ofour normal cognition can be processed. 4. Sphinx PawsThis magical pass begins with a quick, deep inhalation. The air is sharplyexhaled with a forceful strike of the wrists to the front of the body. This isachieved with the hands turned downward sharply, at right angles to theforearms; the fingers point to the ground, and the striking surface is the backsof the hands at the wrists. The hands are pulled upward to the level of theshoulders, the palms facing forward, in a straight line with the forearms. Adeep inhalation is taken. The hands are held in this position as the trunk turnsto the left. The hands then strike, with the palms down, to the level of thehips (fig. 104).img106.png [images/img106.png] The air is exhaled sharply. Thehands are raised above the shoulders again as the trunk turns to the front, anda deep inhalation is taken. With the hands still above the shoulders, the trunkis turned to the right. Next both hands strike, with the palms down, to thelevel of the hips as the air is exhaled.Both hands move then to the right of the body, with the palms slightly cuppedand turned to the left, as if to scoop a liquid substance. Both arms move fromright to left to right, drawing the figure of a reclining number eight in frontof the body. This is achieved by first moving the arms all the way to the left,following a twist of the waist, and then returning back to the right, followinga reverse twist of the waist. The slightly cupped palms are turned to face theright, as if to continue scooping a liquid substance in the opposite direction(fig. 105).img107.png [images/img107.png]As the figure eight is completed, the left hand stops to rest on the left hip,while the right arm continues moving to the right; the arm goes up over the headand makes a big loop to the back that ends when the hand is brought back to thefront, to the level of the chin; the palm of the hand faces up. The handcontinues moving, making another loop to the left, going in front of the face,over the left shoulder. Next it moves in a straight line across the body at thelevel of the hip, cutting through the figure eight (fig. 106).img108.png[images/img108.png] From there, the palm moves back toward the body and is madeto slide over the right ovary, as if the hand were a knife that comes to rest inits sheath.The exact same movements are performed, but striking to the right side of thebody first, in order to allow the left arm to execute the last movement.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Second Series: Third Group: Magical Passes That Have to Do Exclusively withCarol TiggsThe three magical passes of the third group deal with the energy that isdirectly on the area of the womb. This emphasis makes these three magical passesextraordinarily potent. Moderation is strongly recommended in order to bring thesensations of awakening the womb to a manageable level. In this fashion thelinear-minded interpretation of these sensations as premenstrual pangs orheaviness on the ovaries can be avoided.Don Juan Matus told his three female disciples that the secondary functions ofthe womb, upon being awakened by the appropriate magical passes, give thesensorial input of discomfort, but that what takes place at an energetic levelis the influx of energy into the vortex of the womb. Energy which has, up tothis point, remained unused and on the periphery of the luminous sphere issuddenly dropped into that vortex. 5. Packing Energy on the WombThe first magical pass begins by bringing the two hands to the area of the womb.The wrists are bent sharply, and the hands are cupped, the lingers pointing tothe womb.The two hands are extended so that the tips of the fingers point inward eachother. Then they make an ample circle, first going upward and out, and thendown, with both hands together, ending right over the womb (fig. 107).img109.png[images/img109.png] Next, the hands separate to the width of the body (fig.108),img110.png [images/img110.png] and are brought forcefully toward the centerof the womb as if thick ball were being squashed. The same movement is repeated,and the hands are brought closer together, as if the ball were being furthersquashed. Then it is torn apart by a powerful movement of the hands, which graband rip (fig. 109).img111.png [images/img111.png] The hands are then brushedover the area of the uterus and the ovaries. 6. Stirring and Guiding Energy Directly into the WombThis magical pass begins with an exhalation as the arms are stretched out infront of the body, with the backs of the hands touching. A deep breath is takenas the arms move laterally away from each other, drawing half-circles which endwith the forearms touching in front of the body at the level of the chest, andthe arms extended forward with the elbows slightly bent. The palms face up. Thenthe trunk bends forward slightly as the forearms move backward so that theelbows are moored on the solar plexus with the forearms still touching, side byside (fig. 110).img112.png [images/img112.png] Next, a slow exhalation begins,which must last through the following movements: The back side of the left wristis placed on top of the inner side of the right wrist, maneuvering the arms tomake the figure of the letter X; the wrists rotate so that the palms circle intoward the body, and then back out to face front, without losing the X shape ofthe wrists; the left hand ends up on top of the right one (fig. 111).img113.png[images/img113.png] The hands are made into fists and separated vigorously (fig.112),img114.png [images/img114.png] and then brought to the area of the left andright ovaries as the exhalation ends. 7. Squeezing Out Injurious Energy from the OvariesThe left hand is held in front of the body with the palm up. The elbow is bentat a right angle and tucked against the rib cage. The index and middle fingersof the left hand are extended while the thumb holds the other two fingersagainst the palm. The two extended fingers of the left hand are grabbed fromunderneath by the right hand, and squeezed as if drawing something from the baseof the two extended fingers of the left hand and making it move to the tips(fig. 113).img115.png [images/img115.png] Then the right hand shakes vigorouslywhatever it drew from those two fingers with a backhanded, downward strikingmotion on the right side of the body. The left thumb releases the other twofingers, and the hand is held in a letter V shape, with the index and middlefingers together, and the fourth and fifth fingers together. The palm of thehand is lightly brushed over the area of the left ovary. The same movements arerepeated with the right hand.For the second part of this magical pass, the trunk is bent sharply forward. Theleft arm hangs in between the legs, the elbow cushioned against the umbilicalregion. Exactly the same movements performed in the first part of the magicalpass are executed again, except this time the two extended fingers of the lefthand are grabbed by the right hand from above (figs. 114, 115).img116.png[images/img116.png]img117.png [images/img117.png] The same movements arerepeated on the right. ================================================================= "},{"pageContent":"The Second Series: Fourth Group: Magical Passes That Belong to the Blue ScoutThe magical passes of this group are the natural conclusion of the whole series.An impersonal mood is the driving force of this group of passes. The inhalationsand exhalations are sharp, but not deep, and the movements are accompanied by anexplosive hissing sound of air being expelled.The value of the Blue Scout's magical passes resides in the capacity of each ofthem to give the womb the hardness that it requires in order to arrive at itssecondary functions, which can be easily defined, in the case of the Blue Scout,as the ability to be alert without pause. The criticism of sorcerers about ournormal state of being is that we seem to be perennially on automatic pilot; wesay things that we don't mean to say, we ignore things that we shouldn't ignore.In other words, we are aware of what surrounds us only in very short spurts.Most of the time, we function on sheer momentum, habit, and that habit is, inessence, to be oblivious to everything. The idea of the sorcerers of ancientMexico was that, in women, the womb is the organ that can resolve this impasse,and for that, it needs to acquire hardness. 8. Drawing Energy from the Front with Insect AntennasThe index and middle fingers are held by the sides of the chest in a letter Vposition, while the thumbs press the other two fingers against the palms; thepalms are up (fig. 116).img118.png [images/img118.png] Next, the palms turndownward, and the two fingers strike out in front of the body, as a sharpexhalation is made, with clenched teeth and a hissing, whistlelike sound (fig.117).img119.png [images/img119.png] A deep inhalation is taken as the hands areretrieved with the palms up to the sides of the chest. The same movement isrepeated one more time, and the palms of the hands are brushed on the area ofthe ovaries, with the fingers separated between the middle and fourth fingers. 9. Drawing Energy from the Sides at an AngleThis magical pass begins by pivoting on the right foot and putting the left legin front, at a forty-five-degree angle. The right foot is the horizontal bar ofthe letter T, and the left foot, the vertical. The body rocks back and forth.Then the left elbow is bent, and the hand is brought to The level of the chestwith the palm up. The index and middle fingers are held in the shape of theletter V. The thumb holds the other two fingers against the palm (fig.118).img120.png [images/img120.png] A strike is made, leaning the body forwardsharply. The palm of the hand turns down as the fingers strike. The air isexhaled with a hiss (fig. 119).img121.png [images/img121.png] An inhalation istaken as the kind retrieves to the side of the chest with the palm up. The palmof the hand is then lightly brushed on the left ovary, with the fingersseparated between the middle and fourth fingers.A jump is taken to switch feet and face a new direction to the right, still at aforty-five degree angle. The same movements arc repeated with the right arm. 10. Drawing Energy Laterally with an Insect CutThe hands are held on the sides of the chest, with the index and middle fingersof each hand in a V shape and the thumbs holding the other two fingers againstthe palms. The palms face up. Remaining at the level of the chest, the hands arepivoted on the heels of the palms and brought to face each other. Next, ahissing exhalation is made as both arms are fully extended laterally, with thepalms facing the front. The index and middle fingers are moved with a cuttingmotion as if they were indeed scissors, as the exhalation ends in a whistlelikefashion (fig. 120).img122.png [images/img122.png] An inhalation is taken as the arms are retrieved; the elbows are down, and thearms come to rest on the sides of the body by the chest hands pointing sideways(fig. 121).img123.png [images/img123.png] Next the hands are pivoted on the heelof the palm so the index and middle fingers point to the front The fingers arethen separated at the middle and fourth fingers, and a hissing exhalation ismade as the palms of the hands brush over the area of the ovaries. 11. Drilling Energy from Between the Feet with Each HandA deep inhalation is taken. A long hissing exhalation follows while the lefthand descends with a rotating movement of the wrist, which makes the handresemble a drill that seems to perforate a substance in front of the bodybetween the legs. Then the index and middle fingers make a two-pronged claw andgrab something from the area between the feet (fig. 122)img124.png[images/img124.png] and pull it upward, with a deep inhalation, to the level ofthe hips. The arm moves over the head to the back of the body and the palm isplaced on the area of the left kidney and adrenal (fig. 123)img125.png[images/img125.png]The left hand is held there while the right hand performs the same movements.Once the right hand is placed on the area of the right kidney and adrenal, aninhalation is taken. The left hand moves over the head to the front of the body,and brushes, with the fingers separated at the middle and fourth fingers, overthe left ovary. This movement of the arm from back to front is accompanied bythe whistlelike sound of a sharp exhalation. Another deep inhalation is taken,and the right hand is brought to the right ovary in the same fashion. 12. Drilling Energy from Between the Feet with Both HandsThis magical pass is similar to the preceding one, except that instead ofperforming the movements separately, the hands execute the drilling movements inunison. Then the index and middle fingers of both hands make two-pronged claws,and grab something from the area between the feet at the same time.They return to the level of the hips, and then circle around the sides of thebody to the area of the kidneys and adrenals; a deep breath is taken as thepalms rub those areas (fig. 124).img126.png [images/img126.png] Then anexhalation is made as the arms draw another circle around the sides of the bodyto the front to brush the area over the left and right ovaries with the fingersof each hand separated at the middle. Again, this movement of the arms from backto front is accompanied by a whistlelike exhalation. ==============================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: The Series of the Five Concerns: The Westwood SeriesOne of the most important series for the practitioners of Tensegrity is calledThe Series of the Five Concerns. A nickname for this series is The WestwoodSeries, given to it because it was taught publicly for the first rime in thePauley Pavilion at the University of California at Los Angeles, which is locatedin an area called Westwood. This series was conceived as an attempt to integratewhat don Juan Matus called the five concerns of the shamans of ancient Mexico.Everything those sorcerers did rotated around five concerns: one, the magicalpasses; two, the energetic center in the human body called the center fordecisions; three, recapitulation, the means for enhancing the scope of humanawareness; four, dreaming, the bona fide art of breaking the parameters ofnormal perception; five, inner silence, the stage of human perception from whichthose sorcerers launched every one of their perceptual attainments. Thissequence of five concerns was an arrangement patterned on The understanding thatthose sorcerers had of the world around them.One of the astounding findings of those shamans, according to what don Juantaught, was the existence in the universe of an agglutinating force that bindsenergy fields together into concrete, functional units. The sorcerers whodiscovered the existence of this force described it as a vibration, or avibratory condition, that permeates groups of energy fields and glues themtogether.In terms of this arrangement of the five concerns of the shamans of ancientMexico, the magical passes fulfill the function of the vibratory condition thoseshamans talked about. When those sorcerers put together this shamanisticsequence of five concerns, they copied the patterning of energy that wasrevealed to them when they were capable of seeing energy as it flows in theuniverse. The binding force was the magical passes. The magical passes were theunit that permeated through the four remaining units and grouped them togetherinto one functional whole.The Westwood Series, following the patterning of the shamans of ancient Mexico,has consequently been divided into four groups, arranged in terms of theirimportance as envisioned by the sorcerers who formulated them: one, the centerfor decisions; two, recapitulation; three, dreaming; four, inner silence. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: First Group: The Center for DecisionsThe most important topic for the shamans who lived in Mexico in ancient times,and for all the shamans of don Juan's lineage, was the center for decisions.Shamans are convinced, by the practical results of their endeavors, that thereis a spot on the human body which accounts for decision making, the V spot- thearea on the crest of the sternum at the base of the neck, where the claviclesmeet to form a letter V. It is a center where energy is rarefied to the point ofbeing tremendously subtle, and it stores a specific type of energy which shamansare incapable of defining.They are utterly certain, however, that they can feel the presence of thatenergy, and its effects. It is the belief of shamans that this special energy isalways pushed out of that center very early in the lives of human beings, and itnever returns to it, thus depriving human beings of something perhaps moreimportant than all the energy of the other centers combined: the capacity tomake decisions.In relation to the issue of making decisions, don Juan expressed the hardopinion of the sorcerers of his lineage. Their observations, over the centuries,had led them to conclude that human beings are incapable of making decisions,and that for this reason, they have created the social order: giganticinstitutions that assume responsibility for decision making. They let thosegigantic institutions decide for them, and they merely fulfill the decisionsalready made on their behalf.The V spot at the base of the neck was, for those shamans, a place of suchimportance that they rarely touched it with their hands; if it was touched, thetouch was ritualistic and always performed by someone else with the aid of anobject. They used highly polished pieces of hardwood or polished bones ofanimals, utilizing the round head of the bone so as to have an object of theperfect contour, the size of the hollow spot on the neck. They would press withthose bones or pieces of wood to create pressure on the borders of that hollowspot. Those objects were also used, although rarely, for self-massage, or forwhat we understand nowadays as accupressure.\"How did they come to find out that that hollow spot is the center fordecisions!\" I asked don Juan once.\"Every center of energy in the body,\" he replied, \"shows a concentration ofenergy; a sort of vortex of energy, like a funnel that actually seems to rotatecounterclockwise from the perspective of the seer who gazes into it. Thestrength of a particular center depends on the force of that movement. If itbarely moves, the center is exhausted, depleted of energy.\"When the sorcerers of ancient times,\" don Juan continued, \"were scanning thebody with their seeing eye, they noticed the presence of those vortexes. Theybecame very curious about them, and made a map of them.\"\"Are there many such centers in the body, don Juan?\" I asked.\"There are hundreds of them,\" he replied, \"if not thousands! One can say that ahuman being is nothing else but a conglomerate of thousands of twirlingvortexes, some of them so very small that they are, let's say, like pinholes,but very important pinholes. Most of the vortexes are vortexes of energy. Energyflows freely through them, or is stuck in them. There are, however, six whichare so enormous that they deserve special treatment. They are centers of lifeand vitality. Energy there is never stuck, but sometimes the supply of energy isso scarce that the center barely rotates.\"Don Juan explained that those enormous centers of vitality were located on sixareas of the body. He enumerated them in terms of the importance that shamansaccorded them.The first was on the area of the liver and gallbladder; the second on the areaof the pancreas and spleen; the third on the area of the kidneys and adrenals;and the fourth on the hollow spot at the base of the neck on the frontal part ofthe body. The fifth was around the womb, and the sixth was on the top of thehead.The fifth center, pertinent only to women, had, according to what don Juan said,a special kind of energy that gave sorcerers the impression of liquidness. Itwas a feature that only some women had. It seemed to serve as a natural filterthat screened out superfluous influences.The sixth center, located on top of the head, don Juan described as somethingmore than an anomaly, and refrained absolutely from having anything to do withit. He portrayed it as possessing not a circular vortex of energy, like theothers, but a pendulumlike, back-and-forth movement somehow reminiscent of thebeating of a heart.\"Why is the energy of that center so different, don Juan?\" I asked him.\"That sixth center of energy,\" he said, \"doesn't quite belong to man. You see,we human beings are under siege, so to speak. That center has been taken over byan invader, an unseen predator. And the only way to overcome this predator is byfortifying all the other centers.\"\"Isn't it a bit paranoiac to feel that we are under siege, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Well, maybe for you, but certainly not for me,\" he replied. \"I see energy, andI see that the energy over the center on the top of the head doesn't fluctuatelike the energy of the other centers. It has a back-and-forth movement, quitedisgusting, and quite foreign. I also see that in a sorcerer who has beencapable of vanquishing the mind, which sorcerers call a foreign installation,the fluctuation of that center has become exactly like the fluctuation of allthe others.\"Don Juan, throughout the years of my apprenticeship, systematically refused totalk about that sixth center. On this occasion when he was telling me about thecenters of vitality, he dismissed my frantic probes, rather rudely, and began totalk about the fourth center, the center for decisions.\"This fourth center,\" he said, \"has a special type of energy, which appears tothe eye of the seer as possessing a unique transparency, something that could bedescribed as resembling water: energy so fluid that it seems liquid. The liquidappearance of this special energy is the mark of a filterlike quality of thecenter for decisions itself, which screens any energy coming to it, and drawsfrom it only the aspect of it that is liquidlike. Such a quality of liquidnessis a uniform and consistent feature of this center. Sorcerers also call it thewatery center.\"The rotation of the energy at the center for decisions is the weakest of themall,\" he went on. \"That's why man can rarely decide anything. Sorcerers see thatafter they practice certain magical passes, that center becomes active, and theycan certainly make decisions to their hearts' content, while they couldn't eventake a first step before.\"Don Juan was quite emphatic about the fact that the shamans of ancient Mexicohad an aversion that bordered on phobia about touching their own hollow spot atthe base of the neck. The only way in which they accepted any interferencewhatsoever with that spot was through the use of their magical passes, whichreinforce that center by bringing dispersed energy to it, clearing away, in thismanner, any hesitation in decision making born out of the natural energydispersion brought about by the wear and tear of everyday life.\"A human being,\" don Juan said, \"perceived as a conglomerate of energy fields,is a concrete and sealed unit into which no energy can be injected, and fromwhich no energy can escape. The feeling of losing energy, which all of usexperience at one time or another, is the result of energy being chased away,dispersed from the five enormous natural centers of life and vitality. Any senseof gaining energy is due to the redeployment of energy previously dispersed fromthose centers. That is to say, The energy is relocated onto those five centersof life and vitality.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: First Group: The Magical Passes for the Center for Decisions1. Bringing Energy to the Center for Decisions with a Back-and Forth Motion ofthe Hands and Arms with the Palms Turned Downward. The arms shoot out to thefront at a forty-five-degree angle with an exhalation, the palms of the handsfacing down (fig. 125).img127.png [images/img127.png] Then they are retrieved tothe sides of the chest, under the axilla, with an inhalation. The shoulders areraised in order to main the same degree of inclination (fig. 126).img128.png[images/img128.png] In the second facet of this movement, the arms are extended downward with aninhalation, and pulled back with an exhalation. 2. Bringing Energy to the Center for Decisions with a Back-and-Forth Motion ofthe Hands and Arms with the Palms Turned UpwardThis magical pass is like the preceding one, and it is executed in exactly thesame fashion, except that it is done with the palms of the hands turned upward(fig. 127).img129.png [images/img129.png] The inhalations and exhalations arealso exactly as in the preceding movement. Air is exhaled as the hands and armsmove forward at a forty-five-degree level of inclination, and it is inhaled asthe arms move backward. Then air is inhaled as the hands and arms move downward,and exhaled as the hands and arms retrieve. 3. Bringing Energy to the Center for Decisions with a Circular Motion of theHands and Arms with the Palms Turned DownwardThis magical pass begins exactly like the first one of this group, except thatwhen the hands reach their fully extended position, two complete circles aredrawn with the hands and the arms going away from each other to reach a pointabout six inches beyond the rib cage. When the hands complete the circles (fig.128),img130.png [images/img130.png] the arms are retrieved to the sides of therib cage under the axilla.This magical pass consists of two facets. In the first, air is exhaled as thecircles are drawn and inhaled as the arms are retrieved backward. In the second,air is inhaled as the hands and arms draw the circles and exhaled as the armsare retrieved. 4. Bringing Energy to the Center for Decisions in a Circular Motion of the Handsand Arms with the Palms Turned UpwardThis magical pass is exactly like the preceding one, with the same two facets ofinhalation and exhalation, but the two circles are drawn by the hands and armswith the palms of the hands turned upward (fig. 129).img131.png[images/img131.png] 5. Bringing Energy to the Center for Decisions from the Midsection of the BodyThe arms are bent at the elbows and kept high, at the level of the shoulders.The fingers are kept loosely pointing toward the V spot, but without touching it(fig. 130).img132.png [images/img132.png] The arms move in a teeter-totterfashion from right to left and left to right. The motion is not accomplished bymoving the shoulders or the hips, but by the contraction of the muscles of thestomach, which moves the midsection to the right, to the left, and to the rightagain, and so on. 6. Bringing Energy to the Center for Decisions from the Area of the ShoulderBladesThe arms are bent, as in the previous movement, hut the shoulders are rounded sothat the elbows are heavily drawn toward the front. The left hand is placed ontop of the right. The fingers are held loose, pointing toward the V spot withouttouching n, and the chin juts out and rests on the hollow spot between the thumband index finger of the left Figure 130 hand (fig. 131).img133.png[images/img133.png] The bent elbows are pushed forward, extending the shoulderblades, one at a time, to the maximum. 7. Stirring Energy Around the Center for Decisions with a Bent WristBoth hands are brought to the V spot on the base of the neck, without touchingit. The hands are gently curved; the fingers point at the center for decisions.Then the hands begin to move, the left first, followed by the right, as ifstirring a liquid substance around that area, or as if they were fanning airinto the V spot with a series of gentle movements of each hand; these movementsare accomplished by extending the whole arm laterally and then bringing it backto the area in front of the V spot (fig. 132).img134.png [images/img134.png]Then the left arm strikes out in front of the V spot, with the hand turnedsharply inward, using the wrist and the back of the hand as a striking surface(fig. 133).img135.png [images/img135.png] The right arm executes the samemovement. In this manner, a series of forceful blows are delivered to the arearight in front of the V spot. 8. Transferring Energy from the Two Centers of Vitality on the Front of the Bodyto the Center for DecisionsBoth hands are brought to the area of the pancreas and spleen, a few inches infront of the body. The left hand, with the palm turned upward, is held four orfive inches below the right one, which has the palm turned downward. The leftforearm is held at a ninety-degree angle, extended straight out to the front.The right forearm is also at a ninety-degree angle, but held close to the body,so that the fingertips point to the left (fig. 134).img136.png[images/img136.png] The left hand makes two inward circles about a foot indiameter around the area of the pancreas and spleen. Once it has completed thesecond circle, the right hand shoots out to the front and strikes with the edgeof the hand, to the area an arm's length in front of the liver and gallbladder(fig.135).img137.png [images/img137.png]The exact same movements are performed on the other side of the body byreversing the position of the hands, which arc brought to the area of the liverand gallbladder, with the right hand circling and the left hand striking forwardto the area an arm's length in front of the pancreas and spleen. 9. Bringing Energy to the Center for Decisions from the KneesThe left hand and arm draw two circles about a foot in diameter in front of theV spot, a bit toward the left (fig. 136).img138.png [images/img138.png] The palmof the hand is facing downward. Once the second circle has been drawn, theforearm is raised to the level of the shoulder and the hand strikes away fromthe (ace, diagonally to the right, at the level of the V spot, with a flick ofthe wrist, as if holding a whip (fig. 137).img139.png [images/img139.png] Thesame movements are performed with the right hand.Then a deep inhalation is taken, and an exhalation follows as the hands and armsslide downward until they reach the tops of the knees, with the palms facing up.A deep inhalation is taken there and the arms are raised, with the left arm inthe lead; the right arm crosses over the left as they go over the head until thefingers rest on the back of the neck. The breath is held as the top of the trunkmoves three times in succession in a teeter-totter motion; the left shouldergoes down first, then the right, and so on (fig. 138).img140.png[images/img140.png] Then the air is exhaled as the arms and hands move backdownward to the tops of the knees, again with the palms of the hands facing up.A deep inhalation is taken, and then the air is exhaled as the hands are raisedfrom the knees to the level of the V spot, with the fingers pointing toward it,without touching it (fig. 139).img141.png [images/img141.png] The hands arebrought once more to the knees with an exhalation. A final deep inhalation istaken and the hands are raised to the level of the eyes, and then brought downto the sides as the air is exhaled.The next three magical passes, according to don Juan, transfer energy whichbelongs only to the center for decisions from the frontal edge of the luminoussphere, where it has accumulated over the years, to the back, and then from theback of the luminous sphere to the front. He said that this energy transferredback and forth goes through the V spot, which acts as a filter, utilizing onlythe energy that is proper to it and discarding the rest. He pointed out thatbecause of this selective process of the V spot, it is essential to performthese three magical passes as many times as possible. 10. Energy Going Through the Center for Decisions from the Front to the Back andthe Back to the Front with Two BlowsA deep inhalation is taken. Then the air is slowly exhaled as the left armstrikes out at the level of the solar plexus, with the palm of the hand turnedupward; the palm is held flat and the fingers are together.Then the hand is clasped into a fist. The arm moves to the back, striking fromthe height of the hips with a backhand blow (fig. 140).img142.png[images/img142.png] The exhalation ends as the hand opens.Another deep inhalation is taken. A slow exhalation follows while the palm ofthe open hand, still in back of the body, taps ten times as if lightly hitting asolid round object. Then the hand is clasped into a fist before the arm moves tothe front in a swinglike punch that strikes an area in front of the V spot, anarm's length away from it (fig. 141).img143.png [images/img143.png] The handopens as if releasing something held in it. The arm moves down, back, and thenover the head and strikes with the palm down in front of the V spot, as ifbreaking whatever it has released. The exhalation ends then (fig.142).img144.png [images/img144.png] The same sequence of movements is repeatedwith the right arm. 11. Transferring Energy from the Front to the Back and the Back to the Frontwith the Hook of the ArmA deep inhalation is made. Then the air is slowly exhaled as the left .inn movesforward with the palm of the hand turned upward. The hand is quickly claspedinto a fist. The fisted hand rotates until the back of the hand is turned upwardand strikes over the shoulder to the back. The fisted palm faces upward. Thehand opens and turns to face downward, and the exhalation ends. Another deepinhalation is taken. Then a slow exhalation begins as the hand, made into adownward hook, scoops three times, as if rolling a solid substance into a ball(fig. 143).img145.png [images/img145.png] The ball is tossed upward to the levelof the head with a flick of the hand and forearm (fig. 144),img146.png[images/img146.png] and quickly grabbed with the hand bent again at the wristlike a hook (fig. 145).img147.png [images/img147.png] The arm moves to thefront, then to the height of the right shoulder and strikes forward to an arearight in front of the V spot an arm's length away from it, using the wrist andthe back of the hand as a striking surface (fig. 146).img148.png[images/img148.png] The hand then opens as if to release whatever it hadtrapped, and the arm moves down to the back and over the head to strike it withgreat force with the flat palm. The exhalation ends as the whole body shakeswith the force of the strike. The same movements are repeated with the otherarm. 12. Transferring Energy from the Front to the Back and the Back to the Frontwith Three BlowsA deep inhalation is taken. A slow exhalation follows as the left arm strikesforward with the hand open, the flat palm turned upward. The hand is quicklyclasped into a fist, and the arm retrieves as if to deliver an elbow blow to theback. Then it moves laterally to the right and delivers a side punch with theforearm rubbing on the body (fig. 147).img149.png [images/img149.png] The elbowis retrieved again as if to deliver an elbow blow to the back. The arm isextended and moved out to the left side and to the back, to deliver the fourthblow behind the body with the back of the fisted hand. The exhalation ends asthe hand opens (fig. 148).img150.png [images/img150.png]A deep inhalation is taken again. A slow exhalation follows as the hand, bentdownward into a hook, scoops three times. Then the hand grabs as if it wereclasping something solid (fig. 149).img151.png [images/img151.png] The armswings to the front at the level of the center for decisions. It continues tothe right shoulder; there the forearm makes a loop upward and delivers aback-fist blow to the area in front of the V spot, an arm's length away from it(fig. 150).img152.png [images/img152.png] The hand opens as if to releasesomething that it was clasping. Then it moves down, goes behind the body, comesabove the head, with the palm of the hand down, and smashes whatever it releasedwith a forceful blow of the open hand. The slow exhalation ends there (fig.151).img153.png [images/img153.png]The same movements are repeated with the right arm.==============================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: Second Group: The RecapitulationThe recapitulation, according to what don Juan taught his disciples, was atechnique discovered by the sorcerers of ancient Mexico, and used by everyshaman practitioner from then on, to view and relive all the experiences oftheir lives, in order to achieve two transcendental goals: one, the abstractgoal of fulfilling a universal code that demands that awareness must berelinquished at the moment of death; and two, the extremely pragmatic goal ofacquiring perceptual fluidity.He said that the formulation of their first goal was the result of observationsthat those sorcerers made by means of their capacity to see energy directly asit flows in the universe. They had seen that there exists in the universe agigantic force, an immense conglomerate of energy fields which they called theEagle, or the dark sea of awareness. They observed that the dark sea ofawareness is the force that lends awareness to all living beings, from virusesto men. They believed that it lends awareness to a newborn being, and that thisbeing enhances that awareness by means of its life experiences until a moment inwhich the force demands its return.In the understanding of those sorcerers, all living beings die because they areforced to return the awareness lent to them. Sorcerers throughout the ages haveunderstood that there is no way for what modern man calls our linear mode ofthinking to explain such a phenomenon, because there is no room for acause-and-effect line of reasoning as to why and how awareness is lent and thentaken back. The sorcerers of ancient Mexico viewed it as an energetic fact ofthe universe, a fact that can't be explained in terms of cause and effect, or interms of a purpose which can be determined a priori.The sorcerers of don Juan's lineage believed that to recapitulate meant to givethe dark sea of awareness what it was seeking: their life experiences. Theybelieved that by means of the recapitulation, however, they could acquire adegree of control that could permit them to separate their life experiences fromtheir life force. For them, the two were not inextricably intertwined; they werejoined only circumstantially.Those sorcerers affirmed that the dark sea of awareness doesn't want to take thelives of human beings; it wants only their life experiences. Lack of disciplinein human beings prevents them from separating the two forces, and in the end,they lose their lives, when it is meant that they lose only the force of theirlife experiences. Those sorcerers viewed the recapitulation as the procedure bywhich they could give the dark sea of awareness a substitute for their lives.They gave up their life experiences by recounting them, but they retained theirlife force.The perceptual claims of sorcerers, when examined in terms of the linearconcepts of our Western world, make no sense whatsoever. Western civilizationhas been in contact with the shamans of the New World for five hundred years,and there has never been a genuine attempt on the part of scholars to formulatea serious philosophical discourse based on statements made by those shamans. Forinstance, the recapitulation may seem to any member of the Western world to becongruous with psychoanalysis, something in the line of a psychologicalprocedure, a sort of self-help technique. Nothing could be further from thetruth.According to don Juan Matus, man always loses by default. In the case of thepremises of sorcery, he believed that Western man is missing a tremendousopportunity for the enhancement of his awareness, and that the way in whichWestern man relates himself to the universe, life, and awareness is only one ofa multiplicity of options.To recapitulate, for shaman practitioners, means to give to an incomprehensibleforce- the dark sea of awareness- the very thing it seems to be looking for:their life experiences, that is to say, the awareness that they have enhancedthrough those very life experiences. Since don Juan could not possibly explainthese phenomena to me in terms of standard logic, he said that all thatsorcerers could aspire to do was to accomplish the feat of training their lifeforce without knowing how it was done. He also said that there were thousands ofsorcerers who had achieved this. They had retained their life force after theyhad given the dark sea of awareness the force of their life experiences. Thismeant to don Juan that those sorcerers didn't die in the usual sense in which weunderstand death, but that they transcended it by retaining their life force andvanishing from the face of the earth, embarked on a definitive journey ofperception.The belief of the shamans of don Juan's lineage was that when death takes placein this fashion, all of our being is turned into energy, a special kind ofenergy that retains the mark of our individuality. Don Juan tried to explainthis in a metaphorical sense, saying that we are composed of a number of singlenations: the nation of the lungs, the nation of the heart, the nation of thestomach, the nation of the kidneys, and so on. Each of these nations sometimesworks independently of the others, but at the moment of death, all of them areunified into one single entity. The sorcerers of don Juan's lineage called thisstate total freedom. For those sorcerers, death is a unifier, and not anannihilator, as it is for the average man.\"Is this state immortality, don Juan?\" I asked.\"This is in no way immortality,\" he replied. \"It is merely the entrance into anevolutionary process, using the only medium for evolution that man has at hisdisposal: awareness. The sorcerers of my lineage were convinced that man couldnot evolve biologically any further; therefore, they considered man's awarenessto be the only medium for evolution. At the moment of dying, sorcerers are notannihilated by death, but are transformed into inorganic beings: beings thathave awareness, but not an organism. To be transformed into an inorganic beingwas evolution for them, and it meant that a new, indescribable type of awarenesswas lent to them, an awareness that would last for veritably millions of years,but which would also someday have to be returned to the giver: the dark sea ofawareness.\"One of the most important findings of the shamans of don Juan's lineage wasthat, like everything else in the universe, our world is a combination of twoopposing, and at the same time complementary, forces. One of those forces is theworld we know, which those sorcerers called the world of organic beings. Theother force is something they called the world of inorganic beings.\"The world of inorganic beings,\" don Juan said, \"is populated by beings thatpossess awareness, but not an organism. They are conglomerates of energy fields,just like we are. To the eye of a seer, instead of being luminous, as humanbeings are, they are rather opaque. They are not round, but long, candlelikeenergetic configurations. They are, in essence, conglomerates of energy fieldswhich have cohesion and boundaries just like we do. They are held together bythe same agglutinating force that holds our energy fields together.\"\"Where is this inorganic world, don Juan?\" I asked.\"It is our twin world,\" he replied. \"It occupies the same time and space as ourworld, but the type of awareness of our world is so different from the type ofawareness of the inorganic world that we never notice the presence of inorganicbeings, although they do notice ours.\"\"Are those inorganic beings human beings that have evolved?\" I asked.\"Not at all!\" he exclaimed. \"The inorganic beings of our twin world have beenintrinsically inorganic from the start, the same way that we have always beenintrinsically organic beings, also from the start. They are beings whoseconsciousness can evolve just like ours, and it doubtlessly does, but I have nofirsthand knowledge of how this happens. What I do know, however, is that ahuman being whose awareness has evolved is a bright, luminescent, roundinorganic being of a special kind.\"Don Juan gave me a series of descriptions of this evolutionary process, which Ialways took to be poetic metaphors. I singled out the one that pleased me themost, which was total freedom. I fancied a human being that enters into totalfreedom to be the most courageous, the most imaginative being possible. Don Juansaid that I was not fancying anything at all - that to enter into total freedom,a human being must call on his or her sublime side, which, he said, human beingshave, but which it never occurs to them to use.Don Juan described the second, the pragmatic goal of the recapitulation as theacquisition of fluidity. The sorcerers' rationale behind this had to do with oneof the most elusive subjects of sorcery: the assemblage point, a point ofintense luminosity the size of a tennis ball, perceivable when sorcerers see ahuman being as a conglomerate of energy fields.Sorcerers like don Juan see that trillions of energy fields in the form offilliments of light from the universe at large converge on the assemblage pointand go through it. This confluence of filaments gives the assemblage point itsbrilliancy. The assemblage point makes it possible for a human being to perceivethose trillions of energy filaments by turning them into sensorial data.The assemblage point then interprets this data as the world of everyday life,that is to say, in terms of human socialization and human potential.To recapitulate is to relive every, or nearly every, experience that we havehad, and in doing so to displace the assemblage point, ever so slightly or agreat deal, propelling it by the force of memory to adopt the position that ithad when the event being recapitulated took place. This act of going back andforth from previous positions to the current one gives the shaman practitionersthe necessary fluidity to withstand extraordinary odds in their journeys intoinfinity. To the Tensegrity practitioners, the recapitulation gives thenecessary fluidity to withstand odds which are not in any way part of theirhabitual cognition.The recapitulation as a formal procedure was done in ancient times byrecollecting every person the practitioners knew and every experience in whichthey had taken part. Don Juan suggested that in my case, which is the case ofmodern man, I make a written list of all the persons that I had met in my life,as a mnemonic device. Once I had written that list, he proceeded to tell me howto use it. I had to take the first person on the list, which went backwards intime from the present to the time of my very first life experience, and set up,in my memory, my last interaction with that first person on my list. This act iscalled arranging the event to be recapitulated.A detailed recollection of minutiae is required as the proper means to honeone's capacity to remember. This recollection entails getting all the pertinentphysical details, such as the surroundings where the event being recollectedtook place. Once the event is arranged, one should enter into the locale itself,as if actually going into it, paying special attention to any relevant physicalconfigurations. If, for instance, the interaction took place in an office, whatshould be remembered is the floor, the doors, the walls, the pictures, thewindows, the desks, the objects on the desks, everything that could have beenobserved in a glance and then forgotten.The recapitulation as a formal procedure must begin by the recounting of eventsthat have just taken place. In this fashion, the primacy of the experience takesprecedence. Something that has just happened is something that one can rememberwith great accuracy. Sorcerers always count on the fact that human beings arecapable of storing detailed information that they are not aware of, and thatthat detail is what the dark sea of awareness is after.The actual recapitulation of the event requires that one breathe deeply, fanningthe head, so to speak, very slowly and gently from side to side, beginning onone side, left or right, whichever. This fanning of the head was done as manytimes as needed, while remembering all the details accessible. Don Juan saidthat sorcerers talked about this act as breathing in all of one's own feelingsspent in the event being recollected, and expelling all the unwanted moods andextraneous feelings that were left with us.Sorcerers believe that the mystery of the recapitulation lies in the act ofinhaling and exhaling. Since breathing is a life-sustaining function, sorcerersare certain that by means of it, one can also deliver to the dark sea ofawareness the facsimile of one's life experiences. When I pressed don Juan for arational explanation of this idea, his position was that things like therecapitulation could only be experienced, not explained. He said that in the actof doing, one can find liberation, and that to explain it was to dissipate ourenergy in fruitless efforts. His invitation was congruous with everythingrelated to his knowledge: the invitation to take action.The list of names is used in the recapitulation as a mnemonic device thatpropels memory into an inconceivable journey. Sorcerers' position in thisrespect is that remembering events that have just taken place prepares theground for remembering events more distant in time with the same clarity andimmediacy. To recollect experiences in this way is to relive them, and to drawfrom this recollection an extraordinary impetus that is capable of stirringenergy dispersed from our centers of vitality, and returning it to them.Sorcerers refer to this redeployment of energy that the recapitulation causes asgaining fluidity after giving the dark sea of awareness what it is looking for.On a more mundane level, the recapitulation gives practitioners the capacity toexamine the repetition in their lives. Recapitulating can convince them, beyondthe shadow of a doubt, that all of us are at the mercy of forces whichultimately make no sense, although at first sight they seem perfectlyreasonable; such as being at the mercy of courtship. It seems that for somepeople, courtship is the pursuit of a lifetime. I have personally heard frompeople of advanced age that the only ideal that they had was to find a perfectcompanion, and that their aspiration was to have perhaps one year of happinessin love.Don Juan Matus used to say to me, over my vehement protests, that the problemwas that nobody really wanted to love anybody, but that every one of us wantedto be loved. He said that this obsession with courtship, taken at face value,was the most natural thing in the world to us. To hear a seventy-five year oldman or woman say that they are still in search of a perfect companion is anaffirmation of something idealistic, romantic, beautiful. However, to examinethis obsession in the context of the endless repetitions of a lifetime makes itappear as it really is: something grotesque.Don Juan assured me that if any behavioral change is going to be accomplished,it has to be done through the recapitulation, since it is the only vehicle thatcan enhance awareness by liberating one from the unvoiced demands ofsocialization, which are so automatic, so taken for granted, that they are noteven noticed under normal conditions, much less examined.The actual act of recapitulating is a lifetime endeavor. It takes years toexhaust the list of people, especially for those who have made the acquaintanceof and have interacted with thousands of individuals. This list is augmented bythe memory of impersonal events in which no people are involved, but which haveto be examined because they are somehow related to the person beingrecapitulated.Don Juan asserted that what the sorcerers of ancient Mexico sought avidly inrecapitulating was the memory of interaction, because in interaction lie thedeep effects of socialization, which they struggled to overcome by any meansavailable. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: Second Group: The Magical Passes for the RecapitulationThe recapitulation affects something that don Juan called the energy body. Heformally explained the energy body as a conglomerate of energy fields that arethe mirror image of the energy fields that make up the human body when it isseen directly as energy. He said that in the case of sorcerers, the physicalbody and the energy body are one single unit. The magical passes for therecapitulation bring the energy body to the physical body, which are essentialfor navigating into the unknown. 13. Forging the Trunk of the Energy BodyDon Juan said that the trunk of the energy body was forged with three strikesdelivered with the palms of the hands. The hands are held at the level of theears with the palms facing forward, and from that position they strike forward,at the level of the shoulders, as if they were striking the shoulders of awell-developed body. The hands then move back to their original position aroundthe ears, with the palms facing forward, and strike the midtrunk of thatimaginary body at the level of the chest. The second strike is not as wide asthe first one, and the third strike is much narrower, because it strikes thewaistline of a triangular-shaped trunk (fig. 152).img154.png [images/img154.png] 14. Slapping the Energy BodyThe left and the right hands each come down from above the head. The palm ofeach hand bears down, creating a current of energy that defines each arm,forearm, and hand of the energy body. The left hand hits across the body tostrike the left hand of the energy body (fig. 153)img155.png [images/img155.png]and then the right hand does the same: it hits across the body to strike theright hand of the energy body. This magical pass defines the arms and forearms,especially the hands, of the energy body. 15. Spreading the Energy Body Laterally The wrists are crossed in the shape of aletter X in front of the body, almost touching it. The wrists are held bentbackwards at a ninety-degree angle to the forearm, at the level of the solarplexus. The left wrist is on top of the right one (fig. 154).img156.png[images/img156.png] From there, the hands spread to the sides in unison, in aslow motion, as if they met with tremendous resistance (fig. 155).img157.png[images/img157.png]When the arms reach their maximum aperture, they are brought back to the center,with the palms turned at a ninety-degree angle in relation to the forearms,creating in this fashion the sensation of pushing solid matter from both sidesto the center of the body. The left hand crosses on top of the right as thehands get ready for another lateral strike.While the physical body as a conglomerate of energy fields has super-definedboundaries, the energy body lacks that feature. Spreading energy laterally givesthe energy body the defined boundaries that it lacks. 16. Establishing the Core of the Energy BodyThe forearms are held in a vertical position at the level of the chest, with theelbows kept in close to the body, at the width of the trunk. The wrists aresnapped back gently, and then forward with great force, without moving theforearms (fig. 156).img158.png [images/img158.png]The human body, as a conglomerate of energy fields, has not only super-definedboundaries, but a core of compact luminosity, which shamans call the band ofman, or the energy fields with which man is most familiar. The idea of shamansis that within the luminous sphere, which is also the totality of man'senergetic possibilities, there are areas of energy of which human beings are notat all aware. Those are the energy fields located at the maximum distance fromthe band of man. To establish the core of the energy body is to fortify theenergy body in order for it to venture into those areas of unknown energy. 17. Forging the Heels and the Calves of the Energy BodyThe left foot is held in front of the body with the heel raised to midcalf. Theheel is turned out to a position perpendicular to the other leg. Then the leftheel strikes to the right as if a kick with the heel were being delivered, aboutsix or seven inches away from the shinbone of the right leg (figs. 157,158).img159.png [images/img159.png]img160.png [images/img160.png]The same movement is then executed with the other leg. 18. Forging the Knees of the Energy BodyThis magical pass has two facets. In the first facet the left knee is bent andraised to the level of the hips, or if possible even higher. The total weight ofthe body is placed on the right leg, which stands with the knee slightly bentforward. Three circles are drawn with the left knee, moving it inward toward thegroin (fig. 159).img161.png [images/img161.png] The same movement is repeatedwith the right leg.In the second facet of this magical pass, the movements are repeated again witheach leg, but I Ins time, the knee draws an outward circle (fig. 160).img162.png[images/img162.png] 19. Forging the Thighs of the Energy BodyBeginning with an exhalation, the body bends slightly at the knees as the handsslide down the thinks. The hands stop on top of the kneecaps, and then they arepulled back up the thighs to the level of the hips with an inhalation, as ifthey were dragging a solid substance. There is a slight quality of a claw toeach hand. The body straightens as this part of the movement is executed (fig.161).img163.png [images/img163.png] With the opposite breathing pattern, themovement is repeated, inhaling as the knees bend and the hands go down to thetops of the kneecaps, and exhaling as they are pulled back. 20. Stirring Up Personal History by Making It FlexibleThis magical pass stretches the hamstring and relaxes it by bringing each leg,one at a time, bent at the knee, to strike the buttocks with a gentle tap of theheel (fig. 162).img164.png [images/img164.png] The left heel strikes the leftbuttock, and the right heel strikes the right one.Shamans put an enormous emphasis on tightening the muscles of the backs of thethighs. They believe that the fighter those muscles, the greater the facility ofthe practitioner to identify and get rid of behavioral patterns that areuseless. 21. Stirring Up Personal History with the Heel to the Ground by Tapping ItRepeatedlyThe right leg is set at a ninety-degree angle with the left. The left foot isplaced as far as possible in front of the body as the body almost sits on theright leg. The tension and contraction of the back muscles of the right leg aremaximum, as is the stretching of the back muscles of the left leg. The left legtaps the ground repeatedly with the heel (fig. 163).img165.png[images/img165.png] The same movements are then executed with the other leg. 22. Stirring Up Personal History with the Heel to the Ground by Sustaining ThatPositionThe same movements are executed in this magical pass as in the previous one,again with each leg, but instead of tapping with the heel, the body is kept atan even tension by holding the stretch of the leg (fig. 164).img166.png[images/img166.png] The following four magical passes, since they entail deepinhalations and exhalations, have to be done sparingly. 23. The Recapitulation WingsA deep inhalation is taken as both forearms are raised to the level of theshoulders, with the hands at the level of the ears, palms facing forward. Theforearms are held vertically and equidistant from Figure 164 each other. Anexhalation follows as the forearms are pulled back as far as possible withoutslanting them in any direction (fig. 165).img167.png [images/img167.png] Anotherdeep inhalation is taken. Within the duration of one long exhalation, both armseach draw a winglike semicircle, beginning with the left arm moving forward asfar as it can be extended and then laterally, drawing a semicircle to the backas far as possible. The arm makes a curve at the end of this extension andreturns to the front (fig. 166)img168.png [images/img168.png] to its initialresting position by the side of the body (fig. 167).img169.png[images/img169.png] Then the right arm follows the same pattern within the sameexhalation. Once these movements are completed, a deep abdominal breath istaken. 24. The Window of RecapitulationThe first part of this magical pass is exactly like the preceding one; a deepbreath is taken with the hands raised to the ear level, with the palms facingforward. The forearms maintain a perfect verticality. This is followed by a longexhalation as the arms are pulled backwards. A deep inhalation is taken as theelbows are extended laterally at the level of the shoulders. The hands are bentat a ninety-degree angle in relation to the forearms, the fingers pointingupward. The hands are slowly pushed toward the center of the body until theforearms cross. The left arm is held closer to the body and the right arm isplaced in front of the left. The hands create in this fashion what don Juancalled the window of recapitulation: an opening in front of the eyes that lookslike a small window, through which, don Juan affirmed, a practitioner could peerinto infinity (fig. 168).img170.png [images/img170.png] A deep exhalationfollows as the body straightens; the elbows are extended laterally and the handsare straightened out and kept at the same level as the elbows (fig.169).img171.png [images/img171.png] 25. The Five Deep BreathsThe beginning of this magical pass is exactly like the previous two. At thesecond inhalation, the arms go down and cross at the level of the knees as thepractitioner adopts a semi-squatting position. The hands are placed behind theknees; the right hand grabs the tendons in back of the left knee, and the lefthand, with the left forearm on top of the right, grabs the tendons in back ofthe right knee. The index and middle fingers grab the outer tendons there andthe thumb is wrapped around the inner part of the knee. The exhalation endsthen, and a deep inhalation is taken, accompanied by pressing the tendon (fig.170).img172.png [images/img172.png] Five breaths are taken in this fashion.This magical pass causes the back to be straight and the head to be in alignmentwith the spine, and is used to take deep breaths that fill the top as well asthe lower part of the lungs by pushing the diaphragm downward. 26. Drawing Energy from the FeetThe first part of this magical pass is exactly the same as the beginning of theother three of this series. On the second inhalation, the forearms go down andwrap around the ankles, going from the inside to the outside as the practitioneradopts a squatting position. The backs of the hands rest on top of the toes, andin this fashion, three deep inhalations and three deep exhalations are made(fig. 171).img173.png [images/img173.png] After the last exhalation, the bodystraightens as a deep inhalation is taken to finish the magical pass.The only glow of awareness left in human beings is at the bottom of Theirluminous spheres, a fringe that extends in a circle and reaches the level of thetoes. With this magical pass, that fringe is tapped with the Kicks of thefingers, and stirred with the breath.================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: Third Group: DreamingDon Juan Matus defined dreaming as the act of using normal dreams as a bona fideentrance for human awareness into other realms of perceiving; This definitionimplied for him that ordinary dreams could be used as a hatch that ledperception into other regions of energy different from the energy of the worldof everyday life, and yet utterly similar to it at a basic core. The result ofsuch an entrance was, for sorcerers, the perception of veritable worlds wherethey could live or die, worlds which were astoundingly different from ours, andyet utterly similar.Pressed for a linear explanation of this contradiction, don Juan Matusreiterated the standard position of sorcerers: that the answers to all thosequestions were in the practice, not in the intellectual inquiry. He said that inorder to talk about such possibilities, we would have to use the syntax oflanguage, whatever language we spoke, and that syntax, by the force of usage,limits the possibilities of expression. The syntax of any language refers onlyto perceptual possibilities found in the world in which we live.Don Juan made a significant differentiation, in Spanish, between two verbs: onewas to dream, sonar; and the other was ensueno, which is to dream the waysorcerers dream. In English, there is no clear distinction between these twostates: the normal dreaming, sueno, and the more complex state that sorcererscall ensueno.The art of dreaming, according to what don Juan taught, originated in a verycasual observation that the shamans of ancient Mexico made when they saw peoplewho were asleep. They noticed that during sleep the assemblage point wasdisplaced in a very natural, easy way from its habitual position, and that itmoved anywhere along the periphery of the luminous sphere, or to any place inthe interior of it. Correlating their seeing with the reports of the people whohad been observed sleeping, they realized that the greater the observeddisplacement of the assemblage point, the more astounding the reports of eventsand scenes experienced in dreams.After this observation took hold of them, those sorcerers began to look avidlyfor opportunities to displace their own assemblage points. They ended up usingpsychotropic plants to accomplish this. Very quickly, they realized that thedisplacement brought about by using these plants was erratic, forced, and out ofcontrol. In the midst of this failure, nonetheless they discovered one thing ofgreat value. They called it dreaming attention.Don Juan explained this phenomenon, referring first to the daily awareness ofhuman beings as the attention placed on the elements of the world of everydaylife. He pointed out that human beings took only a cursory and yet sustainedlook at everything that surrounded them.More than examining things, human beings simply established the presence ofthose elements by a special type of attention, a specific aspect of theirgeneral awareness. His contention was that the same type of cursory and yetsustained \"look,\" so to speak, could be applied to the elements of an ordinarydream. He called this other, specific aspect of general awareness dreamingattention or the capacity that practitioners acquire to maintain their awarenessunwaveringly fixed on the items of their dreams.The cultivation of dreaming attention gave the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage abasic taxonomy of dreams. They found out that most of their dreams were imagery,products of the cognition of their daily world; however, there were some whichescaped that classification. Such dreams were veritable states of heightenedawareness in which the elements of the dream were not mere imagery, butenergy-generating affairs. Dreams which had energy-generating elements were, forthose shamans, dreams in which they were capable of seeing energy as it (lowedin the universe.Those shamans were able to focus their dreaming attention on any element oftheir dreams, and found out, in this fashion, that there are two kinds ofdreams. One is the dreams that we are all familiar with, in whichphantasmagorical elements come into play, something which we could categorize asthe product of our mentality, our psyche; perhaps something that has to do withour neurological makeup. The other kind of dreams they called energy-generatingdreams. Don Juan said that those sorcerers of ancient times found themselves indreams which were not dreams, but actual visitations made in a dreamlike stateto bona fide places other than this world - real places, just like the world inwhich we live; places where the objects of the dream generated energy, just aslives, or animals, or even rocks generate energy in our daily world, for aseeing sorcerer.Their visions of such places were, however, for those shamans, too fleeting, tootemporary, to be of any value to them. They attributed this flaw to the factthat their assemblage points could not be held fixed for any considerable timeat the position to which they had been displaced. Their attempts to remedy thesituation resulted in the other high art of sorcery: the art of stalking.Don Juan defined the two arts very clearly one day when he said to me that theart of dreaming consisted of purposely displacing the assemblage point from itshabitual position. The art of stalking consisted in volitionally making it stayfixed on the new position to which it had been displaced.This fixation allowed the shamans of ancient Mexico the opportunity to witnessother worlds in their full extent. Don Juan said that some of those sorcerersnever returned from their journeys. In other words, they opted for stayingthere, wherever \"there\" might have been.\"When the old sorcerers finished mapping human beings as luminous spheres,\" donJuan said to me once, \"they had discovered no less than six hundred spots in thetotal luminous sphere that were the sites of bona fide worlds. Meaning that, ifthe assemblage point became attached to any of those places, the result was theentrance of the practitioner into a total new world.\"\"But where are those six hundred other worlds, don Juan?\" I asked.\"The only answer to that question is incomprehensible,\" he said, laughing. \"It'sthe essence of sorcery, and yet it means nothing to the average mind. Those sixhundred worlds are in the position of the assemblage point. Incalculable amountsof energy are required to make sense out of this answer. We have the energy.What we lack is the facility or disposition to use it.\"I could add that nothing could be truer than all these statements, and yet,nothing could make less sense.Don Juan explained usual perception in the terms in which the sorcerers of hislineage understood it: The assemblage point, at its habitual location, receivesan inflow of energy fields from the universe at large in the form of luminousfilaments, numbering in the trillions. Since its position is consistently thesame, it stood to sorcerers' reasoning that the same energy fields, in the formof luminous filaments, converge on the assemblage point and go through it,giving as a consistent result the perception of the world that we know. Thosesorcerers arrived at the unavoidable conclusion that if the assemblage pointwere displaced to another position, another set of energy filaments would gothrough it, resulting in the perception of a world that, by definition, was notthe same as the world of everyday life.In don Juan's opinion, what human beings ordinarily regard as perceiving israther the act of interpreting sensory data. He maintained that from the momentof birth, everything around us supplies us with a possibility of interpretation,and that with time, this possibility turns into a full system by means of whichwe conduct all of our perceptual transactions in the world.He pointed out that the assemblage point is not only the center where perceptionis assembled, but also the center where the interpretation of sensory data isaccomplished, so that if it were to change locations, it would interpret the newinflux of energy fields in very much the same terms in which it interprets theworld of everyday life. The result of this new interpretation is the perceptionof a world which is strangely similar to ours, and yet intrinsically different.Don Juan said that energetically, those other worlds are as different from oursas they could possibly be. It is only the interpretation of the assemblage pointwhich accounts for the seeming similarities.Don Juan called for a new syntax that could be used in order to express thiswondrous quality of the assemblage point and the possibilities of perceptionbrought about by dreaming. He conceded, however, that perhaps the present syntaxof our language could be forced to cover it if this experience became availableto any one of us, and not merely to shaman initiates.Something related to dreaming that was of tremendous interest to me, hut whichbewildered me to no end, was don Juan's statement that there was really noprocedure to speak of that would teach anyone how to dream. He said that morethan anything else, dreaming was an arduous effort on the part of thepractitioners to put themselves in contact with the indescribable all-pervadingforce that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico called intent. Once this link wasestablished, dreaming also mysteriously became established. Don Juan assertedthat this linkage could be accomplished following any pattern that implieddiscipline.When I asked him to give me a succinct explanation of the procedures involved,he laughed at me.\"To venture into the world of sorcerers,\" he said, \"is not like learning todrive a car. To drive a car, you need manuals and instructions. To dream, youneed to intend it.\"\"But how can I intend it?\" I insisted.\"The only way you could intend it is by intending it,\" he declared. \"One of themost difficult things for a man of our day to accept is a lack of procedure.Modern man is in the throes of manuals, praxes, methods, steps loading to. He isceaselessly taking notes, making diagrams, deeply involved in the 'know-how.'But in the world of sorcerers, procedures and rituals are mere designs toattract and focus attention. They are devices used to force a focusing ofinterest and determination. They have no other value.\"What don Juan considered to be of supreme importance in order to dream is therigorous execution of the magical passes: the only device that the sorcerers ofhis lineage used to aid the displacement of the assemblage point. The executionof the magical passes gave those sorcerers the stability and the energynecessary to call forth their dreaming attention, without which there was nopossibility of dreaming for them. Without the emergence of dreaming attention,practitioners could aspire, at best, to have lucid dreams about phantasmagoricalworlds. They could perhaps have views of worlds that generate energy, but thesewould make no sense to them whatsoever in the absence of an all-inclusiverationale that would properly categorize them.Once the shamans of don Juan's lineage had developed their dreaming attention,they realized that they had tapped on the doors of infinity. They had succeededin enlarging the parameters of their normal perception. They discovered thattheir normal state of awareness was infinitely more varied than it had beenbefore the advent of their dreaming attention. From that point on, thosesorcerers could truthfully venture into the unknown.\"The aphorism,\" don Juan said to me once, \"that 'the sky is the limit' was mostapplicable to the sorcerers of ancient times. They certainly outdid themselves.\"\"Was it really true for them that the sky was the limit, don Juan?\" I asked.\"This question could be answered only by each of us individually,\" he said,smiling expansively. \"They gave us the tools. It is up to us individually to usethem or refuse them. In essence, we are alone in front of infinity, and theissue of whether or not we are capable of reaching our limits has to be answeredpersonally.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: Third Group: The Magical Passes for Dreaming27. Getting the Assemblage Point LooseThe left arm, with the palm of the hand turned upward, reaches over the areabehind the shoulder blades, as the trunk leans a bit forward. Then the arm isbrought in an underhanded motion from the left side of the body to the front,moving in an upward thrust in front of the face, with the palm of the left handturned to face the left. The fingers are held together (figs. 172,173).img174.png [images/img174.png] img175.png [images/img175.png]This magicalpass is executed by each arm in succession. The knees are kept bent for greaterstability and thrusting force. 28. Forcing the Assemblage Point to Drop DownThe back is kept as straight as possible. The knees are locked. The left arm,fully stretched, is placed at the hack, a few inches away from the body. Thehand is bent at a ninety-degree angle in relation to the forearm; the palm facesdownward and the fully stretched fingers point backward. The fully stretchedright arm is placed in front in the same position: with the wrist bent at aninety-degree angle, the palm facing downward, the fingers pointing forward.The head turns in the direction of the arm that is kept at the back, and a totalstretch of the tendons ()l the legs and arms takes place at that instant. Thistension of the tendons is held for a moment (fig. 174).img176.png[images/img176.png] The same movement is repeated with the right arm in hack andthe left in front. 29. Enticing the Assemblage Point to Drop by Drawing Energy from the Adrenalsand Transferring It to the FrontThe left arm is placed behind the body at the level of the kidneys, as far tothe right as it can reach; the hand is held like a claw. The clawed hand movesacross the kidney area from right to left as if dragging a solid substance. Theright arm is held in its normal position by the side of the thigh.Next, the left hand moves to the front; the palm is held flat, on the rightside, against the liver and gallbladder. The left hand moves across the front ofthe body to the left, the area of the pancreas and spleen, as if smoothing thesurface of a solid substance; at the same time the right hand, held like a clawbehind the body, moves from left to right over the kidneys as if dragging asolid substance.Then the right hand is placed on the front of the body; the palm is held flatagainst the area of the pancreas and spleen. The hand moves across the front ofthe body to the area of the liver and gallbladder, as if smoothing a roughsurface, while the clawed left hand moves again across the area of the kidneysfrom right to left as if dragging a solid substance (figs. 175, 176).img177.png[images/img177.png] img178.png [images/img178.png]The knees are kept bent forgreater stability and force. 30. Playing Out the A and B Types of EnergyThe right forearm, bent in a vertical position, at a ninety-degree angle, iscentered in front of the body, with the elbow almost at the level of theshoulders, and the palm of the hand facing left. The left forearm, bent at theelbow and held in a horizontal position, is placed with the back of the handunderneath the right elbow. The eyes, without focusing on either forearm, keep aperipheral view of both of them. The pressure of the right arm is downward,while the pressure of the left arm is upward. The two forces act simultaneouslyon both arms; they are kept under this tension for a moment (fig.177).img179.png [images/img179.png]Then the same movement is executed by reversing the order and position of thearms.The shamans of ancient Mexico believed that everything in the universe iscomposed of dual forces, and that human beings are subjected to that duality inevery aspect of their lives. At the level of energy, they considered that twoforces are at play. Don Juan called them the A and B forces. The A force isemployed ordinarily in our daily affairs, and is represented by a straightvertical line. The B force is ordinarily an obscure one which rarely enters intoaction, and it is kept lying down. It is represented by a horizontal line drawnto the left of the vertical one, at its base, making in this fashion a reversedcapital letter L.Shamans, men and women, were the only ones who, in don Juan's view, had beencapable of turning the force B, which is ordinarily lying down horizontally, outof use, into an active vertical line. And consequently, they had succeeded inputting force A to rest. This process was represented by drawing a horizontalline at the base of the vertical one, in its right, and making, as a result, acapital letter L. Don Juan portrayed this magical pass as the one which bestexemplified this duality and the effort of the sorcerers to reverse its effects. 31. Pulling the Energy Body to the FrontThe arms are kept at shoulder level with the elbows bent. The hands overlap eachother, and they are turned with the palms down. A circle is made with the handsrotating around each other; the movement is inward, toward the face (fig.178).img180.png [images/img180.png] They rotate three times around each other;then the left arm is thrust forward with the hand in a fist, as if to strike aninvisible target in front of the body, an arm's length away from it (fig.179).img181.png [images/img181.png] Three more circles are drawn with bothhands, and then the right arm strikes in the same fashion as the left one. 32. Hurling the Assemblage Point Like a Knife over the ShoulderThe left hand reaches over the head to the area behind the shoulder blades andgrabs, as if holding a solid object. Then it moves over the head to the front ofthe body, with the motion of hurling something forward. The knees are kept bentfor hurling stability. The same movement is repeated with the right arm (figs.180, 181).img182.png [images/img182.png] img183.png [images/img183.png]This magical pass is an actual attempt to hurl the assemblage point, in order todisplace it from its habitual position. The practitioner holds the assemblagepoint as if it were a knife. Something in the intent of hurling the assemblagepoint causes a profound effect toward the actual displacement of it. 33. Hurling the Assemblage Point Like a Knife from the Back by the WaistThe knees are kept bent as the body leans forward. Then the left arm reaches tothe back, from the side, to the area behind the shoulder blades, grabs ontosomething as if it were solid, and hurls it forward from the waist, with a flickof the wrist, as if hurling a flat disk, or a knife (figs. 182, 183).img184.png[images/img184.png]img185.png [images/img185.png] The same movements arerepeated with the right hand. 34. Hurling the Assemblage Point Like a Disk from the ShoulderA deep rotation of the waist is made to the left, which propels the right arm toswing to the left side of the left leg. Then the motion of the waist, moving inthe opposite direction, propels the left arm to swing to the right side of theright leg. Another motion of the waist propels the right arm to swing again tothe left side of the left leg. At this point the left hand reaches backinstantly with a circular motion to grab onto something as if it were solid,from the area behind the shoulder blades (fig. 184).img186.png[images/img186.png]The left hand takes it in a swinging circular motion to the front of the bodyand up to the level of the right shoulder. The palm of the clenched hand facesupward. From this position, the left hand, with a flick of the wrist, makes ahurling motion, as if to hurl forward something solid, like a disk (fig.185).img187.png [images/img187.png]The legs are kept bent slightly at the knees and a great pressure is exerted atthe back of the thighs. The right arm, with the elbow slightly bent, is extendedbehind the body to give stability to the act of hurling a disk. This position isheld for a moment, while the left arm maintains the position of having justhurled an object. The same movements are repeated with the other arm. 35. Hurling the Assemblage Point Like a Ball Above the HeadThe left hand moves back quickly to the area behind the shoulder blades andgrabs something, as if it were solid (fig. 186).img188.png [images/img188.png]The arm rotates twice in a big circle above the head as if to gain impulse (fig.187)img189.png [images/img189.png] and makes the motion of hurling a ballforward (fig. 188).img190.png [images/img190.png] The knees are kept bent. Thesemovements are repeated with the right hand. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: Fourth Group: Inner SilenceDon Juan said that inner silence was the state most avidly sought by the shamansof ancient Mexico. He defined it as a natural state of human perception in whichthoughts are blocked off and all of man's faculties operate from a level ofawareness which doesn't require the utilization of our daily cognitive system.Inner silence has always been associated with darkness, for the shamans of donJuan's lineage, perhaps because human perception, deprived of its habitualcompanion, the internal dialogue, falls into something that resembles a darkpit. He said that the body functions as usual, hut awareness becomes sharper.Decisions are instantaneous, and seem to stem from a special sort of knowledgewhich is deprived of thought verbalizations.Human perception functioning in a condition of inner silence, according to donJuan, is capable of reaching indescribable levels. Some of those levels ofperception are worlds in themselves, and not at all like the worlds reachedthrough dreaming. They are indescribable states, inexplicable in terms of thelinear paradigms that the habitual state of human perception employs forexplaining the universe.Inner silence, in don Juan's understanding, is the matrix for a gigantic step ofevolution: silent knowledge, or the level of human awareness where knowing isautomatic and instantaneous. Knowledge at this level is not the product ofcerebral cogitation or logical induction and deduction, or of generalizationsbased on similarities and dissimilarities. There is nothing a priori at thelevel of silent knowledge, nothing that could constitute a body of knowledge,for everything is imminently now. Complex pieces of information could be graspedwithout any cognitive preliminaries.Don Juan believed that silent knowledge was insinuated to early man, but thatearly man was not really the possessor of silent knowledge. Such an insinuationwas infinitely stronger than what modern man experiences, where the bulk ofknowledge is the product of rote learning. It is a sorcerers' axiom thatalthough we have lost that insinuation, the avenue that leads to silentknowledge will always be open to man by means of inner silence.Don Juan Matus taught the hard line of his lineage: that inner silence must begained by a consistent pressure of discipline. It has to be accrued or stored,bit by bit, second by second. In other words, one has to force oneself to besilent, even if it is only for a few seconds. According to don Juan, it wascommon knowledge among sorcerers that if one persists in this, persistenceovercomes habit, and thus, it is possible to arrive at a threshold of accruedseconds or minutes, which differs from person to person. If the threshold ofinner silence is ten minutes for a given individual, for instance, then oncethis threshold is reached, inner silence happens by itself, of its own accord,so to speak.I was warned beforehand that there was no possible way of knowing what myindividual threshold might be, and that the only way of finding this out wasthrough direct experience. This is exactly what happened to me. Following donJuan's suggestion, I had persisted in forcing myself to remain silent, and oneday, while walking at .UCLA, I reached my mysterious threshold. I knew I hadreached it because in one instant, I experienced something don Juan haddescribed at length to me. He had called it stopping the world. In the blink ofan eye, the world ceased to be what it was, and for the first time in my life, Ibecame conscious that I was seeing energy as it flowed in the universe. I had tosit down on some brick steps. I knew that I was sitting on some brick steps, but1 knew it only intellectually, through memory. Exponentially, 1 was resting onenergy. I myself was energy, and so was everything around me. I had canceled outmy interpretation system.After seeing energy directly, I realized something which became the horror of myday, something that no one could explain to me satisfactorily except don Juan. Ibecame conscious that although I was seeing for the first time in my life, I hadbeen seeing energy as it flows in the universe all my life, but I had not beenconscious of it. To see energy as it flows in the universe was not the novelty.The novelty was the query that arose with such fury that it made me surface backinto the world of everyday life. I asked myself what had been keeping me fromrealizing that I had been seeing energy as it flows in the universe all my life.\"There are two issues at stake here,\" don Juan explained to me, when I asked himabout this maddening contradiction. \"One is general awareness. The other isparticular, deliberate consciousness. Every human being in the world is aware,in general terms, of seeing energy as it flows in the universe. However, onlysorcerers are particularly and deliberately conscious of it. To become consciousof something that you are generally aware of requires energy, and the iron-handdiscipline needed to get it. Your inner silence, the product of discipline andenergy, bridged the gap between general awareness and particular consciousness.\"Don Juan stressed, in every way he was able, the value of a pragmatic attitudein order to buttress the advent of inner silence. He defined a pragmaticattitude as the capacity to absorb any contingency that might appear along Theway. He himself was, to me, the living example of such an attitude. There w;isn't any uncertainty or liability that his mere presence would not dispel.He reiterated every time he could that the effects of inner silence were veryunsettling, and that the only deterrent to this condition was the pragmaticattitude which was the product of a superbly pliable, agile, strong body. Hesaid that for sorcerers, the physical body was the only entity that made anysense to them, and that there was no such thing as a dualism between body andmind. He further stated that the physical body involved both the body and themind as we knew them, and that in order to counterbalance the physical body as aholistic unit, sorcerers considered another configuration of energy which wasreached through inner silence: the energy body. He explained that what I hadexperienced .it the moment in which I had stopped the world was the resurgenceof my energy body, and that this configuration of energy was the one which hadalways been able to see energy as it flowed in the universe. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Third Series: Fourth Group: The Magical Passes that Aid the Attainment ofInner Silence36. Drawing Two Half-Circles with Each FootThe total weight of the body is on the right leg. The left foot is placed half astep in front of it, and it slides on the floor, drawing a half-circle to theleft; the ball of the foot comes to rest almost touching the right heel. Fromthere, it draws another half-circle to the back (fig. 189).img191.png[images/img191.png] These circles are drawn with the ball of the left foot. Theheel is kept off the ground, in order to make the movement smooth and uniform.The movement is reversed and two more half-circles are drawn in this fashion,starting from the back and going to the front. The same movements are executedwith the right foot after the whole weight of the body is transferred to theleft leg. The knee of the leg that supports the weight is bent for strength andstability. 37. Drawing a Half-Moon with Each FootThe weight of the body is placed on the right leg. The left foot goes half astep in front of the right one, drawing a wide semicircle on the ground aroundthe body from the front, to the left, to the back of the body. This semicircleis drawn with the ball of the foot (fig. 190).img192.png [images/img192.png]Another semicircle is drawn from the back to the front, in the same fashion. Thesame movements are executed with the right leg, after transferring the weight tothe left leg. 38. The Scarecrow in the Wind with the Arms DownThe arms are kept extended laterally at the level of the shoulders with theelbows bent and the forearms dangling downward at a strict ninety-degree angle.The forearms swing freely from side to side, as if moved by the wind alone. Theforearms and the wrists are kept straight and vertical. The knees are locked(fig. 191).img193.png [images/img193.png] 39. The Scarecrow in the Wind with the Arms UpJust as in the preceding magical pass, the arms are extended laterally at thelevel of the shoulders, except the forearms are turned upward, bent at aninety-degree angle. The forearms and wrists are kept straight and vertical(fig. 192).img194.png [images/img194.png] Then they swing freely downward to thefront (fig. 193)img195.png [images/img195.png] and upward again. The knees arelocked. 40. Pushing Energy Backward with the Full ArmThe elbows are acutely bent and the forearms held fight against the sides of thebody, as high as possible, with the hands held in fists (fig.194).img196.png[images/img196.png] As an exhalation is made, the forearms are fully extendeddownward and backward as high as possible. The knees are locked, and the trunkbends slightly forward (fig. 195).img197.png [images/img197.png] As aninhalation is made, the arms are then brought forward to the original positionby bending the elbows. Then the breathing is reversed as this movement isrepeated; instead of exhaling as the arms are pulled backwards, an inhalation istaken. An exhalation follows as the elbows are bent and the forearms are broughtupward against the axilla. 41. Pivoting the ForearmThe arms are held in front of the body with the elbows bent and the forearmsvertical. Each hand is bent at the wrist, resembling the head of a bird, whichis at eye level, with the fingers pointing toward the face (fig. 196).img198.png[images/img198.png] Keeping the elbows vertical and straight, the wrists areflipped back and forth, pivoting on the forearms, making the fingers of thehands move from pointing at the face to pointing forward (fig. 197).img199.png[images/img199.png] The knees are kept bent for stability and strength. 42. Moving Energy in a RippleThe knees are kept straight, and the trunk stoops over. Both arms are keptdangling at the sides. The left arm moves forward with three ripples of thehand, as if the hand were following the contour of a surface with threehalf-circles on it (fig. 198).img200.png [images/img200.png] Next, the hand cutsacross the front of the body in a straight line from left to right, then fromright to left (fig. 199),img201.png [images/img201.png] and moves backward atthe side of the body with three more ripples, drawing in this fashion the thickshape of an inverted capital letter L - at least six inches thick. The samemovements are repeated with the right arm. 43. The T Energy of the HandsThe two forearms are held at right angles right in front of the solar plexus,making the shape of a letter T. The left hand is the horizontal bar of theletter T with the palm turned upward. The right hand is the vertical bar of theletter T with the palm turned downward (fig. 200).img202.png [images/img202.png]Next, the hands turn back and forth at the same time with considerable force.The palm of the left hand is turned to face downward, and the palm of the righthand is turned to face upward, both hands maintaining the same letter T shape(fig. 201).img203.png [images/img203.png]These same movements are executed again, placing the right hand as thehorizontal bar of the letter T and the left hand as the vertical one. 44. Pressing Energy with the ThumbsThe forearms, bent at the elbows, are held right in front of the body in aperfectly horizontal position, maintaining the width of the body. The fingersare curled in a loose fist, and the thumbs are held straight, cradled on thecurled index fingers (figs. 202, 203).img204.png [images/img204.png]img205.png[images/img205.png] An intermittent pressure is exerted between the thumb andthe index finger and the curled fingers against the palm of the hand. Theycontract and relax, spreading the impulse to the arms. The knees are kept bentfor stability. 45. Drawing an Acute Angle with the Arms Between the LegsThe knees are locked, with the hamstrings as fight as possible. The trunk isbent forward, with the head almost at the level of the knees. The arms dangle infront and, moving repeatedly forward and backward, they draw an acute angle withits vertex between the legs (figs. 204, 205).img206.png [images/img206.png]img207.png [images/img207.png] 46. Drawing an Acute Angle with the Arms in Front of the FaceThe knees are locked, with the hamstrings as fight as possible. The trunk isbent forward, with the head almost at the level of the knees. The arms dangle infront of the body and, moving repeatedly from the Kick to the front, they drawan acute angle, with its vertex in front of the face (figs. 206, 207).img208.png[images/img208.png]img209.png [images/img209.png] 47. Drawing a Circle of Energy Between the Legs and in Front of the BodyThe knees are kept locked, with the hamstrings as fight as possible. The trunkis bent forward, with the head almost at the level of the knees. The arms danglein front of the body. The two arms cross at the wrists, the left forearm on topof the right one. The crossed arms swing back between the legs (fig.208).img210.png [images/img210.png] From there, each one makes an outward circlein front of the face. At the end of the circle, the arms point forward, the leftwrist on top of the right one (fig. 209).img211.png [images/img211.png] Fromthere, they draw two inward circles that end between the legs, with the wristscrossed once more in the initial position.Then the right wrist is made to rest on top of the left one, and the samemovements are repeated. 48. Three Fingers on the FloorThe arms are brought slowly over the head as a deep inhalation is taken. A slowexhalation begins while the arms are brought all the way down to the floor,keeping the knees locked and the hamstrings as fight as possible. The index andmiddle fingers of each hand touch the floor a foot in front of the body, andthen the thumb is also brought to rest on , the floor (fig. 210).img212.png[images/img212.png] A deep inhalation is taken while that position is held. Thebody straightens, and the arms are raised above the head. The air is exhaled asthe arms come down to the level of the waist. 49. The Knuckles on the ToesThe arms are raised above the head as a deep inhalation is taken. As the air isexhaled, the arms are brought all the way down to the floor, keeping the kneeslocked and the hamstrings as fight as possible. The knuckles are brought to reston top of the toes as the exhalation ends (fig. 211).img213.png[images/img213.png] A deep inhalation is taken while that position is held. Thebody straightens, and the arms are raised above the head. The exhalation beginswhen the arms are brought down to the level of the waist. 50. Drawing Energy from the Floor with the BreathA deep inhalation is taken as the arms are raised above the head; the knees arekept bent. The exhalation begins as the trunk turns to the left and bends downas far as possible. The hands, with the palms down, come to rest around the leftfoot, with the right hand in front of the foot and the left hand behind it; theymove back and forth five rimes as the exhalation ends (fig. 212).img214.png[images/img214.png] A deep inhalation is taken then, and the body straightens asthe arms move over the head. The trunk turns to the right, and the exhalationbegins as the trunk bends down as far as possible. The exhalation ends after thehands move back and forth five times by the right foot. Another deep breath istaken, and the body straightens up as the arms move above the head and the trunkpivots to face the front; then the arms come down as the air is exhaled. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fourth Series: The Separation of the Left Body and the Right Body: The HeatSeriesDon Juan taught his disciples that for the shamans who lived in Mexico inancient times, the concept that a human being is composed of two completefunctioning bodies, one on the left and one on the right, was fundamental totheir endeavors as sorcerers. Such a classificatory scheme had nothing to dowith intellectual speculations on the part of those sorcerers, or with logicalconclusions about possibilities of distribution of mass in the body.When don Juan explained this to me, I countered that modern biologists had theconcept of bilateral symmetry, which means \"a basic body plan in which the leftand right sides of the organism can be divided into approximate mirror images ofeach other along the midline.\"\"The classifications of the shamans of ancient Mexico,\" don Juan replied, \"weremore profound than the conclusions of modern scientists, because they stemmedfrom perceiving energy directly as it flows in the universe. When the human bodyis perceived as energy, it is utterly patent that it is composed not of twoparts, but of two different types of energy: two different currents of energy,two opposing and at the same nine complementary forces that coexist side byside, mirroring, in this fashion, the dual structure of everything in theuniverse at large.\"The shamans of ancient Mexico accorded each-one of these two different kinds ofenergy the stature of a total body, and spoke exclusively in terms of the leftbody and the right body. Their emphasis was on the left body, because theyconsidered it to be the most effective, in terms of the nature of its energyconfiguration, for the ultimate goals of shamanism. The shamans of ancientMexico, who depicted the two bodies as streams of energy, depicted the leftstream as being more turbulent and aggressive, moving in undulating ripples andprojecting out waves of energy. When illustrating what he was talking about, donJuan asked me to visualize a scene in which the left body was like half of thesun, and that all the solar flares happened on that half. The waves of energyprojected out of the left body were like those solar flares - alwaysperpendicular to the round surface from which they originated.He depicted the stream of energy of the right body as not being turbulent at allon the surface. It moved like water inside a tank which was being slightlytilted back and forth. There were no ripples in it, but a continuous rockingmotion. At a deeper level, however, it swirled in rotational circles in the formof spirals. Don Juan asked me to envision a very wide, peaceful-looking tropicalriver, where the water on the surface seemed barely to move, but which hadshattering riptides below the surface. In the world of everyday life, these twocurrents are amalgamated into a single unit: the human body as we know it.To the eye of the seer, however, the energy of the total body is circular. Thismeant to the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage that the right body was thepredominant force.\"What happens in the case of left-handed people?\" I asked him once. \"Are theymore suitable for the endeavors of sorcerers?\"\"Why do you think they should be?\" he replied, seemingly surprised by myquestion.\"Because obviously, the left side is predominant,\" I said.\"This predominance is of no importance whatsoever for sorcerers,\" he said. \"Yes,the left side predominates in the sense that they can hold a hammer with theirleft hand very effectively. They write with their left hand. They can hold aknife with their left hand, and do it very well. If they are leg shakers, theycan certainly shake the left knee with great rhythm. In other words, they haverhythm in their left body, but sorcery is not a matter of that kind ofpredominance. The right body still rules them with a circular motion.\"\"But does left-handedness have any advantages or disadvantages for sorcerers?\" Iasked. I was driven by the implication built into many of the Indo-Europeanlanguages of the sinister quality of left-handedness.\"There are no advantages or disadvantages to my knowledge,\" he said. \"Thedivision of energy between the two bodies is not measured by dexterity, or thelack of it. The predominance of the right body is an energetic predominance,which was encountered by the shamans of those ancient times. They never tried toexplain why this predominance happened in the first place, nor did they try tofurther investigate the philosophical implications of it. For them, it was afact, but a very special fact. It was a fact that could be changed.\"\"Why did they want to change it, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Because the predominant circular motion of the right body's energy , is toofriggin' boring!\" he exclaimed. \"That circular motion certainly takes care ofany event of the daily world, but it does it circularly, if you know what Imean.\"\"I don't know what you mean, don Juan,\" I said.\"Every situation in life is met in this circular fashion,\" he replied, making asmall circle with his hand. \"On and on and on and on and on. It's a circularmovement that seems to draw the energy inward always, and turns it around andaround in a centripetal motion. Under these conditions, there's no expansion.Nothing can be new. There is nothing that cannot be inwardly accounted for. Whata drag!\"\"In what way can this situation be changed, don Juan?\" I asked.\"It's too late to be really changed,\" he replied. \"The damage is already done.The spiral quality is here to remain. But it doesn't have to be ceaseless. Yes,we walk the way we do, we can't change that, but we would also like to run, orto walk backward, or to climb a ladder; just to walk and walk and walk and walkis very effective, but meaningless. The contribution of the left body would makethose centers of vitality more pliable. If they could undulate instead of movingin spirals, if only for an instant, different energy would get into them, withstaggering results.\"I understood what he was talking about, at a level beyond thought, because therewas really no way that I could have understood it linearly.\"The sensation that human beings have of being utterly bored with themselves,\"he continued, \"is due to this predominance of the right body. The only thingleft for human beings to do, in a universal sense, is 10 find ways of riddingthemselves of boredom. What they end up doing is finding ways of killing time:the only commodity no one has enough of. But what's worse is the reaction tothis unbalanced distribution of energy. The violent reactions of people are dueto this unbalanced distribution. It seems that from time to rime, helplessnessbuilds furious currents of energy within the human body, which explode inviolent behavior. Violence seems to be, for human beings, another way of killingtime.\"\"But why is it, don Juan, that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico never wanted toknow why this situation happened?\" I asked, bewildered. I found what I wasfeeling about this inward motion to be fascinating.\"They never tried to find out,\" he said, \"because the instant they formulatedthe question, they knew the answer.\"\"So they knew why?\" I asked.\"No, they didn't know why, but they knew how it happened. But that's anotherstory.\"He left me hanging there, but throughout the course of my association with him,he explained this seeming contradiction.\"Awareness is the only avenue that human beings have for evolution,\" he said tome once, \"and something extraneous to us, something that has to do with thepredatorial condition of the universe, has interrupted our possibility ofevolving by taking possession of our awareness. Human beings have fallen prey toa predatorial force, which has imposed on them, for its own convenience, thepassivity which is characteristic of the energy of the right body.\"Don Juan described our evolutionary possibility as a journey that our awarenesstakes across something the shamans of ancient Mexico called the dark sea ofawareness: something which they considered to be an actual feature of theuniverse, an incommensurable element that permeates the universe, like clouds ofmatter, or light.Don Juan was convinced that the predominance of the right body in thisunbalanced merging of the right and left bodies marks the interruption of ourjourney of awareness. What seems for us to be the natural dominance of one sideover the other was, for the sorcerers of his lineage, an aberration, which theystrove to correct.Those shamans believed that in order to establish a harmonious division betweenthe left and the right bodies, practitioners needed to enhance their awareness.Any enhancement of human awareness, however, had to be buttressed by the mostexigent discipline. Otherwise, this enhancement, painfully accomplished, wouldturn into an obsession, resulting in anything from psychological aberration toenergetic injury.Don Juan Matus called the collection of magical passes which deal exclusivelywith the separation between the left body and the right body The Heat Group: themost crucial element in the training of the shamans of ancient Mexico. This wasa nickname given to this collection of magical passes because it makes theenergy of the right body a little more turbulent. Don Juan Matus used to jokeabout this phenomenon, saying that the movements for the left body put anenormous pressure on the right body, which has been accustomed from birth toruling without opposition. The moment it is faced with opposition, it gets hotwith anger. Don Juan urged all his disciples to practice the Heat Groupassiduously, in order to use its aggressiveness to reinforce the weak left body.In Tensegrity, this group is called The Heat Series, in order to make it morecongruous with the aims of Tensegrity, which are extremely pragmatic on the onehand and extremely abstract on the other, such as the practical utilization ofenergy for well-being coupled with the abstract idea of how that energy isobtained. In all the magical passes of this series, it is recommended to adoptthe division of left and right bodies, rather than left and right sides of thebody. The end result of this observance would be to say that during theexecution of these magical passes, the body that doesn't perform the movementsis kept immobile. However, all its muscles should be engaged, not in activity,but in awareness. This immobility of the body that is not performing themovements should be extended to include its head; that is to say, to theopposite side of the head. Such immobility of half of the face and head is moredifficult to attain, but it can be accomplished with practice.The series is divided into four groups. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fourth Series: First Group: Stirring Energy on the Left Body and the RightBodyThe first group comprises sixteen magical passes that stir the energy of theleft body and the right body, each independently from the other. Each magicalpass is performed with either the left arm or the right arm, and in some caseswith both at the same time. The arms never go, however, beyond the vertical linethat separates the two bodies. 1. Gathering Energy in a Ball from the Front of the Left and the Right Bodiesand Breaking It with the Back of the HandWith the palm of the hand slightly curved and facing the right, the left armcircles inward twice in front of the body (fig. 213).img215.png[images/img215.png] All the muscles of the arm are held tense as this circularmotion is executed. Then the back of the hand strikes forcefully to the left asif breaking the top of a ball gathered with the movement of the arm (fig.214).img216.png [images/img216.png] The hand strikes a point an arm's length away from the body above theshoulders, at a forty-five-degree angle. While this strike is being executed,all the muscles are kept tense, including the muscles of the arms, a tensionthat permits controlling the strike. The impact is felt on the areas of thepancreas and spleen and the left kidney and adrenals.The same movements are repeated on the right side, and the impact is felt on theareas of the liver and the right kidney and adrenals. 2. Gathering Energy of the Left and Right Bodies in a Circle Which Is Perforatedwith the Tips of the FingersThe left forearm is held in front of the body, at a ninety-degree angle inrelation to it. The wrist is kept straight. The palm of the hand faces to theright as the fingers point to the front. The thumb is kept locked. As in theprevious magical pass, the forearm circles twice, going from the left up to thelevel of the shoulder and turning toward tin- center of the body(fig.215).img217.png [images/img217.png] The elbow is then quickly pulled allthe way back, and the circle drawn by the forearm is perforated by the tips ofthe fingers in a forward thrust (fig. 216).img218.png [images/img218.png] Theelbow is moved all the way back once more in order to gain striking power, andthen the hand shoots forward again. The same sequence of movements is performedwith the right arm. 3. Hoisting Left and Right Energy UpwardBoth knees are slightly bent. The left knee is then raised to the level of thepancreas, fully bent, while the foot is held with the toes pointing to theground. At the same time that this movement is performed, the left forearmshoots upward until it reaches a point at a forty-five-degree angle with thebody; the elbow is kept tight against the body. Both the leg and the arm move intotal synchronicity, jolting the midsection (fig. 217).img219.png[images/img219.png] The same movements are repeated with The right leg and theright arm. The tendency of energy is to sink, and it is of great importance tospread it upward to The midsection of the body. It is the belief of shamans thatthe left body is ruled by the area of the pancreas and spleen, and the rightbody by the area of the liver and gallbladder. Shamans understand this processof hoisting energy as a maneuver to energize those two centers separately. 4. The Up-and-Down PressureThe left elbow is raised in front of the body to the level of the shoulder, bentat a ninety-degree angle with the forearm. The hand is clenched in a fist, andthe wrist is bent toward the right as acutely as possible (fig. 218).img220.png[images/img220.png] Using the elbow as a pivot by keeping it at the sameposition, the forearm is bent downward until it reaches the area right in frontof the solar plexus (fig. 219).img221.png [images/img221.png] The forearm thenreturns to the upright position. The same movement is performed with the rightarm.This magical pass is used to stir up the energy that exists in an arc between apoint just above the head and in line with the left shoulder and a point rightabove the solar plexus. 5. The Inward TurnThe first part of this magical pass is exactly like the first part of thepreceding one, but instead of bending the forearm downward, it is made to rotateinwardly, making a complete circle, pivoting on the elbow at a forty-five-degreeangle with the body. The top of the circle is at a point just above the ear andin line with the left shoulder. The wrist is also made to rotate as the circleis drawn (fig. 220).img222.png [images/img222.png]The same movement is performed with the right hand. 6. The Outward TurnThis magical pass is almost identical to the preceding one, except that insteadof turning the left forearm to the right to make a circle, it turns to the left(fig. 221).img223.png [images/img223.png] It makes what don Juan called anoutward circle, as opposed to the circle made in the previous magical pass,which he called an inward circle.The same movement is performed with the right hand.In this magical pass, the energy stirred is part of the arc of energy dealt within the two preceding magical passes. The fourth, fifth, and sixth magical passesof this group are performed together. Shamans have found out, by means of theirseeing, that human beings have enormous caches of unused energy lying aroundinside their luminous spheres. They have also found out, in this manner, thatthese magical passes stir the energy dispersed from the respective centers ofvitality - the one around the liver and the one around the pancreas - whichstays suspended for quite a while before it begins to sink down to the bottom ofthe luminous sphere. 7. A High Push with the FistsThe arms are held in front of the body at the level of the shoulders. The handsare fisted with the palms turned inward the ground. The elbows are bent. Theleft hand strikes forward with a short punch, without first retrieving the elbowto gain strength. The left hand is retrieved to its initial position; the righthand follows with another similar punch and is then retrieved to its originalposition (fig. 222).img224.png [images/img224.png] The strike of the fists comesfrom the contraction of the muscles of the arms, shoulder blades, and abdomen. 8. A Low Push with the FistsThe elbows are bent at a ninety-degree angle and kept at the level of the waist.They don't touch the body, but are kept an inch or two away from it. The handsare clenched in fists with the palms facing each other. The left forearm movesto strike in a short punch, driven by the muscles of the stomach, which contractin unison with the muscles of the arm and the shoulder blade (fig.223).img225.png [images/img225.png] After striking, the forearm is retrievedinstantly, as if the punch has generated the force to push the arm back. Theright arm moves immediately afterward in the same fashion. Just as in thepreceding pass, the elbows don't move back to gain striking strength; thestrength is derived solely from the muscular tension of the abdomen, arms, andshoulder blades. 9. A Wheel with the Fingers Contracted at the Middle JointsThe elbows are kept at the level of the waist over the areas of the pancreas andspleen, and the liver and gallbladder. The wrists are kept straight; the palmsof the hands face each other while the fingers are tightly clenched at thesecond knuckle. The thumbs are locked (fig. 224).img226.png [images/img226.png]The elbows move forward and away from the body. The left hand circles in avertical rasping motion, as if the bent knuckles were rasping a surface in frontof the body. Then the right hand does the same. The two hands move in analternate fashion in such a manner (fig. 225).img227.png [images/img227.png] Themuscles of the abdomen are kept as fight as possible in order to give impetus tothis movement. 10. Smoothing Energy Out in Front of the BodyThe flat palm of the left hand, which faces forward, is raised to a level justabove the head, in front of the body. The palm slides downward in a slanted lineand comes to the level of the pancreas and spleen, as if it were smoothing out avertical surface. Without stopping there, it continues moving to the back; thebody rotates to the left to allow the arm to come fully over the head. The hand,with the palm facing downward, then comes down with great force, as if to slap arubbery substance in front of the area of the pancreas and spleen (fig.226).img228.png [images/img228.png]Exactly the same movements are performed with The right arm, but using the areaof the liver and gallbladder as the striking point. 11. Hitting Energy in Front of the Face with an Upward Thrust of the FistThe trunk turns slightly to the left in order to allow the left arm two fullbackward rotations going first to the front, above the head, then to the kick,where the palm turns slightly inward as if to scoop something from the back(fig. 227).img229.png [images/img229.png] The movement ends at the second turnwith an upward thrust of the fisted hand in front of the face (fig.228).img230.png [images/img230.png] This magical pass is repeated with the right arm in exactly the same sequence. 12. Hammering Energy in Front of the Left and Right BodiesOne and a half forward circles are made with the arm, followed by a downwardstrike; the body rotates slightly in order to allow the left arm a full rotationstarting from its initial position by the side of the thigh to the back, abovethe head, to the front, and again to the side of the thigh. As this circle ismade, the palm is made to rotate at the wrist as if the hand were scooping upsome viscous matter (fig. 229).img231.png [images/img231.png] From its initialposition, the arm moves again to the back and above the head, where the handturns into a fist that strikes down, with great force, at a point in front ofand above the pancreas and spleen, using the soft edge of the hand like a hammeras the striking surface (fig. 230).img232.png [images/img232.png] The samemovements are repeated with the right arm. 13. Drawing Two Outward Circles of Energy and Smashing Them by the NavelBoth arms move in unison up the front of the body, out to the sides, and around,like a swimming stroke, to draw two winglike circles at forty-five-degree anglesto the front of the body (fig. 231).img233.png [images/img233.png] Then thecircles are broken at the bottom, at the level of the navel, with a forcefulstrike of both hands. The hands are bent at a ninety-degree angle in relation tothe forearms, with the fingers pointing forward. The force of the strike makesthe palms of the hands come within a few inches of each other (fig.232).img234.png [images/img234.png] 14. Drawing Two Circles of Energy Laterally with the Index and Middle FingersExtendedThe index and middle fingers of both hands are fully extended, while I ho thirdand fourth fingers are held by the thumbs against the palms.The arms circle in unison from their normal position at the sides to above thehead and then laterally to the sides of the body at forty-five degree anglestoward the back (fig. 233).img235.png [images/img235.png] When the full circleis nearly completed, the fingers contract into fists, leaving the secondknuckles of the middle fingers protruding. The movement ends as the fists, withthe palms facing the body, strike forward and upward, to the level of the chin(fig. 234).img236.png [images/img236.png] 15. Stirring the Energy Around the TemplesA long inhalation is taken. An exhalation begins as the arms are brought to apoint above the head, where they clasp into fists; the palms of the fisted handsface the front of the body. From there they strike downward with a back-fistblow to a point right above the hips (fig. 235).img237.png [images/img237.png]The fisted hands move to the sides of the body, drawing lateral half-circlesthat bring the fists to an area a few inches in front of the forehead and fiveor six inches away from each other. The fisted palms face outward (fig.236).img238.png [images/img238.png] While the exhalation still lasts, the fistsare brought to rest on the temples for an instant. The body leans backward a bitby bending slightly at the knees to gain spring and momentum, and then the armsare brought forcefully down, without straightening the elbows, to strike behindthe body on either side with the backs of the fisted hands (fig. 237).img239.png[images/img239.png] The exhalation ends there. 16. Projecting a Small Circle of Energy Out in Front of the BodyFrom its natural position by the side of the thigh, the left arm moves outwardlaterally; the palm of the hand faces the right. It draws a small circle as thepalm turns downward, comes to the area of the pancreas and spleen, and continuesmoving left to the level of the waist. The elbow protrudes acutely (fig.238a);img240.png [images/img240.png] the hand turns into a fist. The palm of thefisted hand faces the ground. The fist strikes with a short blow to the front,as if to pierce the circle it has drawn (fig. 238b).img241.png[images/img241.png] The movement is continuous; it is not interrupted when thehand turns into a fist, but stops only when the punch has been delivered. Theblow gives an intense jolt to the center of vitality located around the pancreasand spleen. The same movement is executed with the right hand, the strike ofwhich jolts the liver and gallbladder. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fourth Series: Second Group: Mixing Energy from the Left Body and the RightBodyThe second group consists of fourteen magical passes that mix the energy of bothbodies at their respective centers of vitality. The shamans of ancient Mexicobelieved that mixing energy in this fashion makes it possible to separate theenergy of both bodies more readily by dropping unfamiliar energy into them, aprocess which they described as exacerbating the centers of vitality. 17. Bunching Necessary Energy and Dispersing Unnecessary EnergyThis magical pass entails movements that could best be described as pushingsomething solid across the front of the body with the palm of the hand, anddragging it back across the front of the body with the back of the hand.It starts with the left arm kept close to the body, by the waist, with theforearm bent at a ninety-degree angle. The forearm is brought closer to the bodyas the movement begins, and the hand is bent back at the wrist. The palm of theleft hand faces right; the thumb is locked. Then, as if a great force wereopposing it, it moves across the body to the extreme right, without the elbowlosing its ninety-degree angle (fig. 239).img242.png [images/img242.png] Fromthere, again as if a great force were opposing it, the hand is dragged as farleft as it can reach without losing the ninety-degree angle of the elbow, withthe palm still facing the right (fig. 240).img243.png [images/img243.png]During this entire sequence of movements, the muscles of the left body arecontracted to the maximum, and the right arm is held immobile against the rightleg.The same sequence of movements is repeated with the right arm and hand. 18. Piling Energy onto the Left and Right BodiesThe weight is placed on the right leg. The knee is slightly bent for support andbalance. The left leg and arm, which are kept semitense, sweep in front of thebody in an arc from left to right, in unison. The left foot and the left handend at a position just to the right of the body. The outer edge of the left foottouches the ground. The fingertips of the left hand point down as the sweep ismade (fig. 241).img244.png [images/img244.png] Then both the left leg and theleft arm return to their original positions.The exact sequence is repeated by sweeping the right leg and arm to the left. 19. Gathering Energy with One Arm and Striking It with the OtherDon Juan said that with this magical pass, energy was stirred and collected withthe movement of one arm and was struck with the movement of the opposite arm. Hebelieved that striking, with one hand, energy which had been gathered by theother, allowed the entrance of energy into one body from sources belonging tothe other body, something which was never done under normal conditions.The left arm moves up to the level of the eyes. The wrist is slightly bentbackwards; in this position, going from left to right and back again, the handdraws the figure of an oval, about a foot and a half wide and as long as thewidth of the body (fig. 242).img245.png [images/img245.png] Then the hand, withthe palm facing down, moves across at eye level from left to right as if cuttingthrough, with the tips of the fingers, the figure which it has drawn (fig.243).img246.png [images/img246.png]At the moment that the left hand reaches the level of the right shoulder, theright hand, which is held at waist level with the cupped palm turned upward,shoots forward, striking with the heel of the hand, to hit the spot in themiddle of the oval drawn by the left hand, as the left hand is slowly broughtdown (fig. 244).img247.png [images/img247.png] As it strikes, the palm of theright hand is facing forward, and the fingers are slightly curved, permitting inthis fashion the necessary contour of the palm to strike a round surface. Thestrike ends with the elbow slightly bent, to avoid over stretching the tendons.The same movements are performed beginning with the right arm. 20. Gathering Energy with the Arms and LegsThe body pivots slightly to the right on the ball of the right foot; the leftleg juts out at a forty-five-degree angle, with the knee bent to give a forwardslant to the trunk. The body is made to rock three times, as if to gainmomentum. Then the left arm scoops downward as if to grab something at the levelof the left knee (fig. 245).img248.png [images/img248.png] The body leans back,and with that impulse, the lower part of the left leg, from the knee down, isbrought close to the groin, almost touching it with the heel; the left handswiftly brushes the vital area of the liver and gallbladder, on the right (fig.246).img249.png [images/img249.png]The same sequence of movements is repeated with the right leg and arm, whichbring the gathered energy to the center of vitality located around the pancreasand spleen, on the left. 21. Moving Energy from the Left and the Right ShouldersThe left arm moves from its natural position hanging by the left thigh to theright shoulder, where it grabs something, and the hand turns into a fist. Thismovement is propelled by a sharp twist of the waist to the right. The knees areslightly bent to allow this turning movement. The acutely bent elbow is notallowed to sag, but is kept at the level of the shoulders (fig. 247).img250.png[images/img250.png] Propelled by a straightening of the waist, the fist is thenmoved away from the right shoulder in an upward arc, striking, with the back ofthe hand, a point slightly above the head and in line with the left shoulder(fig. 248).img251.png [images/img251.png] The hand opens there as if to dropsomething that is held in the fist. The same- sequence of movements is repeatedwith the right arm. 22. Gathering Energy from One Body and Dispersing It on the OtherBeginning from its natural position by the left thigh, the left arm draws an arcfrom left to right, crossing in front of the pubis until it reaches the extremeright. This movement is aided by a slight turn of the waist. From there, the armcontinues moving in a circle above the head, to the height and level of the leftshoulder. It cuts across then to the level of the right shoulder. There, thehand turns into a fist, as if grabbing something, with the palm down (Fig.249).img252.png [images/img252.png] Next, the fist hits a point at the height ofthe head, an arm's length away from it. The blow is delivered with the soft edgeof the hand, using the hand as if it were a hammer.The arm is fully extended, but slightly curved at the elbow (fig.250).img253.png [images/img253.png] The same movements are repeated with theright arm. 23. Hammering Energy from the Left Shoulder and the Right Shoulder on theMidpoint in Front of the FaceThe left arm is moved above the head. The elbow is bent at a ninety-degreeangle. The hand turns there into a fist, with the palm facing upward. Then itstrikes from the left, with the soft edge of the hand, the division line of theleft and right body, in front of the face. The body leans slightly to the leftas this strike is made (fig. 251).img254.png [images/img254.png] The fisted handkeeps on moving until it almost touches the right shoulder; the palm turns thereso that it faces downward. Then it makes a similar strike, this time from theright; the body leans to the right (fig. 252).img255.png [images/img255.png]This same sequence of movements is repeated with the right arm.A reservoir of neutral energy can be built by this magical pass, meaning energywhich can easily be used by either the left body or the right body. 24. A Strike with the Hand Fisted at the Second KnuckleBoth arms are lifted to the level of the neck, the elbows held at ninety-degreeangles. The hands are held with the fingers bent at the second knuckle and heldtightly over the palm (figs. 253, 254).img256.png [images/img256.png]img257.png[images/img257.png] From this position, tin- left hand strikes. The strike is apowerful swing made to the right, .11 toss the line of the right shoulder, butwithout greatly moving the arm. 1 In- arm is driven by a powerful rightwardtwist of the waist (fig. 255).img258.png [images/img258.png]The right arm moves in the same fashion beyond the line of the left shoulder,driven by an instantaneous leftward twist of the waist. 25. Grabbing Energy from the Shoulders and Smashing It on the Centers ofVitalityThe left arm moves to the right shoulder, and the hand turns into a fist, as ifgrabbing something (fig. 256).img259.png [images/img259.png] The elbow is keptbent at a ninety degree angle. Then the fist is forcefully brought back to theleft side by the waist (fig. 257).img260.png [images/img260.png] It stays therefor an instant to gain impulse, and then the fist shoots across the body to theright, the fisted palm facing the body, to strike through a point by the area ofthe liver and gallbladder (fig. 258).img261.png [images/img261.png]The same movement is repeated with the right arm, which strikes across the areaof the pancreas and spleen. 26. Pushing Energy to the Sides with the ElbowsBoth arms are brought to the level of the shoulders, the elbows bent sharply andprotruding straight out. The wrists are crossed making a letter X, the leftforearm on top of the right one. The hands, clenched into fists, touch thepectoral muscles at the edges of the axilla; the left fist touches the edges ofthe right axilla and the right fist the edges of the left axilla (fig.259).img262.png [images/img262.png] The elbows are then forcefully brought outto the sides in line with the shoulders, as if to give an elbow blow to thesides (fig. 260).img263.png [images/img263.png] This movement is repeated withthe right arm on top of the left. 27. Drawing Two Inward Circles of Energy in Front of the Body and Crushing ThemOut to the SidesAs a deep breath is taken, the arms circle in unison from their natural positionat the sides of the thighs, to the line that separates the left and the rightbodies. This movement ends with the forearms crossed over the chest. The fingersare kept tightly together, pointing upward, the thumbs locked; the wrists arebent at ninety-degree angles. The left arm is on top of the right one. Thelocked thumb of the left hand touches the pectoral muscle of the right body, andthe locked thumb of the right hand touches the pectoral muscle of the left body(fig. 261).img264.png [images/img264.png] The inhalation ends there. A quickexhalation is made as the arms are spread apart forcefully with the handsclenched into fists, each striking, with the back of the hand, a point on therespective sides above the head (fig. 262).img265.png [images/img265.png]The same movements are repeated with the right arm on top of the left. 28. Striking Energy in Front of the Body and on the Left and Right with BothFistsThe hands are clenched into fists at the level of the waist. The palms of thefists face each other. Both hands are lifted to the level of the eyes and strikeforcefully downward in unison at two points in front of the groin; they hit thetarget with the soft part of the fists (fig. 263).img266.png [images/img266.png]From there, the arms swing in unison, making an upward arc to the left as thewhole trunk leans toward the left, following the impulse of the arms. The fistsstrike with the knuckles (fig. 264).img267.png [images/img267.png] The fistsreturn to deliver another blow to the same points in front of the groin. Fromthere, the arms swing in unison, making an upward arc to the right as the wholetrunk leans toward the right, following the impulse of the arms. The fistsstrike with the knuckles. The fists move one more time to deliver a blow withthe soft edge of the hands to the same two points in front of the groin. 29. Striking Energy in Front of the Body with Both Fists and on the Left and theRightThe beginning of this magical pass is exactly like the preceding one (fig.265).img268.png [images/img268.png] Once the strike is completed, both arms arelifted like hammers to the level of the head, and the trunk is made to turnsharply to the left. The two fists strike two points in front of the left hip(fig. 266).img269.png [images/img269.png] The arms lift again to the height ofthe head, the palms of the hands are opened, and they descend to strike the sametwo points (fig. 267).img270.png [images/img270.png] The arms are raised againto the level of the head. The hands turn into fists to strike the same pointsonce again. The forearms are raised to the level of the head, the body turns toface the front, and the fists are slammed down on the same points in front ofthe groin.The same sequence of movements is repeated with the trunk turned sharply to theright. 30. Smashing Energy with the Wrists Above the Head and on the Left and the RightBoth hands are raised above the head, with the wrists touching and the palmscurved as if holding a ball (fig. 268).img271.png [images/img271.png] Then thetrunk turns to the left, as both arms move sharply to the left of the waistwithout disengaging the wrists, which rotate on each other to accommodate thenew position of the hands. The palm of the left hand faces upward, and the palmof the right hand faces downward (fig. 269).img272.png [images/img272.png] Botharms are moved to the point above the head again, still without disengaging thewrists, which rotate to adopt their initial position.The same sequence of movements is performed by bringing the hands sharply to apoint to the right of the waist. The movement ends by bringing the hands back totheir starting position above the head. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fourth Series: Third Group: Moving the Energy of the Left Body and the RightBody with the BreathThe third group consists of nine magical passes that employ inhalations andexhalations as their driving force to either further separate or join the twobodies. As already stated, in the view of the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage,putting a dab of energy from one body into any vital center of the other createsa much sought-for momentary agitation in that center. The sorcerers of ancientMexico, according to what don Juan taught, considered this mixing to beextremely beneficial because it breaks the fixed, routine input of thosecenters. Those sorcerers felt that breathing is a key issue in the separation ofthe left body and the right body. 31. The Breath for the Upper Fringe of the LungsThe arms, with the hands clenched into fists, are raised to the forehead with adeep inhalation; the palms of the fisted hands face down. The fists are three orfour inches from each other, right in front of the forehead, as the inhalationends (fig. 270).img273.png [images/img273.png] An exhalation is made as the armsspread forcefully to two lateral points to the sides and even with the shoulders(fig. 271).img274.png [images/img274.png] The hands relax and open. The wristscross in front of the head and a deep inhalation is taken as the arms make twobig circles the length of the arms, going from the front, up over the head, andto the sides. The inhalation ends as the hands come to rest by the waist, withthe palms up (fig. 272).img275.png [images/img275.png] A slow exhalation is madethen, while the hands are raised along the edges of the rib cage, to the levelof the axillae. The exhalation ends as the shoulders are pushed up, as if theforce of the hands were making them rise (fig. 273).img276.png[images/img276.png]This breath is a true bonus because it allows the mobilization of the upper partof the lungs, a thing which hardly ever happens under normal conditions. 32. Offering the BreathThe left arm draws a circle as a deep inhalation is taken. It moves from thefront to above the head, to the back, to the front again; as the arm rotates,the trunk turns to the left, to allow the arm to move in a full circle. Theinhalation ends when the circle is completed. The palm of the hand is held atthe level of the chin; it faces up, and the wrist is bent at a ninety-degreeangle. The posture of the practitioner is that of one who is offering somethingwhich is placed on the palm. The trunk is bent forward (fig. 274).img277.png[images/img277.png] The palm of the hand is then turned to face down, and anexhalation begins while the arm moves slowly and powerfully downward (fig.275)img278.png [images/img278.png] to rest on the left side by the thigh; thepalm is still facing down, and the back of the hand maintains the ninety-degreeangle in relation to the forearm.The same sequence of movements is executed with the right arm. 33. Moving Energy with the Breath from the Top of the Head to the Vital CentersThe wrists of both arms are slightly bent; the palms of the hands aresemicurled. With the hands in this position, the tips of the fingers brushupward along the front of the body and over the head as a deep inhalation ismade (fig. 276).img279.png [images/img279.png] When the arms reach their fullextension above the head, the hands are straightened and the wrists are turnedback at a ninety-degree angle. The inhalation ends there. While the hands arebrought down, the air is held, and the index finger of each hand is raised; theother fingers are held against the palm, bent at the second knuckle, and thethumbs are locked. Both arms are retrieved to the level of the chest, with theback of the hands against the axillae.A deep exhalation begins then as the arms are slowly extended straight forwarduntil the elbows are gently locked. A deep inhalation then is taken as the handsare retrieved back to the position against the axillae, still with the indexfingers raised, the wrists bent backwards, the palms facing forward. A slowexhalation begins while the hands move upward in a circle that first reachesabove the head and then continues downward, making a complete forward circlewithout changing the position of the index fingers. The hands come to rest bythe sides of the rib cage (fig. 277).img280.png [images/img280.png] Theexhalation ends as the hands are pushed downward to the sides of the hips. 34. Shattering Energy with the BreathAs a deep inhalation is taken, the left hand moves in a wide side circle fromthe front, to above the head, to the back. The trunk turns to the left tofacilitate the full rotation of the arm. The inhalation ends when the arm hasmade a full turn and stops at a place to the side of the head and above it. Thepalm of the hand faces forward; the wrist is slightly turned back (fig.278).img281.png [images/img281.png] A slow exhalation begins then as the armmakes another wide side circle in the opposite direction, going from the frontdown to the back, then above the head, and to the front again. When the circleis completed, the arm is brought to a point just in front of the right shoulderas the exhalation continues. The palm is facing the body and lightly touches theright shoulder (fig. 279).img282.png [images/img282.png] Then the arm shoots outlaterally with the hand clenched in a fist and strikes, with the back of thehand, a point an arm's length away from the left shoulder at the height of thehead (fig. 280).img283.png [images/img283.png] The exhalation ends there. Thesame sequence of movements is repeated with the right arm. 35. The Monkey BreathThe knees are slightly bent. The arms are lifted slowly over the head as theupper part of the lungs is filled with air. Then the knees become locked and thebody is fully extended upward. This breath can be taken either with the heels onthe ground, or on the tips of the toes. The breath is held as the arms movedownward and the body stoops slightly forward, contracting the diaphragm; theknees are bent again. The exhalation begins when the hands reach the level ofthe waist. At the same time, the index fingers are extended and point to theground; the other fingers are contracted over the palms of the hands. The handscontinue moving downward as all the air is exhaled (fig. 281).img284.png[images/img284.png] While exhaling, the diaphragm is held fight in order toavoid pushing it downward with the exhaling air. 36. The Altitude BreathThe legs are held as straight as possible. An inhalation begins while theshoulders slowly rotate from Figure 281 the front to the back with the armsbent at the elbows. When the rotation and the inhalation end, the arms are keptin the initial position (fig. 282).img285.png [images/img285.png] The exhalationbegins by raising the hands to the level of the shoulders and extending the armsas far forward as possible with the palms facing the ground.Next, an inhalation is taken as the palms of the hands are turned upward. Theelbows are bent and pulled all the way back, and the shoulders are raised. Theinhalation ends with the maximum upward stretch of the shoulders (fig.283).img286.png [images/img286.png] An exhalation is made as the palms areturned to face the ground and the hands and shoulders push downward; the handsare bent backward at the wrists as far as possible, and the arms are heldstraight at the sides of the body. 37. The Lateral BreathAs an inhalation begins, the arms move from their natural position by the sidesof the thighs in a circle toward the center of the body, ending with the armscrossed; the palms face outward, and the wrists are fully bent so that thefingertips point upward (fig. 284).img287.png [images/img287.png] The inhalationcontinues while the two arms are pushed out laterally. As the arms move, thepalms of the hands first face forward; when the movement ends, they face awayfrom each other. The inhalation ends at the maximum extension of the arms. Thebody is kept as erect as possible (fig. 285).img288.png [images/img288.png]An exhalation is made by bending the arms at the elbows as the palms of thehands, with the fingertips raised upward, come toward the center of the body,pass it, and cross to end at the opposite edges of the body. The left forearm ison top of the right. The body is contracted at the mid-section, and the kneesare bent (fig. 286).img289.png [images/img289.png] 38. The Butterfly BreathThe arms are bent at the elbows and held in front of the chest. The left forearmis held above the right one without touching it; the wrists are straight and thehands are clenched into fists. The knees are bent, and the body stoops forwardmarkedly (fig. 287).img290.png [images/img290.png] As an inhalation begins, thearms separate and move up over the head and out to the left and right. As theinhalation continues, the arms straighten as they circle, going down, to thesides, and around the shoulders, and then fold back to their initial positionover the chest. Maintaining their position, the arms are raised over the head,as the breath is held and the body straightens at the waist (fig.288).img291.png [images/img291.png] Then the arms are brought down to the levelof the umbilical region as the body goes back into the initial stooped-forwardposition, with bent knees.The body holds that stooped-forward position steadily, and an exhalation is madeby repeating the same movements of the arms done for the inhalation. As the airis expelled, the diaphragm is kept in a fight position. 39. Breathing Out Through the ElbowsAt the beginning of this movement, the legs are kept straight. As a deep breathis taken, the arms make outward circles above the head and around the sides ofthe body. The inhalation ends with the arms pointing straight out to the front,elbows bent, at the level of the waist. The palms are held straight and facingeach other; the fingers are together.An exhalation begins as the hands point to the ground at a forty-five-degreeangle. The knees are bent and the body leans forward (fig. 289).img292.png[images/img292.png] I lie exhalation continues while the arms, bent at theelbows in a ninety-degree angle, are raised over the head. The body straightensand leans backward slightly. This is achieved by bending the knees, rather thanthe back. The exhalation ends with the abdominal muscles tensed to the maximum;the head is tilted slightly backward (fig. 290).img293.png [images/img293.png]Practicing this breath creates the sensation that air is being expelled throughthe elbows. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fourth Series: Fourth Group: The Predilection of the Left Body and the RightBodyThis group is composed of five magical passes for the left body executed in asequence, and three magical passes for the right body. According to don JuanMatus, the predilection of the left body is silence, while the predilection ofthe right body is chatter, noise, sequential order. He said that it is the rightbody which forces us to march, because it likes parades, and it's most delightedwith choreography, sequences, and arrangements that entail classification bysize.Don Juan recommended that the performance of each movement of the magical passesfor the right be repeated many times, as the practitioners count, and that it isvery important to set up beforehand the number of times in which any givenmovement is going to be repeated, because prediction is the forte of the rightbody. If the practitioners set up any number beforehand and fulfill it, thepleasure of the right body is indescribable.In the practice of Tensegrity, however, both the magical passes for the leftbody and the magical passes for the right body are performed in completesilence. If the silence of the left body can be made to overlap onto the rightbody, the act of saturation can become a direct way to enter what don Juancalled the most coveted state that the shamans of every generation sought: innersilence. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fourth Series: Fourth Group: The Five Magical Passes for the Left BodyThe magical passes for the left body have no individual names. Don Juan saidthat the shamans of ancient Mexico called them just magical passes for the leftbody. The first magical pass consists of fifteen carefully executed brief movements.Since the magical passes for the left body are done in a sequence, they aregoing to be numbered sequentially.1. The left arm moves laterally about a foot away from its natural position bythe thigh (fig. 291).img294.png [images/img294.png]2. The palm is turned sharply to face the front as the elbow is slightly bent(fig. 292).img295.png [images/img295.png]3. The hand is raised to the level of the navel and cuts across to the right(fig. 293).img296.png [images/img296.png]4. The hand is turned sharply until the palm faces down (fig. 294).img297.png[images/img297.png]5. The hand cuts across from right to left with the palm of the hand facing down(fig. 295).img298.png [images/img298.png]6. The wrist turns sharply to the right; the hand is cupped, as if to scoopsomething, and the movement of the wrist makes it move upward with a jolt (fig.296).img299.png [images/img299.png]7. The arm is raised in an arc in front of the line dividing the two bodies tothe level of the eyes, a foot away from it, with the palm of the hand facingleft (fig. 297).img300.png [images/img300.png]8. The wrist turns, making the hand face forward (fig. 298).img301.png[images/img301.png]9. The arm goes out over the head, draws a lateral circle, and returns to thesame position in front of the eyes with the palm of the hand facing left (fig.299).img302.png [images/img302.png]10. The wrist moves again to make the palm of the hand face forward (fig.300).img303.png [images/img303.png]11. The hand moves down toward the left, in a slight curve to the level of theshoulders, with the palm facing the ground (fig. 301).img304.png[images/img304.png]12. The wrist is turned so the palm faces up (fig. 302).img305.png[images/img305.png]13. The hand cuts to the right, to a point in front of the right shoulder (fig.303).img306.png [images/img306.png]14. The wrist moves again, turning the palm down (fig. 304).img307.png[images/img307.png]15. The hand sweeps down to a position about a foot in front of the left hip(fig. 305).img308.png [images/img308.png] The second magical pass is composed of nine movements.16. The hand is retrieved and touches the crest of the hip (fig. 306).img309.png[images/img309.png]17. The elbow moves out laterally, and the wrist, by a sharp downward movement,turns the palm to face the left. The palm of the hand is cupped, the fingersslightly spread (fig. 307).img310.png [images/img310.png]18. The arm makes a full circle, going over the head from front to back. Thehand returns to the crest of the hip with the palm facing up (fig.308).img311.png [images/img311.png]19. The elbow moves out laterally again, and another quick movement of the wristturns the palm to face the left again (fig. 309).img312.png [images/img312.png]20. The hand moves to the side to make a circle as if scooping something. At theend of the movement, the hand returns to a position at the crest of the hip withthe palm facing up (fig. 310).img313.png [images/img313.png]21. The bent elbow moves sharply to the left at the same time that a quick turnof the wrist turns the hand back; the fingers, slightly curved, point to theback; the palm is hollowed and faces up (fig. 311).img314.png[images/img314.png]22. Then the elbow is fully extended to the back while the palm of the cuppedhand still faces up (fig. 312).img315.png [images/img315.png]23. While the arm is still fully extended, the wrist turns over slowly, making afull rotation, until the palm faces up again (fig. 313).img316.png[images/img316.png]24. This movement resembles pulling the arm out of a sleeve. Leading with theelbow, the arm draws a circle from back to front, and the movement ends with thepalm of the hand up, at the level of the edge of the rib cage, and the bentelbow touching the edge of the ribs (fig. 314).img317.png [images/img317.png] The third magical pass is made up of twelve movements.25. The hand moves in an arc to the right with the palm facing up, as if cuttingsomething with the tips of the fingers, stopping a foot past the right edge ofthe rib cage (fig. 315).img318.png [images/img318.png]26. The palm of the hand is turned to face the ground (fig. 316).img319.png[images/img319.png]27. The arm moves in an arc to the left and then all the way to the back (fig.317).img320.png [images/img320.png]28. The palm of the hand is hollow, the arm is fully extended, and the turn ofthe wrist makes the hand into a scoop (fig. 318).img321.png [images/img321.png]29. The hand moves above the head, following a diagonal course from the back tothe front that ends above the right shoulder at the level of the head (fig.319).img322.png [images/img322.png]30. The hand is straightened out and the wrist is contracted to place it in aninety-degree angle with the forearm. The hand descends this way from above thehead to the right of the waist (fig. 320).img323.png [images/img323.png]31. The palm is turned briskly downward (fig. 321).img324.png[images/img324.png]32. The arm swings in a half-circle all the way to the left and to the back(fig. 322).img325.png [images/img325.png]33. The palm turns up (fig. 323).img326.png [images/img326.png]34. The arm swings to the front, to the same position on the right, a foot awayfrom the rib cage (fig. 324).img327.png [images/img327.png]35. The hand is turned so the palm faces the ground again (fig. 325).img328.png[images/img328.png]36. The arm swings to the left and returns to the same point behind the back onthe left side (fig. 326).img329.png [images/img329.png] The fourth magical pass consists of fifteen movements.37. The arm swings in a big circle to the front, above the head, and to theback, and ends at a point about a foot away from the left thigh (fig.327).img330.png [images/img330.png]38. The head is turned to the left. The elbow is bent sharply and the forearm israised to the level of the eyes, with the palm of the hand facing outward, as ifshielding the eyes from light glare. The body stoops forward (fig.328).img331.png [images/img331.png]39. The head and trunk rotate slowly all the way to the right, as if to look inthe distance with a shield over the eyes (fig. 329).img332.png[images/img332.png]40. The head and trunk rotate again to the left (fig. 330).img333.png[images/img333.png]41. The palm of the hand is quickly turned to face up as the head and trunk moveto look straight forward (fig. 331).img334.png [images/img334.png]42. Then the hand cuts a line in front of the body from left to right (fig.332).img335.png [images/img335.png]43. The palm is turned to face down (fig. 333).img336.png [images/img336.png]44. The arm sweeps to the left (fig. 334).img337.png [images/img337.png]45. The wrist is turned again in order to have the palm facing up (fig.335).img338.png [images/img338.png]46. The arm cuts another arc in front of the body to the right (fig.336).img339.png [images/img339.png]47. The position of the hand is changed again; the palm faces down (fig.337).img340.png [images/img340.png]48. The arm sweeps again to the left (fig. 338).img341.png [images/img341.png]49. The palm is turned to face upward (fig. 339).img342.png [images/img342.png]50. The arm makes a line across the front of the body to the right (fig.340).img343.png [images/img343.png]51. The palm is turned to face down (fig. 341).img344.png [images/img344.png] The fifth magical pass is made up of twenty-five movements.52. The hand draws a large circle in front of the body, with the palm of thehand facing forward as the circle is drawn. The movement ends at a point infront of the right shoulder; the palm is facing up (fig. 342).img345.png[images/img345.png]53. The elbow turns up as the wrist and hand turn to face down. The palm of thehand is slightly hollowed (fig. 343).img346.png [images/img346.png]54. The hand draws an oval-shaped line from right to left as if scooping a chunkof matter. When it comes to the position where it started, the palm is facing up(fig. 344).img347.png [images/img347.png]55. The hand drops to the level of the groin, fingers pointing to the ground(fig. 345).img348.png [images/img348.png]56. The palm of the hand is turned to face the body (fig. 346).img349.png[images/img349.png]57. Then it moves, following the contour of the body, fingers pointing towardthe ground, to a place four or five inches away from the left thigh (fig.347).img350.png [images/img350.png]58. A quick turn of the wrist makes the palm face the thigh (fig.348).img351.png [images/img351.png]59. The head turns to the left as the hand is raised, as if rubbing the fingersalong a straight surface, to the level of the eyes (fig. 349).img352.png[images/img352.png]60. From there, it descends at an angle to a point slightly to the left side ofthe groin. The head follows the movement of the hand (fig. 350).img353.png[images/img353.png]61. The hand is raised again to tin- level of the eyes at an angle. It reaches apoint exactly on the division line of the left and right bodies, right in frontof the eyes, a foot and a half away from them (fig. 351).img354.png[images/img354.png]62. The hand descends again at an angle, to a point in front and slightly to theright of the groin (fig. 352).img355.png [images/img355.png]63. The hand is raised again, drawing another slanted line, to a point in frontof the eyes in line with the shoulders; the head follows the movement to theright (fig. 353),img356.png [images/img356.png]64. The hand descends in a straight line to a point a foot away from the rightthigh (fig. 354).img357.png [images/img357.png] In the seven preceding movements, three peaks have been drawn: the first one onthe left, the second one on the very center dividing line, and the third to theright.65. The hand changes position so the palm faces left (fig. 355).img358.png[images/img358.png]66. The hand is raised to draw a curved line that fits exactly in between theright and center peaks drawn before (fig. 356).img359.png [images/img359.png]67. There the palm of the hand is made to face the right (fig. 357).img360.png[images/img360.png]68. The hand descends to the level of the groin and stops at the dividing linebetween the left and the right bodies (fig. 358).img361.png [images/img361.png]69. The palm changes directions there again and faces left (fig. 359).img362.png[images/img362.png]70. The hand is raised to a point between the middle peak and the left peak atthe level of the eyes (fig. 360).img363.png [images/img363.png]71. The palm is turned to face right (fig. 361).img364.png [images/img364.png]72. The hand descends all the way down to the point in front of the thigh whereit began (fig. 362).img365.png [images/img365.png] The peaks drawn in the eight movements of this second phase are slightly round,as opposed to the very angular peaks drawn before.73. The hand is turned once more to have the palm face forward (fig.363).img366.png [images/img366.png]74. The arm moves over the head as if to pour on the right face and body aninvisible substance (fig. 364).img367.png [images/img367.png]75. The hand is dropped down (fig. 365).img368.png [images/img368.png] Making ahalf-circle, the elbow rotates to the back (fig. 366).img369.png[images/img369.png]76. As if it were a knife going into its sheath, the hand slides over the centerof vitality around the pancreas and the spleen (fig. 367).img370.png[images/img370.png] ================================================================= "},{"pageContent":"The Fourth Series: Fourth Group: The Three Magical Passes for the Right BodyThe first magical pass for the right body consists of five movements.1. The right hand, at a ninety-degree angle to the forearm and with the palmfacing front, makes a complete circle from left to right, to the level of theright ear, and comes to rest at the same position that it started, about a footin front of the waist (fig. 368).img371.png [images/img371.png]2. From there, the arm moves in a sharp arc at the level of the chest by acutelybending the elbow. The palm faces the ground; the fingers are held together andstraight with the thumb locked. The index finger and thumb nearly touch thechest (fig. 369).img372.png [images/img372.png]3. The forearm moves briskly away from the chest so that the elbow is bent at aforty-five-degree angle (fig. 370).img373.png [images/img373.png]4. The hand rotates on the wrist; the fingers point to the ground for an instantand then flip up above the head, as if the hand were a knife (fig.371).img374.png [images/img374.png]5. The hand descends. Using its outer edge as if it were a cutting tool, it cutsto the level of the navel (fig. 372).img375.png [images/img375.png] The second magical pass for the right body consists of the following twelvemovements.6. From the side of the waist, the hand shoots out to a point in front of thebody. At the arm's maximum extension, the fingers separate (figs.373,374).img376.png [images/img376.png]img377.png [images/img377.png]7. The arm is retrieved to the level of the waist. The elbow protrudes back,sharply bent (fig. 375).img378.png [images/img378.png]8. The hand is turned so that the palm faces up (fig. 376).img379.png[images/img379.png]9. The arm is extended forward with the palm open and facing up (fig.377).img380.png [images/img380.png]10. With the palm still facing up, the arm returns again to the level of thewaist (fig. 378).img381.png [images/img381.png]11. The palm is turned to face downward (fig. 379).img382.png[images/img382.png]12. The arm makes a full side circle, going to the back, above the head, and tothe front, and ends in front of the navel by slamming the palm down as if itwere hitting something solid (fig. 380).img383.png [images/img383.png]13. The palm is turned toward the body, in a movement that resembles the actionof gathering something on the right body (fig. 381).img384.png[images/img384.png]14. The arm is raised above the head as if the hand were a knife that is beingwielded (fig. 382).img385.png [images/img385.png]15. It makes a diagonal cut to the midpoint in front of the body, a foot and ahalf away from it. The palm is facing left (fig. 383).img386.png[images/img386.png]16. The hand, with the palm straight, is raised to the level of the face, in astraight line (fig. 384).img387.png [images/img387.png]17. It makes a diagonal cut with the palm slightly slanted downward to a pointin front of the edge of the right body, a foot and a half away from it (fig.385).img388.png [images/img388.png] The third magical pass for the right body is made up of twelve movements.18. The right arm, with the elbow sharply bent toward the right and the handheld with the palm toward the body, moves in an arc from the right side to apoint in front of the solar plexus (fig. 386).img389.png [images/img389.png]19. Pivoting on the elbow, the forearm makes a quarter of a circle downward,turning the palm to face the right side (fig. 387).img390.png[images/img390.png]20. The arm makes a small outward circle, from left to right, going up, thendown again, and ending with the palm by the waist, facing up (figs. 388a,388b).img391.png [images/img391.png]img392.png [images/img392.png]21. Another circle from the front to the back is made. It ends up at the pointwhere it started, with the palm of the hand facing up (fig. 389).img393.png[images/img393.png]22. The palm is turned to face down (fig. 390).img394.png [images/img394.png]23. The hand then moves slowly to the front (fig. 391).img395.png[images/img395.png]24. The wrist is turned so the palm faces the left. With a straight palm,fingers held tightly together, and thumb locked, the hand is raised straight upas if it were a knife (fig. 392).img396.png [images/img396.png]25. Then it draws a small convex arc to the left, so that the palm flips to faceright, and cuts straight down just to the left of the line drawn previously, tothe level of the navel (fig. 393).img397.png [images/img397.png]26. With the hand still facing right, it moves upward and retraces the same lineit drew before (fig. 394).img398.png [images/img398.png] In the preceding three movements, a long oval figure has been drawn.27. Then the hand cuts down, as if to cut off one-third of the long figure (fig.395).img399.png [images/img399.png]28. The palm turns to face right again (fig. 396).img400.png [images/img400.png]29. It scoops whatever it has cut and has turned into a ball, and splashes it onthe front of the right body (figs. 397, 398).img401.png[images/img401.png]img402.png [images/img402.png]30. The hand is dropped down to the crest of the right hip (fig. 399).img403.png[images/img403.png]31. The hand rotates as the arm makes a half-circle going from the front (fig.400)img404.png [images/img404.png] to the back, stopping behind the rightshoulder (fig. 401).img405.png [images/img405.png]32. As if it were a knife going into its sheath, the hand slides over the energycenter around the liver and gallbladder (figs. 402, 403).img406.png[images/img406.png]img407.png [images/img407.png]=============================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fifth Series: The Masculinity SeriesMasculinity was the name given to a specific group of magical passes by theshamans who first discovered and used them. Don Juan thought that perhaps it wasthe oldest name given to any such group of magical passes. This group waspracticed originally for generations only by male shaman practitioners, and thisdiscrimination in favor of male shamans was done not out of necessity, butrather for reasons of ritual and to satisfy an original drive for malesupremacy. Nevertheless, this drive was soon terminated under the impact ofenhanced perception.The well-established tradition of this group of magical passes being practicedonly by men persisted in a pseudo-official way for generations while it wasbeing practiced on the sly by female practitioners as well. The old sorcerers'rationale for including females was that for reasons of strife and socialdisorder around them, the women needed extra strength and vitality, which theybelieved was found only in males who practiced this group of magical passes.Therefore, women were allowed to execute the movements as a token of solidarity.In don Juan's time, the division lines between males and females became evenmore diffused. The secrecy and exclusivity of the old sorcerers was completelyshattered, and even the old rationale for allowing women to practice thesespecific magical passes could not be upheld. Female practitioners performedthese magical passes openly.The value of this group of magical passes - the oldest named group in existence- is its continuity. All of its magical passes were generic from the beginning,and this condition provided the only instance in don Juan's lineage of sorcerersin which a whole party of shaman practitioners, whatever their number may havebeen, were allowed to move in unison. The number of participants in any parry ofsorcerers, throughout the ages, could never have been more than sixteen.Therefore, none of those sorcerers were ever in the position to witness thestupendous energetic contribution of human mass. For them, there existed onlythe specialized consensus of a few initiates, a consensus which brought in thepossibility of idiosyncratic preferences and more isolationism.The fact that the movements of Tensegrity are practiced in seminars andworkshops by hundreds of participants at the same time has given rise, as statedbefore, to the possibility of experiencing the energetic effects of human mass.Such an energetic effect is twofold: not only are the participants of Tensegrityperforming an activity that unites them energetically, but they are alsoinvolved in a quest delineated in states of enhanced awareness by the shamans ofancient Mexico: the redeployment of energy. Performing these magical passes inthe setting of seminars on Tensegrity is a unique experience. It permits theparticipants to arrive, pushed or pulled by the magical passes themselves and bythe human mass, at energetic conclusions never even alluded to in don Juan'steachings.The reason for calling this set of movements Masculinity is its aggressivequality, and because its magical passes are very brisk and forcefully executed,characteristics easily identified with maleness. Don Juan stated that theirpractice fostered not only a sensation of well-being, but a special sensorialquality, which, if not examined, could easily be confused with strife andaggressiveness. However, if it is carefully scrutinized, it is immediatelyapparent that it is, rather, an unmistakable sensation of readiness that placesthe practitioners at a level from which they could strike toward the unknown.Another reason that the shamans of ancient Mexico called this group of magicalpasses Masculinity was because the males who practiced it became a special typeof practitioner who didn't need to be taken by the hand. They became men whobenefited indirectly from everything they did. Ideally, the energy generated bythis group of magical passes goes to the centers of vitality themselves, as ifevery center made an automatic bidding for energy, which goes first to thecenter that needs it the most.For don Juan Matus's disciples, this set of magical passes became the mostcrucial element in their training. Don Juan himself introduced it to them as acommon denominator, meaning that he urged them to practice the set unaltered.What lie wanted was to prepare his disciples to withstand the rigors ofjourneying in the unknown.In Tensegrity, the word Series has been added to the name Masculinity to put iton a par with the other series of Tensegrity. The Masculinity Series is dividedinto three groups, each consisting of ten magical passes. The goal of the firstand second groups of the Masculinity Series is the tuning of tendon energy. Eachof these twenty magical passes is short, but extremely focused. Tensegritypractitioners are seriously encouraged, as the shamanistic practitioners ofancient times were, to get the maximum effect from the short movements by aimingto release a jolt of tendon energy every time they execute them.\"But don't you think, don Juan, that every time I release this jolt of energy,I'm actually wasting my tendon energy, and draining it out of me?\" I asked himon one occasion.\"You can't drain any energy out of yourself,\" he said. \"The energy that you areseemingly wasting by delivering a jolt to the air is not really being wasted,because it never leaves your boundaries, wherever those boundaries may be. Sowhat you're really doing is delivering a jolt of energy to what the sorcerers ofancient Mexico called our 'crust,' our 'bark.' Those sorcerers stated thatenergetically, human beings are like luminous balls that have a thick peelaround them, like an orange; some of them have something even harder andthicker, like the bark of an old tree.\"Don Juan explained carefully that this simile of human beings being like anorange was somehow misleading because the peel or the bark that we have islocated inside our boundaries, just as if an orange had its peel inside theorange itself. He said that this bark or peel was the crusted-down energy thathad been discarded throughout our lifetime from our vital centers of energy,because of the wear and tear of daily life.\"Is it beneficial to hit this bark, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Most beneficial,\" he said. \"Especially if the practitioners aim all theirintent at reaching that bark with their blows. If they intend to shatterportions of this crusted-down energy by means of the magical passes, thatshattered energy could be absorbed by the vital centers of energy.\"The magical passes of the third group of the Masculinity Series are broader,more extensive. What practitioners need in order to execute the ten magicalpasses of the third group is steadiness of the hands, the legs, and the rest ofthe body. The aim of this third series, for the shamans of ancient Mexico, wasthe building of endurance, of stability.Those shamans believed that holding the body steadily in position whileexecuting those long movements gives the practitioners a foothold from whichthey can stand on their own.What modem practitioners of Tensegrity have found out through their practice isthat the Masculinity Series can be executed only in moderation, in order toavoid overtiring the tendons of the arms and the muscles of the back. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"The Fifth Series: First Group: Magical Passes in Which the Hands Are Moved inUnison but Held Separately1. Fists Above the ShouldersThe hands are held by the sides, clasped into fists, the palms facing up. Theyare raised then to a point above the head by bending the elbows so the forearmsare at a ninety-degree angle with the upper arms. The driving force of thismovement is equally divided between the muscles of the arms and the contractionof the muscles of the abdomen. As the fists are raised and the muscles of thefront of the body are tensed, the body leans slightly backward by bending theknees (fig. 404).img408.png [images/img408.png] The arms, with hands fisted, arebrought down to the sides of the thighs by straightening the elbows a bit; asthe arms move down, the body leans forward, contracting the muscles of the backand the diaphragm (fig. 405).img409.png [images/img409.png] 2. Using a Cutting Tool in Each HandThe hands are made into fists, with the palms facing each other at the level ofthe waist (fig. 406).img410.png [images/img410.png] From there, they move in adownward strike to the level of the groin, a foot and a half away from it,always keeping the width of the body as the distance between the fists (fig.407).img411.png [images/img411.png] Once the fists strike, they are retrieved tothe position where they started, by the edge of the rib cage. 3. Polishing a High Table with the Palms of the HandsThe arms are raised to the level of the axillae. The palms of the hands facedown. The elbows, acutely bent, protrude sharply behind the back (fig.408).img412.png [images/img412.png] Both arms are brought briskly forward to themaximum extension, as if the palms were actually polishing a hard surface. Thehands are kept at a distance which equals the width of the body (fig.409).img413.png [images/img413.png] From there, they are retrieved with equalforce to the position where the movement began (fig. 408). 4. Tapping Energy with Both HandsBoth arms are raised to the front, at the level of the shoulders. The hands areheld in angular fists, meaning that the position of the fingers slants downheavily as they are held against the palm of the hands. The thumbs are held ontop of the outer edge of the index fingers (fig. 410).img414.png[images/img414.png] The palms of the hands face each other. A sharp jolt of thewrists makes the fists go down slightly, but with great force. The level of thewrists never changes; in other words, only the hand pivots down on the wrists.The counter movement is to raise the fists with a jolt without changing theposition of the wrists (fig. 411).img415.png [images/img415.png]This magical pass is, for shamans, one of the best sources for exercising thetendon energy of the arms, because of the number of energy points that existaround the wrists, the backs of the hands, the palms, and the fingers. 5. Jolting EnergyThis magical pass is the companion to the preceding one. It begins by raisingboth arms to the front at the level of the shoulders. The hands are held inangular fists, just as in the preceding magical pass, except that in this one,the palms of the hands are turned to face downward. The fists are moved intoward the body by a jolt of the wrists. Its counterbalancing movement isanother jolt of the wrists that sends the fists outward so that the thumbs makea straight line with the rest of the forearm (fig. 412).img416.png[images/img416.png] In order to execute this magical pass, it is required thatthe muscles of the abdomen are intensely used. It is the action of those muscleswhich actually directs the jolting of the wrists. 6. Pulling a Rope of EnergyThe hands are held in front of the body, at the line that separates the left andthe right bodies, as if they were holding a thick rope that hangs from above;the left hand is on top of the right (fig. 413).img417.png [images/img417.png]The magical pass consists in jolting both wrists and making the hands jerk downin a short, powerful movement. As this movement is executed, the muscles of theabdomen contract, and the arms drop down slightly by bending the knees (fig.414).img418.png [images/img418.png]Its counterbalancing movement is a jerk of the wrists that jolts the handsupward as the knees and the trunk straighten up a bit (fig. 413). 7. Pushing Down a Pole of EnergyThe hands are held to the left of the body, the left hand at the level of theear, eight or nine inches above the right hand, which is held at the shoulder.They are held as if they were grabbing a thick pole. The palm of the left handfaces the right; and the palm of the right hand faces left. The left hand is theleading hand, by virtue of being on top, and guides the movement (fig.415).img419.png [images/img419.png] The muscles of the back by the area of theadrenals and the muscles of the abdomen contract, and a powerful push sends botharms downward to the side of the right thigh and the waist, as if they wereindeed holding on to a pole (fig. 416).img420.png [images/img420.png] The handschange position there; the right hand moves to a place by the right ear andbecomes the leading hand, and the left moves below, by the shoulder, as if thehands were changing poles. The same movements are repeated. 8. Cut ting Energy with One Hand at a TimeThe fists arc raised on the sides until they touch the edge of the rib cage; thepalms of the fists face each other (fig. 417).img421.png [images/img421.png] Theleft arm moves down in a diagonal line to a point two feet away from the thigh(fig. 418);img422.png [images/img422.png] then it is retrieved (fig. 417). Theright arm immediately performs the same movements. 9. Using a Plane of EnergyThe left hand is raised to the level of the navel and made into a fist; theelbow is bent at a ninety-degree angle and is held close to the rib cage (fig.419).img423.png [images/img423.png] The right palm moves as if to slam on top ofthe left fist. The right hand stops an inch away from the left (fig.420).img424.png [images/img424.png] Then it moves four or five inches in frontof the fist, in a sharp, cutting movement, as if cutting with the edge of thehand (fig. 421).img425.png [images/img425.png] The left arm is retrieved all theway back by making the elbow protrude backward as far as it can, while the righthand is also retrieved, following the left hand and keeping the same distance(fig. 422).img426.png [images/img426.png] Then, maintaining the same distancebetween the hands, both the left and the right arm shoot forward to a point afoot and a half or two feet away from the waist.The same movements are repeated with the fist of the right arm. 10. Striking Energy with a Spike of EnergyThe left arm is raised to the level of the shoulders with the elbow bent at aninety-degree angle. The hand is held as if it had the hilt of a dagger in itsgrip; the palm faces down. The elbow strikes backward in an arc to a point atthe height of the left shoulder, at a forty-five-degree angle behind it (fig.423).img427.png [images/img427.png] Then the arm returns with a strike along thesame arc to its initial position.The same movement is repeated with the other arm. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fifth Series: Second Group: The Magical Passes for Focusing Tendon Energy11. Clasping HandsBoth forearms are brought forward in front of the navel. The bent elbows almosttouch the rib cage. The hands are made to clasp, the left hand on top. Thefingers of each hand grab the other hand forcefully (fig. 424).img428.png[images/img428.png] All the muscles of the arms and the back are contracted.Then the tense muscles are relaxed and the hands change positions so that theright hand is on top of the left, without letting go of each other, using thehard part of the palm at the base of the fingers as a pivoting surface; themuscles of the arms and back are contracted again.The same movements are repeated, beginning with the right hand on top 12. Left and Right Body ClaspThe forearms are brought in front of the body, again at the level of the navel.This time, however, the right forearm is held extended out in a straight linewith the hip. It is held close to the rib cage while the left forearm, with theelbow away from the body, puts the left hand over the right one in a claspingposition. Great pressure is applied to the palms and the fingers of each hand bythe tension of the muscles of the arms, the back, and the abdomen. The tensionis relaxed, and the hands are made to pivot on each other's palms, as they moveacross the body from right to left. There, they are forcefully clasped again,using the same muscles, this time with the right hand on top (fig.425).img429.png [images/img429.png]The same movements are repeated from this position. 13. The Sharp Turn of the Two BodiesThe hands are clasped at the level of the waist, to the right. The left hand ison top of the right. In this magical pass, (In- squeeze- of the hands is not aspronounced as the one in the two preceding ones, because what is sought is asharp turn of the two bodies, rather than the sharp strikes of the two precedingpasses.The clasped hands are made to draw a small circle to the right that goes fromthe front to the back, and ends in the same position where it started. Since theleading hand is the left hand, by the fact that it is on top, the circle isdrawn following the impulse of the left arm, which pushes the hands out first tothe right, and around in a circle to the right of the body (fig. 426).img430.png[images/img430.png]Then the clasped hands move across the front of the body to the left side.Another circle is drawn there, again following the impulse of the left hand.Being on top, it pulls the other hand to make a circle that goes to the backfirst, out to the left, and back to the place where it started (fig.427).img431.png [images/img431.png]The same sequence of movements is performed with the right hand in the lead,starting at the left by the waist. This time, the impulse of the right arm isfollowed in order to draw the circle, which goes to the left first, and thenback to the same place where it started (fig. 428).img432.png[images/img432.png] The clasped hands move across the front of the body to theright side by the waist. There, following the impulse of the leading hand, theyare pulled back, then to the right, and back where they started, making a circle(fig. 429).img433.png [images/img433.png] It is important that as the circlesare drawn, the trunk of the body is turned sharply to the side. The legs remainin the same position, without compensating for the turn by letting the kneessag. 14. Pushing Clasped Energy with the Elbow and ForearmThe hands are clasped by the right side at the level of the shoulder. The upperpart of the right arm is held fight against the chest, and the elbow is sharplybent with the forearm held in a vertical position. With the palm of the righthand facing up, the back of the hand is held in a ninety-degree angle with theforearm (fig. 430).img434.png [images/img434.png]The elbow of the left arm is extended in front of the left shoulder, held at aninety-degree position. The two hands clasp forcefully (fig. 431).img435.png[images/img435.png] The right arm slowly pushes the left one forward bystraightening the elbow quite a bit. At the same time that the clasped hands arepushed forward, the left shoulder and shoulder blade are also pushed forward tomaintain the ninety-degree angle of the left elbow (fig. 432).img436.png[images/img436.png] The right arm retrieves the left hand to the initialposition.The clasped hands are shifted to the left side by pivoting on the palms, and thesame movements are repeated there. 15. The Short Stab with the Hands ClaspedThe hands are clasped at the right side, just as in the preceding magical pass.This lime, however, the hands are at the level of the waist, and the right arm,instead of slowly pushing the left one forward, stabs fast (fig. 433).img437.png[images/img437.png] It is a powerful movement that requires the contraction ofthe muscles of the arms and the back. The clasped hands are brought forcefullyto the left, as if to augment the driving force of the left elbow, which ispushed all the way to the back (fig. 434).img438.png [images/img438.png] Theclasped hands move around the front of the body to the right, as if to aid againa powerful movement of the right elbow which is thrown all the way to the back.The same sequence of movements is performed by starting it on the left side withthe right hand in the lead.It is important to note that when the clasped hands are stabbed to the front,the hand at the bottom gives the direction, but the force is supplied by theleading hand, which is on top. 16. Jolting Energy with Clasped HandsThe hands are clasped to the right; the right elbow and upper arm are heldagainst the side of the rib cage. The elbow of the right arm is at aninety-degree angle with the extended right forearm. The left elbow is also heldat a ninety-degree angle, at a straight line away from the left pectoral muscle(fig. 435).img439.png [images/img439.png] The right arm lifts the left one,changing the position of the elbows from a ninety-degree angle to a forty-five.The clasped hands reach the level of the right shoulder (fig. 436).img440.png[images/img440.png] Then they are made to jolt with a very short movement inwhich only the wrist is involved. The clasped hands hit down, but withoutchanging the level at which they are held (fig. 437).img441.png[images/img441.png] From there, the clasped hands are retrieved to the left nearthe waist, in a forceful movement that makes the left elbow protrude at the back(fig. 438).img442.png [images/img442.png] The wrists are rotated and the handsmade to pivot on each other, reversing their position. The same movements arerepeated on the left. 17. Jolting Energy by the KneesThe hands are clasped to the right by the thigh. They change positions slightlyby the supporting right hand, which is on the bottom, becoming slightly morevertical with a twist of the wrist, held in check by the pressure of the lefthand (fig. 439).img443.png [images/img443.png] Both hands swing to the left,following the contour of the knees, and deliver a strike, the potency of whichis enhanced by a downward pull of the wrists (fig. 440).img444.png[images/img444.png]The hands change position by rotating on each other's palms, and the samemovements are repeated from left to right. 18. Driving Down a Spike of EnergyThe hands are clasped vertically with the left hand in the lead, at a pointabout a foot from the navel, right on the division line between the left andright bodies. Both hands are lifted a few inches with a slight jolt made bybending the wrists without moving the forearms. Then they are brought down withthe same jolt of the wrists (fig. 441).img445.png [images/img445.png]This magical pass engages the deep muscles of the abdomen. The same movementsare performed with the right hand in the lead. 19. Using the Hands Like a HatchetThe hands are clasped at the right. Both are lifted to the level of the shoulder(fig. 442).img446.png [images/img446.png] Then they deliver a diagonal strikethat takes them to the level of the left hip (fig. 443).img447.png[images/img447.png]The same movements are done on the left. 20. Hammering a Spike of EnergyThe hands are clasped at the right. They swing to the level of the shoulders,aided by a rotation of the trunk to the right. Making a small vertical circle infront of the right shoulder, the hands are brought to the division line betweenthe two bodies and down to the level of the waist as if to hammer a spike ofenergy there (fig. 444).img448.png [images/img448.png]The same movements are done on the left side. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Fifth Series: Third Group: The Magical Passes for Building Endurance21. Cutting Energy in an ArcThe hands are clasped on the right, fight against the crest of the hipbone. Theleft hand is on top of the right. The right elbow protrudes to the back, and theleft forearm is held against the stomach. In a powerful extended strike, theclasped hands slice in a horizontal arc across the area in front of the body asif going through a heavy substance. It's as if the hands were holding a knife,or a sword, or a cutting instrument that rips something solid in front of thebody (fig. 445).img449.png [images/img449.png] All the muscles of the arm, theabdomen, the chest, and the back are used. The muscles of the legs are tensed tolend stability to the movement. On the left side, the hands are pivoted. Theright hand is on top, in the lead, and another powerful cut takes place. 22. Slashing Energy with a Swordlike CutThe hands are clasped with the left hand on top of the right in front of theright shoulder (fig. 446).img450.png [images/img450.png] A powerful jolt of thewrists and the arms makes the hands move forward about a foot, delivering apowerful blow. From there, they cut across to a point on the left, at the levelof the shoulder. The end result is a movement that resembles cutting somethingheavy with a sword. From that point on the left, the arms change position byrotating, without losing their clasping position. The right hand takes the leadand gets on top, and again slashes across to a point about two feet away fromthe right shoulder (fig. 447).img451.png [images/img451.png]The initial position of the hands are changed, and the movements begin on theleft. 23. Slashing Energy with a Diagonal CutThe clasped hands are raised to the level of the right ear and pushed forward,as if to stab something solid located in front of the body (fig. 448).img452.png[images/img452.png] From there, they slash down to a place about a foot awayfrom the side of the left kneecap (fig. 449).img453.png [images/img453.png] Onthat point, the hands rotate at the wrists to change positions so that the righthand takes the lead on top. It is as if the cutting instrument that the handsseem to be holding is made to change directions before it slashes from left toright, following the contour of the knees (fig. 450).img454.png[images/img454.png] The hands change place, and the whole sequence is doneagain, starting from the left. 24. Carrying Energy from the Right Shoulder to the Left KneeThe clasped hands are held at waist level on the right. They change positionsslightly by the supporting right hand, which is on the bottom, becoming slightlymore vertical with a twist of the wrist, which is held by the pressure of theleft hand. The hands are quickly raised to a point by the top of the head, onthe right side (fig. 451).img455.png [images/img455.png] Leading with the elbow,they are brought down to shoulder level with great force. From there, they slashdown in a diagonal cut to a place about a foot away from the left side of thekneecap. The strike is aided by a quick downward turn of the wrists (fig.452).img456.png [images/img456.png]The hands pivot to change places, and the whole sequence is done again, startingfrom the left. 25. Slashing Energy by the KneesThe hands are clasped on the right side by the waist (fig. 453).img457.png[images/img457.png] They are brought in a powerful downward strike to the levelof the knees, as the trunk stoops forward slightly. Then they cut an arc infront of the knees from right to left, to a point four or five inches away fromthe left side of the kneecap (fig. 454).img458.png [images/img458.png] Then theclasped hands are brought back forcefully to a point a few inches to the rightof the right knee. The performance of both cutting strikes is aided by a verypowerful jolt of the wrists.The same movement is performed starting by the waist on the left. In order toperform this magical pass correctly, practitioners need to engage, rather thanthe muscles of the arms and the legs, the deep muscles of the abdomen. 26. The Digging Bar of EnergyThe clasped hands are held in front of the stomach, with the left hand on top asthe leading hand. They are shifted then to a vertical position in front of thestomach on the line that separates the two bodies. In a quick movement, they arebrought to a point above the head, as if still following the same line. Fromthere, they are made to strike down in a straight line to the place where themagical pass began (fig. 455).img459.png [images/img459.png] The hands changepositions, to have the right hand in the lead, and the movement is repeated. DonJuan called this movement stirring energy with a digging bar. 27. The Big SlashThe clasped hands start on the right, by the waist. They are quickly raisedabove the head, over the right shoulder (fig. 456).img460.png[images/img460.png] The wrists jolt back to gain strength, and a powerfuldiagonal strike is delivered that slashes Figure 455 energy in front of thebody, as if cutting through a sheet. The strike ends at a point four or fiveinches to the left of the left knee (fig. 457).img461.png [images/img461.png]The same movement is repeated starting from the left. 28. The SledgehammerWith the left hand in the lead, the hands are clasped together in front of thestomach on the vertical line that divides the left and the right bodies. Thepalms are held vertical for an instant before the hands are brought to the rightof the body and above the head to hang for another instant by the neck, as ifholding a heavy sledgehammer. They move over the head in a deliberate andpowerful swing (fig. 458)img462.png [images/img462.png] and are brought to bearon the spot from which they began to move, exactly as if the hands themselveswere a heavy sledgehammer (fig. 459).img463.png [images/img463.png] The handschange positions, and the same movements are started on the left. 29. Cutting a Circle of EnergyThe hands are clasped by the right shoulder to begin this magical pass (fig.460).img464.png [images/img464.png] Then they are pushed forward as far as theright arm can go without fully extending the elbow. From there, the claspedhands cut a circle the width of the body from right to left, as if they wereindeed holding a cutting instrument. In order to perform this movement, theleft, leading hand, which is on top, must reverse positions when it reaches theturn of the circle on the left; with the hands still clasped, they flip at theturn of the circle so that the right hand takes the lead by being on top (fig.461)img465.png [images/img465.png] and finishes drawing the circle.The same sequence of movements is performed, starting on the left, with theright hand in the lead. 30. The Back-and-Forth SlashThe hands are clasped on the right, with the left hand in the lead. A powerfulblow pushes the hands forward, about two feet away from the chest. Then, theyslash, as if they were holding a sword, as far to the left as the arms allowthem without completely extending the elbows (fig. 462).img466.png[images/img466.png] There, the hands change positions. The right hand becomesthe leading hand on top and a counterslash is performed, which takes the claspedhands all the way to a point on the right side, a few inches to the right ofwhere this magical pass started (fig. 463).img467.png [images/img467.png]The same sequence of movements is repeated, starting on the left, with the righthand in the lead. ================================================================ "},{"pageContent":"The Sixth Series: Devices Used in Conjunction with Specific Magical PassesAs previously stated, the shamans of ancient Mexico put a special emphasis on aforce they called tendon energy. Don Juan said that they asserted that vitalenergy moves along the body via an exclusive track formed by tendons.I asked don Juan if by tendon he meant the tissue that attaches the muscles tothe bones.\"I am at a loss to explain tendon energy,\" he said. \"I'm following the easy pathof usage. I was taught that it's called tendon energy. If I don't have to bespecific about it, you understand what tendon energy is, don't you?\"\"In a vague sense, I think I do, don Juan,\" I said. \"What confuses me is thatyou use the word tendon where there are no bones, such as the abdomen.\"\"The old sorcerers,\" he said, \"gave the name of tendon energy to a current ofenergy that moves along the deep muscles from the neck down to the chest andarms, and the spine. It cuts across the upper and lower abdomen from the edge ofthe rib cage to the groin, and from there it goes to the toes.\"\"Doesn't this current include the head, don Juan?\" I asked, bewildered. As aWestern man, I expected that anything of this sort would have originated in thebrain.\"No,\" he said emphatically, \"it doesn't include the head. What comes from thehead is a different kind of energetic current; not what I am talking about. Oneof the formidable attainments of sorcerers is that in the end, they push outwhatever exists in the center of energy located at the top of the head, and thenthey anchor the tendon energy of the rest of their bodies there. But that is aparagon of success. At the moment, what we have at hand, as in your case, is theaverage situation of tendon energy beginning at the neck at the place where itjoins the head. In some cases tendon energy goes up to a point below thecheekbones, but never higher than that point.\"This energy,\" he went on, \"which I call tendon energy for lack of a bettername, is a dire necessity in the lives of those who travel in infinity, or wantto travel in it.\"Don Juan said that the traditional beginning in the utilization of tendon energywas the use of some simple devices which were employed by the shamans of ancientMexico in two ways. One was to create a vibratory effect on specific centers oftendon energy, and the other was to create a pressure effect on the samecenters. He explained that those shamans considered the vibratory effect to bethe agent for loosening the energy which has become stagnant. The second effect,the pressure effect, was thought to be the agent that disperses the energy.What seems to be a cognitive contradiction for modern man - that vibration wouldloosen anything that was stuck, and that pressure would disperse it - was deeplyemphasized by don Juan Matus, who taught his disciples that what appears to benatural to us in terms of our cognition in the world is not at all natural interms of the flow of energy. He said that in the world of everyday life, humanbeings would crack something with a blow, or by applying pressure, and disperseit by making it vibrate. However, energy which had become lodged in a tendoncenter had to be rendered fluid through vibration, and then it had to bepressed, so that it would continue flowing. Don Juan Matus was horrified at theidea of directly pressing points of energy in the body without the preliminaryvibration. His contention was that energy that was stuck would get even moreinert if pressure were applied to it.Don Juan started off his disciples with two basic devices. He explained that theshamans of ancient times used to search for a pair of round pebbles or dry roundseed pods, and use them as vibratory and pressure devices to aid in manipulatingthe flow of energy in the body, which they believed becomes periodically stuckalong the tendon track.However, the round pebbles that shaman practitioners normally used weredefinitely too hard, and the seed pods too fragile. Other objects that thoseshamans searched for avidly were flat rocks the size of the hand or pieces ofheavy wood, in order to place them on specific areas of tendon energy on theirabdomens while they were lying flat on their backs. The first area is just belowthe navel; another is right on top of the navel, and another yet, on the area ofthe solar plexus. The problem with using rocks or other objects is that theyhave to be heated or cooled to approximate the temperature of the body, andbesides, these objects are usually too stiff, and they slide and move around.Tensegrity practitioners have found a much better equivalent to the devices ofthe shamans of ancient Mexico: a pair of round balls and a small, flat, circularleather weight. The balls are the same size as the ones used by those shamans,but they are not fragile at all; they are made of a mixture of Teflon reinforcedby a ceramic compound. This mixture gives the balls a weight, a hardness, and asmoothness which are thoroughly congruous with the purpose of the magicalpasses.The other device, the leather weight, has been found to be an ideal device forcreating a steady pressure on centers of tendon energy. Unlike rocks, it ispliable enough to adapt itself to the contours of the body. Its leather covermakes it possible to be applied directly to the body without needing to bewarmed or cooled. However, its most remarkable feature is its weight. It islight enough not to cause any discomfort, and yet heavy enough to aid somespecific magical passes that foster inner silence by pressing centers on theabdomen. Don Juan Matus said that a weight placed on any of the three areasmentioned above engages the totality of one's energy fields, which means amomentary shutting off of the internal dialogue: the first step toward innersilence.The modern devices used in conjunction with specific magical passes are dividedby their very nature into two categories. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Sixth Series: First CategoryThis first category of magical passes that use the help of a device consists ofsixteen magical passes aided by the Teflon balls. Eight of these magical passesare performed on the left arm and wrist, and eight on the points of the liverand gallbladder, the pancreas and spleen, the bridge of the nose, the temples,and the crown of the head. The sorcerers of ancient Mexico considered the firsteight magical passes to be the first step toward the liberation of the left bodyfrom the unwarranted dominion of the right body.1. The first movement pertains to the outer side of the main tendon of thebiceps of the left arm. A ball is applied to that hollow spot and made tovibrate by moving it back and forth with a slight pressure (figs. 464,465).img468.png [images/img468.png]img469.png [images/img469.png]2. In the second movement, a ball is held in the hollow palm of the right hand,with the thumb holding it securely (fig. 466).img470.png [images/img470.png] Afirm but light pressure is applied to the ball, which is made to rub from theleft wrist to a point one hand's width away from the wrist (fig. 467).img471.png[images/img471.png] The ball is rubbed back and forth in the canal created bythe tendons of the wrist (fig. 468).img472.png [images/img472.png]3. The ball is lightly pressed at a point on the left forearm a hand's widthaway from the wrist (figs. 469, 470).img473.png [images/img473.png]img474.png[images/img474.png]4. A moderate pressure is applied at the wrist of the left arm with the indexfinger of the right hand on a spot next to the head of the forearm bone (fig.471).img475.png [images/img475.png] The right thumb anchors the hand on theinside of the wrist (fig. 472)img476.png [images/img476.png] and moves the handback and forth (figs. 473, 474).img477.png [images/img477.png]img478.png[images/img478.png]5. The ball is applied to the inner side of the tendon of the left biceps, andit is made to vibrate with a slight pressure (figs. 475, 476).img479.png[images/img479.png]img480.png [images/img480.png]6. A vibration is applied to the hollow spot at the back of the elbow to theleft of the elbow proper. The palm of the left hand is twisted and turnedoutward to allow maximum opening of that area (fig. 477).img481.png[images/img481.png] The ball is rubbed there.7. Moderate pressure is applied to a spot in the middle of the upper left arm,on the hollow spot where the triceps joins the bone (figs. 478, 479).img482.png[images/img482.png]img483.png [images/img483.png]8. The left elbow is bent sharply and is rolled forward, engaging the leftshoulder blade, to disperse tendon energy to the whole left body (fig.480).img484.png [images/img484.png] The remaining eight magical passes of this first category pertain to the upperbody and three centers of energy: the gallbladder and liver, the pancreas andspleen, and the head.9. The balls are held with both hands, pressed and pushed deeply upward, butwith only slight pressure, just under, the sides of the rib cage by the liverand the pancreas (fig. 481).img485.png [images/img485.png] Then they are made tovibrate firmly but lightly on those areas.10. The ball held with the right hand is applied then with a slight pressure tothe area just above the sinus, between the eyebrows, and is made to vibratethere (fig. 482).img486.png [images/img486.png]11. Both balls are applied to the temples and made to vibrate lightly (fig.483).img487.png [images/img487.png]12. The ball held with the right hand is applied to the very top of the head andis made to vibrate there (fig. 484).img488.png [images/img488.png]13-16. The same sequence is repeated, but instead of being made to vibrate, theballs are pressed against those centers of energy. During this second set ofmovements, both balls are pressed on the sides of the rib cage, by the liver andthe pancreas. Then the ball held with the left hand is pressed on the area abovethe sinus. Both balls are pressed on the temples, and then the ball held withthe left hand is pressed on the top of the head. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Sixth Series: Second CategoryThe second category comprises the uses of the leather weight for the purpose ofcreating a steady pressure on a larger area of tendon energy. There are twomagical passes used in conjunction with the leather weight.The hand positions for both of these magical passes are shown here with thepractitioner standing. The actual practice of these magical passes is performedlying flat on the back with the leather weight pressing right above the navel oron either of the other two choice spots on the abdomen: below the navel, orabove it by the solar plexus, if placing the weight on them is more comfortable. 17. The Five Points of Silence Around the ChestThe little fingers of both hands are placed on the edges of the rib cage abouttwo inches from the tip of the sternum, and the thumbs are extended as far up onthe chest as possible. The remaining three fingers fall evenly spread in thespace between the thumb and the little finger. A vibratory pressure is exertedwith all five fingers of each hand (fig. 485).img489.png [images/img489.png] 18. Pressing the Midpoint Between the Rib Cage and the Crest of the HipboneThe little finger and the fourth finger of each hand rest on the crests of thehips while the thumbs rest on the lower edge of the rib cage on each side.Slight pressure is applied on those two points. The index and middle fingersautomatically press points midway between the crests of the hips and the edge ofthe rib cage (fig. 486).img490.png [images/img490.png] ### Magical Passes - Copyright 1998 by CARLOS CASTANEDA - The End ###"}]
