Due to the foreignness of theconcepts and practices don Juan wanted me to understand and internalize, I havehad no other choice but to render his teachings in the form of a narrative; anarrative of what happened, as it happened.The organization of don Juan's instruction was predicated on the idea that manhas two types of awareness. He labeled them the right side and the left side. Hedescribed the first as the state of normal awareness necessary for everydaylife. The second, he said, was the mysterious side of man; the state ofawareness needed to function as sorcerer and seer. Don Juan divided hisinstruction, accordingly, into teachings for the right side and teachings forthe left side.He conducted his teachings for the right side when I was in my state of normalawareness, and I have described those teachings in all my accounts. In my stateof normal awareness don Juan told me that he was a sorcerer. He even introducedme to don Genaro Flores, whom he also led me to believe was another sorcerer.Because of the nature of our association, I logically concluded that they hadtaken me as their sorcerers' apprentice.That apprenticeship ended with an incomprehensible act that both don Juan anddon Genaro led me to perform. They had me jump from the top of a flat mountaininto an abyss.I have described in one of my accounts what took place on that mountaintop. Thelast drama of don Juan's teachings for the right side was played there by donJuan himself; don Genaro; two apprentices, Pablito and Nestor; and me. Pablito,Nestor, and I jumped from that mountaintop into an abyss.For years afterward I thought that just my total trust in don Juan and donGenaro had been sufficient to obliterate all my rational fears on facing actualannihilation. I know now that it wasn't so; I know that the secret was in donJuan's teachings for the left side, and that it took tremendous discipline andperseverance for don Juan, don Genaro, and their companions to conduct thoseteachings.It has taken me nearly ten years to recollect what exactly took place in histeachings for the left side that led me to be so willing to perform such anincomprehensible act as jumping into an abyss.It was in his teachings for the left side that don Juan let on what he, donGenaro, and their companions were really doing to me and who they were. Theywere not teaching me sorcery, but how to master three aspects of an ancientknowledge they possessed: awareness, stalking, and intent. And they were notsorcerers; they were seers. And don Juan was not only a seer, but also a nagual.Don Juan had already explained to me, in his teachings for the right side, agreat deal about the nagual and about seeing. I had understood seeing to be thecapacity of human beings to enlarge their perceptual field until they arecapable of assessing, not only the outer appearances, but the essence ofeverything. He had also explained that seers see man as a field of energy whichlooks like a luminous egg. The majority of people, he said, have their fields ofenergy divided into two parts. A few men and women have four or sometimes threeparts. Because these people are more resilient than the average man, they canbecome naguals after learning to see.In his teachings for the left side, don Juan explained to me the intricacies ofseeing and of being a nagual. To be a nagual, he said, is something more complexand far-reaching than being merely a more resilient man who has learned to see.To be a nagual entails being a leader, being a teacher and a guide.As a nagual, don Juan was the leader of a group of seers known as the nagual'sparty, which was composed of eight female seers: Cecilia, Delia, Hermelinda,Carmela, Nelida, Florinda, Zuleica, and Zoila; three male seers: Vicente, SilvioManuel, and Genaro; and four couriers or messengers: Emilito, John Tuma, Marta,and Teresa.In addition to leading the nagual's party, don Juan also taught and guided agroup of apprentice seers known as the new nagual's party. It consisted of fouryoung men: Pablito, Nestor, Eligio, and Benigno; along with five women: Soledad,la Gorda, Lidia, Josefina, and Rosa. I was the nominal leader of the newnagual's party together with the nagual woman Carol.In order for don Juan to impart to me his teachings for the left side, it wasnecessary for me to enter into a unique state of perceptual clarity known asheightened awareness. Throughout the years of my association with him, he had merepeatedly shift into such a state by means of a blow that he delivered with thepalm of his hand on my upper back.Don Juan explained that in a state of heightened awareness apprentices canbehave almost as naturally as in everyday life, but can bring their minds tofocus on anything with uncommon force and clarity. Yet, an inherent quality ofheightened awareness is that it is not susceptible to normal recall. Whattranspires in such a state becomes part of the apprentice's everyday awarenessonly through a staggering effort of recovery.My interaction with the nagual's party was an example of this difficulty ofrecall. With the exception of don Genaro, I had contact with them only when Iwas in a state of heightened awareness. Hence, in my normal everyday life Icould not remember them; not even as vague characters in dreams. The manner inwhich I met with them every time was almost a ritual. I would drive to donGenaro's house in a small town in the southern part of Mexico. Don Juan wouldjoin us immediately and the three of us would then get busy with don Juan'steachings for the right side. After that, don Juan would make me change levelsof awareness and then we would drive to a larger, nearby town where he and theother fifteen seers were living.Every time I entered into heightened awareness I could not cease marveling atthe difference between my two sides. I always felt as if a veil had been liftedfrom my eyes; as if I had been partially blind before and now I could see. Thefreedom, the sheer joy that used to possess me on those occasions cannot becompared with anything else I have ever experienced. Yet at the same time, therewas a frightening feeling of sadness and longing that went hand in hand withthat freedom and joy. Don Juan had told me that there is no completeness withoutsadness and longing, for without them there is no sobriety, no kindness. Wisdomwithout kindness, he said, and knowledge without sobriety are useless.The organization of his teachings for the left side also required that don Juan,together with some of his fellow seers, explain to me the three facets of theirknowledge: the mastery of awareness, the mastery of stalking, and the mastery ofintent.This work deals with the mastery of awareness, which is part of his total set ofteachings for the left side; the set he used in order to prepare me forperforming the astonishing act of jumping into an abyss.Due to the fact that the experiences I narrate here took place in heightenedawareness, they cannot have the texture of daily life. They are lacking inworldly context, although I have tried my best to supply it withoutfictionalizing it. In heightened awareness one is minimally conscious of thesurroundings, because one's total concentration is taken by the details of theaction at hand.In this case the action at hand was, naturally, the elucidation [* elucidation-an act of explaining that serves to clear up and cast light on] of the masteryof awareness. Don Juan understood the mastery of awareness as being themodern-day version of an extremely old tradition, which he called the traditionof the ancient Toltec seers.Although he felt that he was inextricably linked to that old tradition, heconsidered himself to be one of the seers of a new cycle. When I asked him oncewhat the essential character of the seers of the new cycle was, he said thatthey are the warriors of total freedom; that they are such masters of awareness,stalking, and intent that they are not caught by death like the rest of mortalmen; but choose the moment and the way of their departure from this world. Atthat moment they are consumed by a fire from within and vanish from the face ofthe earth, free, as if they had never existed.==============================================================="},{"pageContent":"1. The New SeersI had arrived in the city of Oaxaca in southern Mexico on my way to themountains to look for don Juan. On my way out of town in the early morning, Ihad the good sense to drive by the main square, and there I found him sitting onhis favorite bench, as if waiting for me to go by.I joined him. He told me that he was in the city on business, that he wasstaying at a local boardinghouse, and that I was welcome to stay with himbecause he had to remain in town for two more days. We talked for a while aboutmy activities and problems in the academic world.As was customary with him, he suddenly hit me on my back when I least expectedit, and the blow shifted me into a state of heightened awareness.We sat in silence for a very long time. I anxiously waited for him to begintalking, yet when he did, he caught me by surprise.\"Ages before the Spaniards came to Mexico,\" he said, \"there were extraordinaryToltec seers, men capable of inconceivable deeds. They were the last link in achain of knowledge that extended over thousands of years.\"The Toltec seers were extraordinary men- powerful sorcerers, somber, driven menwho unraveled mysteries and possessed secret knowledge that they used toinfluence and victimize people by fixating the awareness of their victims onwhatever they chose.\"He stopped talking and looked at me intently. I felt that he was waiting for meto ask a question, but I did not know what to ask.\"I have to emphasize an important fact,\" he continued, \"the fact that thosesorcerers knew how to fixate the awareness of their victims. You didn't pick upon that. When I mentioned it, it didn't mean anything to you. That's notsurprising. One of the hardest things to acknowledge is that awareness can bemanipulated.\"I felt confused. I knew that he was leading me toward something. I felt afamiliar apprehension; the same feeling I had whenever he began a new round ofhis teachings.I told him how I felt. He smiled vaguely. Usually when he smiled he exudedhappiness. This time he was definitely preoccupied. He seemed to consider for amoment whether or not to go on talking. He stared at me intently again, slowlymoving his gaze over the entire length of my body. Then, apparently satisfied,he nodded and said that I was ready for my final exercise, something that allwarriors go through before considering themselves fit to be on their own. I wasmore mystified than ever.\"We are going to be talking about awareness,\" he continued. \"The Toltec seersknew the art of handling awareness. As a matter of fact, they were the suprememasters of that art. When I say that they knew how to fixate the awareness oftheir victims, I mean that their secret knowledge and secret practices allowedthem to pry open the mystery of being aware. Enough of their practices havesurvived to this day, but fortunately in a modified form. I say fortunatelybecause those activities, as I will explain, did not lead the ancient Toltecseers to freedom, but to their doom.\"\"Do you know those practices yourself?\" I asked.\"Why, certainly,\" he replied. \"There is no way for us not to know thosetechniques, but that doesn't mean that we practice them ourselves. We have otherviews. We belong to a new cycle.\"\"But you don't consider yourself a sorcerer, don Juan, do you?\" I asked.\"No, I don't,\" he said. \"I am a warrior who sees. In fact, all of us are losnuevos videntes- the new seers. The old seers were the sorcerers.\"For the average man,\" he continued, \"sorcery is a negative business, but it isfascinating all the same. That's why I encouraged you, in your normal awareness,to think of us as sorcerers. It's advisable to do so. It serves to attractinterest. But for us to be sorcerers would be like entering a dead-end street.\"I wanted to know what he meant by that, but he refused to talk about it. He saidthat he would elaborate on the subject as he proceeded with his explanation ofawareness.I asked him then about the origin of the Toltecs' knowledge.\"The way the Toltecs first started on the path of knowledge was by eating powerplants,\" he replied. \"Whether prompted by curiosity, or hunger, or error, theyate them. Once the power plants had produced their effects on them, it was onlya matter of time before some of them began to analyze their experiences. In myopinion, the first men on the path of knowledge were very daring, but verymistaken.\"\"Isn't all this a conjecture [* conjecture- a hypothesis that has been formed byspeculating based on incomplete evidence] on your part, don Juan?\"\"No, this is no conjecture of mine. I am a seer, and when I focus my seeing onthat time I know everything that took place.\"\"Can you see the details of things of the past?\" I asked.\"Seeing is a peculiar feeling of knowing,\" he replied, \"of knowing somethingwithout a shadow of doubt. In this case, I know what those men did, not onlybecause of my seeing, but because we are so closely bound together.\"Don Juan explained then that his use of the term 'Toltec' did not correspond towhat I understood it to mean. To me it meant a culture, the Toltec Empire. Tohim, the term Toltec meant 'man of knowledge'.He said that in the time he was referring to, centuries or perhaps evenmillennia before the Spanish Conquest, all such men of knowledge lived within avast geographical area, north and south of the valley of Mexico, and wereemployed in specific lines of work: curing, bewitching, storytelling, dancing,being an oracle, preparing food and drink. Those lines of work fostered specificwisdom, wisdom that distinguished them from average men. These Toltecs,moreover, were also people who fitted into the structure of everyday life, verymuch as doctors, artists, teachers, priests, and merchants in our own time do.They practiced their professions under the strict control of organizedbrotherhoods and became proficient and influential to such an extent that theyeven dominated groups of people who lived outside the Toltecs' geographicalregions.Don Juan said that after centuries of dealing with power plants, some of thesemen had finally learned to see. The most enterprising of them then began toteach other men of knowledge how to see. And that was the beginning of theirend. As time passed, the number of seers increased, but their obsession withwhat they saw, which filled them with reverence and fear, became so intense thatthey ceased to be men of knowledge. They became extraordinarily proficient inseeing and could exert great control over the strange worlds they werewitnessing. But it was to no avail. Seeing had undermined their strength andforced them to be obsessed with what they saw.\"There were seers, however, who escaped that fate,\" don Juan continued, \"greatmen who, in spite of their seeing, never ceased to be men of knowledge. Some ofthem endeavored to use seeing positively, and to teach it to their fellow men.I'm convinced that under their direction, the populations of entire cities wentinto other worlds and never came back.\"But the seers who could only see were fiascos, and when the land where theylived was invaded by a conquering people, they were as defenseless as everyoneelse.\"Those conquerors,\" he went on, \"took over the Toltec world. They appropriatedeverything, but they never learned to see.\"'\"Why do you think they never learned to see?\" I asked.\"Because they copied the procedures of the Toltec seers without having theToltecs' inner knowledge. To this day there are scores of sorcerers all overMexico, descendants of those conquerors, who follow the Toltec ways but don'tknow what they're doing, or what they're talking about, because they're notseers.\"\"Who were those conquerors, don Juan?\"\"Other Indians,\" he said. \"When the Spaniards came, the old seers had been gonefor centuries, but there was a new breed of seers who were starting to securetheir place in a new cycle.\"\"What do you mean. a new breed of seers?\"\"After the world of the first Toltecs was destroyed, the surviving seersretreated and began a serious examination of their practices. The first thingthey did was to establish stalking, dreaming, and intent as the key procedures;and to deemphasize the use of power plants; perhaps that gives us a hint as towhat really happened to them with power plants.\"The new cycle was just beginning to take hold when the Spanish conquerors sweptthe land. Fortunately, by that time the new seers were thoroughly prepared toface that danger. They were already consummate practitioners of the art ofstalking.\"Don Juan said that the subsequent centuries of subjugation provided for thesenew seers the ideal circumstances in which to perfect their skills. Oddlyenough, it was the extreme rigor and coercion of that period that gave them theimpetus to refine their new principles. And, owing to the fact that they neverdivulged their activities, they were left alone to map their findings.\"Were there a great many new seers during the Conquest?\" I asked.\"At the beginning there were. Near the end there were only a handful. The resthad been exterminated.\"\"What about in our day, don Juan?\" I asked.\"There are a few. They are scattered all over, you understand.\"\"Do you know them?\" I asked.\"Such a simple question is the hardest one to answer,\" he replied. \"There aresome we know very well. But they are not exactly like us because they haveconcentrated on other specific aspects of knowledge, such as dancing, curing,bewitching, or talking; instead of what the new seers recommend- stalking,dreaming, and intent. Those who are exactly like us would not cross our path.The seers who lived during the Conquest set it up that way so as to avoid beingexterminated in the confrontation with the Spaniards. Each of those seersfounded a lineage. And not all of them had descendants, so the lines are few.\"\"Do you know any who are exactly like us?\" I asked.\"A few,\" he replied laconically.I asked him then to give me all the information he could, for I was vitallyinterested in the topic. To me it was of crucial importance to know names andaddresses for purposes of validation and corroboration.Don Juan did not seem inclined to oblige me.\"The new seers went through that bit of corroboration,\" he said. \"Half of themleft their bones in the corroborating room. So now they are solitary birds.Let's leave it that way. All we can talk about is our line. About that, you andI can say as much as we please.\"He explained that all the lines of seers were started at the same time and inthe same fashion. Around the end of the sixteenth century every nagualdeliberately isolated himself and his group of seers from any overt contact withother seers. The consequence of that drastic segregation, he said, was theformation of the individual lineages. Our lineage consisted of fourteen nagualsand one hundred and twenty-six seers, he said. Some of those fourteen nagualshad as few as seven seers with them. others had eleven, and some up to fifteen.He told me that his teacher- or his benefactor, as he called him- was the nagualJulian, and the one who came before Julian was the nagual Ellas. I asked him ifhe knew the names of all fourteen naguals. He named and enumerated them for meso I could learn who they were. He also said that he had personally known thefifteen seers who formed his benefactor's group and that he had also known hisbenefactor's teacher, the nagual Elias, and the eleven seers of his party.Don Juan assured me that our line was quite exceptional because it underwent adrastic change in the year 1723 as a result of an outside influence that came tobear on us and inexorably altered our course. He did not want to discuss theevent itself at the moment, but he said that a new beginning is counted fromthat time; and that the eight naguals who have ruled the line since then areconsidered intrinsically different from the six who preceded them.Don Juan must have had business to take care of the next day, for I did not seehim until around noon. In the meantime, three of his apprentices had come totown, Pablito, Nestor, and la Gorda. They were shopping for tools and materialsfor Pablito's carpentry business. I accompanied them and helped them to completeall their errands. Then all of us went back to the boardinghouse.All four of us were sitting around talking when don Juan came into my room. Heannounced that we were leaving after lunch, but that before we went to eat hestill had something to discuss with me in private. He wanted the two of us totake a stroll around the main square and then all of us would meet at arestaurant.Pablito and Nestor stood up and said that they had some errands to run beforemeeting us. La Gorda seemed very displeased.\"What are you going to talk about?\" she blurted out, but quickly realized hermistake and giggled.Don Juan gave her a strange look but did not say anything.Encouraged by his silence, la Gorda proposed that we take her along. She assuredus that she would not bother us in the least.\"I'm sure you won't bother us,\" don Juan said to her, \"but I really don't wantyou to hear anything of what I have to say to him.\"La Gorda's anger was very obvious. She blushed, and as don Juan and I walked outof the room her entire face clouded with anxiety and tension; becoming instantlydistorted. Her mouth was open and her lips were dry.La Gorda's mood made me very apprehensive. I felt an actual discomfort. I didn'tsay anything, but don Juan seemed to notice my feelings.\"You should thank la Gorda day and night,\" he said all of a sudden. \"She'shelping you destroy your self-importance. She's the petty tyrant in your life,but you still haven't caught on to that.\"We strolled around the plaza until all my nervousness had vanished. Then we satdown on his favorite bench again.\"The ancient seers were very fortunate indeed,\" don Juan began, \"because theyhad plenty of time to learn marvelous things. Let me tell you, they knew wondersthat we can't even imagine today.\"\"Who taught them all that?\" I asked.\"They learned everything by themselves through seeing,\" he replied. \"Most of thethings we know in our lineage were figured out by them. The new seers correctedthe mistakes of the old seers, but the basis of what we know and do is lost inToltec time.\"He explained. One of the simplest and yet most important findings from the pointof view of instruction, he said, is the knowledge that man has two types ofawareness. The old seers called them the right and the left side of man.\"The old seers figured out,\" he went on, \"that the best way to teach theirknowledge was to make their apprentices shift to their left side to a state ofheightened awareness. Real learning takes place there.\"Very young children were given to the old seers as apprentices,\" don Juancontinued, \"so that they wouldn't know any other way of life. Those children, inturn, when they came of age, took other children as apprentices. Imagine thethings they must have uncovered in their shifts to the left and to the rightafter centuries of that kind of concentration.\"I remarked how disconcerting those shifts were to me. He said that my experiencewas similar to his own. His benefactor, the nagual Julian, had created aprofound schism [* schism- division into opposing factions] in him, by makinghim shift back and forth from one type of awareness to the other. He said thatthe clarity and freedom he experienced in heightened awareness were in totalcontrast to the rationalizations, the defenses, the anger, and the fear of hisnormal state of awareness.The old seers used to create this polarity to suit their own particularpurposes; with it, they forced their apprentices to achieve the concentrationneeded to learn sorcery techniques. But the new seers, he said, use it to leadtheir apprentices to the conviction that there are unrealized possibilities inman.\"The best effort of the new seers,\" don Juan continued, \"is their explanation ofthe mystery of awareness. They condensed it all into some concepts and actionswhich are taught while the apprentices are in heightened awareness.\"He said that the value of the new seers' method of teaching is that it takesadvantage of the fact that no one can remember anything that happens while beingin a state of heightened awareness. This inability to remember sets up an almostinsurmountable barrier for warriors who have to recollect all the instructiongiven to them if they are to go on. Only after years of struggle and disciplinecan warriors recollect their instruction. By then the concepts and theprocedures that were taught to them have been internalized, and have thusacquired the force the new seers meant them to have. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"2. Petty TyrantsDon Juan did not discuss the mastery of awareness with me until months later. Wewere at that time in the house where the nagual's party lived.\"Let's go for a walk,\" don Juan said to me, placing his hand on my shoulder. \"Orbetter yet, let's go to the town's square, where there are a lot of people, andsit down and talk.\"I was surprised when he spoke to me, as I had been in the house for a couple ofdays by then and he had not said so much as \"hello\".As don Juan and I were leaving the house, la Gorda intercepted us, and demandedthat we take her along. She seemed determined not to take no for an answer. DonJuan in a very stern voice told her that he had to discuss something in privatewith me.\"You're going to talk about me,\" la Gorda said, her tone and gestures betrayingboth suspicion and annoyance.\"You're right,\" don Juan replied dryly. He moved past her without turning tolook at her.I followed him, and we walked in silence to the town's square. When we sat downI asked him what on earth we would find to discuss about la Gorda. I was stillsmarting from her look of menace when we left the house.\"We have nothing to discuss about la Gorda or anybody else,\" he said. \"I toldher that just to provoke her enormous self-importance. And it worked. She isfurious with us. If I know her, by now she will have talked to herself longenough to have built up her confidence and her righteous indignation at havingbeen refused and made to look like a fool. I wouldn't be surprised if she bargesin on us here at the park bench.\"\"If we're not going to talk about la Gorda, what are we going to discuss?\" Iasked.\"We're going to continue the discussion we started in Oaxaca,\" he replied. \"Tounderstand the explanation of awareness will require your utmost effort and yourwillingness to shift back and forth between levels of awareness. While we areinvolved in our discussion, I will demand your total concentration andpatience.\"Half-complaining, I told him that he had made me feel very uncomfortable byrefusing to talk to me for the past two days. He looked at me and arched hisbrows. A smile played on his lips and vanished. I realized that he was lettingme know I was no better than la Gorda.\"I was provoking your self-importance,\" he said with a frown. \"Self-importanceis our greatest enemy. Think about it. What weakens us is feeling offended bythe deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance requires that wespend most of our lives offended by someone.\"The new seers recommended that every effort should be made to eradicateself-importance from the lives of warriors. I have followed that recommendation,and much of my endeavors with you has been geared to show you that withoutself-importance we are invulnerable.\"As I listened, his eyes suddenly became very shiny. I was thinking to myselfthat he seemed to be on the verge of laughter, and there was no reason for it,when I was startled by an abrupt, painful slap on the right side of my face.I jumped up from the bench. La Gorda was standing behind me, her hand stillraised. Her face was flushed with anger.\"Now you can say what you like about me and with more justification,\" sheshouted. \"If you have anything to say, however, say it to my face!\"Her outburst appeared to have exhausted her because she sat down on the cementand began to weep. Don Juan was transfixed with inexpressible glee. I was frozenwith sheer fury. La Gorda glared at me, and then turned to don Juan and meeklytold him that we had no right to criticize her.Don Juan laughed so hard he doubled over almost to the ground. He couldn't evenspeak. He tried two or three times to say something to me, then finally got upand walked away; his body still shaking with spasms of laughter.I was about to run after him, still glowering at la Gorda- at that moment Ifound her despicable- when something extraordinary happened to me. I realizedwhat don Juan had found so hilarious. La Gorda and I were horrendously alike.Our self-importance was monumental. My surprise and fury at being slapped werejust like la Gorda's feelings of anger and suspicion. Don Juan was right. Theburden of self-importance is a terrible encumbrance.I ran after him then, elated, the tears flowing down my cheeks. I caught up withhim and told him what I had realized. His eyes were shining with mischievousnessand delight.\"What should I do about la Gorda?\" I asked.\"Nothing,\" he replied. \"Realizations are always personal.\"He changed the subject and said that the omens were telling us to continue ourdiscussion back at his house, either in a large room with comfortable chairs, orin the back patio which had a roofed corridor around it. He said that wheneverhe conducted his explanation inside the house, those two areas would be offlimits to everyone else.We went back to the house. Don Juan told everyone what la Gorda had done. Thedelight all the seers showed in taunting her made la Gorda's position extremelyuncomfortable.\"Self-importance can't be fought with niceties,\" don Juan commented when Iexpressed my concern about la Gorda.He then asked everyone to leave the room. We sat down and don Juan began hisexplanations.He said that seers, old and new, are divided into two categories. The first oneis made up of those who are willing to exercise self-restraint and can channeltheir activities toward pragmatic goals which would benefit other seers and manin general. The other category consists of those who don't care aboutself-re-straint or about any pragmatic goals. It is the consensus among seersthat the latter have failed to resolve the problem of self-importance.\"Self-importance is not something simple and naive,\" he explained. \"On the onehand, it is the core of everything that is good in us; and on the other hand,the core of everything that is rotten. To get rid of the self-importance that isrotten requires a masterpiece of strategy. Seers through the ages have given thehighest praise to those who have accomplished it.\"I complained that the idea of eradicating self-importance, although veryappealing to me at times, was really incomprehensible. I told him that I foundhis directives for getting rid of it so vague I could not follow them.\"I've said to you many times,\" he said, \"that in order to follow the path ofknowledge, one has to be very imaginative. You see, in the path of knowledgenothing is as clear as we'd like it to be.\"My discomfort made me argue that his admonitions about self-importance remindedme of Catholic postulates. [* postulates- propositions that are accepted as truein order to provide a basis for logical reasoning] After a lifetime of beingtold about the evils of sin, I had become callous.\"Warriors fight self-importance as a matter of strategy, not principle,\" hereplied. \"Your mistake is to understand what I say in terms of morality.\"\"I see you as a highly moral man, don Juan,\" I insisted.\"You've noticed my impeccability, that's all,\" he said.\"Impeccability, as well as getting rid of self-importance, is too vague aconcept to be of any value to me,\" I remarked.Don Juan choked with laughter, and I challenged him to explain impeccability.\"Impeccability is nothing else but the proper use of energy,\" he said. \"Mystatements have no inkling of morality. I've saved energy and that makes meimpeccable. To understand this, you have to save enough energy yourself.\"We were quiet for a long time. I wanted to think about what he had said.Suddenly, he started talking again.\"Warriors take strategic inventories,\" he said. \"They list everything they do.Then they decide which of those things can be changed in order to allowthemselves a respite in terms of expending their energy.\"I argued that their list would have to include everything under the sun. Hepatiently answered that the strategic inventory he was talking about coveredonly behavioral patterns that were not essential to our survival and well-being.I jumped at the opportunity to point out that survival and well-being werecategories that could be interpreted in endless ways, hence, there was no way ofagreeing what was or was not essential to survival and well-being.As I kept on talking I began to lose momentum. Finally, I stopped because Irealized the futility of my arguments.Don Juan said then that in the strategic inventories of warriors,self-importance figures as the activity that consumes the greatest amount ofenergy, hence, their effort to eradicate it.\"One of the first concerns of warriors is to free that energy in order to facethe unknown with it,\" don Juan went on. \"The action of rechanneling that energyis impeccability.\"He said that the most effective strategy was worked out by the seers of theConquest- the unquestionable masters of stalking. It consists of six elementsthat interplay with one another. Five of them are called the attributes ofwarriorship: control, discipline, forbearance, timing, and will. They pertain tothe world of the warrior who is fighting to lose self-importance. The sixthelement, which is perhaps the most important of all, pertains to the outsideworld and is called the petty tyrant.He looked at me as if silently asking me whether or not I had understood.\"I'm really mystified,\" I said. \"You keep on saying that la Gorda is the pettytyrant of my life. Just what is a petty tyrant?\"\"A petty tyrant is a tormentor,\" he replied. \"Someone who either holds the powerof life and death over warriors, or simply annoys them to distraction.\"Don Juan had a beaming smile as he spoke to me. He said that the new seersdeveloped their own classification of petty tyrants. Although the concept is oneof their most serious and important findings, the new seers had a sense of humorabout it. He assured me that there was a tinge of malicious humor in every oneof their classifications because humor was the only means of counteracting thecompulsion of human awareness to take inventories and to make cumbersomeclassifications.The new seers, in accordance with their practice, saw fit to head theirclassification with the primal source of energy- the one and only ruler in theuniverse- and they called it simply 'the tyrant'. The rest of the despots andauthoritarians were found to be, naturally, infinitely below the category of thetyrant. Compared to the source of everything, the most fearsome and tyrannicalmen are buffoons. Consequently, they were classified as petty tyrants, pinchestiranos.He said that there were two subclasses of minor petty tyrants. The firstsubclass consisted of the petty tyrants who persecute and inflict misery butwithout actually causing anybody's death. They were called little petty tyrants,pinches tiranitos. The second consisted of the petty tyrants who are onlyexasperating and bothersome to no end. They were called small-fry petty tyrants,repinches tiranitos, or teensy-weensy petty tyrants, pinches tiranitoschiquititos.I thought his classifications were ludicrous. I was sure that he was improvisingthe Spanish terms. I asked him if that was so.\"Not at all,\" he replied with an amused expression. \"The new seers were greatones for classifications. Genaro is doubtless one of the greatest. If you'dobserve him carefully, you'd realize exactly how the new seers feel about theirclassifications.\"He laughed uproariously at my confusion when I asked him if he was pulling myleg.\"I wouldn't dream of doing that,\" he said, smiling. \"Genaro may do that, but notI, especially when I know how you feel about classifications. It's just that thenew seers were terribly irreverent.\"He added that the little petty tyrants are further divided into four categories:one that torments with brutality and violence, another that does it by creatingunbearable apprehension through deviousness, another which oppresses withsadness, and the last which torments by making warriors rage.\"La Gorda is in a class of her own,\" he added. \"She is an acting, small-frypetty tyrant. She annoys you to pieces and makes you rage. She even slaps you.With all that she is teaching you detachment.\"\"That's not possible!\" I protested.\"You haven't yet put together all the ingredients of the new seers' strategy,\"he said. \"Once you do that, you'll know how efficient and clever is the deviceof using a petty tyrant. I would certainly say that the strategy not only getsrid of self-importance, it also prepares warriors for the final realization thatimpeccability is the only thing that counts in the path of knowledge.\"He said that what the new seers had in mind was a deadly maneuver in which thepetty tyrant is like a mountain peak and the attributes of warriorship are likeclimbers who meet at the summit.\"Usually, only four attributes are played,\" he went on. \"The fifth, will, isalways saved for an ultimate confrontation when warriors are facing the firingsquad, so to speak.\"\"Why is it done that way?\"\"Because will belongs to another sphere, the 'unknown'. The other four belong tothe 'known'; which is exactly where the petty tyrants are lodged. In fact, whatturns human beings into petty tyrants is precisely the obsessive manipulation ofthe known.\"Don Juan explained that the interplay of all the five attributes of warriorshipis done only by seers who are also impeccable warriors, and who have masteryover will. Such an interplay is a supreme maneuver that cannot be performed onthe daily human stage.\"Four attributes are all that is needed to deal with the worst of pettytyrants,\" he continued. \"Provided, of course, that a petty tyrant has beenfound. As I said, the petty tyrant is the outside element; the one we cannotcontrol, and the element that is perhaps the most important of them all. Mybenefactor used to say that the warrior who stumbles on a petty tyrant is alucky one. He meant that you're fortunate if you come upon one in your path;because if you don't, you have to go out and look for one.\"He explained that one of the greatest accomplishments of the seers of theConquest was a construct he called the three phase progression. By understandingthe nature of man, they were able to reach the incontestable conclusion that ifseers can hold their own in facing petty tyrants, they can certainly face theunknown with impunity; and then they can even stand the presence of theunknowable.\"The average man's reaction is to think that the order of that statement shouldbe reversed,\" he went on. \"A seer who can hold his own in the face of theunknown can certainly face petty tyrants. But that's not so. What destroyed thesuperb seers of ancient times was that assumption. We know better now. We knowthat nothing can temper the spirit of a warrior as much as the challenge ofdealing with impossible people in positions of power. Only under thoseconditions can warriors acquire the sobriety and serenity to stand the pressureof the unknowable.\"I vociferously [* vociferously- in an offensively loud manner] disagreed withhim. I told him that in my opinion tyrants can only render their victimshelpless, or make them as brutal as they themselves are. I pointed out thatcountless studies had been done on the effects of physical and psychologicaltorture on such victims.\"The difference is in something you just said,\" he retorted. \"They are victims,not warriors. Once I felt just as you do. I'll tell you what made me change, butfirst let's go back again to what I said about the Conquest. The seers of thattime couldn't have found a better ground. The Spaniards were the petty tyrantswho tested the seers' skills to the limit. After dealing with the conquerors,the seers were capable of facing anything. They were the lucky ones. At thattime there were petty tyrants everywhere.\"After all those marvelous years of abundance things changed a great deal. Pettytyrants never again had that scope. It was only during those times that thepetty tyrants' authority was unlimited. The perfect ingredient for the making ofa superb seer is a petty tyrant with unlimited prerogatives.\"In our times, unfortunately, seers have to go to extremes to find a worthy one.Most of the time they have to be satisfied with very small fry.\"\"Did you find a petty tyrant yourself, don Juan?\"\"I was lucky. A king-size one found me. At the time, though, I felt like you. Icouldn't consider myself fortunate.\"Don Juan said that his ordeal began a few weeks before he met his benefactor. Hewas barely twenty years old at the time. He had gotten a job at a sugar millworking as a laborer. He had always been very strong, so it was easy for him toget jobs that required muscle.One day when he was moving some heavy sacks of sugar a woman came by. She wasvery well dressed, and seemed to be a woman of means. She was perhaps in herfifties, don Juan said, and very domineering. She looked at don Juan and thenspoke to the foreman and left. Don Juan was then approached by the foreman whotold him that, for a fee, he would recommend him for a job in the boss's house.Don Juan told the man that he had no money. The foreman smiled and said not toworry because he would have plenty on payday. He patted don Juan's back, andassured him it was a great honor to work for the boss.Don Juan said that being a lowly ignorant Indian living hand-to-mouth, not onlydid he believe every word, he thought a good fairy had touched him. He promisedto pay the foreman anything he wished. The foreman named a large sum which hadto be paid in installments.Immediately thereafter the foreman himself took don Juan to the house, which wasquite a distance from the town, and left him there with another foreman; a huge,somber, ugly man who asked a lot of questions. He wanted to know about donJuan's family. Don Juan answered that he didn't have any. The man was so pleasedthat he even smiled through his rotten teeth.He promised don Juan that they would pay him plenty, and that he would even bein a position to save money, because he didn't have to spend any, for he wasgoing to live and eat in the house.The way the man laughed was terrifying. Don Juan knew that he had to escapeimmediately. He ran for the gate, but the man cut in front of him with arevolver in his hand. He cocked it and rammed it into don Juan's stomach.\"You're here to work yourself to the bone,\" he said. \"And don't you forget it.\"He shoved don Juan around with a billy club.Then he took him to the side of the house and, after observing that he workedhis men every day from sunrise to sunset without a break, he put don Juan towork digging out two enormous tree stumps. He also told don Juan that if he evertried to escape or went to the authorities he would shoot him dead- and that ifdon Juan should ever get away, he would swear in court that don Juan had triedto murder the boss.\"You'll work here until you die,\" he said. \"Another Indian will get your jobthen, just as you're taking a dead Indian's place.\"Don Juan said that the house looked like a fortress, with armed men withmachetes everywhere. So he got busy working and tried not to think about hispredicament. At the end of the day, the man came back and kicked him all the wayto the kitchen, because he did not like the defiant look in don Juan's eyes. Hethreatened to cut the tendons of don Juan's arms if he didn't obey him.In the kitchen an old woman brought food, but don Juan was so upset and afraidthat he couldn't eat. The old woman advised him to eat as much as he could. Hehad to be strong, she said, because his work would never end. She warned himthat the man who had held his job had died just a day earlier. He was too weakto work and had fallen from a second-story window.Don Juan said that he worked at the boss's place for three weeks and that theman bullied him every moment of every day. He made him work under the mostdangerous conditions doing the heaviest work imaginable under the constantthreat of his knife, gun, or billy club. He sent don Juan daily to the stablesto clean the stalls while the nervous stallions were in them. At the beginningof every day, don Juan thought it would be his last one on earth. And survivingmeant only that he had to go through the same hell again the next day.What precipitated the end was don Juan's request to have some time off. Thepretext was that he needed to go to town to pay the foreman of the sugar millthe money that he owed him. The other foreman retorted that don Juan could notstop working, not even for a minute, because he was in debt up to his ears justfor the privilege of working there.Don Juan knew that he was done for. He understood the man's maneuvers. Both heand the other foreman were in cahoots to get lowly Indians from the mill, workthem to death, and divide their salaries. That realization angered him sointensely that he ran through the kitchen screaming and got inside the mainhouse. The foreman and the other workers were caught totally by surprise. He ranout the front door and almost got away, but the foreman caught up with him onthe road and shot him in the chest. He left him for dead.Don Juan said that it was not his destiny to die. His benefactor found him thereand tended him until he got well.\"When I told my benefactor the whole story,\" don Juan said, \"he could hardlycontain his excitement.\"That foreman is really a prize,\" my benefactor said. \"He is too good to bewasted. Someday you must go back to that house.\"\"He raved about my luck in finding a 'one in a million' petty tyrant with almostunlimited power. I thought the old man was nuts. It was years before I fullyunderstood what he was talking about.\"\"That is one of the most horrible stories I have ever heard,\" I said. \"Did youreally go back to that house?\"\"I certainly did, three years later. My benefactor was right. A petty tyrantlike that one was one in a million and couldn't be wasted.\"\"How did you manage to go back?\"\"My benefactor developed a strategy using the four attributes of warriorship:control, discipline, forbearance, and timing.\"Don Juan said that his benefactor, in explaining to him what he had to do toprofit from facing that ogre of a man, also told him what the new seersconsidered to be the four steps on the path of knowledge.The first step is the decision to become apprentices. After the apprenticeschange their views about themselves and the world, they take the second step andbecome warriors, which is to say, beings capable of the utmost discipline andcontrol over themselves. The third step, after acquiring forbearance and timing,is to become men of knowledge. When men of knowledge learn to see they havetaken the fourth step and have become seers.His benefactor stressed the fact that don Juan had been on the path of knowledgelong enough to have acquired a minimum of the first two attributes: control anddiscipline. Don Juan emphasized that both of these attributes refer to an innerstate. A warrior is self-oriented, not in a selfish way, but in the sense of atotal and continuous examination of the self.\"At that time, I was barred from the other two attributes,\" don Juan went on.\"Forbearance and timing are not quite an inner state. They are in the domain ofthe man of knowledge. My benefactor showed them to me through his strategy.\"\"Does this mean that you couldn't have faced the petty tyrant by yourself?\" Iasked.\"I'm sure that I could have done it myself, although I have always doubted thatI would have carried it off with flair and joyfulness. My benefactor was simplyenjoying the encounter by directing it. The idea of using a petty tyrant is notonly for perfecting the warrior's spirit, but also for enjoyment and happiness.\"\"How could anyone enjoy the monster you described?\"\"He was nothing in comparison to the real monsters that the new seers facedduring the Conquest. By all indications those seers enjoyed themselves bluedealing with them. They proved that even the worst tyrants can bring delight,provided of course, that one is a warrior.\"Don Juan explained that the mistake average men make in confronting pettytyrants is not to have a strategy to fall back on. The fatal flaw is thataverage men take themselves too seriously: Their actions and feelings, as wellas those of the petty tyrants, are all-important.Warriors, on the other hand, not only have a well thought out strategy, but arefree from self-importance. What restrains their self-importance is that theyhave understood that reality is an interpretation we make. That knowledge wasthe definitive advantage that the new seers had over the simple-mindedSpaniards.He said that he became convinced he could defeat the foreman using only thesingle realization that petty tyrants take themselves with deadly seriousnesswhile warriors do not.Following his benefactor's strategic plan, therefore, don Juan got a job in thesame sugar mill as before. Nobody remembered that he had worked there in thepast: Peons came to that sugar mill and left it without leaving a trace.His benefactor's strategy specified that don Juan had to be solicitous ofwhoever came to look for another victim. As it happened, the same woman came andspotted him as she had done years ago. This time he was physically even strongerthan before.The same routine took place. The strategy, however, called for refusing paymentto the foreman from the outset. The man had never been turned down and was takenaback. He threatened to fire don Juan from the job. Don Juan threatened himback, saying that he would go directly to the lady's house and see her.Don Juan knew that the woman, who was the wife of the owner of the mill, did notknow what the two foremen were up to. He told the foreman that he knew where shelived because he had worked in the surrounding fields cutting sugar cane. Theman began to haggle, and don Juan demanded money from him before he would acceptgoing to the lady's house. The foreman gave in and handed him a few bills. DonJuan was perfectly aware that the foreman's acquiescence was just a ruse to gethim to go to the house.\"He himself once again took me to the house,\" don Juan said. \"It was an oldhacienda owned by the people of the sugar mill: rich men who either knew whatwas going on and didn't care, or were too indifferent even to notice.\"As soon as we got there, I ran into the house to look for the lady. I found herand dropped to my knees and kissed her hand to thank her. The two foremen werelivid.\"The foreman at the house followed the same pattern as before. But I had theproper equipment to deal with him. I had control, discipline, forbearance, andtiming. It turned out as my benefactor had planned it. My control made mefulfill the man's most asinine demands. What usually exhausts us in a situationlike that is the wear and tear on our self-importance. Any man who has an iotaof pride is ripped apart by being made to feel worthless.\"I gladly did everything he asked of me. I was joyful and strong, and I didn'tgive a fig about my pride or my fear. I was there as an impeccable warrior. Totune the spirit when someone is trampling on you is called control.\"Don Juan explained that his benefactor's strategy required that instead offeeling sorry for himself as he had done before, he immediately go to workmapping the man's strong points, his weaknesses, and his quirks of behavior.He found that the foreman's strongest points were his violent nature and hisdaring. He had shot don Juan in broad daylight and in sight of scores ofonlookers. His great weakness was that he liked his job and did not want toendanger it. Under no circumstances could he attempt to kill don Juan inside thecompound in the daytime. His other weakness was that he was a family man. He hada wife and children who lived in a shack near the house.\"To gather all this information while they are beating you up is calleddiscipline,\" don Juan said. \"The man was a regular fiend. He had no savinggrace. According to the new seers, a perfect petty tyrant has no redeemingfeature.\"Don Juan said that the other two attributes of warriorship, forbearance andtiming, which he did not yet have, had been automatically included in hisbenefactor's strategy. Forbearance is to wait patiently- no rush, no anxiety- asimple, joyful holding back of what is due.\"I groveled daily,\" don Juan continued, \"sometimes crying under the man's whip.And yet I was happy. My benefactor's strategy was what made me go from day today without hating the man's guts. I was a warrior. I knew that I was waitingand I knew what I was waiting for. Right there is the great joy of warriorship.\"He added that his benefactor's strategy called for a systematic harassment ofthe man by taking cover with a higher order, just as the seers of the new cyclehad done during the Conquest by shielding themselves with the Catholic church. Alowly priest was sometimes more powerful than a nobleman.Don Juan's shield was the lady who got him the job. He kneeled in front of herand called her a saint every time he saw her. He begged her to give him themedallion of her patron saint so he could pray to him for her health andwell-being.\"She gave me one,\" don Juan went on, \"and that rattled the foreman to pieces.And when I got the servants to pray at night he nearly had a heart attack. Ithink he decided then to kill me. He couldn't afford to let me go on.\"As a countermeasure, I organized a rosary among all the servants of the house.The lady thought I had the makings of a most pious man.\"I didn't sleep soundly after that, nor did I sleep in my bed. I climbed to theroof every night. From there I saw the man twice looking for me in the middle ofthe night with murder in his eyes.\"Daily he shoved me into the stallions' stalls hoping that I would be crushed todeath, but I had a plank of heavy boards that I braced against one of thecorners and protected myself behind it. The man never knew because he wasnauseated by the horses- another of his weaknesses, the deadliest of all, asthings turned out.\"Don Juan said that timing is the quality that governs the release of all that isheld back. Control, discipline, and forbearance are like a dam behind whicheverything is pooled. Timing is the gate in the dam.The man knew only the violence with which he terrorized. If his violence wasneutralized, he was rendered nearly helpless. Don Juan knew that the man wouldnot dare to kill him in view of the house, so one day, in the presence of theother workers, but in sight of his lady as well, don Juan insulted the man. Hecalled him a coward who was mortally afraid of the boss's wife.His benefactor's strategy had called for being on the alert for a moment likethat, and using it to turn the tables on the petty tyrant. Unexpected thingsalways happen that way. The lowest of the slaves suddenly makes fun of thetyrant, taunts him, makes him feel ridiculous in front of significant witnesses,and then rushes away without giving the tyrant time to retaliate.\"A moment later, the man went crazy with rage, but I was already solicitouslykneeling in front of the lady,\" he continued.Don Juan said that when the lady went inside the house, the man and his friendscalled him to the back, allegedly to do some work. The man was very pale, whitewith anger. From the sound of his voice don Juan knew what the man was reallyplanning to do. Don Juan pretended to acquiesce, but instead of heading for theback, he ran for the stables. He trusted that the horses would make such aracket that the owners would come out to see what was wrong. He knew that theman would not dare shoot him. That would have been too noisy, and the man's fearof endangering his job was too overpowering. Don Juan also knew that the manwould not go where the horses were- that is, unless he had been pushed beyondhis endurance.\"I jumped inside the stall of the wildest stallion,\" don Juan said, \"and thepetty tyrant, blinded by rage, took out his knife and jumped in after me. I wentinstantly behind my planks. The horse kicked him once and it was all over.\"I had spent six months in that house and in that period of time I had exercisedthe four attributes of warriorship. Thanks to them, I had succeeded. Not oncehad I felt sorry for myself or wept in impotence. I had been joyful and serene.My control and discipline were as keen as they'd ever been, and I had had afirsthand view of what forbearance and timing did for impeccable warriors. And Ihad not once wished the man to die.\"My benefactor explained something very interesting. Forbearance means holdingback with the spirit something that the warrior knows is rightfully due. Itdoesn't mean that a warrior goes around plotting to do anybody mischief, orplanning to settle past scores. Forbearance is something independent. As long asthe warrior has control, discipline, and timing, forbearance assures givingwhatever is due to whoever deserves it.\"\"Do petty tyrants sometimes win, and destroy the warrior facing them?\" I asked.\"Of course. There was a time when warriors died like flies at the beginning ofthe Conquest. Their ranks were decimated. The petty tyrants could put anyone todeath simply acting on a whim. Under that kind of pressure seers reached sublimestates.\"Don Juan said that that was the time when the surviving seers had to exertthemselves to the limit to find new ways.\"The new seers used petty tyrants,\" don Juan said, staring at me fixedly, \"notonly to get rid of their self-importance, but to accomplish the verysophisticated maneuver of moving themselves out of this world. You'll understandthat maneuver as we keep on discussing the mastery of awareness.\"I explained to don Juan that what I had wanted to know was whether, in thepresent, in our times, the petty tyrants he had called small fry could everdefeat a warrior.\"All the time,\" he replied. \"The consequences aren't as dire as those in theremote past. Today it goes without saying that warriors always have a chance torecuperate, or to retrieve and come back later. But there is another side tothis problem. To be defeated by a small-fry petty tyrant is not deadly, butdevastating. The degree of mortality, in a figurative sense, is almost as high.By that I mean that warriors who succumb to a small-fry petty tyrant areobliterated by their own sense of failure and unworthiness. That spells highmortality to me.\"\"How do you measure defeat?\"\"Anyone who joins the petty tyrant is defeated. To act in anger, without controland discipline, to have no forbearance, is to be defeated.\"\"What happens after warriors are defeated?\"\"They either regroup themselves, or they abandon the quest for knowledge andjoin the ranks of the petty tyrants for life.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"3. The Eagle's EmanationsThe next day, don Juan and I went for a walk along the road to the city ofOaxaca. The road was deserted at that hour. It was 2:00 p.m.As we strolled leisurely, don Juan suddenly began to talk. He said that ourdiscussion about the petty tyrants had been merely an introduction to the topicof awareness. I remarked that it had opened a new view for me. He asked me toexplain what I meant.I told him that it had to do with an argument we had had some years before aboutthe Yaqui Indians. In the course of his teachings for the right side, he hadtried to tell me about the advantages that the Yaquis could find in beingoppressed. I had passionately argued that there were no possible advantages inthe wretched conditions in which they lived. And I had told him that I could notunderstand how, being a Yaqui himself, he did not react against such a flagrantinjustice.He had listened attentively. Then, when I was sure he was going to defend hispoint, he agreed that the conditions of the Yaqui Indians were indeed wretched.But he pointed out that it was useless to single out the Yaquis when lifeconditions of man in general were horrendous.\"Don't just feel sorry for the poor Yaqui Indians,\" he had said. \"Feel sorry formankind. In the case of the Yaqui Indians, I can even say they're the luckyones. They are oppressed, and because of that, some of them may come outtriumphant in the end. But the oppressors, the petty tyrants that tread uponthem, they don't have a chance in hell.\"I had immediately answered him with a barrage of political slogans. I had notunderstood his point at all. He again tried to explain to me the concept ofpetty tyrants, but the whole idea bypassed me. It was only now that everythingfit into place.\"Nothing has fit into place yet,\" he said, laughing at what I had told him.\"Tomorrow, when you are in your normal state of awareness, you won't evenremember what you've realized now.\"I felt utterly depressed, for I knew he was right.\"What's going to happen to you is what happened to me,\" he continued. \"Mybenefactor, the nagual Julian, made me realize in heightened awareness what youhave realized yourself about petty tyrants. And I ended up, in my daily life,changing my opinions without knowing why.\"I had always been oppressed, so I had real venom toward my oppressors, imaginemy surprise when I found myself seeking the company of petty tyrants. I thoughtI had lost my mind.\"We came to a place on the side of the road where some large boulders were halfburied by an old landslide. Don Juan headed for them and sat down on a flatrock. He signaled me to sit down, facing him. And then without furtherpreliminaries, he started his explanation of the mastery of awareness.He said that there were a series of truths that seers, old and new, haddiscovered about awareness, and that such truths had been arranged in a specificsequence for purposes of comprehension.He explained that the mastery of awareness consisted in internalizing the totalsequence of such truths. The first truth, he said, was that our familiarity withthe world we perceive compels us to believe that we are surrounded by objects,existing by themselves and as themselves, just as we perceive them, whereas, infact, there is no world of objects, but a universe of the Eagle's emanations.He told me then that before he could explain the Eagle's emanations, he had totalk about the known, the unknown, and the unknowable. Most of the truths aboutawareness were discovered by the old seers, he said. But the order in which theywere arranged had been worked out by the new seers. And without that order thosetruths were nearly incomprehensible.He said that 'not to seek order' was one of the great mistakes that the ancientseers made. A deadly consequence of that mistake was their assumption that theunknown and the unknowable are the same thing. It was up to the new seers tocorrect that error. They set up boundaries and defined the unknown as somethingthat is veiled from man, shrouded perhaps by a terrifying context, but which,nonetheless, is within man's reach. The unknown becomes the known at a giventime. The unknowable, on the other hand, is the indescribable, the unthinkable,and the unrealizable. It is something that will never be known to us, and yet itis there; dazzling and at the same time horrifying in its vastness.\"How can seers make the distinction between the two?\" I asked.\"There is a simple rule of thumb,\" he said. \"In the face of the unknown, man isadventurous. It is a quality of the unknown to give us a sense of hope andhappiness. Man feels robust, exhilarated. Even the apprehension that it arousesis very fulfilling. The new seers saw that man is at his best in the face of theunknown.\"He said that whenever what is taken to be the unknown turns out to be theunknowable the results are disastrous. Seers feel drained, confused. A terribleoppression takes possession of them. Their bodies lose tone, their reasoning andsobriety wander away aimlessly. For the unknowable has no energizing effectswhatsoever. It is not within human reach; therefore, it should not be intrudedupon foolishly or even prudently. The new seers realized that they had to beprepared to pay exorbitant prices for the faintest contact with it.Don Juan explained that the new seers had had formidable barriers of traditionto overcome. At the time when the new cycle began, none of them knew for certainwhich procedures of their immense tradition were the right ones and which werenot. Obviously, something had gone wrong with the ancient seers, but the newseers did not know what. They began by assuming that everything theirpredecessors had done was erroneous. Those ancient seers had been the masters ofconjecture. They had, for one thing, assumed that their proficiency in seeingwas a safeguard. They thought that they were untouchable- that is until theinvaders smashed them, and put most of them to horrendous deaths. The ancientseers had no protection whatsoever despite their total certainty that they wereinvulnerable.The new seers did not waste their time in speculations about what went wrong.Instead, they began to map the unknown in order to separate it from theunknowable.\"How did they map the unknown, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Through the controlled use of seeing,\" he replied.I said that what I had meant to ask was, what was entailed in mapping theunknown?He answered that mapping the unknown means making it available to ourperception. By steadily practicing seeing, the new seers found that the unknownand the known are really on the same footing because both are within the reachof human perception. Seers, in fact, can leave the known at a given moment andenter into the unknown.Whatever is beyond our capacity to perceive is the unknowable. And thedistinction between it and the knowable is crucial. Confusing the two would putseers in a most precarious position whenever they are confronted with theunknowable.\"When this happened to the ancient seers,\" don Juan went on, \"they thought theirprocedures had gone haywire. It never occurred to them that most of what's outthere is beyond our comprehension. It was a terrifying error of judgment ontheir part for which they paid dearly.\"\"What happened after the distinction between the unknown and the unknowable wasrealized?\" I asked.\"The new cycle began,\" he replied. \"That distinction is the frontier between theold and the new. Everything that the new seers have done stems fromunderstanding that distinction.\"Don Juan said that seeing was the crucial element in both the destruction of theancient seers' world and in the reconstruction of the new view. It was throughseeing that the new seers discovered certain undeniable facts which they used toarrive at certain conclusions, revolutionary to them, about the nature of manand the world. These conclusions, which made the new cycle possible, were thetruths about awareness he was explaining to me.Don Juan asked me to accompany him to the center of town for a stroll around thesquare. On our way, we began to talk about machines and delicate instruments. Hesaid that instruments are extensions of our senses, and I maintained that thereare instruments that are not in that category because they perform functionsthat we are not physiologically capable of performing.\"Our senses are capable of everything,\" he asserted.\"I can tell you offhand,\" I said, \"that there are instruments that can detectradio waves that come from outer space. Our senses cannot detect radio waves.\"\"I have a different idea,\" he said. \"I think our senses can detect everything weare surrounded by.\"\"What about the case of ultrasonic sounds?\" I insisted. \"We don't have theorganic equipment to hear them.\"\"It is the seers' conviction that we've tapped a very small portion ofourselves,\" he replied.He immersed himself in thought for a while as if he were trying to decide whatto say next. Then he smiled.\"The first truth about awareness, as I have already told you,\" he began, \"isthat the world out there is not really as we think it is. We think it is a worldof objects and it's not.\"He paused as if to measure the effect of his words. I told him that I agreedwith his premise because everything could be reduced to being a field of energy.He said that I was merely intuiting a truth, and that to reason it out was notto verify it. He said he was not interested in my agreement or disagreement, butrather in my attempt to comprehend what was involved in that truth.\"You cannot witness fields of energy,\" he went on. \"Not as an average man, thatis. Now, if you were able to see them, you would be a seer, in which case youwould be explaining the truths about awareness. Do you understand what I mean?\"He went on to say that conclusions arrived at through reasoning had very littleor no influence in altering the course of our lives. Hence, the countlessexamples of people who have the clearest convictions, and yet act diametricallyagainst them time and time again; and they have, as the only explanation fortheir behavior, the idea that to err is human.\"The first truth is that the world is as it looks and yet it isn't,\" he went on.\"It's not as solid and real as our perception has been led to believe.\"But it isn't a mirage either. The world is not an illusion, as it has been saidto be. It's real on the one hand, and unreal on the other. Pay close attentionto this, for it must be understood, not just accepted. We perceive. This is ahard fact. But what we perceive is not a fact of the same kind, because we learnwhat to perceive.\"Something out there is affecting our senses. This is the part that is real. Theunreal part is what our senses tell us is there. Take a mountain, for instance.Our senses tell us that it is an object. It has size, color, form. We even havecategories of mountains, and they are downright accurate. Nothing wrong withthat. The flaw is simply that it has never occurred to us that our senses playonly a superficial role. Our senses perceive the way they do because a specificfeature of our awareness forces them to do so.\"I began to agree with him again, but not because I wanted to, for I had notquite understood his point. Rather, I was reacting to a threatening situation.He made me stop.\"I've used the term 'the world',\" don Juan went on, \"to mean everything thatsurrounds us. I have a better term, of course, but it would be quiteincomprehensible to you. Seers say that we think there is a world of objects outthere only because of our awareness. But what's really out there are the Eagle'semanations, fluid, forever in motion, and yet unchanged; eternal.\"He stopped me with a gesture of his hand just as I was about to ask him what theEagle's emanations were. He explained that one of the most dramatic legacies theold seers had left us was their discovery that the reason for the existence ofall sentient beings is to enhance awareness. Don Juan called it a colossaldiscovery.In a half-serious tone he asked me if I knew of a better answer to the questionthat has always haunted man: the reason for our existence. I immediately took adefensive position and began to argue about the meaninglessness of the questionbecause it cannot be logically answered. I told him that in order to discussthat subject we would have to talk about religious beliefs and turn it all intoa matter of faith.\"The old seers were not just talking about faith,\" he said. \"Although they werenot as practical as the new seers, they were practical enough to know what theywere seeing.\"What I was trying to point out to you with that question, which has rattled youso badly, is that our rationality alone cannot come up with an answer about thereason for our existence. Every time it tries, the answer turns into a matter ofbeliefs. The old seers took another road, and they did find an answer whichdoesn't involve faith alone.\"He said that the old seers, risking untold dangers, actually saw theindescribable force which is the source of all sentient beings. They called itthe Eagle because in the few glimpses that they could sustain, they saw it assomething that resembled a black-and-white eagle of infinite size.They saw that it is the Eagle who bestows awareness. The Eagle creates sentientbeings so that they will live and enrich the awareness it gives them with life.They also saw that it is the Eagle who devours that same enriched awarenessafter making sentient beings relinquish it at the moment of death.\"For the old seers,\" don Juan went on, \"to say that the reason for existence isto enhance awareness is not a matter of faith or deduction. They saw it.\"They saw that the awareness of sentient beings flies away at the moment ofdeath and floats like a luminous cotton puff right into the Eagle's beak to beconsumed. For the old seers that was the evidence that sentient beings live onlyto enrich the awareness that is the Eagle's food.\" Don Juan's elucidation was interrupted because he had to leave on a shortbusiness trip. Nestor drove him to Oaxaca. As I saw them off, I remembered thatat the beginning of my association with don Juan, every time he mentioned abusiness trip I thought he was employing a euphemism for something else.I eventually realized that he meant what he said. Whenever such a trip was aboutto take place, he would put on one of his many immaculately tailored three-piecesuits and would look like anything but the old Indian I knew. I had commented tohim about the sophistication of his metamorphosis.\"A nagual is someone flexible enough to be anything,\" he had said. \"To be anagual, among other things, means to have no points to defend. Remember this-we'll come back to it over and over.\"We had come back to it over and over, in every possible way. He did indeed seemto have no points to defend, but during his absence in Oaxaca, I was given tojust a shadow of doubt. Suddenly I realized that a nagual did have one point todefend. The 'description of the Eagle', and 'what the Eagle does' required, inmy opinion, a passionate defense.I tried to pose that question to some of don Juan's companions, but they eludedmy probings. They told me that I was in quarantine from that kind of discussionuntil don Juan had finished his explanation.The moment he returned, we sat down to talk and I asked him about it. \"Those truths are not something to defend passionately,\" he replied. \"If youthink that I'm trying to defend them, you are mistaken. Those truths were puttogether for the delight and enlightenment of warriors, not to engage anyproprietary sentiments. When I told you that a nagual has no points to defend, Imeant, among other things, that a nagual has no obsessions.\"I told him that I was not following his teachings, for I had become obsessedwith his description of the Eagle and what it does. I remarked over and overabout the awesomeness of such an idea.\"It is not just an idea,\" he said. \"It is a fact. And a darn scary one if youask me. The new seers were not simply playing with ideas.\"\"But what kind of a force would the Eagle be?\"\"I wouldn't know how to answer that. The Eagle is as real for the seers asgravity and time are for you, and just as abstract and incomprehensible.\"\"Wait a minute, don Juan. Those are abstract concepts, but they do refer to realphenomena that can be corroborated. There are whole disciplines dedicated tothat.\"\"The Eagle and its emanations are equally corroboratable,\" don Juan retorted.\"And the discipline of the new seers is dedicated to doing just that.\"I asked him to explain what the Eagle's emanations are.He said that the Eagle's emanations are an immutable thing-in-itself, whichengulfs everything that exists; the knowable and the unknowable.\"There is no way to describe in words what the Eagle's emanations really are,\"don Juan continued. \"A seer must witness them.\"\"Have you witnessed them yourself, don Juan?\"\"Of course I have, and yet I can't tell you what they are. They are a presence;almost a mass of sorts; a pressure that creates a dazzling sensation. One cancatch only a glimpse of them, as one can catch only a glimpse of the Eagleitself.\"\"Would you say, don Juan, that the Eagle is the source of the emanations?\"\"It goes without saying that the Eagle is the source of its emanations.\"\"I meant to ask if that is so visually.\"\"There is nothing visual about the Eagle. The entire body of a seer senses theEagle. There is something in all of us that can make us witness with our entirebody. Seers explain the act of seeing the Eagle in very simple terms: becauseman is composed of the Eagle's emanations, man need only revert back to hiscomponents.\"The problem arises with man's awareness. It is his awareness that becomesentangled and confused. At the crucial moment when it should be a simple case ofthe emanations acknowledging themselves, man's awareness is compelled tointerpret. The result is a vision of the Eagle and the Eagle's emanations. Butthere is no Eagle and no Eagle's emanations. What is out there is something thatno living creature can grasp.\"I asked him if the source of the emanations was called the Eagle because eaglesin general have important attributes.\"This is simply the case of something unknowable vaguely resembling somethingknown,\" he replied. \"On account of that, there have certainly been attempts toimbue eagles with attributes they don't have. But that always happens whenimpressionable people learn to perform acts that require great sobriety. Seerscome in all sizes and shapes.\"\"Do you mean to say that there are different kinds of seers?\"\"No. I mean that there are scores of imbeciles who become seers. Seers are humanbeings full of foibles, or rather, human beings full of foibles are capable ofbecoming seers. Just as in the case of miserable people who become superbscientists.\"The characteristic of miserable seers is that they are willing to forget thewonder of the world. They become overwhelmed by the fact that they see andbelieve that it's their genius that counts. A seer must be a paragon in order tooverride the nearly invincible laxness of our human condition. More importantthan seeing itself is what seers do with what they see.\"\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\"\"Look at what some seers have done to us. We are stuck with their vision of anEagle that rules us and devours us at the moment of our death.\"He said that there is a definite laxness in that version, and that personally hedid not appreciate the idea of something devouring us. For him, it would be moreaccurate to say that there is a force that attracts our consciousness, much as amagnet attracts iron shavings. At the moment of dying, all of our beingdisintegrates under the attraction of that immense force.That such an event was interpreted as the Eagle devouring us he found grotesque,because it turns an indescribable act into something as mundane as eating.\"I'm a very average man,\" I said. \"The description of an Eagle that devours ushad a great impact on me.\"\"The real impact can't be measured until the moment when you see it yourself,\"he said. \"But you must bear in mind that our flaws remain with us even after webecome seers. So when you see that force, you may very well agree with the laxseers who called it the Eagle, as I did myself. On the other hand, you may not.You may resist the temptation to ascribe human attributes to what isincomprehensible, and actually improvise a new name for it; a more accurateone.\"\"Seers who see the Eagle's emanations often call them commands,\" don Juan said.\"I wouldn't mind calling them commands myself if I hadn't got used to callingthem emanations. It was a reaction to my benefactor's preference; for him theywere commands. I thought that term was more in keeping with his forcefulpersonality than with mine. I wanted something impersonal. 'Commands' sounds toohuman to me, but that's what they really are, commands.\"Don Juan said that to see the Eagle's emanations is to court disaster. The newseers soon discovered the tremendous difficulties involved, and only after greattribulations in trying to map the unknown and separate it from the unknowabledid they realize that everything is made out of the Eagle's emanations. Only asmall portion of those emanations is within reach of human awareness, and thatsmall portion is still further reduced, to a minute fraction, by the constraintsof our daily lives.That minute fraction of the Eagle's emanations is the known. The small portionwithin possible reach of human awareness is the unknown. The incalculable restis the unknowable.He went on to say that the new seers, being pragmatically oriented, becameimmediately cognizant of the compelling power of the emanations. They realizedthat all living creatures are forced to employ the Eagle's emanations withoutever knowing what they are. They also realized that organisms are constructed tograsp a certain range of those emanations and that every species has a definiterange. The emanations exert great pressure on organisms, and through thatpressure organisms construct their perceivable world.\"In our case, as human beings,\" don Juan said, \"we employ those emanations andinterpret them as reality. But what man senses is such a small portion of theEagle's emanations that it's ridiculous to put much stock in our perceptions,and yet it isn't possible for us to disregard our perceptions. The new seersfound this out the hard way after courting tremendous dangers.\" Don Juan was sitting where he usually sat in the large room. Ordinarily therewas no furniture in that room- people sat on mats on the floor- but Carol, thenagual woman, had managed to furnish it with very comfortable armchairs for thesessions when she and I took turns reading to don Juan from the works ofSpanish-speaking poets.\"I want you to be very aware of what we are doing,\" he said as soon as I satdown. \"We are discussing the mastery of awareness. The truths we're discussingare the principles of that mastery.\"He added that in his teachings for the right side, he had demonstrated thoseprinciples to my normal awareness with the help of one of his seer companions,Genaro, and that Genaro had played around with my awareness with all the humorand irreverence for which the new seers were known.\"Genaro is the one who should be here telling you about the Eagle,\" he said,\"except that his versions are too irreverent. He thinks that the seers whocalled that force the Eagle were either very stupid or were making a grand joke,because eagles not only lay eggs, they also lay turds.\"Don Juan laughed and said that he found Genaro's comments so appropriate that hecouldn't resist laughter. He added that if the new seers had been the ones todescribe the Eagle the description would certainly have been made half in fun.I told don Juan that on one level I took the Eagle as a poetic image, and assuch it delighted me; but on another level I took it literally, and thatterrified me.\"One of the greatest forces in the lives of warriors is fear,\" he said. \"Itspurs them to learn.\"He reminded me that the description of the Eagle came from the ancient seers.The new seers were through with description, comparison, and conjecture of anysort. They wanted to get directly to the source of things and consequentlyrisked unlimited danger to get to it.They did see the Eagle's emanations, but they never tampered with thedescription of the Eagle. They felt that it took too much energy to see theEagle, and that the ancient seers had already paid heavily for their scantglimpse of the unknowable.\"How did the old seers come around to describing the Eagle?\" I asked.\"They needed a minimal set of guidelines about the unknowable for purposes ofinstruction,\" he replied. \"They resolved it with a sketchy description of theforce that rules all there is, but not of its emanations, because the emanationscannot be rendered at all in a language of comparisons. Individual seers mayfeel the urge to make comments about certain emanations, but that will remainpersonal. In other words, there is no pat version of the emanations, as there isof the Eagle.\"\"The new seers seem to have been very abstract,\" I commented. \"They sound likemodern-day philosophers.\"\"No. The new seers were terribly practical men,\" he replied. \"They weren'tinvolved in concocting rational theories.\"He said that the ancient seers were the ones who were the abstract thinkers.They built monumental edifices of abstractions proper to them and their time.And just like the modern-day philosophers, they were not at all in control oftheir concatenations.The new seers, on the other hand, imbued with practicality, were able to see aflux of emanations and to see how man and other living beings utilize them toconstruct their perceivable world.\"How are those emanations utilized by man, don Juan?\"\"It's so simple it sounds idiotic. For a seer, men are luminous beings. Ourluminosity is made up of that portion of the Eagle's emanations which is encasedin our egglike cocoon. That particular portion- that handful of emanations thatis encased, is what makes us men. To perceive is to match the emanationscontained inside our cocoon with those that are outside.\"Seers can see, for instance, the emanations inside any living creature and cantell which of the outside emanations would match them.\"\"Are the emanations like beams of light?\" I asked.\"No. Not at all. That would be too simple. They are something indescribable. Andyet, my personal comment would be to say that they are like filaments of light.\"What's incomprehensible to normal awareness is that the filaments are aware. Ican't tell you what that means, because I don't know what I am saying. All I cantell you with my personal comments is that the filaments are aware ofthemselves, alive and vibrating; that there are so many of them that numbershave no meaning and that each of them is an eternity in itself.\"================================================================="},{"pageContent":"4. The Glow of AwarenessDon Juan, don Genaro, and I had just returned from gathering plants in thesurrounding mountains. We were at don Genaro's house, sitting around the table,when don Juan made me change levels of awareness. Don Genaro had been staring atme and began to chuckle. He remarked how odd he thought it was that I had twocompletely different standards for dealing with the two sides of awareness.My relation with him was the most obvious example. On my right side, he was therespected and feared sorcerer don Genaro, a man whose incomprehensible actsdelighted me and at the same time filled me with mortal terror. On my left side,he was plain Genaro, or Genarito, with no don attached to his name; a charmingand kind seer whose acts were thoroughly comprehensible and coherent with what Imyself did or tried to do.I agreed with him and added that on my left side, the man whose mere presencemade me shake like a leaf was Silvio Manuel, the most mysterious of don Juan'scompanions. I also said that don Juan, being a true nagual, transcendedarbitrary standards and was respected and admired by me in both states.\"But is he feared?\" Genaro asked in a quivering voice.\"Very feared,\" don Juan interjected in a falsetto voice.We all laughed, but don Juan and Genaro laughed with such abandon that Iimmediately suspected they knew something they were holding back.Don Juan was reading me like a book. He explained that in the intermediatestage, before one enters fully into the left-side awareness, one is capable oftremendous concentration; but one is also susceptible to every conceivableinfluence. I was being influenced by suspicion.\"La Gorda is always in this stage,\" he said. \"She learns beautifully, but she'sa royal pain in the neck. She can't help being driven by anything that comes herway, including, of corse, very good things like keen concentration.\"Don Juan explained that the new seers discovered that the transition period isthe time when the deepest learning takes place, and that it is also the timewhen warriors must be supervised; and explanations must be given to them so theycan evaluate them properly. If no explanations are given to them before theyenter into the left side, they will be great sorcerers but poor seers, as theancient Toltecs were.Female warriors in particular fall prey to the lure of the left side, he said.They are so nimble that they can go into the left side with no effort; often toosoon for their own good.After a long silence, Genaro fell asleep. Don Juan began to speak. He said thatthe new seers had had to invent a number of terms in order to explain the secondtruth about awareness. His benefactor had changed some of those terms to suithimself, and he himself had done the same, guided by the seers' belief that itdoes not make any difference what terms are used as long as the truths have beenverified by seeing.I was curious to know what terms he had changed, but I didn't know quite how toword my question. He took it that I was doubting his right or his ability tochange them and explained that if the terms we propose originate in our reasonthey can only communicate the mundane agreement of everyday life. When seerspropose a term, on the other hand, it is never a figure of speech because itstems from seeing and embraces everything that seers can attain.I asked him why he had changed the terms.\"It's a nagual's duty always to look for better ways to explain,\" he replied.\"Time changes everything, and every new nagual has to incorporate new words andnew ideas to describe his seeing.\"\"Do you mean that a nagual takes ideas from the world of every day life?\" Iasked.\"No. I mean that a nagual talks about seeing in ever new ways,\" he said. \"Forinstance, as the new nagual, you'd have to say that awareness gives rise toperception. You'd be saying the same thing my benefactor said, but in adifferent way.\"\"What do the new seers say perception is, don Juan?\"\"They say that perception is a condition of alignment. The emanations inside thecocoon become aligned with those outside that fit them. Alignment is what allowsawareness to be cultivated by every living creature. Seers make these statementsbecause they see living creatures as they really are: luminous beings that looklike bubbles of whitish light.\"I asked him how the emanations inside the cocoon fit those outside so as toaccomplish perception.\"The emanations inside and the emanations outside,\" he said, \"are the samefilaments of light. Sentient [* sentient- consciously perceiving] beings areminute bubbles made out of those filaments; microscopic points of light,attached to the infinite emanations.\"He went on to explain that the luminosity of living beings is made by theparticular portion of the Eagle's emanations they happen to have inside theirluminous cocoons. When seers see perception, they witness that the luminosity ofthe Eagle's emanations outside those creatures' cocoons brightens the luminosityof the emanations inside their cocoons. The outside luminosity attracts theinside one. It traps it, so to speak, and fixes it. That fixation is theawareness of every specific being.Seers can also see how the emanations outside the cocoon exert a particularpressure on the portion of emanations inside. This pressure determines thedegree of awareness that every living being has.I asked him to clarify how the Eagle's emanations outside the cocoon exertpressure on those inside.\"The Eagle's emanations are more than filaments of light,\" he replied. \"Each oneof them is a source of boundless energy. Think of it this way: Since some of theemanations outside the cocoon are the same as the emanations inside, theirenergies are like a continuous pressure. But the cocoon isolates the emanationsthat are inside its web and thereby directs the pressure.\"I've mentioned to you that the old seers were masters of the art of handlingawareness,\" he went on. \"What I can add now is that they were the masters ofthat art because they learned to manipulate the structure of man's cocoon. I'vesaid to you that they unraveled the mystery of being aware. By that I meant thatthey saw and realized that awareness is a glow in the cocoon of living beings.They rightly called it the glow of awareness.\"He explained that the old seers saw that man's awareness is a glow of amberluminosity more intense than the rest of the cocoon. That glow is on a narrow,vertical band on the extreme right side of the cocoon, running along its entirelength. The mastery of the old seers was to move that glow, to make it spreadfrom its original setting on the surface of the cocoon inward across its width.He stopped talking and looked at Genaro, who was still sound asleep.\"Genaro doesn't give a fig about explanations,\" he said. \"He's a doer. Mybenefactor pushed him constantly to face insoluble problems. So he entered intothe left side proper and never had a chance to ponder and wonder.\"\"Is it better to be that way, don Juan?\"\"It depends. For him, it's perfect. For you and for me, it wouldn't besatisfactory because in one way or another we are called upon to explain. Genaroor my benefactor are more like the old than the new seers. They can control anddo what they want with the glow of awareness.\"He stood up from the mat where we were sitting and stretched his arms and legs.I pressed him to continue talking. He smiled and said that I needed to rest,that my concentration was waning. There was a knock at the door. I woke up. It was dark. For a moment I could notremember where I was. There was something in me that was far away, as if part ofme were still asleep, yet I was fully awake. Enough moonlight came through theopen window so that I could see.I saw don Genaro get up and go to the door. I realized then that I was at hishouse. Don Juan was sound asleep on a mat on the floor. I had the distinctimpression that the three of us had fallen asleep after returning dead tiredfrom a trip to the mountains.Don Genaro lit his kerosene lantern. I followed him into the kitchen. Someonehad brought him a pot of hot stew and a stack of tortillas.\"Who brought you food?\" I asked him. \"Do you have a woman around here that cooksfor you?\"Don Juan had come into the kitchen. Both of them looked at me, smiling. For somereason their smiles were terrifying to me. I was about to scream in terror, infact, when don Juan hit me on the back and made me shift into a state ofheightened awareness. I realized then that perhaps during my sleep, or as I wokeup, I had drifted back to everyday awareness.The sensation I experienced then, once I was back in heightened awareness, was amixture of relief and anger and the most acute sadness. I was relieved that Iwas myself again- for I had come to regard those incomprehensible states asbeing my true self. There was one simple reason for that. In those states I feltcomplete. Nothing was missing from me. The anger and the sadness were a reactionto impotence. I was more aware than ever of the limitations of my being.I asked don Juan to explain to me how it was possible for me to do what I wasdoing. In states of heightened awareness I could look back and remembereverything about myself. I could give an account of everything I had done ineither state. I could even remember my incapacity to recollect.But once I had returned to my normal, everyday level of awareness I could notrecall anything I had done in heightened awareness, even if my life depended onit.\"Hold it, hold it there,\" he said. \"You haven't remembered anything yet.Heightened awareness is only an intermediate state. There is infinitely morebeyond that, and you have been there many, many times. Right now you can'tremember, even if your life depends on it.\"He was right. I had no idea what he was talking about. I pleaded for anexplanation.\"The explanation is coming,\" he said. \"It's a slow process, but we'll get to it.It is slow because I am just like you. I like to understand. I am the oppositeof my benefactor who was not given to explaining. For him there was only action.He used to put us squarely against incomprehensible problems and let us resolvethem for ourselves. Some of us never did resolve anything, and we ended up verymuch in the same boat with the old seers: all action and no real knowledge.\"\"Are those memories trapped in my mind?\" I asked.\"No. That would make it too simple,\" he replied. \"The actions of seers are morecomplex than dividing a man into mind and body. You have forgotten what you'vedone, or what you've witnessed, because when you were performing what you'veforgotten you were seeing.\"I asked don Juan to reinterpret what he had just said.Patiently, he explained that everything I had forgotten had taken place instates in which my everyday awareness had been enhanced and intensified; acondition that meant that other areas of my total being were used.\"Whatever you've forgotten is trapped in those areas of your total being,\" hesaid. \"To be using those other areas is to see.\"\"I'm more confused than ever, don Juan,\" I said.\"I don't blame you,\" he said. \"Seeing is to lay bare the core of everything; towitness the unknown and to glimpse into the unknowable. As such, it doesn'tbring one solace. Seers ordinarily go to pieces on finding out that existence isincomprehensibly complex, and that our normal awareness maligns it with itslimitations.\"He reiterated that my concentration had to be total; that to understand was ofcrucial importance; that the new seers placed the highest value on deep,unemotional realizations.\"For instance, the other day,\" he went on, \"when you understood about la Gorda'sand your self-importance, you didn't understand anything really. You had anemotional outburst. That was all. I say this because the next day you were backon your high horse of self-importance as if you never had realized anything.\"The same thing happened to the old seers. They were given to emotionalreactions. But when the time came for them to understand what they had seen,they couldn't do it. To understand one needs sobriety, not emotionality. Bewareof those who weep with realization, for they have realized nothing.\"There are untold dangers in the path of knowledge for those without soberunderstanding,\" he continued. \"I am outlining the order in which the new seersarranged the truths about awareness so it will serve you as a map; a map thatyou have to corroborate with your seeing, but not with your eyes.\"There was a long pause. He stared at me. He was definitely waiting for me to askhim a question.\"Everybody falls prey to the mistake that seeing is done with the eyes,\" hecontinued. \"But don't be surprised that after so many years you haven't realizedyet that seeing is not a matter of the eyes. It's quite normal to make thatmistake.\"\"What is seeing, then?\" I asked.He replied that seeing is alignment. And I reminded him that he had said thatperception is alignment. He explained then that the alignment of emanations usedroutinely is the perception of the day-to-day world, but the alignment ofemanations that are never used ordinarily is seeing. When such an alignmentoccurs one sees. Seeing, therefore, being produced by alignment out of theordinary, cannot be something one could merely look at. He said that in spite ofthe fact that I had seen countless times, it had not occurred to me to disregardmy eyes. I had succumbed to the way seeing is labeled and described.\"When seers see, something explains everything as the new alignment takesplace,\" he continued. \"It's a voice that tells them in their ear what's what. Ifthat voice is not present, what the seer is engaged in isn't seeing.\"After a moment's pause, he continued explaining the voice of seeing. He saidthat it was equally fallacious to say that seeing was hearing, because it wasinfinitely more than that, but that seers had opted for using sound as a gaugeof a new alignment.He called the voice of seeing a most mysterious inexplicable thing.\"My personal conclusion is that the voice of seeing belongs only to man,\" hesaid. \"The voice may happen because talking is something that no other beingbesides man talks.The old seers believed it was the voice of an overpowering entity intimatelyrelated to mankind; a protector of man. The new seers found out that thatentity, which they called the mold of man, doesn't have a voice. The voice ofseeing for the new seers is something quite incomprehensible. They say it's theglow of awareness playing on the Eagle's emanations as a harpist plays on aharp.\"He refused to explain it any further, arguing that later on, as he proceededwith his explanation, everything would become clear to me. My concentration had been so total while don Juan spoke that I actually did notremember sitting down at the table to eat. When don Juan stopped talking, Inoticed that his plate of stew was nearly finished.Genaro was staring at me with a beaming smile. My plate was in front of me onthe table, and it too was empty. There was only a tiny residue of stew left init as if I had just finished eating. I did not remember eating it at all, butneither did I remember walking to the table or sitting down.\"Did you like the stew?\" Genaro asked me and looked away.I said I did, because I did not want to admit that I was having problemsrecollecting.\"It had too much chile for my taste,\" Genaro said. \"You never eat hot foodyourself, so I'm sort of worried about what it will do to you. You shouldn'thave eaten two servings. I suppose you're a little more piggish when you're inheightened awareness, eh?\"I admitted that he was probably right. He handed me a large pitcher of water toquench my thirst and soothe my throat. When I eagerly drank all of it, both ofthem broke into howling laughter.Suddenly, I realized what was going on. My realization was physical. It was aflash of yellowish light that hit me as if a match had been struck right betweenmy eyes. I knew then that Genaro was joking. I had not eaten. I had been soabsorbed in don Juan's explanation that I had forgotten about everything else.The plate in front of me was Genaro's.After dinner don Juan went on with his explanation about the glow of awareness.Genaro sat by me, listening as if he had never heard the explanation before. Don Juan said that the pressure that the emanations outside the cocoon, whichare called emanations at large, exert on the emanations inside the cocoon is thesame in all sentient beings. Yet the results of that pressure are vastlydifferent among them because their cocoons react to that pressure in everyconceivable way. There are, however, degrees of uniformity within certainboundaries.\"Now,\" he went on, \"when seers see that the pressure of the emanations at largebears down on the emanations inside which are always in motion, and makes themstop moving, they know that the luminous being at that moment is fixated byawareness.\"To say that the emanations at large bear down on those inside the cocoon andmake them stop moving means that seers see something indescribable, the meaningof which they know without a shadow of doubt. It means that the voice of seeinghas told them that the emanations inside the cocoon are completely at rest andmatch some of those which are outside.\"He said that seers maintain, naturally, that awareness always comes from outsideourselves, that the real mystery is not inside us. Since by nature theemanations at large are made to fixate what is inside the cocoon, the trick ofawareness is to let the fixating emanations merge with what is inside us. Seersbelieve that if we let that happen we become what we really are- fluid, foreverin motion, eternal.There was a long pause. Don Juan's eyes had an intense shine. They seemed to belooking at me from a great depth. I had the feeling that each of his eyes was anindependent point of brilliance. For an instant he appeared to be strugglingagainst an invisible force; a fire from within that intended to consume him. Itpassed and he went on talking.\"The degree of awareness of every individual sentient being,\" he continued,\"depends on the degree to which it is capable of letting the pressure of theemanations at large carry it.\"After a long interruption, don Juan continued explaining. He said that seers sawthat from the moment of conception awareness is enhanced; enriched by theprocess of being alive. He said that seers saw, for instance, that the awarenessof an individual insect or that of an individual man grows from the moment ofconception in astoundingly different ways, but with equal consistency.\"Is it from the moment of conception or from the moment of birth that awarenessdevelops?\" I asked.\"Awareness develops from the moment of conception,\" he replied. \"I have alwaystold you that sexual energy is something of ultimate importance and that it hasto be controlled and used with great care. But you have always resented what Isaid, because you thought I was speaking of control in terms of morality. Ialways meant it in terms of saving and rechanneling energy.\"Don Juan looked at Genaro. Genaro nodded his head in approval.\"Genaro is going to tell you what our benefactor, the nagual Julian, used to sayabout saving and rechanneling sexual energy,\" don Juan said to me.\"The nagual Julian used to say that to have sex is a matter of energy,\" Genarobegan. \"For instance, he never had any problems having sex because he hadbushels of energy. But he took one look at me and prescribed right away that mypeter was just for peeing. He told me that I didn't have enough energy to havesex. He said that my parents were too bored and too tired when they made me. Hesaid that I was the result of very boring sex, cojida aburrida. I was born likethat, bored and tired. The nagual Julian recommended that people like me shouldnever have sex. This way we can store the little energy we have.\"He said the same thing to Silvio Manuel and to Emilito. He saw that the othershad enough energy. They were not the result of bored sex. He told them that theycould do anything they wanted with their sexual energy, but he recommended thatthey control themselves; and understand the Eagle's command that sex is forbestowing the glow of awareness. We all said we had understood.\"One day, without any warning at all, he opened the curtain of the other worldwith the help of his own benefactor, the nagual Elias, and pushed all of usinside with no hesitation whatsoever. All of us, except Silvio Manuel, nearlydied in there. We had no energy to withstand the impact of the other world. Noneof us, except Silvio Manuel, had followed the nagual's recommendation.\"\"What is the curtain of the other world?\" I asked don Juan.\"What Genaro said. It is a curtain,\" don Juan replied. \"But you're getting offthe subject. You always do.\"We're talking about the Eagle's command about sex. It is the Eagle's commandthat sexual energy be used for creating life. Through sexual energy, the eaglebestows awareness. So when sentient beings are engaged in sexual intercourse,the emanations inside their cocoons do their best to bestow awareness to the newsentient being they are creating.\"Don Juan said that during the sexual act, the emanations encased inside thecocoon of both partners undergo a profound agitation. The culminating point is amerging; a fusing of two pieces of the glow of awareness, one from each partner,that separate from their cocoons.\"Sexual intercourse is always a bestowal of awareness even though the bestowalmay not be consolidated,\" don Juan went on. \"The emanations inside the cocoon ofhuman beings don't know of intercourse for fun.\"Genaro leaned over toward me from his chair across the table and talked to me ina low voice, shaking his head for emphasis.\"The nagual is telling you the truth,\" he said and winked at me. \"Thoseemanations really don't know.\"Don Juan fought not to laugh and added that the fallacy of man is to act withtotal disregard for the mystery of existence, and to believe that such a sublimeact of bestowing life and awareness is merely a physical drive that one cantwist at will.Genaro made obscene sexual gestures, twisting his pelvis around, on and on. DonJuan nodded and said that that was exactly what he meant. Genaro thanked him foracknowledging his one and only contribution to the explanation of awareness.Both of them laughed like idiots, saying that if I had known how serious theirbenefactor was about the explanation of awareness, I would be laughing withthem.I earnestly asked don Juan what all this meant for an average man in theday-to-day world.\"You mean what Genaro is doing?\" he asked me in mock seriousness.Their glee was always contagious. It took a long time for them to calm down.Their level of energy was so high, that next to them I seemed old and decrepit.\"I really don't know,\" don Juan finally answered me. \"All I know is what itmeans to warriors. They know that the only real energy we possess is alife-bestowing sexual energy. This knowledge makes them permanently conscious oftheir responsibility.\"If warriors want to have enough energy to see, they must become misers withtheir sexual energy. That was the lesson the nagual Julian gave us. He pushed usinto the unknown, and we all nearly died. Since everyone of us wanted to see,we, of course, abstained from wasting our glow of awareness.\"I had heard him voice that belief before. Every time he did we got into anargument. I always felt compelled to protest, and raise objections to what Ithought was a puritanical attitude toward sex.I again raised my objections. Both of them laughed to tears.\"What can be done with man's natural sensuality?\" I asked don Juan.\"Nothing,\" he replied. \"There is nothing wrong with man's sensuality. It's man'signorance of and disregard for his magical nature that is wrong. It's a mistaketo waste recklessly the life-bestowing force of sex and not have children, butit's also a mistake not to know that in having children one taxes the glow ofawareness.\"\"How do seers know that having children taxes the glow of awareness?\" I asked.\"They see that on having a child, the parents' glow of awareness diminishes andthe child's increases. In some supersensitive, frail parents, the glow ofawareness almost disappears. As children enhance their awareness, a big darkspot develops in the luminous cocoon of the parents on the very place from whichthe glow was taken away. It is usually on the midsection of the cocoon.Sometimes those spots can even be seen superimposed on the body itself.\"I asked him if there was anything that could be done to give people a morebalanced understanding of the glow of awareness.\"Nothing,\" he said. \"At least, there is nothing that seers can do. Seers aim tobe free- to be unbiased witnesses incapable of passing judgment. Otherwise theywould have to assume the responsibility for bringing about a more adjustedcycle. No one can do that. The new cycle, if it is to come, must come ofitself.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"5. The First AttentionThe following day we ate breakfast at dawn. Then don Juan made me shift levelsof awareness.\"Today, let's go to an original setting,\" don Juan said to Genaro.\"By all means,\" Genaro said gravely. He glanced at me, and then added in a lowvoice as if not wanting me to overhear him, \"Does he have to... perhaps it's toomuch...\"In a matter of seconds my fear and suspicion escalated to unbearable heights. Iwas sweating and panting. Don Juan came to my side and, with an expression ofalmost uncontrollable amusement he assured me that Genaro was just entertaininghimself at my expense.Don Juan said that we were going to a place where the original seers had livedthousands of years ago. As don Juan was speaking to me, I happened to glance atGenaro.He slowly shook his head from side to side. It was an almost imperceptiblegesture, as if he were letting me know that don Juan was not telling the truth.I went into a state of nervous frenzy, near hysteria- and stopped only whenGenaro burst into laughter.I marveled how easily my emotional states could escalate to nearly unmanageableheights or drop to nothing. Don Juan, Genaro, and I left Genaro's house in the early morning and traveled ashort distance into the surrounding eroded hills. Presently we stopped and satdown on top of an enormous flat rock, on a gradual slope, in a corn field thatseemed to have been recently harvested.\"This is the original setting,\" don Juan said to me. \"We'll come back here acouple of more times during the course of my explanation.\"\"Very weird things happen here at night,\" Genaro said. \"The nagual Julianactually caught an ally here. Or rather, the ally...\"Don Juan made a noticeable gesture with his eyebrows, and Genaro stopped inmidsentence. He smiled at me.\"It's too early in the day for scary stories,\" Genaro said. \"Let's wait untildark.\"He stood up and began creeping all around the rock, tiptoeing with his spinearched backward.\"What was he saying about your benefactor's catching an ally here?\" I asked donJuan.He did not answer right away. He was ecstatic, watching Genaro's antics.\"He was referring to some sophisticated use of awareness,\" he finally replied,still staring at Genaro.Genaro completed a circle around the rock and came back and sat down by me. Hewas panting heavily, almost wheezing, out of breath.Don Juan seemed fascinated by what Genaro had done. Again I had the feeling thatthey were amusing themselves at my expense; that both of them were up tosomething I knew nothing about.Suddenly, don Juan began his explanation. His voice soothed me. He said thatafter much toiling, seers arrived at the conclusion that the consciousness ofadult human beings, matured by the process of growth, can no longer be calledawareness because it has been modified into something more intense and complexwhich seers call attention.\"How do seers know that man's awareness is being cultivated and that it grows?\"I asked.He said that at a given time in the growth of human beings, a band of theemanations inside their cocoons becomes very bright. As human beings accumulateexperience, it begins to glow. In some instances, the glow of this band ofemanations increases so dramatically that it fuses with the emanations from theoutside. Seers, witnessing an enhancement of this kind, had to surmise thatawareness is the raw material and attention the end product of maturation.\"How do seers describe attention?\" I asked.\"They say that attention is the harnessing and enhancing of awareness throughthe process of being alive,\" he replied.He said that the danger of definitions is that they simplify matters to makethem understandable. In this case, in defining attention one runs the risk oftransforming a magical, miraculous accomplishment into something commonplace.\"Attention is man's greatest single accomplishment. It develops from raw animalawareness until it covers the entire gamut of human alternatives. Seers perfectit even further until it covers the whole scope of human possibilities.\"I wanted to know if in the seers' view there was a special significance of ournormal alternatives versus our other human possibilities.Don Juan replied that human alternatives are everything we are capable ofchoosing as persons. They have to do with the level of our day-to-day range, theknown; and owing to that fact, they are quite limited in number and scope.Human possibilities belong to the unknown. They are not what we are capable ofchoosing but what we are capable of attaining.He said that an example of human alternatives is our choice to believe that thehuman body is an object among objects. An example of human possibilities is theseers' achievement in viewing man as an egglike luminous being. With the body asan object one tackles the known, with the body as a luminous egg one tackles theunknown. Human possibilities have, therefore, nearly an inexhaustible scope.\"Seers say that there are three types of attention,\" don Juan went on. \"Whenthey say that, they mean it just for human beings, not for all the sentientbeings in existence. But the three are not just types of attention, they arerather three levels of attainment. They are the first, second, and thirdattention; each of them an independent domain; complete in itself.\"He explained that the first attention in man is animal awareness which has beendeveloped through the process of experience into a complex, intricate, andextremely fragile faculty that takes care of the day-to-day world in all itsinnumerable aspects. In other words, everything that one can think about is partof the first attention.\"The first attention is everything we are as average men,\" he continued. \"Byvirtue of such an absolute rule over our lives, the first attention is the mostvaluable asset that the average man has. Perhaps it is even our only asset.\"Taking into account its true value, the new seers started a rigorousexamination of the first attention through seeing. Their findings molded theirtotal outlook; and the outlook of all their descendants even though most oftheir descendants do not understand what those seers really saw.\"He emphatically warned me that the conclusions of the new seers' rigorousexamination had very little to do with reason or rationality because in order toexamine and explain the first attention, one must see it. Only seers can dothat.Yet, to examine what seers see in the first attention is essential. It allowsthe first attention the only opportunity it will ever have to realize its ownworkings.\"In terms of what seers see, the first attention is the glow of awarenessdeveloped to an ultra shine,\" he continued. \"But it is a glow fixed on thesurface of the cocoon, so to speak. It is a glow that covers the known.\"The second attention, on the other hand, is a more complex and specializedstate of the glow of awareness. It has to do with the unknown. It comes aboutwhen unused emanations inside man's cocoon are utilized.\"The reason I called the second attention specialized is that in order toutilize those unused emanations, one needs uncommon, elaborate tactics thatrequire supreme discipline and concentration.\"He said that he had told me before when he was teaching me the art of dreaming,that the concentration needed to be aware that one is having a dream is theforerunner of the second attention. That concentration is a form ofconsciousness that is not in the same category as the consciousness needed todeal with the daily world.He said that the second attention is also called the left-side awareness; and itis the vastest field that one can imagine, so vast in fact, that it seemslimitless.\"I wouldn't stray into it for anything in this world,\" he went on. \"It is aquagmire so complex and bizarre that sober seers go into it only under thestrictest conditions.\"The great difficulty is that the entrance into the second attention is utterlyeasy, and its lure is nearly irresistible.\"He said that the old seers, being the masters of awareness, applied theirexpertise to their own glows of awareness and made them expand to inconceivablelimits. They actually aimed at lighting up all the emanations inside theircocoons one band at a time. They succeeded, but oddly enough the accomplishmentof lighting up one band at a time was instrumental in their becoming imprisonedin the quagmire of the second attention.\"The new seers corrected that error,\" he continued, \"and let the mastery ofawareness develop to its natural end; which is to extend the glow of awarenessbeyond the bounds of the luminous cocoon in one single stroke.\"The third attention is attained when the glow of awareness turns into the firefrom within; a glow that kindles, not one band at a time, but all the Eagle'semanations inside man's cocoon.\"Don Juan expressed his awe for the new seers' deliberate effort to attain thethird attention while they are alive and conscious of their individuality.Don Juan did not consider it worthwhile to discuss the random cases of men andother sentient beings who enter into the unknown and the unknowable withoutbeing aware of it.He referred to these cases as the Eagle's gift.He asserted that for the new seers to enter into the third attention is also agift, but has a different meaning. It is more like a reward for an attainment.He added that at the moment of dying all human beings enter into the unknowableand some of them do attain the third attention; but altogether too briefly andonly to purify the food for the Eagle.\"The supreme accomplishment of human beings,\" he said, \"is to attain that levelof attention while retaining the life-force; without becoming a disembodiedawareness moving like a flicker of light up to the Eagle's beak to be devoured.\"While listening to don Juan's explanation I had again completely lost sight ofeverything that surrounded me. Genaro apparently had gotten up and left us, andwas nowhere in sight.Strangely, I found myself crouching on the rock with don Juan squatting by meholding me down by gently pushing on my shoulders. I reclined on the rock andclosed my eyes. There was a soft breeze blowing from the west.\"Don't fall asleep,\" don Juan said. \"Not for any reason should you fall asleepon this rock.\"I sat up. Don Juan was staring at me.\"Just relax,\" he went on. \"Let the internal dialogue die out.\"All my concentration was involved in following what he was saying when I got ajolt of fright. I did not know what it was at first. I thought I was goingthrough another attack of distrust.But then it struck me, like a bolt, that it was very late in the afternoon. WhatI had thought was an hour's conversation had consumed an entire day.I jumped up, fully aware of the incongruity, although I could not conceive whathad happened to me. I felt a strange sensation that made my body want to run.Don Juan jumped me, restraining me forcefully. We fell to the soft ground, andhe held me there with an iron grip. I had had no idea that don Juan was sostrong.My body shook violently. My arms flew every which way as they shook. I washaving something like a seizure. Yet some part of me was detached to the pointof becoming fascinated with watching my body vibrate, twist, and shake.The spasms finally died out and don Juan let go of me. He was panting with theexertion. He recommended that we climb back up on the rock and sit there until Iwas all right.I could not help pressing him with my usual question: What had happened to me?He answered that as he talked to me I had pushed beyond a certain limit, and hadentered very deeply into the left side. He and Genaro had followed me in there.And then I had rushed out in the same fashion I had rushed in.\"I caught you right on time,\" he said. \"Otherwise you would have gone straightout to your normal self.\"I was totally confused. He explained that the three of us had been playing withawareness. I must have gotten scared and run out on them.\"Genaro is the master of awareness,\" don Juan went on. \"Silvio Manuel is themaster of will. The two of them were mercilessly pushed into the unknown. Mybenefactor did to them what his benefactor did to him. Genaro and Silvio Manuelare very much like the old seers in some respects. They know what they can do,but they don't care to know how they do it. Today, Genaro seized the opportunityto push your glow of awareness and we all ended up in the weird confines of theunknown.\"I begged him to tell me what had happened in the unknown.\"You'll have to remember that yourself,\" a voice said just by my ear.I was so convinced that it was the voice of seeing that it did not frighten meat all. I did not even obey the impulse to turn around.\"I am the voice of seeing and I tell you that you are a peckerhead,\" the voicesaid again and chuckled.I turned around. Genaro was sitting behind me. I was so surprised that I laughedperhaps a bit more hysterically than they did.\"It's getting dark now,\" Genaro said to me. \"As I promised you earlier today, weare going to have a ball here.\"Don Juan intervened and said that we should stop for the day, because I was thekind of nincompoop who could die of fright.\"Nah, he's all right,\" Genaro said, patting me on the shoulder.\"You'd better ask him,\" don Juan said to Genaro. \"He himself will tell you thathe's that kind of nincompoop.\"\"Are you really that kind of nincompoop?\" Genaro asked me with a frown.I didn't answer him. And that made them roll around laughing. Genaro rolled allthe way to the ground.Don Juan swiftly jumped down, and helped him to stand up.Genaro, referring to me, said to don Juan, \"He's caught. He'll never say he's anincompoop. He's too self-important for that, but he's shivering in his pantswith fear of what might happen because he didn't confess he's a nincompoop.\"Watching them laugh, I was convinced that only Indians could laugh with suchjoyfulness. But I also became convinced that there was a mile-wide streak ofmaliciousness in them. They were poking fun at a non-Indian.Don Juan immediately caught my feelings.\"Don't let your self-importance run rampant,\" he said. \"You're not special byany standards. None of us are, Indians and non-Indians. The nagual Julian andhis benefactor added years of enjoyment to their lives laughing at us.\"Genaro nimbly climbed back onto the rock and came to my side.\"If I were you, I'd feel so frigging embarrassed I'd cry,\" he said to me. \"Cry,cry. Have a good cry and you'll feel better.\"To my utter amazement I began to weep softly. Then I got so angry that I roaredwith fury. Only then I felt better.Don Juan patted my back gently. He said that usually anger is very sobering; orsometimes fear is, or humor. My violent nature made me respond only to anger.He added that a sudden shift in the glow of awareness makes us weak. They hadbeen trying to reinforce me, to bolster me. Apparently Genaro had succeeded bymaking me rage.It was twilight by then. Suddenly Genaro pointed to a flicker in midair at eyelevel in the twilight. It appeared to be a large moth flying around the placewhere we sat.\"Be very gentle with your exaggerated nature,\" don Juan said to me. \"Don't beeager. Just let Genaro guide you. Don't take your eyes from that spot.\"The flickering point was definitely a moth. I could clearly distinguish all itsfeatures. I followed its convoluted, tired flight, until I could see every speckof dust on its wings.Something got me out of my total absorption. I sensed a flurry of soundlessnoise, if that could be possible, just behind me. I turned around and caughtsight of an entire row of people on the other edge of the rock; an edge that wasa bit higher than the one on which we were sitting. I supposed that the peoplewho lived nearby must have gotten suspicious of us hanging around all day andhad climbed onto the rock intending to harm us. I knew about their intentionsinstantly.Don Juan and Genaro slid down from the rock and told me to hurry down. We leftimmediately without turning back to see if the men were following us. Don Juanand Genaro refused to talk while we walked back to Genaro's house. Don Juan evenmade me hush with a fierce grunt, putting his finger to his lips. Genaro did notcome into the house, but kept on walking as don Juan dragged me inside.\"Who were those people, don Juan?\" I asked him, when the two of us were safelyinside the house and he had lit the lantern.\"They were not people,\" he replied.\"Come on, don Juan, don't mystify me,\" I said. \"They were men. I saw them withmy own eyes.\"\"Of course, you saw them with your own eyes,\" he retorted, \"but that doesn't sayanything. Your eyes misled you. Those were not people, and they were followingyou. Genaro had to draw them away from you.\"\"What were they, then, if not people?\"\"Oh, there is the mystery,\" he said. \"It's a mystery of awareness and it can'tbe solved rationally by talking about it. The mystery can only be witnessed.\"\"Let me witness it then.\" I said.\"But you already have twice in one day,\" he said. \"You don't remember now. Youwill, however, when you rekindle the emanations that were glowing when youwitnessed the mystery of awareness I'm referring to. In the meantime, let's goback to our explanation of awareness.\"He reiterated that awareness begins with the permanent pressure that theemanations at large exert on the ones trapped inside the cocoon. This pressureproduces the first act of consciousness. It stops the motion of the trappedemanations which are fighting to break the cocoon; fighting to die.\"For a seer, the truth is that all living beings are struggling to die,\" he wenton. \"What stops death is awareness.\"Don Juan said that the new seers were profoundly disturbed by the fact thatawareness forestalls death, while at the same time awareness induces it by beingfood for the Eagle. Since they could not explain it, for there is no rationalway to understand existence, seers realized that their knowledge is composed ofcontradictory propositions.\"Why did they develop a system of contradictions?\" I asked.\"They didn't develop anything,\" he said. \"They found unquestionable truths bymeans of their seeing. Those truths are arranged in terms of supposedly blatantcontradictions, that's all.\"For example, seers have to be methodical, rational beings, paragons ofsobriety; and at the same time they must shy away from all of those qualities inorder to be completely free and open to the wonders and mysteries of existence.\"His example left me baffled, but not to the extreme. I understood what he meant.He himself had sponsored my rationality only to crush it and demand a totalabsence of it. I told him how I understood his point.\"Only a feeling of supreme sobriety can bridge the contradictions,\" he said.\"Could you say, don Juan, that art is that bridge?\"\"You may call the bridge between contradictions anything you want- art,affection, sobriety, love, or even kindness.\"Don Juan continued his explanation and said that in examining the firstattention, the new seers realized that all organic beings, except man, quietdown their agitated trapped emanations so that those emanations can alignthemselves with their matching ones outside.Human beings do not do that. Instead, their first attention lakes an inventoryof the Eagle's emanations inside their cocoons.\"What is an inventory, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Human beings take notice of the emanations they have inside their cocoons,\" hereplied. \"No other creatures do that. In humans, the moment the pressure fromthe emanations at large fixates the emanations inside, the first attentionbegins to watch itself. It notes everything about itself, or at least it triesto, in whatever aberrant ways it can. This is the process seers call taking aninventory.\"I don't mean to say that human beings choose to take an inventory, or that theycan refuse to take it. To take an inventory is the Eagle's command. What issubject to volition, [* volition- the capability of conscious choice anddecision and intention] however, is the manner in which the command is obeyed.\"He said that although he disliked calling the emanations commands, that is whatthey are; commands that no one can disobey. Yet the way out of obeying thecommands is in obeying them.\"In the case of the inventory of the first attention,\" he went on, \"seers takeit, for they can't disobey. But once they have taken it they throw it away. TheEagle doesn't command us to worship our inventory. It commands us to take it,that's all.\"\"How do seers see that man takes an inventory?\" I asked.\"The emanations inside the cocoon of man are not quieted down for purposes ofmatching them with those outside,\" he replied. \"This is evident after seeingwhat other creatures do. On quieting down, some of the other creatures actuallymerge themselves with the emanations at large and move with them. Seers can see,for instance, the light of the scarabs' emanations expanding to great size.\"But human beings quiet down their emanations and then reflect on them. Theemanations focus on themselves.\"He said that human beings carry the command of taking an inventory to itslogical extreme and disregard everything else. Once they are deeply involved inthe inventory, one of two things normally happens. They may ignore the impulsesof the emanations at large, or they may use them in a very specialized way.The end result of ignoring those impulses after taking an inventory is a uniquestate known as reason. The result of using every impulse in a specialized way isknown as self-absorption.Human reason appears to a seer as an unusually homogeneous dull glow that rarelyif ever responds to the constant pressure from the emanations at large- a glowthat makes the egglike shell become tougher, but more brittle.Don Juan remarked that reason in the human species should be bountiful, but thatin actuality it is very rare. The majority of human beings turn toself-absorption.He asserted that the awareness of all living beings has a degree ofself-reflection in order for them to interact. But none except man's firstattention has such a degree of self-absorption. Contrary to men of reason whoignore the impulse of the emanations at large, the self-absorbed individuals useevery impulse and turn them all into a force to stir the trapped emanationsinside their cocoons.Observing all this, seers arrived at a practical conclusion. They saw that menof reason are bound to live longer, because by disregarding the impulse of theemanations at large, they quiet down the natural agitation inside their cocoons.The self-absorbed individuals, on the other hand, by using the impulse of theemanations at large to create more agitation, shorten their lives.\"What do seers see when they gaze at self-absorbed human beings?\" I asked.\"They see them as intermittent bursts of white light, followed by long pauses ofdullness,\" he said.Don Juan stopped talking. I had no more questions to ask, or perhaps I was tootired to ask about anything. There was a loud bang that made me jump. The frontdoor flew open and Genaro came in, out of breath. He slumped on the mat. He wasactually covered with perspiration.\"I was explaining about the first attention,\" don Juan said to him.\"The first attention works only with the known,\" Genaro said. \"it isn't worthtwo plugged nickels with the unknown.\"\"That is not quite right,\" don Juan retorted. \"The first attention works verywell with the unknown. It blocks it. It denies it so fiercely that in the end,the unknown doesn't exist for the first attention.\"Taking an inventory makes us invulnerable. That is why the inventory came intoexistence in the first place.\"\"What are you talking about?\" I asked don Juan.He didn't reply. He looked at Genaro as if waiting for an answer.\"But if I open the door,\" Genaro said, \"would the first attention be capable ofdealing with what will come in?\"\"Yours and mine wouldn't, but his will,\" don Juan said, pointing at me. \"Let'stry it.\"\"Even though he's in heightened awareness?\" Genaro asked don Juan.\"That won't make any difference,\" don Juan answered.Genaro got up and went to the front door and threw it open. He instantly jumpedback. A gust of cold wind came in. Don Juan came to my side, and so did Genaro.Both of them looked at me in amazement.I wanted to close the front door. The cold was making me uncomfortable. But as Imoved toward the door, don Juan and Genaro jumped in front of me and shieldedme.\"Do you notice anything in the room?\" Genaro asked me.\"No, I don't,\" I said, and I really meant it.Except for the cold wind pouring in through the open door, there was nothing tonotice in there.\"Weird creatures came in when I opened the door,\" he said. \"Don't you noticeanything?\"There was something in his voice that told me he was not joking this time.The three of us, with both of them flanking me, walked out of the house. DonJuan picked up the kerosene lantern, and Genaro locked the front door. We gotinside the car, through the passenger's side. They pushed me in first. And thenwe drove to don Juan's house in the next town. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"6. Inorganic BeingsThe next day I repeatedly asked don Juan to explain our hasty departure fromGenaro's house. He refused even to mention the incident. Genaro was no helpeither. Every time I asked him he winked at me, grinning like a fool.In the afternoon, don Juan came to the back patio of his house where I wastalking with his apprentices. As if on cue, all the young apprentices leftinstantly.Don Juan took me by the arm, and we began to walk along the corridor. He did notsay anything. For a while we just strolled around, very much as if we were inthe public square.Don Juan stopped walking and turned to me. He circled me, looking over my entirebody. I knew that he was seeing me. I felt a strange fatigue, a laziness I hadnot felt until his eyes swept over me. He began to talk all of a sudden.\"The reason Genaro and I didn't want to focus on what happened last night,\" hesaid, \"was that you had been very frightened during the time you were in theunknown. Genaro pushed you, and things happened to you in there.\"\"What things, don Juan?\"\"Things that are still difficult if not impossible to explain to you now,\" hesaid. \"You don't have enough surplus energy to enter into the unknown and makesense of it. When the new seers arranged the order of the truths aboutawareness, they saw that the first attention consumes all the glow of awarenessthat human beings have, and not an iota of energy is left free. That's yourproblem now. So, the new seers proposed that warriors, since they have to enterinto the unknown, have to save their energy. But where are they going to getenergy, if all of it is taken? They'll get it, the new seers say, fromeradicating unnecessary habits.\"He stopped talking and solicited questions. I asked him what eradicatingunnecessary habits did to the glow of awareness.He replied that it detaches awareness from self-reflection and allows it thefreedom to focus on something else.\"The unknown is forever present,\" he continued, \"but it is outside thepossibility of our normal awareness. The unknown is the superfluous part of theaverage man. And it is superfluous because the average man doesn't have enoughfree energy to grasp it.\"After all the time you've spent in the warrior's path, you have enough freeenergy to grasp the unknown, but not enough energy to understand it or even toremember it.\"He explained that at the site of the flat rock, I had entered very deeply intothe unknown. But I indulged in my exaggerated nature and became terrified; whichwas about the worst thing anyone can do. So I had rushed out of the left side,like a bat out of hell; unfortunately, taking a legion of strange things withme.I told don Juan that he was not getting to the point; that he should come outand tell me exactly what he meant by a legion of strange things.He took me by the arm and continued strolling around with me.\"In explaining awareness,\" he said, \"I am presumably fitting everything ornearly everything into place. Let's talk a little bit about the old seers.Genaro, as I've told you, is very much like them.\"He led me then to the big room. We sat down there and he began his elucidation.\"The new seers were simply terrified by the knowledge that the old seers hadaccumulated over the years,\" don Juan said. \"It's understandable. The new seersknew that that knowledge leads only to total destruction. Yet they were alsofascinated by it, especially by the practices.\"\"How did the new seers know about those practices?\" I asked.\"They are the legacy of the old Toltecs,\" he said. \"The new seers learn aboutthem as they go along. They hardly ever use them, but the practices are there aspart of their knowledge.\"\"What kind of practices are they, don Juan?\"\"They are very obscure formulas, incantations, lengthy procedures that have todo with the handling of a very mysterious force. At least it was mysterious tothe ancient Toltecs who masked it and made it more horrifying than it reallyis.\"\"What is that mysterious force?\" I asked.\"It's a force that is present throughout everything there is,\" he said. \"The oldseers never attempted to unravel the mystery of the force that made them createtheir secret practices. They simply accepted it as something sacred. But the newseers took a close look and called it will; the will of the Eagle's emanations,or intent.\"Don Juan went on explaining that the ancient Toltecs had divided their secretknowledge into five sets of two categories each: the earth and the dark regions,fire and water, the above and the below, the loud and the silent, the moving andthe stationary. He speculated that there must have been thousands of differenttechniques which became more and more intricate as time passed.\"The secret knowledge of the earth,\" he went on, \"had to do with everything thatstands on the ground. There were particular sets of movements, words, unguents,and potions that were applied to people, animals, insects, trees, small plants,rocks, or soil.\"These were techniques that made the old seers into horrid beings. And theirsecret knowledge of the earth was employed either to groom or to destroyanything that stands on the ground.\"The counterpart of the earth was what they knew as the dark regions. Thesepractices were by far the most dangerous. They dealt with entities withoutorganic life. Living creatures that are present on the earth and populate ittogether with all organic beings.\"Doubtlessly, one of the most worthwhile findings of the ancient seers,especially for them, was the discovery that organic life is not the only form oflife present on this earth.\"I did not quite comprehend what he had said. I waited for him to clarify hisstatements.\"Organic beings are not the only creatures that have life,\" he said and pausedagain as if to allow me time to think his statements over.I countered with a long argument about the definition of life and being alive. Italked about reproduction, metabolism, and growth, the processes thatdistinguish live organisms from inanimate things.\"You're drawing from the organic,\" he said. \"But that's only one instance. Youshouldn't draw all you have to say from one category alone.\"\"But how else can it be?\" I asked.\"For seers, to be alive means to be aware,\" he replied. \"For the average man, tobe aware means to be an organism. This is where seers are different. For them,to be aware means that the emanations that cause awareness are encased inside areceptacle.\"Organic living beings have a cocoon that encloses the emanations. But there areother creatures whose receptacles don't look like a cocoon to a seer. Yet theyhave the emanations of awareness in them and characteristics of life other thanreproduction and metabolism.\"\"Such as what, don Juan?\"\"Such as emotional dependency, sadness, joy, wrath, and so forth and so on. AndI forgot the best yet, love; a kind of love man can't even conceive.\"\"Are you serious, don Juan?\" I asked in earnest.\"Inanimately serious,\" he answered with a deadpan expression and then broke intolaughter.\"If we take as our clue what seers see,\" he continued, \"life is indeedextraordinary.\"\"If those beings are alive, why don't they make themselves known to man?\" Iasked.\"They do, all the time. And not only to seers but also to the average man. Theproblem is that all the energy available to the average man is consumed by thefirst attention. A man's inventory not only takes it all, but it also toughensthe cocoon to the point of making it inflexible. Under those circumstances thereis no possible interaction.\"He reminded me of the countless times in the course of my apprenticeship withhim when I had had a firsthand view of inorganic beings. I retorted that I hadexplained away nearly every one of those instances.I had even formulated the hypothesis that his teachings, through the use ofhallucinogenic plants, were geared to force an agreement on the part of theapprentice about a primitive interpretation of the world.I told him that I had not formally called it a primitive interpretation, but inanthropological terms I had labeled it a 'world view more proper to hunting andgathering societies'.Don Juan laughed until he was out of breath.\"I really don't know whether you're worse in your normal state of awareness orin a heightened one,\" he said. \"In your normal state you're not suspicious, butboringly reasonable. I think I like you best when you are way inside the leftside, in spite of the fact that you are terribly afraid of everything, as youwere yesterday.\"Before I had time to say anything at all, he stated that he was pitting what theold seers did against the accomplishments of the new seers as a sort ofcounterpoint with which he intended to give me a more inclusive view of the oddsI was up against.He continued then with his elucidation of the practices of the old seers. Hesaid that another of their great findings had to do with the next category ofsecret knowledge: fire and water. They discovered that flames have a mostpeculiar quality. They can transport man bodily, just as water does.Don Juan called it a brilliant discovery. I remarked that there are basic lawsof physics that would prove that to be impossible. He asked me to wait until hehad explained everything before drawing any conclusions. He remarked that I hadto check my excessive rationality, because it constantly affected my states ofheightened awareness. It was not a case of reacting every which way to externalinfluences, but of succumbing to my own devices.He went on explaining that the ancient Toltecs, although they obviously saw, didnot understand what they saw. They merely used their findings without botheringto relate them to a larger picture. In the case of their category of fire andwater, they divided fire into heat and flame, and water into wetness andfluidity. They correlated heat and wetness and called them lesser properties.They considered flames and fluidity to be higher, magical properties, and theyused them as a means for bodily transportation to the realm of nonorganic life.Between their knowledge of that kind of life and their fire and water practices,the ancient seers became bogged down in a quagmire with no way out.Don Juan assured me that the new seers agreed that the discovery of nonorganicliving beings was indeed extraordinary, but not in the way the old seersbelieved it to be. To find themselves in a one-to-one relation with another kindof life gave the ancient seers a false feeling of invulnerability which spelledtheir doom.I wanted him to explain the fire and water techniques in greater detail. He saidthat the old seers' knowledge was as intricate as it was useless and that he wasonly going to outline it.Then he summarized the practices of the above and the below. The above dealtwith secret knowledge about wind, rain, sheets of lightning, clouds, thunder,daylight, and the sun. The knowledge of the below had to do with fog, water ofunderground springs, swamps, lightning bolts, earthquakes, the night, moonlight,and the moon.The loud and the silent were a category of secret knowledge that had to do withthe manipulation of sound and quiet. The moving and the stationary werepractices concerned with mysterious aspects of motion and motionlessness.I asked him if he could give me an example of any of the techniques he hadoutlined. He replied that he had already given me dozens of demonstrations overthe years. I insisted that I had rationally explained away everything he haddone to me.He did not answer. He seemed to be either angry at me for asking questions orseriously involved in searching for a good example. After a while he smiled andsaid that he had visualized the proper example.\"The technique I have in mind has to be put in action in the shallow depths of astream,\" he said. \"There is one near Genaro's house.\"\"What will I have to do?\"\"You'll have to get a medium-size mirror.\"I was surprised at his request. I remarked that the ancient Toltecs did not knowabout mirrors.\"They didn't,\" he admitted, smiling. \"This is my benefactor's addition to thetechnique. All the ancient seers needed was a reflecting surface.\"He explained that the technique consisted of submerging a shiny surface into theshallow water of a stream. The surface could be any flat object that had somecapacity to reflect images.\"I want you to construct a solid frame made of sheet metal for a medium-sizemirror,\" he said. \"it has to be waterproof, so you must seal it with tar. Youmust make it yourself with your own hands. When you have made it, bring it overand we'll proceed.\"\"What's going to happen, don Juan?\"\"Don't be apprehensive. You yourself have asked me to give you an example of anancient Toltec practice. I asked the same thing of my benefactor. I thinkeverybody asks for one at a certain moment. My benefactor said that he did thesame thing himself. His benefactor, the nagual Elias, gave him an example. Mybenefactor in turn gave the same one to me, and now I am going to give it toyou.\"At the time my benefactor gave me the example I didn't know how he did it. Iknow now. Someday you yourself will also know how the technique works and youwill understand what's behind all this.\"I thought that don Juan wanted me to go back home to Los Angeles and constructthe frame for the mirror there. I commented that it would be impossible for meto remember the task if I did not remain in heightened awareness.\"There are two things out of kilter with your comment,\" he said. \"One is thatthere is no way for you to remain in heightened awareness and still functionunless I, or Genaro, or any of the warriors in the nagual's party nurse youevery minute of the day as I am now. The other is that Mexico is not the moon.There are hardware stores here. We can go to Oaxaca and buy anything you need.\"We drove to the city the next day and I bought all the pieces for the frame. Iassembled it myself in a mechanic's shop for a minimal fee. Don Juan told me toput it in the trunk of my car. He did not so much as glance at it.We drove back to Genaro's house in the late afternoon and arrived there in theearly morning. I looked for Genaro. He was not there. The house seemed deserted.\"Why does Genaro keep this house?\" I asked don Juan. \"He lives with you, doesn'the?\"Don Juan did not answer. He gave me a strange look and went to light thekerosene lantern. I was alone in the room in total darkness. I felt a greattiredness that I attributed to the long, tortuous drive up the mountains. Iwanted to lie down. In the darkness, I could not see where Genaro had put themats. I stumbled over a pile of them.And then I knew why Genaro kept that house. He took care of the male apprenticesPablito, Nestor, and Benigno who lived there when they were in their state ofnormal awareness.I felt exhilarated. I was no longer tired. Don Juan came in with a lantern. Itold him about my realization, but he said that it did not matter; that I wouldnot remember it for too long.He asked me to show him the mirror. He seemed pleased, and remarked about itsbeing light yet solid. He noticed that I had used metal screws to affix analuminum frame to a piece of sheet metal that I had used as a backing for amirror eighteen inches long by fourteen inches wide.\"I made a wooden frame for my mirror,\" he said. \"This looks much better thanmine. My frame was too cumbersome and at the same time frail.\"Let me explain what we're going to do,\" he continued after he had finishedexamining the mirror. \"Or perhaps I should say, what we're going to attempt todo. The two of us together are going to place this mirror on the surface of thestream near the house. It is wide enough and shallow enough to serve ourpurposes.\"The idea is to let the fluidity of the water exert pressure on us and transportus away.\"Before I could make any remarks or ask any questions, he reminded me that in thepast I had utilized the water of a similar stream and accomplished extraordinaryfeats of perception. He was referring to the aftereffects of ingestinghallucinogenic plants; effects which I had experienced various times while beingsubmerged in the irrigation ditch behind his house in northern Mexico.\"Save any questions until I explain to you what the seers knew about awareness,\"he said. \"Then you'll understand everything we're doing in a different light.But first let's go on with our procedure.\" We walked to the nearby stream, and he selected a place with flat, exposedrocks. He said that there the water was shallow enough for our purposes.\"What do you expect to happen?\" I asked in the midst of a gripping apprehension.\"I don't know. All I know is what we are going to attempt. We will hold themirror very carefully, but very firmly. We will gently place it on the surfaceof the water and then let it submerge. We will then hold it on the bottom. I'vechecked it. There is enough silt there to allow us to dig our fingers underneaththe mirror to hold it firmly.\"He asked me to squat on a flat rock above the surface in the middle of thegentle stream and made me hold the mirror with both hands, almost at the cornerson one side. He squatted facing me and held the mirror the same way I did. Welet the mirror sink, and then we held it by plunging our arms in the wateralmost to our elbows.He commanded me to empty myself of thoughts and stare at the surface of themirror. He repeated over and over that the trick was not to think at all. Ilooked intently into the mirror. The gentle current mildly disarranged thereflection of don Juan's face and mine.After a few minutes of steady gazing into the mirror it seemed to me thatgradually the image of his face and mine became much clearer. And the mirrorgrew in size until it was at least a yard square. The current seemed to havestopped, and the mirror looked as clear as if it were placed on top of thewater. Even more odd was the crispness of our reflections, it was as if my facehad been magnified, not in size but in focus. I could see the pores in the skinof my forehead.Don Juan gently whispered not to stare at my eyes or his, but to let my gazewander around without focusing on any part of our reflections.\"Gaze fixedly without staring!\" he repeatedly ordered in a forceful whisper.I did what he said without stopping to ponder about the seeming contradiction.At that moment something inside me was caught in that mirror, and thecontradiction actually made sense. \"It is possible to gaze fixedly withoutstaring,\" I thought, and the instant that thought was formulated another headappeared next to don Juan's and mine. It was on the lower side of the mirror, tomy left.My whole body trembled. Don Juan whispered to calm down and not show fear orsurprise. He again commanded me to gaze without staring at the newcomer. I hadto make an unimaginable effort not to gasp and release the mirror. My body wasshaking from head to toe. Don Juan whispered again to get hold of myself. Henudged me repeatedly with his shoulder.Slowly I got my fear under control. I gazed at the third head and graduallyrealized that it was not a human head, or an animal head either. In fact, it wasnot a head at all. It was a shape that had no inner mobility. As the thoughtoccurred to me, I instantly realized that I was not thinking it myself. Therealization was not a thought either. I had a moment of tremendous anxiety andthen something incomprehensible became known to me. The thoughts were a voice inmy ear!\"I am seeing!\" I yelled in English, but there was no sound.\"Yes, you're seeing,\" the voice in my ear said in Spanish.I felt that I was encased in a force greater than myself. I was not in pain oreven anguished. I felt nothing. I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt, because thevoice was telling me so, that I could not break the grip of that force by an actof will or strength. I knew I was dying.I lifted my eyes automatically to look at don Juan, and at the instant our eyesmet the force let go of me. I was free. Don Juan was smiling at me as if he knewexactly what I had gone through.I realized that I was standing up. Don Juan was holding the mirror edgewise tolet the water drip off.We walked back to the house in silence.\"The ancient Toltecs were simply mesmerized by their findings,\" don Juan said.\"I can understand why,\" I said.\"So can I,\" don Juan retorted.The force that had enveloped me had been so powerful as to incapacitate me forspeech, or even for thought for hours afterward. It had frozen me with a totallack of volition. And I had thawed out only by tiny degrees.\"Without any deliberate intervention on our part,\" don Juan continued, \"thisancient Toltec technique has been divided into two parts for you. The first wasjust enough to familiarize you with what takes place. In the second, we will tryto accomplish what the old seers pursued.\"\"What really took place out there, don Juan?\" I asked.\"There are two versions. I'll give you the old seers' version first. Theythought that the reflecting surface of a shiny object submerged in waterenlarges the power of the water. What they used to do was gaze into bodies ofwater, and the reflecting surface served them as an aid to accelerate theprocess. They believed that our eyes are the keys to entering into the unknown.By gazing into water, they were allowing the eyes to open the way.\"Don Juan said that the old seers observed that the wetness of water only dampensor soaks, but that the fluidity of water moves. It runs, they surmised, insearch of other levels underneath us. They believed that water had been given tous not only for life, but also as a link; a road to the other levels below.\"Are there many levels below?\" I asked.\"The ancient seers counted seven levels,\" he replied.\"Do you know them yourself, don Juan?\"\"I am a seer of the new cycle, and consequently I have a different view,\" hesaid. \"I am just showing you what the old seers did and I'm telling you whatthey believed.\"He asserted that just because he had different views did not mean the old seers'practices were invalid. Their interpretations were wrong, but their truths hadpractical value for them.In the instance of the water practices, they were convinced that it was humanlypossible to be transported bodily by the fluidity of water anywhere between thislevel of ours and the other seven levels below; or to be transported in essenceanywhere on this level, along the watercourse of a river in either direction.They used, accordingly, running water to be transported on this level of oursand the water of deep lakes or that of waterholes to be transported to thedepths.\"What they pursued with the technique I'm showing you was twofold,\" he went on.\"On the one hand, they used the fluidity of the water to be transported to thefirst level below. On the other, they used it to have a face-to-face meetingwith a living being from that first level. The headlike shape in the mirror wasone of those creatures that came to look us over.\"\"So, they really exist!\" I exclaimed.\"They certainly do,\" he retorted.He said that ancient seers were damaged by their aberrant insistence on stayingglued to their procedures, but that whatever they found was valid. They foundout that the surest way to meet one of those creatures is through a body ofwater. The size of the body of water is not relevant. An ocean or a pond servesthe same purpose. He had chosen a small stream because he hated to get wet. Wecould have gotten the same results in a lake or a large river.\"The other life comes to find out what's going on when human beings call,\" hecontinued. \"That Toltec technique is like a knock on their door. The old seerssaid the shiny surface on the bottom of the water served as a bait and a window.So humans and those creatures meet at a window.\"\"Is that what happened to me there?\" I asked.\"The old seers would've said that you were being pulled by the power of thewater and the power of the first level, plus the magnetic influence of thecreature at the window.\"\"But I heard a voice in my ear saying that I was dying,\" I said.\"The voice was right. You were dying, and you would have if I hadn't been there.That is the danger of practicing the Toltecs' techniques. They are extremelyeffective, but most of the time they are deadly.\"I told him that I was ashamed to confess that I was terrified. Seeing that shapein the mirror, and having the sensation of an enveloping force around me hadproved too much for me the day before.\"I don't want to alarm you,\" he said, \"but nothing has happened to you yet. Ifwhat happened to me is going to be the guideline of what will happen to you,you'd better prepare yourself for the shock of your life. It's better to shakein your boots now than to die of fright tomorrow.\"My fear was so terrifying that I couldn't even voice the questions that came tomy mind. I had a hard lime swallowing. Don Juan laughed until he was coughing.His face got purple. When I got my voice back, every one of my questionsprompted another attack of coughing laughter.\"You have no idea how funny this all is to me,\" he finally said. \"I'm notlaughing at you. It's just the situation. My benefactor made me go through thesame motions, and looking at you I can't help seeing myself.\"I told him that I felt sick to my stomach. He said that that was fine, that itwas natural to be scared, and that to control fear was wrong and senseless. Theancient seers got trapped by suppressing their terror when they should have beenscared out of their wits. Since they did not want to stop their pursuits orabandon their comforting constructs, they controlled their fear instead.\"What else are we going to do with the mirror?\" I asked.\"That mirror is going to be used for a face-to-face meeting between you and thatcreature you only gazed at yesterday.\"\"What happens in a face-to-face meeting?\"\"What happens is that one form of life, the human form, meets another form oflife. The old seers said that in this case, it is a creature from the firstlevel of the fluidity of water.\"He explained that the ancient seers surmised that the seven levels below ourswere levels of the fluidity of water. For them a spring had untold significancebecause they thought that in such a case the fluidity of water is reversed andgoes from the depth to the surface. They took that to be the means wherebycreatures from other levels, these other forms of life, come to our plane topeer at us, to observe us.\"In this respect those old seers were not mistaken,\" he went on. \"They hit thenail right on the head. Entities that the new seers call allies do appear aroundwaterholes.\"\"Was the creature in the mirror an ally?\" I asked.\"Of course. But not one that can be utilized. The tradition of the allies, whichI have acquainted you with in the past, comes directly from the ancient seers.They did wonders with allies, but nothing they did was worth anything when thereal enemy came along: their fellow men.\"\"Since those creatures are allies, they must be very dangerous,\" I said.\"As dangerous as we men are, no more, no less.\"\"Can they kill us?\"\"Not directly, but they certainly can frighten us to death. They can cross theboundaries themselves, or they can just come to the window. As you may haverealized by now, the ancient Toltecs didn't stop at the window, either. Theyfound weird ways to go beyond it.\" The second stage of the technique proceeded very much as had the first exceptthat it took perhaps twice as long for me to relax and stop my internal turmoil.When that was done, the reflection of don Juan's face and mine became instantlyclear. I gazed from his reflection to mine for perhaps an hour.I expected the ally to appear any moment, but nothing happened. My neck hurt. Myback was stiff and my legs were numb. I wanted to kneel on the rock to relievethe pain in my lower back. Don Juan whispered that the moment the ally showedits shape my discomfort would vanish.He was absolutely right. The shock of witnessing a round shape appear on theedge of the mirror dispelled every discomfort of mine.\"What do we do now?\" I whispered.\"Relax and don't focus your gaze on anything, not even for an instant,\" hereplied. \"Watch everything that appears in the mirror. Gaze without staring.\"I obeyed him. I glanced at everything within the frame of the mirror. There wasa peculiar buzzing in my ears. Don Juan whispered that I should move my eyes ina clockwise direction if I felt that I was being enveloped by an unusual force;but under no circumstances, he stressed, should I lift my head to look at him.After a moment I noticed that the mirror was reflecting more than the reflectionof our faces and the round shape. Its surface had become dark. Spots of anintense violet light appeared. They grew large. There were also spots of jetblackness. Then it turned into something like a flat picture of a cloudy sky atnight, in the moonlight. Suddenly, the whole surface came into focus, as if itwere a moving picture. The new sight was a three-dimensional, breathtaking viewof the depths.I knew that it was absolutely impossible for me to fight off the tremendousattraction of that sight. It began to pull me in.Don Juan whispered forcefully that I should roll my eyes for dear life. Themovement brought immediate relief. I could again distinguish our reflections andthat of the ally. Then the ally disappeared and reappeared again on the otherend of the mirror.Don Juan commanded me to grip the mirror with all my might. He warned me to becalm and not make any sudden movements.\"What's going to happen?\" I whispered.\"The ally will try to come out,\" he replied.As soon as he had said that I felt a powerful tug. Something jerked my arms. Thetug was from underneath the mirror. It was like a suction force that created auniform pressure all around the frame.\"Hold the mirror tightly but don't break it,\" don Juan ordered. \"Fight thesuction. Don't let the ally sink the mirror too deep.\"The force pulling down on us was enormous. I felt that my fingers were going tobreak or be crushed against the rocks on the bottom. Don Juan and I both lostour balance at one point and had to step down from the flat rocks into thestream. The water was quite shallow, but the thrashing of the ally's forcearound the frame of the mirror was as frightening as if we had been in a largeriver. The water around our feet was being swirled around madly, but the imagesin the mirror were undisturbed.\"Watch out!\" don Juan yelled. \"Here it comes!\"The tugging changed into a thrust from underneath. Something was grabbing theedge of the mirror; not the outer edge of the frame where we were holding it,but from the inside of the glass. It was as if the glass surface were indeed anopen window and something or somebody were just climbing through it.Don Juan and I fought desperately either to push the mirror down when it wasbeing thrust up or pull it up when it was being tugged downward. In astooped-over position we slowly moved downstream from the original spot. Thewater was deeper and the bottom was covered with slippery rocks.\"Let's lift the mirror out of the water and shake him loose,\" don Juan said in aharsh voice.The loud thrashing continued unremittingly. It was as if we had caught anenormous fish with our bare hands and it was swimming around wildly.It occurred to me that the mirror was in essence a hatch. A strange shape wasactually trying to climb up through it. It was leaning on the edge of the hatchwith a mighty weight and was big enough to displace the reflection of don Juan'sface and mine. I could not see us anymore. I could only distinguish a masstrying to push itself up.The mirror was not resting on the bottom anymore. My fingers were not compressedagainst the rocks. The mirror was in mid-depth, held by the opposing forces ofthe ally's tugs and ours. Don Juan said he was going to extend his handsunderneath the mirror and that I should very quickly grab them in order to havea better leverage to lift the mirror with our forearms. When he let go it tilledto his side. I quickly reached for his hands but there was nothing underneath. Ivacillated a second too long and the mirror flew out of my hands.\"Grab it! Grab it!\" don Juan yelled.I caught the mirror just as it was going to land on the rocks. I lifted it outof the water, but not quickly enough. The water seemed to be like glue. As Ipulled the mirror out, I also pulled a portion of a heavy rubbery substance thatsimply pulled the mirror out of my hands and back into the water.Don Juan, displaying extraordinary nimbleness, caught the mirror and lifted itup edgewise without any difficulty. Never in my life had I had such an attack of melancholy. It was a sadness thathad no precise foundation. I associated it with the memory of the depths I hadseen in the mirror. It was a mixture of pure longing for those depths, plus anabsolute fear of their chilling solitude.Don Juan remarked that in the life of warriors it was extremely natural to besad for no overt reason. Seers say that the luminous egg, as a field of energy,senses its final destination whenever the boundaries of the known are broken. Amere glimpse of the eternity outside the cocoon is enough to disrupt thecoziness of our inventory. The resulting melancholy is sometimes so intense thatit can bring about death.He said that the best way to get rid of melancholy is to make fun of it. Hecommented in a mocking tone that my first attention was doing everything torestore the order that had been disrupted by my contact with the ally. Sincethere was no way of restoring it by rational means, my first attention was doingit by focusing all its power on sadness.I told him that the fact remained the melancholy was real. Indulging in it,moping around, and being gloomy were not part of the feeling of aloneness that Ihad felt upon remembering those depths.\"Something is finally getting through to you,\" he said. \"You're right. There isnothing more lonely than eternity. And nothing is more cozy for us than to be ahuman being. This indeed is another contradiction: How can man keep the bonds ofhis humanness and still venture gladly and purposefully into the absoluteloneliness of eternity? Whenever you resolve this riddle, you'll be ready forthe definitive journey.\"I knew then with total certainty the reason for my sadness. It was a recurrentfeeling with me, one that I would always forget until I again realized the samething: the puniness of humanity against the immensity of that thing-in-itselfwhich I had seen reflected in the mirror.\"Human beings are truly nothing, don Juan,\" I said.\"I know exactly what you're thinking,\" he said. \"Sure, we're nothing, but that'sexactly what makes it the ultimate challenge; that we nothings could actuallyface the loneliness of eternity.\"He abruptly changed the subject, leaving me with my mouth open, my next questionunsaid. He began to discuss our bout with the ally. He said that first of all,the struggle with the ally had been no joke. It had not really been a matter oflife or death, but it had not been a picnic either.\"I chose that technique,\" he went on, \"because my benefactor showed it to me.When I asked him to give me an example of the old seers' techniques, he nearlysplit a gut laughing. My request reminded him so much of his own experience. Hisbenefactor, the nagual Elias, had also given him a harsh demonstration of thesame technique.\"Don Juan said that as he had made the frame for his mirror out of wood, heshould have asked me to do the same, but he wanted to know what would happen ifthe frame was sturdier than his or his benefactor's. Both of their frames broke,and both times the ally came out.He explained that during his own bout the ally ripped the frame apart. He andhis benefactor were left holding two pieces of wood while the mirror sank andthe ally climbed out of it.His benefactor knew what kind of trouble to expect. In the reflection ofmirrors, allies are not really frightening because one sees only a shape, a massof sorts. But when they are out, besides being truly fearsome-looking things,they are a pain in the neck. He remarked that once the allies get out of theirlevel, it is very difficult for them to go back. The same prevails for man. Ifseers venture into a level of those creatures, chances are they are never heardof again.\"My mirror was shattered with the ally's force,\" he said. \"There was no morewindow and the ally couldn't go back, so it came after me. It actually ran afterme, rolling on itself. I scrambled on all fours at top speed, screaming withterror. I went up and down hills like a possessed man. The ally was inches awayfrom me the whole time.\"Don Juan said that his benefactor ran after him, but he was too old and couldnot move fast enough. His benefactor he had the good sense, however, to tell donJuan to back-track, and in that way was able to take measures to get rid of theally. He shouted that he was going to build a fire and that don Juan should runin circles until everything was ready. He went ahead to gather dry brancheswhile don Juan ran around a hill, driven mad with fear.Don Juan confessed that the thought had occurred to him, as he ran around incircles, that his benefactor was actually enjoying the whole thing. He knew thathis benefactor was a warrior capable of finding delight in any conceivablesituation. Why not also in this one?For a moment he got so angry at his benefactor that the ally stopped chasinghim, and don Juan, in no uncertain terms, accused his benefactor of malice. Hisbenefactor didn't answer, but made a gesture of genuine horror as he looked pastdon Juan at the ally, which was looming over the two of them. Don Juan forgothis anger and began running around in circles again.\"My benefactor was indeed a devilish old man,\" don Juan said, laughing. \"He hadlearned to laugh internally. It wouldn't show on his face, so he could pretendto be weeping or raging when he was really laughing. That day, as the allychased me in circles, my benefactor stood there and defended himself from myaccusations.\"I only heard bits of his long speech every time I ran by him. When he wasthrough with that, I heard bits of another long explanation: that he had togather a great deal of wood, that the ally was big, that the fire had to be asbig as the ally itself, that the maneuver might not work.\"Only my maddening fear kept me going. Finally he must have realized that I wasabout to drop dead from exhaustion; he built the fire and with the flames heshielded me from the ally.\"Don Juan said that they stayed by the fire for the entire night. The worst timefor him was when his benefactor had to go away to look for more dry branches andleft him alone. He was so afraid that he promised to God that he was going toleave the path of knowledge and become a farmer.\"In the morning, after I had exhausted all my energy, the ally managed to shoveme into the fire, and I was badly burned,\" don Juan added.\"What happened to the ally?\" I asked.\"My benefactor never told me what happened to it,\" he replied. \"But I have thefeeling that it is still running around aimlessly, trying to find its way back.\"\"And what happened to your promise to God?\"\"My benefactor said not to worry, that it had been a good promise, but that Ididn't know yet that there is no one to hear such promises, because there is noGod. All there is is the Eagle's emanations, and there is no way to makepromises to them.\"\"What would have happened if the ally had caught you?\" I asked.\"I might have died of fright,\" he said. \"If I had known what was entailed inbeing caught I would've let it catch me. At that time I was a reckless man. Oncean ally catches you, you either have a heart attack and die, or you wrestle withit. Then after a moment of thrashing around in sham ferocity, the ally's energywanes. There is nothing that an ally can do to us, or vice versa. We areseparated by an abyss.\"The ancient seers believed that at the moment the ally's energy dwindles theally surrenders its power to man. Power, my eye! The old seers had allies comingout of their ears and their allies' power didn't mean a thing.\"Don Juan explained that once again it had been up to the new seers to straightenout this confusion. They had found that the only thing that counts isimpeccability, that is, freed energy. There were indeed some among the ancientseers who were saved by their allies, but that had had nothing to do with theallies' power to fend off anything. Rather, it was the men's impeccability thathad permitted them to use the energy of those other forms of life.The new seers also found out the most important thing yet about the allies: whatmakes them useless or usable to man. Useless allies, of which there arestaggering numbers, are those that have emanations inside them for which we haveno match inside ourselves. They are so different from us as to be thoroughlyunusable. Other allies, which are remarkably few in number, are akin to us,meaning that they possess occasional emanations that match ours.\"How is that kind utilized by man?\" I asked.\"We should use another word instead of 'utilize',\" he replied. \"I'd say thatwhat takes place between seers and allies of this kind is a fair exchange ofenergy.\"\"How does the exchange take place?\" I asked.\"Through their matching emanations. Those emanations are, naturally, on theleft-side awareness of man; the side that the average man never uses. For thisreason, allies are totally barred from the world of the right-side awareness, orthe side of rationality.\"He said that the matching emanations give both a common ground. Then, withfamiliarity, a deeper link is established which allows both forms of life toprofit. Seers seek the allies' ethereal quality. They make fabulous scouts andguardians. Allies seek the greater energy field of man, and with it they caneven materialize themselves.He assured me that experienced seers play those shared emanations until theybring them into total focus. The exchange takes place at that time. The ancientseers did not understand this process, and they developed complex techniques ofgazing in order to descend into the depths that I had seen in the mirror.\"The old seers had a very elaborate tool to help them in their descent,\" he wenton. \"It was a rope of special twine that they tied around their waist. It had asoft butt soaked in resin which fitted into the navel itself, like a plug. Theseers had an assistant or a number of them who held them by the rope while theywere lost in their gazing. Naturally, to gaze directly into the reflection of adeep, clear pond or lake is infinitely more overwhelming and dangerous than whatwe did with the mirror.\"\"But did they actually descend bodily?\" I asked.\"You'd be surprised what men are capable of, especially if they controlawareness,\" he replied. \"The old seers were aberrant. In their excursions to thedepths they found marvels. It was routine for them to encounter allies.\"Of course, by now you realize that to say the depths is a figure of speech.There are no depths, there is only the handling of awareness. Yet the old seersnever made that realization.\"I told don Juan that from what he had said about his experience with the ally,plus my own subjective impression on feeling the ally's thrashing force in thewater, I had concluded that allies are very aggressive.\"Not really,\" he said. \"It is not that they don't have enough energy to beaggressive, but rather that they have a different kind of energy. They are morelike an electric current. Organic beings are more like heat waves.\"\"But why did it chase you for such a long time?\" I asked.\"That's no mystery,\" he said. \"They are attracted to emotions. Animal fear iswhat attracts them the most; it releases the kind of energy that suits them. Theemanations inside them are rallied by animal fear. Since my fear was relentlessthe ally went after it, or rather, my fear hooked the ally and didn't let itgo.\"He said that it was the old seers who found out that allies enjoy animal fearmore than anything else. They even went to the extreme of purposely feeding itto their allies by actually scaring people to death. The old seers wereconvinced that the allies had human feelings, but the new seers saw itdifferently. They saw that allies are attracted to the energy released byemotions. Love is equally effective, as well as hatred, or sadness.Don Juan added that if he had felt love for that ally, the ally would have comeafter him anyway, although the chase would have had a different mood.I asked him whether the ally would have stopped going after him if he hadcontrolled his fear. He answered that controlling fear was a trick of the oldseers. They learned to control it to the point of being able to parcel it out.They hooked their allies with their own fear, and by gradually doling it outlike food they actually held the allies in bondage.\"Those old seers were terrifying men,\" don Juan continued. \"I shouldn't use thepast tense- they are terrifying even today. Their bid is to dominate; to mastereverybody and everything.\"\"Even today, don Juan?\" I asked, trying to get him to explain further.He changed the subject by commenting that I had missed the opportunity of beingreally scared beyond measure. He said that doubtless the way I had sealed theframe of the mirror with tar had prevented the water from seeping behind theglass. He counted that as the deciding factor that had kept the ally fromsmashing the mirror.\"Too bad,\" he said. \"You might even have liked that ally. By the way, it was notthe same one that came the day before. The second one was perfectly akin toyou.\"\"Don't you have some allies yourself, don Juan?\" I asked.\"As you know, I have my benefactor's allies,\" he said. \"I can't say that I havethe same feeling for them that my benefactor did. He was a serene, butthoroughly passionate man who lavishly gave away everything he possessed,including his energy. He loved his allies. To him it was no sweat to allow theallies to use his energy and materialize themselves. There was one in particularthat could even take a grotesque human form.\"Don Juan went on to say that since he was not partial to allies, he had nevergiven me a real taste of them as his benefactor had done to him while he wasstill recovering from the wound in his chest.It all began with the thought that his benefactor was a strange man. Havingbarely escaped from the clutches of the petty tyrant, don Juan suspected that hehad fallen into another trap. His intention was to wait a few days to get hisstrength back and then run away when the old man was not home.But the old man must have read his thoughts, because one day, in a confidentialtone, he whispered to don Juan that he ought to get well as quickly as possibleso that the two of them could escape from his captor and tormentor. Then,shaking with fear and impotence, the old man flung the door open and a monstrousfish-faced man came into the room, as if he had been listening behind the door.He was a grayish-green, had only one huge unblinking eye, and was as big as adoor.Don Juan said that he was so surprised and terrified that he passed out, and ittook him years to get out from under the spell of that fright.\"Are your allies useful to you, don Juan?\" I asked.\"That's a very difficult thing to decide,\" he said.\"In some way, I love the allies my benefactor gave me. They are capable ofgiving back inconceivable affection. But they are incomprehensible to me. Theywere given to me for companionship in case I am ever stranded alone in thatimmensity that is the Eagle's emanations.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"7. The Assemblage PointDon Juan discontinued his explanation of the mastery of awareness for severalmonths after my bout with the allies. One day he started it again. A strangeevent triggered it.Don Juan was in northern Mexico. It was late afternoon. I had just arrived atthe house he kept there, and he immediately had me shift into heightenedawareness. And I had instantly remembered that don Juan always came back toSonora as means of renewal. He had explained that a nagual, being a leader whohas tremendous responsibilities, has to have a physical point of reference, aplace where an amenable confluence of energies occurs. The Sonoran desert wassuch a place for him.On entering into heightened awareness, I had noticed that there was anotherperson hiding in the semidarkness inside the house. I asked don Juan if Genarowas with him. He replied that he was alone, that what I had noticed was one ofhis allies, the one that guarded the house.Don Juan then made a strange gesture. He contorted his face as if he weresurprised or terrified. And instantly the frightening shape of a strange manappeared at the door of the room where we were.The presence of the strange man scared me so much that I actually felt dizzy.And before I could recuperate from my fright, the man lurched at me with achilling ferocity. As he grabbed my forearms, I felt ajolt of something quitelike a discharge of an electric current.I was speechless, caught in a terror I could not dispel. Don Juan was smiling atme. I mumbled and groaned, trying to voice a plea for help, while I felt an evengreater jolt.The man tightened his grip and tried to throw me backward on the ground. DonJuan, with no hurry in his voice, urged me to pull myself together and not fightmy fear, but roll with it.\"Be afraid without being terrified,\" he said. Don Juan came to my side and,without intervening in my struggle, whispered in my ear that I should put all myconcentration on the midpoint of my body.Over the years, he had insisted that I measure my body to the hundredth of aninch and establish its exact midpoint, lengthwise as well as in width. He hadalways said that such a point is a true center of energy in all of us.As soon as I had focused my attention on that midpoint, the man let go of me. Atthat instant I became aware that what I had thought was a human being wassomething that only looked like one. The moment it lost its human shape to me,the ally became an amorphous blob of opaque light. It moved away. I went afterit, moved by a great force that made me follow that opaque light.Don Juan stopped me. He gently walked me to the porch of his house and made mesit down on a sturdy crate he used as a bench.I was terribly disturbed by the experience, but even more disturbed by the factthat my paralyzing fear had disappeared so fast and so completely.I commented on my abrupt change of mood. Don Juan said that there was nothingstrange about my volatile change, and that fear did not exist as soon as theglow of awareness moved beyond a certain threshold inside man's cocoon.He then began his explanation. He briefly outlined the truths about awareness hehad discussed:...that there is no objective world, but only a universe of energy fields whichseers call the Eagle's emanations;...that human beings are made of the Eagle's emanations and are in essencebubbles of luminescent energy- each of us wrapped in a cocoon that encloses asmall portion of these emanations;...that awareness is achieved by the constant pressure that the emanationsoutside our cocoons, which are called emanations at large, exert on those insideour cocoons;....and that that awareness gives rise to perception which happens when theemanations inside our cocoons align themselves with the corresponding emanationsat large. \"The next truth,\" he went on, \"is that perception takes place because there isin each of us an agent called the assemblage point that selects internal andexternal emanations for alignment. The particular alignment that we perceive asthe world is the product of the specific spot where our assemblage point islocated on our cocoon.\"He repeated this several times, allowing me time to grasp it. Then he said thatin order to corroborate the truths about awareness, I needed energy.\"I've mentioned to you,\" he continued, \"that dealing with petty tyrants helpsseers accomplish a sophisticated maneuver: that maneuver is to move theirassemblage points.\"He said that for me to have perceived an ally meant that I had moved myassemblage point away from its customary position. In other words, my glow ofawareness had moved beyond a certain threshold, also erasing my fear. And allthis had happened because I had enough surplus energy. Later that night, after we had returned from a trip into the surroundingmountains which had been part of his teachings for the right side, don Juan hadme shift again into heightened awareness and then continued his explanation. Hetold me that in order to discuss the nature of the assemblage point, he had tostart with a discussion of the first attention.He said that the new seers looked into the unnoticed ways in which the firstattention functions. Then, as they tried to explain them to others, they devisedan order for the truths about awareness.He assured me that not every seer is given to explaining. For instance, hisbenefactor, the nagual Julian, could not have cared less about explanations. Butthe nagual Julian's benefactor, the nagual Elias, whom don Juan was fortunateenough to meet, did care. Between the nagual Elias's detailed, lengthyexplanations, the nagual Julian's scanty ones, and his own personal seeing, donJuan came to understand and to corroborate those truths.Don Juan explained that in order for our first attention to bring into focus theworld that we normally perceive, it has to emphasize certain emanations selectedfrom the narrow band of emanations where mankind-in-general's awareness islocated.The discarded emanations are still within our reach, but remain dormant; andtypically unknown to us for the duration of our lives.The new seers call the emphasized emanations: the right side, normal awareness,the tonal, this world, the known, the first attention. The average man calls it:reality, rationality, common sense.The emphasized emanations compose a large portion of man's band of awareness,but a very small piece of the total spectrum of emanations present inside thecocoon of man.The disregarded emanations within man's band are thought of as a sort ofpreamble to the unknown; with the unknown proper consisting of the bulk of ouremanations which are not part of the human band and which are never emphasizedby the average person. Seers call them the left-side awareness, the nagual, theother world, the unknown, the second attention.\"This process of emphasizing certain emanations,\" don Juan went on, \"wasdiscovered and practiced by the old seers. They realized that a nagual man or anagual woman, by the fact that they have extra strength, can push the emphasisaway from the usual emanations and make it shift to neighboring ones. That pushis known as the nagual's blow.\"Don Juan said that the shift was utilized by the old seers in practical ways tokeep their apprentices in bondage. With that blow they made their apprenticesenter into a state of the keenest, most impressionable heightened awareness.Then while they were helplessly pliable, the old seers taught them aberranttechniques that made the apprentices into sinister men, just like theirteachers.The new seers employ the same technique of a shift in emanation emphasis, butinstead of using it for sordid purposes, they use it to guide their apprenticesto learn about man's possibilities.Don Juan explained that the nagual's blow has to be delivered on a precise spoton the assemblage point which varies minutely from person to person. Also, theblow has to be delivered by a nagual who sees.He assured me that it is equally useless to have the strength of a nagual andnot see, as it is to see and not have the strength of a nagual. In either case,the results are just blows. A seer could strike on the precise spot over andover without the strength to move awareness; and a non-seeing nagual would notbe able to strike the precise spot.He also said that the old seers discovered that the assemblage point is not inthe physical body, but in the luminous shell; in the cocoon itself. The nagualidentifies that spot by its intense luminosity and pushes it, rather thanstriking it. The force of the push creates a dent in the cocoon and it is feltlike a blow to the right shoulder blade, a blow that knocks all the air out ofthe lungs.\"Are there different types of dents?\" I asked.\"There are only two types,\" he responded. \"One is a concavity and the other is acrevice; each has a distinct effect. The concavity is a temporary feature andproduces a temporary shift- but the crevice is a profound and permanent featureof the cocoon and produces a permanent shift.\"He explained that usually a luminous cocoon hardened by self-reflection is notaffected at all by the nagual's blow. Sometimes, however, the cocoon of man isvery pliable and the smallest force creates a bowl-like dent ranging in sizefrom a small depression to one that is a third the size of the total cocoon; orit creates a crevice that may run across the width of the egglike shell, oralong its length, making the cocoon look as if it has curled in on itself.Some luminous shells, after being dented, go back to their original shapeinstantly. Others remain dented for hours or even days at a time, but theyrevert back by themselves. Still others get a firm, impervious dent thatrequires another blow from the nagual on a bordering area to restore theoriginal shape of the luminous cocoon. And a few never lose their indentationonce they get it. No matter how many blows they get from a nagual they neverrevert back to their egglike shapes.Don Juan further said that the dent acts on the first attention by displacingthe glow of awareness. The dent presses the emanations inside the luminousshell, and the seers witness how the first attention shifts its emphasis underthe force of that pressure. The dent, by displacing the Eagle's emanationsinside the cocoon, makes the glow of awareness fall on other emanations fromareas that are ordinarily inaccessible to the first attention.I asked him if the glow of awareness is seen only on the surface of the luminouscocoon. He did not answer me right away. He seemed to immerse himself inthought. After perhaps ten minutes he answered my question.He said that normally the glow of awareness is seen on the surface of the cocoonof all sentient beings. After man develops attention, however, the glow ofawareness acquires depth. In other words, it is transmitted from the surface ofthe cocoon to quite a number of emanations inside the cocoon.\"The old seers knew what they were doing when they handled awareness,\" he wenton. \"They realized that by creating a dent in the cocoon of man, they couldforce the glow of awareness, since it is already glowing on the emanationsinside the cocoon, to spread to other neighboring ones.\"\"You make it all sound as if it's a physical affair,\" I said. \"How can dents bemade in something that is just a glow?\"\"In some inexplicable way, it is a matter of a glow that creates a dent inanother glow,\" he replied. \"Your flaw is to remain glued to the inventory ofreason. Reason doesn't deal with man as energy. Reason deals with instrumentsthat create energy, but it has never seriously occurred to reason that we arebetter than instruments.\"We are organisms that create energy. We are a bubble of energy. It isn'tfarfetched, then, that a bubble of energy would make a dent in another bubble ofenergy.\"He said that the glow of awareness created by the dent should rightfully becalled temporary heightened attention, because it emphasizes emanations that areso proximal to the habitual ones that the change is minimal, yet the shiftproduces a greater capacity to understand and to concentrate and, above all, agreater capacity to forget.Seers knew exactly how to use this upshift in the scale of quality. They sawthat only the emanations surrounding those we use daily suddenly become brightafter the nagual's blow. The more distant ones remain unmoved, which meant tothem that while being in a state of heightened attention, human beings couldwork as if they were in the world of everyday life. The need of a nagual man anda nagual woman became paramount to them, because that state lasts only for aslong as the depression remains, after which the experiences are immediatelyforgotten.\"Why does one have to forget?\" I asked.\"Because the emanations that account for greater clarity cease to be emphasizedonce warriors are out of heightened awareness,\" he replied. \"Without thatemphasis whatever they experience or witness vanishes.\"Don Juan said that one of the tasks the new seers had devised for their studentswas to force them to remember, that is, to re-emphasize by themselves at a latertime those emanations used during states of heightened awareness.He reminded me that Genaro was always recommending to me that I learn to writewith the tip of my finger instead of a pencil so as not to accumulate notes. DonJuan said that what Genaro had actually meant was that while I was in states ofheightened awareness I should utilize some unused emanations for storage ofdialogue and experience, and someday recall it all by reemphasizing theemanations that were used.He went on to explain that a state of heightened awareness is seen not only as aglow that goes deeper inside the egglike shape of human beings, but also as amore intense glow on the surface of the cocoon.Yet it is nothing in comparison to the glow produced by a state of totalawareness which is seen as a burst of incandescence in the entire luminous egg.It is an explosion of light of such a magnitude that the boundaries of the shellare diffused and the inside emanations extend themselves beyond anythingimaginable.\"Are those special cases, don Juan?\"\"Certainly. They happen only to seers. No other men or any other livingcreatures brighten up like that. Seers who deliberately attain total awarenessare a sight to behold. That is the moment when they burn from within. The firefrom within consumes them, and in full awareness they fuse themselves to theemanations at large, and glide into eternity.\" After a few days in Sonora, I drove don Juan back to the town in the southernpart of Mexico where he and his party of warriors lived.The next day was hot and hazy. I felt lazy and somehow annoyed. In midafternoon,there was a most unpleasant quietude in that town. Don Juan and I were sittingon the comfortable chairs in the big room.I told him that life in rural Mexico was not my cup of tea. I disliked thefeeling I had that the silence of that town was forced. The only noise I everheard was the sound of children's voices yelling in the distance. I was neverable to find out whether they were playing or yelling in pain.\"When you're here, you're always in a state of heightened awareness,\" don Juansaid. \"That makes a great difference. But no matter what, you should be gettingused to living in a town like this. Someday you will live in one.\"\"Why should I have to live in a town like this, don Juan?\"\"I've explained to you that the new seers aim to be free. And freedom has themost devastating implications. Among them is the implication that warriors mustpurposely seek change.\"Your predilection is to live the way you do. You stimulate your reason byrunning through your inventory and pitting it against your friends' inventories.Those maneuvers leave you very little time to examine yourself and your fate.\"You will have to give up all that. Likewise, if all you knew were the dead calmof this town, you'd have to seek, sooner or later, the other side of the coin.\"\"Is that what you're doing here, don Juan?\"\"Our case is a little bit different, because we are at the end of our trail. Weare not seeking anything. What all of us do here is something comprehensibleonly to a warrior. We go from day to day doing nothing. We are waiting. I willnot tire of repeating this: we know that we are waiting and we know what we arewaiting for. We are waiting for freedom!\"And now that you know that,\" he added with a grin, \"let's get back to ourdiscussion of awareness.\"Usually, when we were in that room we were never interrupted by anyone and donJuan would always decide on the length of our discussions. But this time therewas a polite knock on the door and Genaro walked in and sat down. I had not seenGenaro since the day after we had run out of his house in a great hurry. Iembraced him.\"Genaro has something to tell you,\" don Juan said. \"I've told you that he is themaster of awareness. Now I can tell you what all that means. He can make theassemblage point move deeper into the luminous egg after that point has beenjolted out of its position by the nagual's blow.\"He explained that Genaro had pushed my assemblage point countless times after Ihad attained heightened awareness. The day we had gone to the gigantic flat rockto talk, Genaro had made my assemblage point move dramatically into the leftside- so dramatically, in fact, that it had been a bit dangerous.Don Juan stopped talking and seemed to be ready to give Genaro the spotlight. Henodded as if to signal Genaro to say something. Genaro stood up and came to myside.\"Flame is very important,\" he said softly. \"Do you remember that day when I madeyou look at the reflection of the sunlight on a piece of quartz when we weresitting on that big flat rock?\"When Genaro mentioned it I remembered. On that day just after don Juan hadstopped talking, Genaro had pointed to the refraction of light as it wentthrough a piece of polished quartz that he had taken out of his pocket andplaced on the flat rock. The shine of the quartz had immediately caught myattention. The next thing I knew, I was crouching on the flat rock as don Juanstood by with a worried look on his face.I was about to tell Genaro what I had remembered when he began to talk. He puthis mouth to my ear and pointed to one of the two gasoline lamps in the room.\"Look at the flame,\" he said. \"There is no heat in it. It's pure flame. Pureflame can take you to the depths of the unknown.\"As he talked, I began to feel a strange pressure. It was a physical heaviness.My ears were buzzing. My eyes teared to the point that I could hardly make outthe shape of the furniture. My vision seemed to be totally out of focus.Although my eyes were open, I could not see the intense light of the gasolinelamps. Everything around me was dark. There were streaks of chartreusephosphorescence that illuminated dark, moving clouds. Then, as abruptly as ithad faded away, my eyesight returned.I could not make out where I was. I seemed to be floating like a balloon. I wasalone. I had a pang of terror, and my reason rushed in to construct anexplanation that made sense to me at that moment: Genaro had hypnotized me,using the flame of the gasoline lamp. I felt almost satisfied.I quietly floated, trying not to worry. I thought that a way to avoid worryingwas to concentrate on the stages that I would have to go through to wake up.The first thing I noticed was that I was not myself. I could not really look atanything because I had nothing to look with. When I tried to examine my body Irealized that I could only be aware and yet it was as if I were looking downinto infinite space.There were portentous clouds of brilliant light and masses of blackness. Bothwere in motion. I clearly saw a ripple of amber glow that was coming at me, likean enormous, slow ocean wave. I knew then that I was like a buoy floating inspace, and that the wave was going to overtake me and carry me. I accepted it asunavoidable.But just before it hit me something thoroughly unexpected happened. A wind blewme out of the wave's path.The force of that wind carried me with tremendous speed. I went through animmense tunnel of intense colored lights. My vision blurred completely and thenI felt that I was waking up, that I had been having a dream, a hypnotic dreambrought about by Genaro, in the next instant I was back in the room with donJuan and Genaro.I slept most of the following day. In the late afternoon, don Juan and I againsat down to talk. Genaro had been with me earlier, but had refused to comment onmy experience.\"Genaro again pushed your assemblage point last night,\" don Juan said. \"Butperhaps the shove was too forceful.\"I eagerly told don Juan the content of my vision. He smiled, obviously bored.\"Your assemblage point moved away from its normal position,\" he said. \"And thatmade you perceive emanations that are not ordinarily perceived. Sounds likenothing, doesn't it? And yet it is a supreme accomplishment that the new seersstrive to elucidate.\"He explained that human beings repeatedly choose the same emanations forperceiving because of two reasons. First, and most important, because we havebeen taught that those emanations are perceivable; and second because ourassemblage points select and prepare those emanations for being used.\"Every living being,\" he went on, \"has an assemblage point which selectsemanations for emphasis. Seers can see whether sentient beings share the sameview of the world by seeing if the emanations their assemblage points haveselected are the same.\"He affirmed that one of the most important breakthroughs for the new seers wasto find that the spot where that point is located on the cocoon of all livingcreatures is not a permanent feature. It is established on that specific spot byhabit. Hence the tremendous stress the new seers put on new actions, on newpracticalities. They want desperately to arrive at new usages, new habits.\"The nagual's blow is of great importance,\" he went on, \"because it makes thatpoint move. It alters its location. Sometimes it even creates a permanentcrevice there and the assemblage point is totally dislodged; and awarenesschanges dramatically.\"However, a matter of even greater importance is to properly understand thetruths about awareness in order to realize that the assemblage point can bemoved from within.\"The unfortunate truth is that human beings always lose by default. They simplydon't know about their possibilities.\"\"How can one accomplish that change from within?\" I asked.\"The new seers say that realization is the technique,\" he said. \"They say that,first of all, one must become aware that the world we perceive is the result ofour assemblage points' being located on a specific spot on the cocoon. Once thatis understood, the assemblage point can move almost at will as a consequence ofnew habits.\"I did not quite understand what he meant by habits. I asked him to clarify hispoint.\"The assemblage point of man,\" he said, \"appears around a definite area of thecocoon because the Eagle commands it. But the precise spot is determined byhabit; by repetitious acts.\"First we learn that it can be placed there and then we ourselves command it tobe there. Our command becomes the Eagle's command and the assemblage pointbecomes fixated at that spot.\"Consider this very carefully; our command becomes the Eagle's command. The oldseers paid dearly for that finding. We'll come back to that later on.\"He stated once again that the old seers had concentrated exclusively ondeveloping thousands of the most complex techniques of sorcery. He added thatwhat they never realized was that their intricate devices, as bizarre as theywere, had no other value than being the means to break the fixation of theirassemblage points and make them move.I asked him to explain what he had said.\"I've mentioned to you that sorcery is something like entering a dead-endstreet,\" he replied. \"What I meant was that sorcery practices have no intrinsicvalue. Their worth is indirect. Their real function is to make the assemblagepoint shift by making the first attention release its control on that point.\"The new seers realized the true role those sorcery practices played, anddecided to go directly into the process of making their assemblage points shift;avoiding all the nonsense of rituals and incantations.\"Yet rituals and incantations are indeed necessary at one time in everywarrior's life. I personally have initiated you in all kinds of sorceryprocedures, but only for purposes of luring your first attention away from thepower of self-absorption, which keeps your assemblage point rigidly fixed.\"He added that the obsessive entanglement of the first attention inself-absorption or reason is a powerful binding force. Ritual behavior, becauseit is repetitive, forces the first attention to free some energy from watchingthe inventory, and as a consequence the assemblage point loses its rigidity.\"What happens to the persons whose assemblage points lose rigidity?\" I asked.\"If they're not warriors, they think they're losing their minds,\" he said,smiling. \"Just as you thought you were going crazy at one time. If they'rewarriors, they know they've gone crazy, but they patiently wait. You see, to behealthy and sane means that the assemblage point is immovable. When it shifts,it literally means that one is deranged.\"He said that two options are opened to warriors whose assemblage points haveshifted....One is to acknowledge being ill and to behave in deranged ways; reactingemotionally to the strange worlds that their shifts force them to witness....The other is to remain impassive, untouched, knowing that the assemblagepoint always returns to its original position.\"What if the assemblage point doesn't return to its original position?\" I asked.\"Then those people are lost,\" he said. \"They are either incurably crazy, becausetheir assemblage points could never assemble the world as we know it, or theyare peerless seers who have begun their movement toward the unknown.\"\"What determines whether it is one or the other?\"\"Energy! Impeccability! Impeccable warriors don't lose their marbles. Theyremain untouched. I've said to you many times that impeccable warriors may seehorrifying worlds, and yet the next moment they are telling a joke, laughingwith their friends or with strangers.\"I said to him then what I had told him many times before: What made me think Iwas ill was a series of disruptive sensorial experiences that I had had asaftereffects of ingesting hallucinogenic plants. I went through states of totalspace and time discordance; very annoying lapses of mental concentration; actualvisions or hallucinations of places and people I would be staring at as if theyreally existed. I could not help thinking that I was losing my mind.\"By all ordinary measures, you were indeed losing your mind,\" he said, \"but inthe seers' view, if you had lost it, you wouldn't have lost much. The mind, fora seer, is nothing but the self-reflection of the inventory of man. If you losethat self-reflection but don't lose your underpinnings, you actually live aninfinitely stronger life than if you had kept it.\"He remarked that my flaw was my emotional reaction, which prevented me fromrealizing that the oddity of my sensorial experiences was determined by thedepth to which my assemblage point had moved into man's band of emanations.I told him that I couldn't understand what he was explaining because theconfiguration that he had called man's band of emanations was somethingincomprehensible to me. I had pictured it to be like a ribbon placed on thesurface of a ball.He said that calling it a band was misleading, and that he was going to use ananalogy to illustrate what he meant. He explained that the luminous shape of manis like a ball of jack cheese with a thick disk of darker cheese injected intoit. He looked at me and chuckled. He knew that I did not like cheese.He made a diagram on a small blackboard. He drew an egglike shape and divided itin four longitudinal sections, saying that he would immediately erase thedivision lines because he had drawn them only to give me an idea where the bandwas located in the cocoon of man. He then drew a thick band at the line betweenthe first and second sections and erased the division lines. He explained thatthe band was like a disk of cheddar cheese that had been inserted into the ballof jack cheese.\"Now if that ball of jack cheese were transparent,\" he went on, \"you would havethe perfect replica of man's cocoon. The cheddar cheese goes all the way insidethe ball of jack cheese. It's a disk that goes from the surface on one side tothe surface on the other side.\"The assemblage point of man is located high up, three-fourths of the way towardthe top of the egg on the surface of the cocoon. When a nagual presses on thatpoint of intense luminosity, the point moves into the disk of the cheddarcheese. Heightened awareness comes about when the intense glow of the assemblagepoint lights up dormant emanations way inside the disk of cheddar cheese. To seethe glow of the assemblage point moving inside that disk gives the feeling thatit is shifting toward the left on the surface of the cocoon.\"He repeated his analogy three or four times, but I did not understand it and hehad to explain it further. He said that the transparency of the luminous eggcreates the impression of a movement toward the left, when in fact everymovement of the assemblage point is in depth, into the center of the luminousegg along the thickness of man's band.I remarked that what he was saying made it sound as if seers would be usingtheir eyes when they see the assemblage point move.\"Man is not the unknowable,\" he said. \"Man's luminosity can be seen almost as ifone were using the eyes alone.\"He further explained that the old seers had seen the movement of the assemblagepoint, but it never occurred to them that it was a movement in depth; insteadthey followed their seeing and coined the phrase \"shift to the left,\" which thenew seers retained although they knew that it was erroneous to call it a shiftto the left.He also said that in the course of my activity with him he had made myassemblage point move countless times, as was the case at that very moment.Since the shift of the assemblage point was always in depth, I had never lost mysense of identity in spite of the fact that I was always using emanations I hadnever used before.\"When the nagual pushes that point,\" he went on, \"the point ends up any whichway along man's band. But it absolutely doesn't matter where, because whereverit ends up is always virgin ground.\"The grand test that the new seers developed for their 'warrior apprentices' isto retrace the journey that their assemblage points took under the influence ofthe nagual. This retracing, when it is completed, is called regaining thetotality of oneself.\"He went on to say that the contention [* contention- a point asserted as part ofan argument] of the new seers is that in the course of our growth, once the glowof awareness focuses on man's band of emanations and selects some of them foremphasis, it enters into a vicious circle.The more it emphasizes certain emanations, the more stable the assemblage pointgets to be. This is equivalent to saying that our command becomes the Eagle'scommand. It goes without saying that when our awareness develops into firstattention the command is so strong that to break that circle and make theassemblage point shift is a genuine triumph.Don Juan said that the assemblage point is also responsible for making the firstattention perceive in terms of clusters. An example of a cluster of emanationsthat receive emphasis together is the human body as we perceive it. Another partof our total being, our luminous cocoon, never receives emphasis and isrelegated to oblivion because the effect of the assemblage point is not only tomake us perceive clusters of emanations, but also to make us disregardemanations.When I pressed hard for an explanation of clustering he replied that theassemblage point radiates a glow that groups together bundles of encasedemanations. These bundles then become aligned, as bundles, with the emanationsat large. Clustering is carried out even when seers deal with the emanationsthat are never used. Whenever they are emphasized, we perceive them just as weperceive the clusters of the first attention.\"One of the greatest moments the new seers had,\" he continued, \"was when theyfound out that the unknown is merely the emanations discarded by the firstattention. The unknown is a huge affair, but an affair, mind you, whereclustering can be done. The unknowable, on the other hand, is an eternity whereour assemblage point has no way of clustering anything.\"He explained that the assemblage point is like a luminous magnet that picksemanations and groups them together wherever it moves within the bounds of man'sband of emanations. This discovery was the glory of the new seers, for it putthe unknown in a new light. The new seers noticed that some of the obsessivevisions of seers- the ones that were almost impossible to conceive- coincidedwith a shift of the assemblage point to the region of man's band which isdiametrically opposed to where it is ordinarily located.\"Those were visions of the dark side of man,\" he asserted.\"Why do you call it the dark side of man?\" I asked.\"Because it is somber and foreboding,\" he said. \"It's not only the unknown, butthe 'who cares to know it'.\"\"How about the emanations that are inside the cocoon but out of the bounds ofman's band?\" I asked. \"Can they be perceived?\"\"Yes, but in really indescribable ways,\" he said. \"They're not the humanunknown, as is the case with the unused emanations in the band of man, but thenearly immeasurable unknown where human traits do not figure at all. It isreally an area of such an overpowering vastness that the best of seers would behard put to describe it.\"I insisted once more that it seemed to me that the mystery is obviously withinus.\"The mystery is outside us,\" he said, \"Inside us we have only emanations tryingto break the cocoon. And this fact aberrates us, one way or another, whetherwe're average men or warriors. Only the new seers get around this. They struggleto see. And by means of the shifts of their assemblage points, they get torealize that the mystery is perceiving. Not so much what we perceive, but whatmakes us perceive.\"I've mentioned to you that the new seers believe that our senses are capable ofdetecting anything. They believe this because they see that the position of theassemblage point is what dictates what our senses perceive.\"If the assemblage point aligns emanations inside the cocoon in a positiondifferent from its normal one, the human senses perceive in inconceivable ways.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"8. The Position of the Assemblage PointThe next time don Juan resumed his explanation of the mastery of awareness wewere again in his house in southern Mexico. That house was actually owned by allthe members of the nagual's party, but Silvio Manuel officiated as the owner andeveryone openly referred to it as Silvio Manuel's house, although I, for someinexplicable reason, had gotten used to calling it don Juan's house.Don Juan, Genaro, and I had returned to the house from a trip to the mountains.That day, as we relaxed after the long drive and ate a late lunch, I asked donJuan the reason for the curious deception. He assured me that no deception wasinvolved, and that to call it Silvio Manuel's house was an exercise in the artof stalking to be performed by all the members of the nagual's party under anycircumstances, even in the privacy of their own thoughts. For any of them toinsist on thinking about the house in any other terms was tantamount to denyingtheir links to the nagual's party.I protested that he had never told me that. I did not want to cause anydissension with my habits.\"Don't worry about it,\" he said, smiling at me and patting my back. \"You cancall this house whatever you want. The nagual has authority. The nagual woman,for instance, calls it the house of shadows.\"Our conversation was interrupted, and I did not see him until he sent for me tocome to the back patio a couple of hours later.He and Genaro were strolling around at the far end of the corridor. I could seethem moving their hands in what seemed to be an animated conversation.It was a clear sunny day. The midafternoon sun shone directly on some of theflower pots that hung from the eaves of the roof around the corridor andprojected their shadows on the north and east walls of the patio. Thecombination of intense yellow sunlight, the massive black shadows of the pots,and the lovely, delicate, bare shadows of the frail flowering plants that grewin them was stunning. Someone with a keen eye for balance and order had prunedthose plants to create such an exquisite effect.\"The nagual woman has done that,\" don Juan said as if reading my thoughts. \"Shegazes at these shadows in the afternoons.\"The thought of her gazing at shadows in the afternoons had a swift anddevastating effect on me. The intense yellow light of that hour, the quietnessof that town, and the affection that I felt for the nagual woman conjured up forme in one instant all the solitude of the warriors' endless path.Don Juan had defined the scope of that path when he said to me that the newseers are the warriors of total freedom; that their only search is the ultimateliberation that comes when they attain total awareness.I understood with unimpaired clarity as I looked at those haunting shadows onthe wall what it meant to the nagual woman when she said that to read poems outloud was the only release that her spirit had.I remember that the day before she had read something to me there in the patio,but I had not quite understood her urgency; her longing. It was a poem by JuanRamon Jimenez, \"Hora Inmensa,\" which she told me synthesized for her thesolitude of warriors who live to escape to total freedom. Only a bell and a bird break the stillness...It seems that the two talk with the setting sunGolden colored silence, the afternoon is made of crystalsA roving purity sways the cold treesand beyond all thata transparent river dreams that trampling over pearlsit breaks looseand flows into infinity Don Juan and Genaro came to my side and looked at me with an expression ofsurprise.\"What are we really doing, don Juan?\" I asked. \"Is it possible that warriors areonly preparing themselves for death?\"\"No way,\" he said, gently patting my shoulder. \"Warriors prepare themselves tobe aware, and full awareness comes to them only when there is no moreself-importance left in them. Only when they are nothing do they becomeeverything.\"We were quiet for a moment. Then don Juan asked me if I was in the throes ofself-pity. I did not answer because I was not sure.\"You're not sorry that you're here, are you?\" don Juan asked with a faint smile.\"He's certainly not,\" Genaro assured him. Then he seemed to have a moment ofdoubt. He scratched his head, then looked at me and arched his brows. \"Maybe youare,\" he said. \"Are you?\"\"He's certainly not,\" don Juan assured Genaro this time. He went through thesame gestures of scratching his head and arching his brows. \"Maybe you are,\" hesaid. \"Are you?\"\"He's certainly not!\" Genaro boomed, and both of them exploded into uncontrolledlaughter.When they had calmed down, don Juan said that self-importance is the motivatingforce for every attack of melancholy. He added that warriors are entitled tohave profound states of sadness, but that sadness is there only to make themlaugh.\"Genaro has something to show you which is more exciting than all the self-pityyou can muster up,\" don Juan continued, \"it has to do with the position of theassemblage point.\"Genaro immediately began to walk around the corridor, arching his back andlifting his thighs to his chest.\"The nagual Julian showed him how to walk that way,\" don Juan said in a whisper,\"it's called the gait of power. Genaro knows several gaits of power. Watch himfixedly.\"Genaro's movements were indeed mesmeric. I found myself following his gait,first with my eyes and then irresistibly with my feet. I imitated his gait. Wewalked once around the patio and stopped.While walking, I had noticed the extraordinary lucidity that each step broughtto me. When we stopped, I was in a state of keen alertness. I could hear everysound. I could detect every change in the light or in the shadows around me. Ibecame enthralled with a feeling of urgency, of impending action. I feltextraordinarily aggressive, muscular, daring.At that moment I saw an enormous span of flat land in front of me. Right behindme I saw a forest. Huge trees were lined up as straight as a wall. The forestwas dark and green. The plain was sunny and yellow.My breathing was deep and strangely accelerated, but not in an abnormal way. Yetit was the rhythm of my breathing that was forcing me to trot on the spot. Iwanted to take off running, or rather my body wanted to, but just as I wastaking off something stopped me.Don Juan and Genaro were suddenly by my side. We walked down the corridor withGenaro to my right. He nudged me with his shoulder. I felt the weight of hisbody on me. He gently shoved me to the left and we angled off straight for theeast wall of the patio. For a moment I had the weird impression that we weregoing to go through the wall, and I even braced myself for the impact; but westopped right in front of the wall.While my face was still against the wall, they both examined me with great care.I knew what they were searching for. They wanted to make sure that I had shiftedmy assemblage point. I knew that I had because my mood had changed. Theyobviously knew it too.They gently took me by the arms and walked in silence with me to the other sideof the corridor to a dark passageway; a narrow hall that connected the patiowith the rest of the house. We stopped there. Don Juan and Genaro moved a fewfeet away from me.I was left facing the side of the house that was in dark shadows. I looked intoan empty dark room. I had a sense of physical weariness. I felt languid,indifferent, and yet I experienced a sense of spiritual strength. I realizedthen that I had lost something. There was no strength in my body. I could hardlystand. My legs finally gave in and I sat down and then I lay down on my side.While I lay there, I had the most wonderful, fulfilling thoughts of love forGod, for goodness.Then all at once I was in front of the main altar of a church. The bas-reliefscovered with gold leaf glittered with the light of thousands of candles. I sawthe dark figures of men and women carrying an enormous crucifix mounted on ahuge palanquin. I moved out of their way and stepped outside the church. I saw amultitude of people- a sea of candles coming toward me. I felt elated. I ran tojoin them. I was moved by profound love. I wanted to be with them, to pray tothe Lord. I was only a few feet away from the mass of people when somethingswished me away.The next instant, I was with don Juan and Genaro. They flanked me as we walkedlazily around the patio.While we were having lunch the next day, don Juan said that Genaro had pushed myassemblage point with his gait of power, and that he had been able to do thatbecause I had been in a state of inner silence. He explained that thearticulation point of everything seers do is something he had talked about sincethe day we met; stopping the internal dialogue. He stressed over and over thatthe internal dialogue is what keeps the assemblage point fixed to its originalposition.\"Once silence is attained, everything is possible,\" he said.I told him I was very conscious of the fact that in general I had stoppedtalking to myself, but did not know how I had done it. If asked to explain theprocedure I would not know what to say.\"The explanation is simplicity itself,\" he said. \"You willed it, and thus youset a new intent, a new command. Then your command became the Eagle's command.\"This is one of the most extraordinary things that the new seers found out: Ourcommand can become the Eagle's command. The internal dialogue stops in the sameway it begins; by an act of will. After all, we are forced to start talking toourselves by those who teach us. As they teach us, they engage their will and weengage ours- both without knowing it. As we learn to talk to ourselves, we learnto handle will. We will ourselves to talk to ourselves. The way to stop talkingto ourselves is to use exactly the same method; we must will it; we must intendit.\"We were silent for a few minutes. I asked him to whom he was referring when hesaid that we had teachers who taught us to talk to ourselves.\"I was talking about what happens to human beings when they are infants,\" hereplied, \"a time when they are taught by everyone around them to repeat anendless dialogue about themselves. The dialogue becomes internalized, and thatforce alone keeps the assemblage point fixed.\"The new seers say that infants have hundreds of teachers who teach them exactlywhere to place their assemblage point.\"He said that seers see that infants have no fixed assemblage point at first.Their encased emanations are in a state of great turmoil, and their assemblagepoints shift everywhere in the band of man, giving children a great capacity tofocus on emanations that later will be thoroughly disregarded. Then as theygrow, the older humans around them, through their considerable power over them,force the children's assemblage points to become more steady by means of anincreasingly complex internal dialogue. The internal dialogue is a process thatconstantly strengthens the position of the assemblage point, because thatposition is an arbitrary one and needs steady reinforceent.\"The fact of the matter is that many children see,\" he went on. \"Most of thosewho see are considered to be oddballs and every effort is made to correct them,to make them solidify the position of their assemblage points.\"\"But would it be possible to encourage children to keep their assemblage pointsmore fluid?\" I asked.\"Only if they live among the new seers,\" he said. \"Otherwise they would getentrapped, as the old seers did, in the intricacies of the silent side of man.And, believe me, that's worse than being caught in the clutches of rationality.\"Don Juan went on to express his profound admiration for the human capacity toimpart order to the chaos of the Eagle's emanations. He maintained that everyone of us, in his own right, is a masterful magician and that our magic is tokeep our assemblage point unwaveringly fixed.\"The force of the emanations at large,\" he went on, \"makes our assemblage pointselect certain emanations and cluster them for alignment and perception. That'sthe command of the Eagle, but all the meaning that we give to what we perceiveis our command, our gift of magic.\"He said that in the light of what he had explained, what Genaro had made me dothe day before was something extraordinarily complex and yet very simple. It wascomplex because it required a tremendous discipline on everybody's part.It required that my internal dialogue be stopped, that I reach a state ofheightened awareness, and that someone walk away with my assemblage point. Theexplanation behind all these complex procedures was very simple. The new seerssay that since the exact position of the assemblage point is an arbitraryposition chosen for us by our ancestors, it can move with a relatively smalleffort. Once it moves, it forces new alignments of emanations, thus newperceptions.\"I used to give you power plants in order to make your assemblage point move,\"don Juan continued. \"Power plants have that effect; but hunger, tiredness,fever, and other things like that can have a similar effect. The flaw of theaverage man is that he thinks the result of a shift is purely mental. It isn't,as you yourself can attest.\"He explained that my assemblage point had shifted scores of times in the past,just as it had shifted the day before, and that most of the time the worlds ithad assembled had been so close to the world of everyday life as to be virtuallyphantom worlds. He emphatically added that visions of that kind areautomatically rejected by the new seers.\"Those visions are the product of man's inventory,\" he went on. \"They are of novalue for warriors in search of total freedom, because they are produced by alateral shift of the assemblage point.\"He stopped talking and looked at me. I knew that by lateral shift he had meant ashift of the point from one side to the other along the width of man's band ofemanations instead of a shift in depth. I asked him if I was right.\"That's exactly what I meant,\" he said. \"On both edges of man's band ofemanations there is a strange storage of refuse, an incalculable pile of humanjunk. It's a very morbid, sinister storehouse. It had great value for the oldseers but not for us.\"One of the easiest things one can do is to fall into it. Yesterday Genaro and Iwanted to give you a quick example of that lateral shift. That was why we walkedyour assemblage point. But any person can reach that storehouse by simplystopping his internal dialogue. If the shift is minimal, the results areexplained as fantasies of the mind. If the shift is considerable, the resultsare called hallucinations.\"I asked him to explain the act of walking the assemblage point. He said thatonce warriors have attained inner silence by stopping their internal dialogue,the sound of the gait of power, more than the sight of it, is what traps theirassemblage points. The rhythm of muffled steps instantly catches the alignmentforce of the emanations inside the cocoon, which has been disconnected by innersilence.\"That force hooks itself immediately to the edges of the band,\" he went on. \"Onthe right edge we find endless visions of physical activity, violence, killing,sensuality. On the left edge we find spirituality, religion, God. Genaro and Iwalked your assemblage point to both edges, so as to give you a complete view ofthat human junk pile.\"Don Juan restated, as if on second thought, that one of the most mysteriousaspects of the seers' knowledge is the incredible effects of inner silence. Hesaid that once inner silence is attained, the bonds that tie the assemblagepoint to the particular spot where it is normally placed begin to break, and theassemblage point is free to move.He said that the movement ordinarily is toward the left, and that such adirectional preference is the natural reaction of most human beings, but thatthere are seers who can direct that movement to positions below the point'scustomary spot. The new seers call that shift \"the shift below.\"\"Seers also suffer accidental shifts below,\" he went on. \"The assemblage pointdoesn't remain there long, and that's fortunate, because that is the place ofthe beast. To go below is counter to our interest, although the easiest thing todo.\"Don Juan also said that among the many errors of judgment the old seers hadcommitted, one of the most grievous was moving their assemblage points to theimmeasurable area below, which made them experts at adopting animal forms. Theychose different animals as their point of reference and called those animalstheir nagual. They believed that by moving their assemblage points to specificspots they would acquire the characteristics of the animal of their choice; itsstrength, wisdom, cunning, agility, or ferocity.Don Juan assured me that there are many dreadful examples of such practices evenamong the seers of our day. The relative facility with which the assemblagepoint of man moves toward any lower position poses a great temptation to seers,especially to those whose inclination leans toward that end. It is the duty of anagual, therefore, to test his warriors.He told me then that he had put me to the test by moving my assemblage point toa position below, while I was under the influence of a power plant. He thenguided my assemblage point until I could isolate the crows' band of emanations,which resulted in my changing into a crow.I again asked don Juan the question I had asked him dozens of times. I wanted toknow whether I had physically turned into a crow, or had merely thought and feltlike one. He explained that a shift of the assemblage point to the area belowalways results in a total transformation. He added that if the assemblage pointmoves beyond a crucial threshold, the world vanishes. It ceases to be what it isto us at man's level.He conceded that my transformation was indeed horrifying by any standards. Myreaction to that experience proved to him that I had no leanings toward thatdirection. Had it not been that way, I would have had to employ enormous energyin order to fight off a tendency to remain in that area below which some seersfind most comfortable.He further said that an unwitting downshift occurs periodically to every seer,but that such a downshift becomes less and less frequent as their assemblagepoints move farther toward the left. Every time it occurs, however, the power ofa seer undergoing it diminishes considerably. It is a drawback that takes timeand great effort to correct.\"Those lapses make seers extremely morose and narrow-minded,\" he continued, \"andin certain cases, extremely rational.\"\"How can seers avoid those downshifts?\" I asked.\"It all depends on the warrior,\" he said. \"Some of them are naturally inclinedto indulge in their quirks- you, for instance. They are the ones who are hardhit. For those like you, I recommend a twenty-four hour vigil of everything theydo. Disciplined men or women are less prone to that kind of shift. For them Iwould recommend a twenty-three hour vigil.\"He looked at me with shiny eyes and laughed.\"Female seers have downshifts more often than males,\" he said. \"But they arealso capable of bouncing out of that position with no effort at all, while maleslinger dangerously in it.\"He also said that women seers have an extraordinary capacity to make theirassemblage points hold on to any position in the area below. Men cannot. Menhave sobriety and purpose, but very little talent. That is the reason why anagual must have eight women seers in his party. Women give the impulse to crossthe immeasurable vastness of the unknown. Together with that natural capacity,or as a consequence of it, women have a most fierce intensity. They can,therefore, reproduce an animal form with flare, ease, and a matchless ferocity.\"If you think about scary things,\" he continued, \"about something unnamablelurking in the darkness, you're thinking without knowing it about a woman seerholding a position in the immeasurable area below. True horror lies right there.If you ever find an aberrant woman seer, run for the hills!\"I asked him whether other organisms were capable of shifting their assemblagepoints.\"Their points can shift,\" he said, \"but the shift is not a voluntary thing withthem.\"\"Is the assemblage point of other organisms also trained to appear where itdoes?\" I asked.\"Every newborn organism is trained, one way or another,\" he replied. \"We may notunderstand how their training is done- after all, we don't even understand howit is done to us- but seers see that the newborn are coaxed to do what theirkind does. That's exactly what happens to human infants. Seers see theirassemblage points shifting every which way and then they see how the presence ofadults fastens each point to one spot. The same happens to every otherorganism.\"Don Juan seemed to reflect for a moment and then added that there was indeed oneunique effect that man's assemblage point has. He pointed to a tree outside.\"When we, as serious adult human beings, look at a tree,\" he said, \"ourassemblage points align an infinite number of emanations and achieve a miracle.Our assemblage points make us perceive a cluster of emanations that we calltree.\"He explained that the assemblage point not only effects the alignment needed forperception, but also obliterates the alignment of certain emanations in order toarrive at a greater refinement of perception, a skimming, a tricky humanconstruct with no parallel.He said that the new seers had observed that only human beings were capable offurther clustering the clusters of emanations. He used the Spanish word forskimming, desnate, to describe the act of collecting the most palatable creamoff the top of a container of boiled milk after it cools. Likewise, in terms ofperception, man's assemblage point takes some part of the emanations alreadyselected for alignment and makes a more palatable construct with it.\"The skimmings of men,\" don Juan continued, \"are more real than what othercreatures perceive. That is our pitfall. They are so real to us that we forgetwe have constructed them by commanding our assemblage points to appear wherethey do. We forget they are real to us only because it is our command toperceive them as real. We have the power to skim the top off the alignments, butwe don't have the power to protect ourselves from our own commands. That has tobe learned. To give our skimmings a free hand, as we do, is an error of judgmentfor which we pay as dearly as the old seers paid for theirs.\"==============================================================="},{"pageContent":"9. The Shift BelowDon Juan and Genaro made their yearly trip to the northern part of Mexico, tothe Sonoran desert, to look for medicinal plants. One of the seers of thenagual's party, Vicente Medrano, the herbalist among them, used those plants tomake medicines.I had joined don Juan and Genaro in Sonora, at the last stage of their journeyjust in time to drive them south back to their home.The day before we started on our drive, don Juan abruptly continued hisexplanation of the mastery of awareness. We were resting in the shade of sometall bushes in the foothills of the mountains. It was late afternoon; almostdark. Each of us had been carrying a large burlap sack filled with plants. Assoon as we had put them down, Genaro lay down on the ground and fell asleepusing his folded jacket as a pillow.Don Juan spoke to me in a low voice as if he didn't want to wake up Genaro. Hesaid that by now he had explained most of the truths about awareness, and thatthere was only one truth left to discuss. The last truth, he assured me, was thebest of the old seers' findings although they never knew that themselves. Itstremendous value was only recognized ages later by the new seers.\"I've explained to you that man has an assemblage point,\" he went on, \"and thatthat assemblage point aligns emanations for perception. We've also discussedthat that point moves from its fixed position. Now, the last truth is that oncethat assemblage point moves beyond a certain limit, it can assemble worldsentirely different from the world we know.\"Still in a whisper, he said that certain geographical areas not only help thatprecarious movement of the assemblage point, but also select specific directionsfor that movement. For instance, the Sonoran desert helps the assemblage pointmove downward from its customary position, to the place of the beast.\"That's why there are true sorcerers in Sonora,\" he continued. \"Especiallysorceresses. You already know one, la Catalina. In the past, I have arrangedbouts between the two of you. I wanted to make your assemblage point shift, andla Catalina, with her sorcery antics, jolted it loose.\"Don Juan explained that the chilling experiences I had had with la Catalina hadbeen part of a prearranged agreement between the two of them.\"What would you think if we invited her to join us?\" Genaro asked me in a loudvoice, as he sat up.The abruptness of his question and the strange sound of his voice plunged meinto instant terror.Don Juan laughed and shook me by the arms. He assured me that there was no needfor alarm. He said that la Catalina was like a cousin or an aunt to us. She waspart of our world, although she did not quite follow our quests. She wasinfinitely closer to the ancient seers.Genaro smiled and winked at me.\"I understand that you've got hot pants for her,\" he said to me. \"She herselfconfessed to me that every time you have had a confrontation with her, thegreater your fright, the hotter your pants.\"Don Juan and Genaro laughed to near hysteria.I had to admit that somehow I had always found la Catalina to be a very scarybut at the same time an extremely appealing woman. What impressed me the mostabout her was her exuding energy.\"She has so much energy saved,\" don Juan commented, \"that you didn't have to bein heightened awareness for her to move your assemblage point all the way to thedepths of the left side.\"Don Juan said again that la Catalina was very closely related to us, because shebelonged to the nagual Julian's party. He explained that usually the nagual andall the members of his party leave the world together, but that there areinstances when they leave either in smaller groups or one by one. The nagualJulian and his party were an example of the latter. Although he had left theworld nearly forty years ago, la Catalina was still here.He reminded me about something he mentioned to me before; that the nagualJulian's party consisted of a group of three thoroughly inconsequential men andeight superb women. Don Juan had always maintained that such a disparity was oneof the reasons why the members of the nagual Julian's party left the world oneby one.He said that la Catalina had been attached to one of the superb women seers ofthe nagual Julian's party, who taught her extraordinary maneuvers to shift herassemblage point to the area below. That seer was one of the last to leave theworld. She lived to an extremely old age, and since both she and la Catalinawere originally from Sonora, they returned, in her advanced years, to the desertand lived together until the seer left the world. In the years they spenttogether, la Catalina became her most dedicated helper and disciple, a disciplewho was willing to learn the extravagant ways the old seers knew to make theassemblage point shift.I asked don Juan if la Catalina's knowledge was inherently different from hisown.\"We are exactly the same,\" he replied. \"She's more like Silvio Manuel or Genaro.She is really the female version of them, but, of course, being a woman she'sinfinitely more aggressive and dangerous than both of them.\"Genaro assented with a nod of his head. \"Infinitely more,\" he said and winkedagain.\"Is she attached to your party?\" I asked don Juan.I said that she's like a cousin or an aunt to us,\" he replied. \"I meant shebelongs to the older generation, although she's younger than all of us. She isthe last of that group. She is rarely in contact with us. She doesn't quite likeus. We are too stiff for her, because she's used to the nagual Julian's touch.She prefers the high adventure of the unknown to the quest for freedom.\"What is the difference between the two?\" I asked don Juan.\"In the last part of my explanation of the truths about awareness,\" he replied,\"we are going to discuss that difference slowly and thoroughly. What's importantfor you to know at this moment, is that you're jealously guarding weird secretsin your left-side awareness. That is why la Catalina and you like each other.\"I insisted again that it was not that I liked her, it was rather that I admiredher great strength.Don Juan and Genaro laughed and patted me as if they knew something I did not.\"She likes you because she knows what you're like,\" Genaro said and smacked hislips. \"She knew the nagual Julian very well.\"Both of them gave me a long look that made me feel embarrassed.\"What are you driving at?\" I asked Genaro in a belligerent tone.He grinned at me and moved his eyebrows up and down in a comical gesture. But hekept quiet.Don Juan spoke and broke the silence.\"There are very strange points in common between the nagual Julian and you,\" hesaid. \"Genaro is just trying to figure out if you're aware of it.\"I asked both of them how on earth I would be aware of something so farfetched.\"La Catalina thinks you are,\" Genaro said. \"She says so because she knew thenagual Julian better than any of us here.\"I commented that I couldn't believe that she knew the nagual Julian, since hehad left the world nearly forty years ago.\"La Catalina is no spring chicken,\" Genaro said. \"She just looks young. That'spart of her knowledge; just as it was part of the nagual Julian's knowledge.You've seen her only when she looks young. If you see her when she looks old,she'll scare the living daylights out of you.\"\"What la Catalina does,\" don Juan interrupted, \"can be explained only in termsof the three masteries: the mastery of awareness, the mastery of stalking, andthe mastery of intent.\"But today we are going to examine what she does only in light of the last truthabout awareness; the truth that says that the assemblage point can assembleworlds different from our own after it moves from its original position.\"Don Juan signaled me to get up. Genaro also stood up. I automatically grabbedthe burlap sack filled with medicinal plants. Genaro stopped me as I was aboutto put it on my shoulders.\"Leave the sack alone,\" he said, smiling. \"We have to take a little hike up thehill and meet la Catalina.\"\"Where is she?\" I asked.\"Up there,\" Genaro said, pointing to the top of a small hill. \"If you stare withyour eyes half-closed, you'll see her as a very dark spot against the greenshrubbery.\"I strained to see the dark spot, but I couldn't see anything.\"Why don't you walk up there?\" don Juan suggested to me.I felt dizzy and sick to my stomach. Don Juan urged me with a movement of hishand to go up, but I didn't dare move. Finally, Genaro took me by the arm andboth of us climbed toward the top of the hill. When we got there, I realizedthat don Juan had come up right behind us. The three of us reached the top atthe same time.Don Juan very calmly began to talk to Genaro. He asked him if he remembered themany times the nagual Julian was about to choke both of them to death becausethey indulged in their fears.Genaro turned to me and assured me that the nagual Julian had been a ruthlessteacher. The nagual Julian and his own teacher, the nagual Elias who was stillin the world then, used to push everyone's assemblage points beyond a cruciallimit and let them fend for themselves.\"I once told you,\" Genaro went on, \"that the nagual Julian recommended we notwaste our sexual energy. He meant that for the assemblage point to shift, oneneeds energy. If one doesn't have it, the nagual's blow is not the blow offreedom but the blow of death.\"\"Without enough energy,\" don Juan said, \"the force of alignment is crushing. Youhave to have energy to sustain the pressure of alignments which never take placeunder ordinary circumstances.\"Genaro said that the nagual Julian was an inspiring teacher. He always foundways to teach and at the same time entertain himself. One of his favoriteteaching devices was to catch them unawares once or twice in their normalawareness, and make their assemblage points shift. From then on, all he had todo to have their undivided attention was to threaten them with an unexpectednagual's blow.\"The nagual Julian was really an unforgettable man,\" don Juan said. \"He had agreat touch with people. He would do the worst things in the world, but done byhim they were great. Done by anyone else they would have been crude and callous.\"The nagual Elias, on the other hand, had no touch, but he was indeed a great,great teacher.\"\"The nagual Elias was very much like the nagual Juan Matus,\" Genaro said to me.\"They got along very fine. And the nagual Elias taught him everything withoutever raising his voice, or playing tricks on him.\"But the nagual Julian was quite different,\" Genaro went on, giving me afriendly shove. \"I'd say that he jealously guarded strange secrets in his leftside, just like you.He asked don Juan, \"Wouldn't you say so?\"Don Juan did not answer, but nodded affirmatively. He seemed to be holding backhis laughter.\"He had a playful nature,\" don Juan said, and both of them broke into a greatlaughter.The fact that they were obviously alluding to something they knew made me feeleven more threatened.Don Juan matter-of-factly said that they were referring to the bizarre sorcerytechniques that the nagual Julian had learned in the course of his life. Genaroadded that the nagual Julian had a unique teacher besides the nagual Elias. Ateacher who had liked him immensely and had taught him novel and complex ways ofmoving his assemblage point. As a result of this, the nagual Julian wasextraordinarily eccentric in his behavior.\"Who was that teacher, don Juan?\" I asked.Don Juan and Genaro looked at each other and giggled like two children.\"That is a very tough question to answer,\" don Juan replied. \"All I can say isthat he was the teacher that deviated the course of our line. He taught us manythings, good and bad, but among the worst, he taught us what the old seers did.So, some of us got trapped. The nagual Julian was one of them, and so is laCatalina. We only hope that you won't follow them.\"I immediately began to protest. Don Juan interrupted me. He said that I did notknow what I was protesting.As don Juan spoke, I became terribly angry with him and Genaro. Suddenly, I wasraging; yelling at them at the top of my voice. My reaction was so out of tonewith me that it scared me. It was as if I were someone else. I stopped andlooked at them for help.Genaro had his hands on don Juan's shoulders as if he needed support. Both ofthem were laughing uncontrollably.I became so despondent I was nearly in tears. Don Juan came to my side. Hereassuringly put his hand on my shoulder. He said that the Sonoran desert, forreasons incomprehensible to him, fostered definite belligerence in man or anyother organism.\"People may say that it's because the air is too dry here,\" he continued, \"orbecause it's too hot. Seers would say that there is a particular confluence ofthe Eagle's emanations here which, as I've already said, helps the assemblagepoint to shift below.\"Be that as it may, warriors are in the world to train themselves to be unbiasedwitnesses so as to understand the mystery of ourselves, and relish theexultation of finding what we really are. This is the highest of the new seers'goals. And not every warrior attains it. We believe that the nagual Juliandidn't attain it. He was waylaid, and so was la Catalina.\"He further said that to be a peerless nagual, one has to love freedom, and onehas to have supreme detachment. He explained that what makes the warrior's pathso very dangerous is that it is the opposite of the life situation of modernman. He said that modern man has left the realm of the unknown and themysterious, and has settled down in the realm of the functional. He has turnedhis back to the world of the foreboding and the exulting, and has welcomed theworld of boredom.\"To be given a chance to go back again to the mystery of the world,\" don Juancontinued, \"is sometimes too much for warriors, and they succumb. They arewaylaid by what I've called the high adventure of the unknown. They forget thequest for freedom. They forget to be unbiased witnesses. They sink into theunknown and love it.\"\"And you think I'm like that, don't you?\" I asked don Juan.\"We don't think, we know,\" Genaro replied. \"And la Catalina knows better thananyone else.\"\"Why would she know it?\" I demanded.\"Because she's like you,\" Genaro replied, pronouncing his words with a comicalintonation.I was about to get into a heated argument again when don Juan interrupted me.\"There's no need to get so worked up,\" he said to me. \"You are what you are. Thefight for freedom is harder for some. You are one of them.\"In order to be unbiased witnesses,\" he went on, \"we begin by understanding thatthe fixation or the movement of the assemblage point is all there is to us andthe world we witness; whatever that world might be.\"The new seers say that when we were taught to talk to ourselves, we were taughtthe means to dull ourselves in order to keep the assemblage point fixed on onespot.\"Genaro clapped his hands noisily, and let out a piercing whistle that imitatedthe whistle of a football coach.\"Let's get that assemblage point moving!\" he yelled. \"Up, up, up! Move, move,move!\"We were all still laughing when the bushes by my right side were suddenlystirred. Don Juan and Genaro immediately sat down with the left leg tucked underthe seat. The right leg with the knee up was like a shield in front of them. DonJuan signaled me to do the same. He raised his brows and made a gesture ofresignation at the corner of his mouth.\"Sorcerers have their own quirks,\" he said in a whisper. \"When the assemblagepoint moves to the regions below its normal position, the vision of sorcerersbecomes limited. If they see you standing, they'll attack you.\"\"The nagual Julian kept me once for two days in this warrior's position,\" Genarowhispered to me. \"I even had to urinate while I sat in this position.\"\"And defecate,\" don Juan added.\"Right,\" Genaro said. And then he whispered to me, as if on second thought, \"Ihope you did your kaka earlier. If your bowels aren't empty when la Catalinashows up, you'll shit in your pants; unless I show you how to take them off. Ifyou need to shit in this position, you've got to get your pants off.\"He began to show me how to maneuver out of my trousers. He did it in a mostserious and concerned manner. All my concentration was focused on his movements.It was only when I had gotten out of my pants that I became aware that don Juanwas roaring with laughter.I realized that Genaro was again poking fun at me. I was about to stand up toput on my pants, when don Juan stopped me. He was laughing so hard that he couldhardly articulate his words. He told me to stay put, that Genaro did things onlyhalf in fun, and that la Catalina was really there behind the bushes.His tone of urgency, in the midst of laughter, got to me. I froze on the spot. Amoment later a rustle in the bushes sent me into such a panic that I forgotabout my pants. I looked at Genaro. He was again wearing his pants. He shruggedhis shoulders.\"I'm sorry,\" he whispered. \"I didn't have time to show you how to put them backon without getting up.\"I did not have time to get angry or to join them in their mirth. Suddenly, rightin front of me, the bushes separated and a most horrendous creature came out. Itwas so outlandish I was no longer afraid. I was spellbound.Whatever was in front of me was not a human being. It was something not evenremotely resembling one. It was more like a reptile. Or a bulky grotesqueinsect. Or even a hairy, ultimately repulsive bird. Its body was dark and hadcoarse reddish hair. I could not see any legs, just the ugly enormous head. Thenose was flat and the nostrils were two enormous lateral holes. It had somethinglike a beak with teeth. Horrifying as that thing was, its eyes were magnificent.They were like two mesmeric pools of inconceivable clarity. They had knowledge.They were not human eyes, or bird eyes, or any kind of eyes I had ever seen.The creature moved toward my left, rustling the bushes. As I moved my head tofollow it, I noticed that don Juan and Genaro seemed to be as spellbound by itspresence as I was. It occurred to me that they had never seen anything like thateither.In an instant, the creature had moved completely out of sight. But a momentlater there was a growl, and its gigantic shape again loomed in front of us.I was fascinated and at the same time worried by the fact that I was not in theleast afraid of that grotesque creature. It was as if my early panic had beenexperienced by someone else.I felt, at one moment, that I was beginning to stand up. Against my volition, mylegs straightened up and I found myself standing up, facing the creature. Ivaguely felt that I was taking off my jacket, my shirt, and my shoes. Then I wasnaked. The muscles of my legs tensed with a tremendously powerful contraction. Ijumped up and down with colossal agility, and then the creature and I racedtoward some ineffable greenness in the distance.The creature raced ahead of me, coiling on itself, like a serpent. But then Icaught up with it. As we speeded together, I became aware of something I alreadyknew; the creature was really la Catalina. All of a sudden, la Catalina, in theflesh, was next to me. We moved effortlessly. It was as if we were stationary,only posed in a bodily gesture of movement and speed, while the scenery aroundus was being moved, giving the impression of enormous acceleration.Our racing stopped as suddenly as it had started, and then I was alone with laCatalina in a different world. There was not a single recognizable feature init. There was an intense glare and heat coming from what seemed to be theground, a ground covered with huge rocks. Or at least they seemed to be rocks.They had the color of sandstone, but they had no weight. They were like chunksof sponge tissue. I could send them hurling around by only leaning on them.I became so fascinated with my strength that I was oblivious to anything else. Ihad assessed, in whatever way, that the chunks of seemingly weightless materialopposed resistance to me. It was my superior strength that sent them hurlingaround.I tried to grab them with my hands, and I realized that my entire body hadchanged. La Catalina was looking at me. She was again the grotesque creature shehad been before, and so was I. I could not see myself, but I knew that both ofus were exactly alike.An indescribable joy possessed me as if joy were some force that came fromoutside me. La Catalina and I cavorted, and twisted, and played until I had nomore thoughts, or feelings, or human awareness in any degree. Yet, I wasdefinitely aware. My awareness was a vague knowledge that gave me confidence. Itwas a limitless trust; a physical certainty of my existence; not in the sense ofa human feeling of individuality, but in the sense of a presence that waseverything.Then, everything came again into human focus all at once. La Catalina washolding my hand. We were walking on the desert floor among the desert shrubs. Ihad the immediate and painful realization that the desert rocks and hard clumpsof dirt were horribly injurious to my bare feet.We came to a spot clear of vegetation. Don Juan and Genaro were there. I satdown and put on my clothes.My experience with la Catalina delayed our trip back to the south of Mexico. Ithad unhinged me in some indescribable way. In my normal state of awareness, Ibecame disassociated. It was as if I had lost a point of reference. I had becomedespondent. I told don Juan that I had even lost my desire to live.We were sitting around in the ramada of don Juan's house. My car was loaded withsacks and we were ready to leave, but my feeling of despair got the best of meand I began to weep.Don Juan and Genaro laughed until their eyes were tearing. The more desperate Ifelt, the greater was their enjoyment. Finally, don Juan had me shift intoheightened awareness and explained that their laughter was not unkindness ontheir part, or the result of a weird sense of humor, but the genuine expressionof happiness at seeing me advance in the path of knowledge.\"I'll tell you what the nagual Julian used to say to us when we got to where youare,\" don Juan went on. \"That way, you'll know that you're not alone. What'shappening to you happens to anyone who stores enough energy to catch a glimpseof the unknown.\"He said that the nagual Julian used to tell them that they had been evicted fromthe homes where they had lived all their lives. A result of having saved energyhad been the disruption of their cozy but utterly limiting and boring nest inthe world of everyday life. Their depression, the nagual Julian told them, wasnot so much the sadness of having lost their nest, but the annoyance of havingto look for new quarters.\"The new quarters,\" don Juan went on, \"are not as cozy. But they are infinitelymore roomy.\"Your eviction notice came in the form of a great depression, a loss of thedesire to live, just as it happened to us. When you told us that you didn't wantto live, we couldn't help laughing.\"\"What's going to happen to me now?\" I asked.\"Using the vernacular, you got to get another pad,\" don Juan replied.Don Juan and Genaro again entered into a state of great euphoria. Every one oftheir statements and remarks made them laugh hysterically.\"It's all very simple,\" don Juan said. \"Your new level of energy will create anew spot to house your assemblage point. And the warriors' dialogue you carry onwith us every time we get together will solidify that new position.\"Genaro adopted a serious look and in a booming voice he asked me, \"Did you shittoday?\"He urged me with a movement of his head to answer.\"Did you, did you?\" he demanded. \"Let's get going with our warriors' dialogue.\"When their laughter had subsided, Genaro said that I had to be aware of adrawback; the fact that from time to time the assemblage point returns to itsoriginal position. He told me that in his own case, the normal position of hisassemblage point had forced him to see people as threatening and oftenterrifying beings. To his utter amazement, one day he realized that he hadchanged. He was considerably more daring and had successfully dealt with asituation that would have ordinarily thrown him into chaos and fear.\"I found myself making love,\" Genaro continued, and he winked at me. \"Usually Iwas afraid to death of women. But one day I found myself in bed with a mostferocious woman, it was so unlike me that when I realized what I was doing Inearly had a heart attack. The jolt made my assemblage point return to itsmiserable normal position and I had to run out of the house, shaking like ascared rabbit.\"You'd better watch out for the recoil of the assemblage point,\" Genaro added,and they were laughing again.\"The position of the assemblage point on man's cocoon,\" don Juan explained, \"ismaintained by the internal dialogue, and because of that, it is a flimsyposition at best. That's why men and women lose their minds so easily,especially those whose internal dialogue is repetitious, boring, and without anydepth.\"The new seers say that the more resilient human beings are those whose internaldialogue is more fluid and varied.\"He said that the position of the warrior's assemblage point is infinitelystronger, because as soon as the assemblage point begins to move in the cocoon,it creates a dimple in the luminosity, a dimple that houses the assemblage pointfrom then on.\"That's the reason why we can't say that warriors lose their minds,\" don Juanwent on. \"If they lose anything, they lose their dimple.\"Don Juan and Genaro found that statement so hilarious that they rolled on thefloor laughing.I asked don Juan to explain my experience with la Catalina. And both of themagain howled with laughter.\"Women are definitely more bizarre than men,\" don Juan finally said. \"The factthat they have an extra opening between their legs makes them fall prey tostrange influences. Strange, powerful forces possess them through that opening.That's the only way I can understand their quirks.\"He kept silent for a while, and I asked what he meant by that.\"La Catalina came to us as a giant worm,\" he replied.Don Juan's expression when he said that, and Genaro's explosion of laughter,took me into sheer mirth. I laughed until I was nearly sick.Don Juan said that la Catalina's skill was so extraordinary that she could doanything she wanted in the realm of the beast. Her unparalleled display had beenmotivated by her affinity with me. The final result of all that, he said, wasthat la Catalina pulled my assemblage point with her.\"What did you two do as worms?\" Genaro asked and slapped me on the back.Don Juan seemed to be close to choking with laughter.\"That's why I've said that women are more bizarre than men,\" he commented atlast.\"I don't agree with you,\" Genaro said to don Juan. \"The nagual Julian didn'thave an extra hole between his legs and he was more weird than la Catalina. Ibelieve she learned the worm bit from him. He used to do that to her.\"Don Juan jumped up and down, like a child who is trying to keep from wetting hispants.When he had regained a measure of calm, don Juan said that the nagual Julian hada knack for creating and exploiting the most bizarre situations. He also saidthat la Catalina had given me a superb example of the shift below. She had letme see her as the being whose form she had adopted by moving her assemblagepoint, and she had then helped me move mine to the same position that gave herher monstrous appearance.\"The other teacher that the nagual Julian had,\" don Juan went on, \"taught himhow to get to specific spots in that immensity of the area below. None of uscould follow him there, but all the members of his party did, especially laCatalina and the woman seer who taught her.\"Don Juan further said that a shift below entailed a view, not of another worldproper, but of our same world of everyday life seen from a differentperspective. He added that in order for me to see another world I had toperceive another great band of the Eagle's emanations.He then brought his explanation to an end. He said that he had no time toelaborate on the subject of the great bands of emanations, because we had to beon our way. I wanted to stay a bit longer and keep on talking, but he arguedthat he would need a good deal of time to explain that topic and I would needfresh concentration. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"10. Great Bands of EmanationsDays later, in his house in southern Mexico, don Juan continued with hisexplanation. He took me to the big room. It was early evening. The room was indarkness. I wanted to light the gasoline lanterns, but don Juan would not letme. He said that I had to let the sound of his voice move my assemblage point sothat it would glow on the emanations of total concentration and total recall.He then told me that we were going to talk about the great bands of emanations.He called it another key discovery that the old seers made; but in theiraberration they had relegated it to oblivion until it was rescued by the newseers.\"The Eagle's emanations are always grouped in clusters,\" he went on. \"The oldseers called those clusters the great bands of emanations. They aren't reallybands, but the name stuck.\"For instance, there is an immeasurable cluster that produces organic beings.The emanations of that organic band have a sort of fluffiness. They aretransparent and have a unique light of their own, a peculiar energy. They areaware, they jump. That's the reason why all organic beings are filled with apeculiar consuming energy.\"The other bands are darker, less fluffy. Some of them have no light at all, butrather a quality of opaqueness.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that all organic beings have the same kind of emanationsinside their cocoons?\" I asked.\"No. I don't mean that. It isn't really that simple, although organic beings allbelong to the same great band. Think of it as an enormously wide band ofluminous filaments; luminous strings with no end. Organic beings are bubblesthat grow around a group of luminous filaments. Imagine that in this band oforganic life some bubbles are formed around the luminous filaments in the centerof the band. Others are formed close to the edges. The band is wide enough toaccommodate every kind of organic being with room to spare. In such anarrangement, bubbles that are close to the edges of the band miss altogether theemanations that are in the center of the band which are shared only by bubblesthat are aligned with the center. By the same token, bubbles in the center missthe emanations from the edges.\"As you may understand, organic beings share the emanations of one band. Yetseers see that within that organic band, beings are as different as they canbe.\"\"Are there many of these great bands?\" I asked.\"As many as infinity itself,\" he replied. \"Seers have found out, however, thatin the earth there are only forty-eight such bands.\"\"What is the meaning of that, don Juan?\"\"For seers it means that there are forty-eight types of organizations on theearth, forty-eight types of clusters or structures. Organic life is one ofthem.\"\"Does that mean that there are forty-seven types of inorganic life?\"\"No, not at all. The old seers counted seven bands that produced inorganicbubbles of awareness. In other words, there are forty bands that produce bubbleswithout awareness. Those are bands that generate only organization.\"Think of the great bands as being like trees. All of them bear fruit. Theyproduce containers filled with emanations, yet only eight of those trees bearedible fruit- that is, bubbles of awareness. Seven have sour fruit, but ediblenonetheless. And one has the most juicy, luscious fruit there is.\"He laughed and said that in his analogy he had taken the point of view of theEagle, for whom the most delectable morsels are the organic bubbles ofawareness.\"What makes those eight bands produce awareness?\" I asked.\"The Eagle bestows awareness through its emanations,\" he replied.His answer made me argue with him. I told him that to say that the Eagle bestowsawareness through its emanations is like what a religious man would say aboutGod, that God bestows life through love. It does not mean anything.\"The two statements are not made from the same point of view,\" he patientlysaid. \"And yet I think they mean the same thing. The difference is that seerssee how the Eagle bestows awareness through its emanations and religious mendon't see how God bestows life through his love.\"He said that the way the Eagle bestows awareness is by means of three giantbundles of emanations that run through eight great bands. These bundles arequite peculiar, because they make seers feel a hue. One bundle gives the feelingof being beige-pink, something like the glow of pink-colored street lamps.Another gives the feeling of being peach, like buff neon lights. The thirdbundle gives the feeling of being amber, like clear honey.\"So, it is a matter of seeing a hue when seers see that the Eagle bestowsawareness through its emanations,\" he went on. \"Religious men don't see God'slove, but if they would see it, they would know that it is either pink, peach,or amber.\"Man, for example, is attached to the amber bundle, but so are other beings.\"I wanted to know which beings shared those emanations with man.\"Details like that you will have to find out for yourself through your ownseeing,\" he said. \"There is no point in my telling you which ones. You will onlybe making another inventory. Suffice it to say that finding that out foryourself will be one of the most exciting things you'll ever do.\"\"Do the pink and peach bundles also show in man?\" I asked.\"Never. Those bundles belong to other living beings,\" he replied.I was about to ask a question, but with a forceful movement of his hand, hesignaled me to stop. He then became immersed in thought. We were enveloped incomplete silence for a long time.\"I've told you that the glow of awareness in man has different colors.\" hefinally said. \"What I didn't tell you then, because we hadn't gotten to thatpoint yet, was that they are not colors but casts of amber.\"He said that the amber bundle of awareness has an infinitude of subtle variants,which always denote differences in quality of awareness. Pink and pale-greenamber are the most common casts. Blue amber is more unusual, but pure amber isby far the most rare.\"What determines the particular casts of amber?\"\"Seers say that the amount of energy that one saves and stores determines thecast. Countless numbers of warriors have begun with an ordinary pink amber castand have finished with the purest of all ambers. Genaro and Silvio Manuel areexamples of that.\"\"What forms of life belong to the pink and the peach bundles of awareness?\" Iasked.\"The three bundles with all their casts crisscross the eight bands,\" he replied.\"In the organic band, the pink bundle belongs mainly to plants, the peach bandbelongs to insects, and the amber band belongs to man and other animals.\"The same situation is prevalent in the inorganic bands. The three bundles ofawareness produce specific kinds of inorganic beings in each of the seven greatbands.\"I asked him to elaborate on the kinds of inorganic beings that existed.\"That is another thing that you must see for yourself,\" he said. \"The sevenbands and what they produce are indeed inaccessible to human reason, but not tohuman seeing.\"I told him that I could not quite grasp his explanation of the great bands,because his description had forced me to imagine them as independent bundles ofstrings, or even as flat bands, like conveyor belts.He explained that the great bands are neither flat nor round, but indescribablyclustered together, like a pile of hay, which is held together in midair by theforce of the hand that pitched it. Thus, there is no order to the emanations. Tosay that there is a central part or that there are edges is misleading, butnecessary to understanding.Continuing, he explained that inorganic beings produced by the seven other bandsof awareness are characterized by having a container that has no motion. It israther a formless receptacle with a low degree of luminosity. It does not looklike the cocoon of organic beings. It lacks the tautness, the inflated qualitythat makes organic beings look like luminous balls bursting with energy.Don Juan said that the only similarity between inorganic and organic beings isthat all of them have the awareness bestowing pink or peach or amber emanations.\"Those emanations, under certain circumstances,\" he continued, \"make possiblethe most fascinating communication between the beings of those eight greatbands.\"He said that usually the organic beings with their greater fields of energy arethe initiators of communication with inorganic beings, but a subtle andsophisticated follow-up is always the province of the inorganic beings. Once thebarrier is broken, inorganic beings change and become what seers call allies.From that moment inorganic beings can anticipate the seer's most subtle thoughtsor moods or fears.\"The old seers became mesmerized by such devotion from their allies,\" he wenton. \"Stories are that the old seers could make their allies do anything theywanted. That was one of the reasons they believed in their own invulnerability.They got fooled by their self-importance. The allies have power only if theseers who see them are paragons of impeccability; and those old seers justweren't.\"\"Are there as many inorganic beings as there are living organisms?\" I asked.He said that inorganic beings are not as plentiful as organic ones, but thatthis is offset by the greater number of bands of inorganic awareness. Also, thedifferences among the inorganic beings themselves are more vast than thedifferences among organisms, because organisms belong to only one band whileinorganic beings belong to seven bands.\"Besides, inorganic beings live infinitely longer than organisms,\" he continued.\"This matter is what prompted the old seers to concentrate their seeing on theallies, for reasons I will tell you about later on.\"He said that the old seers also came to realize that it is the high energy oforganisms and the subsequent high development of their awareness that make themdelectable morsels for the Eagle. In the old seers' view, gluttony was thereason the Eagle produced as many organisms as possible.He explained next that the product of the other forty great bands is notawareness at all, but a configuration of inanimate energy. The old seers choseto call whatever is produced by those bands, vessels. While cocoons andcontainers are fields of energetic awareness, which accounts for theirindependent luminosity, vessels are rigid receptacles that hold emanationswithout being fields of energetic awareness. Their luminosity comes only fromthe energy of the encased emanations.\"You must bear in mind that everything on the earth is encased,\" he continued.\"Whatever we perceive is made up of portions of cocoons or vessels withemanations. Ordinarily, we don't perceive the containers of inorganic beings atall.\"He looked at me, waiting for a sign of comprehension. When he realized I was notgoing to oblige him, he continued explaining.\"The total world is made of the forty-eight bands,\" he said. \"The world that ourassemblage point assembles for our normal perception is made up of two bands;one is the organic band, the other is a band that has only structure, but noawareness. The other forty-six great bands are not part of the world we normallyperceive.\"He paused again for pertinent questions. I had none.\"There are other complete worlds that our assemblage points can assemble,\" hewent on. \"The old seers counted seven such worlds, one for each band ofawareness. I'll add that two of those worlds, besides the world of everydaylife, are easy to assemble; the other five are something else.\" When we again sat down to talk, don Juan immediately began to talk about myexperience with la Catalina. He said that a shift of the assemblage point to thearea below its customary position allows the seer a detailed and narrow view ofthe world we know. So detailed is that view that it seems to be an entirelydifferent world. It is a mesmerizing view that has a tremendous appeal,especially for those seers who have an adventurous but somehow indolent and lazyspirit.\"The change of perspective is very pleasant,\" don Juan went on. \"Minimal effortis required, and the results are staggering. If a seer is driven by quick gain,there is no better maneuver than the shift below. The only problem is that inthose positions of the assemblage point, seers are plagued by death, whichhappens even more brutally and more quickly than in man's position.\"The nagual Julian thought it was a great place for cavorting, but that's all.\"He said that a true change of worlds happens only when the assemblage pointmoves into man's band, deep enough to reach a crucial threshold, at which stagethe assemblage point can use another of the great bands.\"How does it use it?\" I asked.He shrugged his shoulders. \"It's a matter of energy,\" he said. \"The force ofalignment hooks another band, provided that the seer has enough energy.\"Our normal energy allows our assemblage points to use the force of alignment ofone great band of emanations; and we perceive the world we know.\"But if we have a surplus of energy, we can use the force of alignment of othergreat bands, and consequently we perceive other worlds.\"Don Juan abruptly changed the subject and began to talk about plants.\"This may seem like an oddity to you,\" he said, \"but trees, for instance, arecloser to man than ants. I've told you that trees and man can develop a greatrelationship. That is because we share emanations.\"\"How big are their cocoons?\" I asked.\"The cocoon of a giant tree is not much larger than the tree itself. Theinteresting part is that some tiny plants have a cocoon almost as big as a man'sbody and three times its width. Those are power plants. They share the largestamount of emanations with man, not the emanations of awareness, but otheremanations in general.\"Another thing unique about plants is that their luminosities have differentcasts. They are pinkish in general, because their awareness is pink. Poisonousplants are a pale yellow pink and medicinal plants are a bright violet pink. Theonly ones that are white pink are power plants; some are murky white, others arebrilliant white.\"But the real difference between plants and other organic beings is the locationof their assemblage points. Plants have it on the lower part of their cocoon,while other organic beings have it on the upper part of their cocoon.\"\"What about the inorganic beings?\" I asked. \"Where do they have their assemblagepoints?\"\"Some have it on the lower part of their containers,\" he said. \"Those arethoroughly alien to man, but akin to plants. Others have it anywhere on theupper part of their containers. Those are close to man and other organiccreatures.\"He added that the old seers were convinced that plants have the most intensecommunication with inorganic beings. They believed that the lower the assemblagepoint, the easier for plants to break the barrier of perception. Very largetrees and very small plants have their assemblage points extremely low in theircocoon. Because of this, a great number of the old seers' sorcery techniqueswere means to harness the awareness of trees and small plants in order to usethem as guides to descend to what they called the deepest levels of the darkregions.\"You understand, of course,\" don Juan went on, \"that when they thought they weredescending to the depths, they were, in fact, pushing their assemblage points toassemble other perceivable worlds with those seven great bands.\"They taxed their awareness to the limit and assembled worlds with five greatbands that are accessible to seers only if they undergo a dangeroustransformation.\"\"But did the old seers succeed in assembling those worlds?\" I asked.\"They did,\" he said. \"In their aberration they believed it was worth their whileto break all the barriers of perception, even if they had to become trees to dothat.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"11. Stalking, Intent, and the Dreaming PositionThe next day in the early evening, don Juan came to the room where I was talkingwith Genaro. He took me by the arm and walked me through the house to the backpatio. It was already fairly dark. We started to walk around in the corridorthat encircled the patio.As we walked, don Juan told me that he wanted to warn me once again that it isvery easy in the path of knowledge to get lost in intricacies and morbidity. Hesaid that seers are up against great enemies that can destroy their purpose,muddle their aims, and make them weak; enemies created by the warriors' pathitself together with the sense of indolence, laziness, and self-importance thatare integral parts of the daily world.He remarked that the mistakes the ancient seers made as a result of indolence,laziness, and self-importance were so enormous and so grave that the new seershad no option but to scorn and reject their own tradition.\"The most important thing the new seers needed,\" don Juan continued, \"waspractical steps in order to make their assemblage points shift. Since they hadnone, they began by developing a keen interest in seeing the glow of awareness,and as a result they worked out three sets of techniques that became theircornerstone.\"Don Juan said that with these three sets, the new seers accomplished a mostextraordinary and difficult feat. They succeeded in systematically making theassemblage point shift away from its customary position. He acknowledged thatthe old seers had also accomplished that feat, but by means of capricious,idiosyncratic maneuvers.He explained that what the new seers saw in the glow of awareness resulted inthe sequence in which they arranged the old seers' truths about awareness. Thisis known as the mastery of awareness. From that, they developed the three setsof techniques. The first is the mastery of stalking, the second is the masteryof intent, and the third is the mastery of dreaming. He maintained that he hadtaught me these three sets from the very first day we met.He told me that he had taught me the mastery of awareness in two ways just asthe new seers recommend. In his teachings for the right side which he had donein normal awareness, he accomplished two goals: he taught me the warriors' way,and he loosened my assemblage point from its original position. In his teachingsfor the left side which he had done in heightened awareness, he alsoaccomplished two goals: he had made my assemblage point shift to as manypositions as I was capable of sustaining, and he had given me a long series ofexplanations.Don Juan stopped talking and stared at me fixedly. There was an awkward silence.Then he started to talk about stalking.He said that it had very humble and fortuitous origins. It started from anobservation the new seers made when warriors steadily behave in ways notcustomary for them. The unused emanations inside their cocoons begin to glow,and their assemblage points shift in a mild, harmonious, barely noticeablefashion.Stimulated by this observation, the new seers began to practice the systematiccontrol of their behavior. They called this practice the art of stalking. DonJuan remarked that the name, although objectionable, was appropriate, becausestalking entailed a specific kind of behavior with people; behavior that couldbe categorized as surreptitious. [* - (1.)marked by quiet and caution andsecrecy; taking pains to avoid being observed. (2.) conducted with or marked byhidden aims or methods]The new seers, armed with this technique, tackled the known in a sober andfruitful way. By continual practice, they made their assemblage points movesteadily.\"Stalking is one of the two greatest accomplishments of the new seers.\" he said.\"The new seers decided that it should be taught to a modern-day nagual when hisassemblage point has moved quite deep into the left side. The reason for thisdecision is that a nagual must learn the principles of stalking without theencumbrance of the human inventory. After all, the nagual is the leader of agroup, and to lead them he has to act quickly without first having to thinkabout it.\"Other warriors can learn stalking in their normal awareness, although it isadvisable that they do it in heightened awareness- not so much because of thevalue of heightened awareness, but because it imbues stalking with a mysterythat it doesn't really have. Stalking is merely behavior with people.\"He said that I could now understand that shifting the assemblage point was thereason why the new seers placed such a high value on the interaction with pettytyrants. Petty tyrants forced seers to use the principles of stalking, and indoing so, helped seers to move their assemblage points.I asked him if the old seers knew anything at all about the principles ofstalking.\"Stalking belongs exclusively to the new seers,\" he said, smiling. \"They are theonly seers who had to deal with people. The old ones were so wrapped up in theirsense of power that they didn't even know that people existed until peoplestarted clobbering them on the head. But you already know all this.\"Don Juan said next that the mastery of intent together with the mastery ofstalking are the new seers' two masterpieces which mark the arrival of themodern-day seers. He explained that in their efforts to gain an advantage overtheir oppressors, the new seers pursued every possibility.They knew that their predecessors had accomplished extraordinary feats bymanipulating a mysterious and miraculous force which they could only describe aspower. The new seers had very little information about that force, so they wereobliged to examine it systematically through seeing. Their efforts were amplyrewarded when they discovered that the energy of alignment is that force.They began by seeing how the glow of awareness increases in size and intensityas the emanations inside the cocoon are aligned with the emanations at large.They used that observation as a springboard, just as they had done withstalking, and went on to develop a complex series of techniques to handle thatalignment of emanations.At first they referred to those techniques as the mastery of alignment. Thenthey realized that what was involved was much more than just alignment. What wasinvolved was the energy that comes out of the alignment of emanations. Theycalled that energy will.Will became the second basis. The new seers understood it as a blind,impersonal, ceaseless burst of energy that makes us behave in the ways we do.Will accounts for our perception of the world of ordinary affairs. Andindirectly through the force of that perception, it accounts for the placementof the assemblage point in its customary position.Don Juan said that the new seers examined how the perception of the world ofeveryday life takes place and saw the effects of will. They saw that alignmentis ceaselessly renewed in order to imbue perception with continuity. To renewalignment every time with the freshness that it needs to make up a living world,the burst of energy that comes out of those very alignments is automaticallyrerouted to reinforce some choice alignments.This new observation served the new seers as another springboard that helpedthem reach the third basis of the set. They called it intent. They describedintent as the purposeful guiding of the energy of alignment; of will.\"Silvio Manuel, Genaro, and Vicente were pushed by the nagual Julian to learnthose three aspects of the seers' knowledge,\" he went on. \"Genaro is the masterof handling awareness, Vicente is the master of stalking, and Silvio Manuel isthe master of intent.\"We are now doing a final explanation of the mastery of awareness. This is whyGenaro is helping you.\" Don Juan talked to the female apprentices for a long time. The women listenedwith serious expressions on their faces. I felt sure he was giving them detailedinstructions about difficult procedures, judging from the women's fierceconcentration.I had been barred from their meeting, but I had watched them as they talked inthe front room of Genaro's house. I sat at the kitchen table waiting until theywere through.Then the women got up to leave, but before they did, they came to the kitchenwith don Juan. He sat down facing me while the women talked to me with awkwardformality. They actually embraced me. All of them were unusually friendly, eventalkative. They said that they were going to join the male apprentices, who hadgone with Genaro hours earlier. Genaro was going to show all of them hisdreaming body. As soon as the women left, don Juan quite abruptly resumed his explanation. Hesaid that as time passed and the new seers established their practices, theyrealized that under the prevailing conditions of life, stalking only moved theassemblage points minimally.For maximum effect, stalking needed an ideal setting: It needed petty tyrants inpositions of great authority and power. As it became increasingly difficult forthe new seers to place themselves in such situations, the task of improvisingthem or seeking them out became an unbearable burden.The new seers deemed it imperative to see the Eagle's emanations in order tofind a more suitable way to move the assemblage point. As they tried to see theemanations they were faced with a very serious problem.They found out that there is no way to see them without running a mortal risk,and yet they had to see them. That was the time when they used the old seers'technique of dreaming as a shield to protect themselves from the deadly blow ofthe Eagle's emanations. And in doing so, they realized that dreaming was initself the most effective way to move the assemblage point.\"One of the strictest commands of the new seers,\" don Juan continued, \"was thatwarriors have to learn dreaming while they are in their normal state ofawareness. Following that command, I began teaching you dreaming almost from thefirst day we met.\"\"Why do the new seers command that dreaming has to be taught in normalawareness?\" I asked.\"Because dreaming is so dangerous and dreamers so vulnerable,\" he said.\"Dreaming is dangerous because it has inconceivable power, and it makes dreamersvulnerable because it leaves them at the mercy of the incomprehensible force ofalignment.\"The new seers realized that in our normal state of awareness we have countlessdefenses that can safeguard us against the force of unused emanations thatsuddenly become aligned in dreaming.\"Don Juan explained that dreaming, like stalking, began with a simpleobservation. The old seers became aware that in dreams the assemblage pointshifts slightly to the left side in a most natural manner. The point relaxeswhen a person sleeps and all kinds of unused emanations begin to glow.The old seers became immediately intrigued with that observation, and began towork with that natural shift until they were able to control it. They calledthat control dreaming, or the art of handling the dreaming body.He remarked that there is hardly a way of describing the immensity of theirknowledge about dreaming. Very little of it, however, was of any use to the newseers. So when the time of reconstruction came, the new seers took forthemselves only the bare essentials of dreaming to aid them in seeing theEagle's emanations and to help them move their assemblage points.He said that seers, old and new, understand dreaming as being the control of thenatural shift that the assemblage point undergoes in sleep. He stressed that tocontrol that shift does not mean in any way to direct it, but to keep theassemblage point fixed at the position where it naturally moves in sleep; a mostdifficult maneuver that took the old seers enormous effort and concentration toaccomplish.Don Juan explained that dreamers have to strike a very subtle balance, fordreams cannot be interfered with, nor can they be commanded by the consciouseffort of the dreamer; and yet the shift of the assemblage point must obey thedreamer's command. This contradiction cannot be rationalized. It must beresolved in practice.After observing dreamers while they slept, the old seers hit upon the solutionof letting dreams follow their natural course. They had seen that in somedreams, the assemblage point of the dreamer would drift considerably deeper intothe left side than in other dreams. This observation posed to them the questionof whether the content of the dream makes the assemblage point move, or themovement of the assemblage point by itself produces the content of the dream byactivating unused emanations.They soon realized that the shifting of the assemblage point into the left sideis what produces dreams. The farther the movement, the more vivid and bizarrethe dream. Inevitably, they attempted to command their dreams, aiming to maketheir assemblage points move deeply into the left side.Upon trying it, they discovered that when dreams are consciously orsemiconsciously manipulated, the assemblage point immediately returns to itsusual place. Since what they wanted was for that point to move, they reached theunavoidable conclusion that interfering with dreams was interfering with thenatural shift of the assemblage point.Don Juan said that from there the old seers went on to develop their astoundingknowledge on the subject- a knowledge which had a tremendous bearing on what thenew seers aspired to do with dreaming, but was of little use to them in itsoriginal form.He told me that thus far I had understood dreaming as being the control ofdreams, and that every one of the exercises he had given me to perform, such asfinding my hands in my dreams, was not, although it might seem to be, aimed atteaching me to command my dreams.Those exercises were designed to keep my assemblage point fixed at the placewhere it had moved in my sleep. It is here that the dreamers have to strike asubtle balance. All they can direct is the fixation of their assemblage points.Seers are like fishermen equipped with a line that casts itself wherever it may.The only thing they can do is keep the line anchored at the place where itsinks.\"Wherever the assemblage point moves in dreams is called the 'dreamingposition',\" he went on. \"The old seers became so expert at keeping theirdreaming position that they were even able to wake up while their assemblagepoints were anchored there.\"The old seers called that state the dreaming body, because they controlled itto the extreme of creating a temporary new body every time they woke up at a newdreaming position.\"I have to make it clear to you that dreaming has a terrible drawback,\" he wenton. \"It belongs to the old seers. It's tainted with their mood. I've been verycareful in guiding you through it, but still there is no way to make sure.\"\"What are you warning me about, don Juan?\" I asked.\"I'm warning you about the pitfalls of dreaming, which are truly stupendous,\" hereplied. \"In dreaming, there is really no way of directing the movement of theassemblage point. The only thing that dictates that shift is the inner strengthor weakness of dreamers. Right there we have the first pitfall.\"He said that at first the new seers were hesitant to use dreaming. It was theirbelief that dreaming, instead of fortifying them, made warriors weak,compulsive, and capricious. The old seers were all like that. In order to offsetthe nefarious effect of dreaming, since the new seers had no other option but touse it, they developed a complex and rich system of behavior called thewarriors' way, or the warriors' path.With that system, the new seers fortified themselves and acquired the internalstrength they needed to guide the shift of the assemblage point in dreams. DonJuan stressed that the strength that he was talking about was not convictionalone. No one could have had stronger convictions than the old seers, and yetthey were weak to the core.Internal strength meant a sense of equanimity almost of indifference, a feelingof being at ease, but above all it meant a natural and profound bent forexamination, for understanding. The new seers called all these traits ofcharacter sobriety.\"The conviction that the new seers have,\" he continued, \"is that a life ofimpeccability by itself leads unavoidably to a sense of sobriety, and this inturn leads to the movement of the assemblage point.\"I've said that the new seers believed that the assemblage point can be movedfrom within. They went one step further and maintained that impeccableindividuals need no one to guide them. By themselves, through saving theirenergy, they can do everything that seers do. All they need is the minimalchance which they gain from being aware of the possibilities that the seers haveunraveled.\"I told him that we were back in the same position we had been in in my normalstate of awareness. I was still convinced that impeccability or saving energywas something so vague that it could be interpreted by anyone in whateverwhimsical way he wanted.I wanted to say more to build my argument, but a strange feeling overtook me. Itwas an actual physical sensation that I was rushing through something. And thenI rebuffed my own argument.I knew without any doubt whatsoever that don Juan was right. All that isrequired is impeccability and freed energy; and that begins with a single actthat has to be deliberate, precise, and sustained. If that act is repeated longenough, one acquires a sense of unbending intent, which can be applied toanything else. If that is accomplished the road is clear. One thing will lead toanother until the warrior realizes his full potential.When I told don Juan what I had just realized, he laughed with apparent delight,and he exclaimed that this was indeed a godsent example of the strength that hewas talking about. He explained that my assemblage point had shifted, and thatit had been moved by sobriety to a position that fostered understanding. Itcould have as well been moved by capriciousness to a position that only enhancesself-importance, as had been the case many times before.\"Let's talk now about the dreaming body,\" he went on. \"The old seersconcentrated all their efforts on exploring and exploiting the dreaming body.And they succeeded in using it as a more practical body, which is tantamount tosaying they recreated themselves in increasingly weird ways.\"Don Juan maintained that it is common knowledge among the new seers that flocksof the old sorcerers never came back after waking up at a dreaming position oftheir liking. He said that chances are they all died in those inconceivableworlds, or they may still be alive today in who knows what kind of contortedshape or manner.He stopped and looked at me and broke into a great laugh.\"You're dying to ask me what the old seers did with the dreaming body, aren'tyou?\" he asked, and urged me with a movement of his chin to ask the question.Don Juan stated that Genaro, being the indisputable master of awareness, hadshown me the dreaming body many times while I was in a state of normalawareness. The effect that Genaro was after with his demonstrations was to makemy assemblage point move, not from a position of heightened awareness, but fromits normal setting.Don Juan told me then, as if he were letting a secret be known, that Genaro waswaiting for us in some fields near the house to show me his dreaming body. Herepeated over and over that I was now in the perfect state of awareness to seeand understand what the dreaming body really is.Then he had me get up, and we walked through the front room to reach the door tothe outside. As I was about to open the door, I noticed that someone was lyingon the pile of floor mats that the apprentices used as beds. I thought that oneof the apprentices must have returned to the house while don Juan and I weretalking in the kitchen.I went up to him, and then I realized that it was Genaro. He was sound asleep,snoring peacefully, lying face down.\"Wake him up,\" don Juan said to me. \"We've got to be going. He must be deadtired.\"I gently shook Genaro. He slowly turned around, made the sounds of someonewaking up from a deep slumber. He stretched his arms, and then he opened hiseyes. I screamed involuntarily and jumped back.Genaro's eyes were not human eyes at all. They were two points of intense amberlight. The jolt of my fright had been so intense that I became dizzy. Don Juantapped my back and restored my equilibrium.Genaro stood up and smiled at me. His features were rigid. He moved as if hewere drunk or physically impaired. He walked by me and headed directly for thewall. I winced at the imminent crash, but he went through the wall as if it werenot there at all. He came back into the room through the kitchen doorway. Andthen, as I looked in true horror, Genaro walked on the walls, with his bodyparallel to the ground, and on the ceiling, with his head upside down.I fell backwards as I tried to follow his movements. From that position I didn'tsee Genaro anymore. Instead I was looking at a blob of light that moved on theceiling above me and on the walls, circling the room. It was as if someone witha giant flashlight was shining the beam on the ceiling and the walls. The beamof light was finally turned off. It disappeared from view by vanishing against awall.Don Juan remarked that my animal fright was always out of measure, that I had tostruggle to bring it under control, but that all in all, I had behaved verywell. I had seen Genaro's dreaming body as it really is, a blob of light.I asked him how he was so sure I had done that. He replied that he had seen myassemblage point first move toward its normal setting in order to compensate formy fright, then move deeper into the left, beyond the point where there are nodoubts.\"At that position there is only one thing one can see; blobs of energy,\" he wenton. \"But from heightened awareness to that other point deeper into the leftside, it is only a short hop. The real feat is to make the assemblage pointshift from its normal setting to the point of no doubt.\"He added that we still had an appointment with Genaro's dreaming body in thefields around the house, while I was in normal awareness. When we were back in Silvio Manuel's house, don Juan said that Genaro'sproficiency with the dreaming body was a very minor affair compared with whatthe old seers did with it.\"You'll see that very soon,\" he said with an ominous tone, then laughed.I questioned him about it with mounting fear, and that only evoked morelaughter. He finally stopped and said that he was going to talk about the waythe new seers got to the dreaming body and the way they used it.\"The old seers were after a perfect replica of the body,\" he continued, \"andthey nearly succeeded in getting one. The only thing they never could copy wasthe eyes. Instead of eyes, the dreaming body has just the glow of awareness. Younever realized that before when Genaro used to show you his dreaming body.\"The new seers could not care less about a perfect replica of the body. In fact,they are not even interested in copying the body at all. But they have kept justthe name dreaming body to mean a feeling; a surge of energy that is transportedby the movement of the assemblage point to any place in this world, or to anyplace in the seven worlds available to man.\"Don Juan then outlined the procedure for getting to the dreaming body. He saidthat it starts with an initial act which by the fact of being sustained breedsunbending intent. Unbending intent leads to internal silence, and internalsilence to the inner strength needed to make the assemblage point shift indreams to suitable positions.He called this sequence the groundwork. The development of control comes afterthe groundwork has been completed; control consists of systematicallymaintaining the dreaming position by doggedly holding on to the vision of thedream. Steady practice results in a great facility to hold new dreamingpositions with new dreams, not so much because one gains deliberate control withpractice, but because every time this control is exercised the inner strengthgets fortified. Fortified inner strength in turn makes the assemblage pointshift into dreaming positions which are more and more suitable to fosteringsobriety. In other words, dreams by themselves become more and more manageable,even orderly.\"The development of dreamers is indirect,\" he went on. \"That's why the new seersbelieved we can do dreaming by ourselves alone. Since dreaming uses a natural,built-in shift of the assemblage point, we should need no one to help us.\"What we badly need is sobriety, and no one can give it to us or help us get itexcept ourselves. Without it, the shift of the assemblage point is chaotic; justas our ordinary dreams are chaotic.\"So, all in all, the procedure to get to the dreaming body is impeccability inour daily life.\"Don Juan explained that once sobriety is acquired, and the dreaming positionsbecome increasingly stronger, the next step is to wake up at any dreamingposition. He remarked that the maneuver, although made to sound simple, wasreally a very complex affair- so complex that it requires not only sobriety butall the attributes of warriorship as well, especially intent.I asked him how intent helps seers wake up at a dreaming position. He repliedthat intent, being the most sophisticated control of the force of alignment, iswhat maintains, through the dreamer's sobriety, the alignment of whateveremanations have been lit up by the movement of the assemblage point.Don Juan said that there is one more formidable pitfall of dreaming: the verystrength of the dreaming body. For example, it is very easy for the dreamingbody to gaze at the Eagle's emanations uninterruptedly for long periods of time,but it is also very easy in the end for the dreaming body to be totally consumedby them.Seers who gazed at the Eagle's emanations without their dreaming bodies died,and those who gazed at them with their dreaming bodies burned with the fire fromwithin. The new seers solved the problem by seeing in teams. While one seergazed at the emanations, others stood by ready to end the seeing.\"How did the new seers see in teams?\" I asked.\"They dreamed together,\" he replied. \"As you yourself know, it's perfectlypossible for a group of seers to activate the same unused emanations. And inthis case also, there are no known steps, it just happens. There is no techniqueto follow.\"He added that in dreaming together, something in us takes the lead and suddenlywe find ourselves sharing the same view with other dreamers. What happens isthat our human condition makes us focus the glow of awareness automatically onthe same emanations that other human beings are using. We adjust the position ofour assemblage points to fit the others around us. We do that on the right sidein our ordinary perception, and we also do it on the left side, while dreamingtogether. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"12. The Nagual JulianThere was a strange excitement in the house. All the seers of don Juan's partyseemed to be so elated that they were actually absentminded, a thing that I hadnever witnessed before. Their usual high level of energy appeared to haveincreased.I became very apprehensive. I asked don Juan about it. He took me to the backpatio. We walked in silence for a moment. He said that the time was gettingcloser for all of them to leave. He was pressing his explanation in order tofinish it in time.\"How do you know that you are closer to leaving?\" I asked.\"It is an internal knowledge,\" he said. \"You'll know it someday yourself. Yousee, the nagual Julian made my assemblage point shift countless times, just as Ihave made yours shift. Then he left me the task of realigning all thoseemanations which he had helped me align through these shifts. That is the taskthat every nagual is left to do.\"At any rate, the job of realigning all those emanations paves the way for thepeculiar maneuver of lighting up all the emanations inside the cocoon. I havenearly done that. I am about to reach my maximum. Since I am the nagual, once Ido light up all the emanations inside my cocoon we will all be gone in aninstant.\"I felt I should be sad and weep, but something in me was so overjoyed to hearthat the nagual Juan Matus was about to be free that I jumped and yelled withsheer delight. I knew that sooner or later I would reach another state ofawareness and I would weep with sadness. But that day I was filled withhappiness and optimism.I told don Juan how I felt. He laughed and patted my back.\"Remember what I've told you,\" he said. \"Don't count on emotional realizations.Let your assemblage point move first, then years later have the realization.\"We walked to the big room and sat down to talk. Don Juan hesitated for a moment.He looked out of the window. From my chair I could see the patio. It was earlyafternoon; a cloudy day. It looked like rain. Thunderhead clouds were moving infrom the west. I liked cloudy days. Don Juan did not. He seemed restless as hetried to find a more comfortable sitting position.Don Juan began his elucidation by commenting that the difficulty in rememberingwhat takes place in heightened awareness is due to the infinitude of positionsthat the assemblage point can adopt after being loosened from its normalsetting. Facility in remembering everything that takes place in normalawareness, on the other hand, has to do with the fixity of the assemblage pointon one spot, the spot where it normally sets.He told me that he commiserated with me. He suggested that I accept thedifficulty of recollecting and acknowledge that I might fail in my task andnever be able to realign all the emanations that he had helped me align.\"Think of it this way,\" he said, smiling. \"You may never be able to rememberthis very conversation that we are having now, which at this moment seems to youso commonplace; so taken for granted.\"This indeed is the mystery of awareness. Human beings reek of that mystery. Wereek of darkness; of things which are inexplicable. To regard ourselves in anyother terms is madness. So don't demean the mystery of man in you by feelingsorry for yourself or by trying to rationalize it. Demean the stupidity of manin you by understanding it. But don't apologize for either. Both are needed.\"One of the great maneuvers of stalkers is to pit the mystery against thestupidity in each of us.\"He explained that stalking practices are not something one can rejoice in. Infact, they are downright objectionable. Knowing this, the new seers realize thatit would be against everybody's interest to discuss or practice the principlesof stalking in normal awareness.I pointed out to him an incongruity. He had said that there is no way forwarriors to act in the world while they are in heightened awareness, and he hadalso said that stalking is simply behaving with people in specific ways. The twostatements contradicted each other.\"By not teaching it in normal awareness I was referring only to teaching it to anagual,\" he said. \"The purpose of stalking is twofold: first, to move theassemblage point as steadily and safely as possible, and nothing can do the jobas well as stalking; second, to imprint its principles at such a deep level thatthe human inventory is bypassed, as is the natural reaction of refusing andjudging something that may be offensive to reason.\"I told him that I sincerely doubted I could judge or refuse anything like that.He laughed and said that I could not be an exception, that I would react likeeveryone else once I heard about the deeds of a master stalker, such as hisbenefactor, the nagual Julian.\"I am not exaggerating when I tell you that the nagual Julian was the mostextraordinary stalker I have ever met,\" don Juan said. \"You have already heardabout his stalking skills from everybody else. But I've never told you what hedid to me.\"I wanted to make it clear to him that I had not heard anything about the nagualJulian from anyone, but just before I voiced my protest a strange feeling ofuncertainty swept over me. Don Juan seemed to know instantly what I was feeling.He chuckled with delight.\"You can't remember, because will is not available to you yet,\" he said. \"Youneed a life of impeccability and a great surplus of energy, and then will mightrelease those memories.\"I am going to tell you the story of how the nagual Julian behaved with me whenI first met him. If you judge him and find his behavior objectionable while youare in heightened awareness, think of how revolted you might be with him innormal awareness.\"I protested that he was setting me up. He assured me that all he wanted to dowith his story was to illustrate the manner in which stalkers operate and thereasons why they do it.\"The nagual Julian was the last of the old-time stalkers,\" he went on. \"He was astalker not so much because of the circumstances of his life but because thatwas the bent of his character.\"Don Juan explained that the new seers saw that there are two main groups ofhuman beings: those who care about others and those who do not. In between thesetwo extremes they saw an endless mixture of the two. The nagual Julian belongedto the category of men who do not care; don Juan classified himself as belongingto the opposite category.\"But didn't you tell me that the nagual Julian was generous, that he would giveyou the shirt off his back?\" I asked.\"He certainly was,\" don Juan replied. \"Not only was he generous; he was alsoutterly charming and winning. He was always deeply and sincerely interested ineverybody around him. He was kind and open and gave away everything he had toanyone who needed it, or to anyone he happened to like. He was in turn loved byeveryone; because being a master stalker, he conveyed to them his true feelings:He didn't give a plugged nickel for any of them.\"I did not say anything, but don Juan was aware of my sense of disbelief or evendistress at what he was saying. He chuckled and shook his head from side toside.He said, \"That's stalking. You see? I haven't even begun my story of the nagualJulian and you are already annoyed.\"He exploded into a giant laugh as I tried to explain what I was feeling.\"The nagual Julian didn't care about anyone,\" he continued. \"That's why he couldhelp people. And he did. He gave them the shirt off his back, because he didn'tgive a fig about them.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the only ones who help their fellow men are thosewho don't give a damn about them?\" I asked, truly miffed.\"That's what stalkers say,\" he said with a beaming smile. \"The nagual Julian,for instance, was a fabulous curer. He helped thousands and thousands of people,but he never took credit for it. He let people believe that a woman seer of hisparty was the curer.\"Now, if he had been a man who cared for his fellow men, he would've demandedacknowledgment. Those who care for others care for themselves, and demandrecognition where recognition is due.\"Don Juan said that he, since he belonged to the category of those who care fortheir fellow men, had never helped anyone. He felt awkward with generosity. Hecould not even conceive being loved as the nagual Julian was, and he wouldcertainly feel stupid giving anyone the shirt off his back.\"I care so much for my fellow man,\" he continued, \"that I don't do anything forhim. I wouldn't know what to do. And I would always have the nagging sense thatI was imposing my will on him with my gifts.\"Naturally, I have overcome all these feelings with the warriors' way. Anywarrior can be successful with people, as the nagual Julian was, provided hemoves his assemblage point to a position where it is immaterial whether peoplelike him, dislike him, or ignore him. But that's not the same.\"Don Juan said that when he first became aware of the stalkers' principles, as Iwas then doing, he was as distressed as he could be. The nagual Elias, who wasvery much like don Juan, explained to him that stalkers like the nagual Julianare natural leaders of people. They can help people do anything.\"The nagual Elias said,\" don Juan went on, \"that these warriors can help peopleto get cured, or they can help them to get ill. They can help them to findhappiness, or they can help them to find sorrow. I suggested to the nagual Eliasthat instead of saying that these warriors help people, we should say that theyaffect people. He said that they don't just affect people, but that theyactively herd them around.\"Don Juan chuckled and looked at me fixedly. There was a mischievous glint in hiseyes.\"Strange, isn't it?\" he asked. \"The way stalkers arranged what they see aboutpeople?\" Then don Juan started his story about the nagual Julian. He said that the nagualJulian spent many, many years waiting for an apprentice nagual. He stumbled ondon Juan one day while returning home after a short visit with acquaintances ina nearby village. He was, in fact, thinking about an apprentice nagual as hewalked on the road when he heard a loud gunshot and saw people scrambling inevery direction. He ran with them into the bushes by the side of the road andonly came out from his hiding place at the sight of a group of people gatheredaround someone wounded, lying on the ground.The wounded person was, of course, don Juan who had been shot by the tyrannicalforeman. The nagual Julian saw instantly that don Juan was a special man whosecocoon was divided into four sections instead of two. He also realized that donJuan was badly wounded. He knew that he had no time to waste. His wish had beenfulfilled, but he had to work fast before anyone sensed what was going on. Heheld his head and cried, \"They've shot my son!\"He was traveling with one of the female seers of his party; a husky Indian womanwho always officiated publicly as his mean shrewish wife. They were an excellentteam of stalkers. He cued the woman seer, and she also started weeping andwailing for their son who was unconscious and bleeding to death.The nagual Julian begged the onlookers not to call the authorities but rather tohelp him move his son to his house in the city, which was some distance away. Heoffered money to some strong young men if they would carry his wounded, dyingson.The men carried don Juan to the nagual Julian's house. The nagual was verygenerous with them and paid them handsomely. The men were so touched by thegrieving couple who had cried all the way to the house that they refused to takethe money; but the nagual Julian insisted that they take it to give his sonluck.For a few days, don Juan did not know what to think about the kind couple whohad taken him into their home. He said that to him, the nagual Julian appearedas an almost senile old man. He was not an Indian, but was married to a young,irascible, fat Indian wife, who was as physically strong as she wasill-tempered.Judging by the way she treated his wound, and by the quantities of medicinalplants stashed away in the room where they had put him, don Juan thought thatshe was definitely a curer.The woman also dominated the old man and made him tend to don Juan's wound everyday. They had made a bed for don Juan out of a thick floor mat, and the old manhad a terrible time kneeling down to reach him. Don Juan had fought not to laughat the comical sight of the frail old man trying his best to bend his knees. DonJuan said that while the old man washed his wound, he would mumble incessantly.He had a vacant look in his eyes. His hands shook, and his body trembled fromhead to toe.When the old man was down on his knees, he could never get up by himself. Hewould call his wife, yelling in a raspy voice, filled with contained anger. Thewife would come into the room and both of them would get into a horribleargument. Often she would walk out, leaving the old man to get up by himself.Don Juan assured me that he had never felt so sorry for anyone as he felt forthat poor, kind old man. Many times he wanted to rise and help him up, but hecould hardly move himself. Once the old man spent half an hour cursing andyelling, as he puffed and crawled like a slug; dragging himself to the door, andpainfully lifting himself up to a standing position.The old man explained to don Juan that his poor health was due to advanced age,broken bones that had not mended properly, and rheumatism. Don Juan said thatthe old man raised his eyes toward heaven and confessed to don Juan that he wasthe most wretched man on earth. He had come to the curer for help, and had endedup marrying her and becoming a slave.\"I asked the old man why he didn't leave,\" don Juan continued. \"The old man'seyes widened with fear. He choked on his own saliva trying to hush me, and thenhe went rigid and fell down like a log on the floor next to my bed trying tomake me stop talking.\"You don't know what you're saying. You don't know what you're saying. Nobodycan run away from this place,\" the old man kept on repeating with a wildexpression in his eyes.\"I believed him. I was convinced that he was more miserable, more wretched thanI had ever been myself, and with every day that passed, I became more and moreuncomfortable in that house.\"The food was great, and the woman was always out curing people, so I was leftwith the old man. We talked a lot about my life. I liked to talk to him. I toldhim that I had no money to pay him for his kindness, but that I would doanything to help him. He told me that he was beyond help, that he was ready todie, but that if I really meant what I said, he would appreciate it if I wouldmarry his wife after he died.\"Right then I knew the old man was nuts. And right then I also knew that I hadto run away as soon as possible.\"Don Juan said that when he was well enough to walk around unaided, hisbenefactor gave him a chilling demonstration of his ability as a stalker.Without any warning or preamble he put don Juan face to face with an inorganicliving being. Sensing that don Juan was planning to run away, he seized theopportunity to scare him with an ally that was somehow able to look like amonstrous man.\"The sight of that ally nearly drove me insane,\" don Juan continued. \"I couldn'tbelieve my eyes, and yet the monster was right in front of me. And the frail oldman was next to me whimpering and begging the monster to spare his life.\"You see, my benefactor was like the old seers. He could dole out his fear, apiece at a time, and the ally was reacting to it. I didn't know that. All Icould see with my very own eyes was a horrendous creature advancing on us, readyto tear us apart, limb from limb.\"The moment the ally lurched onto us, hissing like a serpent, I passed out cold.When I came to my senses again, the old man told me that he had made a deal withthe creature.\"He explained to don Juan that the man had agreed to let both of them live,provided don Juan enter the man's service. Don Juan apprehensively asked whatwas involved in the service. The old man replied that it would be slavery, butpointed out that don Juan's life had nearly ended a few days back when he hadbeen shot. Had not he and his wife come along to stop the bleeding, don Juanwould surely have died, so there was really very little to bargain with, or tobargain for. The monstrous man knew that and had him over a barrel. The old mantold don Juan to stop vacillating and accept the deal, because if he refused,the monstrous man, who was listening behind the door, would burst in and killthem both on the spot and be done with it.\"I had enough nerve to ask the frail old man, who was shaking like a leaf, howthe man would kill us,\" don Juan went on. \"He said that the monster planned tobreak all the bones in our bodies, starting with our feet, as we screamed inunspeakable agony, and that it would take at least five days for us to die.\"I accepted that man's conditions instantly. The old man, with tears in hiseyes, congratulated me and said that the deal wasn't really that bad. We weregoing to be more prisoners than slaves of the monstrous man, but we would eat atleast twice a day; and since we had life, we could work for our freedo. We couldplot, connive, and fight our way out of that hell.\" Don Juan smiled and then broke into laughter. He had known beforehand how Iwould feel about the nagual Julian.\"I told you you'd be upset,\" he said.\"I really don't understand, don Juan,\" I said. \"What was the point of putting onsuch an elaborate masquerade?\"\"The point is very simple,\" he said, still smiling. \"This is another method ofteaching; a very good one. It requires tremendous imagination and tremendouscontrol on the part of the teacher. My method of teaching is closer to what youconsider teaching. It requires a tremendous amount of words. I go to theextremes of talking. The nagual Julian went to the extremes of stalking.\"Don Juan said that there were two methods of teaching among the seers. He wasfamiliar with both of them. He preferred the one that called for explainingeverything and letting the other person know the course of action beforehand. Itwas a system that fostered freedom, choice, and understanding. His benefactor'smethod, on the other hand, was more coercive and did not allow for choice orunderstanding. Its great advantage was that it forced warriors to live theseers' concepts directly with no intermediary elucidation.Don Juan explained that everything his benefactor did to him was a masterpieceof strategy. Every one of the nagual Julian's words and actions was deliberatelyselected to cause a particular effect. His art was to provide his words andactions with the most suitable context so that they would have the necessaryimpact.\"That's the stalkers' method,\" don Juan went on. \"It fosters not understandingbut total realization. For instance, it took me a lifetime to understand what hehad done to me by making me face the ally- although I realized all that withoutany explanation as I lived that experience.\"I've told you that Genaro, for example, doesn't understand what he does, buthis realization of what he is doing is as keen as it can be. That's because hisassemblage point was moved by the stalkers' method.\"He said that if the assemblage point is forced out of its customary setting bythe method of explaining everything, as in my case, there is always the need forsomeone else not only to help in the actual dislodging of the assemblage point,but in dispensing the explanations of what is going on.But if the assemblage point is moved by the stalkers' method, as in his owncase, or Genaro's, there is only a need for the initial catalytic act that yanksthe point from its location.Don Juan said that when the nagual Julian made him face the monstrous lookingally, his assemblage point moved under the impact of fear. Such an intensefright caused by the confrontation- coupled with his weak physical condition-was ideal for dislodging his assemblage point.In order to offset the injurious effects of fright, its impact had to becushioned, but not minimized. Explaining what was happening would have minimizedfear. What the nagual Julian wanted was to make sure that he could use thatinitial catalytic fright as many times as he needed it, but he also wanted tomake sure that he could cushion its devastating impact.That was the reason for his masquerade. The more elaborate and dramatic hisstories were, the greater their cushioning effect. If he, himself, seemed to bein the same boat with don Juan, the fright would not be as intense as if donJuan were alone.\"With his penchant for drama,\" don Juan went on, \"my benefactor was able to movemy assemblage point enough to imbue me right away with an overpowering feelingfor the two basic qualities of warriors: sustained effort and unbending intent.I knew that in order to be free again someday, I would have to work in anorderly and steady fashion and in cooperation with the frail old man, who in myopinion needed my help as much as I needed his. I knew beyond a shadow of adoubt that that was what I wanted to do more than anything else in life.\" I did not get to talk to don Juan again until two days later. We were in Oaxaca,strolling in the main square, in the early morning. There were children walkingto school, people going to church, a few men sitting on the benches, and taxidrivers waiting for tourists from the main hotel.\"It goes without saying that the most difficult thing in the warriors' path isto make the assemblage point move,\" don Juan said. \"That movement is thecompletion of the warriors' quest. To go on from there is another quest. It isthe seers' quest proper.\"He repeated that in the warriors' way, the shift of the assemblage point iseverything. The old seers absolutely failed to realize this truth. They thoughtthe movement of the point was like a marker that determined their positions on ascale of worth. They never conceived that it was that very position whichdetermined what they perceived.\"The stalkers' method,\" don Juan went on, \"in the hands of a master stalker likethe nagual Julian, accounts for stupendous shifts of the assemblage point. Theseare very solid changes. You see, by buttressing the apprentice, thestalker-teacher gets the apprentice's full cooperation and full participation.To get anybody's full cooperation and full participation is about the mostimportant outcome of the stalkers' method; and the nagual Julian was the best atgetting both of them.\" Don Juan said there was no way for him to describe the turmoil that he had gonethrough as he found out, little by little, about the richness and the complexityof the nagual Julian's personality and life. As long as don Juan faced a scared,frail old man who seemed helpless, he was fairly at ease, comfortable. But oneday, soon after they had made the deal with what don Juan thought of as amonstrous looking man, his comfort was shot to pieces when the nagual Juliangave don Juan another unnerving demonstration of his stalking skills.Although don Juan was quite well by then, the nagual Julian still slept in thesame room with him in order to nurse him. When he woke up that day, he announcedto don Juan that their captor was gone for a couple of days, which meant that hedid not have to act like an old man. He confided to don Juan that he onlypretended to be old in order to fool the monstrous looking man.Without giving don Juan time to think, he jumped up from his mat with incredibleagility. He bent over and dunked his head in a pot of water and kept it therefor a while. When he straightened up, his hair was jet black, the gray hair hadwashed away, and don Juan was looking at a man he had never seen before; a manperhaps in his late thirties. He flexed his muscles, breathed deeply, andstretched every part of his body as if he had been too long inside aconstricting cage.\"When I saw the nagual Julian as a young man, I thought that he was indeed thedevil,\" don Juan went on. \"I closed my eyes and I knew that my end was near. Thenagual Julian laughed until he was crying.\"Don Juan said that the nagual Julian then put him at ease by making him shiftback and forth between the right side and the left side awareness.\"For two days the young man pranced around the house,\" don Juan continued. \"Hetold me stories about his life, and jokes that sent me reeling around the roomwith laughter. But what was even more astounding was the way his wife hadchanged. She was actually thin and beautiful. I thought she was a completelydifferent woman. I raved about how complete her change was and how beautiful shelooked. The young man said that when their captor was away she was actuallyanother woman.\"Don Juan laughed and said that his devilish benefactor was telling the truth.The woman was really another seer of the nagual's party.Don Juan asked the young man why they pretended to be what they were not. Theyoung man looked at don Juan, his eyes filled with tears, and he said that themysteries of the world are indeed unfathomable. He and his young wife had beencaught by inexplicable forces and had to protect themselves with that pretense.The reason why he carried on the way he did- as a feeble old man- was becausetheir captor was always peeking in through cracks in the doors. He begged donJuan to forgive him for having fooled him.Don Juan asked who that monstrous looking man was. With a deep sigh, the youngman confessed that he could not even guess. He told don Juan that although hehimself was an educated man and a famous actor from the theater in Mexico City,he was at a loss for explanations.All he knew was that he had come to be treated for the consumption [*consumption- involving the lungs with progressive wasting of the body] that hehad suffered from for many years. He was near death when his relatives broughthim to meet the curer. She helped him to get well, and he fell madly in lovewith the beautiful young Indian and married her. His plans were to take her tothe capital so they could get rich with her curing ability.Before they started on the trip to Mexico City, she warned him that they had todisguise themselves in order to escape a sorcerer. She explained to him that hermother had also been a curer, and had been taught curing by that master sorcererwho had demanded that she, the daughter, stay with him for life.The young man said that he had refused to ask his wife about that relationship.He only wanted to free her, so he disguised himself as an old man and disguisedher as a fat woman.Their story did not end happily. The horrible man caught them and kept them asprisoners. They did not dare to take off their disguise in front of thatnightmarish man, and in his presence they carried on as if they hated eachother. But in reality, they pined for each other and lived only for the shorttimes when that man was away.Don Juan said that the young man embraced him and told him that the room wheredon Juan was sleeping was the only safe place in the house. The young man askeddon Juan if he would please go out and be on the lockout while he made love tohis wife?\"The house shook with their passion,\" don Juan went on, \"while I sat by the doorfeeling guilty for listening and scared to death that the man would come backany minute. And sure enough, I heard him coming into the house. I banged on thedoor, and when they didn't answer, I walked in. The young woman was asleep nakedand the young man was nowhere in sight. I had never seen a beautiful naked womanin my life. I was still very weak. I heard the monstrous man rattling outside.My embarrassment and my fear were so great that I passed out.\" The story about the nagual Julian's doings annoyed me no end. I told don Juanthat I had failed to understand the value of the nagual Julian's stalkingskills. Don Juan listened to me without making a single comment and let meramble on and on.When we finally sat down on a bench, I was very tired. I did not know what tosay when he asked me why his account of the nagual Julian's method of teachinghad upset me so much.\"I can't shake off the feeling that he was a prankster,\" I finally said.\"Pranksters don't teach anything deliberately with their pranks,\" don Juanretorted. \"The nagual Julian played dramas, magical dramas that required amovement of the assemblage point.\"\"He seems like a very selfish person to me,\" I insisted.\"He seems like that to you because you are judging,\" he replied. \"You are beinga moralist. I went through all that myself. If you feel the way you do onhearing about the nagual Julian, think of the way I must have felt myself livingin his house for years. I judged him, I feared him, and I envied him; in thatorder.\"I also loved him, but my envy was greater than my love. I envied his ease, hismysterious capacity to be young or old at will. I envied his flair and above allhis influence on whoever happened to be around. It would drive me up the wallsto hear him engage people in the most interesting conversation. He always hadsomething to say. I never did, and I always felt incompetent and left out.\"Don Juan's revelations made me feel ill at ease. I wished that he would changethe subject because I did not want to hear that he was like me. In my opinion,he was indeed unequaled. He obviously knew how I felt. He laughed and patted myback.\"What I am trying to do with the story of my envy,\" he went on, \"is to point outto you something of great importance; that the position of the assemblage pointdictates how we behave and how we feel.\"My great flaw at that time was that I could not understand this principle. Iwas raw. I lived through self-importance, just as you do, because that was wheremy assemblage point was lodged. You see, I hadn't learned yet that the way tomove that point is to establish new habits; to will it to move. When it didmove, it was as if I had just discovered that the only way to deal with peerlesswarriors like my benefactor is not to have self-importance; so that one cancelebrate them unbiasedly.\"He said that realizations are of two kinds. One is just pep talk; greatoutbursts of emotion and nothing more. The other is the product of a shift ofthe assemblage point. It is not coupled with an emotional outburst, but withaction. The emotional realizations come years later after warriors havesolidified, by usage, the new position of their assemblage points.\"The nagual Julian tirelessly guided all of us to that kind of shift,\" don Juanwent on. \"He got from all of us total cooperation and total participation in hisbigger than life dramas. For instance, with his drama of the young man and hiswife and their captor he had my undivided attention and concern. To me the storyof the old man who was young was very consistent. I had seen the monstrouslooking man with my very own eyes, which meant that the young man got my undyingaffiliation.\"Don Juan said that the nagual Julian was a magician, a conjurer who could handlethe force of will to a degree that would be incomprehensible to the average man.His dramas included magical characters summoned by the force of intent, like theinorganic being that could adopt a grotesque human form.\"The nagual Julian's power was so impeccable,\" don Juan went on, \"that he couldforce anyone's assemblage point to shift and align emanations that would makehim perceive whatever the nagual Julian wanted. For example, he could look veryold or very young for his age, depending on what he wanted to accomplish. Andall anyone who knew the nagual could say about his age was that it fluctuated.During the thirty-two years that I knew him he was at times not much older thanyou are now, and at other times he was so wretchedly old that he could not evenwalk.\"Don Juan said that under his benefactor's guidance his assemblage point movedunnoticeably and yet profoundly. For instance, out of nowhere one day herealized that he had a fear that on the one hand made no sense to him at all,and on the other made all the sense in the world.\"My fear was that through stupidity I would lose my chance to be free, and Iwould repeat my father's life.\"There was nothing wrong with my father's life, mind you. He lived and died nobetter and no worse than most men. The important point is that my assemblagepoint had moved and I realized one day that my father's life and death hadn'tamounted to a hill of beans, either to others or to himself.\"My benefactor told me that my father and mother had lived and died just to haveme, and that their own parents had done the same for them. He said that warriorswere different in that they shift their assemblage points enough to realize thetremendous price that has been paid for their lives. This shift gives them therespect and awe that their parents never felt for life in general, or for beingalive in particular.\"Don Juan said that not only was the nagual Julian successful in guiding hisapprentices to move their assemblage points, but that he enjoyed himselftremendously while doing it.\"He certainly entertained himself immensely with me,\" don Juan went on. \"Whenthe other seers of my party began to come, years later, even I looked forward tothe preposterous situations that he created and developed with each one of them.\"When the nagual Julian left the world, delight went away with him and nevercame back. Genaro delights us sometimes, but no one can take the nagual Julian'splace. His dramas were always bigger than life. I assure you we didn't know whatenjoyment was until we saw what he did when some of those dramas backfired onhim.\"Don Juan rose from his favorite bench. He turned to me. His eyes were brilliantand peaceful.\"If you are ever so dumb as to fail in your task,\" he said, \"you must have atleast enough energy to move your assemblage point in order to come to thisbench. Sit down here for an instant, free of thoughts and desires. I will try tocome here from wherever I am and collect you. I promise you that I will try.\"He then broke into a great laugh, as if the scope of his promise was tooludicrous to be believed.\"These words should be said in the late afternoon,\" he said, still laughing.\"Never in the morning. The morning makes one feel optimistic and such words losetheir meaning.\" ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"13. The Earth's Boost\"Let's walk on the road to Oaxaca,\" don Juan said to me. \"Genaro is waiting forus somewhere along the way.\"His request took me by surprise. I had been waiting all day for him to continuehis explanation. We left his house and walked in silence through the town to theunpaved highway. We walked leisurely for a long time. Suddenly don Juan began totalk.\"I've been telling you all along about the great findings that the old seersmade,\" he said. \"Just as they found out that organic life is not the only lifepresent on earth, they also discovered that the earth itself is a living being.\"He waited a moment before continuing. He smiled at me as if inviting me to makea comment. I could not think of anything to say.\"The old seers saw that the earth has a cocoon,\" he went on. \"They saw thatthere is a ball encasing the earth, a luminous cocoon that entraps the Eagle'semanations. The earth is a gigantic sentient being subjected to the same forceswe are.\"He explained that the old seers, on discovering this, became immediatelyinterested in the practical uses of that knowledge. The result of their interestwas that the most elaborate categories of their sorcery had to do with theearth. They considered the earth to be the ultimate source of everything we are.Don Juan reaffirmed that the old seers were not mistaken in this respect,because the earth is indeed our ultimate source.He didn't say anything else until we met Genaro about a mile up the road. He waswaiting for us, sitting on a rock by the side of the road.He greeted me with great warmth. He said to me that we should climb up to thetop of some small rugged mountains covered with hardy vegetation.\"The three of us are going to sit against a rock,\" don Juan said to me, \"andlook at the sunlight as it is reflected on the eastern mountains. When the sungoes down behind the western peaks, the earth may let you see alignment.\"When we reached the top of a mountain, we sat down, as don Juan had said, withour backs against a rock. Don Juan made me sit in between the two of them.I asked him what he was planning to do. His cryptic statements and his longsilences were ominous. I felt terribly apprehensive.He didn't answer me. He kept on talking as if I had not spoken at all.\"It was the old seers who, on discovering that perception is alignment,\" hesaid, \"stumbled onto something monumental. The sad part is that theiraberrations again kept them from knowing what they had accomplished.\"He pointed at the mountain range east of the small valley where the town islocated.\"There is enough glitter in those mountains to jolt your assemblage point,\" hesaid to me. \"Just before the sun goes down behind the western peaks, you willhave a few moments to catch all the glitter you need. The magic key that opensthe earth's doors is made of internal silence plus anything that shines.\"\"What exactly should I do, don Juan?\" I asked.Both of them examined me. I thought I saw in their eyes a mixture of curiosityand revulsion.\"Just cut off the internal dialogue,\" don Juan said to me.I had an intense pang of anxiety and doubt. I had no confidence that I could doit at will. After an initial moment of nagging frustration, I resigned my selfjust to relax.I looked around. I noticed that we were high enough to look down into the long,narrow valley. More than half of it was in the late afternoon shadows. The sunwas still shining on the foothills of the eastern range of mountains, on theother side of the valley. The sunlight made the eroded mountains look ocher,while the more distant bluish peaks had acquired a purple tone.\"You do realize that you've done this before, don't you?\" don Juan said to me ina whisper.I told him that I had not realized anything.\"We've sat here before on other occasions,\" he insisted, \"but that doesn'tmatter because this occasion is the one that will count.\"Today with the help of Genaro you are going to find the key that unlockseverything. You won't be able to use it as yet, but you'll know what it is andwhere it is. Seers pay the heaviest prices to know that. You, yourself, havebeen paying your dues all these years.\"He explained that what he called the key to everything was the firsthandknowledge that the earth is a sentient being and as such can give warriors atremendous boost. It is an impulse that comes from the awareness of the earthitself at the instant in which the emanations inside warriors' cocoons arealigned with the appropriate emanations inside the earth's cocoon.Since both the earth and man are sentient beings, their emanations coincide, orrather, the earth has all the emanations present in man and all the emanationsthat are present in all sentient beings, organic and inorganic for that matter.When a moment of alignment takes place, sentient beings use that alignment in alimited way and perceive their world. Warriors can use that alignment either toperceive, like everyone else, or as a boost that allows them to enterunimaginable worlds.\"I've been waiting for you to ask me the only meaningful question you can ask,but you never ask it,\" he continued. \"You are hooked on asking about whether themystery of it all is inside us. You came close enough, though.\"The unknown is not really inside the cocoon of man in the emanations untouchedby awareness, and yet it is there, in a manner of speaking. This is the pointyou haven't understood.\"When I told you that we can assemble seven worlds besides the one we know, youtook it as being an internal affair because your total bias is to believe thatyou are only imagining everything you do with us. Therefore, you have neverasked me where the unknown really is. For years I have circled with my hand topoint to everything around us and I have told you that the unknown is there. Younever made the connection.\"Genaro began to laugh. Then he coughed and stood up. \"He still hasn't made theconnection,\" he said to don Juan.I admitted to them that if there was a connection to be made, I had failed tomake it.Don Juan restated over and over that the portion of emanations inside man'scocoon is in there only for awareness, and that awareness is matching thatportion of emanations with the same portion of emanations at large.They are called emanations at large because they are immense. To say thatoutside man's cocoon is the unknowable, is to say that within the earth's cocoonis the unknowable.However, inside the earth's cocoon is also the unknown. Inside man's cocoon theunknown is the emanations untouched by awareness.When the glow of awareness touches these emanations inside us, they becomeactive and can be aligned with the corresponding emanations at large. Once thathappens the unknown is perceived and becomes the known.\"I'm too dumb, don Juan. You have to break it into smaller pieces for me,\" Isaid.\"Genaro is going to break it up for you,\" don Juan retorted.Genaro stood up and started doing the same gait of power that he had done beforewhen he had circled an enormous flat rock in a corn field by his house. Don Juanhad watched in fascination.This time don Juan whispered in my ear that I should try to hear Genaro'smovements, especially the movements of his thighs as they went up against hischest every time he stepped.I followed Genaro's movements with my eyes. In a few seconds I felt that somepart of me had gotten trapped in Genaro's legs. The movement of his thighs wouldnot let me go. I felt as if I were walking with him. I was even out of breath.Then I realized that I was actually following Genaro. I was in fact walking withhim away from the place where we had been sitting.I did not see don Juan; just Genaro walking ahead of me in the same strangemanner. We walked for hours and hours. My fatigue was so intense that I got aterrible headache, and suddenly I got sick. Genaro stopped walking and came tomy side. There was an intense glare around us, and the light was reflected inGenaro's features. His eyes glowed.\"Don't look at Genaro!\" a voice ordered me in my ear. \"Look around!\"I obeyed. I thought I was in hell! The shock of seeing the surroundings was sogreat that I screamed in terror, but there was no sound to my voice. Around mewas the most vivid picture of all the descriptions of hell from my Catholicupbringing.I was seeing a reddish world; hot and oppressive; dark and cavernous with nosky; and no light except the malignant reflections of reddish lights that kepton moving around us at great speed.Genaro started to walk again, and something pulled me with him. The force thatwas making me follow Genaro also kept me from looking around. My awareness wasglued to Genaro's movements.I saw Genaro plop down as if he were utterly exhausted. The instant he touchedthe ground and stretched himself to rest, something was released in me and I wasable again to look around. Don Juan was watching me inquisitively. I wasstanding up facing him.We were at the same place where we had sat down; a wide rocky ledge on top of asmall mountain. Genaro was panting and wheezing, and so was I.I was covered with perspiration. My hair was dripping wet. My clothes weresoaked, as if I had been dunked in a river.\"My God, what's going on!\" I exclaimed in utter seriousness and concern. Theexclamation sounded so silly that don Juan and Genaro started to laugh.\"We're trying to make you understand alignment,\" Genaro said.Don Juan gently helped me to sit down. He sat by me. \"Do you remember whathappened?\" he asked me.I told him that I did and he insisted that I tell him exactly what I had seen.His request was incongruous with what he had told me, that the only value of myexperiences was the movement of my assemblage point and not the content of myvisions.He explained that Genaro had tried to help me before in very much the samefashion as he had just done, but that I could never remember anything. He saidthat Genaro had guided my assemblage point this time, as he had done before, toassemble a world with another of the great bands of emanations.There was a long silence. I was numb and shocked, yet my awareness was as keenas it had ever been. I thought I had finally understood what alignment was.Something inside me, which I had been activating without knowing how, gave methe certainty that I had comprehended a great truth.\"I think you're beginning to gather your own momentum,\" don Juan said to me.\"Let's go home. You've had enough for one day.\"\"Oh, come on,\" Genaro said. \"He's stronger than a bull. He's got to be pushed alittle further.\"\"No!\" don Juan said emphatically. \"We've got to save his strength. He's only gotso much of it.\"Genaro insisted that we stay. He looked at me and winked.\"Look,\" he said to me, pointing to the eastern range of mountains. \"The sun hashardly moved an inch over those mountains and yet you plodded in hell for hoursand hours. Don't you find that overwhelming?\"\"Don't scare him unnecessarily!\" don Juan protested almost vehemently.It was then that I saw their maneuvers. At that moment the voice of seeing toldme that don Juan and Genaro were a team of superb stalkers playing with me.It was don Juan who always pushed me beyond my limits, but he always let Genarobe the heavy.The day at Genaro's house when I had reached a dangerous state of hystericalfright, Genaro had questioned don Juan whether I should be pushed. Although donJuan had assured me that Genaro was enjoying himself at my expense, Genaro wasactually worrying about me.My seeing was so shocking to me that I began to laugh. Both don Juan and Genarolooked at me with surprise. Then don Juan seemed to realize at once what wasgoing through my mind. He told Genaro, and both of them laughed like children.\"You're coming of age,\" don Juan said to me. \"Right on time. You're neither toostupid nor too bright. Just like me. You're not like me in your aberrations.There you are more like the nagual Julian, except that he was brilliant.\"He stood up and stretched his back. He looked at me with the most piercing,ferocious eyes I had ever seen. I stood up.\"A nagual never lets anyone know that he is in charge,\" he said to me. \"A nagualcomes and goes without leaving a trace. That freedom is what makes him anagual.\"His eyes glared for an instant. Then they were covered by a cloud of mellowness,kindness, and humanness: They were again don Juan's eyes.I could hardly keep my balance. I was swooning helplessly. Genaro jumped to myside and helped me to sit down. Both of them sat down flanking me.\"You are going to catch a boost from the earth,\" don Juan said to me in one ear.\"Think about the nagual's eyes,\" Genaro said to me in the other.\"The boost will come at the moment you see the glitter on the top of thatmountain,\" don Juan said and pointed to the highest peak on the eastern range.\"You'll never see the nagual's eyes again,\" Genaro whispered.\"Go with the boost wherever it takes you,\" don Juan said.\"If you think of the nagual's eyes, you'll realize that there are two sides to acoin,\" Genaro whispered.I wanted to think about what both of them were saying, but my thoughts did notobey me. Something was pressing down on me. I felt I was shrinking. I had asensation of nausea. I saw the evening shadows advancing rapidly up the sides ofthose eastern mountains. I had the feeling that I was running after them.\"Here we go,\" Genaro said in my ear.\"Watch the big peak, watch the glitter,\" don Juan said in my other ear.There was indeed a point of intense brilliance where don Juan had pointed, onthe highest peak of the range. I watched the last ray of sunlight beingreflected on it. I felt a hole in the pit of my stomach, just as if I were on aroller coaster.I felt, rather than heard, a faraway earthquake rumble which abruptly overtookme. The seismic waves were so loud and so enormous that they lost all meaningfor me. I was an insignificant microbe being twisted and twirled.The motion slowed down by degrees. There was one more jolt before everythingcame to a halt. I tried to look around. I had no point of reference. I seemed tobe planted, like a tree.Above me there was a white, shiny, inconceivably big dome. Its presence made mefeel elated. I flew toward it, or rather I was ejected like a projectile. I hadthe sensation of being comfortable, nurtured, secure. The closer I got to thedome, the more intense those feelings became. They finally overwhelmed me and Ilost all sense of myself.The next thing I knew, I was rocking slowly in the air like a leaf that falls. Ifelt exhausted. A suction force started to pull me. I went through a dark holeand then I was with don Juan and Genaro. The next day don Juan, Genaro, and I went to Oaxaca. While don Juan and Istrolled around the main square in the later afternoon, he suddenly started totalk about what we had done the day before. He asked me if I had understood whathe was referring to when he said that the old seers had stumbled onto somethingmonumental.I told him that I did, but that I couldn't explain it in words.\"And what do you think was the main thing we wanted you to find out on top ofthat mountain?\" he asked.\"Alignment,\" a voice said in my ear, at the same time I said it myself.I turned around in a reflex action and bumped into Genaro, who was just behindme, walking in my tracks. The speed of my movement startled him. He broke into agiggle and then embraced me.We sat down. Don Juan said that there were very few things that he could sayabout the boost I had gotten from the earth; that warriors are always alone insuch cases; and true realizations come much later, after years of struggle.I told don Juan that my problem in understanding was magnified by the fact thathe and Genaro were doing all the work. I was simply a passive subject who couldonly react to their maneuvers. I could not for the life of me initiate anyaction, because I did not know what a proper action should be, nor did I knowhow to initiate it.\"That's precisely the point,\" don Juan said. \"You are not supposed to know yet.You are going to be left behind, by yourself, to reorganize on your owneverything we are doing to you now. This is the task every nagual has to face.\"The nagual Julian did the same thing to me much more ruthlessly than the way wedo it to you. He knew what he was doing.\"He was a brilliant nagual who himself was able to reorganize in a few yearseverything the nagual Elias had taught him. In no time at all, he did somethingthat would take a lifetime for you or for me. The difference was that all thenagual Julian ever needed was a slight insinuation. His awareness would take itfrom there and open the only door there is.\"\"What do you mean, don Juan, by the only door there is?\"\"I mean that when man's assemblage point moves beyond a crucial limit, theresults are always the same for every man. The techniques to make it move may beas different as they can be, but the results are always the same- meaning thatthe assemblage point assembles other worlds aided by the boost from the earth.\"\"Is the boost from the earth the same for every man, don Juan?\"\"Of course. The difficulty for the average man is the internal dialogue. Onlywhen a state of total silence is attained can one use the boost. You willcorroborate that truth the day you try to use that boost by yourself.\"\"I wouldn't recommend that you try it,\" Genaro said sincerely. \"It takes yearsto become an impeccable warrior. In order to withstand the impact of the earth'sboost, you must be better than you are now.\"\"The speed of that boost will dissolve everything about you,\" don Juan said.\"Under its impact we become nothing. Speed and the sense of individual existencedon't go together.\"Yesterday on the mountain, Genaro and I supported you and served as youranchors; otherwise you wouldn't have returned. You'd be like some men whopurposely used that boost and went into the unknown and are still roaming insome incomprehensible immensity.\"I wanted him to elaborate on that, but he refused. He changed the subjectabruptly.\"There's one thing you haven't understood yet about the earth's being a sentientbeing,\" he said. \"And Genaro, this awful Genaro, wants to push you until youunderstand.\"Both of them laughed. Genaro playfully shoved me and winked at me as he mouthedthe words, \"I am awful.\"\"Genaro\", don Juan continued, \"is a terrible taskmaster; mean and ruthless. Hedoesn't give a hoot about your fears, and pushes you mercilessly. If it wasn'tfor me...\"Don Juan was a perfect picture of a good, thoughtful old gentleman. He loweredhis eyes and sighed. The two of them broke into roaring laughter.When they had quieted down, don Juan said that Genaro wanted to show me what Ihad not understood yet; that the supreme awareness of the earth is what makes itpossible for us to change into other great bands of emanations.\"We living beings are perceivers,\" he said. \"And we perceive because someemanations inside man's cocoon become aligned with some emanations outside.Alignment, therefore, is the secret passageway, and the earth's boost is thekey.\"Genaro wants you to watch the moment of alignment. Watch him!\"Genaro stood up like a showman and took a bow, then showed us that he hadnothing up his sleeves or inside the legs of his pants. He took his shoes offand shook them to show that there was nothing concealed there either.Don Juan was laughing with total abandon. Genaro moved his hands up and down.The movement created an immediate fixation in me. I sensed that the three of ussuddenly got up and walked away from the square with the two of them flankingme.As we continued walking, I lost my peripheral vision. I did not distinguish anymore houses or streets. I did not notice any mountains or any vegetation either.At one moment I realized that I had lost sight of don Juan and Genaro. Instead Isaw two luminous bundles moving up and down beside me.I felt an instantaneous panic which I immediately controlled. I had the unusualbut well-known sensation that I was myself and yet I was not. I was aware,however, of everything around me by means of a strange and at the same time mostfamiliar capacity.The sight of the world came to me all at once. All of me saw. The entirety ofwhat I in my normal consciousness call my body was capable of sensing as if itwere an enormous eye that detected everything.What I first detected, after seeing the two blobs of light, was a sharpviolet-purple world made out of something that looked like colored panels andcanopies. Flat, screenlike panels of irregular concentric circles wereeverywhere.I felt a great pressure all over me, and then I heard a voice in my ear. I wasseeing. The voice said that the pressure was due to the act of moving. I wasmoving together with don Juan and Genaro.I felt a faint jolt, as if I had broken a paper barrier, and I found myselffacing a luminescent world. Light radiated from everyplace, but without beingglaring. It was as if the sun were about to erupt from behind some whitediaphanous clouds. I was looking down into the source of light. It was abeautiful sight. There were no landmasses, just fluffy white clouds and light.And we were walking on the clouds.Then something imprisoned me again. I moved at the same pace as the two blobs oflight by my sides. Gradually they began to lose their brilliance, then theybecame opaque, and finally they were don Juan and Genaro. We were walking on adeserted side street away from the main square. Then we turned back.\"Genaro just helped you to align your emanations with those emanations at largethat belong to another band,\" don Juan said to me. \"Alignment has to be a verypeaceful, unnoticeable act. No flying away, no great fuss.\"He said that the sobriety needed to let the assemblage point assemble otherworlds is something that cannot be improvised. Sobriety has to mature and becomea force in itself before warriors can break the barrier of perception withimpunity.We were coming closer to the main square. Genaro had not said a word. He walkedin silence as if absorbed in thought. Just before we came into the square, donJuan said that Genaro wanted to show me one more thing; that the position of theassemblage point is everything, and that the world it makes us perceive is soreal that it does not leave room for anything except realness.\"Genaro will let his assemblage point assemble another world just for yourbenefit,\" don Juan said to me. \"And then you'll realize that as he perceives it,the force of his perception will leave room for nothing else.\"Genaro walked ahead of us, and don Juan ordered me to roll my eyes in acounterclockwise direction while I looked at Genaro to avoid being dragged withhim. I obeyed him. Genaro was five or six feet away from me. Suddenly his shapebecame diffuse and in one instant he was gone like a puff of air.I thought of the science fiction movies I had seen and wondered whether we aresubliminally aware of our possibilities.\"Genaro is separated from us at this moment by the force of perception,\" donJuan said quietly. \"When the assemblage point assembles a world, that world istotal. This is the marvel that the old seers stumbled upon yet never realizedwhat it was. The awareness of the earth can give us a boost to align other greatbands of emanations, and the force of that new alignment makes the world vanish.\"Every time the old seers made a new alignment they believed they had descendedto the depths or had ascended to the heavens above. They never knew that theworld disappears like a puff of air when a new total alignment makes us perceiveanother total world.\" ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"14. The Rolling ForceDon Juan was about to start his explanation of the mastery of awareness, but hechanged his mind and stood up. We had been sitting in the big room observing amoment of quiet.\"I want you to try seeing the Eagle's emanations,\" he said. \"For that you mustfirst move your assemblage point until you see the cocoon of man.\"We walked from the house to the center of town. We sat down on an empty, wornpark bench in front of the church, it was early afternoon on a sunny, windy daywith lots of people milling around.He repeated, as if he were trying to drill it into me, that alignment is aunique force because it either helps the assemblage point shift, or it keeps itglued to its customary position. The aspect of alignment that keeps the pointstationary, he said, is will; and the aspect that makes it shift is intent. Heremarked that one of the most haunting mysteries is how will, the impersonalforce of alignment, changes into intent, the personalized force which is at theservice of each individual.\"The strangest part of this mystery is that the change is so easy toaccomplish,\" he went on. \"But what is not so easy is to convince ourselves thatit is possible. There, right there, is our safety catch. We have to beconvinced. And none of us wants to be.\"He told me then that I was in my keenest state of awareness, and that it waspossible for me to intend my assemblage point to shift deeper into my left sideto a dreaming position. He said that warriors should never attempt seeing unlessthey are aided by dreaming.I argued that to fall asleep in public was not one of my fortes. He clarifiedhis statement saying that to move the assemblage point away from its naturalsetting, and to keep it fixed at a new location is to be asleep. With practice,seers learn to be asleep and yet behave as if nothing is happening to them.After a moment's pause he added that for purposes of seeing the cocoon of man,one has to gaze at people from behind as they walk away. It is useless to gazeat people face to face because the front of the egglike cocoon of man has aprotective shield which seers call the front plate. It is an almost impregnable,unyielding shield that protects us throughout our lives against the onslaught ofa peculiar force that stems from the emanations themselves.He also told me not to be surprised if my body was stiff, as though it werefrozen. He said that I was going to feel very much like someone standing in themiddle of a room looking at the street through a window, and that speed was ofthe essence, as people were going to move extremely fast by my seeing window.He told me then to relax my muscles, shut off my internal dialogue, and let myassemblage point drift away under the spell of inner silence. He urged me tosmack myself gently but firmly on my right side, between my hipbone and myribcage.I did that three times and I was sound asleep. It was a most peculiar state ofsleep. My body was dormant, but I was perfectly aware of everything that wastaking place. I could hear don Juan talking to me and I could follow every oneof his statements as if I were awake, yet I could not move my body at all.Don Juan said that a man was going to walk by my seeing window and that I shouldtry to see him. I unsuccessfully attempted to move my head and then a shinyegglike shape appeared, it was resplendent. I was awed by the sight and before Icould recover from my surprise, it was gone. It floated away, bobbing up anddown.Everything had been so sudden and fast that it made me feel frustrated andimpatient. I felt that I was beginning to wake up. Don Juan talked to me againand urged me to relax. He said that I had no right and no time to be impatient.Suddenly, another luminous being appeared and moved away. It seemed to be madeof a white fluorescent shag.Don Juan whispered in my ear that if I wanted to, my eyes were capable ofslowing down everything they focused on. Then he warned me that another man wascoming.I realized at that instant that there were two voices. The one I had just heardwas the same one that had admonished me to be patient. That was don Juan's. Theother, the one that told me to use my eyes to slow down movement, was the voiceof seeing.That afternoon, I saw ten luminous beings in slow motion. The voice of seeingguided me to witness in them everything don Juan had told me about the glow ofawareness.There was a vertical band with a stronger amber glow on the right side of thoseegglike luminous creatures, perhaps one-tenth of the total volume of the cocoon.The voice said that that was man's band of awareness. The voice pointed out adot on man's band, a dot with an intense shine. It was high on the oblong shapesalmost on the crest of them on the surface of the cocoon. The voice said that itwas the assemblage point.When I saw each luminous creature in profile, from the point of view of itsbody, its egglike shape was like a gigantic asymmetrical yoyo that was standingedgewise, or like an almost round pot that was resting on its side with its lidon. The part that looked like a lid was the front plate. It was perhapsone-fifth the thickness of the total cocoon.I would have gone on seeing those creatures, but don Juan said that I should nowgaze at people face to face, and sustain my gaze until I had broken the barrierand I was seeing the emanations.I followed his command. Almost instantaneously, I saw a most brilliant array oflive, compelling fibers of light. It was a dazzling sight that immediatelyshattered my balance.I fell down on the cement walk on my side. From there, I saw the compellingfibers of light multiply themselves. They burst open and myriads of other fiberscame out of them. But the fibers, compelling as they were, somehow did notinterfere with my ordinary view.There were scores of people going into church. I was no longer seeing them.There were quite a few women and men just around the bench. I wanted to focus myeyes on them, but instead I noticed how one of those fibers of light bulgedsuddenly. It became like a ball of fire that was perhaps seven feet in diameter,it rolled on me. My first impulse was to roll out of its way. Before I couldeven move a muscle the ball had hit me.I felt it as clearly as if someone had punched me gently in the stomach. Aninstant later another ball of fire hit me, this time with considerably morestrength, and then don Juan whacked me really hard on the cheek with his openhand. I jumped up involuntarily and lost sight of the fibers of light and theballoons that were hitting me.Don Juan said that I had successfully endured my first brief encounter with theEagle's emanations, but that a couple of shoves from the tumbler had dangerouslyopened up my gap. He added that the balls that had hit me were called therolling force, or the tumbler. We had returned to his house, although I did not remember how or when. I hadspent hours in a sort of semi-sleeping state. Don Juan and the other seers ofhis group had given me large amounts of water to drink. They had also submergedme in an ice-cold tub of water for short periods of time.\"Were those fibers I saw the Eagle's emanations?\" I asked don Juan.\"Yes. But you didn't really see them,\" he replied. \"No sooner had you begun tosee than the tumbler stopped you. If you had remained a moment longer it wouldhave blasted you.\"\"What exactly is the tumbler?\" I asked.\"It is a force from the Eagle's emanations,\" he said. \"A ceaseless force thatstrikes us every instant of our lives. It is lethal when seen. We are obliviousto it in our ordinary lives because we have protective shields. We haveconsuming interests that engage all our awareness. We are permanently worriedabout our station; our possessions.\"These shields, however, do not keep the tumbler away, they simply keep us fromseeing it directly, protecting us in this way from getting hurt by the fright ofseeing the balls of fire hitting us. Shields are a great help and a greathindrance to us. They pacify us and at the same time fool us. They give us afalse sense of security.\"He warned me that a moment would come in my life when I would be without anyshields and uninterruptedly at the mercy of the tumbler. He said that it is anobligatory stage in the life of a warrior known as losing the human form.I asked him to explain to me once and for all what the human form is and what itmeans to lose it.He replied that seers describe the human form as the compelling force ofalignment of the emanations lit by the glow of awareness on the precise spot onwhich normally man's assemblage point is fixated. It is the force that makes usinto persons. Thus, to be a person is to be compelled to affiliate with thatforce of alignment and consequently to be affiliated with the precise spot whereit originates.By reason of their activities, at a given moment the assemblage points ofwarriors drift toward the left. It is a permanent move which results in anuncommon sense of aloofness, or control, or even abandon.That drift of the assemblage point entails a new alignment of emanations. It isthe beginning of a series of greater shifts. Seers very aptly called thisinitial shift losing the human form because it marks an inexorable movement ofthe assemblage point away from its original setting and results in theirreversible loss of our affiliation to the force that makes us normal persons.He asked me then to describe all the details I could remember about the balls offire. I told him that I had seen them so briefly I was not sure I could describethem in detail.He pointed out that seeing is an euphemism for moving the assemblage point, andthat if I moved mine a fraction more to the left I would have a clear picture ofthe balls of fire; a picture which I could interpret then as having rememberedthem.I tried to have a clear picture, but I couldn't, so I described what Iremembered.He listened attentively and then urged me to recall if they were balls orcircles of fire. I told him I didn't remember.He explained that those balls of fire, which the new seers call the rollingforce, are of crucial importance to human beings because they are the expressionof a force that pertains to all details of life and death.I asked him to clarify what he meant by all the details of life and death.\"The rolling force is the means through which the Eagle distributes life andawareness for safekeeping,\" he said. \"But it also is the force that, let's say,collects the rent. It makes all living beings die. What you saw today was calledthe tumbler by the ancient seers.\"He said that seers describe it as an eternal line of iridescent rings, or ballsof fire, that roll onto living beings ceaselessly. Luminous organic beings meetthe rolling force head on until the day when the force proves to be too much forthem and the creatures finally collapse. The old seers were mesmerized by seeinghow the tumbler then tumbles them into the beak of the Eagle to be devoured.That was the reason they called it the tumbler.\"You said that it is a mesmerizing sight. Have you yourself seen it rollinghuman beings?\" I asked.\"Certainly I've seen it,\" he replied, and after a pause he added, \"You and I sawit only a short while ago in Mexico City.\"His assertion was so farfetched that I felt obliged to tell him that this timehe was wrong. He laughed and reminded me that on that occasion, while both of uswere sitting on a bench in the Alameda Park in Mexico City, we had witnessed thedeath of a man. He said that I had recorded the event in my everyday life memoryas well as in my left side emanations.As don Juan spoke to me I had the sensation of something inside me becominglucid by degrees, and I could visualize with uncanny clarity the whole scene inthe park.The man was lying on the grass with three policemen standing by him to keeponlookers away. I distinctly remembered don Juan hitting me on my back to makeme change levels of awareness. And then I saw.My seeing was imperfect. I was unable to shake off the sight of the world ofeveryday life. What I ended up with was a composite of filaments of the mostgorgeous colors superimposed on the buildings and the traffic. The filamentswere actually lines of colored light that came from above. They had inner life.They were bright and bursting with energy.When I had looked at the dying man, I saw what don Juan was talking about.Something that was like circles of fire, or iridescent tumbleweeds, was rollingeverywhere I focused my eyes. The circles were rolling on people; on don Juan;on me. I felt them in my stomach and became ill.Don Juan told me to focus my eyes on the dying man. I saw the man at one momentcurling up, just as a sow bug curls itself up upon being touched. Theincandescent circles pushed him away as if they were casting him aside; out oftheir majestic, inalterable path.I had not liked the feeling. The circles of fire had not scared me. They werenot awesome, or sinister. I did not feel morbid or somber. The circles ratherhad nauseated me. I'd felt them in the pit of my stomach. It was revulsion thatI'd felt that day.Remembering them conjured up again the total feeling of discomfort I hadexperienced on that occasion. As I got ill, don Juan laughed until he was out ofbreath.\"You're such an exaggerated fellow.\" he said. \"The rolling force is not thatbad. It's lovely in fact. The new seers recommend that we open ourselves to it.The old seers also opened themselves to it, but for reasons and purposes guidedmostly by self-importance and obsession.\"The new seers, on the other hand, make friends with it. They become familiarwith that force by handling it without any self-importance. The result isstaggering in its consequences.\"He said that a shift of the assemblage point is all that is needed to openoneself to the rolling force. He added that if the force is seen in a deliberatemanner, there is minimal danger.A situation that is extremely dangerous, however, is an involuntary shift of theassemblage point owing, perhaps, to physical fatigue, emotional exhaustion,disease, or simply a minor emotional or physical crisis; such as beingfrightened or being drunk.\"When the assemblage point shifts involuntarily, the rolling force cracks thecocoon,\" he went on. \"I've talked many times about a gap that man has below hisnavel. It's not really below the navel itself, but in the cocoon at the heightof the navel. The gap is more like a dent; a natural flaw in the otherwisesmooth cocoon. That is where the tumbler hits us ceaselessly and where thecocoon cracks.\"He went on to explain that if it is a minor shift of the assemblage point, thecrack is very small. The cocoon quickly repairs itself, and people experiencewhat everybody has at one time or another; blotches of color and contortedshapes which remain even if the eyes are closed.If the shift is considerable, the crack also is extensive, and it takes time forthe cocoon to repair itself; as in the case of warriors who purposely use powerplants to elicit that shift, or people who take drugs and unwittingly do thesame.In these cases men feel numb and cold. They have difficulty talking or eventhinking. It is as if they have been frozen from inside.Don Juan said that in cases in which the assemblage point shifts drasticallybecause of the effects of trauma or of a mortal disease, the rolling forceproduces a crack the length of the cocoon. The cocoon collapses and curls in onitself, and the individual dies.\"Can a voluntary shift also produce a gap of that nature?\" I asked.\"Sometimes,\" he replied. \"We're really frail. As the tumbler hits us over andover, death comes to us through the gap. Death is the rolling force. When itfinds weakness in the gap of a luminous being, it automatically cracks it openand makes it collapse.\"\"Does every living being have a gap?\" I asked.\"Of course,\" he replied. \"If it didn't have one it wouldn't die. The gaps,however, are different in size and configuration. Man's gap is a bowl-likedepression the size of a fist; a very frail vulnerable configuration. The gapsof other organic creatures are very much like man's; some are stronger than oursand others are weaker.\"But the gap of inorganic beings is really different. It's more like a longthread, a hair of luminosity. Consequently, inorganic beings are infinitely moredurable than we are.\"There is something hauntingly appealing about the long life of those creatures,and the old seers could not resist being carried away by that appeal.\"He said that the same force can produce two effects that are diametricallyopposed. The old seers were imprisoned by the rolling force, and the new seersare rewarded for their toils with the gift of freedom.The new seers become familiar with the rolling force through the mastery ofintent, and at a given moment they open their own cocoons and the force floodsthem- as opposed to rolling them up like a curled up sow bug. The final resultis their total and instantaneous disintegration.I asked him a lot of questions about the survival of awareness after theluminous being is consumed by the fire from within. He did not answer. He simplychuckled and shrugged his shoulders.He went on to say that the old seers' obsession with the tumbler blinded them tothe other side of that force. The new seers, with their usual thoroughness inrefusing tradition, went to the other extreme. They were at first totally averseto focusing their seeing on the tumbler. They argued that they needed tounderstand the force of the emanations at large in its aspect as life-giver andenhancer of awareness.\"They realized,\" don Juan went on, \"that it is infinitely easier to destroysomething than it is to build it and maintain it. To roll life away is nothingcompared to giving it and nourishing it. Of course, the new seers were wrong onthis count, but in due course they corrected their mistake.\"\"How were they wrong, don Juan?\"\"It's an error to isolate anything for seeing. At the beginning, the new seersdid exactly the opposite from what their predecessors did. They focused withequal attention on the other side of the tumbler. What happened to them was asterrible as, if not worse than, what happened to the old seers.\"They died stupid deaths, just as the average man does. They did not have themystery and the malignancy of the ancient seers; but neither did they have thequest for freedom of the seers of today.\"Those first new seers served everybody. And because they were focusing theirseeing on the life-giving side of the emanations, they were filled with love andkindness. But that didn't keep them from being tumbled. They were vulnerable,just as were the old seers who were filled with morbidity.\"He said that for the modern-day new seers, to be left stranded after a life ofdiscipline and toil, just like men who have never had a purposeful moment intheir lives, was intolerable.Don Juan said that these new seers realized, after they had readopted theirtradition, that the old seers' knowledge of the rolling force had been complete.At one point the old seers had concluded that there were, in effect, twodifferent aspects of the same force.The tumbling aspect relates exclusively to destruction and death. The circularaspect, on the other hand, is what maintains life and awareness, fulfillment andpurpose. The old seers had chosen, however, to deal exclusively with thetumbling aspect.\"Gazing in teams, the new seers were able to see the separation between thetumbling and the circular aspects,\" he explained. \"They saw that both forces arefused, but are not the same. The circular force comes to us just before thetumbling force. They are so close to each other that they only seemed the same.\"The reason it's called the circular force is that it comes in rings, threadlikehoops of iridescence- a very delicate affair indeed. And just like the tumblingforce, it strikes all living beings ceaselessly but for a different purpose. Thecircular force strikes them to give them strength, direction, and awareness; togive them life.\"What the new seers discovered is that the balance of the two forces in everyliving being is a very delicate one,\" he continued, \"if at any given time anindividual feels that the tumbling force strikes harder than the circular one,that means the balance is upset. The tumbling force strikes harder and harderfrom then on, until it cracks the living being's gap and makes it die.\"He added that out of what I had called balls of fire comes an iridescent hoopexactly the size of living beings, whether men, trees, microbes, or allies.\"Are there different-size circles?\" I asked.\"Don't take me so literally,\" he protested. \"There are no circles to speak of,just a circular force that gives seers, who are dreaming it, the feeling ofrings. And there are no different sizes either. It's one indivisible force thatfits all living beings, organic and inorganic.\"\"Why did the old seers focus on the tumbling aspect?\" I asked.\"Because they believed that their lives depended on seeing it,\" he replied.\"They were sure that their seeing was going to give them answers to age-oldquestions.\"You see, they figured that if they unraveled the secrets of the rolling forcethey would be invulnerable and immortal. The sad part is that in one way oranother they did unravel the secrets, and yet they were neither invulnerable norimmortal.\"The new seers changed it all by realizing that there is no way to aspire toimmortality as long as man has a cocoon.\"Don Juan explained that the old seers apparently never realized that the humancocoon is a receptacle and cannot sustain the onslaught of the rolling forceforever. In spite of all the knowledge that they had accumulated, they were inthe end certainly no better, and perhaps much worse off than the average man.\"In what way were they left worse off than the average man?\" I asked.\"Their tremendous knowledge forced them to take it for granted that theirchoices were infallible,\" he said. \"So they chose to live at any cost.\"Don Juan looked at me and smiled. With his theatrical pause he was telling mesomething I could not fathom.He said, \"They chose to live: Just as they chose to become trees in order toassemble worlds with those nearly unreachable great bands.\"\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\"\"I mean that they used the rolling force to shift their assemblage points tounimaginable dreaming positions instead of letting it roll them to the beak ofthe Eagle to be devoured.\"================================================================="},{"pageContent":"15. The Death DefiersI arrived at Genaro's house around 2:00 p.m. Don Juan and I became involved inconversation, and then don Juan made me shift into heightened awareness.\"Here we are again, the three of us, just as we were the day we went to thatflat rock,\" don Juan said. \"And tonight we're going to make another trip to thatarea.\"You have enough knowledge now to draw very serious conclusions about that placeand its effects on awareness.\"\"What is it with that place, don Juan?\"\"Tonight you're going to find out some gruesome facts that the old seerscollected about the rolling force; and you're going to see what I meant when Itold you that the old seers chose to live at any cost.\"Don Juan turned to Genaro, who was about to fall asleep. He nudged him.\"Wouldn't you say, Genaro, that the old seers were dreadful men?\" don Juanasked.\"Absolutely,\" Genaro said in a crisp tone and then seemed to succumb to fatigue.He began to nod noticeably. In an instant he was sound asleep, his head restingon his chest with his chin tucked in. He snored.I wanted to laugh out loud. But then I noticed that Genaro was staring at me, asif he were sleeping with his eyes open.\"They were such dreadful men that they even defied death,\" Genaro added betweensnores.\"Aren't you curious to know how those gruesome men defied death?\" don Juan askedme.He seemed to be urging me to ask for an example of their gruesomeness. He pausedand looked at me with what I thought was a glint of expectation in his eyes.\"You're waiting for me to ask for an example, aren't you?\" I said.\"This is a great moment,\" he said, patting me on the back and laughing. \"Mybenefactor had me on the edge of my seat at this point. I asked him to give mean example, and he did. Now I'm going to give you one whether you ask for it ornot.\"\"What are you going to do?\" I asked, so frightened that my stomach was tied inknots and my voice cracked.It took quite a while for don Juan to stop laughing. Every time he started tospeak, he'd get an attack of coughing laughter.\"As Genaro told you, the old seers were dreadful men,\" he said, rubbing hiseyes. \"There was something they tried to avoid at all costs: They didn't want todie.\"You may say that the average man doesn't want to die either, but the advantagethat the old seers had over the average man was that they had the concentrationand the discipline to intend things away; and they actually intended deathaway.\"He paused and looked at me with raised eyebrows. He said that I was fallingbehind; that I was not asking my usual questions.I remarked that it was plain to me that he was leading me to ask if the oldseers had succeeded in intending death away, but he himself had already told methat their knowledge about the tumbler had not saved them from dying.\"They succeeded in intending death away,\" he said, pronouncing his words withextra care. \"But they still had to die.\"\"How did they intend death away?\" I asked.\"They observed their allies,\" he said, \"and seeing that they were living beingswith a much greater resilience to the rolling force, the seers patternedthemselves on their allies.\"\"The old seers realized,\" don Juan explained, \"that only organic beings have agap that resembles a bowl. Its size, shape, and its brittleness make it theideal configuration to hasten the cracking and collapsing of the luminous shellunder the onslaughts of the tumbling force.\"The allies, on the other hand, have only a line for a gap. The allies thereforepresent such a small surface to the rolling force that they are practicallyimmortal. Their cocoons can sustain the onslaughts of the tumbler indefinitelybecause hairline gaps offer no ideal configuration to it.\"The old seers,\" don Juan continued, \"developed the most bizarre techniques forclosing their gaps. They were essentially correct in assuming that a hairlinegap is more durable than a bowl-like one.\"\"Are those techniques still in existence?\" I asked.\"No, they are not,\" he said. \"But some of the seers who practiced them are.\"For reasons unknown to me, his statement caused a reaction of sheer terror inme. My breathing was altered instantly, and I couldn't control its rapid pace.\"They're still alive to this day, isn't that so, Genaro?\" don Juan asked.\"Absolutely,\" Genaro muttered from an apparent state of deep sleep.I asked don Juan if he knew the reason for my being so frightened. He remindedme about a previous occasion in that very room when they had asked me if I hadnoticed the weird creatures that had come in the moment Genaro opened the door.\"That day,\" he went on, \"your assemblage point went very deep into the left sideand assembled a frightening world.\"But I have already said that to you. What you don't remember is that you wentdirectly to a very remote world and scared yourself pissless there.\"Don Juan turned to Genaro, who was snoring peacefully with his legs stretchedout in front of him.\"Wasn't he scared pissless, Genaro?\" he asked.\"Absolutely pissless,\" Genaro muttered, and don Juan laughed.\"I want you to know,\" don Juan continued, \"that we don't blame you for beingscared. We ourselves are revolted by some of the actions of the old seers. I'msure that you have realized by now that what you can't remember about that nightis that you saw the old seers who are still alive.\"I wanted to protest that I had realized nothing, but I could not voice my words.I had to clear my throat over and over before I could articulate a word. Genarohad stood up and was gently patting my upper back, by my neck, as if I werechoking.\"You have a frog in your throat,\" he said.I thanked him in a high squeaky voice.\"No, I think you have a chicken there,\" he added and sat down to sleep.Don Juan said that the new seers had rebelled against all the bizarre practicesof the old seers, and had declared them not only useless but injurious to ourtotal being. They even went so far as to ban those techniques from whatever wastaught to new warriors; and for generations there was no mention of thosepractices at all.It was in the early part of the eighteenth century that the nagual Sebastian, amember of don Juan's direct line of naguals, rediscovered the existence of thosetechniques.\"How did he rediscover them?\" I asked.\"He was a superb stalker, and because of his impeccability he got a chance tolearn marvels,\" don Juan replied. Don Juan said that one day as the nagual Sebastian was about to start his dailyroutines as the sexton [* sexton- an officer of the church who is in charge ofsacred objects] at the cathedral in the city where he lived, he found amiddle-aged Indian man who seemed to be in a quandary [* quandary- a situationfrom which disentanglement is difficult] at the door of the church.The nagual Sebastian went to the man's side and asked him if he needed help.\"I need a bit of energy to close my gap,\" the man said to him in a loud clearvoice. \"Would you give me some of your energy?\"Don Juan said that according to the story, the nagual Sebastian was dumbfounded.He did not know what the man was talking about. He offered to take the Indian tosee the parish priest. The man lost his patience and angrily accused the nagualSebastian of stalling.\"I need your energy because you're a nagual,\" the man said. \"Let's go quietly.\"The nagual Sebastian succumbed to the magnetic power of the stranger and meeklywent with him into the mountains. He was gone for many days.When the nagual Sebastian came back he not only had a new outlook about theancient seers, but he also had detailed knowledge of their techniques. Thestrange old man was an ancient Toltec; one of the last survivors.\"The nagual Sebastian,\" don Juan went on, \"found out marvels about the oldseers. He was the one who first knew how grotesque and aberrant they reallywere. Before him, that knowledge was only hearsay. \"One night,\" don Juan said, \"my benefactor and the nagual Elias gave me a sampleof those aberrations. They actually showed it to Genaro and me together, so it'sonly proper that we both show you the same sample.\"I wanted to talk in order to stall. I needed time to calm down; to think thingsout. But before I could say anything, don Juan and Genaro were practicallydragging me out of the house. They headed for the same eroded hills we hadvisited before.We stopped at the bottom of a large barren hill. Don Juan pointed toward somedistant mountains to the south, and said that between the place where we stoodand a natural cut in one of those mountains- a cut that looked like an openmouth- there were at least seven sites where the ancient seers had focused allthe power of their awareness.Don Juan said that those seers had not only been knowledgeable and daring, butdownright successful. He added that his benefactor had showed Genaro and him asite where the old seers, driven by their love for life, had buried themselvesalive, and had actually intended the rolling force away.\"There is nothing that would catch the eye in those places,\" he went on. \"Theold seers were careful not to leave marks. It is just a landscape. One has tosee to know where those places are.\"He said that he did not want to walk to the faraway sites, but would take me tothe one that was nearest. I insisted on knowing what we were after.He said that we were going to see the buried seers, and that for that we weregoing to stay until it got dark under the cover of some green bushes. He pointedthem out. They were perhaps half a mile away up a steep slope.We reached the patch of bushes, and sat down as comfortably as we could. Hebegan then to explain in a very low voice that in order to get energy from theearth, ancient seers used to bury themselves for a period of time which dependedon what they wanted to accomplish. The more difficult their task, the longertheir burial period.Don Juan stood up, and in a melodramatic way showed me a spot a few yards fromwhere we were.\"Two old seers are buried there,\" he said. \"They buried themselves about twothousand years ago to escape death; not in the spirit of running away from it,but in the spirit of defying it.\"Don Juan asked Genaro to show me the exact spot where the old seers were buried.I turned to look at Genaro, and realized that he was sitting by my side soundasleep again. But to my utter amazement, he jumped up and barked like a dog, andran on all fours to the spot don Juan was pointing out. There he ran around theplace in a perfect mime of a small dog.I found his performance hilarious. Don Juan was nearly on the ground laughing.After Genaro returned to where we were and went back to sleep, don Juan said,\"Genaro has shown you something extraordinary. He has shown you something aboutthe assemblage point and dreaming. He's dreaming now, but he can act as if hewere fully awake and he can hear everything you say. From that position he cando more than if he were awake.\"He was silent for a moment as if assessing what to say next. Genaro snoredrhythmically.Don Juan remarked how easy it was for him to find flaws with what the old seershad done, yet, in all fairness, he never tired of repeating how wonderful theiraccomplishments were.He said that they understood the earth to perfection. Not only did they discoverand use the boost from the earth, but they also discovered that if they remainedburied, their assemblage points aligned emanations that were ordinarilyinaccessible; and that such an alignment engaged the earth's strange,inexplicable capacity to deflect the ceaseless strikes of the rolling force.Consequently, they developed the most astounding and complex techniques forburying themselves for extremely long periods of time without any detriment tothemselves. In their fight against death, they learned how to elongate thoseperiods to cover millennia.It was a cloudy day, and night fell quickly. In no time at all, everything wasin darkness. Don Juan stood up and guided me and the sleepwalker Genaro to anenormous flat oval rock that had caught my eye the moment we got to that place.It was similar to the flat rock we had visited before, but bigger. It occurredto me that the rock, enormous as it was, had deliberately been placed there.\"This is another site,\" don Juan said. \"This huge rock was placed here as a trapto attract people. Soon you'll know why.\"I felt a shiver run through my body. I thought I was going to faint. I knew thatI was definitely overreacting and wanted to say something about it, but don Juankept on talking in a hoarse whisper.He said that Genaro, since he was dreaming, had enough control over hisassemblage point to move it until he could reach the specific emanations thatwould wake up whatever was around that rock. He recommended that I try to movemy assemblage point, and follow Genaro's. He said that I could do it, first bysetting up my unbending intent to move it, and second by letting the context ofthe situation dictate where it should move.After a moment's thought he whispered in my ear not to worry about procedures,because most of the really unusual things that happen to seers, or to theaverage man for that matter, happen by themselves with only the intervention ofintent.He was silent for a moment and then added that the danger for me was going to bethe buried seers' inevitable attempt to scare me to death. He exhorted me tofollow Genaro's movements, keep myself calm, and not succumb to fear.I fought desperately not to be sick. Don Juan patted me on the back and saidthat I was an old pro at playing an innocent bystander. He assured me that I wasnot consciously refusing to let my assemblage point move, but that every humanbeing does it automatically.\"Something is going to scare the living daylights out of you,\" he whispered.\"Don't give up, because if you do, you'll die and the old vultures around hereare going to feast on your energy.\"\"Let's get out of here,\" I pleaded. \"I really don't give a damn about getting anexample of the old seers' grotesqueness.\"\"It's too late,\" Genaro said, fully awake now and standing by my side. \"Even ifwe try to get away, the two seers and their allies on the other spot will cutyou down. They have already made a circle around us. There are as many assixteen awarenesses focused on you right now.\"\"Who are they?\" I whispered in Genaro's ear.\"The four seers and their court,\" he replied. \"They've been aware of us since wegot here.\"I wanted to turn tail and run for dear life, but don Juan held my arm andpointed to the sky. I noticed that a remarkable change in visibility had takenplace. Instead of the pitch-black darkness that had prevailed, there was apleasant dawn twilight. I made a quick assessment of the cardinal points. Thesky was definitely lighter toward the east.I felt a strange pressure around my head. My ears were buzzing. I felt cold andfeverish at the same time. I was scared as I had never been before, but whatbothered me was a nagging sensation of defeat; of being a coward. I feltnauseated and miserable.Don Juan whispered in my ear. He said that I had to be on the alert, that theonslaught of the old seers would be felt by all three of us at any moment.\"You can grab on to me if you want to,\" Genaro said in a fast whisper as ifsomething were prodding him.I hesitated for an instant. I did not want don Juan to believe that I was soscared I needed to hold on to Genaro.\"Here they come!\" Genaro said in a loud whisper.The world turned upside down instantaneously for me when something gripped me bymy left ankle. I felt the coldness of death on my entire body. I felt I hadstepped on an iron clamp like a bear trap. That all flashed through my mindbefore I let out a piercing scream, as intense as my fright.Don Juan and Genaro laughed out loud. They were flanking me no more than threefeet away, but I was so terrified I did not even notice them.\"Sing! Sing for dear life!\" I heard don Juan ordering me under his breath.I tried to pull my foot loose. I felt then a sting, as if needles were piercingmy skin. Don Juan insisted over and over that I sing. He and Genaro started tosing a popular song. Genaro spoke the lyrics as he looked at me from hardly twoinches away. They sang off-key in raspy voices, getting so completely out ofbreath and so high out of the range of their voices that I ended up laughing.\"Sing, or you're going to perish,\" don Juan said to me.\"Let's make a trio,\" Genaro said, \"We'll sing a bolero.\"I joined them in an off-key trio. We sang for quite a while at the top of ourvoices, like drunkards. I felt that the iron grip on my leg was graduallyletting go of me. I had not dared to look down at my ankle. At one moment I didand I realized then that there was no trap clutching me. A dark, headlike shapewas biting me!Only a supreme effort kept me from fainting. I felt I was getting sick andautomatically tried to bend over, but somebody with superhuman strength grabbedme painlessly by the elbows and the nape of my neck and did not let me move. Igot sick all over my clothes.My revulsion was so complete that I began to fall in a faint. Don Juan sprinkledmy face with some water from the small gourd he always carried when we went intothe mountains. The water slid under my collar. The coldness restored my physicalbalance, but it did not affect the force that was holding me by my elbows andneck.\"I think you are going too far with your fright,\" don Juan said loudly and insuch a matter-of-fact tone that he created an immediate feeling of order.\"Let's sing again,\" he added. \"Let's sing a song with substance- I don't wantany more boleros.\"I silently thanked him for his sobriety and for his grand style. As I heard themsinging \"La Valentina\", I was so moved that I began to weep. \"Because of my passion, they saythat ill fortune is on my way.It doesn't matterthat it might be the devil himself.I do know how to die. Valentina, Valentina.I throw my self in your way.If I am going to die tomorrow,why not, once and for all, today?\" All of my being staggered under the impact of that inconceivable juxtapositionof values. Never had a song meant so much to me. As I heard them sing thoselyrics, which I ordinarily considered reeking with cheap sentimentalism, Ithought I understood the ethos of the warrior.Don Juan had drilled into me that warriors live with death at their side; andfrom the knowledge that death is with them they draw the courage to faceanything. Don Juan had said that the worst that could happen to us is that wehave to die, and since that is already our unalterable fate, we are free. Thosewho have lost everything no longer have anything to fear.I walked to don Juan and Genaro, and embraced them to express my boundlessgratitude and admiration for them.Then I realized that nothing was holding me any longer. Without a word, don Juantook my arm and guided me to sit on the flat rock.\"The show is just about to begin now,\" Genaro said in a jovial tone as he triedto find a comfortable position to sit. \"You've just paid your admission ticket.It's all over your chest.\"He looked at me, and both of them began to laugh.\"Don't sit too close to me,\" Genaro said. \"I don't appreciate pukers. But don'tgo too far, either. The old seers are not through with their tricks yet.\"I moved as close to them as politeness permitted. I was concerned about my statefor an instant. Then all my qualms became nonsense because I noticed that somepeople were coming toward us.I could not make out their shapes clearly, but I distinguished a mass of humanfigures moving in the semidarkness. They did not carry lanterns or flashlightswith them, which at that hour they would still have needed. Somehow that detailworried me. I did not want to focus on it and I deliberately began to thinkrationally.I figured that we must have attracted attention with our loud singing and theywere coming to investigate. Don Juan tapped me on the shoulder. He pointed witha movement of his chin to the men in front of the group of others.\"Those four are the old seers,\" he said. \"The rest are their allies.\"Before I could remark that they were just local peasants, I heard a swishingsound right behind me. I quickly turned around in a state of total alarm. Mymovement was so sudden that don Juan's warning came too late.\"Don't turn around!\" I heard him yell.His words were only background. They did not mean anything to me.On turning around, I saw that three grotesquely deformed men had climbed up onthe rock right behind me. They were crawling toward me with their mouths open ina nightmarish grimace, and their arms outstretched to grab me.I intended to scream at the top of my lungs, but what came out was an agonizingcroak, as if something were obstructing my windpipe. I automatically rolled outof their reach and onto the ground.As I stood up, don Juan jumped to my side, at the very same moment that a hordeof men, led by those don Juan had pointed out, descended on me like vultures.They were actually squeaking like bats or rats.I yelled in terror. This time I was able to let out a piercing cry.Don Juan, as nimbly as an athlete in top form, pulled me out of their clutchesonto the rock. He told me in a stern voice not to turn around to look, no matterhow scared I was.He said that the allies cannot push at all, but that they certainly could scareme and make me fall to the ground. On the ground, however, the allies could holdanybody down. If I were to fall on the ground by the place where the seers wereburied, I would be at their mercy. They would rip me apart while their alliesheld me.He added that he had not told me all that before because he had hoped I would beforced to see and understand it by myself. His decision had nearly cost me mylife.The sensation that the grotesque men were just behind me was nearly unbearable.Don Juan forcefully ordered me to keep calm and focus my attention on four menat the head of a crowd of perhaps ten or twelve.The instant I focused my eyes on them, as if on cue, they all advanced to theedge of the flat rock. They stopped there and began hissing like serpents. Theywalked back and forth. Their movement seemed to be synchronized. It was soconsistent and orderly that it seemed to be mechanical. It was as if they werefollowing a repetitive pattern aimed at mesmerizing me.\"Don't gaze at them, dear,\" Genaro said to me as if he were talking to a child.The laughter that followed was as hysterical as my fear. I laughed so hard thatthe sound reverberated on the surrounding hills.The men stopped at once and seemed to be perplexed. I could distinguish theshapes of their heads bobbing up and down as if they were talking, deliberatingamong themselves. Then one of them jumped onto the rock.\"Watch out! That one is a seer!\" Genaro exclaimed.\"What are we going to do?\" I shouted.\"We could start singing again,\" don Juan replied matter-of-factly.My fear reached its apex then. I began to jump up and down and to roar like ananimal. The man jumped down to the ground.\"Don't pay any more attention to those clowns,\" don Juan said. \"Let's talk asusual.\"He said that we had gone there for my enlightenment, and that I was failingmiserably. I had to reorganize myself. The first thing to do was to realize thatmy assemblage point had moved and was now making obscure emanations glow. Tocarry the feelings from my usual state of awareness into the world I hadassembled was indeed a travesty, for fear is only prevalent among the emanationsof daily life.I told him that if my assemblage point had shifted as he was saying it had, Ihad news for him. My fear was infinitely greater and more devastating thananything I had ever experienced in my daily life.\"You're wrong,\" he said. \"Your first attention is confused and doesn't want togive up control, that's all. I have the feeling that you could walk right up tothose creatures and face them, and they wouldn't do a thing to you.\"I insisted that I was definitely in no condition to test such a preposterousthing as that.He laughed at me. He said that sooner or later I had to cure myself of mymadness, and that to take the initiative and face up to those four seers wasinfinitely less preposterous than the idea that I was seeing them at all. Hesaid that, to him, madness was to be confronted by men who had been buried fortwo thousand years and were still alive, and not to think that that was theepitome of preposterousness.I heard everything he said with clarity, but I was not really paying attentionto him. I was terrified of the men around the rock. They seemed to be preparingto jump us, to jump me really. They were fixed on me. My right arm began toshake as if I were stricken by some muscular disorder. Then I became aware thatthe light in the sky had changed. I had not noticed before that it was alreadydawn. The strange thing was that an uncontrollable urge made me stand up and runto the group of men.I had at that moment two completely different feelings about the same event. Theminor one was of sheer terror. The other, the major one, was of totalindifference. I could not have cared less.When I reached the group I realized that don Juan was right. They were notreally men. Only four of them had any resemblance to men, but they were not meneither. They were strange creatures with huge yellow eyes. The others were justshapes that were propelled by the four that resembled men.I felt extraordinarily sad for those creatures with yellow eyes. I tried totouch them, but I could not find them. Some sort of wind scooped them away.I looked for don Juan and Genaro. They were not there. It was pitch-black again.I called out their names over and over again. I thrashed around in darkness fora few minutes. Don Juan came to my side and startled me. I did not see Genaro.\"Let's go home,\" he said. \"We have a long walk.\" Don Juan commented on how well I had performed at the site of the buried seers,especially during the last part of our encounter with them. He said that a shiftof the assemblage point is marked by a change in light. In the daytime, lightbecomes very dark. At night, darkness becomes twilight.He added that I had performed two shifts by myself, aided only by animal fright.The only thing he found objectionable was my indulging in fear, especially afterI had realized that warriors have nothing to fear.\"How do you know I had realized that?\" I asked.\"Because you were free. When fear disappears all the ties that bind usdissolve,\" he said. \"An ally was gripping your foot because it was attracted byyour animal terror.\"I told him how sorry I was for not being able to uphold my realizations.\"Don't concern yourself with that.\" He laughed. \"You know that such realizationsare a dime a dozen. They don't amount to anything in the life of warriorsbecause they are canceled out as the assemblage point shifts.\"What Genaro and I wanted to do was to make you shift very deeply. This timeGenaro was there simply to entice the old seers. He did it once already, and youwent so far into the left side that it will take quite a while for you toremember it.\"Your fright tonight was just as intense as it was that first time when theseers and their allies followed you to this very room, but your sturdy firstattention wouldn't let you be aware of them.\"\"Explain to me what happened at the site of the seers,\" I asked.\"The allies came out to see you,\" he replied. \"Since they have very low energy,they always need the help of men. The four seers have collected twelve allies.\"The countryside in Mexico and also certain cities are dangerous. What happenedto you can happen to any man or woman. If they bump into that tomb, they mayeven see the seers and their allies if they are pliable enough to let their fearmake their assemblage points shift; but one thing is for sure: They can die offright.\"\"But do you honestly believe that those Toltec seers are still alive?\" I asked.He laughed and shook his head in disbelief.\"It's time for you to shift that assemblage point of yours just a bit,\" he said.\"I can't talk to you when you are in your idiot's stage.\"He smacked me with the palm of his hand on three spots: right on the crest of myright hipbone; on the center of my back below my shoulder blades; and on theupper part of my right pectoral muscle.My ears immediately began to buzz. A trickle of blood ran out of my rightnostril, and something inside me became unplugged. It was as if some flow ofenergy had been blocked and suddenly began to move again.\"What were those seers and their allies after?\" I asked.\"Nothing,\" he replied. \"We were the ones who were after them. The seers, ofcourse, had already noticed your field of energy the first time you saw them.When you came back, they were set to feast on you.\"\"You claim that they are alive, don Juan,\" I said. \"You must mean that they arealive as allies are alive, is that so?\"\"That's exactly right,\" he said. \"They cannot possibly be alive as you and Iare. That would be preposterous.\"He went on to explain that the ancient seers' concern with death made them lookinto the most bizarre possibilities. The ones who opted for the allies' patternhad in mind, doubtless, a desire for a haven. And they found it at a fixedposition in one of the seven bands of inorganic awareness. The seers felt thatthey were relatively safe there. After all, they were separated from the dailyworld by a nearly insurmountable barrier; the barrier of perception set by theassemblage point.\"When the four seers saw that you could shift your assemblage point they tookoff like bats out of hell,\" he said and laughed.\"Do you mean that I assembled one of the seven worlds?\" I asked.\"No, you didn't,\" he replied. \"But you have done it before when the seers andtheir allies chased you. That day you went all the way to their world. Theproblem is that you love to act stupid, so you can't remember it at all.\"I'm sure,\" he continued, \"that it is the nagual's presence that sometimes makespeople act dumb. When the nagual Julian was still around, I was dumber than I amnow. I am convinced that when I'm no longer here, you'll be capable ofremembering everything.\"Don Juan explained that since he needed to show me the death defiers, he andGenaro had lured them to the outskirts of our world. What I had done at firstwas a deep lateral shift, which allowed me to see them as people, but at the endI had correctly made the shift that allowed me to see the death defiers andtheir allies as they are. Very early the next morning at Silvio Manuel's house, don Juan called me to thebig room to discuss the events of the previous night. I felt exhausted andwanted to rest or to sleep, but don Juan was pressed for time. He immediatelystarted his explanation.He said that the old seers had found out a way to utilize the rolling force andbe propelled by it. Instead of succumbing to the onslaughts of the tumbler theyrode with it and let it move their assemblage points to the confines of humanpossibilities.Don Juan expressed unbiased admiration for such an accomplishment. He admittedthat nothing else could give the assemblage point the boost that the tumblergives.I asked him about the difference between the earth's boost and the tumbler'sboost. He explained that the earth's boost is the force of alignment of only theamber emanations. It is a boost that heightens awareness to unthinkable degrees.To the new seers it is a blast of unlimited consciousness which they call totalfreedom.He said that the tumbler's boost, on the other hand, is the force of death.Under the impact of the tumbler, the assemblage point moves to new,unpredictable positions. Thus, the old seers were always alone in theirjourneys, although the enterprise they were involved in was always communal. Thecompany of other seers on their journeys was fortuitous and usually meantstruggle for supremacy.I confessed to don Juan that the concerns of the old seers, whatever they mayhave been, were worse than morbid horror tales to me. He laughed uproariously.He seemed to be enjoying himself.\"You have to admit, no matter how disgusted you feel, that those devils werevery daring,\" he went on. \"I never liked them myself, as you know, but I can'thelp admiring them. Their love for life is truly beyond me.\"\"How can that be love for life, don Juan? It's something nauseating,\" I said.\"What else could push a man to those extremes if it is not love for life?\" heasked. \"They loved life so intensely that they were not willing to give it up.That's the way I have seen it.\"My benefactor saw something else. He believed that they were afraid to die,which is not the same as loving life.\"I say that they were afraid to die because they loved life and because they hadseen marvels, and not because they were greedy little monsters. No. They wereaberrant because nobody ever challenged them and they were spoiled like rottenchildren; but their daring was impeccable and so was their courage.\"Would you venture into the unknown out of greed? No way. Greed works only inthe world of ordinary affairs. To venture into that terrifying loneliness onemust have something greater than greed; Love. One needs love for life, forintrigue, and for mystery. One needs unquenching curiosity and guts galore. Sodon't give me this nonsense about your being revolted. It's embarrassing!\"Don Juan's eyes were shining with contained laughter. He was putting me in myplace, but he was laughing at it.Don Juan left me alone in the room for perhaps an hour. I wanted to organize mythoughts and feelings. I had no way to do that. I knew without any doubt that myassemblage point was at a position where reasoning does not prevail, yet I wasmoved by reasonable concerns. Don Juan had said that technically, as soon as theassemblage point shifts, we are asleep. I wondered, for instance, if I was soundasleep from the stand of an onlooker, just as Genaro had been asleep to me.I asked don Juan about it as soon as he returned.\"You are absolutely asleep without having to be stretched out,\" he replied. \"Ifpeople in a normal state of awareness saw you now, you would appear to them tobe a bit dizzy, even drunk.\"He explained that during normal sleep, the shift of the assemblage point runsalong either edge of man's band. Such shifts are always coupled with slumber.Shifts that are induced by practice occur along the midsection of man's band andare not coupled with slumber, yet a dreamer is asleep.\"Right at this juncture is where the new and the old seers made their separatebids for power,\" he went on. \"The old seers wanted a replica of the body butwith more physical strength, so they made their assemblage points slide alongthe right edge of man's band. The deeper they moved along the right edge themore bizarre their dreaming body became. You yourself witnessed last night themonstrous result of a deep shift along the right edge.\"He said that the new seers were completely different; that they maintain theirassemblage points along the midsection of man's band. If the shift is a shallowone, like the shift into heightened awareness, the dreamer is almost like anyoneelse in the street except for a slight vulnerability to emotions, such as fearand doubt. But at a certain degree of depth, the dreamer who is shifting alongthe midsection becomes a blob of light. A blob of light is the dreaming body ofthe new seers.He also said that such an impersonal dreaming body is more conducive tounderstanding and examination, which are the basis of all the new seers do. Theintensely humanized dreaming body of the old seers drove them to look foranswers that were equally personal; humanized.Don Juan suddenly seemed to be groping for words. \"There is another death defier,\" he said curtly, \"so unlike the four you've seenthat he's indistinguishable from the average man in the street. He'saccomplished this unique feat by being able to open and close his gap wheneverhe wants.\"He played with his fingers almost nervously.\"The ancient seer that the nagual Sebastian found in 1723 is that death defier,\"he went on. \"We count that day as the beginning of our line, the secondbeginning. That death defier, who's been on the earth for hundreds of years, haschanged the lives of every nagual he met, some more profoundly than others. Andhe has met every single nagual of our line since that day in 1723.\"Don Juan looked fixedly at me. I got strangely embarrassed. I thought myembarrassment was the result of a dilemma. I had very serious doubts about thecontent of the story, and at the same time I had the most disconcerting trustthat everything he had said was true. I expressed my quandary to him.\"The problem of rational disbelief is not yours alone,\" don Juan said. \"Mybenefactor was at first plagued by the same question. Of course, later on heremembered everything. But it took him a long time to do so. When I met him hehad already recollected everything, so I never witnessed his doubts. I onlyheard about them.\"The weird part is that people who have never set eyes on the man have lessdifficulty accepting that he's one of the original seers. My benefactor saidthat his quandaries stemmed from the fact that the shock of meeting such acreature had lumped together a number of emanations. It takes time for thoseemanations to separate themselves.\"Don Juan went on to explain that as my assemblage point kept on shifting, amoment would come when it would hit the proper combination of emanations. Atthat moment the proof of the existence of that man would become overwhelminglyevident to me.I felt compelled to talk again about my ambivalence.\"We're deviating from our subject,\" he said. \"It may seem that I'm trying toconvince you of the existence of that man; and what I meant to talk about is thefact that the old seer knows how to handle the rolling force. Whether or not youbelieve that he exists is not important. Someday you'll know for a fact that hecertainly succeeded in closing his gap. The energy that he borrows from thenagual every generation he uses exclusively to close his gap.\"\"How did he succeed in closing it?\" I asked.\"There is no way of knowing that,\" he replied. \"I've talked to two other nagualswho saw that man face to face, the nagual Julian and the nagual Elias. Neitherof them knew how. The man never revealed how he closes that opening, which Isuppose begins to expand after a time. The nagual Sebastian said that when hefirst saw the old seer, the man was very weak, actually dying. But my benefactorfound him prancing vigorously, like a young man.\"Don Juan said that the nagual Sebastian nicknamed that nameless man 'thetenant', because they had struck an arrangement by which the man was givenenergy, lodging so to speak, and he paid rent in the form of favors andknowledge.\"Did anybody ever get hurt in the exchange?\" I asked.\"None of the naguals who exchanged energy with him was injured,\" he replied.\"The man's commitment was that he'd only take a bit of superfluous energy fromthe nagual in exchange for gifts; for extraordinary abilities. For instance, thenagual Julian got the gait of power. With it, he could activate or make dormantthe emanations inside his cocoon in order to look young or old at will.\"Don Juan explained that the death defiers in general went as far as renderingdormant all the emanations inside their cocoons, except those that matched theemanations of the allies. In this fashion they were able to imitate the alliesin some form.Each of the death defiers we had encountered at the rock, don Juan said, hadbeen able to move his assemblage point to a precise spot on his cocoon in orderto emphasize the emanations shared with the allies and to interact with them.But they were all unable to move it back to its usual position and interact withpeople. The tenant, on the other hand, is capable of shifting his assemblagepoint to assemble the everyday world as if nothing had ever happened.Don Juan also said that his benefactor was convinced- and he fully agreed withhim- that what takes place during the borrowing of energy is that the oldsorcerer moves the nagual's assemblage point to emphasize the ally's emanationsinside the nagual's cocoon. He then uses the great jolt of energy produced bythose emanations that suddenly become aligned after being so deeply dormant.He said that the energy locked within us, in the dormant emanations, has atremendous force and an incalculable scope. We can only vaguely assess the scopeof that tremendous force, if we consider that the energy involved in perceivingand acting in the world of everyday life is a product of the alignment of hardlyone-tenth of the emanations encased in man's cocoon.\"What happens at the moment of death is that all that energy is released atonce,\" he continued. \"Living beings at that moment become flooded by the mostinconceivable force.\"It is not the rolling force that has cracked their gaps, because that forcenever enters inside the cocoon; it only makes it collapse.\"What floods them is the force of all the emanations that are suddenly alignedafter being dormant for a lifetime. There is no outlet for such a giant forceexcept to escape through the gap.\"He added that the old sorcerer has found a way to tap that energy. By aligning alimited and very specific spectrum of the dormant emanations inside the nagual'scocoon, the old seer taps a limited but gigantic jolt.\"How do you think he takes that energy into his own body?\" I asked.\"By cracking the nagual's gap,\" he replied. \"He moves the nagual's assemblagepoint until the gap opens a little. When the energy of newly aligned emanationsis released through that opening, he takes it into his own gap.\"\"Why is that old seer doing what he's doing?\" I asked.\"My opinion is that he's caught in a circle he can't break,\" he replied. \"We gotinto an agreement with him. He's doing his best to keep it, and so are we. Wecan't judge him, yet we have to know that his path doesn't lead to freedom. Heknows that, and he also knows he can't change it. He's trapped in a situation ofhis own making. The only thing he can do is to prolong his ally-like existenceas long as he possibly can.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"16. The Mold of ManRight after lunch, don Juan and I sat down to talk. He started without anypreamble. He announced that we had come to the end of his explanation. He saidthat he had discussed with me, in painstaking detail, all the truths aboutawareness that the old seers had discovered.He stressed that I now knew the order in which the new seers had arranged them.In the last sessions of his explanation, he said, he had given me a detailedaccount of the two forces that aid our assemblage points to move: the earth'sboost and the rolling force. He had also explained the three techniques workedout by the new seers- stalking, intent, and dreaming- and their effects on themovement of the assemblage point.\"Now, the only thing left for you to do before the explanation of the mastery ofawareness is completed,\" he went on, \"is to break the barrier of perception byyourself. You must move your assemblage point, unaided by anyone, and alignanother great band of emanations.\"Not to do this will turn everything you've learned and done with me into merelytalk, just words. And words are fairly cheap.\"He explained that when the assemblage point is moving away from its customaryposition and reaches a certain depth, it breaks a barrier that momentarilydisrupts its capacity to align emanations. We experience it as a moment ofperceptual blankness. The old seers called that moment the wall of fog because abank of fog appears whenever the alignment of emanations falters.He said that there were three ways of dealing with it. It could be takenabstractly as a barrier of perception; it could be felt as the act of piercing atight paper screen with the entire body; or it could be seen as a wall of fog. In the course of my apprenticeship with don Juan, he had guided me countlesstimes to see the barrier of perception. At first I had liked the idea of a wallof fog. Don Juan had warned me that the old seers had also preferred to see itthat way. He had said that there is great comfort and ease in seeing it as awall of fog, but that there is also the grave danger of turning somethingincomprehensible into something somber and foreboding. Hence, his recommendationwas to keep incomprehensible things incomprehensible rather than making thempart of the inventory of the first attention.After a short-lived feeling of comfort in seeing the wall of fog I had to agreewith don Juan that it was better to keep the transition period as anincomprehensible abstraction, but by then it was impossible for me to break thefixation of my awareness. Every time I was placed in a position to break thebarrier of perception I saw the wall of fog.On one occasion in the past, I had complained to don Juan and Genaro thatalthough I wanted to see it as something else, I couldn't change it. Don Juanhad commented that that was understandable, because I was morbid and somber;that he and I were very different in this respect.He was lighthearted and practical and he did not worship the human inventory. I,on the other hand, was unwilling to throw my inventory out the window andconsequently I was heavy, sinister, and impractical. I had been shocked andsaddened by his harsh criticism and became very gloomy. Don Juan and Genaro hadlaughed until tears rolled down their cheeks.Genaro had added that on top of all that I was vindictive and had a tendency toget fat. They had laughed so hard I finally felt obliged to join them.Don Juan had told me then that exercises of assembling other worlds allowed theassemblage point to gain experience in shifting. I had always wondered, however,how to get the initial boost to dislodge my assemblage point from its usualposition.When I'd questioned him about it in the past he'd pointed out that sincealignment is the force that is involved in everything, intent is what makes theassemblage point move.I asked him again about it. \"You're in a position now to answer that question yourself,\" he replied. \"Themastery of awareness is what gives the assemblage point its boost. After all,there is really very little to us human beings. We are, in essence, anassemblage point fixed at a certain position. Our enemy and at the same time ourfriend is our internal dialogue; our inventory.\"Be a warrior. Shut off your internal dialogue. Make your inventory and thenthrow it away. The new seers make accurate inventories and then laugh at them.Without the inventory the assemblage point becomes free.\"Don Juan reminded me that he had talked a great deal about one of the moststurdy aspects of our inventory: Our idea of God. That aspect, he said, was likea powerful glue that bound the assemblage point to its original position. If Iwere going to assemble another true world with another great band of emanations,I had to take an obligatory step in order to release all ties from my assemblagepoint.\"That step is to see the mold of man,\" he said. \"You must do that todayunaided.\"\"What's the mold of man?\" I asked.\"I've helped you see it many times,\" he replied. \"You know what I'm talkingabout.\"I refrained from saying that I did not know what he was talking about. If hesaid that I had seen the mold of man, I must have done it, although I did nothave the foggiest idea what it was like.He knew what was going through my mind. He gave me a knowing smile and slowlyshook his head from side to side.\"The mold of man is a huge cluster of emanations in the great band of organiclife,\" he said. \"It is called the mold of man because the cluster appears onlyinside the cocoon of man.\"The mold of man is the portion of the Eagle's emanations that seers can seedirectly without any danger to themselves.\"There was a long pause before he spoke again.\"To break the barrier of perception is the last task of the mastery ofawareness,\" he said. \"In order to move your assemblage point to that position,you must gather enough energy. Make a journey of recovery. Remember what you'vedone!\"I tried unsuccessfully to recall what was the mold of man. I felt anexcruciating frustration that soon turned into real anger. I was furious withmyself, with don Juan, with everybody.Don Juan was untouched by my fury. He said matter-of-factly that anger was anatural reaction to the hesitation of the assemblage point to move on command.\"It will be a long time before you can apply the principle that your command isthe Eagle's command,\" he said. \"That's the essence of the mastery of intent. Inthe meantime, make a command now not to fret, not even at the worst moments ofdoubt. It will be a slow process until that command is heard and obeyed as if itwere the Eagle's command.\"He also said that there was an unmeasurable area of awareness in between thecustomary position of the assemblage point and the position where there are nomore doubts, which is almost the place where the barrier of perception makes itsappearance. In that unmeasurable area, warriors fall prey to every conceivablemisdeed. He warned me to be on the lookout and not lose confidence because Iwould unavoidably be struck at one time or another by gripping feelings ofdefeat.\"The new seers recommend a very simple act when impatience, or despair, oranger, or sadness comes their way,\" he continued. \"They recommend that warriorsroll their eyes. Any direction will do. I prefer to roll mine clockwise.\"The movement of the eyes makes the assemblage point shift momentarily. In thatmovement, you will find relief. This is in lieu of true mastery of intent.\"'I complained that there was not enough time for him to tell me more aboutintent.\"It will all come back to you someday,\" he assured me. \"One thing will triggeranother. One key word and all of it will tumble out of you as if the door of anoverstuffed closet had given way.\" He went back then to discussing the mold of man. He said that to see it on myown, unaided by anyone, was an important step, because all of us have certainideas that must be broken before we are free. The seer who travels into theunknown to see the unknowable must be in an impeccable state of being.He winked at me and said that to be in an impeccable state of being is to befree of rational assumptions and rational fears. He added that both my rationalassumptions and my rational fears were preventing me at that moment fromrealigning the emanations that would make me remember seeing the mold of man.He urged me to relax and move my eyes in order to make my assemblage pointshift. He repeated over and over that it was really important to remember havingseen the mold before I see it again. And since he was pressed for time there wasno room for my usual slowness.I moved my eyes as he suggested. Almost immediately I forgot my discomfort andthen a sudden flash of memory came to me and I remembered that I had seen themold of man. It had happened years earlier on an occasion that had been quitememorable to me, because from the point of view of my Catholic upbringing, donJuan had made the most sacrilegious statements I had ever heard. It had all started as a casual conversation while we hiked in the foothills ofthe Sonoran desert. He was explaining to me the implications of what he wasdoing to me with his teachings.We had stopped to rest and had sat down on some large boulders. He had continuedexplaining his teaching procedure, and this had encouraged me to try for thehundredth time to give him an account of how I felt about it. It was evidentthat he did not want to hear about it anymore. He made me change levels ofawareness and told me that if I would see the mold of man, I might understandeverything he was doing and thus save us both years of toil.He gave me a detailed explanation of what the mold of man was. He did not talkabout it in terms of the Eagle's emanations, but in terms of a pattern of energythat serves to stamp the qualities of humanness on an amorphous blob ofbiological matter.At least, I understood it that way, especially after he further described themold of man using a mechanical analogy. He said that it was like a gigantic diethat stamps out human beings endlessly as if they were coming to it on a massproduction conveyor belt. He vividly mimed the process by bringing the palms ofhis hands together with great force, as if the die molded a human being eachtime its two halves were clapped.He also said that every species has a mold of its own, and every individual ofevery species molded by the process shows characteristics particular to its ownkind.He began then an extremely disturbing elucidation about the mold of man. He saidthat the old seers as well as the mystics of our world have one thing in common;they have been able to see the mold of man but not understand what it is.Mystics, throughout the centuries, have given us moving accounts of theirexperiences. But these accounts, however beautiful, are flawed by the gross anddespairing mistake of their believing the mold of man to be an omnipotent,omniscient creator.The interpretation of the old seers, is similarily flawed. They called the moldof man a friendly spirit; a protector of man.He said that the new seers are the only ones who have the sobriety to see themold of man and understand what it is. What they have come to realize is thatthe mold of man is not a creator, but the pattern of every human attribute wecan think of and some we cannot even conceive.The mold is our God because we are what it stamps us with and not because it hascreated us from nothing and made us in its image and likeness. Don Juan saidthat in his opinion to fall on our knees in the presence of the mold of manreeks of arrogance and human self-centeredness.As I heard don Juan's explanation I got terribly worried. Even though I hadnever considered my self to be a practicing Catholic, I was shocked by hisblasphemous implications. I had been politely listening to him, yet I had beenyearning for a pause in his barrage of sacrilegious judgments in order to changethe subject.But he went on drumming his point in a merciless way. I finally interrupted himand told him that I believed that God exists.He retorted that my belief was based on faith and, as such, was a secondhandconviction that did not amount to anything.He said my belief in the existence of God was, like everyone else's; based onhearsay, and not on the act of seeing.He assured me that even if I was able to see, I was bound to make the samemisjudgment that mystics have made. Anyone who sees the mold of manautomatically assumes that it is God.He called the mystical experience a chance seeing; a one-shot affair that has nosignificance whatsoever because it is the result of a random movement of theassemblage point. He asserted that the new seers are indeed the only ones whocan pass a fair judgment on this matter because they have ruled out chanceseeings, and are capable of seeing the mold of man as often as they please.They have seen, therefore, that what we call God is a static prototype ofhumanness without any power. The mold of man cannot under any circumstances helpus by intervening in our behalf, or punish our wrongdoings, or reward us in anyway.We are simply the product of its stamp. We are its impression. The mold of manis exactly what its name tells us it is, a pattern, a form, or a cast thatgroups together a particular bunch of fiberlike elements which we call man.What he had said put me in a state of great distress. But he seemed unconcernedwith my genuine turmoil. He kept on needling me with what he called theunforgivable crime of the chance seers which makes us focus our irreplaceableenergy on something that has no power whatsoever to do anything.The more he talked, the greater my annoyance. When I became so annoyed that Iwas about to shout at him, he hit me on my right side between my hipbone and myrib cage.By that means, he sent me into a yet deeper state of heightened awareness. Thatblow sent me soaring into a radiant light; into a diaphanous source of the mostpeaceful and exquisite beatitude. That light was a haven, an oasis in theblackness around me.From my subjective point of view, I saw that light for an immeasurable length oftime. The splendor of the sight was beyond anything I can say, and yet I couldnot figure out what it was that made it so beautiful.Then the idea came to me that its beauty grew out of a sense of harmony, a senseof peace and rest, of having arrived, of being safe at long last. I felt myselfinhaling and exhaling in quietude and relief. What a gorgeous sense ofplenitude!I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that I had come face to face with God; thesource of everything. And I knew that God loved me. God was love andforgiveness. The light bathed me, and I felt clean, delivered. I weptuncontrollably, mainly for myself. The sight of that resplendent light made mefeel unworthy and villainous.Suddenly, I heard don Juan's voice in my ear. He said that I had to go beyondthe mold, that the mold was merely a stage, a stopover that brought temporarypeace and serenity to those who journey into the unknown, but that it wassterile and static. It was at the same time a flat reflected image in a mirrorand the mirror itself. And the image was man's image.I passionately resented what don Juan was saying. I rebelled against hisblasphemous, sacrilegious words. I wanted to tell him off, but I could not breakthe binding power of my seeing. I was caught in it. Don Juan seemed to knowexactly how I felt and what I wanted to tell him.\"You can't tell the nagual off,\" he said in my ear. \"It is the nagual who'senabling you to see. It is the nagual's technique, the nagual's power. Thenagual is the guide.\"It was at that point that I realized something about the voice in my ear. It wasnot don Juan's, although it sounded very much like his voice. Also, the voicewas right. The instigator of that seeing was the nagual Juan Matus. It was histechnique and his power that was making me see God.He said it was not God, but rather the mold of man. I knew that he was right.Yet I could not admit that, not out of annoyance or stubbornness, but simply outof a sense of ultimate loyalty to and love for the divinity that was in front ofme.As I gazed into the light with all the passion I was capable of, the lightseemed to condense and I saw a man; a shiny man that exuded charisma, love,understanding, sincerity, truth; a man that was the sum total of all that isgood.The fervor I felt on seeing that man was well beyond anything I had ever felt inmy life. I did fall on my knees. I wanted to worship God personified, but donJuan intervened and whacked me on my left upper chest, close to my clavicle, andI lost sight of God.I was left with a tantalizing feeling; a mixture of remorse, elation,certainties, and doubts. Don Juan made fun of me. He called me pious andcareless, and said I would make a great priest. Now I could even pass for aspiritual leader who had had a chance seeing of God. He urged me, in ajocularway, to start preaching, and describe what I had seen to everyone.In a very casual but seemingly interested manner he made a statement that waspart question, part assertion.\"And the man?\" he asked. \"You can't forget that God is a male.\"The immensity of something indefinable began to dawn on me as I entered into astate of great clarity.\"Very cozy, eh?\" don Juan had added, smiling. \"God is a male. What a relief\" After recounting to don Juan what I had remembered, I asked him about somethingthat had just struck me as being terribly odd. To see the mold of man, I hadobviously gone through a shift of my assemblage point. The recollection of thefeelings and realizations I had had then was so vivid that it gave me a sense ofutter futility.Everything I had done and felt at that time I was feeling now. I asked him howit was possible that having had such a clear comprehension, I could haveforgotten it so completely. It was as if nothing of what had happened to me hadmattered, for I always had to start from point one regardless of how much Imight have advanced in the past.\"That's only an emotional impression,\" he said. \"A total misapprehension.Whatever you did years ago is solidly enclosed in some unused emanations. Thatday when I made you see the mold of man, for instance, I had a truemisapprehension myself. I thought that if you saw it, you would be able tounderstand it. It was a true misunderstanding on my part.\"Don Juan explained that he had always regarded himself as being very slow tounderstand. He had never had any chance of testing his belief, because he didnot have a point of reference. When I came along and he became a teacher, whichwas something totally new to him, he realized that there is no way to speed upunderstanding and that to dislodge the assemblage point is not enough.He had thought that it would be sufficient. Soon he became aware that since theassemblage point normally shifts during dreams, sometimes to extraordinarilydistant positions, whenever we undergo an induced shift we are all experts atimmediately compensating for it. We rebalance ourselves constantly and activitygoes on as if nothing has happened to us.He remarked that the value of the new seers' conclusions does not become evidentuntil one tries to move someone else's assemblage point. The new seers said thatwhat counts in this respect is the effort to reinforce the stability of theassemblage point in its new position. They considered this to be the onlyteaching procedure worth discussing. And they knew that it is a long processthat has to be carried out little by little at a snail's pace.Don Juan said then that he had used power plants at the beginning of myapprenticeship in accordance with a recommendation of the new seers. They knewby experience and by seeing that power plants shake the assemblage point way outof its normal setting. The effect of power plants on the assemblage point is inprinciple very much like that of dreams: Dreams make it move. But power plantsmanage the shift on a greater and more engulfing scale. A teacher then uses thedisorienting effects of such a shift to reinforce the notion that the perceptionof the world is never final.I remembered then that I had seen the mold of man five more times over theyears. With each new time I had become less passionate about it. I could neverget over the fact, however, that I always saw God as a male. At the end itstopped being God for me and became the mold of man, not because of what donJuan had said, but because the position of a male God became untenable. I couldthen understand don Juan's statements about it.They had not been blasphemous or sacrilegious in the least. He had not made themfrom within the context of the daily world. He was right in saying that the newseers have an edge in being capable of seeing the mold of man as often as theywant. But what was more important to me was that they had sobriety in order toexamine what they saw.I asked him why it was that I always saw the mold of man as a male. He said thatit was because my assemblage point did not have the stability then to remaincompletely glued to its new position and shifted laterally in man's band. It wasthe same case as seeing the barrier of perception as a wall of fog. What madethe assemblage point move laterally was a nearly unavoidable desire, ornecessity, to render the incomprehensible in terms of what is most familiar tous; therefore, any barrier becomes a wall; and similarly, the mold of man cannotbe anything else but a man. He thought that if I were a woman I would see themold as a woman. Don Juan stood up then and said that it was time for us to take a stroll intown, and that I should see the mold of man among people. We walked in silenceto the square, but before we got there I had an uncontainable surge of energyand ran down the street to the outskirts of town. I came to a bridge, and rightthere, as if it had been waiting for me, I saw the mold of man as a resplendent,warm, amber light.I fell on my knees, not so much out of piety, but as physical reaction to awe.The sight of the mold of man was more astonishing than ever. I felt, without anyarrogance, that I had gone through an enormous change since the first time I hadseen it. However, all the things I had seen and learned had only given me agreater, more profound appreciation for the miracle that I had in front of myeyes.The mold of man was superimposed on the bridge at first, then I refocused myeyes and saw that the mold of man extended up and down into infinity; the bridgewas but a meager shell; a tiny sketch superimposed on the eternal.And so were the minute figures of people who moved around me, looking at me withunabashed curiosity. But I was beyond their touch, although at that moment I wasas vulnerable as I could be. The mold of man had no power to protect me or spareme, yet I loved it with a passion that knew no limits.I thought that I understood then something that don Juan had told me repeatedly;that real affection cannot be an investment. I would have gladly remained theservant of the mold of man, not for what it could give me, for it has nothing togive, but for the sheer affection I felt for it.I had the sensation of something pulling me away, and before I disappeared fromits presence I shouted a promise to the mold of man, but a great force whiskedme away before I could finish saying what I meant. I was suddenly kneeling atthe bridge while a group of peasants looked at me and laughed.Don Juan got to my side, helped me up, and walked me back to the house.\"There are two ways of seeing the mold of man,\" don Juan began as soon as we satdown. \"You can see it as a man or you can see it as a light. That depends on theshift of the assemblage point. If the shift is lateral, the mold is a humanbeing. If the shift is in the midsection of man's band, the mold is a light. Theonly value of what you've done today is that your assemblage point shifted inthe midsection.\"He said that the position where one sees the mold of man is very close to thatwhere the dreaming body and the barrier of perception appear. That was thereason the new seers recommend that the mold of man be seen and understood.\"Are you sure you understand what the mold of man really is?\" he asked with asmile.\"I assure you, don Juan, that I'm perfectly aware of what the mold of man is,\" Isaid.\"I heard you shouting inanities to the mold of man when I got to the bridge,\" hesaid with a most malicious smile.I told him that I had felt like a worthless servant worshiping a worthlessmaster, and yet I was moved out of sheer affection to promise undying love.He found it all hilarious and laughed until he was choking.\"The promise of a worthless servant to a worthless master is worthless,\" he saidand choked again with laughter.I did not feel like defending my position. My affection for the mold of man wasoffered freely without thought of recompense. It did not matter to me that mypromise was worthless. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"17. The Journey of the Dreaming BodyDon Juan told me that the two of us were going to drive to the city of Oaxacafor the last time. He made it very clear that we would never be there togetheragain. Perhaps his feeling might return to the place, he said, but never againthe totality of himself.In Oaxaca, don Juan spent hours looking at mundane, trivial things: the fadedcolor of walls, the shape of distant mountains, the pattern on cracked cement,the faces of people. Then we went to the square and sat on his favorite bench,which was unoccupied, as it always was when he wanted it. During our long walk in the city, I had tried my best to work myself into a moodof sadness and moroseness, but I just could not do it. There was somethingfestive about his departure. He explained it as the unrestrainable vigor oftotal freedom.\"Freedom is like a contagious disease,\" he said. \"It is transmitted. Its carrieris an impeccable nagual. People might not appreciate that, and that's becausethey don't want to be free. Freedom is frightening. Remember that. But not forus. I've groomed myself nearly all my life for this moment. And so will you.\"He repeated over and over that at the stage where I was, no rational assumptionsshould interfere with my actions. He said that the dreaming body and the barrierof perception are positions of the assemblage point, and that that knowledge isas vital to seers as knowing how to read and write is to modern man. Both areaccomplishments attained after years of practice.\"It is very important that you remember, right now, the time when yourassemblage point reached that position and it created your dreaming body,\" hesaid with tremendous urgency.Then he smiled and remarked that time was extremely short; he said that therecollection of the main journey of my dreaming body would put my assemblagepoint in a position to break the barrier of perception in order to assembleanother world.\"The dreaming body is known by different names,\" he said after a long pause.\"The name I like the best is, 'the other'. That term belongs to the old seers,together with the mood. I don't particularly care for their mood, but I have toadmit that I like their term; the other. It's mysterious and forbidden. Justlike the old seers, it gives me the feeling of darkness, of shadows. The oldseers said that the other always comes shrouded in wind.\" Over the years don Juan and other members of his party had tried to make meaware that we can be in two places at once; that we can experience a sort ofperceptual dualism.As don Juan spoke, I began to remember something so deeply forgotten that atfirst it was as if I had only heard about it. Then, step by step, I realizedthat I had lived that experience myself.I had been in two places at once. It happened one night in the mountains ofnorthern Mexico. I had been collecting plants with don Juan all day. We hadstopped for the night and I had nearly fallen asleep from fatigue when suddenlythere was a gust of wind and don Genaro sprang up from the darkness right infront of me, and nearly scared me to death.My first thought was one of suspicion. I believed that don Genaro had beenhiding in the bushes all day, waiting for darkness to set in before making histerrifying appearance. As I looked at him prancing around, I noticed that therewas something truly odd about him that night. Something palpable, real, and yetsomething I could not pinpoint.He joked with me and horsed around, performing acts that defied my reason. DonJuan laughed like an idiot at my dismay. When he judged that the time was right,he made me shift into heightened awareness and for a moment I was able to seedon Juan and don Genaro as two blobs of light. Genaro was not theflesh-and-blood don Genaro that I knew in my state of normal awareness but hisdreaming body. I could tell, because I saw him as a ball of fire that was abovethe ground. He was not rooted as don Juan was. It was as if Genaro, the blob oflight, were on the verge of taking off, already up in the air, a couple of feetoff the ground, ready to zoom away.Another thing I had done that night, which suddenly became clear to me as Irecollected the event, was that I had known automatically that I had to move myeyes in order to make my assemblage point shift. I could, with my intent, alignthe emanations that made me see Genaro as a blob of light, or I could align theemanations that made me see him as merely odd, unknown, and strange.When I saw Genaro as odd, his eyes had a malevolent glare, like the eyes of abeast in the darkness. But they were eyes, nonetheless. I did not see them aspoints of amber light.That night don Juan said that Genaro was going to help my assemblage point shiftvery deeply, that I should imitate him and follow everything he did. Genarostuck out his rear end and then thrust his pelvis forward with great force. Ithought it was an obscene gesture. He repeated it over and over again, movingaround as if he were dancing.Don Juan nudged me on the arm, urging me to imitate Genaro, and I did. Both ofus sort of romped around, performing that grotesque movement.After a while, I had the feeling that my body was executing the movement on itsown, without what seemed to be the real me. The separation between my body andthe real me became even more pronounced, and then at a given instant I waslooking at some ludicrous scene where two men were making lewd gestures at eachother.I watched in fascination and realized that I was one of the two men. The momentI became aware of it I felt something pulling me and I found myself againthrusting my pelvis backward and forward in unison with Genaro. Almostimmediately, I noticed that another man standing next to don Juan was watchingus. The wind was blowing around him. I could see his hair being ruffled. He wasnaked and seemed embarrassed. The wind gathered around him as if protecting him,or perhaps the opposite, as if trying to blow him away.I was slow to realize that I was the other man. When I did, I got the shock ofmy life. An imponderable physical force pulled me apart as if I were made out offibers, and I was again looking at a man that was me, romping around withGenaro, gaping at me while I looked.And at the same time, I was looking at a naked man that was me, gaping at mewhile I made lewd gestures with Genaro. The shock was so great that I broke therhythm of my movements and fell down.The next thing I knew, don Juan was helping me to stand up. Genaro and the otherme, the naked one, had disappeared.I had also remembered that don Juan had refused to discuss the event. He did notexplain it except to say that Genaro was an expert in creating his double, orthe other, and that I had had long interactions with Genaro's double in statesof normal awareness without ever detecting it. \"That night, as he has done hundreds of times before, Genaro made yourassemblage point shift very deep into your left side,\" don Juan commented afterI had recounted to him everything I had remembered. \"His power was such that hedragged your assemblage point to the position where the dreaming body appears.You saw your dreaming body watching you. And his dancing did the trick.\"I asked him to explain to me how Genaro's lewd movement could have produced sucha drastic effect.\"You're a prude,\" he said. \"Genaro used your immediate displeasure andembarrassment at having to perform a lewd gesture. Since he was in his dreamingbody, he had the power to see the Eagle's emanations. From that vantage point,it was a cinch to make your assemblage point move.\"He said that whatever Genaro had helped me to do that night was minor; thatGenaro had moved my assemblage point and made it produce a dreaming body many,many times, but that those events were not what he wanted me to remember.\"I want you to realign the proper emanations and remember the time when youreally woke up in a dreaming position,\" he said. A strange surge of energy seemed to explode inside me and I knew what he wantedme to remember. I could not, however, focus my memory on the complete event. Icould only recall a fragment of it.I remembered that one morning, don Juan, don Genaro and I had sat on that verysame bench while I was in a state of normal awareness. Don Genaro had said, allof a sudden, that he was going to make his body leave the bench without gettingup. The statement was completely out of the context of what we had beendiscussing. I was accustomed to don Juan's orderly, didactic words and actions.I turned to don Juan, expecting a clue, but he remained impassive, lookingstraight ahead as if don Genaro and I were not there at all.Don Genaro nudged me to attract my attention, and then I witnessed a mostdisturbing sight. I actually saw Genaro on the other side of the square. He wasbeckoning me to come. But I also saw don Genaro sitting next to me, lookingstraight ahead, just as don Juan was.I wanted to say something, to express my awe, but I found myself dumbstruck,imprisoned by some force around me that did not let me talk. I again looked atGenaro across the park. He was still there, motioning to me with a gesture ofhis head to join him.My emotional distress mounted by the second. My stomach was getting upset, andfinally I had tunnel vision, a tunnel that led directly to Genaro on the otherside of the square. And then a great curiosity, or a great fear, which seemed tobe the same thing at that moment, pulled me to where he was. I actually soaredthrough the air and got to where he was. He made me turn around and pointed tothe three people who were sitting on a bench in a static position as if time hadbeen suspended.I felt a terrible discomfort, an internal itching, as if the soft organs in thecavity of my body were on fire, and then I was back on the bench, but Genaro wasgone. He waved goodbye to me from across the square and disappeared among thepeople going to the market.Don Juan became very animated. He kept on looking at me. He stood up and walkedaround me. He sat down again and could not keep a straight face as he talked tome.I realized why he was acting that way. I had entered into a state of heightenedawareness without being helped by don Juan. Genaro had succeeded in making myassemblage point move by itself.I laughed involuntarily upon seeing my writing pad, which don Juan solemnly putinside his pocket. He said that he was going to use my state of heightenedawareness to show me that there is no end to the mystery of man and to themystery of the world.I focused all my concentration on his words. However, don Juan said something Idid not understand. I asked him to repeat what he had said. He began talkingvery softly. I thought he had lowered his voice so as not to be overheard byother people. I listened carefully, but I could not understand a word of what hewas saying; he was either speaking in a language foreign to me or it was mumbojumbo.The strange part of it was that something had caught my undivided attention,either the rhythm of his voice or the fact that I had forced myself tounderstand. I had the feeling that my mind was different from usual, although Icould not figure out what the difference was. I had a hard time thinking,reasoning out what was taking place.Don Juan talked to me very softly in my ear. He said that since I had enteredinto heightened awareness without any help from him my assemblage point was veryloose, and that I could let it shift into the left side by relaxing, by fallinghalf asleep on that bench. He assured me that he was watching over me, that Ihad nothing to fear. He urged me to relax, to let my assemblage point move.I instantly felt the heaviness of being deeply asleep. At one moment, I becameaware that I was having a dream. I saw a house that I had seen before. I wasapproaching it as if I were walking on the street. There were other houses, butI could not pay any attention to them. Something had fixed my awareness on theparticular house I was seeing. It was a big modern stucco house with a frontlawn.When I got closer to that house, I had a feeling of familiarity with it, as if Ihad dreamed of it before. I walked on a gravel path to the front door. It wasopen and I walked inside. There was a dark hall and a large living room to theright, furnished with a dark-red couch and matching armchairs set in a corner. Iwas definitely having tunnel vision. I could see only what was in front of myeyes.A young woman was standing by the couch as if she had just stood up as I camein. She was lean and tall, exquisitely dressed in a tailored green suit. She wasperhaps in her late twenties. She had dark-brown hair, burning brown eyes thatseemed to smile, and a pointed, finely chiseled nose. Her complexion was fairbut had been tanned to a gorgeous brown. I found her ravishingly beautiful. Sheseemed to be an American. She nodded at me, smiling, and extended her hands withthe palms down as if she were helping me up.I clasped her hands in a most awkward movement. I scared myself and tried toback away, but she held me firmly and yet so gently. Her hands were long andbeautiful. She spoke to me in Spanish with a faint trace of an accent. Shebegged me to relax, to feel her hands, to concentrate my attention on her faceand to follow the movement of her mouth. I wanted to ask her who she was, but Icould not utter a word.Then I heard don Juan's voice in my ear. He said, \"Oh, there you are,\" as if hehad just found me. I was sitting on the park bench with him. But I could alsohear the young woman's voice. She said, \"Come and sit with me.\" I did just thatand began a most incredible shifting of points of view. I was alternately withdon Juan and with that young woman. I could see both of them as clearly asanything.Don Juan asked me if I liked her, if I found her appealing and soothing. I couldnot speak, but somehow I conveyed to him the feeling that I did like that ladyimmensely. I thought, without any overt reason, that she was a paragon ofkindness, that she was indispensable to what don Juan was doing with me.Don Juan spoke in my ear again and said that if I liked her that much I shouldwake up in her house, that my feeling of warmth and affection for her wouldguide me. I felt giggly and reckless. A sensation of overwhelming excitationrippled through my body. I felt as if the excitation were actuallydisintegrating me. I did not care what happened to me. I gladly plunged into ablackness, black beyond words, and then I found myself in the young woman'shouse. I was sitting with her on the couch.After an instant of sheer animal panic, I realized that somehow I was notcomplete. Something was missing in me. I did not, however, find the situationthreatening. The thought crossed my mind that I was dreaming and that I waspresently going to wake up on the park bench in Oaxaca with don Juan where Ireally was; where I really belonged.The young woman helped me to get up and took me to a bathroom where a large tubwas filled with water. I realized then that I was stark naked. She gently mademe get into the tub and held my head up while I half floated in it.After a while she helped me out of the tub. I felt weak and flimsy. I lay downon the living-room couch and she came close to me. I could hear the beating ofher heart and the pressure of blood rushing through her body. Her eyes were liketwo radiant sources of something that was not light, or heat, but curiously inbetween the two. I knew that I was seeing the force of life projecting out ofher body through her eyes. Her whole body was like a live furnace; it glowed.I felt a weird tremor that agitated my whole being. It was as if my nerves wereexposed and someone was plucking them. The sensation was agonizing. Then Ieither fainted or fell asleep.When I woke up, someone was putting face towels soaked in cold water on my faceand the back of my neck. I saw the young woman sitting by my head on the bedwhere I was lying. She had a pail of water on a night table. Don Juan wasstanding at the foot of the bed with my clothes draped over his arm.I was fully awake then. I sat up. They had covered me with a blanket.\"How's the traveler?\" don Juan asked, smiling. \"Are you in one piece now?\"That was all I could remember. I narrated this episode to don Juan, and as Italked, I recalled another fragment. I remembered that don Juan had taunted andteased me about finding me naked in the lady's bed. I had gotten terriblyirritated at his remarks. I had put on my clothes and stomped out of the housein a fury.Don Juan had caught up with me on the front lawn. In a very serious tone he hadremarked that I was my ugly stupid self again, that I had put myself together bybeing embarrassed, which had proved to him that there was still no end to myself-importance.But he had added in a conciliatory tone that that was not important at themoment. What was significant was the fact that I had moved my assemblage pointvery deeply into the left side and consequently I had traveled an enormousdistance.He had spoken of wonders and mysteries, but I had not been able to listen tohim, for I had been caught in the crossfire between fear and self-importance. Iwas actually fuming. I was certain that don Juan had hypnotized me in the parkand had then taken me to that lady's house, and that the two of them had doneterrible things to me.My fury was interrupted. Something out there in the street was so horrifying, soshocking to me, that my anger stopped instantaneously. But before my thoughtsbecame fully rearranged, don Juan hit me on my back and nothing of what had justtaken place remained. I found myself back in my blissful everyday-lifestupidity, happily listening to don Juan, worrying about whether or not he likedme. As I was telling don Juan about the new fragment that I had just remembered Irealized that one of his methods for handling my emotional turmoil was to makeme shift into normal awareness.\"The only thing that soothes those who journey into the unknown is oblivion,\" hesaid. \"What a relief to be in the ordinary world!\"That day, you accomplished a marvelous feat. The sober thing for me to do wasnot to let you focus on it at all. Just as you began to really panic I made youshift into normal awareness. I moved your assemblage point beyond the positionwhere there are no more doubts. There are two such positions for warriors. Inone you have no more doubts because you know everything. In the other, which isnormal awareness, you have no doubts because you don't know anything.\"It was too soon then for you to know what had really happened. But I think theright time to know is now. Looking at that street, you were about to find outwhere your dreaming position had been. You traveled an enormous distance thatday.\"Don Juan scrutinized me with a mixture of glee and sadness. I was trying my bestto keep under control the strange agitation I was feeling. I sensed thatsomething terribly important to me was lost inside my memory, or, as don Juanwould have put it, inside some unused emanations that at one time had beenaligned.My struggle to keep calm proved to be the wrong thing to do. All at once, myknees wobbled and nervous spasms ran through my midsection. I mumbled, unable tovoice a question. I had to swallow hard and breathe deeply before I regained mycalmness.\"When we first sat down here to talk, I said that no rational assumptions shouldinterfere with the actions of a seer,\" he continued in a stern tone. \"I knewthat in order to reclaim what you've done, you'd have to dispense withrationality, but you'd have to do it in the level of awareness you are in now.\"He explained that I had to understand that rationality is a condition ofalignment, merely the result of the position of the assemblage point. Heemphasized that I had to understand this when I was in a state of greatvulnerability, as I was at that moment.To understand it when my assemblage point had reached the position where thereare no doubts was useless, because realizations of that nature are commonplacein that position.It was equally useless to understand it in a state of normal awareness becausein that state such realizations are emotional outbursts that are valid only foras long as the emotion lasts.\"I've said that you traveled a great distance that day,\" he said calmly. \"And Isaid that because I know it. I was there, remember?\"I was sweating profusely out of nervousness and anxiety.\"You traveled because you woke up at a distant dreaming position,\" he continued.\"When Genaro pulled you across the plaza, right here from this bench, he pavedthe way for your assemblage point to move from normal awareness all the way tothe position where the dreaming body appears.\"Your dreaming body actually flew over an incredible distance in the blink of aneyelid. Yet that's not the important part. The mystery is in the dreamingposition. If it is strong enough to pull you, you can go to the ends of thisworld or beyond it, just as the old seers did. They disappeared from this worldbecause they woke up at a dreaming position beyond the limits of the known. Yourdreaming position that day was in this world, but quite a distance from the cityof Oaxaca.\"\"How does a journey like that take place?\" I asked.\"There is no way of knowing how it is done,\" he said. \"Strong emotion, orunbending intent, or great interest serves as a guide. Then the assemblage pointgets powerfully fixed at the dreaming position, long enough to drag there allthe emanations that are inside the cocoon.\"Don Juan said then that he had made me 'see' countless times over the years ofour association, either in states of normal awareness or in states of heightenedawareness. I had seen countless things that I was now beginning to understand ina more coherent fashion.This coherence was not logical or rational, but it clarified, nonetheless, inwhatever strange way everything I had done, everything that was done to me, andeverything I had seen in all those years with him.He said that now I needed to have one last clarification: the coherent butirrational realization that everything in the world we have learned to perceiveis inextricably tied to the position where the assemblage point is located; andif the assemblage point is displaced from that position, the world will cease tobe what it is to us.Don Juan stated that a displacement of the assemblage point beyond the midlineof the cocoon of man makes the entire world we know vanish from our view in oneinstant, as if it had been erased.The stability and the substantiality that seems to belong to our perceivableworld is just the force of alignment. Certain emanations are routinely alignedbecause of the fixation of the assemblage point on one specific spot. That isall there is to our world.\"The soundness of the world is not the mirage,\" he continued, \"the mirage is thefixation of the assemblage point on any spot. When seers shift their assemblagepoints, they are not confronted with an illusion, they are confronted withanother world. That new world is as real as the one we are watching now, but thenew fixation of their assemblage points which produces that new world is as muchof a mirage as the old fixation.\"Take yourself, for example. You are now in a state of heightened awareness.Whatever you are capable of doing in such a state is not an illusion. It is asreal as the world you will face tomorrow in your daily life, and yet tomorrowthe world you are witnessing now won't exist. It exists only when yourassemblage point moves to the particular spot where you are now.\"He added that the task warriors are faced with, after they finish theirtraining, is one of integration. In the course of training, warriors, especiallynagual men, are made to shift to as many individual spots as possible. He saidthat in my case I had moved to countless positions that I would have tointegrate someday into a coherent whole.\"For instance, if you would shift your assemblage point to a specific position,you'd remember who that lady is,\" he continued with a strange smile. \"Yourassemblage point has been at that spot hundreds of times. It should be theeasiest thing for you to integrate it.\"As though my recollection depended on his suggestion, I began to have vaguememories; feelings of sorts. There was a feeling of boundless affection thatseemed to attract me. A most pleasant sweetness filled the air, exactly as ifsomeone had just come up from behind me and poured that scent over me. I eventurned around.And then I remembered. She was Carol, the nagual woman. I had been with her onlythe day before. How could I have forgotten her?I had an indescribable moment in which I think all the feelings of mypsychological repertory ran through my mind. Was it possible, I asked myself,that I had woken up in her house in Tucson, Arizona, two thousand miles away?And are each of the instances of heightened awareness so isolated that onecannot remember them?Don Juan came to my side and put his arm on my shoulder. He said that he knewexactly how I felt. His benefactor had made him go through a similar experience.And what he himself was now trying to do with me, his benefactor had tried to dowith him: soothe with words. He had appreciated his benefactor's attempt, but hedoubted then, as he doubted now, that there is a way to soothe anyone whorealizes the journey of the dreaming body.There was no doubt in my mind now. Something in me had traveled the distancebetween the cities of Oaxaca, Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona. I felt a strangerelief, as if I had been purged of guilt at long last.During the years I had spent with don Juan, I had had lapses of continuity in mymemory. My being in Tucson with him on that day was one of those lapses. Iremembered not being able to recall how I had gotten to Tucson.I did not pay any attention to it, however. I thought the lapse was the resultof my activities with don Juan. He was always very careful not to arouse myrational suspicions in states of normal awareness, but if suspicions wereunavoidable he always curtly explained them away by suggesting that the natureof our activities fostered serious disparities of memory.I told don Juan that since both of us had ended up that day in the same place, Iwondered whether it was possible for two or more people to wake up at the samedreaming position.\"Of course,\" he said. \"That's the way the old Toltec sorcerers took off into theunknown in packs. They followed one another. There is no way of knowing how onefollows someone else. It's just done. The dreaming body just does it. Thepresence of another dreamer spurs it to do it. That day you pulled me with you.And I followed because I wanted to be with you.\"I had so many questions to ask him, but every one of them seemed superfluous.\"How is it possible that I didn't remember the nagual woman?\" I muttered, and ahorrible anguish and longing gripped me. I was trying not to feel sad anymore,but suddenly sadness ripped through me like pain.\"You still don't remember her,\" he said. \"Only when your assemblage point shiftscan you recollect her. She is like a phantom to you, and so are you to her.You've seen her once while you were in normal awareness, but she's never seenyou in her normal awareness. To her you are as much a personage as she is toyou. With the difference that you may wake up someday and integrate it all. Youmay have enough time to do that, but she won't. Her time here is short.\"I felt like protesting a terrible injustice. I mentally prepared a barrage ofobjections, but I never voiced them. Don Juan's smile was beaming. His eyesshone with sheer glee and mischief. I had the sensation that he was waiting formy statements, because he knew what I was going to say. And that sensationstopped me, or rather I did not say anything because my assemblage point hadagain moved by itself. And I knew then that the nagual woman could not be pitiedfor not having time, nor could I rejoice for having it.Don Juan was reading me like a book. He urged me to finish my realization andvoice the reason for not feeling sorry or for not rejoicing. I felt for aninstant that I knew why. But then I lost the thread.\"The excitation of having time is equal to the excitation of not having it,\" hesaid. \"It's all the same.\"\"To feel sad is not the same as feeling sorry \" I said. \"And I feel terriblysad.\"\"Who cares about sadness?\" he said. \"Think only of the mysteries. Mystery is allthat matters. We are living beings. We have to die and relinquish our awareness.But if we could change just a tinge of that, what mysteries must await us! Whatmysteries!\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"18. Breaking the Barrier of PerceptionIn the late afternoon, still in Oaxaca, don Juan and I strolled around thesquare leisurely. As we approached his favorite bench the people who weresitting there got up and left. We hurried over to it and sat down.\"We've come to the end of my explanation of awareness,\" he said. \"And today, youare going to assemble another world by yourself and leave all doubts asideforever.\"There must be no mistake about what you are going to do. Today, from thevantage point of heightened awareness, you are going to make your assemblagepoint move and in one instant you are going to align the emanations of anotherworld.\"In a few days, when Genaro and I meet you on a mountaintop, you are going to dothe same from the disadvantage of normal awareness. You will have to align theemanations of another world on a moment's notice. If you don't you will die thedeath of an average man who falls from a precipice.\"He was alluding to an act that he would have me perform as the last of histeachings for the right side; the act of jumping from a mountaintop into anabyss.Don Juan stated that warriors ended their training when they were capable ofbreaking the barrier of perception, unaided, starting from a normal state ofawareness. The nagual led warriors to that threshold, but success was up to theindividual. The nagual merely tested them by continually pushing them to fendfor themselves.\"The only force that can temporarily cancel out alignment is alignment,\" hecontinued. \"You will have to cancel the alignment that keeps you perceiving theworld of daily affairs. By intending a new position for your assemblage point,and by intending to keep it fixed there long enough, you will assemble anotherworld and escape this one.\"The old seers are still defying death, to this day, by doing just that,intending their assemblage points to remain fixed on positions that place themin any of the seven worlds.\"\"What will happen if I succeed in aligning another world?\" I asked.\"You will go to it,\" he replied. \"As Genaro did, one night in this very placewhen he was showing you the mystery of alignment.\"\"Where will I be, don Juan?\"\"In another world, of course. Where else?\"\"What about the people around me, and the buildings, and the mountains, andeverything else?\"\"You'll be separated from all that by the very barrier that you have broken; thebarrier of perception. And just like the seers who have buried themselves todefy death, you won't be in this world.\"There was a battle raging inside me as I heard his statements. Some part of meclamored that don Juan's position was untenable, while another part knew beyondany question that he was right.I asked him what would happen if I moved my assemblage point while I was in thestreet, in the middle of traffic in Los Angeles.\"Los Angeles will vanish, like a puff of air,\" he replied with a seriousexpression. \"But you will remain.\"That is the mystery I've been trying to explain to you. You've experienced it,but you haven't understood it yet, and today you will.\"He said that I could not as yet use the boost of the earth to shift into anothergreat band of emanations, but that since I had an imperative need to shift, thatneed was going to serve me as a launcher.Don Juan looked up at the sky. He stretched his arms above his head as if he hadbeen sitting for too long and was pushing physical weariness out of his body. Hecommanded me to turn off my internal dialogue and enter into inner silence. Thenhe stood up and began to walk away from the square. He signaled me to followhim. He took a deserted side street. I recognized it as being the same streetwhere Genaro had given me his demonstration of alignment. The moment Irecollected that, I found myself walking with don Juan in a place that by thenwas very familiar to me; a deserted plain with yellow dunes of what seemed to besulfur.I recalled then that don Juan had made me perceive that world hundreds of times.I also recalled that beyond the desolate landscape of the dunes there wasanother world shining with an exquisite, uniform, pure white light.When don Juan and I entered into it this time, I sensed that the light, whichcame from every direction, was not an invigorating light, but was so soothingthat it gave me the feeling that it was sacred.As that sacred light bathed me a rational thought exploded in my inner silence.I thought it was quite possible that mystics and saints had made this journey ofthe assemblage point. They had seen God in the mold of man. They had seen hellin the sulfur dunes. And then they had seen the glory of heaven in thediaphanous light.My rational thought burned out almost immediately under the onslaughts of what Iwas perceiving. My awareness was taken by a multitude of shapes, figures of men,women, and children of all ages, and other incomprehensible apparitions gleamingwith a blinding white light.I saw don Juan, walking by my side, staring at me and not at the apparitions,but the next instant I saw him as a ball of luminosity, bobbing up and down afew feet away from me. The ball made an abrupt and frightening movement and camecloser to me and I saw inside it.Don Juan was working his glow of awareness for my benefit. The glow suddenlyshone on four or five threadlike filaments on his left side. It remained fixedthere. All my concentration was on it. Something pulled me slowly as if througha tube and I saw the allies- three dark, long, rigid figures agitated by atremor, like leaves in a breeze. They were against an almost fluorescent pinkbackground. The moment I focused my eyes on them, they came to where I was, notwalking or gliding or flying, but by pulling themselves along some fibers ofwhiteness that came out of me. The whiteness was not a light or a glow but linesthat seemed to be drawn with heavy powder chalk. They disintegrated quickly, yetnot quickly enough. The allies were on me before the lines faded away.They crowded me. I became annoyed, and the allies immediately moved away as if Ihad chastised them. I felt sorry for them, and my feeling pulled them backinstantly. And they again came and rubbed themselves against me. I saw thensomething I had seen in the mirror at the stream. The allies had no inner glow.They had no inner mobility. There was no life in them. And yet they wereobviously alive. They were strange grotesque shapes that resembled zippered-upsleeping bags. The thin line in the middle of their elongated shapes made themlook as if they had been sewed up.They were not pleasing figures. The sensation that they were totally alien to memade me feel uncomfortable, impatient. I saw that the three allies were movingas if they were jumping up and down. There was a faint glow inside them. Theglow grew in intensity until, in at least one of the allies, it was quitebrilliant.The instant I saw that, I was facing a black world. I do not mean that it wasdark as night is dark. It was rather that everything around me was pitch-black.I looked up at the sky and I could not find light anywhere. The sky was alsoblack and literally covered with lines and irregular circles of various degreesof blackness. The sky looked like a black piece of wood where the grain showedin relief.I looked down at the ground. It was fluffy. It seemed to be made of flakes ofagar-agar; they were not dull flakes, but they were not shiny either. It wassomething in between which I had never seen in my life; black agar-agar.I heard then the voice of seeing. It said that my assemblage point had assembleda total world with other great bands of emanations; a black world.I wanted to absorb every word I was hearing. In order to do that I had to splitmy concentration. The voice stopped. My eyes became focused again. I wasstanding with don Juan just a few blocks away from the square.I instantly felt that I had no time to rest, that it would be useless to indulgein being shocked. I rallied all my strength and asked don Juan if I had donewhat he had expected.\"You did exactly what you were expected to do,\" he said reassuringly. \"Let's goback to the square and stroll around it one more time; for the last time in thisworld.\"I refused to think about don Juan's leaving, so I asked him about the blackworld. I had vague recollections of having seen it before.\"It's the easiest world to assemble,\" he said. \"And of all you've experienced,only the black world is worth considering. It is the only true alignment ofanother great band you have ever made. Everything else has been a lateral shiftalong man's band, but still within the same great band. The wall of fog, theplain with yellow dunes, the world of the apparitions- all are lateralalignments that our assemblage points make as they approach a crucial position.\"He explained as we walked back to the square that one of the strange qualitiesof the black world is that it does not have the same emanations that account fortime in our world. They are different emanations that produce a differentresult. Seers that journey into the black world feel that they have been in itfor an eternity, but in our world that turns out to be an instant.\"The black world is a dreadful world because it ages the body,\" he saidemphatically.I asked him to clarify his statements. He slowed down his pace and looked at me.He reminded me that Genaro, in his direct way, had tried to point that out to meonce, when he told me that we had plodded in hell for an eternity while not evena minute had passed in the world we know.Don Juan remarked that in his youth he had become obsessed with the black world.He had wondered, in front of his benefactor, about what would happen to him ifhe went into it and stayed there for a while. But as his benefactor was notgiven to explanations, he had simply plunged don Juan into the black world tolet him find out for himself.\"The nagual Julian's power was so extraordinary,\" don Juan continued, \"that ittook me days to come back from that black world.\"\"You mean it took you days to return your assemblage point to its normalposition, don't you?\" I asked.\"Yes. I mean that,\" he said.He explained that in the few days that he was lost in the black world he aged atleast ten years, if not more. The emanations inside his cocoon felt the strainof years of solitary struggle.Silvio Manuel was a totally different case. The nagual Julian also plunged himinto the unknown, but Silvio Manuel assembled another world with another set ofbands, a world also without the emanations of time but one which has theopposite effect on seers. He disappeared for seven years and yet he felt he hadbeen gone only a moment.\"To assemble other worlds is not only a matter of practice, but a matter ofintent,\" he continued. \"And it isn't merely an exercise of bouncing out of thoseworlds, like being pulled by a rubber band. You see, a seer has to be daring.Once you break the barrier of perception, you don't have to come back to thesame place in the world. See what I mean?\"It slowly dawned on me what he was saying. I had an almost invincible desire tolaugh at such a preposterous idea, but before the idea coalesced into acertainty, don Juan spoke to me and disrupted what I was about to remember.He said that for warriors the danger of assembling other worlds is that thoseworlds are as possessive as our world. The force of alignment is such that oncethe assemblage point breaks away from its normal position, it becomes fixed atother positions, by other alignments. And warriors run the risk of gettingstranded in inconceivable aloneness.The inquisitive, rational part of me commented that I had seen him in the blackworld as a ball of luminosity. It was possible, therefore, to be in that worldwith people.\"Only if people follow you around by moving their own assemblage points when youmove yours,\" he replied. \"I shifted mine in order to be with you. Otherwise youwould have been there alone with the allies.\"We stopped walking, and don Juan said that it was time for me to go.\"I want you to bypass all lateral shifts,\" he said, \"and go directly to the nexttotal world; the black world. In a couple of days you'll have to do the samething by yourself. You won't have time to piddle around. You'll have to do it inorder to escape death.\"He said that breaking the barrier of perception is the culmination of everythingseers do. From the moment that barrier is broken, man and his fate take on adifferent meaning for warriors. Because of the transcendental importance ofbreaking that barrier, the new seers use the act of breaking it as a final test.The test consists of jumping from a mountaintop into an abyss while in a stateof normal awareness. If the warrior jumping into the abyss does not erase thedaily world and assemble another one before he reaches bottom, he dies.\"What you are going to do is to make this world vanish,\" he went on, \"but youare going to remain somewhat yourself. This is the ultimate bastion ofawareness, the one the new seers count on.\"They know that after they burn with consciousness, they somewhat retain thesense of being themselves.\"He smiled and pointed to a street that we could see from where we were standing;the street where Genaro had shown me the mysteries of alignment.\"That street, like any other, leads to eternity,\" he said. \"All you have to dois follow it in total silence. It's time. Go now! Go!\"He turned around and walked away from me. Genaro was waiting for him at thecorner. Genaro waved at me and then made a gesture of urging me to come on. DonJuan kept on walking without turning to look. Genaro joined him. I started tofollow them, but I knew that it was wrong.Instead, I went in the opposite direction. The street was dark, lonely, andbleak. I did not indulge in feelings of failure or inadequacy. I walked in innersilence. My assemblage point was moving at great speed. I saw the three allies.The line of their middle made them look as if they were smiling sideways. I feltthat I was being frivolous. And then a windlike force blew the world away. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"EpilogueA couple of days later, all the nagual's party and all the apprentices gottogether on the flat mountaintop don Juan had told me about.Don Juan said that each of the apprentices had already said goodbye toeverybody, and that all of us were in a state of awareness that admitted nosentimentalism. For us, he said, there was only action. We were warriors in astate of total war.Everyone, with the exception of don Juan, Genaro, Pablito, Nestor, and me, moveda short distance away from the flat mountaintop in order to allow Pablito,Nestor, and me privacy to enter into a state of normal awareness.But before we did, don Juan took us by the arms and walked us around the flattop.\"In a moment, you're going to intend the movement of your assemblage points,\" hesaid. \"And no one will help you. You are now alone. You must remember then thatintent begins with a command.\"The old seers used to say that if warriors are going to have an internaldialogue, they should have the proper dialogue. For the old seers that meant adialogue about sorcery and the enhancement of their self-reflection. For the newseers, it doesn't mean dialogue, but the detached manipulation of intent throughsober commands.\"He said over and over again that the manipulation of intent begins with acommand given to oneself. The command is then repeated until it becomes theEagle's command, and then the assemblage point shifts accordingly the momentwarriors reach inner silence.The fact that such a maneuver is possible, he said, is something of the mostsingular importance to seers, old and new alike, but for reasons diametricallyopposed.Knowing about it allowed the old seers to move their assemblage point toinconceivable dreaming positions in the incommensurable unknown.For the new seers it means refusing to be food. It means escaping the Eagle bymoving their assemblage points to a particular dreaming position called totalfreedom.He explained that the old seers discovered that it is possible to move theassemblage point to the limit of the known and keep it fixed there in a state ofprime heightened awareness. From that position, they saw the feasibility ofslowly shifting their assemblage points permanently to other positions beyondthat limit; a stupendous feat fraught with daring, but lacking sobriety becausethey could never retract the movement of their assemblage points; or perhapsthey never wanted to.Don Juan said that adventurous men faced with the choice of dying in the worldof ordinary affairs or dying in unknown worlds, will unavoidably choose thelatter.But the new seers, realizing that their predecessors had chosen merely to changethe locale of their death, came to understand the futility of it all; thefutility of struggling to control their fellow men; the futility of assemblingother worlds; and above all, the futility of self-importance.One of the most fortunate decisions that the new seers made, he said, was neverto allow their assemblage points to move permanently to any position other thanheightened awareness. From that position, they actually resolved their dilemmaof futility and found out that the solution is not simply to choose an alternateworld in which to die, but to choose total consciousness; total freedom.Don Juan commented that by choosing total freedom, the new seers unwittinglycontinued in the tradition of their predecessors, and became the quintessence ofthe death defiers.He explained that the new seers discovered that if the assemblage point is madeto shift constantly to the confines of the unknown, but is made to return to aposition at the limit of the known, then when it is suddenly released it moveslike lightning across the entire cocoon of man; aligning all the emanationsinside the cocoon at once.\"The new seers burn with the force of alignment,\" don Juan went on, \"with theforce of will, which they have turned into the force of intent through a life ofimpeccability. Intent is the alignment of all the amber emanations of awareness,so it is correct to say that total freedom means total awareness.\"\"Is that what all of you are going to do, don Juan?\" I asked.\"We most certainly will,\" he replied, \"if we have sufficient energy. Freedom isthe Eagle's gift to man. Unfortunately, very few men understand that all we needin order to accept such a magnificent gift is to have sufficient energy.\"If that's all we need, then, by all means, we must become misers of energy.\"After that, don Juan made us enter into a state of normal awareness. At dusk,Pablito, Nestor, and I jumped into the abyss. And don Juan and the nagual'sparty burned with the fire from within. They entered into total awareness: Theyhad sufficient energy to accept the mind-boggling gift of freedom.Pablito, Nestor, and I didn't die at the bottom of that gorge. Neither had theother apprentices who had jumped at an earlier time. We never reached thebottom. All of us, under the impact of such a tremendous and incomprehensibleact as jumping to our deaths, moved our assemblage points and assembled otherworlds.We know now that we were left to remember heightened awareness and therebyregain the totality of ourselves. And the more we remember, the more intense is our elation and our wondering...But also the greater our doubts and our turmoil.As yet, it is as if we were left only to be tantalized by the most far reachingquestions about the nature and the fate of man......until the time when we may have sufficient energy, not only to verifyeverything don Juan taught us, but also to accept the Eagle's gift ourselves. ### \"The Fire From Within\" - Copyright 1984 by Carlos Castaneda - The End ###"}]
