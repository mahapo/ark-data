It was the autumn of 1971. I had thecertainty that he was at don Genaro's house in central Mexico and I made thenecessary preparations for a six- or seven-day drive to visit him. On the secondday of my journey, however, on an impulse, I stopped at don Juan's place inSonora in the midafternoon. I parked my car, and walked a short distance to thehouse. To my surprise, I found him there.\"Don Juan! I didn't expect to find you here,\" I said.He laughed. My surprise seemed to delight him. He was sitting on an empty milkcrate by the front door. He appeared to have been waiting for me. There was anair of accomplishment in the ease with which he greeted me. He took off his hat,and flourished it in a comical gesture. Then he put it on again, and gave me amilitary salute. He was leaning against the wall, sitting on the crate as if itwere a saddle.\"Sit down, sit down,\" he said in a jovial tone. \"Good to see you again.\"\"I was going to go all the way to central Mexico for nothing,\" I said. \"And thenI would've had to drive back to Los Angeles. Finding you here has saved me daysand days of driving.\"\"Somehow you would've found me,\" he said in a mysterious tone, \"but let's saythat you owe me the six days that you would've needed to get there; days whichyou should use in doing something more interesting than pressing down on the gaspedal of your car.\"There was something engaging in don Juan's smile. His warmth was contagious.\"Where's your writing gear?\" he asked.I told him that I had left it in the car. He said that I looked unnaturalwithout it, and made me go back and get it.\"I have finished writing a book,\" I said.He gave me a long, strange look that produced an itching in the pit of mystomach. It was as if he were pushing my middle section with a soft object. Ifelt like I was going to get ill, but then he turned his head to the side and Iregained my original feeling of well-being.I wanted to talk about my book but he made a gesture that indicated that he didnot want me to say anything about it. He smiled. His mood was light andcharming, and he immediately engaged me in a casual conversation about peopleand current events. Finally I managed to steer the conversation onto the topic of my interest. Ibegan by mentioning that I had reviewed my early notes, and had realized that hehad been giving me a detailed description of the sorcerers' world from thebeginning of our association. In light of what he had said to me in thosestages, I had begun to question the role of hallucinogenic plants.\"Why did you make me take those power plants so many times?\" I asked.He laughed, and mumbled very softly, \"Cause you're dumb.\"I heard him the first time but I wanted to make sure, and pretended I had notunderstood.\"I beg your pardon?\" I asked.\"You know what I said,\" he replied and stood up.He tapped me on the head as he walked by me.\"You're rather slow,\" he said. \"And there was no other way to jolt you.\"\"So none of that was absolutely necessary?\" I asked.\"It was in your case. There are other types of people, however, that do not seemto need them.\"He stood next to me, staring at the top of the bushes by the left side of hishouse. Then he sat down again, and talked about Eligio, his other apprentice. Hesaid that Eligio had taken psychotropic plants only once since he became hisapprentice, and yet he was perhaps even more advanced than I was.\"To be sensitive is a natural condition of certain people,\" he said. \"You arenot. But neither am I. In the final analysis sensitivity matters very little.\"\"What's the thing that matters then?\" I asked.He seemed to search for an appropriate answer.\"What matters is that a warrior be impeccable,\" he finally said. \"But that'sonly a way of talking; a way of beating around the bush. You have alreadyaccomplished some tasks of sorcery and I believe this is the time to mention thesource of everything that matters. So I will say that what matters to a warrioris arriving at the totality of oneself.\"\"What is the totality of oneself, don Juan?\"\"I said that I was only going to mention it. There are still a lot of loose endsin your life that you must tie together before we can talk about the totality ofoneself.\"He ended our conversation there. He made a gesture with his hands to signal thathe wanted me to stop talking. Apparently there was something or somebody nearby.He tilted his head to the left, as if to listen. I could see the whites of hiseyes as he focused on the bushes beyond the house to his left. He listenedattentively for a few moments and then stood up. He came to me and whispered inmy ear that we had to leave the house and go for a walk.\"Is there something wrong?\" I asked, also in a whisper.\"No. Nothing is wrong,\" he said. \"Everything is rather right.\" He led me into the desert chaparral. We walked for perhaps half an hour, andthen came to a small circular area free from vegetation; a spot about twelvefeet in diameter where the reddish dirt was packed and perfectly flat. Therewere no signs, however, that machinery had cleared and flattened the area. DonJuan sat down in the center of it, facing the southeast. He pointed to a placeabout five feet away from him and asked me to sit there, facing him.\"What are we going to do here?\" I asked.\"We have an appointment here tonight,\" he replied.He scanned the surroundings with a quick glance, turning around on his seatuntil he was again facing the southeast.His movements had alarmed me. I asked him who we had the appointment with.\"With knowledge,\" he said. \"Let's say that knowledge is prowling around here.\"He did not let me hook on to that cryptic answer. He quickly changed thesubject. In a jovial tone he urged me to be natural; that is to take notes, andtalk as we would have done at his house.What was most pressing on my mind at that time was the vivid sensation I had hadsix months before of 'talking' to a coyote. That event meant to me that for thefirst time I had been capable of visualizing, or apprehending through my senses,and in sober consciousness, the sorcerers' description of the world; adescription in which communicating with animals through speech was a matter ofcourse.\"We're not going to engage ourselves in dwelling on any experience of thatnature,\" don Juan said upon hearing my question. \"It is not advisable for you toindulge in focusing your attention on past events. We may touch on them, butonly in reference.\"\"Why is that so, don Juan?\"\"You don't have enough personal power yet to seek the sorcerers' explanation.\"\"Then there is a sorcerers' explanation!\"\"Certainly. Sorcerers are men. We're creatures of thought. We seekclarifications.\"\"I was under the impression that my great flaw was to seek explanations.\"\"No. Your flaw is to seek convenient explanations; explanations that fit you andyour world. What I object to is your reasonableness. A sorcerer explains thingsin his world too, but he's not as stiff as you.\"\"How can I arrive at the sorcerers' explanation?\"\"By accumulating personal power. Personal power will make you slide with greatease into the sorcerers' explanation. The explanation is not what you would callan explanation. Nevertheless, it makes the world and its mysteries, if notclear, at least less awesome. That should be the essence of an explanation. Butthat is not what you seek. You're after the reflection of your ideas.\"I lost my momentum to ask questions. But his smile urged me to keep on talking.Another issue of great importance to me was his friend don Genaro and theextraordinary effect that his actions had had on me. Every time I had come intocontact with him, I had experienced the most outlandish sensory distortions.Don Juan laughed when I voiced my question.\"Genaro is stupendous,\" he said. \"But for the time being, there is no sense intalking about him or about what he does to you. Again, you don't have enoughpersonal power to unravel that topic. Wait until you have it, then we willtalk.\"\"What if I never have it?\"\"If you never have it, we'll never talk.\"\"At the rate I'm going, will I ever have enough of it?\" I asked.\"That's up to you,\" he replied. \"I have given you all the information necessary.Now it's your responsibility to gain enough personal power to tip the scales.\"\"You're talking in metaphors,\" I said. \"Give it to me straight. Tell me exactlywhat I should do. If you have already told me, let's say that I've forgottenit.\"Don Juan chuckled and lay down, putting his arms behind his head.\"You know exactly what you need,\" he said.I told him that sometimes I thought I knew, hut that most of the time I had noself-confidence.\"I'm afraid that you are confusing issues,\" he said. \"The self-confidence of thewarrior is not the self-confidence of the average man. The average man seekscertainty in the eyes of the onlooker and calls that self-confidence. Thewarrior seeks impeccability in his own eyes and calls that humbleness. Theaverage man is hooked to his fellow men, while the warrior is hooked only tohimself.\"Perhaps you are chasing rainbows. You're after the self-confidence of theaverage man, when you should be after the humbleness of a warrior. Thedifference between the two is remarkable. Self-confidence entails knowingsomething for sure; humbleness entails being impeccable in one's actions andfeelings.\"\"I've been trying to live in accordance with your suggestions,\" I said. \"I maynot be the best, but I'm the best of myself. Is that impeccability?\"\"No. You must do better than that. You must push yourself beyond your limits,all the time.\"\"But that would be insane, don Juan. No one can do that.\"\"There are lots of things that you do now which would have seemed insane to youten years ago. Those things themselves did not change, but your idea of yourselfchanged. What was impossible before is perfectly possible now, and perhaps yourtotal success in changing yourself is only a matter of time.\"In this affair, the only possible course that a warrior has is to actconsistently and without reservations. You know enough of the warrior's way toact accordingly, but your old habits and routines stand in your way.\"I understood what he meant.\"Do you think that writing is one of the old habits I should change?\" I asked.\"Should I destroy my new manuscript?\"He did not answer. He stood up, and turned to look at the edge of the chaparral.I told him that I had received letters from various people telling me that itwas wrong to write about my apprenticeship. They had cited as a precedent thatthe masters of Eastern esoteric doctrines demanded absolute secrecy about theirteachings.\"Perhaps those masters are just indulging in being masters,\" don Juan saidwithout looking at me. \"I'm not a master. I'm only a warrior, so I really don'tknow what a master feels like.\"\"But maybe I'm revealing things I shouldn't, don Juan.\"\"It doesn't matter what one reveals or what one keeps to oneself,\" he said.\"Everything we do, everything we are, rests on our personal power. If we haveenough of it, one word uttered to us might be sufficient to change the course ofour lives. But if we don't have enough personal power, the most magnificentpiece of wisdom can be revealed to us and that revelation won't make a damn bitof difference.\"He then lowered his voice as if he were disclosing a confidential matter to me.\"I'm going to utter perhaps the greatest piece of knowledge anyone can voice,\"he said. \"Let me see what you can do with it.\"Do you know that at this very moment you are surrounded by eternity? And do youknow that you can use that eternity, if you so desire?\"After a long pause, during which he urged me with a subtle movement of his eyesto make a statement, I said that I did not understand what he was talking about.\"There! Eternity is there!\" he said, pointing to the horizon.Then he pointed to the zenith. \"Or there, or perhaps we can say that eternity islike this.\" He extended both arms to point to the east and west.We looked at each other. His eyes held a question.\"What do you say to that?\" he asked, coaxing me to ponder upon his words.I did not know what to say.\"Do you know that you can extend yourself forever in any of the directions Ihave pointed to?\" he went on. \"Do you know that one moment can be eternity? Thisis not a riddle; it's a fact, but only if you mount that moment and use it totake the totality of yourself forever in any direction.\"He stared at me.\"You didn't have this knowledge before,\" he said, smiling. \"Now you do. I haverevealed it to you. But it doesn't make a bit of difference because you don'thave enough personal power to utilize my revelation.\"Yet if you did have enough power, my words alone would serve as the means foryou to round up the totality of yourself, and get the crucial part of it out ofthe boundaries in which it is contained.\"He came to my side and poked my chest with his fingers. It was a very light tap.\"These are the boundaries I'm talking about,\" he said. \"One can get out of them.We are a feeling; an awareness encased here.\"He slapped my shoulders with both hands. My pad and pencil fell to the ground.Don Juan put his foot on the pad and stared at me, and then laughed.I asked him if he minded my taking notes. He said no in a reassuring tone andmoved his foot away.\"We are luminous beings,\" he said, shaking his head rhythmically. \"And for aluminous being only personal power matters. But if you ask me what personalpower is, I have to tell you that my explanation will not explain it.\"Don Juan looked at the western horizon and said that there were still a fewhours of daylight left.\"We have to be here for a long time,\" he explained. \"So, we either sit quietlyor we talk. It is not natural for you to be silent, so let's keep on talking.This spot is a power place and it must become used to us before nightfall. Youmust sit here as naturally as possible without fear or impatience. It seems thatthe easiest way for you to relax is to take notes, so write to your heart'scontent. \"And now, suppose you tell me about your dreaming.\"His sudden shift caught me unprepared. He repeated his request. There was agreat deal to say about it. Dreaming entailed cultivating a peculiar controlover one's dreams to the extent that the experiences undergone in them and thoselived in one's waking hours acquired the same pragmatic [* pragmatic- guided bypractical experience and observation rather than theory] valence. The sorcerers'allegation was that under the impact of dreaming, the ordinary criteria [*criteria- reference points against which other things can be evaluated] todifferentiate a dream from reality become inoperative.Don Juan's praxis [* praxis- translating an idea into action] of dreaming was anexercise that consisted of finding one's hands in a dream. In other words, onehad to deliberately dream that one was looking for and could find one's hands ina dream by simply dreaming that one lifted one's hands to the level of the eyes.After years of unsuccessful attempts, I had finally accomplished the task.Looking at it in retrospect, it had become evident to me that I had succeededonly after I had gained a degree of control over the world of my everyday life.Don Juan wanted to know the salient points. I began telling him that thedifficulty of setting up the command to look at my hands seemed to be, quiteoften, insurmountable. He had warned me that the early stage of the preparatoryfacet, which he called 'setting up dreaming', consisted of a deadly game thatone's mind played with itself; and that some part of myself was going to doeverything it could to prevent the fulfillment of my task. That could include,don Juan had said, plunging me into a loss of meaning, melancholy, or even asuicidal depression.I did not go that far, however. My experience was rather on the light, comicalside. Nonetheless, the result was equally frustrating. Every time I was about tolook at my hands in a dream something extraordinary would happen. I would beginto fly; or my dream would turn into a nightmare; or it would simply become avery pleasant experience of bodily excitation. Everything in the dream wouldextend far beyond the 'normal' in matters of vividness, and therefore beterribly absorbing. My original intention of observing my hands was alwaysforgotten in light of the new situation.One night, quite unexpectedly, I found my hands in my dreams. I dreamt that Iwas walking on an unknown street in a foreign city, and suddenly I lifted up myhands and placed them in front of my face. It was as if something within myselfhad given up, and had permitted me to watch the backs of my hands.Don Juan's instructions had been that as soon as the sight of my hands wouldbegin to dissolve or change into something else, I had to shift my view from myhands to any other element in the surroundings of my dream. In that particulardream I shifted my view to a building at the end of the street. When the sightof the building began to dissipate I focused my attention on the other elementsof the surroundings in my dream. The end result was an incredibly clearcomposite picture of a deserted street in some unknown foreign city.Don Juan made me continue with my account of other experiences in dreaming. Wetalked for a long time. At the end of my report Don Juan stood up and went to the bushes. I also stoodup. I was nervous. It was an unwarranted sensation since there was nothingprecipitating fear or concern. Don Juan returned shortly. He noticed myagitation.\"Calm down,\" he said, holding my arm gently.He made me sit down and put my notebook on my lap. He coaxed me to write. Hisargument was that I should not disturb the power place with unnecessary feelingsof fear or hesitation.\"Why do I get so nervous?\" I asked.\"It's natural,\" he said. \"Something in you is threatened by your activities indreaming. As long as you did not think about those activities, you were allright. But now that you have revealed your actions you're about to faint.\"Each warrior has his own way of dreaming. Each way is different. The only thingwhich we all have in common is that we play tricks in order to force ourselvesto abandon the quest. The countermeasure is to persist in spite of all thebarriers and disappointments.\"He asked me then if I was capable of selecting topics for dreaming. I said thatI did not have the faintest idea of how to do that.\"The sorcerers' explanation of how to select a topic for dreaming,\" he said, \"isthat a warrior chooses the topic by deliberately holding an image in his mindwhile he shuts off his internal dialogue. In other words, if he is capable ofnot talking to himself for a moment, and then holds the image or the thought ofwhat he wants in dreaming, even if only for an instant, then the desired topicwill come to him. I'm sure you've done that, although you were not aware of it.\"There was a long pause, and then don Juan began to sniff the air. It was as ifhe were cleaning his nose. He exhaled three or four times through his nostrilswith great force. The muscles of his abdomen contracted in spasms which hecontrolled by taking in short gasps of air.\"We won't talk about dreaming any more,\" he said. \"You might become obsessed. Ifone is to succeed in anything, the success must come gently; with a great dealof effort, but with no stress or obsession.\"He stood up and walked to the edge of the bushes. He leaned forward and peeredinto the foliage. He seemed to be examining something in the leaves withoutgetting too close to them.\"What are you doing?\" I asked, unable to contain my curiosity.He turned to me, smiled, and raised his brow.\"The bushes are filled with strange things,\" he said as he sat down again.His tone was so casual that it scared me more than if he had let out a suddenyell. My notebook and pencil fell from my hands. He laughed and mimicked me andsaid that my exaggerated reactions were one of the loose ends that still existedin my life.I wanted to raise a point, but he would not let me talk.\"There's only a bit of daylight left,\" he said. \"There are other things we oughtto touch upon before the twilight sets in.\"He then added, that judging by my production in dreaming, I must have learnedhow to stop my internal dialogue at will. I told him that I had.At the beginning of our association don Juan had delineated [* delineate-describe in vivid detail] another procedure: walking for long stretches withoutfocusing the eyes on anything. His recommendation had been to not look atanything directly; but rather, to slightly cross the eyes and keep a peripheralview of everything that presented itself to the eyes.He had insisted, although I had not understood at the time, that if one keptone's unfocused eyes at a point just above the horizon, it was possible tonotice, all at once, everything in almost the total 180-degree range in front ofone's eyes. He had assured me that that exercise was the only way of shuttingoff the internal dialogue. He used to ask me for reports on my progress, andthen he stopped inquiring about it.I told don Juan that I had practiced the technique for years without noticingany change; but I had expected none anyway. One day, however, I had the shockingrealization that I had just walked for about ten minutes without having said asingle word to myself.I mentioned to don Juan that on that occasion I also became cognizant [*cognizant- having realization or understanding] that stopping the internaldialogue involved more than merely curtailing the words I said to myself. Myentire thought processes had stopped, and I had felt I was practicallysuspended, floating. A sensation of panic had ensued from that awareness and Ihad to resume my internal dialogue as an antidote. [* antidote- a remedy thatstops or controls the effects of a poison]\"I've told you that the internal dialogue is what grounds us,\" don Juan said.\"The world is such and such, or so and so, only because we talk to ourselvesabout its being such and such or so and so.\"Don Juan explained that the passageway into the world of sorcerers opens upafter the warrior has learned to shut off the internal dialogue.\"To change our idea of the world is the crux [* crux- the most important point]of sorcery,\" he said. \"And stopping the internal dialogue is the only way toaccomplish it. The rest is just padding. Now you're in the position to know thatnothing of what you've seen or done, with the exception of stopping the internaldialogue, could by itself have changed anything in you, or in your idea of theworld. The provision is, of course, that that change should not be deranged. Nowyou can understand why a teacher doesn't clamp down on his apprentice. Thatwould only breed obsession and morbidity.\"He asked for details of other experiences I had had in shutting off the internaldialogue. I recounted everything that I could remember.We talked until it became dark and I could no longer take notes in a comfortablemanner. I had to pay attention to my writing, and that altered my concentration.Don Juan became aware of it and began to laugh. He pointed out that I hadaccomplished another sorcery task; writing without concentrating.The moment he said it, I realized that I really did not pay attention to the actof taking notes. It seemed to be a separate activity I had nothing to do with. Ifelt odd. Don Juan asked me to sit by him in the center of the circle. He saidit was too dark, and I was no longer safe sitting so close to the edge of thechaparral. I felt a chill up my back and jumped to his side.He made me face the southeast, and asked me to command myself to be silent andwithout thoughts. I could not do it at first and had a moment of impatience. DonJuan turned his back to me and told me to lean on his shoulder for support. Hesaid that once I had quieted down my thoughts, I should keep my eyes open,facing the bushes towards the southeast. In a mysterious tone he added that hewas setting up a problem for me, and that if I resolved it I would be ready foranother facet of the sorcerers' world.I posed a weak question about the nature of the problem. He chuckled softly. Iwaited for his answer; and then something in me was turned off. I felt I wassuspended. My ears seemed to unplug and a myriad of noises in the chaparralbecame audible. There were so many that I could not distinguish themindividually. I felt I was falling asleep and then all at once something caughtmy attention.It was not something which involved my thought processes. It was not a vision ora feature of the environment either, yet my awareness had been engaged bysomething. I was fully awake. My eyes were focused on a spot on the edge of thechaparral, but I was not looking, or thinking, or talking to myself.My feelings were clear bodily sensations. They did not need words. I felt I wasrushing through something indefinite. Perhaps what would have ordinarily been mythoughts were rushing. At any rate, I had the sensation that I had been caughtin a landslide, and something was avalanching with me at the crest. I felt therush in my stomach. Something was pulling me into the chaparral.I could distinguish the dark mass of the bushes in front of me. It was not,however, an undifferentiated darkness as it would ordinarily be. I could seeevery individual bush as if I were looking at them in a dark twilight. Theyseemed to be moving. The mass of their foliage looked like black skirts flowingtowards me as if they were being blown by the wind, but there was no wind. Ibecame absorbed in their mesmerizing movements. It was a pulsating ripple thatseemed to draw them nearer and nearer to me.And then I noticed a lighter silhouette which seemed to be superimposed on thedark shapes of the bushes. I focused my eyes on a spot to the side of thelighter silhouette, and I could make out a chartreuse glow on it. Then I lookedat it without focusing, and I had the certainty that the lighter silhouette wasa man hiding in the underbrush.I was, at that moment, in a most peculiar state of awareness. I was cognizant ofthe surroundings and of the mental processes that the surroundings engendered inmyself, yet I was not thinking as I ordinarily think.For instance, when I realized that the silhouette superimposed on the bushes wasa man, I recalled another occasion in the desert. I had noticed then, while donGenaro and I were walking in the chaparral at night, that a man was hiding inthe bushes behind us. But the instant I had attempted to explain the phenomenonrationally, I lost sight of the man.This time, however, I felt I had the upper hand, and I refused to explain or tothink anything at all. For a moment I had the impression that I could hold theman and force him to remain where he was. I then experienced a strange pain inthe pit of my stomach. Something seemed to rip inside me, and I could not holdthe muscles of my midsection tense any longer.At the very moment I let go, the dark shape of an enormous bird, or some sort offlying animal, lurched at me from the chaparral. It was as if the shape of theman had turned into the shape of a bird. I had the clear conscious perception offear. I gasped and then let out a loud yell and fell on my back.Don Juan helped me up. His face was very close to mine. He was laughing.\"What was that?\" I shouted.He hushed me, putting his hand over my mouth. He put his lips to my ear, andwhispered that we had to leave the area in a calm and collected fashion; as ifnothing had happened.We walked side by side. His pace was relaxed and even. A couple of times heturned around quickly. I did the same, and twice I caught sight of a dark massthat seemed to be following us. I heard a loud eerie shriek behind me. Iexperienced a moment of sheer terror. Ripples ran through the muscles of mystomach. They came in spasms and grew in intensity until they simply forced mybody to run.The only way of talking about my reaction has to be in don Juan's terminology;and thus I can say that my body, due to the fright I was experiencing, wascapable of executing what he had called 'the gait of power'- a technique he hadtaught me years before, consisting of running in the darkness without trippingor hurting oneself in any way.I was not fully aware of what I had done, or how I had done it. Suddenly I foundmyself again at don Juan's house. Apparently he had also run, and we had arrivedat the same time. He lit his kerosene lantern, hung it from a beam in theceiling, and casually asked me to sit down and relax.I jogged on the same spot for a while until my nervousness became moremanageable. Then I sat down. He forcefully ordered me to act as if nothing hadhappened, and handed me my notebook. I had not realized that in my haste toleave the bushes I had dropped it.\"What happened out there, don Juan?\" I finally asked.\"You had an appointment with knowledge,\" he said, pointing with a movement ofhis chin to the dark edge of the desert chaparral. \"I took you there because Icaught a glimpse of knowledge prowling around the house earlier. You might saythat knowledge knew that you were coming and was waiting for you. Rather thanmeeting it here, I felt it was proper to meet it on a power spot. Then I set upa test to see if you had enough personal power to isolate it from the rest ofthe things around us. You did fine.\"\"Wait a minute!\" I protested. \"I saw the silhouette of a man hiding behind abush, and then I saw a huge bird.\"\"You didn't see a man!\" he said emphatically. \"Neither did you see a bird. Thesilhouette in the bushes and what flew to us was a moth. If you want to beaccurate in sorcerers' terms, but very ridiculous in your own terms, you couldsay that tonight you had an appointment with a moth. Knowledge is a moth.\"He looked at me piercingly. The light of the lantern created strange shadows onhis face. I moved my eyes away.\"Perhaps you'll have enough personal power to unravel that mystery tonight,\" hesaid. \"If not tonight, perhaps tomorrow. Remember, you still owe me six days.\"Don Juan stood up and walked to the kitchen in the back of the house. He tookthe lantern and set it against the wall on the short round stump that he used asa bench. We sat down on the floor opposite each other, and served ourselves somebeans and meat from a pot that he had placed in front of us. We ate in silence.He gave me furtive glances from time to time, and seemed on the verge oflaughing. His eyes were like two slits. When he looked at me he would open thema bit and the moistness of the corneas reflected the light of the lantern. Itwas as if he were using the light to create a mirror reflection. He played withit, shaking his head almost imperceptibly every time he focused his eyes on me.The effect was a fascinating quiver of light. I became aware of his maneuversafter he had executed them a couple of times. I was convinced that he was actingwith a definite purpose in mind. I felt compelled to ask him about it.\"I have an ulterior [* ulterior- beyond what is openly revealed; kept in thebackground or deliberately concealed] reason,\" he said reassuringly. \"I'msoothing you with my eyes. You don't seem to be getting more nervous, do you?\"I had to admit that I felt quite at ease. The steady flicker in his eyes was notmenacing, and it had not scared or annoyed me in any way.\"How do you soothe me with your eyes?\" I asked.He repeated the imperceptible shake of his head. The corneas of his eyes wereindeed reflecting the light of the kerosene lantern.\"Try to do it yourself,\" he said casually as he gave himself another serving offood. \"You can soothe yourself.\"I tried to shake my head. My movements were awkward.\"You won't soothe yourself bobbing your head like that,\" he said and laughed.\"You'll give yourself a headache instead. The secret is not in the head shakebut in the feeling that comes to the eyes from the area below the stomach. Thisis what makes the head shake.\"He rubbed his umbilical region.After I had finished eating I slouched against a pile of wood and some burlapsacks. I tried to imitate his head shake. Don Juan seemed to be enjoying himselfimmensely. He giggled and slapped his thighs.Then a sudden noise interrupted his laughter. I heard a strange deep sound- liketapping on wood- that came from the chaparral. Don Juan jutted his chin,signaling me to remain alert.\"That's the little moth calling you,\" he said in an unemotional tone.I jumped to my feet. The sound ceased instantaneously. I looked at don Juan foran explanation. He made a comical gesture of helplessness, shrugging hisshoulders.\"You haven't fulfilled your appointment yet,\" he added.I told him that I felt unworthy, and that perhaps I should go home and come backwhen I felt stronger.\"You're talking nonsense,\" he snapped. \"A warrior takes his lot, whatever it maybe, and accepts it in ultimate humbleness. He accepts in humbleness what he is;not as grounds for regret, but as a living challenge.\"It takes time for every one of us to understand that point and fully live it.I, for instance, hated the mere mention of the word 'humbleness.' I'm an Indianand we Indians have always been humble, and have done nothing else but lower ourheads. I thought humbleness was not in the warrior's way. I was wrong!\"I know now that the humbleness of a warrior is not the humbleness of a beggar.The warrior lowers his head to no one, but at the same time he doesn't permitanyone to lower his head to him.\"The beggar, on the other hand, falls to his knees at the drop of a hat andscrapes the floor for anyone he deems to be higher; but at the same time, hedemands that someone lower than him scrape the floor for him.\"That's why I told you earlier today that I didn't understand what masters feltlike. I know only the humbleness of a warrior, and that will never permit me tobe anyone's master.\"We were quiet for a moment. His words had caused me a profound agitation. I wasmoved by them; and at the same time I felt concerned with what I had witnessedin the chaparral. My conscious assessment was that don Juan was holding out onme, and that he must have known what was really taking place.I was involved in those deliberations when the same strange tapping noise joltedme out of my thoughts. Don Juan smiled and then began to chuckle.\"You like the humbleness of a beggar,\" he said softly. \"You bow your head toreason.\"\"I always think that I'm being tricked,\" I said. \"That's the crux of myproblem.\"\"You're right. You are being tricked,\" he retorted with a disarming smile. \"Thatcannot be your problem. The real crux of the matter is that you feel that I amdeliberately lying to you, am I correct?\"\"Yes. There is something in myself that doesn't let me believe that what'staking place is real.\"\"You're right again. Nothing of what is taking place is real.\"\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\"\"Things are real only after one has learned to agree on their realness. Whattook place this evening, for instance, cannot possibly be real to you because noone could agree with you about it.\"\"Do you mean that you didn't see what happened?\"\"Of course I did. But I don't count. I am the one who's lying to you, remember?\"Don Juan laughed until he coughed and choked. His laughter was friendly eventhough he was making fun of me.\"Don't pay too much attention to all my gibberish,\" he said reassuringly. \"I'mjust trying to relax you, and I know that you feel at home only when you'remuddled up.\"His expression was deliberately comical and we both laughed. I told him thatwhat he had just said made me feel more afraid than ever.\"You're afraid of me?\" he asked.\"Not of you, but of what you represent.\"\"I represent the warrior's freedom. Are you afraid of that?\"\"No. But I'm afraid of the awesomeness of your knowledge. There is no solace forme; no haven to go to.\"\"You're again confusing issues. Solace, haven, fear: all of them are moods thatyou have learned without ever questioning their value. As one can see, the blackmagicians have already engaged all your allegiance.\"\"Who are the black magicians, don Juan?\"\"Our fellow men are the black magicians. And since you are with them, you tooare a black magician. Think for a moment. Can you deviate from the path thatthey've lined up for you?\"No. Your thoughts and your actions are fixed forever in their terms. That isslavery. I, on the other hand, brought you freedom. Freedom is expensive, butthe price is not impossible. So, fear your captors- your masters. Don't wasteyour time and your power fearing me.\"I knew that he was right, and yet, in spite of my genuine agreement with him, Ialso knew that my lifelong habits would unavoidably make me stick to my oldpath. I did indeed feel like a slave.After a long silence don Juan asked me if I had enough strength for another boutwith knowledge.\"Do you mean with the moth?\" I asked half in jest.His body contorted with laughter. It was as if I had just told him the funniestjoke in the world.\"What do you really mean when you say that knowledge is a moth?\" I asked.\"I have no other meanings,\" he replied. \"A moth is a moth. I thought that bynow, with all your accomplishments, you would have had enough power to 'see'.You caught sight of a man instead and that was not true seeing.\"From the beginning of my apprenticeship, don Juan had depicted the concept ofseeing as a special capacity that one could develop and which would allow one toapprehend the 'ultimate' nature of things.Over the years of our association I had developed a notion that what he meant byseeing was: an intuitive grasp of things; or the capacity to understandsomething at once; or perhaps the ability to see through human interactions anddiscover covert meanings and motives.\"I should say that tonight, when you faced the moth, you were half looking andhalf seeing,\" don Juan proceeded. \"In that state, although you were notaltogether your usual self, you were still capable of being fully aware in orderto operate your knowledge of the world.\"Don Juan paused and looked at me. I did not know what to say at first.\"How was I operating my knowledge of the world?\" I asked.\"Your knowledge of the world told you that in the bushes one can only findanimals prowling or men hiding behind the foliage. You held that thought, andnaturally you had to find ways to make the world conform to that thought.\"\"But I wasn't thinking at all, don Juan.\"\"Let's not call it thinking then. It is rather the habit of having the worldalways conform to our thoughts. When it doesn't, we simply make it conform.Moths as large as a man cannot be even a thought, therefore, for you, what wasin the bushes had to be a man.\"The same thing happened with the coyote. Your old habits decided the nature ofthat encounter too. Something took place between you and the coyote, but itwasn't talk. I have been in the same quandary myself. I've told you that once Italked with a deer. Now you've talked to a coyote, but neither you nor I willever know what really took place at those times.\"\"What are you telling me, don Juan?\"\"When the sorcerers' explanation became clear to me, it was too late to knowwhat the deer did to me. I said that we talked, but that wasn't so. To say thatwe had a conversation is only a way of arranging it so I can talk about it. Thedeer and I did something, but at the time it was taking place I needed to makethe world conform to my ideas; just like you did. I had been talking all mylife, just like you, therefore my habits prevailed and were extended to thedeer. When the deer came to me, and did whatever it did, I was forced tounderstand it as talking.\"\"Is this the sorcerers' explanation?\"\"No. This is my explanation for you. But it is not opposed to the sorcerers'explanation.\"His statement threw me into a state of great intellectual excitation. For awhile I forgot the prowling moth, or even to take notes. I tried to rephrase hisstatements, and we involved ourselves in a long discussion about the reflexivenature of our world. The world, according to don Juan, had to conform to itsdescription; that is, the description reflected itself.Another point in his elucidation [* elucidation- an act of explaining thatserves to clear up and cast light on] was that we had learned to relateourselves to our description of the world in terms of what he called 'habits'. Iintroduced what I thought was a more engulfing term, intentionality- theproperty of human consciousness whereby an object is referred to, or isintended.Our conversation engendered a most interesting speculation. Examined in light ofdon Juan's explanation, my 'talk' with the coyote acquired a new character. Ihad indeed 'intended' the dialogue since I have never known another avenue ofintentional communication. I had also succeeded in conforming to the descriptionthat communication takes place through dialogue, and thus I made the descriptionreflect itself.I had a moment of great elation. Don Juan laughed and said that to be so movedby words was another aspect of my foolery. He made a comical gesture of talkingwithout sounds.\"All of us go through the same shenanigans,\" he said after a long pause. \"Theonly way to overcome them is to persist in acting like a warrior. The rest comesof itself and by itself.\"\"What is the rest, don Juan?\"\"Knowledge and power. Men of knowledge have both. And yet none of them couldtell how they got to have them, except that they had kept on acting likewarriors and at a given moment everything changed.\"He looked at me. He seemed undecided. Then he stood up, and said that I had noother recourse than to keep my appointment with knowledge.I felt a shiver. My heart began to pound fast. I got up. Don Juan moved aroundme as if he were examining my body from every possible angle. He signaled me tosit down and keep on writing.\"If you get too frightened you won't be able to keep your appointment,\" he said.\"A warrior must be calm and collected, and must never lose his grip.\"\"I'm really scared,\" I said. \"Moth or whatever, there is something prowlingaround out there in the bushes.\"\"Of course there is!\" he exclaimed. \"My objection is that you insist on thinkingthat it is a man, just like you insist on thinking that you talked with acoyote.\"A part of me fully understood his point. There was, however, another aspect ofmyself that would not let go, and in spite of the evidence clung steadfast to'reason'.I told don Juan that his explanation did not satisfy my senses, although I wasin complete intellectual agreement with it.\"That's the flaw with words,\" he said in an assuring tone. \"They always force usto feel enlightened, but when we turn around to face the world they always failus, and we end up facing the world as we always have; without enlightenment. Forthis reason, a sorcerer seeks to act rather than to talk; and to this effect hegets a new description of the world- a new description where talking is not thatimportant, and where new acts have new reflections.\"He sat down by me and gazed into my eyes, and asked me to voice what I hadreally 'seen' in the chaparral.I was confronted at the moment with an absorbing inconsistency. I had seen thedark shape of a man, but I had also seen that shape turn into a bird. I had,therefore, witnessed more than my reason would allow me to consider possible.But rather than discarding my reason altogether, something in myself hadselected parts of my experience, such as the size and general contour of thedark shape, and held them as reasonable possibilities, while it discarded otherparts, such as the dark shape turning into a bird. And thus I had becomeconvinced that I had seen a man.Don Juan roared with laughter when I expressed my quandary. He said that sooneror later the sorcerers' explanation would come to my rescue, and everythingwould then be perfectly clear without having to be reasonable or unreasonable.\"In the meantime all I can do for you is to guarantee that that was not a man,\"he said.Don Juan's gaze became quite unnerving. My body shivered involuntarily. He mademe feel embarrassed and nervous.\"I'm looking for marks on your body,\" he explained. \"You may not know it, butthis evening you had quite a bout out there.\"\"What kind of marks are you looking for?\"\"Not actual physical marks on your body, but signs- indications in your luminousfibers; areas of brightness. We are luminous beings, and everything we are, oreverything we feel, shows in our fibers. Humans have a brightness peculiar onlyto them. That's the only way to tell them apart from other luminous livingbeings.\"If you would have seen tonight, you would have noticed that the shape in thebushes was not a luminous living being.\"I wanted to ask more but he put his hand on my mouth and hushed me. He then puthis mouth to my ear, and whispered that I should listen, and try to hear a softrustling; the gentle muffled steps of a moth on the dry leaves and branches onthe ground.I could not hear anything. Don Juan stood up abruptly, picked up the lantern,and said that we were going to sit under the ramada by the front door.Rather than going through the room and out the front door, he led me through theback and around the house on the edge of the chaparral. He explained that it wasessential to make our presence obvious. We half circled around the house on theleft side. Don Juan's pace was extremely slow. His steps were weak andvacillating. His arm shook as he held the lantern.I asked him if there was something wrong with him. He winked at me and whisperedthat the big moth that was prowling around had an appointment with a young man,and that the slow gait of a feeble old man was an obvious way of showing who wasthe appointee.When we finally arrived at the front of the house, don Juan hooked the lanternon a beam and made me sit with my back against the wall. He sat to my right.\"We're going to sit here,\" he said, \"and you are going to write and talk to mein a very normal manner. The moth that lurched at you today is around; in thebushes. After a while it'll come closer to look at you. That's why I've put thelantern on a beam right above you. The light will guide the moth to find you.When it gets to the edge of the bushes, it will call you. It is a very specialsound. The sound by itself may help you.\"\"What kind of sound is it, don Juan?\"\"It is a song. A haunting call that moths produce. Ordinarily it cannot beheard, but the moth out there in the bushes is a rare moth. You will hear itscall clearly; and providing that you are impeccable, it will remain with you forthe rest of your life.\"\"What is it going to help me with?\"\"Tonight you're going to try to finish what you've started earlier. Seeinghappens only when the warrior is capable of stopping the internal dialogue.\"Today out there in the bushes you stopped your talk at will, and you 'saw'.What you 'saw' was not clear. You thought that it was a man. I say it was amoth. Neither of us is correct, but that's because we have to talk. I still havethe upper hand because I 'see' better than you, and because I'm familiar withthe sorcerers' explanation. So I know, although it's not altogether accurate,that the shape you saw tonight was a moth.\"And now you're going to remain silent and thoughtless, and let that little mothcome to you again.\"I could hardly take notes. Don Juan laughed and urged me to keep on writing asif nothing bothered me. He touched my arm and said that writing was the bestprotective shield that I had.\"We've never talked about moths,\" he went on. \"The time was not right until now.As you already know, your spirit was unbalanced. To counteract that I taught youto live the warrior's way. Well, a warrior starts off with the certainty thathis spirit is off balance. Then by living in full control and awareness, butwithout hurry or compulsion, he does his ultimate best to gain this balance.\"In your case, as in the case of every man, your imbalance was due to the sumtotal of all your actions. But now your spirit seems to be in the proper lightto talk about moths.\"\"How did you know that this was the right time to talk about moths?\"\"I caught a glimpse of the moth prowling around when you arrived. It was thefirst time it was friendly and open. I had seen it before in the mountainsaround Genaro's house, but only as a menacing figure reflecting your lack oforder.\"I heard a strange sound at that moment. It was like a muffled creaking of abranch rubbing against another; or like the sputtering of a small motor heardfrom a distance. It changed scales, like a musical tone, creating an eerierhythm. Then it stopped.\"That was the moth,\" don Juan said. \"Perhaps you've already noticed that,although the light of the lantern is bright enough to attract moths, there isn'ta single one flying around it.\"I had not paid attention to it, but once don Juan made me aware of it, I alsonoticed an incredible silence in the desert around the house.\"Don't get jumpy,\" he said calmly. \"There is nothing in this world that awarrior cannot account for. You see, a warrior considers himself already dead,so there is nothing for him to lose. The worst has already happened to him,therefore he's clear and calm. Judging him by his acts, or by his words, onewould never suspect that he has witnessed everything.\"Don Juan's words, and above all, his mood, were very soothing to me. I told himthat in my day-to-day life I no longer experienced the obsessive fear I used to,but that my body entered into convulsions of fright at the thought of what wasout there in the dark.\"Out there, there is only knowledge,\" he said in a factual tone. \"Knowledge isfrightening, true; but if a warrior accepts the frightening nature of knowledgehe cancels out its awesomeness.\"The strange sputtering noise happened again. It seemed closer and louder. Ilistened carefully. The more attention I paid to it, the more difficult it wasto determine its nature. It did not seem to be the call of a bird or the cry ofa land animal.The tone of each sputter was rich and deep. Some were produced in a low key.Others in a high one. They had a rhythm and a specific duration. Some were long.I heard them like a single unit of sound. Others were short and happened in acluster, like the staccato sound of a machine gun.\"The moths are the heralds, or, better yet, the guardians of eternity,\" don Juansaid after the sound had stopped. \"For some reason, or for no reason at all,they are the depositories of the gold dust of eternity.\"The metaphor was foreign to me. I asked him to explain it.\"The moths carry a dust on their wings,\" he said. \"A dark gold dust. That dustis the dust of knowledge.\"His explanation had made the metaphor even more obscure. I vacillated [*vacillate- be undecided about something; waver between conflicting positions orcourses] for a moment, trying to find the best way of wording my question. Buthe began to talk again.\"Knowledge is a most peculiar affair,\" he said, \"especially for a warrior.Knowledge for a warrior is something that comes at once, engulfs him, and passeson.\"\"What does knowledge have to do with the dust on the wings of moths?\" I askedafter a long pause.\"Knowledge comes floating like specks of gold dust; the same dust that coversthe wings of moths. So, for a warrior, knowledge is like taking a shower, orbeing rained on by specks of dark gold dust.\"In the most polite manner I was capable of, I mentioned that his explanationshad confused me even more. He laughed and assured me that he was making perfectsense, except that my reason would not allow me to be at ease.\"The moths have been the intimate friends and helpers of sorcerers from timeimmemorial,\" he said. \"I had not touched upon this subject before because ofyour lack of preparation.\"\"But how can the dust on their wings be knowledge?\"\"You'll see.\"He put his hand over my notebook, and told me to close my eyes, and becomesilent and without thoughts. He said that the call of the moth in the chaparralwas going to aid me. If I paid attention to it, it would tell me of imminentevents. He stressed that he did not know how the communication between the mothand myself was going to be established. Neither did he know what the terms ofthe communication would be. He urged me to feel at ease and confident, and trustmy personal power.After an initial period of impatience and nervousness I succeeded in becomingsilent. My thoughts diminished in number until my mind was perfectly blank. Thenoises of the desert chaparral seemed to have been turned on as I became morecalm.The strange sound that don Juan said was made by a moth occurred again. Itregistered as a feeling in my body and not as a thought in my mind. It occurredto me that it was not threatening or malevolent at all. It was sweet and simple.It was like a child's call. It brought back the memory of a little boy that Ionce knew. The long sounds reminded me of his round blond head; the shortstaccato sounds of his laughter.The most anguishing feeling oppressed me, and yet there were no thoughts in mymind. I felt the anguish in my body. I could no longer remain sitting and slidto the floor on my side.My sadness was so intense that I began to think. I assessed my pain and sorrow,and suddenly found myself in the midst of an internal debate about the littleboy. The sputtering sound had ceased. My eyes were closed.I heard don Juan standing up, and then I felt him helping me to sit up. I didnot want to speak. He did not say a word. I heard him moving by me. I opened myeyes. He had knelt in front of me and was examining my face; holding the lanternclose to me. He ordered me to put my hands over my stomach. He stood up, went tothe kitchen, and brought me some water. He splashed some on my face and gave methe rest to drink.He sat down next to me and handed me my notes. I told him that the sound hadinvolved me in the most painful reverie.\"You are indulging beyond your limits,\" he said dryly.He seemed to immerse himself in thought as if he were searching for anappropriate suggestion to make.\"The problem for tonight is seeing people,\" he finally said. \"First you muststop your internal dialogue. Then you must bring up the image of the person thatyou want to see. Any thought that one holds in mind in a state of silence isproperly a command since there are no other thoughts to compete with it. Tonightthe moth in the bushes wants to help you; so it will sing for you. Its song willbring the golden specks, and then you will see the person you've selected.\"I wanted to have more details, but he made an abrupt gesture and signaled me toproceed.After struggling for a few minutes to stop my internal dialogue, I wasthoroughly silent. And then I deliberately held the brief thought of a friend ofmine. I kept my eyes closed for what I believed to be just an instant, and thenI became aware that someone was shaking me by the shoulders.It was a slow realization. I opened my eyes and found myself lying on my leftside. I had apparently fallen asleep so deeply that I did not remember havingslumped to the ground. Don Juan helped me to sit up again. He was laughing. Heimitated my snoring and said that if he had not witnessed it himself he wouldnot believe that anyone could fall asleep so fast. He said that it was a treatfor him to be around me whenever I had to do something that my reason did notunderstand. He pushed my notebook away from me, and said that we had to startall over.I followed the necessary steps. The strange sputtering sound happened again.This time, however, it did not come from the chaparral. Rather, it seemed tohappen inside of me as if my lips, or legs, or arms were producing it. The soundsoon engulfed me. I felt like soft balls were being sputtered out from oragainst me. It was a soothing, exquisite feeling of being bombarded by heavycotton puffs.Suddenly I heard a door blown open by a gust of wind and I was thinking again. Ithought that I had ruined another chance.I opened my eyes and found myself in my room. The objects on my desk were as Ihad left them. The door was open. There was a strong wind outside. The thoughtcrossed my mind that I should check the water heater. I then heard a rattling onthe sliding windows that I had put up myself; and which did not fit well on thewindow frame. It was a furious rattling as if someone wanted to enter. Iexperienced a jolt of fright. I stood up from my chair. I felt something pullingme. I screamed.Don Juan was shaking me by the shoulders. I excitedly gave him an account of myvision. It had been so vivid that I was shivering. I felt that I had just beenat my desk, in my full corporeal form.Don Juan shook his head in disbelief, and said that I was a genius in trickingmyself. He did not seem impressed by what I had done. He discarded it flatly andordered me to start again.I then heard the mysterious sound again. It came to me, as don Juan hadsuggested, in the form of a rain of golden specks. I did not feel that they wereflat specks or flakes, as he had described them, but rather spherical bubbles.They floated towards me. One of them burst open and revealed a scene to me. Itwas as if it had stopped in front of my eyes and opened up; disclosing a strangeobject.It looked like a mushroom. I was definitely looking at it, and what I wasexperiencing was not a dream. The mushroomlike object remained unchanged withinmy field of 'vision', and then it popped as though the light that was shining onit had been turned off. An interminable darkness followed it.I felt a tremor- a very unsettling jolt- and then I had the abrupt realizationthat I was being shaken. All at once my senses were turned on. Don Juan wasshaking me vigorously and I was looking at him. I must have just opened my eyesat that moment. He sprinkled water on my face. The coldness of the water wasvery appealing. After a moment's pause he wanted to know what had happened.I recounted every detail of my vision.\"But what did I see?\" I asked.\"Your friend,\" he retorted.I laughed and patiently explained that I had 'seen' a mushroom-like figure.Although I had no criteria to judge dimensions, I had had the feeling that itwas about a foot long.Don Juan emphasized that 'feeling' was all that counted. He said that myfeelings were the gauge that assessed the state of being of the subject that Iwas seeing.\"From your description, and your feelings, I must conclude that your friend mustbe a very fine man,\" he said. I was baffled by his words.He said that the mushroomlike formation was the essential shape of human beingswhen a sorcerer was seeing them from far away. But when a sorcerer was directlyfacing the person he was seeing, the human quality was shown as an egglikecluster of luminous fibers.\"You were not facing your friend,\" he said. \"Therefore, he appeared like amushroom.\"\"Why is that so, don Juan?\"\"No one knows. That simply is the way men appear in this specific type ofseeing.\"He added that every feature of the mushroomlike formation had a specialsignificance, but that it was impossible for a beginner to accurately interpretthat significance.I then had an intriguing recollection. Some years before while I was in a stateof nonordinary reality elicited by the intake of psychotropic plants, I hadexperienced or perceived, while I was looking at a water stream, that a clusterof bubbles floated towards me; engulfing me. The golden bubbles I had justenvisioned had floated and engulfed me in exactly the same manner. In fact, Icould say that both clusters had had the same structure and the same pattern.Don Juan listened to my commentaries without interest.\"Don't waste your power on trifles,\" he said. \"You are dealing with thatimmensity out there.\"He pointed towards the chaparral with a movement of his hand.\"To turn that magnificence out there into reasonableness doesn't do anything foryou. Here, surrounding us, is eternity itself. To engage in reducing it to amanageable nonsense is petty and outright disastrous.\"He then insisted that I should attempt to 'see' another person from my realm ofacquaintances. He added that once the vision had terminated I should strive toopen my eyes by myself, and surface to the full awareness of my immediatesurroundings.I succeeded in holding the view of another mushroomlike form, but while thefirst one had been yellowish and small, the second one was whitish, larger, andcontorted.By the time we had finished talking about the two shapes I had 'seen', I hadforgotten the 'moth' in the bushes which had been so overwhelming a little whilebefore. I told don Juan that it amazed me that I had such a facility fordiscarding something so truly uncanny. It was as if I were not the person I knewmyself to be.\"I don't see why you make such a fuss out of this,\" don Juan said. \"Whenever thedialogue stops, the world collapses and extraordinary facets of ourselvessurface; as though they had been kept heavily guarded by our words. You are likeyou are because you tell yourself that you are that way.\"After a short rest don Juan urged me to continue 'calling' friends. He said thatthe point was to attempt to 'see' as many times as possible in order toestablish a guideline for feeling.I called thirty-two persons in succession. After each attempt he demanded acareful and detailed rendition of everything I had perceived in my vision. Hechanged that procedure, however, as I became more proficient in my performance;judging by my stopping the internal dialogue in a matter of seconds; by my beingcapable of opening my eyes by myself at the end of each experience; and by myresuming ordinary activities without any transition.I noticed this change while we were discussing the coloration of themushroomlike formations. He had already made the point that what I calledcoloration was not a hue, but a glow of different intensities.I was about to describe a yellowish glow that I had envisioned, when heinterrupted me, and he accurately described what I had 'seen.' From that pointon he discussed the content of each vision, not as if he had understood what Ihad said, but as if he had 'seen' it himself. When I called him to comment on ithe flatly refused to talk about it.By the time I had finished calling the thirty-two persons, I had realized that Ihad 'seen' a variety of mushroomlike shapes and glows, and I had had a varietyof feelings towards them; ranging from mild delight to sheer disgust.Don Juan explained that men were filled with configurations that could bewishes, problems, sorrows, worries, and so on. He asserted that only aprofoundly powerful sorcerer could untangle the meaning of those configurations,and that I had to be content with viewing only the general shape of men.I was very tired. There was something indeed fatiguing about those strangeshapes. My overall sensation was one of queasiness. I had not liked them. Theyhad made me feel trapped and doomed.Don Juan commanded me to write in order to dispel the sensation of somberness.After a long silent interval during which I could not write anything, he askedme to call on people that he himself would select.A new series of forms emerged. They were not mushroomlike, but looked more likeJapanese cups for sake, turned upside down. Some of them had a headlikeformation just like the foot of sake cups. Others were more round. Their shapeswere appealing and peaceful. I sensed that there was some inherent feeling ofhappiness about them. They bounced as opposed to the earthbound heaviness thatthe previous batch had exhibited. Somehow, the mere fact that they were thereeased my fatigue.Among the persons he had selected was his apprentice Eligio. When I summoned thevision of Eligio I got a jolt that shook me out of my visionary state. Eligiohad a long white shape that jerked and seemed to leap at me. Don Juan explainedthat Eligio was a very talented apprentice and that he, no doubt, had noticedthat someone was seeing him.Another of don Juan's selections was Pablito, don Genaro's apprentice. The joltthat the vision of Pablito gave me was even greater than Eligio's.Don Juan laughed so hard that tears rolled down his cheeks.\"Why are those people shaped differently?\" I asked.\"They have more personal power,\" he replied. \"As you might have noticed, theyare not pegged down to the ground.\"\"What has given them that lightness? Were they born that way?\"\"We all are born that light and bouncy, but we become earth-bound and fixed. Wemake ourselves that way. So perhaps we may say that these people are shapeddifferently because they live like warriors. That's not important though. What'sof value is that you are at the edge now. You've called forty-seven people, andthere is only one more left in order for you to complete the originalforty-eight.\"I remembered at that moment that years before he had told me, while discussingcorn sorcery and divination, that the number of corn kernels that a sorcererpossessed was forty-eight. He had never explained why.I asked him again, \"Why forty-eight?\"\"Forty-eight is our number,\" he said. \"That's what makes us men. I don't knowwhy. Don't waste your power in idiotic questions.\"He stood up and stretched his arms and legs. He told me to do the same. Inoticed that there was a tinge of light in the sky towards the east. We sat downagain. He leaned over and put his mouth to my ear.\"The last person you're going to call is Genaro; the real McCoy,\" he whispered.I felt a surge of curiosity and excitation. I breezed through the requiredsteps. The strange sound from the edge of the chaparral became vivid andacquired new strength. I had almost forgotten about it. The golden bubblesengulfed me, and then in one of them I saw don Genaro himself. He was standingin front of me holding his hat in his hand. He was smiling.I hurriedly opened my eyes and was about to speak to don Juan, but before Icould say a word my body stiffened like a board. My hair stood on end, and for along moment I did not know what to do or say. Don Genaro was standing right infront of me. In person!I turned to don Juan; he was smiling. Then both of them broke into a giantlaugh. I also tried to laugh. I could not. I stood up.Don Juan handed me a cup of water. I drank it automatically. I thought he wasgoing to sprinkle water on my face. Instead, he refilled my cup.Don Genaro scratched his head and hid a grin.\"Aren't you going to greet Genaro?\" don Juan asked.It took an enormous effort for me to organize my thoughts and my feelings. Ifinally mumbled some greetings to don Genaro. He took a bow.\"You called me, didn't you?\" he asked, smiling.I muttered my amazement at having found him standing there.\"He did call you,\" don Juan interjected.\"Well, here I am,\" don Genaro said to me. \"What can I do for you?\"Slowly my mind seemed to become organized and finally I had a sudden insight. Mythoughts were crystal clear and I 'knew' what had really taken place. I figuredthat don Genaro had been visiting with don Juan, and that as soon as they hadheard my car approaching, don Genaro had slipped into the bushes and hadremained in hiding until it got dark.I believed the evidence was convincing. Don Juan, since he had no doubtengineered the entire affair, gave me clues from time to time thus guiding itsdevelopment. At the appropriate time, don Genaro had made me notice hispresence, and when don Juan and I were walking back to the house, he followed usin the most obvious manner in order to arouse my fear. Then he had waited in thechaparral and made the strange sound whenever don Juan had signaled him. Thefinal signal to come out from behind the bushes must have been given by don Juanwhile my eyes were closed after he had asked me to 'call' don Genaro. Then donGenaro must have walked to the ramada and waited until I opened my eyes, andthen scared me out of my wits.The only incongruencies in my logical explanatory scheme were that I hadactually seen the man hiding in the bushes turn into a bird, and that I hadfirst visualized don Genaro as an image in a golden bubble. In my vision he hadbeen dressed exactly as he was in person. Since there was no logical way for meto explain those incongruencies, I assumed, as I have always done in similarcircumstances, that the emotional stress may have played an important role indetermining what I 'believed I saw'.I began to laugh quite involuntarily at the thought of their preposterous trick.I told them about my deductions. They laughed uproariously. I honestly believedthat their laughter was the giveaway.\"You were hiding in the bushes, weren't you?\" I asked don Genaro.Don Juan sat down and held his head in both hands.\"No. I wasn't hiding,\" don Genaro said patiently. \"I was far from here, and thenyou called. So I came to see you.\"\"Where were you, don Genaro?\"\"Far away.\"\"How far?\"Don Juan interrupted me and said that don Genaro had showed up as an act ofdeference [* deference- a courteous expression of esteem by: word, deed, orregard of action] to me, and that I could not ask where he had been, because hehad been nowhere.Don Genaro came to my defense and said that it was all right to ask himanything.\"If you were not hiding around the house, where were you, don Genaro?\" I asked.\"I was at my house,\" he said with great candor.\"In central Mexico?\"\"Yes! It's the only house I've got.\"They looked at each other and again broke into laughter. I knew that they werekidding me, but I decided not to contest the point any further. I thought theymust have had a reason for engaging themselves in such an elaborate production.I sat down.I felt that I was truthfully cut in two. Some part of me was not shocked at all,and could accept any of don Juan or don Genaro's acts at their face value. Butthere was another part of me that flatly refused. It was my strongest part. Myconscious assessment was that I had accepted don Juan's sorcery description ofthe world merely on an intellectual basis, while my body as a whole entityrefused it; thus my dilemma.But then, over the course of the years of my association with don Juan and donGenaro I had experienced extraordinary phenomena, and those had been bodilyexperiences not intellectual ones. Earlier that very night I had executed the'gait of power'; which from the point of view of my intellect was aninconceivable accomplishment. And best of all, I had had incredible visionsthrough no other means than my own volition.I explained to them the nature of my painful and at the same time bona fideperplexity.\"This guy is a genius,\" don Juan said to don Genaro, shaking his head indisbelief.\"You're a huge genius, Carlitos,\" don Genaro said as if he were relaying amessage.They sat down on either side of me; don Juan to my right and don Genaro to myleft. Don Juan observed that soon it was going to be morning. At that instant Iagain heard the moth's call. It had moved. The sound was coming from theopposite direction. I looked at both of them, holding their gaze. My logicalscheme began to disintegrate.The sound had a mesmerizing richness and depth. Then I heard muffled steps; softfeet crushing the dry underbrush. The sputtering sound came closer and I huddledagainst don Juan. He dryly ordered me to 'see' it. I made a supreme effort; notso much to please him as to please myself. I had been sure that don Genaro wasthe moth. But don Genaro was sitting with me. What, then, was in the bushes? Amoth?The sputtering sound echoed in my ears. I could not stop my internal dialoguealtogether. I heard the sound, but I could not feel it in my body as I had doneearlier. I heard definite steps. Something was creeping in the dark. There was aloud cracking noise as if a branch had been snapped in two, and suddenly aterrifying memory seized me. Years before I had spent a dreadful night in thewilderness and had been harassed by something; something very light and softthat had stepped on my neck over and over while I crouched on the ground. DonJuan had explained the event as an encounter with 'the ally'; a mysterious forcethat a sorcerer learned to perceive as an entity.I leaned closer to don Juan and whispered what I had remembered. Don Genarocrawled on all fours to get closer to us.\"What did he say?\" he asked don Juan in a whisper.\"He said that there is an ally out there,\" don Juan replied in a low voice.Don Genaro crawled back and sat down. Then he turned to me and said in a loudwhisper, \"You're a genius.\"They laughed quietly. Don Genaro pointed towards the chaparral with a movementof his chin.\"Go out there and grab it,\" he said. \"Take off your clothes and scare the devilout of that ally.\"They shook with laughter. The sound in the meantime had ceased. Don Juan orderedme to stop my thoughts, but to keep my eyes open; focused on the edge of thechaparral in front of me. He said that the moth had changed positions becausedon Genaro was there, and that if it were going to manifest itself to me, itwould choose to come from the front.After a moment's struggle to quiet my thoughts, I perceived the sound again. Itwas richer than ever. I heard first the muffled steps on dry twigs and then Ifelt them on my body. At that instant I distinguished a dark mass directly infront of me at the edge of the chaparral.I felt I was being shaken. I opened my eyes. Don Juan and don Genaro werestanding above me, and I was kneeling as if I had fallen asleep in a crouchingposition. Don Juan gave me some water and I sat down again with my back againstthe wall.A short while later it was dawn. The chaparral seemed to wake up. The morningcold was crisp and invigorating.The moth had not been don Genaro. My rational structure was falling apart. I didnot want to ask any more questions, nor did I want to remain quiet. I finallyhad to talk.\"But if you were in central Mexico, don Genaro, how did you get here?\" I asked.Don Genaro made some ludicrous and utterly hilarious gestures with his mouth.\"I'm sorry,\" he said to me, \"my mouth doesn't want to talk.\"He then turned to don Juan and said, grinning, \"Why don't you tell him?\"Don Juan vacillated. Then he said that don Genaro, as a consummate artist ofsorcery, was capable of prodigious deeds.Don Genaro's chest swelled as if don Juan's words were inflating it. He seemedto have inhaled so much air that his chest looked twice its normal size. Heappeared to be on the verge of floating. He leaped in the air. I had theimpression that the air inside his lungs had forced him to jump. He paced backand forth on the dirt floor until he apparently got his chest under control; hepatted it and with great force ran the palms of his hands from his pectoralmuscles to his stomach as if he were deflating the inner tube of a tire. Hefinally sat down.Don Juan was grinning. His eyes were shining with sheer delight.\"Write your notes,\" he ordered me softly. \"Write. Write or you'll die!\"Then he remarked that even don Genaro no longer felt that my taking notes was sooutlandish.\"That's right!\" don Genaro retorted. \"I've been thinking of taking up writingmyself.\"\"Genaro is a man of knowledge,\" don Juan said dryly. \"And being a man ofknowledge, he's perfectly capable of transporting himself over great distances.\"He reminded me that once, years before, the three of us had been in themountains and that don Genaro, in an effort to help me overcome my stupidreason, had taken a prodigious leap to the peaks of the Sierras ten miles away.I remembered the event, but I also remembered that I could not even conceivethat he had jumped.Don Juan added that don Genaro was capable of performing extraordinary feats atcertain times.\"Genaro at certain times is not Genaro, but his double,\" he said.He repeated it three or four times. Then both of them watched me as if waitingfor my impending reaction.I had not understood what he meant by 'his double'. He had never mentioned thatbefore. I asked for a clarification.\"There is another Genaro,\" he explained.All three of us looked at one another. I became very apprehensive. Don Juanurged me with a movement of his eyes to keep on talking.\"Do you have a twin brother?\" I asked, turning to don Genaro.\"Of course,\" he said. \"I have a twin.\"I could not determine whether or not they were putting me on. They both giggledwith the abandon of children that were pulling a prank.\"You may say,\" don Juan went on, \"that at this moment Genaro is his twin.\"That statement brought both of them to the ground with laughter. But I could notenjoy their mirth. My body shivered involuntarily.Don Juan said in a severe tone that I was too heavy and self-important.\"Let go!\" he commanded me dryly. \"You know that Genaro is a sorcerer and animpeccable warrior. So he's capable of performing deeds that would beunthinkable for the average man. His double, the other Genaro, is one of thosedeeds.\"I was speechless. I could not conceive that they were just teasing me.\"For a warrior like Genaro,\" he went on, \"to produce the other is not such afarfetched enterprise.\"After pondering for a long time what to say next, I asked, \"Is the other likethe self?\"\"The other is the self,\" don Juan replied.His explanation had taken an incredible turn, and yet it was not really moreincredible than anything else they did.\"What's the other made of?\" I asked don Juan after minutes of indecision.\"There is no way of knowing that,\" he said.\"Is it real or just an illusion?\"\"It's real of course.\"\"Would it be possible then to say that it is made of flesh and blood?\" I asked.\"No. It would not be possible,\" don Genaro answered.\"But if it is as real as I am...\"\"As real as you?\" don Juan and don Genaro interjected in unison.They looked at each other and laughed until I thought they were going to getill. Don Genaro threw his hat on the floor and danced around it. His dance wasagile and graceful, and for some inexplicable reason, utterly funny. Perhaps thehumor was in the exquisitely 'professional' movements he executed. Theincongruency was so subtle and at the same time so remarkable that I doubled upwith laughter.\"The trouble with you, Carlitos,\" he said as he sat down again, \"is that you'rea genius.\"\"I have to know about the double,\" I said.\"There's no way of knowing whether he's flesh and blood,\" don Juan said.\"Because he is not as real as you. Genaro's double is as real as Genaro. Do yousee what I mean?\"\"But you have to admit, don Juan, that there must be a way to know.\"\"The double is the self. That explanation should suffice. If you would see,however, you'd know that there is a great difference between Genaro and hisdouble. For a sorcerer who 'sees', the double is brighter.\"I felt I was too weak to ask any more questions. I put my writing pad down, andfor a moment I thought I was going to pass out. I had tunnel vision. Everythingaround me was dark with the exception of a round spot of clear scenery in frontof my eyes.Don Juan said that I had to get some food. I was not hungry.Don Genaro announced that he was famished, stood up, and went to the back of thehouse. Don Juan also stood up, and signaled me to follow. In the kitchen donGenaro gave himself a serving of food, and then became involved in the mostcomical mimicking of a person who wants to eat but can't swallow. I thought thatdon Juan was going to die. He roared, kicked, cried, coughed, and choked withlaughter. I thought I too was going to split my sides. Don Genaro's antics werepriceless.Don Genaro finally gave up and looked at don Juan and me in succession. He hadshiny eyes and a beaming smile.\"It doesn't work,\" he said, shrugging his shoulders.I ate a huge amount of food, and so did don Juan.Then all of us returned to thefront of the house. The sunlight was brilliant, the sky was clear, and themorning breeze sharpened the air. I felt happy and strong.We sat in a triangle facing one another. After a polite silence I decided to askthem to clarify my dilemma. I felt that I was again in top form and wanted toexploit my strength.\"Tell me more about the double, don Juan,\" I said.Don Juan pointed at don Genaro, and don Genaro bowed.\"There he is,\" don Juan said. \"There is nothing to tell. He's here for you towitness him.\"\"But he's don Genaro,\" I said in a feeble attempt to guide the conversation.\"Surely I'm Genaro,\" he said and perked his shoulders.\"What is a double then, don Genaro?\" I asked.\"Ask him,\" he snapped, pointing to don Juan. \"He's the one who talks. I'm dumb.\"\"A double is the sorcerer himself developed through his dreaming,\" don Juanexplained. \"A double is an act of power to a sorcerer but only a tale of powerto you. In the case of Genaro, his double is indistinguishable from theoriginal. That's because his impeccability as a warrior is supreme. Thus you'venever noticed the difference yourself. But in the years that you've known him,you've been with the original Genaro only twice. Every other time you've beenwith his double.\"\"But this is preposterous!\" I exclaimed.I felt an anxiety building up in my chest. I became so agitated that I droppedmy writing pad, and my pencil rolled out of sight. Don Juan and don Genaropractically dove to the ground, and began the most farcical search for it. I hadnever seen a more astonishing performance of theatrical magic and sleight ofhand- except that there was no stage, or props, or any type of gadgetry; andmost likely the performers were not using sleight of hand.Don Genaro, the head magician, and his assistant, don Juan, produced in a matterof minutes the most astounding, bizarre, and outlandish collection of objectswhich they found underneath, or behind, or above every object within theperiphery of the ramada.In the style of stage magic, the assistant set up the props, which in this casewere the few items on the dirt floor: rocks, burlap sacks, pieces of wood, amilk crate, a lantern, and my jacket. Then the magician, don Genaro, wouldproceed to find an object which he would throw away as soon as he had attestedthat it was not my pencil.The collection of objects found included pieces of clothing, wigs, eyeglasses,toys, utensils, pieces of machinery, women's underwear, human teeth, sandwiches,and religious objects. One of them was outright disgusting. It was a piece ofcompact human excrement that don Genaro took from underneath my jacket. Finally,don Genaro found my pencil, and handed it to me after dusting it off with thetail of his shirt.They celebrated their clowning with yells and chuckles. I found myself watching;unable to join them.\"Don't take things so seriously, Carlitos,\" don Genaro said with a tone ofconcern. \"Otherwise you're going to bust a...\"He made a ludicrous gesture that could have meant anything.After their laughter subsided I asked don Genaro what a double did, or what asorcerer did with the double.Don Juan answered. He said that the double had power, and that it was used toaccomplish feats that would be unimaginable under ordinary terms.\"I've told you time and time again that the world is unfathomable,\" he said tome. \"And so are we; and so is every being that exists in this world. It isimpossible, therefore, to reason out the double. You've been allowed to witnessit, though, and that should be more than enough.\"\"But there must be a way to talk about it,\" I said. \"You yourself have told methat you explained your conversation with the deer in order to talk about it.Can't you do the same with the double?\"He was quiet for a moment. I pleaded with him. The anxiety I was experiencingwas beyond anything I had ever gone through.\"Well, a sorcerer can double up,\" don Juan said. \"That's all one can say.\"\"But is he aware that he is doubled?\"\"Of course he's aware of it.\"\"Does he know that he is in two places at once?\"Both of them looked at me and then they exchanged a glance.\"Where is the other don Genaro?\" I asked.Don Genaro leaned towards me and stared into my eyes.\"I don't know,\" he said softly. \"No sorcerer knows where his other is.\"\"Genaro is right,\" don Juan said. \"A sorcerer has no notion that he is in twoplaces at once. To be aware of that would be the equivalent of facing hisdouble, and the sorcerer that finds himself face to face with himself is a deadsorcerer. That is the rule. That is the way power has set things up. No oneknows why.\"Don Juan explained that by the time a warrior had conquered dreaming and seeingand had developed a double, he must have also succeeded in erasing personalhistory, self-importance, and routines.He said that all the techniques which he had taught me, and which I hadconsidered to be empty talk, were in essence means for removing theimpracticality of having a double in the ordinary world; by making the self andthe world fluid, and thereby placing them outside the bounds of prediction.\"A fluid warrior can no longer make the world chronological,\" don Juanexplained. \"And for him, the world and he are no longer objects. He's a luminousbeing existing in a luminous world. The double is a simple affair for a sorcererbecause he knows what he's doing. To take notes is a simple affair for you, butyou still scare Genaro with your pencil.\"\"Can an outsider looking at a sorcerer see that he is in two places at once?\" Iasked don Juan.\"Certainly. That would be the only way to know it.\"\"But can't one logically assume that the sorcerer would also notice that he hasbeen in two places?\"\"Aha!\" don Juan exclaimed. \"For once you've got it right. A sorcerer maycertainly notice afterwards that he has been in two places at once. But this isonly bookkeeping, and has no bearing on the fact that while he's acting he hasno notion of his duality.\"My mind boggled. I felt that if I did not keep on writing I would explode.\"Think of this,\" he went on. \"The world doesn't yield to us directly, thedescription of the world stands in between. So, properly speaking, we are alwaysone step removed, and our experience of the world is always a recollection ofthe experience. We are perennially recollecting the instant that has justhappened; just passed. We recollect, recollect, recollect.\"He turned his hand over and over to give me the feeling of what he meant.\"If our entire experience of the world is recollection, then it's not sooutlandish to conclude that a sorcerer can be in two places at once. This is notthe case from the point of view of his own perception because in order toexperience the world, a sorcerer, like every other man, has to recollect: theact he has just performed, the event he has just witnessed, the experience hehas just lived. In his awareness there is only a single recollection. But for anoutsider looking at the sorcerer, it may appear as if the sorcerer is acting twodifferent episodes at once. The sorcerer, however, recollects two separatesingle instants because the glue of the description of time is no longer bindinghim.\"When don Juan had finished talking I was sure I was running a temperature.Don Genaro examined me with curious eyes.\"He's right,\" he said. \"We're always one jump behind.\"He moved his hand as don Juan had done. His body started to jerk, and he jumpedback on his seat. It was as if he had the hiccups, and the hiccups were forcinghis body to jump back. He began to move backwards jumping on his seat, and wentall the way to the end of the ramada and back.The sight of don Genaro leaping backwards on his buttocks, instead of beingfunny as it should have been, threw me into an attack of fear so intense thatdon Juan had to strike me repeatedly on the top of my head with his knuckles.\"I just can't grasp all this, don Juan,\" I said.\"I can't either,\" don Juan retorted, shrugging his shoulders.\"Neither can I, dear Carlitos,\" don Genaro added.My fatigue, the bulk of my sensory experience, the mood of lightness and humorthat prevailed, and don Genaro's clowning were too much for my nerves. I couldnot stop the agitation in my stomach muscles.Don Juan made me roll on the ground until I had regained my calmness. Then I satdown facing them again.\"Is the double solid?\" I asked don Juan after a long silence.They looked at me.\"Does the double have corporealness?\" I asked.\"Certainly,\" don Juan said. \"Solidity; corporealness are memories. Therefore,like everything else we feel about the world, they are memories we accumulate.Memories of the description. You have the memory of my solidity, the same wayyou have the memory of communicating through words. Thus you talked with acoyote, and you feel me as being solid.\"Don Juan put his shoulder next to mine and nudged me lightly.\"Touch me,\" he said.I patted him and then I embraced him. I was close to tears.Don Genaro stood up and came closer to me. He looked like a small child withshiny mischievous eyes. He puckered up his lips and looked at me for a longmoment.\"What about me?\" he asked, trying to hide a smile. \"Aren't you going to embraceme too?\"I stood up and extended my arms to touch him. My body seemed to freeze on thespot. I had no power to move. I tried to force my arms to reach him, but mystruggle was in vain.Don Juan and don Genaro stood by, watching me. I felt my body contorting underan unknown pressure.Don Genaro sat down, and pretended to sulk because I had not embraced him. Hepouted and hit the ground with his heels. Then both of them exploded into moreroaring laughter.The muscles of my stomach trembled making my whole body shake. Don Juan pointedout that I was moving my head the way he had recommended earlier, and that thatwas the chance to soothe myself by reflecting a beam of light on the cornea ofmy eyes. He forcefully dragged me from under the roof of his ramada to the openfield, and manipulated my body into position so that my eyes would catch theeastern sunlight; but by the time he had put my body in place I had stoppedshivering. I noticed that I was clutching my notebook only after don Genaro saidthat the weight of the sheets was giving me the shivers.I told don Juan that my body was pulling me to leave. I waved my hand to donGenaro. I did not want to give them time to make me change my mind.\"Good-by, don Genaro,\" I yelled. \"I have to go now.\"He waved back at me.Don Juan walked a few yards with me towards my car.\"Do you also have a double, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Of course!\" he exclaimed.I had at that moment a maddening thought. I wanted to discard it and leave in ahurry but something in myself kept on needling me. Over the course of the yearsof our association, it had become customary for me that every time I wanted tosee don Juan I would just go to Sonora or central Mexico, and I would alwaysfind him waiting for me. I had learned to take that for granted, and it hadnever occurred to me until then to think anything of it.\"Tell me something, don Juan,\" I said, half in jest. \"Are you yourself or areyou your double?\"He leaned over towards me. He was grinning.\"My double,\" he whispered.My body leaped in the air as if I had been propelled by a formidable force. Iran to my car.\"I was just kidding,\" don Juan said in a loud voice. \"You can't go yet. Youstill owe me five more days.\"Both of them ran towards my car as I was backing up. They were laughing andjumping up and down.\"Carlitos, call me any time!\" don Genaro shouted.==========================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Dreamer and the Dreamed I drove to don Juan's house and arrived there in the early morning. I had spentthe night in a motel on the way down so I would get to his house before noon.Don Juan was in the back and came to the front when I called him. He gave me awarm greeting and the impression that he was pleased to see me. He made acomment that I thought was intended to put me at ease but produced the oppositeeffect.\"I heard you coming,\" he said as he grinned, \"and I ran to the back. I wasafraid that if I had stayed here you would've been frightened.\"He casually remarked that I was somber and heavy. He said that I reminded him ofEligio who was morbid enough to be a good sorcerer, but too morbid to become aman of knowledge. He added that the only way to counteract the devasting effectof the sorcerers' world was to laugh at it.He was right in his assessment of my mood. I was indeed worried and frightened.We went for a long walk. It took hours for my feelings to ease up. Walking withhim made me feel better than if he had attempted to talk me out of mysomberness.We returned to his house in the late afternoon. I was famished. After eating wesat under his ramada. The sky was clear. The afternoon light made me feelcomplacent. I wanted to talk.\"I've felt uneasy for months,\" I said. \"There was something truly awesome inwhat you and don Genaro said and did the last time I was here.\"Don Juan did not say anything. He got up and moved around the ramada.\"I've got to talk about this,\" I said. \"It obsesses me and I can't stoppondering upon it.\"\"Are you afraid?\" he asked.I told him I was not afraid, but baffled; overwhelmed by what I had heard andwitnessed. The loopholes in my reason were so gigantic that either I had torepair them, or I had to dispose of my reason altogether.My comments made him laugh.\"Don't throw away your reason yet,\" he said. \"It's not time for it. It'll happenthough, but I don't think that now is the moment.\"\"Should I try to find an explanation for what happened, then?\" I asked.\"Certainly!\" he retorted. \"It's your duty to put your mind at ease. Warriors donot win victories by beating their heads against walls, but by overtaking thewalls. Warriors jump over the walls. They don't demolish them.\"\"How can I jump over this one?\" I asked.\"First of all, I think it's deadly wrong for you to regard anything in such aserious fashion,\" he said as he sat down by my side. \"There are three kinds ofbad habits which we use over and over when confronted with unusual lifesituations.\"First, we may disregard what's happening or has happened, and feel as if it hadnever occurred. That one is the bigot's way.\"Second, we may accept everything at its face value and feel as if we knowwhat's going on. That's the pious man's way.\"Third, we may become obsessed with an event because either we cannot disregardit, or we cannot accept it wholeheartedly. That's the fool's way... Your way?There is a fourth; the correct one; the warrior's way. A warrior acts as ifnothing had ever happened, because he doesn't believe in anything. Yet heaccepts everything at its face value. He accepts without accepting, anddisregards without disregarding. He never feels as if he knows. Neither does hefeel as if nothing had ever happened. He acts as if he is in control, eventhough he might be shaking in his boots. To act in such a manner dissipatesobsession.\"We were quiet for a long time. Don Juan's words were like a balm to me.\"Can I talk about don Genaro and his double?\" I asked.\"It depends on what you want to say about him,\" he replied. \"Are you going toindulge in being obsessed?\"\"I want to indulge in explanations,\" I said. \"I'm obsessed because I haven'tdared come to see you, and I haven't been able to talk about my qualms anddoubts with anyone.\"\"Don't you talk with your friends?\"\"I do, but how could they help me?\"\"I never thought that you needed help. You must cultivate the feeling that awarrior needs nothing. You say you need help. Help for what? You have everythingneeded for the extravagant journey that is your life. I have tried to teach youthat the real experience is to be a man, and that what counts is being alive.Life is the little detour that we are taking now. Life in itself is sufficient,self-explanatory, and complete.\"A warrior understands this and lives accordingly. Therefore, one may saywithout being presumptuous that the experience of experiences is being awarrior.\"He seemed to wait for me to say something. I hesitated for a moment. I wanted toselect my words carefully.\"If a warrior needs solace,\" he went on, \"he simply chooses anyone and expressesto that person every detail of his turmoil. After all, the warrior is notseeking to be understood or helped. By talking he's merely relieving himself ofhis pressure; that is, providing that the warrior is given to talking; if he'snot, he tells no one. But you're not living like a warrior altogether. Not yetanyway. And the pitfalls that you encounter must be truly monumental. You haveall my sympathy.\"He was not being facetious. Judging by the concern in his eyes, he seemed to beone who had been there himself. He stood up and patted me on the head. He walkedback and forth the length of the ramada, and looked casually to the chaparralaround the house. His movements evoked a sensation of restlessness in me.In order to relax I began to talk about my dilemma. I felt that it wasinherently too late for me to pretend to be an innocent bystander. Under hisguidance I had trained myself to achieve strange perceptions, such as 'stoppingthe internal dialogue', and controlling my dreams. Those were instances thatcould not be faked.I had followed his suggestions, although never to the letter, and had partiallysucceeded in disrupting daily routines, assuming responsibility for my acts,erasing personal history, and had finally arrived at a point which years beforeI had dreaded. I was capable of being alone without disrupting my physical oremotional well-being.That was perhaps my single most astounding triumph. From the point of view of myformer expectations and moods, to be alone and not 'go out of my mind' was aninconceivable state. I was keenly aware of all the changes that had taken placein my life, and in my view of the world. And I was also aware that it wassomehow superfluous [* superfluous- serving no useful purpose] to be affected soprofoundly by don Juan and don Genaro's revelation about the 'double'.\"What's wrong with me, don Juan?\" I asked.\"You indulge,\" he snapped. \"You feel that indulging in doubts and tribulationsis the sign of a sensitive man. Well, the truth of the matter is that you're thefarthest thing from being sensitive. So why pretend? I told you the other daythat a warrior accepts in humbleness what he is.\"\"You make it sound as if I were confusing myself deliberately,\" I said.\"We do confuse ourselves deliberately,\" he said. \"All of us are aware of ourdoings. Our puny reason deliberately makes itself into the monster it fanciesitself to be. It's too little for such a big mold, though.\"I explained to him that my dilemma was perhaps more complex than what he wasmaking it out to be. I said that as long as he and don Genaro were men likemyself, their superior control made them models for my own behavior. But if theywere in essence men drastically different than I, then I could not conceive ofthem any longer as models but as oddities which I could not possibly aspire toemulate. [* emulate- strive to equal or match by imitating]\"Genaro is a man,\" don Juan said in a reassuring tone. \"He's no longer a manlike yourself, true. But that's his accomplishment. And it shouldn't give riseto fear on your part. If he's different, the more reason to admire him.\"\"But his difference is not a human difference,\" I said.\"And what do you think it is? The difference between a man and a horse?\"\"I don't know. But he's not like me.\"\"He was at one time, though.\"\"But can his change be understood by me?\"\"Of course. You yourself are changing.\"\"Do you mean that I will develop a double?\"\"No one develops a double. That's only a way of talking about it. You, for allthe talking you do, are a sap for words. You get trapped by their meanings. Nowyou think that one develops a double through evil means, I suppose. All of usluminous beings have a double. All of us! A warrior learns to be aware of it,that's all. There are seemingly insurmountable barriers protecting thatawareness. But that's expected. Those barriers are what makes arriving at thatawareness such a unique challenge.\"\"Why am I so afraid of it, don Juan?\"\"Because you're thinking that the double is what the word says; a double, oranother you. I chose those words in order to describe it. The double is oneselfand cannot be faced in any other way.\"\"What if I don't want to have it?\"\"The double is not a matter of personal choice. Neither is it a matter ofpersonal choice who is selected to learn the sorcerers' knowledge that leads tothat awareness. Have you ever asked yourself, why you in particular?\"\"All the time. I've asked you that question hundreds of times, but you've neveranswered it.\"\"I didn't mean that you should ask it as a question that begs an answer, but inthe sense of a warrior's pondering on his great fortune; the fortune of havingfound a challenge.\"To make it into an ordinary question is the device of a conceited ordinary manwho wants to be either admired or pitied for it. I have no interest in that kindof question because there is no way of answering it. The decision of picking youwas a design of power. No one can discern the designs of power. Now that you'vebeen selected there is nothing that you can do to stop the fulfillment of thatdesign.\"\"But you yourself told me, don Juan, that one can always fail.\"\"That's true. One can always fail. But I think that you are referring tosomething else. You want to find a way out. You want to have the freedom to failand quit on your own terms. Too late for that. A warrior is in the hands ofpower and his only freedom is to choose an impeccable life. There is no way tofake triumph or defeat. Your reason may want you to fail altogether in order toobliterate the totality of yourself. But there is a countermeasure which willnot permit you to declare a false victory or defeat. If you think that you canretreat to the haven of failure, you're out of your mind. Your body will standguard and will not let you go either of those ways.\"He began to chuckle softly.\"Why do you laugh?\" I asked.\"You're in a terrible spot,\" he said. \"It's too late for you to retreat but toosoon to act. All you can do is witness. You're in the miserable position of aninfant who cannot return to the mother's womb, but neither can he run around andact. All an infant can do is witness; and listen to the stupendous tales ofaction being told to him. You are at that precise point now. You cannot go backto the womb of your old world, but you cannot act with power either. For youthere is only witnessing acts of power and listening to tales; tales of power.\"The double is one of those tales. You know that, and that's why your reason isso taken by it. You are beating your head against a wall if you pretend tounderstand. All that I can say about it, by way of explanation, is that thedouble, although it is arrived at through dreaming, is as real as it can be.\"\"According to what you've told me, don Juan, the double can perform acts. Canthe double then...?\"He did not let me continue with my line of reasoning. He reminded me that it wasinappropriate to say that he had told me about the double, when I could say thatI had witnessed it.\"Obviously the double can perform acts,\" I said.\"Obviously!\" he replied.\"But can the double act in behalf of the self?\"\"It is the self, damn it!\"I found it very difficult to explain myself. I had in mind that if a sorcerercould perform two actions at once, his capacity for utilitarian production hadto double. He could work two jobs, be in two places, see two persons, and so on,at once.Don Juan listened patiently.\"Let me put it this way,\" I said. \"Hypothetically, can don Genaro kill someonehundreds of miles away by letting his double do it?\"Don Juan looked at me. He shook his head and moved his eyes away.\"You're filled with tales of violence,\" he said. \"Genaro cannot kill anyone,simply because he no longer has any interest in his fellow men. By the time awarrior is capable of conquering seeing and dreaming, and having the awarenessof his luminosity, there is no such interest left in him.\"I pointed out that at the beginning of my apprenticeship he had made thestatement that a sorcerer, aided by his 'ally', could be transported overhundreds of miles to deliver a blow to his enemies.\"I am responsible for your confusion,\" he said. \"But you must remember that onanother occasion I told you that, with you, I was not following the steps my ownteacher prescribed. He was a sorcerer, and I should've properly plunged you intothat world. I didn't because I am no longer concerned with the ups and downs ofmy fellow men. Yet, my teacher's words stuck with me. I talked to you many timesin the manner he himself would have talked.\"Genaro is a man of knowledge. The purest of them all. His actions areimpeccable. He's beyond ordinary men; and beyond sorcerers. His double is anexpression of his joy and his humor. Thus he cannot possibly use it to create orresolve ordinary situations. As far as I know, the double is the awareness ofour state as luminous beings. It can do anything, and yet it chooses to beunobtrusive and gentle.\"It was my error to mislead you with borrowed words. My teacher was not capableof producing the effects Genaro does. For my teacher, unfortunately, certainthings were, as they are for you, only tales of power.\"I was compelled to defend my point. I said that I was speaking in a hypotheticalsense.\"There is no hypothetical sense when you speak about the world of men ofknowledge,\" he said. \"A man of knowledge cannot possibly act towards his fellowmen in injurious terms; hypothetically or otherwise.\"\"But, what if his fellow men are plotting against his security and well-being?Can he then use his double to protect himself?\"He clicked his tongue in disapproval.\"What incredible violence in your thoughts,\" he said. \"No one can plot againstthe security and well-being of a man of knowledge. He 'sees'. Therefore he wouldtake steps to avoid anything like that. Genaro, for example, has taken acalculated risk in joining you. But there is nothing that you could do toendanger his security. If there is anything, his 'seeing' will let him know.Now, if there is something about you that is inherently injurious to him, andhis 'seeing' cannot reach it, then it is his fate and neither Genaro nor anyoneelse can avoid that. So you see, a man of knowledge is in control withoutcontrolling anything.\"We were quiet. The sun was about to reach the top of the heavy tall bushes onthe west side of the house. There were about two hours of daylight left.\"Why don't you call Genaro?\" don Juan said casually.My body jumped. My initial reaction was to drop everything and run for my car.Don Juan broke into a belly laugh. I told him that I did not have to proveanything to myself, and that I was perfectly content to talk to him. Don Juancould not stop laughing. Finally he said that it was a shame that don Genaro wasnot there to enjoy a great scene.\"Look. If you're not interested in calling Genaro, I am,\" he said in a resolutetone. \"I like his company.\"I had a terrible sour taste on the roof of my mouth. Beads of perspiration randown from my brow and my upper lip. I wanted to say something but there wasreally nothing to say.Don Juan gave me a long, scrutinizing look.\"Come on,\" he said. \"A warrior is always ready. To be a warrior is not a simplematter of wishing to be one. It is rather an endless struggle that will go on tothe very last moment of our lives. Nobody is born a warrior, in exactly the sameway that nobody is born a reasonable being. We make ourselves into one or theother.\"Pull yourself together. I don't want Genaro to see you shivering like this.\"He stood up, and paced back and forth on the clean floor of the ramada. I couldnot remain impassive. My nervousness was so intense that I could not write anymore, and I jumped to my feet.Don Juan made me jog on the spot facing the west. He had made me perform thesame movements before on various occasions. The idea was to draw 'power' fromthe impending twilight by raising one's arms to the sky with the fingersstretched like a fan, and then clasp them forcefully when the arms were in themid point between the horizon and the zenith.The exercise worked, and I became almost instantly calm and collected. I couldnot avoid wondering, however, what had happened to the old 'me' that could neverhave relaxed so completely by performing those simple and idiotic movements.I wanted to focus all my attention on the procedure that don Juan wasdoubtlessly going to follow to call don Genaro. I anticipated some portentousacts. Don Juan stood on the edge of the ramada facing the southeast, cupped hishands around his mouth, and yelled, \"Genaro! Come here!\"A moment later don Genaro emerged from the chaparral. Both of them were beaming.They practically danced in front of me.Don Genaro greeted me effusively and then sat down on the milk crate.There was something dreadfully wrong with me. I was calm; unruffled. Someincredible state of indifference and aloofness had taken over my entire being.It was almost as if I were watching myself from a hiding place.In a very nonchalant manner I proceeded to tell don Genaro that during my lastvisit he had nearly scared me to death, and that not even during my experienceswith psychotropic plants had I been in such a complete state of chaos. Both ofthem celebrated my statements as if they were meant to be funny. I laughed withthem.They obviously were aware of my state of emotional numbness. They watched me andhumored me as if I were drunk.There was something inside me that fought desperately to turn the situation intosomething familiar. I wanted to be concerned and afraid.Don Juan finally splashed some water on my face, and urged me to sit down andtake notes. He said, as he had done before, that either I took notes or I died.The mere act of putting down some words brought back my familiar mood. It was asif something became crystal clear again; something that a moment before had beenopaque and numb.The advent of my usual self also meant the advent of my usual fears. Strangelyenough, I was less afraid of being afraid than of being unafraid. Thefamiliarity of my old habits, no matter how unpleasant they were, was adelightful respite.I fully realized then that don Genaro had just emerged from the chaparral. Myusual processes were beginning to function. I started by refusing to think orspeculate about the event. I made the resolution of not asking him anything. Iwas going to be a silent witness this time.\"Genaro has come again exclusively for you,\" don Juan said.Don Genaro was leaning against the wall of the house, and was resting his backagainst it while he sat on a tilted milk crate. He looked as if he were ridingon horseback. His hands were in front of him which gave the impression that hewas holding the reins of a horse.\"That's right, Carlitos,\" he said and brought the milk crate to rest on theground.He dismounted, whirling his right leg over an imaginary neck of a horse, andthen jumped to the ground. His movements were so perfectly executed that he gaveme the unquestionable sensation that he had arrived on horseback. He came to myside and sat down to my left.\"Genaro has come because he wants to tell you about the other,\" don Juan said.He made a gesture of giving don Genaro the floor. Don Genaro bowed. He turnedslightly to face me.\"What would you like to know, Carlitos?\" he asked in a high-pitched voice.\"Well, if you're going to tell me about the double, tell me everything,\" I said,feigning casualness.Both of them shook their heads and glanced at each other.\"Genaro is going to tell you about the dreamer and the dreamed,\" don Juan said.\"As you know, Carlitos,\" don Genaro said with the air of an orator warming up,\"the double begins in dreaming.\"He gave me a long look and smiled. His eyes swept from my face to my notebookand pencil.\"The double is a dream,\" he said, scratched his arms and then stood up.He walked to the edge of the ramada and stepped out into the chaparral. He stoodby a bush showing three fourths of his profile to us. He was apparentlyurinating. After a moment I noticed that there seemed to be something wrong withhim. He appeared to be trying desperately to urinate but could not. Don Juan'slaughter was the clue that don Genaro was clowning again. Don Genaro contortedhis body in such a comical fashion that he had don Juan and me practically inhysterics.Don Genaro came back to the ramada and sat down. His smile radiated a rarewarmth.\"When you can't, you just can't,\" he said and shrugged his shoulders.Then after a moment's pause he added, sighing, \"Yes, Carlitos, the double is adream.\"\"Do you mean that he's not real?\" I asked.\"No. I mean that he is a dream,\" he retorted.Don Juan intervened and explained that don Genaro was referring to the firstemergence of the awareness that we are luminous beings.\"Each one of us is different, and thus the details of our struggles aredifferent,\" don Juan said. \"The steps that we follow to arrive at the double arethe same, though. Especially the beginning steps- which are muddled anduncertain.\"Don Genaro agreed and made a comment on the uncertainty that a sorcerer had atthat stage.\"When it first happened to me, I didn't know it had happened,\" he explained.\"One day I had been picking plants in the mountains. I had gone into a placethat was worked by other herb collectors. I had two huge sacks of plants. I wasready to go home, but before I did I decided to take a moment's rest.\"I lay down on the side of the trail in the shade of a tree and I fell asleep. Iheard then the sound of people coming down the hill and woke up. I hurriedly ranfor cover and hid behind some bushes a short distance across the road from whereI had fallen asleep. While I hid there I had the nagging impression I hadforgotten something. I looked to see if I had my two sacks of plants. I didn'thave them.\"I looked across the road to the place where I had been sleeping and I nearlydropped my pants with fright. I was still there asleep! It was me! I touched mybody. I was myself!\"By that time the people that were coming down the hill were upon the me thatwas asleep, while the me that was fully awake looked helplessly from my hidingplace. Darn it! They were going to find me there and take my sacks away. Butthey went by me as if I were not there at all.\"My vision had been so vivid that I went wild. I screamed and then I woke upagain. Darn it! It had been a dream!\"Don Genaro stopped his account and looked at me as if waiting for a question ora comment.\"Tell him where you woke up the second time,\" don Juan said.\"I woke up by the road,\" don Genaro said, \"where I had fallen asleep. But forone moment I didn't quite know where I really was. I can almost say that I wasstill looking at myself waking up, then something pulled me to the side of theroad and I found myself rubbing my eyes.\"There was a long pause. I did not know what to say.\"And what did you do next?\" don Juan asked.I realized, when both of them began to laugh, that he was teasing me. He wasimitating my questions.Don Genaro went on talking. He said that he was stunned for a moment and thenwent to check everything.\"The place where I had hid was there exactly as I had seen it,\" he said. \"Andthe people who had walked by me were down the road a short distance away. I knowit because I ran downhill after them. They were the same people I had seen. Ifollowed them until they got to town. They must have thought I was mad. I askedthem if they had seen my friend sleeping by the side of the road. They all saidthey hadn't.\"\"You see,\" don Juan said, \"all of us go through the same doubts. We are afraidof being mad. Unfortunately for us, of course, all of us are already mad.\"\"You are a tinge madder than us, though,\" don Genaro said to me and winked. \"Andmore suspicious.\"They teased me about my suspiciousness. And then don Genaro began to talk again.\"All of us are dense beings,\" he said. \"You're not the only one, Carlitos. I wasa bit shook up by my dream for a couple of days, but then I had to work for myliving and take care of too many things and really had no time for ponderingupon the mystery of my dreams. So I forgot about it in no time at all. I wasvery much like you.\"But one day, a few months later, after a terribly tiring day, I fell asleeplike a log in midafternoon. It had just started to rain and a leak in the roofwoke me up. I jumped out of bed and climbed on top of the house to fix the leakbefore it began to pour. I felt so fine and strong that I finished in one minuteand I didn't even get wet. I thought that the snooze I had taken had done me alot of good.\"When I was through I went back into the house to get something to eat and Irealized that I could not swallow. I thought I was sick. I mashed some roots andleaves, and wrapped them around my neck, and went to my bed.\"And then again when I got to my bed I nearly dropped my pants. I was there inbed asleep! I wanted to shake myself and wake me up, but I knew that that wasnot the thing one should do. So I ran out of the house. I was panic-stricken. Iroamed around the hills aimlessly. I had no idea where I was going, and althoughI had lived all my life there I got lost. I walked in the rain and didn't evenfeel it. It seemed that I couldn't think. Then the lightning and thunder becameso intense that I woke up again.\"He paused for a moment.\"Do you want to know where I woke up?\" he asked me.\"Certainly,\" don Juan answered.\"I woke up in the hills in the rain,\" he said.\"But how did you know that you had woken up?\" I asked.\"My body knew it,\" he replied.\"That was a stupid question,\" don Juan interjected. \"You yourself know thatsomething in the warrior is always aware of every change. It is precisely theaim of the warrior's way to foster and maintain that awareness. The warriorcleans it, shines it, and keeps it running.\"He was right. I had to admit to them that I knew that there was something in methat registered and was aware of everything I did. And yet it had nothing to dowith the ordinary awareness of myself. It was something else which I could notpin down. I told them that perhaps don Genaro could describe it better than I.\"You're doing very well yourself,\" don Genaro said. \"It's an inner voice thattells you what's what. And at that time it told me that I had woken up a secondtime. Of course, as soon as I woke up I became convinced that I must have beendreaming. Obviously it had not been an ordinary dream, but it hadn't beendreaming proper either. So I settled for something else; walking in my sleep,half awake, I suppose. I could not understand it in any other way.\"Don Genaro said that his benefactor had explained to him that what he had gonethrough was not a dream at all, and that he should not insist on regarding it aswalking in his sleep.\"What did he tell you that it was?\" I asked.They exchanged a glance.\"He told me it was the bogeyman,\" don Genaro replied, affecting the tone of asmall child.I explained to them that I wanted to know if don Genaro's benefactor explainedthings in the same way they themselves did.\"Of course he did,\" don Juan said.\"My benefactor explained that the dream in which one was watching oneselfasleep,\" don Genaro went on, \"was the time of the double. He recommended thatrather than wasting my power in wondering and asking myself questions, I shoulduse the opportunity to act; and that when I had another chance I should beprepared.\"My next chance took place at my benefactor's house. I was helping him with thehousework. I had lain down to rest and as usual I fell sound asleep. His housewas definitely a place of power for me and helped me.I was suddenly aroused by a loud noise and awakened. My benefactor's house waslarge. He was a wealthy man and had many people working for him. The noiseseemed to be the sound of a shovel digging in gravel. I sat up to listen andthen I stood up. The noise was very unsettling to me but I couldn't figure outwhy.I was pondering whether to go and check it out when I noticed that I was asleepon the floor. This time I knew what to expect and what to do; and I followed thenoise. I walked to the back of the house. There was no one there. The noiseseemed to come from beyond the house. I kept on following it. The more Ifollowed it the quicker I could move. I ended up at a distant place, witnessingincredible things.\"He explained that at the time of those events he still was in the beginningstages of his apprenticeship and had done very little in the realm of'dreaming', but that he had an uncanny facility to dream that he was looking athimself.\"Where did you go, don Genaro?\" I asked.\"That was the first time that I had really moved in dreaming\" he said. \"I knewenough about it to behave correctly, though. I didn't look at anything directlyand ended up in a deep ravine where my benefactor had some of his power plants.\"\"Do you think it works better if one knows very little about dreaming?\" I asked.\"No!\" don Juan interjected. \"Each of us has a facility for something inparticular. Genaro's knack is for dreaming.\"\"What did you see in the ravine, don Genaro?\" I asked.\"I saw my benefactor doing some dangerous maneuvers with people. I thought I wasthere to help him and hid behind some trees. Yet I couldn't have known how tohelp. I was not dumb though, and I realized that the scene was there for me towatch; not to act in.\"\"When and how and where did you wake up?\"\"I don't know when I woke up. It must have been hours later. All I know is thatI followed my benefactor and the other men. And when they were about to reach mybenefactor's house, the noise that they made, because they were arguing, woke meup. I was at the place where I had seen myself asleep.\"Upon waking up, I realized that whatever I had seen and done was not a drearn.I had actually gone some distance away guided by the sound.\"\"Was your benefactor aware of what you were doing?\"\"Certainly. He had been making the noise with the shovel to help me accomplishmy task. When he walked into the house he pretended to scold me for fallingasleep. I knew that he had seen me. Later on, after his friends had left, hetold me that he had noticed my glow hiding behind the trees.\"Don Genaro said that those three instances set him off on the path of'dreaming', and that it took him fifteen years to have his next chance.\"The fourth time was a more bizarre and a more complete vision,\" he said. \"Ifound myself asleep in the middle of a cultivated field. I saw myself lyingthere on my side sound asleep. I knew that it was dreaming because I had setmyself to do dreaming every night.\"Usually, every time I had seen myself asleep, I was at the site where I hadgone to sleep. This time I was not in my bed, and I knew I had gone to bed thatnight. In this dreaming it was daytime.\"So, I began to explore. I moved away from the place where I was lying andoriented myself. I knew where I was. I was actually not too far from my house;perhaps a couple of miles away. I walked around looking at every detail of theplace. I stood in the shade of a big tree a short distance away and peeredacross a flat strip of land to some corn fields on the side of a hill.\"Something quite unusual struck me then. The details of the surroundings did notchange or vanish no matter how long I peered at them. I got scared and ran backto where I was sleeping. I was still there exactly as I had been before. I beganto watch myself. I had an eerie feeling of indifference towards the body I waswatching.\"Then I heard the sound of people approaching. People always seemed to be aroundfor me. I ran up ahead to a small hill and carefully watched from there. Therewere ten people coming to the field where I was. They were all young men.\"I ran back to where I was lying, and went through one of the most agonizingtimes of my life while I faced myself lying there snoring like a pig. I knewthat I had to awaken me, but I had no idea how. I also knew that it was deadlyfor me to awaken myself. But if those young men were to find me there they weregoing to be very upset.\"All those deliberations that were going through my mind were not reallythoughts. They were more appropriately scenes in front of my eyes. My worrying,for instance, was a scene in which I looked at myself while I had the sensationof being boxed in. I call that worrying. It has happened to me a number of timesafter that first time.\"Well, since I didn't know what to do, I stood looking at myself,and waited forthe worst. A bunch of fleeting images went past me in front of my eyes. I hungon to one in particular; the sight of my house and my bed. The image became veryclear. Oh, how I wished to be back in my bed!\"Something shook me then. It felt like someone was hitting me and I woke up. Iwas on my bed! Obviously, I had been dreaming. I jumped out of bed, and ran tothe place of my dreaming. It was exactly as I had seen it. The young men wereworking there. I watched them for a long time. They were the same ones I hadseen.\"I came back to the same place at the end of the day after everybody had gone,and stood at the very spot where I had seen myself asleep. Someone had lainthere. The weeds were crumpled,\"Don Juan and don Genaro were observing me. They looked like two strange animals.I felt a shiver in my back. I was on the verge of indulging in the very rationalfear that they were not really men like myself, but don Genaro laughed.\"In those days,\" he said, \"I was just like you, Carlitos. I wanted to checkeverything. I was as suspicious as you are.\"He paused, raised his finger, and shook it at me. Then he faced don Juan.\"Weren't you as suspicious as this guy?\" he asked.\"Not a chance,\" don Juan said. \"He's the champ.\"Don Genaro turned to me and made a gesture of apology.\"I think I was wrong,\" he said. \"I was not as suspicious as you.\"They chuckled softly as if they did not want to make noise. Don Juan's bodyconvulsed with muffled laughter.\"This is a place of power for you,\" don Genaro said in a whisper. \"You'vewritten your fingers off right where you are sitting. Have you ever done someheavy dreaming here?\"\"No he hasn't,\" don Juan said in a low voice. \"But he's done some heavywriting.\"They doubled up. It seemed that they did not want to laugh out loud. Theirbodies shook. Their soft laughter was like a rhythmical cackle.Don Genaro sat up straight and slid closer to me. He patted me on the shoulderrepeatedly, and said that I was a rascal. Then he pulled my left arm with greatforce towards him. I lost my balance and fell forward. I almost hit my face onthe hard ground. I automatically put my right arm in front and buffered my fall.One of them held me down by pressing on my neck. I was not sure who. The handthat was holding me felt like don Genaro's. I had a moment of devastating panic.I felt I was fainting. Perhaps I did. The pressure in my stomach was so intensethat I vomited.My next clear perception was that somebody was helping me to sit up. Don Genarowas squatting in front of me. I turned around to look for don Juan. He wasnowhere in sight. Don Genaro had a beaming smile. His eyes were shiny. They werelooking fixedly at mine.I asked him what he had done to me, and he said that I was in pieces. His tonewas reproachful, and he seemed to be annoyed or dissatisfied with me. Herepeated various times that I was in pieces and that I had to come togetheragain. He tried to feign a severe tone, but he laughed in the middle of hisharangue. [* harangue- a loud bombastic speech expressed with strong emotion] Hewas telling me that it was just terrible that I was spread all over the place,and that he would have to use a broom to sweep all my pieces into one heap.Then he added that I might get the pieces in the wrong places and end up with mypenis where my thumb should be. He cracked up at that point. I wanted to laughand had a most unusual sensation. My body fell apart! It was as if I had been amechanical toy that simply broke up into pieces. I had no physical feelingswhatever, and neither had I any fear or concern. Coming apart was a scene that Iwitnessed from the point of view of the perceiver, and yet I did not perceiveanything from a sensorial point of reference.The next thing I became aware of was that don Genaro was manipulating my body. Ithen had a physical sensation; a vibration so intense that it made me lose sightof everything around me.I felt once more that someone was helping me to sit up. I again saw don Genarosquatting in front of me. He pulled me up by my armpits and helped me walkaround. I could not figure out where I was. I had the feeling I was in a dream,and yet I had a complete sense of sequential time. I was keenly aware that I hadjust been with don Genaro and don Juan in the ramada of don Juan's house.Don Genaro walked with me; propping me by holding my left armpit. The scenery Iwas watching changed constantly. I could not determine, however, the nature ofwhat I was observing. What was in front of my eyes was rather like a feeling ora mood, and the center from where all those changes radiated was definitely inmy stomach.I had made that connection not as a thought or a realization, but as a bodilysensation that suddenly became fixed and predominant. The fluctuations around mecame from my stomach. I was creating a world; an endless run of feelings andimages. Everything I knew was there. That in itself was a feeling, not a thoughtor a conscious assessment.I tried to keep tabs for a moment because of my nearly invincible habit ofassessing everything. But at a certain instant my processes of bookkeepingceased, and a nameless something enveloped me; feelings and images of everysort.At one point something in me began again the tabulation, and I noticed that oneimage kept on repeating itself; don Juan and don Genaro- who were trying toreach me. The image was fleeting. It passed by me fast. It was somethingcomparable to seeing them from the window of a fast-moving vehicle. They seemedto be trying to catch me as I went by. The image became clearer and it lastedlonger as it kept on recurring.I consciously realized at one point that I was deliberately isolating it fromamong a myriad of other images. I sort of breezed through the rest to come tothat particular scene.Finally I was capable of sustaining it by thinking about it. Once I had begun tothink, my ordinary processes took over. They were not as defined as in myordinary activities, but clear enough to know that the scene or feeling I hadisolated was that of don Juan and don Genaro in the ramada of don Juan's house,and they were holding me by the armpits.I wanted to keep on fleeing through other images and feelings, but they wouldnot let me. I struggled for a moment. I felt bouncy and happy. I knew that Iliked both of them, and I also knew then that I was not afraid of them.I wanted to joke with them but I did not know how, and I kept on laughing andpatting them on their shoulders. I had another peculiar awareness. I was certainthat I was 'dreaming'. If I focused my eyes on anything, it immediately becameblurry.Don Juan and don Genaro were talking to me. I could not keep their wordsstraight, and I could not distinguish which of them was talking.Don Juan then turned my body around and pointed to a lump on the ground. DonGenaro pulled me closer to it and made me go around it. The lump was a man lyingon the ground. He was lying on his stomach with his face turned to his right.They kept on pointing out the man to me as they spoke. They pulled me andtwisted me around him. I could not focus my eyes on him at all, but finally Ihad a feeling of quietness and sobriety and I looked at the man.I had a slow awakening into the realization that the man lying on the ground wasme. My realization did not bring any terror or discomfort. I simply accepted itwithout emotion. At that moment I was not completely asleep, but neither was Icompletely awake and in sober consciousness.I also became more aware of don Juan and don Genarom, and could tell them apartwhen they talked to me. Don Juan said that we were going to go to the roundpower place in the chaparral. As soon as he said it the image of the placepopped in my mind. I saw the dark masses of bushes around it. I turned to myright. Don Juan and don Genaro were also there. I had a jolt and the feelingthat I was afraid of them. Perhaps because they looked like two menacingshadows. They came closer to me. As soon as I saw their features my fearsvanished. I liked them again.It was as if I were drunk and did not have a firm grip on anything. They grabbedme by the shoulders and shook me in unison. They ordered me to wake up. I couldhear their voices clearly and separately. I had then a unique moment. I held twoimages in my mind, two dreams. I felt that something in me was deeply asleep andwas waking up and I found myself lying on the floor of the ramada with don Juanand don Genaro shaking me. But I also was at the power place and don Juan anddon Genaro were still shaking me.There was one crucial instant in which I was neither in one place nor the other,but I was rather in both places as an observer seeing two scenes at once. I hadthe incredible sensation that at that instant I could have gone either way. AllI had to do at that moment was to change perspective; and rather than watcheither scene from the outside, feel it from the point of view of the subject.There was something very warm about don Juan's house. I preferred that scene.I next had a terrifying seizure so shocking that my entire ordinary awarenesscame back to me at once. Don Juan and don Genaro were pouring buckets of wateron me. I was in the ramada of don Juan's house.Hours later we sat in the kitchen. Don Juan had insisted that I had to proceedas if nothing had happened. He gave me some food and said that I had to eat agreat deal to compensate for my expenditure of energy.It was after nine in the evening when I looked at my watch after we had sat downto eat. My experience had lasted several hours. From the point of view of myrecollection, however, it seemed that I had just fallen asleep for a shortwhile.Even though I was completely myself, I still was numb. It was not until I hadbegun to write in my notebook that I regained my usual awareness. It was asurprise to me that taking notes could bring about instantaneous sobriety. Themoment I was myself again, a barrage of reasonable thoughts immediately came tomy mind. Those thoughts purported [* purported- accepted as true on inconclusivegrounds] to explain the phenomenon I had experienced. I 'knew' on the spot thatdon Genaro had hypnotized me the moment he pinned me down on the ground, but Idid not attempt to figure out how he had done it.They both laughed hysterically when I expressed my thoughts. Don Genaro examinedmy pencil and said that the pencil was the key to wind up my mainspring. I feltquite belligerent. I was tired and irritable. I found myself practically yellingat them while their bodies shook with laughter.Don Juan said that it was permissible to miss the boat, but not by such a widemargin; and that don Genaro had come exclusively to help me and show me themystery of the dreamer and the dreamed.My irritability came to a peak. Don Juan signaled don Genaro with a movement ofhis head. Both of them stood and took me around the house. There don Genarodemonstrated his great repertoire of animal grunts and cries. He asked me tochoose one and he taught me how to reproduce it.After hours of practice I got to the point where I could imitate it quite well.The end result was that they themselves had enjoyed my clumsy attempts andlaughed until they were practically weeping; and I had released my tension byreproducing the loud cry of an animal. I told them that there was somethingtruly awesome in my imitation. The relaxation of my body was unequaled.Don Juan said that if I would perfect the cry I could turn it into an affair ofpower, or I could simply use it to relieve my tension whenever I needed to. Hesuggested I should go to sleep, but I was afraid to fall asleep. I sat with themby the kitchen fire for a while and then, quite unintentionally, I fell into adeep sleep.I woke up at dawn. Don Genaro was sleeping by the door. He seemingly woke up atthe same time I did. They had covered me up and folded my jacket as a pillow. Ifelt very calm and rested. I commented to don Genaro that I had felt exhaustedthe night before. He said that so had he. He whispered as if he were confidingin me and told me that don Juan was even more exhausted because he was older.\"You and I are young,\" he said with a glint in his eyes. \"But he's old. He mustbe about three hundred now.\"I sat up hurriedly. Don Genaro covered his face with his blanket and roared withlaughter. Don Juan came into the room at that moment.I had a feeling of completeness and peace. For once, nothing really mattered. Iwas so at ease that I wanted to weep.Don Juan said that the night before I had begun to be aware of my luminosity. Headmonished [* admonish- warn strongly to put on guard] me not to indulge in thesense of well-being I was having because it would turn into complacency.\"At this moment,\" I said, \"I don't want to explain anything. It doesn't matterwhat don Genaro did to me last night.\"\"I didn't do anything to you,\" don Genaro retorted. \"Look, it's me, Genaro. YourGenaro! Touch me!\"I embraced don Genaro and we both laughed like two children.He asked me if I thought it was strange that I could embrace him then when lasttime I had seen him there I had been unable to touch him. I assured him thatthose issues were no longer pertinent to me.Don Juan's comment was that I was indulging in being broad-minded and good.\"Watch out!\" he said. \"A warrior never lets his guard down. If you keep on beingso happy you're going to drain the little power you have left.\"\"What should I do?\" I asked.\"Be yourself,\" he said. \"Doubt everything. Be suspicious.\"\"But I don't like to be that way, don Juan.\"\"It is not a matter of whether you like it or not. What matters is; what can youuse as a shield? A warrior must use everything available to him to close hismortal gap once it opens. So it's of no importance that you really don't like tobe suspicious or ask questions. That's your only shield now.\"Write. Write or you'll die. To die with elation is a crappy way of dying.\"\"How should a warrior die, then?\" don Genaro asked in exactly my own tone ofvoice.\"A warrior dies the hard way,\" don Juan said. \"His death must struggle to takehim. A warrior does not give himself to it.\"Don Genaro opened his eyes to an enormous size, and then blinked.\"What Genaro showed you yesterday is of utmost importance,\" don Juan went on.\"You can't slough it off with piousness. Yesterday you told me that you had beendriven wild with the idea of the double. But look at you now. You don't care anymore.\"That's the trouble with people that go wild. They go wild both ways. Yesterdayyou were all questions. Today you are all acceptance.\"I pointed out that he always found a flaw in what I did, regardless of how I didit.\"That's not true!\" he exclaimed. \"There is no flaw in the warrior's way. Followit and your acts cannot be criticized by anyone. Take yesterday as an example.The warrior's way would have been, first, to ask questions without fear andwithout suspicion, and then let Genaro show you the mystery of the dreamer;without fighting him, or draining yourself. Today the warrior's way would be toassemble what you've learned without presumptuousness and without piousness. Dothat and no one can find flaws in it.\"I thought by his tone that don Juan must have been terribly annoyed with myblunderings. But he smiled at me and then giggled as if his own words had madehim laugh.I told him that I was just holding back; not wanting to burden them with myprobes. I was indeed overwhelmed by what don Genaro had done. I had beenconvinced, although it no longer mattered, that don Genaro had been waiting inthe bushes for don Juan to call him. Then later on he had cashed in on my frightand used it to stun me. After being held forcibly on the ground I must haveundoubtedly passed out, and then don Genaro must have mesmerized me.Don Juan argued that I was too strong to be subdued that easily.\"What took place then?\" I asked him.\"Genaro came to see you to tell you something very exclusive,\" he said. \"When hecame out of the bushes, he was Genaro the double. There is another way to talkabout this that would explain it better, but I can't use it now.\"\"Why not, don Juan?\"\"Because you are not ready yet to talk about the totality of oneself. For thetime being I can only say that this Genaro here is not the double now.\"He pointed to don Genaro with a movement of his head. Don Genaro blinkedrepeatedly.\"The Genaro of last night was the double. And as I told you already, the doublehas inconceivable power. He showed you a most important issue. In order to dothat he had to touch you. The double simply tapped you on the neck on the samespot the ally walked over you years ago. Naturally you went out like a light.And naturally too, you indulged like a son of a bitch. It took us hours to roundyou up. Thus you dissipated your power; and when the time came for you toaccomplish a warrior's feat you did not have enough sap.\"\"What was that warrior's feat, don Juan?\"\"I told you that Genaro came to show you something; the mystery of luminousbeings as dreamers. You wanted to know about the double. It begins in dreams.But then you asked, 'What is the double?' And I said the double is the self. Theself dreams the double. That should be simple, except that there is nothingsimple about us.\"Perhaps the ordinary dreams of the self are simple, but that doesn't mean thatthe self is simple. Once it has learned to dream the double, the self arrives atthis weird crossroad, and a moment comes when one realizes that it is the doublewho dreams the self.\"I had written down everything he had said. I had also paid attention to what hewas saying, but had failed to understand him.Don Juan repeated his statements.\"The lesson last night, as I told you, was about the dreamer and the dreamed; orwho dreams whom.\"\"I beg your pardon,\" I said.Both of them broke into laughter.\"Last night,\" don Juan proceeded, \"you almost chose to wake up at the powerplace.\"\"What do you mean, don Juan?\"\"That would have been the feat. If you had not indulged in your stupid ways, youwould have had enough power to tip the scales; and you would've, no doubt,scared yourself to death. Fortunately, or unfortunately, as the case may be, youdid not have enough power. In fact, you wasted your power in worthless confusionto the point that you almost didn't have enough to survive.\"So, as you may very well understand, to indulge in your little quirks is notonly stupid and wasteful, but also injurious. A warrior that drains himselfcannot live. The body is not an indestructible affair. You might have gottengravely ill. You didn't simply because Genaro and I deviated some of your crap.\"The full impact of his words was beginning to take hold of me.\"Last night Genaro guided you through the intricacies of the double,\" don Juanwent on. \"Only he can do that for you. And it was not a vision or ahallucination when you saw yourself lying on the ground. You could have realizedthat with infinite clarity if you had not gotten lost in your indulging. And youcould have known then that you yourself are a dream; that your double isdreaming you in the same fashion that you dreamed him last night.\"\"But how can that be possible, don Juan?\"\"No one knows how it happens. We only know that it does happen. That's themystery of us as luminous beings. Last night you had two dreams and you couldhave awakened in either one, but you didn't have enough power even to understandthat.\"They looked at me fixedly for a moment.\"I think he understands,\" don Genaro said. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Secret of the Luminous Beings Don Genaro delighted me for hours with some preposterous instructions on how tomanage my daily world. Don Juan said that I should be very careful andserious-minded about the recommendations made by don Genaro because, althoughthey were funny, they were not a joke.Around noon don Genaro stood up and without saying a word walked into thebushes. I was also going to get up, but don Juan gently held me down and in asolemn voice announced that don Genaro was going to try one more thing with me.\"What's he up to?\" I asked. \"What is he going to do to me?\"Don Juan assured me that I did not have to worry.\"You are approaching a crossroad,\" he said. \"A certain crossroad that everywarrior comes to.\"I had the idea that he was talking about my death. He seemed to anticipate myquestion and signaled me not to say anything.\"We won't discuss this matter,\" he said. \"Suffice it to say that the crossroadI'm referring to is the sorcerers' explanation. Genaro believes you're ready forit.\"\"When are you going to tell me about it?\"\"I don't know when. You are the recipient, therefore it is up to you. You willhave to decide when.\"\"What's wrong with right now?\"\"To decide doesn't mean to choose an arbitrary time,\" he said. \"To decide meansthat you have trimmed your spirit impeccably, and that you have done everythingpossible to be worthy of knowledge and power.\"Today, however, you must solve a little riddle for Genaro. He's gone ahead ofus and he'll be waiting somewhere in the chaparral. No one knows the spot wherehe'll he, nor the specific time to go to him. If you're capable of determiningthe right time to leave the house, you will also be capable of guiding yourselfto where he is.\"I told don Juan that I could not imagine anyone being able to solve such ariddle.\"How can leaving the house at a specific time guide me to where don Genaro is?\"I asked.Don Juan smiled and began to hum a tune. He seemed to enjoy my agitation.\"That's the problem which Genaro has set up for you,\" he said. \"If you haveenough personal power, you will decide with absolute certainty the right time toleave the house. How leaving at the precise time will guide you is somethingthat no one knows. And yet, if you have enough power, you yourself will attestthat this is so.\"\"But how am I going to be guided, don Juan?\"\"No one knows that either.\"\"I think don Genaro is pulling my leg.\"\"You better watch out then,\" he said. \"If Genaro is pulling your leg he's liableto yank it out.\"Don Juan laughed at his own joke. I could not join him. My fear about theinherent danger of don Genaro's manipulations was too real.\"Can you give me some clues?\" I asked.\"There are no clues!\" he said cuttingly.\"Why does don Genaro want to do this?\"\"He wants to test you,\" he replied. \"Let's say that it is very important for himto know whether you can take the sorcerers' explanation. If you solve theriddle, the implication will be that you have stored enough personal power andyou're ready. But if you flub it, it'll be because you don't have enough powerand in that case the sorcerers' explanation won't make any sense to you.\"I think that we should give you the explanation regardless of whether youunderstand it or not. That's my idea. Genaro is a more conservative warrior. Hewants things in their proper order and he won't give in until he thinks you'reready.\"\"Why don't you just tell me about the sorcerers' explanation yourself?\"\"Because Genaro must be the one who helps you.\"\"Why is that so, don Juan?\"\"Genaro doesn't want me to tell you why,\" he said. \"Not yet.\"\"Would it hurt me to know the sorcerers' explanation?\" I asked.\"I don't think so.\"\"Please, don Juan, tell me then.\"\"You must be joking. Genaro has precise ideas on this matter, and we must honorand respect them.\"He made an imperative gesture to quiet me.After a long unnerving pause I ventured a question. \"But how can I solve thisriddle, don Juan?\"\"I really don't know that. Thus I can't advise you what to do,\" he said. \"Genarois most efficient. He designed the riddle just for you. Since he's doing thisfor your benefit, he's attuned to you alone. Therefore only you can pick theprecise time to leave the house. He will call you himself, and guide you bymeans of his call.\"\"What will his call be like?\"\"I don't know. His call is for you; not for me. He'll be tapping your willdirectly. In other words, you must use your will in order to know the call.\"Genaro feels that he must make sure at this point that you have storedsufficient personal power to enable you to turn your will into a functioningunit.\"'Will' was another concept which don Juan had delineated [* delineate- describein vivid detail] with great care, but without making it clear. I had gatheredfrom his explanations that 'will' was a force that emanated from the umbilicalregion through an unseen opening below the navel; an opening he had called the'gap'. 'Will' was allegedly cultivated only by sorcerers. It came to thepractitioners veiled in mystery, and purportedly [* purportedly- believed, orreputed to be the case] gave them the capacity to perform extraordinary acts.I remarked to don Juan that there was no chance that anything so vague couldever be a functioning unit in my life.\"That's where you're wrong,\" he said. \"The will develops in a warrior in spiteof every opposition of the reason.\"\"Can't don Genaro, being a sorcerer, know whether I'm ready or not withouttesting me?\" I asked.\"He certainly can,\" he said. \"But that knowledge won't be of any value orconsequence because it has nothing to do with you. You are the one who'slearning. Therefore you yourself must claim knowledge as power; not Genaro.Genaro is not concerned with his knowing as much as with your knowing.You must find out whether or not your will works. This is a very difficult pointto make. In spite of what Genaro or I know about you, you must prove to yourselfthat you are in the position to claim knowledge as power.In other words, you yourself have to be convinced that you can exercise your'will'. If you're not, then you must become convinced today. If you cannotperform this task, then Genaro's conclusion will be that regardless of what hemight see about you, you're not ready yet.\"I experienced an overwhelming apprehension.\"Is all this necessary?\" I asked.\"It's Genaro's request and must be obeyed,\" he said in a firm but friendly tone.\"But what does don Genaro have to do with me?\"\"You may find that out today,\" he said and smiled.I pleaded with don Juan to get me out of that intolerable situation and explainall the mysterious talk. He laughed and patted my chest, and made a joke about aMexican weight lifter who had enormous pectoral [* pectoral- either of two largemuscles of the chest] muscles but could not do heavy physical labor because hisback was weak.\"Watch those muscles,\" he said. \"They shouldn't be just for show.\"\"My muscles have nothing to do with what you're talking about,\" I said in abelligerent mood.\"They do,\" he replied. \"The body must be perfection before the will is afunctioning unit.\"Don Juan had again deviated the direction of my probing. I felt restless andfrustrated.I stood up and went to the kitchen and drank some water. Don Juan followed me,and suggested that I should practice the animal cry that don Genaro had taughtme. We walked to the side of the house. I sat on a pile of wood and involvedmyself in reproducing it. Don Juan made some corrections and gave me somepointers about my breathing. The end result was a state of complete physicalrelaxation.We returned to the ramada and sat down again. I told him that sometimes I feltirked with myself because I was so helpless.\"There is nothing wrong with the feeling of being helpless,\" he said. \"All of usare most familiar with it. Remember that we have spent an eternity as helplessinfants. I have already told you that at this very moment you are like an infantwho can't get out of the crib by himself; much less act on his own. Genaro getsyou out of your crib, let's say, by picking you up. But an infant wants to act,and since he can't he complains. There is nothing wrong with that, but toindulge in protesting and complaining is another matter.\"He demanded that I keep myself relaxed. He suggested that I ask him questionsfor a while until I was in a better frame of mind.For a moment I was at a loss and could not decide what to ask.Don Juan unrolled a straw mat and told me to sit on it. Then he filled a largegourd with water and put it in a carrying net. He seemed to be preparing for ajourney. He sat down again and urged me with a movement of his eyebrows to beginmy questions.I asked him to tell me more about the moth.He gave me a long scrutinizing look and chuckled.\"That was an ally,\" he said. \"You know that.\"\"But what actually is an ally, don Juan?\"\"There is no way of saying what exactly an ally is; just as there is no way ofsaying what exactly a tree is.\"\"A tree is a living organism,\" I said.\"That doesn't tell me much,\" he said. \"I can also say that an ally is a force; atension. I've told you that already, but that doesn't say much about an ally.\"Just like in the case of a tree, the only way to know 'what an ally is' is byexperiencing it. Over the years I have struggled to prepare you for themomentous encounter with an ally. You may not realize this, but it took youyears of preparation to meet tree. To meet ally is no different. A teacher mustacquaint his disciple with ally little by little; piece by piece. You have overthe course of the years stored a great amount of knowledge about it, and now youare capable of putting that knowledge together to experience ally the way youexperience tree.\"\"I have no idea that I'm doing that, don Juan.\"\"Your reason is not aware of it because it cannot accept the possibility of allyto begin with. Fortunately it is not the reason which puts ally together. It isthe body. You have perceived ally in many degrees and on many occasions. Each ofthose perceptions was stored in your body. The sum of those pieces is the ally.I don't know any other way of describing it.\"I said that I could not conceive that my body was acting by itself as if it werean entity separate from my reason.\"It isn't, but we have made it so,\" he said. \"Our reason is petty and it isalways at odds with our body. This of course is only a way of talking, but thetriumph of a man of knowledge is that he has joined the two together. Sinceyou're not a man of knowledge, your body does things now that your reason cannotcomprehend. The ally is one of those things. You were not mad, and neither wereyou dreaming when you perceived the ally that night- right here.\"I asked him about the frightening idea which he and don Genaro had implanted inme; that the ally was an entity waiting for me at the edge of a small valley inthe mountains of northern Mexico. They had told me that sooner or later I had tokeep my appointment with the ally and wrestle with it.\"Those are ways of talking about mysteries for which there are no words,\" hesaid. \"Genaro and I said that at the edge of that plain the ally was waiting foryou. That statement was true, but it doesn't have the meaning that you want togive it.\"The ally is waiting for you. That's for sure, but it is not at the edge of anyplain. It is right here, or there, or in any other place. The ally is waitingfor you just like death is waiting for you; everywhere and nowhere.\"\"Why is the ally waiting for me?\"\"For the same reason that death waits for you,\" he said, \"because you were born.There is no possibility of explaining at this point what is meant by that. Youmust first experience the ally. You must perceive it in its full force. Then thesorcerers' explanation may throw light upon it. So far you've had enough powerto clarify at least one point; that the ally is a moth.\"Some years ago you and I went to the mountains, and you had a bout withsomething. I had no way of telling you then what was taking place. You saw astrange shadow flying back and forth in front of the fire. You yourself saidthat it looked like a moth. Although you didn't know what you were talkingabout, you were absolutely correct. The shadow was a moth.Then on another occasion something frightened you out of your wits after you hadfallen asleep; again, in front of a fire. I had warned you not to fall asleep,but you disregarded my warning. That act left you at the mercy of the ally andthe moth stepped on your neck. Why you survived will always be a mystery to me.You didn't know then, but I had given you up for dead. Your blunder was thatserious.\"From then on, every time we've been in the mountains or in the desert, even ifyou didn't notice it, the moth always followed us. All in all then, we can saythat for you the ally is a moth. But I cannot say that it is really a moth theway we know moths. Calling the ally a moth is again only a way of talking; a wayof making that immensity out there understandable.\"\"Is the ally a moth for you too?\" I asked.\"No. The way one understands the ally is a personal matter,\" he said.I mentioned that we were back where we had started. He had not told me what anally really was.\"There's no need to be confused,\" he said. \"Confusion is a mood one enters into,but one can also get out of it. At this point there is no way of clarifyinganything. Perhaps later on today we'll be able to consider these matters indetail. It's up to you, or rather, it's up to your personal power.\"He refused to say one more word. I became quite upset with the fear that I wasgoing to fail the test. Don Juan took me to the back of his house and made mesit on a straw mat at the edge of an irrigation ditch. The water moved so slowlythat it almost seemed stagnant. He commanded me to sit quietly, shut off myinternal dialogue, and look at the water.He said that years before he had discovered that I had a certain affinity forbodies of water; a feeling that was most convenient for the endeavors I wasinvolved in. I remarked that I was not particularly fond of bodies of water, butneither did I dislike them. He said that that was precisely why water wasbeneficial for me. I was indifferent towards it. Under conditions of stresswater could not trap me, and neither could it reject me.He sat slightly behind me to my right, and admonished me to let go and not beafraid because he was there to help me if there was any need.I had a moment of fear. I looked at him, waiting for further instructions. Heforcibly turned my head towards the water and ordered me to proceed. I had noidea what he wanted me to do, so I simply relaxed.As I looked at the water, I caught sight of the reeds on the opposite side.Unconsciously I rested my unfocused eyes on them. The slow current made themquiver. The water had the color of the desert dirt. I noticed that the ripplesaround the reeds looked like furrows or crevices on a smooth surface. At oneinstant the reeds became gigantic. The water was a smooth flat ocher surface.Then in a matter of seconds I was sound asleep; or perhaps I entered into aperceptual state for which I had no parallel. The closest way of describing itwould be to say that I went to sleep and had a portentous [* portentous- ofmomentous or ominous significance] dream.I felt that I could have gone on with it indefinitely if I had wanted to, but Ideliberately ended it by engaging myself in a conscious self-dialogue. I openedmy eyes. I was lying on the straw mat. Don Juan was a few feet away. My dreamhad been so magnificent that I began to recount it to him. He signaled me to bequiet.With a long twig he pointed to two long shadows that some dry branches of desertchaparral cast on the ground. The tip of his twig followed the outline of one ofthe shadows as if it were drawing it. Then it jumped to the other and did thesame with it. The shadows were about a foot long and over an inch wide. Theywere from five to six inches apart from each other.The movement of the twig forced my eyes out of focus and I found myself lookingwith crossed eyes at four long shadows. Suddenly the two shadows in the middlemerged into one and created an extraordinary perception of depth. There was someinexplicable roundness and volume in the shadow thus formed. It was almost likea transparent tube; a round bar of some unknown substance. I knew that my eyeswere crossed and yet they seemed to be focused on one spot. The view there wascrystal clear. I could move my eyes without dispelling the image.I continued watching but without letting my guard down. I experienced a curiouscompulsion to let go and immerse myself in the scene. Something in what I wasobserving seemed to pull me, but something in myself surfaced and I began asemiconscious dialogue. Almost instantly I became aware of my surroundings inthe world of everyday life.Don Juan was watching me. He appeared to be puzzled. I asked him if there wassomething wrong. He did not answer. He helped me to sit up. It was only thenthat I realized that I had been lying on my back looking at the sky, and donJuan had been leaning over my face.My first impulse was to tell him that I had actually seen the shadows on theground while I had been looking at the sky, but he put his hand over my mouth.We sat in silence for a while. I had no thoughts. I experienced an exquisitesense of peace, and then quite abruptly I had an unyielding urge to get up andgo into the chaparral to look for don Genaro.I made an attempt to speak to don Juan. He jutted his chin and twisted his lipsas a silent command not to talk. I tried to assess my predicament in a rationalmanner. I was enjoying my silence so much, however, that I did not want tobother with logical considerations.After a moment's pause, I again felt the imperious need to walk into the bushes.I followed a trail. Don Juan tagged along behind me as if I were the leader.We walked for about an hour. I succeeded in remaining without any thoughts. Thenwe came to a hillside. Don Genaro was there sitting near the top of a rock wall.He greeted me effusively and had to yell his words. He was about fifty feetabove the ground. Don Juan made me sit down and then sat next to me.Don Genaro explained that I had found the place where he had been waitingbecause he had guided me with a sound he had been making. As he voiced his wordsI realized that I had indeed been hearing a peculiar sound I thought to be abuzzing in my ears. It had seemed to be more of an internal affair; a bodilycondition; a feeling of sound so undetermined that it was beyond the realm ofconscious assessment and interpretation.I believed that don Genaro had a small instrument in his left hand. From where Isat I could not distinguish it clearly. It looked like a jew's-harp. With it heproduced a soft eerie sound which was practically indiscernible. [*indiscernible- barely able to be perceived] He kept on playing it for a moment,as if allowing me time to fully realize what he had just said.Then he showed me his left hand. There was nothing in it. He was not holding anyinstrument. It had appeared to me that he was playing some instrument because ofthe manner in which he had put his hand to his mouth. Actually the sound wasbeing produced with his lips and the edge of his left hand between the thumb andindex finger.I turned to don Juan to explain to him that I had been fooled by don Genaro'smovements. He made a quick gesture, told me not to talk, and told me to payclose attention to what don Genaro was doing. I turned back to look at donGenaro, but he was no longer there. I thought that he must have climbed down. Iwaited a few moments for him to emerge from behind the bushes.The rock he had been standing on was a peculiar formation. It was more like ahuge ledge on the side of a larger rock wall. I must have taken my eyes awayfrom him for only a couple of seconds. If he had climbed up, I would have caughtsight of him before he had reached the top of the rock wall; and if he hadclimbed down, he would also have been visible from where I was sitting.I asked don Juan about don Genaro's whereabouts. He replied that he still wasstanding on the rock ledge. As far as I could judge there was no one there, butdon Juan maintained over and over again that don Genaro was still standing onthe rock.He did not seem to be joking. His eyes were steady and fierce. He said in acutting tone that my senses were not the proper avenue to appraise what donGenaro was doing. He ordered me to shut off my internal dialogue. I struggledfor a moment and began to close my eyes. Don Juan lurched at me and shook me bythe shoulders. He whispered that I had to keep my view on the rock ledge.I had a sensation of drowsiness and heard don Juan's words as if they werecoming from far away. I automatically looked at the ledge. Don Genaro was thereagain. That did not interest me. I noticed semiconsciously that it was verydifficult for me to breathe, but before I could have a thought about it donGenaro jumped to the ground.That act did not catch my interest either. He came over to me and helped mestand up; holding me by the arm. Don Juan held my other arm. They propped me upbetween the two of them. Then it was only don Genaro who was helping me walk. Hewhispered something in my ear that I could not understand, and suddenly I feltthat he pulled my body in some strange way. He grabbed me, in a manner ofspeaking, by the skin of my stomach and pulled me up to the ledge; or perhapsonto another rock.I knew that for an instant I was on a rock. I could have sworn that it was therock ledge. The image was so fleeting, however, that I could not evaluate it indetail. Then I felt that something in me faltered and I fell backwards. I had afaint feeling of anguish or perhaps physical discomfort.The next thing I knew don Juan was talking to me. I could not understand him. Iconcentrated my attention on his lips. The sensation I had was dreamlike. I wastrying to rip from the inside an enveloping film-like sheet that encased mewhile don Juan tried to rip it from the outside. Finally it actually popped, anddon Juan's words became audible and their meaning crystal clear. He wascommanding me to surface by myself. I struggled desperately to gain my sobriety.I had no success. I quite consciously wondered why I was having so much trouble.I fought to talk to myself.Don Juan seemed to be aware of my difficulty. He urged me to try harder.Something out there was preventing me from engaging myself in my familiarinternal dialogue. It was as if a strange force were making me drowsy andindifferent.I fought against it until I began to lose my breath. I heard don Juan talking tome. My body contorted involuntarily with the tension. I felt as if I wereembraced and locked in mortal combat with something that was keeping me frombreathing. I did not have fear, but rather some uncontrollable fury possessedme. My wrath mounted to such heights that I growled and screamed like an animal.Then my body was taken by a seizure. I had a jolt that stopped me instantly. Icould again breathe normally, and then I realized that don Juan had poured hisgourd of water over my stomach and neck; soaking me.He helped me sit up. Don Genaro was standing on the ledge. He called my name andthen jumped to the ground. I saw him plummeting down from a height of fifty feetor so, and I experienced an unbearable sensation around my umbilical region. Ihad had the same sensation in dreams of falling.Don Genaro came to me and asked me, smiling, if I had liked his leap. I triedunsuccessfully to say something. Don Genaro called my name again.\"Carlitos! Watch me!\" he said.He swung his arms at his sides four or five times as if to get momentum, andthen jumped out of sight; or I thought he did; or perhaps he did something elsefor which I had no description. He had been five or six feet away from me, andthen he vanished as if he had been sucked away by an uncontrollable force.I felt aloof and tired. I had a sense of indifference and did not want to thinkor talk to myself. I was not afraid; but inexplicably sad. I wanted to weep. DonJuan hit me repeatedly with his knuckles on the top of my head and laughed as ifeverything that had happened were a joke. He then demanded that I talk to myselfbecause that was the time when the internal dialogue was desperately needed. Iheard him ordering me, \"Talk! Talk.\"I had an involuntary spasm in the muscles of my lips. My mouth moved withoutsounds. I remembered don Genaro moving his mouth in a similar way when he wasclowning and I wished I could have said, as he had, \"My mouth doesn't want totalk.\" I tried to voice the words and my lips contorted in a painful way. DonJuan seemed to be on the verge of collapsing with laughter. His enjoyment wascontagious and I also laughed. Finally he helped me to stand up. I asked him ifdon Genaro was coming back. He said that don Genaro had had enough of me for theday. Later, don Juan and I were sitting near the fire in his earth stove. He hadinsisted that I eat. I was not hungry, or tired. An unusual melancholy hadovertaken me. I felt removed from all the events of the day.\"You almost made it,\" don Juan said.Don Juan handed me my writing pad. I made a supreme effort to recapture my usualstate. I jotted down some comments. Little by little I brought myself back intomy old pattern. It was as if a veil were being lifted. Suddenly I was againinvolved in my familiar attitude of interest and bewilderment.\"Good, good,\" don Juan said, patting my head. \"I've told you that the true artof a warrior is to balance terror and wonder.\"Don Juan's mood was unusual. He seemed almost nervous; anxious. He appeared tobe willing to speak on his own accord. I believed that he was preparing me forthe sorcerers' explanation, and I became quite anxious myself. His eyes had astrange glimmer that I had seen only a few times before.After I told him what I thought of his unusual attitude, he said that he washappy for me; that as a warrior he could rejoice in the triumphs of his fellowmen if they were triumphs of the spirit. He added that, unfortunately, I was notyet ready for the sorcerers' explanation in spite of the fact that I hadsuccessfully solved don Genaro's riddle. His contention was that when he hadpoured water over my body, I had actually been dying; and my whole achievementhad been canceled out by my incapacity to fend off the last of don Genaro'sonslaughts.\"Genaro's power was like a tide that engulfed you,\" he said.\"Did don Genaro want to hurt me?\" I asked.\"No,\" he said. \"Genaro wants to help you. But power can be met only with power.He was testing you and you failed.\"\"But I solved his riddle, didn't I?\"\"You did fine,\" he said. \"So fine that Genaro had to believe that you werecapable of a complete warrior's feat. You almost made it. What floored you thistime was not indulging, though.\"\"What was it then?\"\"You're too impatient and violent. Instead of relaxing and going with Genaro,you began to fight him. You can't win against him. He's stronger than you.\"Don Juan then volunteered some advice and suggestions about my personalrelations with people. His remarks were a serious sequel to what don Genaro hadjokingly said to me earlier. He was in a talkative mood, and without any coaxingon my part, he began to explain what had taken place during the last two times Ihad been there.\"As you know,\" he said, \"the crux of sorcery is the internal dialogue. That isthe key to everything. When a warrior learns to stop it, everything becomespossible. The most farfetched schemes become attainable. The passageway to allthe weird and eerie experiences that you have had recently was the fact that youcould stop talking to yourself.\"You have in complete sobriety witnessed the ally, Genaro's double, and 'thedreamer and the dreamed'; and today you almost learned about the totality ofyourself. That was the warrior's feat that Genaro expected you to perform.\"All this has been possible because of the amount of personal power that youhave stored. It started the last time you were here when I caught sight of avery auspicious [*auspicious -favourable circumstances predictable from an omen]omen. As you arrived, I heard the ally prowling around. First I heard its softsteps, and then I saw the moth looking at you as you got out of your car. Theally was motionless watching you.\"That to me was the best omen. Had the ally been agitated and moving around asif it was displeased with your presence- the way it always had been- the courseof the events would have been different. Many times I have caught sight of theally in an unfriendly state towards you.\"But this time the omen was right, and I knew that the ally had a piece ofknowledge for you. That was the reason why I said that you had an appointmentwith knowledge; an appointment with a moth that had been pending for a longtime. For reasons inconceivable to us, the ally selected the form of a moth tomanifest itself to you.\"\"But you said that the ally was formless and that one could only judge itseffects,\" I said.\"That is right,\" he said. \"But the ally is a moth for the onlookers who areassociated with you; Genaro and myself. For you the ally is only an effect: asensation in your body, or a sound, or the golden specks of knowledge. Itremains as a fact, nonetheless, that by choosing the form of a moth the ally istelling Genaro and me something of great importance. Moths are the givers ofknowledge, and the friends and helpers of sorcerers. It is because the allychose to be a moth around you that Genaro places such a great emphasis on you.\"That night that you met the moth, as I had anticipated, was a true appointmentwith knowledge for you. You learned the moth's call, felt the gold dust of itswings, but above all, that night for the first time you were aware that you saw.\"And your body learned that we are luminous beings. You have not yet assessedcorrectly that monumental event in your life. Genaro demonstrated for you withtremendous force and clarity that we are a feeling, and that what we call ourbody is a cluster of luminous fibers that have awareness.\"Last night you were back again under the good auspices [* auspices- kindlyendorsement and guidance] of the ally. I came to look at you as you arrived, andI knew that I had to call Genaro so he could explain to you the mystery of thedreamer and the dreamed. You believed then, just as you always have, that I wastricking you.\"But Genaro was not hiding in the bushes as you thought. He came over for youeven if your reason refuses to believe it.\"That part of don Juan's elucidation was indeed the hardest to take at its facevalue. I could not admit it. I said that don Genaro had been real and of thisworld.\"Everything that you've witnessed so far has been real and of this world,\" hesaid. \"There is no other world. Your stumbling block is a peculiar insistence onyour part, and that peculiarity of yours is not going to be cured byexplanations.\"So today Genaro addressed himself directly to your body. A careful examinationof what you did today will reveal to you that your body put things together in amost praiseworthy manner. Somehow you refrained from indulging in your visionsat the irrigation ditch. You kept a rare control and aloofness as warriorsshould. You didn't believe anything, but you still acted efficiently and thusyou were capable of following Genaro's call. You actually found him without anyaid from me.\"When we arrived at the rock ledge, you were imbued with power and you sawGenaro standing where other sorcerers have stood for similar reasons. He walkedover to you after jumping from the ledge. He himself was all power. Had youproceeded as you did earlier by the irrigation ditch, you would've seen him ashe really is; a luminous being.\"Instead, you got frightened, especially when Genaro made you leap. That leap initself should have been sufficient to transport you beyond your boundaries; butyou didn't have the strength, and you fell back into the world of your reason.Then of course, you entered into mortal combat with yourself. Something in you-your will- wanted to go with Genaro, while your reason opposed him. Had I nothelped you, you now would be lying dead and buried in that power place. But evenwith my help the outcome was dubious [* dubious- filled with with uncertainty ordoubt] for a moment.\"We were silent for a few minutes. I waited for him to speak. Finally I asked,\"Did don Genaro make me leap up to the rock ledge?\"\"Don't take that leap in the sense that you understand a leap,\" he said. \"Onceagain this is only a way of speaking. As long as you think that you are a solidbody, you cannot conceive what I am talking about.\"He then spilled some ashes on the ground by the lantern covering an area abouttwo feet square, and drew a diagram with his fingers; a diagram that had eightpoints interconnected with lines. It was a geometrical figure.img2.png [images/img2.png]He had drawn a similar one years before when he tried to explain to me that itwas not an illusion that I had observed the same leaf falling four times fromthe same tree.The diagram in the ashes had two epicenters. One he called 'reason', and theother 'will'.'Reason' was interconnected directly with a point he called 'talking'. Through'talking', 'reason' was indirectly connected to three other points: 'feeling','dreaming' and 'seeing'. The other epicenter, 'will', was directly connected to'feeling', 'dreaming' and 'seeing'; but only indirectly connected to 'reason'and 'talking'.I remarked that the diagram was different from the one I had recorded yearsbefore.\"The outer form is of no importance,\" he said. \"These points represent a humanbeing, and can be drawn in any way you want.\"\"Do they represent the body of a human being?\" I asked.\"Don't call it the body,\" he said. \"These are eight points on the fibers of aluminous being.\"A sorcerer says, as you can see in the diagram, that a human being is first ofall 'will'; because 'will' is directly connected to three points: 'feeling','dreaming' and 'seeing'.\"Then next, a human being is 'reason'. This is properly a center that is smallerthan 'will'. It is connected only with 'talking'.\"\"What are the other two points, don Juan?\"He looked at me and smiled.\"You're a lot stronger now than you were the first time we talked about thisdiagram,\" he said. \"But you're not yet strong enough to know all the eightpoints. Genaro will someday show you the other two.\"\"Does everybody have those eight points or only sorcerers?\"\"We may say that every one of us brings to the world eight points. Two of them-'reason' and 'talking'- are known by everyone. 'Feeling' is always vague butsomehow familiar. But only in the world of sorcerers does one get fullyacquainted with 'dreaming', 'seeing', and 'will'.\"And finally, at the outer edge of that world one encounters the other two. Theeight points make the totality of oneself.\"He showed me in the diagram that in essence all the points could be made toconnect with one another indirectly.I asked him again about the two mysterious remaining points. He showed me thatthey were connected only to 'will' and that they were removed from 'feeling','dreaming' and 'seeing'; and much more distant from 'talking' and 'reason'. Hepointed with his finger to show that they were isolated from the rest and fromeach other.\"Those two points will never yield to 'talking' or to 'reason',\" he said. \"Only'will' can handle them. 'Reason' is so removed from them that it is utterlyuseless to try figuring them out. This is one of the hardest things to realize.After all, the forte of 'reason' is to reason out everything.\"I asked him if the eight points corresponded to areas or to certain organs in ahuman being.\"They do,\" he replied dryly and erased the diagram.He touched my head and said that that was the center of 'reason' and 'talking'.The tip of my sternum [* sternum- the flat bone that articulates with theclavicles and the first seven pairs of ribs] was the center of 'feeling'. Thearea below the navel was 'will'. 'Dreaming' was on the right side against theribs. 'Seeing' on the left. He said that sometimes in some warriors 'seeing' and'dreaming' were on the right side.\"Where are the other two points?\" I asked.He gave me a most obscene answer and broke into a belly laugh.\"You're so sneaky,\" he said. \"You think I'm a sleepy old goat, don't you?\"I explained to him that my questions created their own momentum.\"Don't try to hurry,\" he said. \"You'll know in due time, and then you will be onyour own by yourself.\"\"Do you mean that I won't see you any more, don Juan?\"\"Not ever again,\" he said. \"Genaro and I will be then what we always have been;dust on the road.\"I had a jolt in the pit of my stomach.\"What are you saying, don Juan?\"\"I'm saying that we all are unfathomable beings; luminous and boundless. You,Genaro, and I are stuck together by a purpose that is not our decision.\"\"What purpose are you talking about?\"\"Learning the warrior's way. You can't get out of it, but neither can we. Aslong as our achievement is pending you will find me or Genaro. But once it isaccomplished you will fly freely, and no one knows where the force of your lifewill take you.\"\"What is don Genaro doing in this?\"\"That subject is not in your realm yet,\" he said. \"Today I have to pound thenail that Genaro put in; the fact that we are luminous beings. We areperceivers. We are an awareness. We are not objects. We have no solidity. We areboundless.\"The world of objects and solidity is a way of making our passage on earthconvenient. It is only a description that was created to help us. Each of us, orrather our reason, forgets that the description is only a description, and thuswe entrap the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle from which we rarelyemerge in our lifetime.\"At this moment for instance, you are involved in extricating yourself from thesnarls of reason. It is preposterous and unthinkable for you that Genaro justappeared at the edge of the chaparral, and yet you cannot deny that youwitnessed it. You perceived it as such.\"Don Juan chuckled. He carefully drew another diagram in the ashes and covered itwith his hat before I could copy it.\"We are perceivers,\" he proceeded. \"The world that we perceive, though, is anillusion. It was created by a description that was told to us since the momentwe were born.\"We the luminous beings are born with two rings of power, but we use only one tocreate the world. That ring which is hooked very soon after we are born is'reason', and its companion is 'talking'. Between the two they concoct andmaintain the world.\"So, in essence, the world that your 'reason' wants to sustain is the worldcreated by a description, and its dogmatic and inviolable rules; a descriptionwhich 'reason' learns to accept and defend.\"The secret of the luminous beings is that they have another ring of power whichis never used; the 'will'. The trick of the sorcerer is the same trick of theaverage man. Both have a description.\"One- the average man- upholds it with his 'reason'. The other- the sorcerer-upholds it with his 'will'. Both descriptions have their rules, and the rulesare perceivable. But the advantage of the sorcerer is that 'will' is moreengulfing than 'reason'.\"The suggestion that I want to make at this point is that from now on you shouldlet yourself perceive whether the description is upheld by your 'reason' or byyour 'will'. I feel that is the only way for you to use your daily world as achallenge and a vehicle to accumulate enough personal power in order to get tothe totality of yourself.\"Perhaps the next time that you come you'll have enough of it. At any rate, waituntil you feel like you felt today at the irrigation ditch; that an inner voiceis telling you to do so. If you come in any other spirit it'll be a waste oftime and a danger to you.\"I remarked that if I had to wait for that inner voice I would never see themagain.\"You'd be surprised how well one can perform if one is against the wall,\" hesaid.He stood up and picked up a bundle of firewood. He placed some dry sticks on theearth stove. The flames cast a yellowish glow on the ground. He then turned offthe lantern, and squatted in front of his hat which was covering the drawing hehad made in the ashes.He commanded me to sit calmly, shut off my internal dialogue, and keep my eyeson his hat. I struggled for a few moments and then I felt a sensation offloating; of falling off a cliff. It was as if nothing were supporting me; as ifI were not sitting or did not have a body.Don Juan lifted his hat. Underneath there were spirals of ashes. I watched themwithout thinking. I felt the spirals moving. I felt them in my stomach. Theashes seemed to pile up. Then they were stirred and fluffed, and suddenly donGenaro was sitting in front of me.The sight forced me instantly into my internal dialogue. I thought that I musthave fallen asleep. I began to breathe in short gasps and tried to open my eyes,but my eyes were open.I heard don Juan telling me to get up and move around. I jumped up and ran tothe ramada. Don Juan and don Genaro ran after me. Don Juan brought his lantern.I could not catch my breath. I tried to calm myself as I had done before byjogging in place while I faced the west. I lifted my arms and began breathing.Don Juan came to my side and said that those movements were done only in thetwilight.Don Genaro yelled that it was twilight for me and both of them began to laugh.Don Genaro ran to the edge of the bushes, and then bounced back to the ramada asif he had been attached to a giant rubber band that made him snap back. Herepeated the same movement three or four times, and then came to my side. DonJuan had been looking at me fixedly; giggling like a child.They exchanged a furtive glance. Don Juan said to don Genaro in a loud voicethat my reason was dangerous, and that it could kill me if it was not placated.\"For heaven's sake!\" don Genaro exclaimed in a roaring voice. \"Placate hisreason!\"They jumped up and down, and laughed like two children.Don Juan made me sit down underneath the lantern, and handed me my notebook.\"Tonight we're really pulling your leg,\" he said in a conciliatory tone. \"Don'tbe afraid. Genaro was hiding under my hat.\" ================================================================= Part Two: The Tonal and the Nagual"},{"pageContent":"Having to Believe I walked towards downtown on the Paseo de la Reforma. I was tired. The altitudeof Mexico City no doubt had something to do with it. I could have taken a bus ora taxi but somehow in spite of my fatigue I wanted to walk. It was Sundayafternoon. The traffic was minimal and yet the exhaust fumes of the buses andtrucks with diesel engines made the narrow streets of downtown seem like canyonsof smog.I arrived at the Zocalo and noticed that the cathedral of Mexico City seemed tobe more slanted than the last time I had seen it. I stepped a few feet insidethe enormous halls. A cynical thought crossed my mind.From there I headed for the Lagunilla market. I had no definite purpose in mind.I walked aimlessly but at a good pace without looking at anything in particular.I ended up at the stands of old coins and secondhand books.\"Hello, hello! Look who's here!\" someone said, tapping me lighdy on theshoulder.The voice and the touch made me jump. I quickly turned to my right. My mouthopened in surprise. The person who had spoken to me was don Juan.\"My God, don Juan!\" I exclaimed and a shiver shook my body from head to toe.\"What are you doing here?\"\"What are you doing here?\" he retorted as an echo.I told him that I had stopped in the city for a couple of days before venturinginto the mountains of central Mexico to search for him.\"Well let's say then that I came down from the mountains to find you,\" he said,smiling.He patted me on the shoulder several times. He seemed to be glad to see me. Heput his hands on his hips and swelled his chest, and asked me whether or not Iliked his appearance. It was only then that I noticed he was wearing a suit. Thefull impact of such an incongruity hit me. I was dumfounded.\"How do you like my tacuche?\" he asked, beaming. He used the slang word'tacuche' instead of the standard Spanish word 'traje' for suit.\"Today I'm in a suit,\" he said as if he had to explain, and then pointing to myopen mouth he added, \"Close it! Close it!\"I laughed absent-mindedly. He noticed my confusion. His body shook with laughteras he turned around so I could see him from every angle. His attire wasincredible. He was wearing a light brown suit with pin stripes, brown shoes, awhite shirt, and a necktie! And that made me wonder if he had any socks on,or... Was he wearing his shoes without them?What added to my bewilderment was the maddening sensation I had had that whendon Juan tapped me on the shoulder and I turned around, I thought I had seen himin his khaki pants and shirt, his sandals, and his straw hat.And then as he made me aware of his attire, and as I focused my attention onevery detail of it, the complete unit of his dress became fixed as if I hadcreated it with my thoughts. My mouth seemed to be the area of my body which wasmost taxed by the surprise. It opened involuntarily. Don Juan touched me gentlyon my chin as if he were helping me to close it.\"You certainly are developing a double chin,\" he said and laughed in shortspurts.I became aware then that he did not have a hat on, and that his short white hairwas parted on the right side. He looked like an old Mexican gentleman; animpeccably tailored urban dweller.I told him that to have found him there was so unnerving to me that I had to sitdown. He was very understanding and suggested that we go to a nearby park.We walked a few blocks in complete silence and then we arrived at the PlazaGaribaldi; a place where musicians offered their services; a sort of musicians'employment center.Don Juan and I merged with scores of spectators and tourists, and walked aroundthe park. After a while he stopped, leaned against a wall, and pulled his pantsup slightly at the knees. He was wearing light brown socks. I asked him to tellme the meaning of his mysterious apparel. His vague reply was that he simply hadto be in a suit that day for reasons that would be clear to me later.Finding Don Juan in a suit had been so unearthly that my agitation was almostuncontrollable. I had not seen him for several months and I wanted more thananything else in the world to talk with him; but somehow the setting was wrongand my attention meandered around. Don Juan must have noticed my anxiety andsuggested that we walk to La Alameda, a more quiet park a few blocks away.There were not too many people in the park and we had no trouble finding anempty bench. We sat down. My nervousness had given way to a feeling ofuneasiness. I did not dare to look at don Juan.There was a long unnerving pause. Still without looking at him, I said that theinner voice had finally driven me to search for him; that the staggering eventsI had witnessed at his house had affected my life very deeply, and that I justhad to talk about them.He made a gesture of impatience with his hand and said that his policy was neverto dwell on past events.\"What's important now is that you've fulfilled my suggestion,\" he said. \"Youhave taken your daily world as a challenge, and the proof that you have storedsufficient personal power is the indisputable fact that you have found me withno difficulty whatever at the precise spot where you were supposed to.\"\"I doubt very much that I could take credit for that,\" I said.\"I was waiting for you and then you showed up,\" he said. \"That's all I know.That's all any warrior would care to know.\"\"What's going to happen now that I've found you?\" I asked.\"For one thing,\" he said, \"we won't discuss the dilemmas of your reason. Thoseexperiences belong to another time and to another mood. They are, properlyspeaking, only steps of an endless ladder. To emphasize them would take awayfrom the importance of what's taking place now. A warrior cannot possibly affordto do that.\"I had an almost invincible desire to complain. It was not that I resentedanything that had happened to me but I craved solace and sympathy. Don Juanappeared to know my mood and spoke as if I had actually voiced my thoughts.\"Only as a warrior can one withstand the path of knowledge,\" he said. \"A warriorcannot complain or regret anything. His life is an endless challenge, andchallenges cannot possibly be good or bad. Challenges are simply challenges.\"His tone was dry and severe, but his smile was warm and disarming.\"Now that you are here, what we'll do is wait for an omen,\" he said.\"What kind of omen?\" I asked.\"We need to find out whether your power can stand on its own,\" he said. \"Thelast time it petered out miserably. This time the circumstances of your personallife appear to have given you, at least on the surface, all the necessaries [*necessaries- things indispensable] to deal with the sorcerers' explanation.\"\"Is there a chance that you might tell me about it?\" I asked.\"It depends on your personal power,\" he said. \"As is always the case in thedoings and not-doings of warriors, personal power is the only thing thatmatters. So far, I should say that you're doing fine.\"After a moment's silence, as if wanting to change the subject, he stood up andpointed to his suit.\"I have put on my suit for you,\" he said in a mysterious tone. \"This suit is mychallenge. Look how good I look in it! How easy! Eh? Nothing to it!\"Don Juan did look extraordinarily well in a suit. All I could think of as agauge for comparison was the way my grandfather used to look in his heavyEnglish flannel suit. He always gave me the impression that he felt unnatural;out of place in a suit. Don Juan, on the contrary, was so at ease.\"Do you think it is easy for me to look natural in a suit?\" don Juan asked.I did not know what to say. I concluded to myself, however, that judging by hisappearance and by the way he conducted himself: it was the easiest thing in theworld for him.\"To wear a suit is a challenge for me,\" he said. \"A challenge as difficult aswearing sandals and a poncho would be for you. You have never had the necessityto take that as a challenge, though. My case is different. I'm an Indian.\"We looked at each other. He raised his brows in a silent question as if askingfor my comments.\"The basic difference between an ordinary man and a warrior is that a warriortakes everything as a challenge,\" he went on, \"while an ordinary man takeseverything either as a blessing or as a curse. The fact that you're here todayindicates that you have tipped the scales in favor of the warrior's way.\"His stare made me feel nervous. I tried to get up and walk, but he made me sitdown.\"You are going to sit here without fretting until we're through,\" he saidimperatively. \"We are waiting for an omen. We can't proceed without it becauseit isn't enough that you found me; as it wasn't enough that you found Genarothat day in the desert. Your power must round itself up and give an indication.\"\"I can't figure out what you want,\" I said.\"I saw something prowling around this park,\" he said.\"Was it the ally?\" I asked.\"No. It wasn't. So, we must sit here and find out what kind of omen your poweris rounding up.\"He then asked me to give him a detailed account of how I had carried out therecommendations made by don Genaro and himself about my daily world, and myrelations with people.I felt a bit embarrassed. He put me at ease with the argument that my personalaffairs were not private because they included a task of sorcery that he and donGenaro were fostering in me. I jokingly remarked that my life had been ruinedbecause of that task of sorcery; and recounted the difficulties in maintainingmy day-to-day world.I talked for a long time. Don Juan laughed at my account until tears wererolling down his cheeks. He slapped his thighs repeatedly. That gesture, which Ihad seen him do hundreds of times, was definitely out of place when it was doneon the pants of a suit. I was filled with apprehension which I was compelled tovoice.\"Your suit scares me more than anything you've done to me,\" I said.\"You'll get used to it,\" he said. \"A warrior must be fluid, and must shiftharmoniously with the world around him; whether it is the world of 'reason', orthe world of 'will'.\"The most dangerous aspect of that shifting comes forth every time the warriorfinds that the world is neither one nor the other. I was told that the only wayto succeed in that crucial shifting was by proceeding in one's actions as if onebelieved.\"In other words, the secret of a warrior is that he believes without believing.But obviously a warrior cannot just say he believes and let it go at that. Thatwould be too easy. To just believe would exonerate him from examining hissituation. A warrior, whenever he has to involve himself with believing, does itas a choice as an expression of his innermost predilection. A warrior doesn'tbelieve. A warrior has to believe.\"He stared at me for a few seconds as I wrote in my notebook. I remained silent.I could not say that I understood the difference, but I did not want to argue orask questions. I wanted to think about what he had said, but my mind meanderedas I looked around. On the street behind us there was a long line of automobilesand buses, blowing their horns. At the edge of the park perhaps twenty yardsaway directly in line with the bench where we were sitting, a group of aboutseven people, including three policemen in light gray uniforms, stood over a manlying motionless on the grass. He seemed to be drunk or perhaps seriously ill.I glanced at don Juan. He had also been looking at the man.I told him that for some reason I was incapable of clarifying by myself what hehad just said to me.\"I don't want to ask questions any more,\" I said. \"But if I don't ask you toexplain, I don't understand. Not to ask questions is very abnormal for me.\"\"Please be normal, by all means,\" he said with feigned seriousness.I said that I did not understand the difference between believing and having tobelieve. To me both were the same. To conceive that the statements weredifferent was splitting hairs.\"Remember the story you once told me about your friend and her cats?\" he askedcasually.He looked up at the sky and leaned back against the bench, stretching his legs.He put his hands behind his head and contracted the muscles of his whole body.As it always happens, his bones made a loud cracking sound. He was referring to a story I had once told him about a friend of mine who foundtwo kittens, almost dead, inside a dryer in a laundromat. She revived them, andthrough excellent nourishment and care groomed them into two gigantic cats, ablack one and a reddish one.Two years later she sold her house. Since she could not take the cats with her,and was unable to find another home for them, all she could do under thecircumstances was to take them to an animal hospital and have them put to sleep.I helped her take them. The cats had never been inside a car. She tried to calmthem down. They scratched and bit her, especially the reddish cat, the one shecalled Max. When we finally arrived at the animal hospital, she took the blackcat first. Holding it in her arms and without saying a word, she got out of thecar. The cat played with her Pawing her gently as she pushed open the glass doorto enter the hospital.I glanced at Max. He was sitting in the back. The movement of my head must havescared him, for he dove under the driver's seat. I made the seat slidebackwards. I did not want to reach under it for fear that he would bite orscratch my hand. The cat was lying inside a depression on the floor of the car.He seemed very agitated. His breathing was accelerated. He looked at me. Oureyes met and an overwhelming sensation possessed me. Something took hold of mybody; a form of apprehension, despair, or perhaps embarrassment for being partof what was taking place.I felt a need to explain to Max that it was my friend's decision, and that I wasonly helping her. The cat kept on looking at me as if he understood my words.I looked to see if she was coming. I could see her through the glass door. Shewas talking to the receptionist. My body felt a strange jolt and automatically Iopened the door of my car.\"Run, Max, run!\" I said to the cat.He jumped out of the car, dashed across the street with his body close to theground like a true feline. The opposite side of the street was empty. There wereno cars parked and I could see Max running down the street alone the gutter. Hereached the corner of a big boulevard and then dove through the storm drain intothe sewer.My friend came back. I told her that Max had left. She got into the car and wedrove away without saying a single word.In the months that followed, the incident became a symbol to me. I fancied, orperhaps I saw, a weird flicker in Max's eyes when he looked at me before jumpingout of the car, and I believed that for an instant that castrated, overweight,and useless pet became a cat.I told don Juan that I was convinced that when Max had run across the street andplunged into the sewer his 'cat spirit' was impeccable, and that perhaps at noother time in his life was his 'catness' so evident. The impression that theincident left on me was unforgettable.I told the story to all of my friends. After telling it and retelling it, myidentification with the cat became quite pleasurable.I thought myself to be like Max; overindulgent, domesticated in many ways; andyet I could not help thinking that there was always the possibility of onemoment in which the spirit of man might take over my whole being just like thespirit of 'catness' took over Max's bloated and useless body.Don Juan had liked the story and had made some casual comments about it. He hadsaid that it was not so difficult to let the spirit of man flow and take over;.To sustain it, however, was something that only a warrior could do. \"What about the story of the cats?\" I asked.\"You told me you believed that you're taking your chances, like Max,\" he said.\"I do believe that.\"\"What I've been trying to tell you is that as a warrior you cannot just believethis and let it go at that. With Max, having to believe means that you acceptthe fact that his escape might have been a useless outburst. He might havejumped into the sewer and died instantly. He might have drowned or starved todeath; or he might have been eaten by rats. A warrior considers all thosepossibilities and then chooses to believe in accordance with his innermostpredilection.\"As a warrior you have to believe that Max made it; that he not only escaped butthat he sustained his power. You have to believe it. Let's say that without thatbelief you have nothing.\"The distinction became very clear. I thought I really had chosen to believe thatMax had survived; knowing that he was handicapped by a lifetime of soft andpampered living.\"Believing is a cinch,\" don Juan went on. \"Having to believe is something else.In this case, for instance, power gave you a splendid lesson but you chose touse only part of it. If you have to believe, however, you must use all theevent.\"\"I see what you mean,\" I said.My mind was in a state of clarity and I thought I was grasping his concepts withno effort at all.\"I'm afraid you still don't understand,\" he said, almost whispering.He stared at me. I held his look for a moment.\"What about the other cat?\" he asked.\"Uh? The other cat?\" I repeated involuntarily.I had forgotten about it. My symbol had rotated around Max. The other cat was ofno consequence to me.\"But he is!\" don Juan exclaimed when I voiced my thoughts. \"Having to believemeans that you have to also account for the other cat. The one that wentplayfully licking the hands that were carrying him to his doom. That was the catthat went to his death trustingly; filled with his cat's judgments.\"You think you're like Max, therefore you have forgotten about the other cat.You don't even know his name. Having to believe means that you must considereverything, and before deciding that you are like Max, you must consider thatyou may be like the other cat. Instead of running for your life and taking yourchances, you may be going to your doom happily; filled with your judgments.\"There was an intriguing sadness in his words, or perhaps the sadness was mine.We remained quiet for a long time. Never had it crossed my mind that I might belike the other cat. The thought was very distressing to me.A mild commotion and the muffled sound of voices suddenly forced me out of mymental deliberations. Policemen were dispersing some people gathered around theman lying on the grass. Someone had propped the man's head on a rolled upjacket. The man was lying parallel to the street. He was facing east. From whereI sat I could almost tell that his eyes were open.Don Juan sighed.\"What a magnificent afternoon,\" he said, looking at the sky.\"I don't like Mexico City,\" I said.\"Why not?\"\"I hate the smog.\"He shook his head rhythmically is if he were agreeing with me.\"I would rather be with you in the desert, or in the mountains,\" I said.\"If I were you I would never say that,\" he said.\"I didn't mean anything wrong, don Juan.\"\"We both know that. It is not what you mean that matters, though. A warrior, orany man for that matter, cannot possibly wish he were somewhere else; a warriorbecause he lives by challenge; an ordinary man because he doesn't know where hisdeath is going to find him.\"Look at that man over there lying on the grass. What do you think is wrong withhim?\"\"He's either drunk or ill,\" I said.\"He's dying!\" don Juan said with ultimate conviction. \"When we sat down here Icaught a glimpse of his death as it circled around him. That's why I told younot to get up. Rain or shine, you can't get up from this bench until the end.This is the omen we have been waiting for. It is late afternoon. Right now thesun is about to set. It is your hour of power. Look! The view of that man isonly for us.\"He pointed out that from where we sat we had an unobstructed view of the man. Agroup of curious bystanders were gathered in a half circle on the other side ofhim opposite us.The sight of the man lying on the grass became very disturbing to me. He waslean and dark; still young. His black hair was short and curly. His shirt wasunbuttoned and his chest was uncovered. He was wearing an orange cardigansweater with holes in the elbows and some old beat up gray slacks. His shoes, ofsome undefined faded color, were untied. He was rigid. I could not tell whetheror not he was breathing.I wondered if he were dying as don Juan had said; or was don Juan simply usingthe event to make a point? My past experiences with him gave me the certaintythat somehow he was making everything fit into some mysterious scheme of his.After a long silence I turned to him. His eyes were closed. He began to talkwithout opening them.\"That man is about to die now,\" he said. \"You don't believe it, though, do you?\"He opened his eyes and stared at me for a second. His look was so penetratingthat it stunned me.\"No. I don't believe it,\" I said.I really felt that the whole thing was too easy. We had come to sit in the park,and right there, as if everything were being staged, was a man dying.\"The world adjusts itself to itself,\" don Juan said after listening to mydoubts. \"This is not a setup. This is an omen; an act of power.\"The world upheld by reason makes all this into an event that we can watch for amoment on our way to more important things. All we can say about it is that aman is lying on the grass in the park, perhaps drunk.\"The world upheld by will makes it into an act of power which we can see. We cansee death whirling around the man setting its hooks deeper and deeper into hisluminous fibers. We can see the luminous strings losing their tautness andvanishing one by one.\"Those are the two possibilities opened to us luminous beings. You are somewherein the middle still wanting to have everything under the rubric of reason.\"And yet, how can you discard the fact that your personal power rounded up anomen? We came to this park after you had found me where I had been waiting foryou. You found me by just walking into me: without thinking, or planning, ordeliberately using your 'reason'; and after we sat down here to wait for anomen, we became aware of that man. Each of us noticed him in our own way. Youwith your 'reason'. I with my 'will'.\"That dying man is one of the cubic centimeters of chance that power alwaysmakes available to a warrior. The warrior's art is to be perennially [*perennially- repeatedly] fluid in order to pluck it. I have plucked it, but haveyou?\"I could not answer. I became aware of an immense chasm within myself, and for amoment I was somehow cognizant of the two worlds he was talking about.\"What an exquisite omen this is!\" he went on. \"And all for you. Power is showingyou that death is the indispensable ingredient in having to believe. Without theawareness of death, everything is ordinary; trivial. It is only because death isstalking us that the world is an unfathomable mystery. Power has shown you that.\"All I have done myself is to round up the details of the omen so the directionwould be clear to you; but in rounding up the details, I have also shown youthat everything I have said to you today is what I have to believe myselfbecause that is the predilection of my spirit.\"We looked each other in the eye for a moment.\"I remember a poem that you used to read to me,\" he said, moving his eyes to theside. \"About a man who vowed to die in Paris. How does it go?\"The poem was Cesar Vallejo's \"Black Stone on a White Stone.\" I had read andrecited the first two stanzas to don Juan countless times at his request. I will die in Paris while it rains,on a day which I already remember.I will die in Paris- and I do not run away-perhaps in the Autumn, on a Thursday, as it is today. It will be a Thursday, because today,the Thursday that I write these lines,my bones feel the turn,and never so much as today, in all my road,have I seen myself alone. The poem summed up an indescribable melancholy for me.Don Juan whispered that he had to believe that the dying man had had enoughpersonal power to enable him to choose the streets of Mexico City as the placeof his death.\"We're back again to the story of the two cats,\" he said. \"We have to believethat Max became aware of what was stalking him and, like that man over there,had enough power at least to choose the place of his end. But then there was theother cat, just like there are other men whose death will encircle them whilethey are alone, unaware, staring at the walls and ceiling of an ugly barrenroom.\"That man, on the other hand, is dying where he has always lived, in thestreets. Three policemen are his guards of honor. And as he fades away his eyeswill catch a last glimpse of the lights in the stores across the street- thecars, the trees, the throngs of people milling around- and his ears will beflooded for the last time with the sounds of traffic and the voices of men andwomen as they walk by.\"So you see, without an awareness of the presence of our death there is nopower, no mystery.\"I stared at the man for a long time. He was motionless. Perhaps he was dead. Butmy disbelief did not matter any longer. Don Juan was right. Having to believethat the world is mysterious and unfathomable was the expression of a warrior'sinnermost predilection. Without it he had nothing. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Island of the Tonal Don Juan and I met again the next day at the same park around noon. He was stillwearing his brown suit. We sat on a benchl He took off his coat, folded it verycarefully but with an air of supreme casualness, and laid it on the bench. Hiscasualness was very studied and yet it was completely natural. I caught myselfstaring at him. He seemed to be aware of the paradox [* paradox- something thatcontradicts itself] he was presenting to me and smiled. He straightened hisnecktie. He had on a beige long-sleeved shirt. It fit him very well.\"I still have on my suit because I want to tell you something of greatimportance,\" he said, patting me on the shoulder. \"You had a good performanceyesterday. Now it is time to come to some final agreements.\"He paused for a long-moment. He seemed to be preparing a statement. I had astrange feeling in my stomach. My immediate assumption was that he was going totell me the sorcerers' explanation. He stood up a couple of times and paced backand forth in front of me as if it were difficult to voice what he had in mind.\"Let's go to the restaurant across the street and have a bite to eat,\" hefinally said.He unfolded his coat, and before he put it on he showed me that it was fullylined.\"It is made to order,\" he said and smiled as if he were proud of it; as if itmattered.\"I have to call your attention to it or you wouldn't notice it, and it is veryimportant that you are aware of it. You are aware of everything only when youthink you should be. The condition of a warrior, however, is to be aware ofeverything at all times.\"My suit and all this paraphernalia is important because it represents mycondition in life- or rather, the condition of one of the two parts of mytotality. This discussion has been pending. I feel that now is the time to haveit. It has to be done properly, though, or it will never make sense. I wanted mysuit to give you the first clue. I think it has. Now is the time to talk; for inmatters of this topic there is no complete understanding without talking.\"\"What is the topic, don Juan?\"\"The totality of oneself,\" he said.He stood up abruptly and led me to a restaurant in a large hotel across thestreet. A hostess with a rather unfriendly disposition gave us a table inside ina back corner. Obviously the choice places were around the windows.I told don Juan that the woman reminded me of another hostess in a restaurant inArizona where don Juan and I had once gone to eat. She had asked us before shehanded out the menu if we had enough money to pay.\"I don't blame this poor woman either,\" don Juan said, as if sympathizing withher. \"She too, like the other one, is afraid of Mexicans.\"He laughed softly. A couple of people at the adjacent tables turned their headsaround and looked at us.Don Juan said that without knowing, or perhaps even in spite of herself, thehostess had given us the best table in the house; a table where we could talkand I could write to my heart's content.I had just taken my writing pad out of my pocket and put it on the table whenthe waiter suddenly loomed over us. He also seemed to be in a bad mood. He stoodover us with a challenging air.Don Juan proceeded to order a very elaborate meal for himself. He orderedwithout looking at the menu- as if he knew it by heart. I was at a loss. Thewaiter had appeared unexpectedly and I had not had time to read the menu, so Itold him that I would have the same.Don Juan whispered in my ear, \"I bet you that they don't have what I'veordered.\"He stretched his arms and legs, and told me to relax and sit comfortably becausethe meal was going to take forever to be prepared.\"You are at a very poignant crossroad,\" he said. \"Perhaps the last one, and alsoperhaps the most difficult one to understand. Some of the things I am going topoint out to you today will probably never be clear. They are not supposed to beclear anyway. So don't be embarrassed or discouraged. All of us are dumbcreatures when we join the world of sorcery, and to join it doesn't in any senseinsure us that we will change. Some of us remain dumb until the very end.\"I liked it when he included himself among the idiots. I knew that he did not doit out of kindness, but as a didactic [* didactic- excessively instructive]device.\"Don't fret if you don't make sense out of what I'm going to tell you,\" hecontinued. \"Considering your temperament, I'm afraid that you might knockyourself out trying to understand. Don't! What I'm about to say is meant only topoint out a direction.\"I had a sudden feeling of apprehension. Don Juan's admonitions [* admonition-cautionary advice about something imminent] forced me into an endlessspeculation. He had warned me on other occasions in very much the same fashion;and every time he had done so, what he was warning me about had turned out to bea devastating issue.\"It makes me very nervous when you talk to me this way,\" I said.\"I know it,\" he replied calmly. \"I'm deliberately trying to get you on yourtoes. I need your attention; your undivided attention.\"He paused and looked at me, I laughed nervously and involuntarily. I knew thathe was stretching the dramatic possibilities of the situation as far as hecould.\"I'm not telling you all this for effect,\" he said, as if he had read mythoughts. \"I am simply giving you time to make the proper adjustments.\"At that moment the waiter stopped at our table to announce that they did nothave what we had ordered. Don Juan laughed out loud and ordered tortillas andbeans. The waiter chuckled scornfully and said that they did not serve them, andsuggested steak or chicken. We settled for some soup.We ate in silence. I did not like the soup and could not finish it, but don Juanate all of his.\"I have put on my suit,\" he said all of a sudden, \"in order to tell you aboutsomething; something you already know but which needs to be clarified if it isgoing to be effective. I have waited until now because Genaro feels that youhave to be not only willing to undertake the road of knowledge, but your effortsby themselves must be impeccable enough to make you worthy of that knowledge.You have done well. Now I will tell you the sorcerers' explanation.\"He paused again, rubbed his cheeks, and played with his tongue inside his mouthas if he were feeling his teeth.\"I'm going to tell you about the tonal and the nagual\" he said and looked at mepiercingly.This was the first time in our association that he had used those two terms. Iwas vaguely familiar with them through the anthropological literature on thecultures of central Mexico.I knew that the 'tonal' (pronounced, toh-na'hl) was thought to be a kind ofguardian spirit, usually an animal, that a child obtained at birth and withwhich he had intimate ties with for the rest of his life.'Nagual' (pronounced, nah-wa'hl) was the name given to the animal into whichsorcerers could allegedly transform themselves; or to the sorcerer that elicitedsuch a transformation.\"This is my tonal\" don Juan said, rubbing his hands on his chest.\"Your suit?\"\"No. My person.\"He pounded his chest and his thighs and the side of his ribs.\"My tonal is all this.\"He explained that every human being had two sides; two separate entities; twocounterparts which became operative at the moment of birth. One was called the'tonal' and the other the 'nagual'.I told him what anthropologists knew about the two concepts. He let me speakwithout interrupting me.\"Well, whatever you may think you know about them is pure nonsense,\" he said. \"Ibase this statement on the fact that whatever I'm telling you about the tonaland the nagual could not possibly have been told to you before. Any idiot wouldknow that you know nothing about them because in order to be acquainted withthem you would have to be a sorcerer, and you aren't. Or you would've had totalk about them with a sorcerer, and you haven't. So disregard everything you'veheard before because it is inapplicable.\"\"It was only a comment,\" I said.He raised his brows in a comical gesture.\"Your comments are out of order,\" he said. \"This time I need your undividedattention since I am going to acquaint you with the tonal and the nagual.Sorcerers have a special and unique interest in that knowledge. I would say thatthe tonal and the nagual are in the exclusive realm of men of knowledge. In yourcase, this is the lid that closes everything I have taught you. Thus I havewaited until now to talk about them.\"The tonal is not an animal that guards a person. I would rather say that it isa guardian that could be represented as an animal. But that is not the importantpoint.\"He smiled and winked at me.\"I'm using your own words now,\" he said. \"The tonal is the social person.\"He laughed, I supposed, at the sight of my bewilderment.\"The tonal is rightfully so, a protector; a guardian- a guardian that most ofthe time turns into a guard.\"I fumbled with my notebook. I was trying to pay attention to what he was saying.He laughed and mimicked my nervous movements.\"The tonal is the organizer of the world,\" he proceeded. \"Perhaps the best wayof describing its monumental work is to say that on its shoulders rests the taskof setting the chaos of the world in order. It is not farfetched to maintain, assorcerers do, that everything we know and do as men is the work of the tonal.\"At this moment, for instance, what is engaged in trying to make sense out ofour conversation is your tonal. Without it there would be only weird sounds andgrimaces, and you wouldn't understand a thing of what I'm saying.\"I would say then that the tonal is a guardian that protects somethingpriceless; our very being. Therefore an inherent quality of the tonal is to becagey and jealous of its doings. And since its doings are by far the mostimportant part of our lives, it is no wonder that it eventually changes in everyone of us from a guardian into a guard.\"He stopped and asked me if I had understood. I automatically nodded my headaffirmatively, and he smiled with an air of incredulity.\"A guardian is broad-minded and understanding,\" he explained. \"A guard, on theother hand, is a vigilante; narrow-minded and most of the time despotic [*despotic- characteristic of having absolute authority]. I say then that thetonal in all of us has been made into a petty and despotic guard when it shouldbe a broad-minded guardian.\"I definitely was not following the trend of his explanation. I heard and wrotedown every word and yet I seemed to be stuck with some internal dialogue of myown.\"It is very hard for me to follow your point,\" I said.\"If you didn't get hooked on talking to yourself, you would have no quarrels,\"he said cuttingly.His remark threw me into a long explanatory statement. I finally caught myselfand apologized for my insistence on defending myself.He smiled and made a gesture that seemed to indicate that my attitude had notreally annoyed him.\"The tonal is everything we are,\" he proceeded. \"Name it! Anything we have aword for is the tonal. And since the tonal is its own doings, then everything,obviously, has to fall under its domain.\"I reminded him that he had said that the 'tonal' was the social person, a termwhich I myself had used with him to mean a human being as the end result ofsocialization processes. I pointed out that if the 'tonal' was that product, itcould not be everything, as he had said, because the world around us was not theproduct of socialization.Don Juan reminded me that my argument had no basis for him, and that long beforehe had already made the point that there was no world at large but only adescription of the world which we had learned to visualize and take for granted.\"The tonal is everything we know,\" he said. \"I think this in itself is enoughreason for the tonal to be such an overpowering affair.\"He paused for a moment. He seemed to be definitely waiting for comments orquestions, but I had none. Yet I felt obligated to voice a question andstruggled to formulate an appropriate one.I failed. I felt that the admonitions with which he had opened our conversationhad perhaps served as a deterrent to any inquiry on my part. I felt strangelynumb. I could not concentrate and order my thoughts. In fact I felt and knewwithout the shadow of a doubt that I was incapable of thinking. And yet I knewthis without thinking; if that were at all possible.I looked at don Juan. He was staring at the middle part of my body. He liftedhis eyes and my clarity of mind returned instantly.\"The tonal is everything we know,\" he repeated slowly. \"And that includes notonly us as persons, but everything in our world. It can be said that the tonalis everything that meets the eye.\"We begin to groom it at the moment of birth. The moment we take the first gaspof air we also breathe in power for the tonal. So it is proper to say that thetonal of a human being is intimately tied to his birth.\"You must remember this point. It is of great importance in understanding allthis. The tonal begins at birth and ends at death.\"I wanted to recapitulate all the points that he had made. I went as far asopening my mouth to ask him to repeat the salient [* salient- having a qualitythat thrusts itself into attention] points of our conversation, but to myamazement I could not vocalize my words. I was experiencing a most curiousincapacity. My words were heavy and I had no control over that sensation.I looked at don Juan to signal him that I could not talk. He was again staringat the area around my stomach.He lifted his eyes and asked me how I felt. Words poured out of me as if I hadbeen unplugged. I told him that I had been having the peculiar sensation of notbeing able to talk or think, and yet my thoughts had been crystal clear.\"Your thoughts have been crystal clear?\" he asked.I realized then that the clarity had not pertained to my thoughts, but to myperception of the world.\"Are you doing something to me, don Juan?\" I asked.\"I am trying to convince you that your comments are not necessary,\" he said andlaughed.\"You mean you don't want me to ask questions?\"\"No, no. Ask anything you want, but don't let your attention waver.\"I had to admit that I had been distracted by the immensity of the topic.\"I still cannot understand, don Juan, what you mean by the statement that thetonal is everything,\" I said after a moment's pause.\"The tonal is what makes the world.\"\"Is the tonal the creator of the world?\"Don Juan scratched his temples.\"The tonal makes the world only in a manner of speaking. It cannot create orchange anything, and yet it makes the world because its function is to judge,and assess, and witness. I say that the tonal makes the world because itwitnesses and assesses it according to tonal rules. In a very strange manner,the tonal is a creator that doesn't create a thing. In other words, the tonalmakes up the rules by which it apprehends the world. So, in a manner ofspeaking, it creates the world.\"He hummed a popular tune, beating the rhythm with his fingers on the side of hischair. His eyes were shining. They seemed to sparkle. He chuckled, shaking hishead.\"You're not following me,\" he said, smiling.\"I am. I have no problems,\" I said, but I did not sound very convincing.\"The tonal is an island,\" he explained. \"The best way of describing it is to saythat the tonal is this.\"He ran his hand over the table top.\"We can say that the tonal is like the top of this table. An island. And on thisisland we have everything. This island is, in fact, the world.\"There is a personal tonal for every one of us, and there is a collective onefor all of us at any given time which we can call the tonal of the times.\"He pointed to the rows of tables in the restaurant.\"Look! Every table has the same configuration. Certain items are present on allof them. They are, however, individually different from each other. Some tablesare more crowded than others. They have different food on them, differentplates, different atmosphere, yet we have to admit that all the tables in thisrestaurant are very alike.The same thing happens with the tonal. We can say that the tonal of the times iswhat makes us alike in the same way it makes all the tables in this restaurantalike. Each table separately, nevertheless, is an individual case just like thepersonal tonal of each of us. But the important factor to keep in mind is thateverything we know about ourselves and about our world is on the island of thetonal. See what I mean?\"\"If the tonal is everything we know about ourselves and our world, what then isthe nagual?\"\"The nagual is the part of us which we do not deal with at all.\"\"I beg your pardon?\"\"The nagual is the part of us for which there is no description: no words, nonames, no feelings, no knowledge.\"\"That's a contradiction, don Juan. In my opinion, if it can't be felt ordescribed or named, it cannot exist.\"\"It's a contradiction only in your opinion. I warned you before, don't knockyourself out trying to understand this.\"\"Would you say that the nagual is the mind?\"\"No. The mind is an item on the table. The mind is part of the tonal. Let's saythat the mind is the chili sauce.\"He took a bottle of sauce and placed it in front of me.\"Is the nagual the soul?\"\"No. The soul is also on the table. Let's say that the soul is the ashtray.\"\"Is it the thoughts of men?\"\"No. Thoughts are also on the table. Thoughts are like the silverware.\"He picked up a fork and placed it next to the chili sauce and the ashtray.\"Is it a state of grace? Heaven?\"\"Not that either. That, whatever it might be, is also part of the tonal. It is,let's say, the napkin.\"I went on giving possible ways of describing what he was alluding to: pureintellect, psyche, energy, vital force, immortality, life principle. For eachthing I named he found an item on the table to serve as a counterpart and shovedit in front of me until he had all the objects on the table stashed in one pile.Don Juan seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. He giggled and rubbed hishands every time I named another possibility.\"Is the nagual the Supreme Being; the Almighty, God?\" I asked.\"No. God is also on the table. Let's say that God is the tablecloth.\"He made a joking gesture of pulling the tablecloth in order to stack it up withthe rest of the items he had put in front of me.\"But, are you saying that God does not exist?\"\"No. I didn't say that. All I said was that the nagual was not God because Godis an item of our personal tonal and of the tonal of the times. The tonal is, asI've already said, everything we think the world is composed of, including God,of course. God has no more importance other than being a part of the tonal ofour time.\"\"In my understanding, don Juan, God is everything. Aren't we talking about thesame thing?\"\"No. God is only everything you can think of, therefore, properly speaking, heis only another item on the island. God cannot be witnessed at will, he can onlybe talked about.\"The nagual, on the other hand, is at the service of the warrior. It can bewitnessed, but it cannot be talked about.\"\"If the nagual is not any of the things I have mentioned,\" I said, \"perhaps youcan tell me about its location. Where is it?\"Don Juan made a sweeping gesture and pointed to the area beyond the boundariesof the table. He swept his hand, as if with the back of it he were cleaning animaginary surface that went beyond the edges of the table.\"The nagual is there,\" he said. \"There, surrounding the island. The nagual isthere, where power hovers.\"We sense, from the moment we are born, that there are two parts to us. At thetime of birth, and for a while after, we are all nagual. We sense, then, that inorder to function we need a counterpart to what we have. The tonal is missingand that gives us, from the very beginning, a feeling of incompleteness.\"Then the tonal starts to develop and it becomes utterly important to ourfunctioning; so important that it opaques the shine of the nagual. It overwhelmsit. From the moment we become all tonal, we do nothing else but to incrementthat old feeling of incompleteness which accompanies us from the moment of ourbirth, and which tells us constantly that there is another part to give uscompleteness.\"From the moment we become all tonal we begin making pairs. We sense our twosides, but we always represent them with items of the tonal. We say that the twoparts of us are the soul and the body. Or mind and matter. Or good and evil. Godand Satan.\"We never realize, however, that we are merely pairing things on the island,very much like pairing coffee and tea, or bread and tortillas, or chili andmustard. I tell you, we are weird animals. We get carried away, and in ourmadness we believe ourselves to be making perfect sense.\"Don Juan stood up and addressed me as if he were an orator. He pointed his indexfinger at me and made his head shiver.\"Man doesn't move between good and evil,\" he said in a hilariously rhetoricaltone, grabbing the salt and pepper shakers in both hands. \"His true movement isbetween negativeness and positiveness.\"He dropped the salt and pepper and clutched a knife and fork.\"You're wrong! There is no movement,\" he continued as if he were answeringhimself. \"Man is only mind!\"He took the bottle of sauce and held it up. Then he put it down.\"As you can see,\" he said softly, \"we can easily replace chili sauce for mindand end up saying, 'Man is only chili sauce!' Doing that won't make us moredemented than we already are.\"\"I'm afraid I haven't asked the right question,\" I said. \"Maybe we could arriveat a better understanding if I asked what one can specifically find in that areabeyond the island?\"\"There is no way of answering that. If I would say, 'nothing', I would only makethe nagual part of the tonal. All I can say is that there, beyond the island,one finds the nagual\"\"But, when you call it the nagual, aren't you also placing it on the island?\"\"No. I named it only because I wanted to make you aware of it.\"\"All right! But becoming aware of it is the step that has turned the nagual intoa new item of my tonal\"\"I'm afraid you do not understand. I have named the tonal and the nagual as atrue pair. That is all I have done.\"He reminded me that once while trying to explain to him my insistence onmeaning, I had discussed the idea that children might not be capable ofcomprehending the difference between 'father' and 'mother' until they were quitedeveloped in terms of handling meaning. And that they would perhaps believe thatit might be that 'father' wears pants and 'mother' skirts, or other differencesdealing with hairstyle, or size of body, or items of clothing.\"We certainly do the same thing with the two parts of us,\" he said. \"We sensethat there is another side to us. But when we try to pin down that other sidethe tonal gets hold of the baton, and as a director it is quite petty andjealous. It dazzles us with its cunningness and forces us to obliterate theslightest inkling of the other part of the true pair, the nagual.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Day of the Tonal As we left the restaurant I told don Juan that he had been correct in warning meabout the difficulty of the topic, and that my intellectual prowess wasinadequate to grasp his concepts and explanations. I suggested that perhaps if Iwould go to my hotel and read my notes, my comprehension of the subject mightimprove. He tried to put me at ease. He said that I was worrying about words.While he was speaking I experienced a shiver, and for an instant I sensed thatthere was indeed another area within me.I mentioned to don Juan that I was having some inexplicable feelings. Mystatement apparently aroused his curiosity. I told him that I had had the samefeelings before, and that they seemed to be momentary lapses; interruptions inmy flow of awareness. They always manifested themselves as a jolt in my bodyfollowed by the sensation that I was suspended in something.We headed for downtown, walking leisurely. Don Juan asked me to relate all thedetails of my lapses. I had a hard time describing them beyond the point ofcalling them moments of forgetfulness, or absent-mindedness, or not watchingwhat I was doing.He patiently rebuffed me. He pointed out that I was a demanding person, had anexcellent memory, and was very careful in my actions. It had occurred to me atfirst that those peculiar lapses were associated with stopping the internaldialogue, but I also had had them when I had talked to myself extensively. Theyseemed to stem from an area independent of everything I knew.Don Juan patted me on the back. He smiled with apparent delight.\"You're finally beginning to make real connections,\" he said.I asked him to explain his cryptic statement, but he abruptly stopped ourconversation and signaled me to follow him to a small park in front of a church.\"This is the end of our journey to downtown,\" he said and sat down on a bench.\"Right here we have an ideal spot to watch people. There are some who walk by onthe street and others who come to church. From here we can see everyone.\"He pointed to a wide business street and to the gravel walk leading to the stepsof the church. Our bench was located midway between the church and the street.\"This is my very favorite bench,\" he said, caressing the wood.He winked at me and added with a grin, \"It likes me. That's why no one wassitting on it. It knew I was coming.\"\"The bench knew that?\"\"No! Not the bench. My nagual.\"\"Does the nagual have consciousness? Is it aware of things?\"\"Of course. It is aware of everything. That's why I'm interested in youraccount. What you call lapses and feelings is the nagual. In order to talk aboutit we must borrow from the island of tbe tonal. Therefore it is more convenientnot to explain it but to simply recount its effects.\"I wanted to say something else about those peculiar feelings, but he hushed me.\"No more. Today is not the day of the nagual, today is the day of the tonal\" hesaid. \"I put on my suit because today I am all tonal.\"He stared at me. I was about to tell him that the subject was proving to be moredifficult than anything he had ever explained to me. He seemed to haveanticipated my words.\"It is difficult,\" he continued. \"I know it. But considering that this is thefinal lid- the last stage of what I've been teaching you- it is not toofarfetched to say that it envelops everything I mentioned since the first day wemet.\"We remained quiet for a long while. I felt that I had to wait for him to resumehis explanation, but I had a sudden attack of apprehension and hurriedly asked,\"Are the nagual and the tonal within ourselves?\"He looked at me piercingly.\"Very difficult question,\" he said. \"You yourself would say that they are withinourselves. I myself would say that they are not, but neither of us would beright. The tonal of your time calls for you to maintain that everything dealingwith your feelings and thoughts takes place within yourself. The sorcerers'tonal says the opposite: everything is outside. Who's right? No one. Inside,outside, it doesn't really matter.\"I raised a point. I said that when he talked about the 'tonal' and the 'nagual'it sounded as if there was still a third part. He had said that the tonal'forces us' to perform acts. I asked him to tell me who he was referring to asbeing forced.He did not answer me directly.\"To explain all this is not that simple,\" he said. \"No matter how clever thecheckpoints of the tonal are, the fact of the matter is that the nagualsurfaces. Its coming to the surface is always inadvertent, though. The tonal'sgreat art is to suppress any manifestation of the nagual in such a manner thateven if its presence should be the most obvious thing in the world, it isunnoticeable.\"\"For whom is it unnoticeable?\"He chuckled, shaking his head up and down. I pressed him for an answer.\"For the tonal\" he said. \"I'm speaking about it exclusively. I may go around incircles, but that shouldn't surprise or annoy you. I warned you about thedifficulty of understanding what I have to tell. I went through all thatrigamarole because my tonal is aware that it is speaking about itself.\"In other words, my tonal is using itself in order to understand the informationI want your tonal to be clear about. Let's say that the tonal, since it iskeenly aware of how taxing it is to speak of itself, has created the terms 'I,''myself,' and so forth as a balance and thanks to them it can talk with othertonals, or with itself, about itself.\"Now when I say that the tonal forces us to do something, I don't mean thatthere is a third party there. Obviously it forces itself to follow its ownjudgments.\"On certain occasions, however, or under certain special circumstances,something in the tonal itself becomes aware that there is more to us. It is likea voice that comes from the depths; the voice of the nagual. You see, thetotality of ourselves is a natural condition which the tonal cannot obliteratealtogether, and there are moments, especially in the life of a warrior, when thetotality becomes apparent. At those moments one can surmise and assess what wereally are.\"I was concerned with those jolts you have had because that is the way thenagual surfaces. At those moments the tonal becomes aware of the totality ofoneself. It is always a jolt because that awareness disrupts the lull. I callthat awareness the totality of the being that is going to die. The idea is thatat the moment of death the other member of the true pair, the nagual, becomesfully operative and the awareness and memories and perceptions stored in ourcalves and thighs, in our back and shoulders and neck, begin to expand anddisintegrate. Like the beads of an endless broken necklace, they fall asunderwithout the binding force of life.\"He looked at me. His eyes were peaceful. I felt ill at ease, stupid.\"The totality of ourselves is a very tacky affair,\" he said. \"We need only avery small portion of it to fulfill the most complex tasks of life. Yet when wedie, we die with the totality of ourselves. A sorcerer asks the question, 'Ifwe're going to die with the totality of ourselves, why not, then, live with thattotality?' \"He signaled me with his head to watch the scores of people that went by.\"They're all tonal\" he said. \"I am going to single some of them out so yourtonal will assess them, and in assessing them it will assess itself.\"He directed my attention to two old ladies that had emerged from the church.They stood at the top of the limestone steps for a moment and then began to walkdown with infinite care, resting on every step.\"Watch those two women very carefully,\" he said. \"But don't see them as persons,or as faces that hold things in common with us. See them as tonals\"The two women got to the bottom of the steps. They moved as if the rough gravelwere marbles and they were about to roll and lose their balance on them. Theywalked arm in arm, propping each other up with the weight of their bodies.\"Look at them!\" don Juan said in a low voice. \"Those women are the best exampleof the most miserable tonal one can find.\"I noticed that the two women were small-boned but fat. They were perhaps intheir early fifties. They had a painful look in their faces, as if walking downthe church steps had been beyond their strength.They were in front of us. They vacillated for a moment, and then they came to ahalt. There was one more step on the gravel walk.\"Watch your step, ladies,\" don Juan shouted as he stood up dramatically.The women looked at him; apparently confused by his sudden outburst.\"My mom broke her hip right there the other day,\" he added and dashed over tohelp them.They thanked him profusely and he advised them that if they ever lost theirbalance and fell down, they had to remain motionless on the spot until theambulance came. His tone was sincere and convincing. The women crossedthemselves.Don Juan sat down again. His eyes were beaming. He spoke softly.\"Those women are not that old and their bodies are not that weak, and yet theyare decrepit. Everything about them is dreary: their clothes, their smell, theirattitude. Why do you think that's so?\"\"Maybe they were born that way,\" I said.\"No one is born that way. We make ourselves that way. The tonal of those womenis weak and timid.\"I said that today was going to be the day of the tonal. I meant that today Iwant to deal with it exclusively. I also said that I had put on my suit for thatspecific purpose. With it I wanted to show you that a warrior treats his tonalin a very special manner. I've pointed out to you that my suit has been made toorder, and that everything I have on today fits me to perfection. It is not myvanity that I wanted to show, but my warrior's spirit; my warrior's tonal.\"Those two women gave you your first view of the tonal today. Life can be asmerciless with you as it is with them if you are careless with your tonal. I putmyself as the counterpoint. If you understand correctly I should not need tostress this point.\"I had a sudden attack of uncertainty and asked him to spell out what I shouldhave understood.I must have sounded desperate. He laughed out loud.\"Look at that young man in green pants and a pink shirt,\" don Juan whisperedpointing to a very thin and very dark complexioned, sharp-featured young man whowas standing almost in front of us.He seemed to be undecided whether to go towards the church or towards thestreet. Twice he raised his hand in the direction of the church as though hewere talking to himself and was about to start moving towards it. Then he staredat me with a blank expression.\"Look at the way he's dressed,\" don Juan said in a whisper. \"Look at thoseshoes!\"The young man's clothes were tattered and wrinkled, and his shoes were inabsolute pieces.\"He's obviously very poor,\" I said.\"Is that all you can say about him?\" he asked.I enumerated a series of reasons that might have accounted for the young man'sshabbiness: poor health, bad luck, indolence, indifference to his personalappearance, or the chance that he may have just been released from prison.Don Juan said that I was merely speculating, and that he was not interested injustifying anything by suggesting that the man was a victim of unconquerableforces.\"Maybe he's a secret agent made to look like a bum,\" I said jokingly.The young man walked away towards the street with a disjointed gait.\"He's not made to look like a bum. He is a bum,\" don Juan said. \"Look how weakhis body is. His arms and legs are thin. He can hardly walk. No one can pretendto look that way. There is something definitely wrong with him; not hiscircumstances though. I have to stress again that I want you to see that man asa tonal\"\"What does it entail to see a man as a tonal?\"\"It entails to cease judging him in a moral sense, or excusing him on thegrounds that he is like a leaf at the mercy of the wind. In other words, itentails seeing a man without thinking that he is hopeless or helpless.\"You know exactly what I am talking about. You can assess that young man withoutcondemning or forgiving him.\"\"He drinks too much,\" I said.My statement was not volitional. I just made it without really knowing why. Foran instant I even felt that someone standing behind me had voiced the words. Iwas moved to explain that my statement was another of my speculations.\"That was not the case,\" don Juan said. \"Your tone of voice had a certainty thatyou lacked before. You didn't say, 'Maybe he's a drunkard.'\"I felt embarrassed although I could not exactly determine why. Don Juan laughed.\"You saw through the man,\" he said. \"That was seeing. Seeing is like that.Statements are made with great certainty, and one doesn't know how it happened.\"You know that young man's tonal was shot, but you don't know how you know it.\"I had to admit that somehow I had had that impression.\"You're right,\" don Juan said. \"It doesn't really matter that he's young. He'sas decrepit as the two women. Youth is in no way a barrier against thedeterioration of the tonal.\"You thought that there might be a great many reasons for that man's condition.I find that there is only one; his tonal. It is not that his tonal is weakbecause he drinks. It is the other way around. He drinks because his tonal isweak. That weakness forces him to be what he is. But the same thing happens toall of us in one form or another.\"\"But aren't you also justifying his behavior by saying that it's his tonal?\"\"I'm giving you an explanation that you have never encountered before. It is nota justification or a condemnation though. That young man's tonal is weak andtimid. And yet he's not unique. All of us are more or less in the same boat.\"At that moment a very large man passed in front of us heading towards thechurch. He was wearing an expensive dark gray business suit and was carrying abriefcase. The collar of his shirt was unbuttoned and his necktie loose. He wassweating profusely. He had a very light complexion which made the perspirationall the more obvious.\"Watch him!\" don Juan ordered me.The man's steps were small but heavy. There was a wobbling quality to hiswalking. He did not go up to the church. He circumvented it and disappearedbehind it.\"There is no need to treat the body in such an awful manner,\" don Juan said witha note of scorn. \"But the sad fact is that all of us have learned to perfectionhow to make our tonal weak. I have called that indulging.\"He put his hand on my notebook and did not let me write any more. His rationalewas that as long as I kept on taking notes I was incapable of concentrating. Hesuggested I should relax, shut off the internal dialogue, and let go; mergingwith the person being observed.I asked him to explain what he meant by 'merging.' He said there was no way toexplain it; that it was something that the body felt or did when put inobservational contact with other bodies. He then clarified the issue by sayingthat in the past he had called that process 'seeing' and that it consisted of alull of true silence within followed by an outward elongation of something inthe self; an elongation that met and merged with the other body, or withanything within one's field of awareness.At that point I wanted to get back to my writing pad, but he stopped me andbegan to single out different people from the crowd that passed by.He pointed out dozens of persons covering a wide range of types among men, womenand children of various ages. Don Juan said that he had selected persons whoseweak 'tonal' could fit into a categorization scheme, and thus he had acquaintedme with a preconceived variety of indulging.I did not remember all the people he had pointed out and discussed. I complainedthat if I had taken notes I could have at least sketched out the intricacies ofhis schemata on indulging. As it was he did not want to repeat it, or perhaps hedid not remember it either.He laughed and said that he did not remember it, because in the life of asorcerer it was the 'nagual' that was accountable for creativity.He looked at the sky and said that it was getting late, and that from thatmoment on we were going to change direction. Instead of weak 'tonals' we weregoing to wait for the appearance of a 'proper tonal'. He added that only awarrior had a 'proper tonal', and that the average man, at best, could have a'right tonal'.After a few minutes' wait he slapped his thigh and chuckled.\"Look who's coming now,\" he said, pointing to the street with a movement of hischin. \"It is as if they were made to order.\"I saw three male Indians approaching. They had on some short brown woolenponchos, white pants that came to their mid calf, long-sleeved white tops, dirtyworn-out sandals, and old straw hats. Each of them carried a bundle tied to hisback.Don Juan stood up and went to meet them. He spoke to them. They seemed surprisedand surrounded him. They smiled at him. He was apparently telling them somethingabout me. The three of them turned around and smiled at me. They were about tenor twelve feet away. I listened carefully but I could not hear what they weresaying.Don Juan reached in his pocket and handed them some bills. They appeared to bepleased. They moved their feet nervously. I liked them very much. They lookedlike children. All of them had small white teeth and very pleasing mildfeatures.One, by all appearances the oldest, had whiskers. His eyes were tired but verykind. He took off his hat and came closer to the bench. The others followed him.The three of them greeted me in unison. We shook hands. Don Juan told me to givethem some money. They thanked me, and after a polite silence they said good-by.Don Juan sat back down on the bench and we watched them disappear in the crowd.I told don Juan that for some strange reason I had liked them very much.\"It isn't so strange,\" he said. \"You must've felt that their tonal is justright. It is right, but not for our time.\"You probably felt they were like children. They are. And that is very tough. Iunderstand them better than you, thus I couldn't help but feel a tinge ofsadness. Indians are like dogs, they have nothing. But that is the nature oftheir fortune and I shouldn't feel sad. My sadness, of course, is my own way ofindulging.\"\"Where are they from, don Juan?\"\"From the Sierras. They've come here to seek their fortune. They want to becomemerchants. They're brothers. I told them that I also came from the Sierras andI'm a merchant myself. I said that you were my partner. The money we gave themwas a token. A warrior should give tokens like that all the time. They no doubtneed the money, but need should not be an essential consideration for a token.The thing to look for is feeling. I personally was moved by those three.\"Indians are the losers of our time. Their downfall began with the Spaniards,and now under the reign of their descendants the Indians have lost everything.It is not an exaggeration to say that the Indians have lost their tonal\"\"Is that a metaphor, don Juan?\"\"No. It is a fact. The tonal is very vulnerable. It cannot withstandmaltreatment. The white man, from the day he set foot on this land, hassystematically destroyed not only the Indian tonal of the time, but also thepersonal tonal of every Indian. One can easily surmise [* surmise- solve byguessing from incomplete evidence] that for the poor average Indian the reign ofthe white man has been sheer hell. And yet the irony is that for another kind ofIndian it has been sheer bliss.\"\"Who are you talking about? What kind of Indian is that?\"\"The sorcerer. For the sorcerer, the Conquest was the challenge of a lifetime.They were the only ones who were not destroyed by it. They adapted to it andused it to their ultimate advantage.\"\"How was that possible, don Juan? I was under the impression that the Spaniardsleft no stone unturned.\"\"Let's say that they turned over all the stones that were within the limits oftheir own tonal. In the Indian life, however, there were things that wereincomprehensible to the white man. Those things he did not even notice. Perhapsit was the sheer luck of the sorcerers or perhaps it was their knowledge thatsaved them. After the tonal of the time and the personal tonal of every Indianwas obliterated, the sorcerers found themselves holding on to the only thingleft uncontested; the nagual.\"In other words, their tonal took refuge in their nagual. This couldn't havehappened had it not been for the excruciating conditions of a vanquished people.The men of knowledge of today are the product of those conditions, and are theultimate connoisseurs [* - an expert able to appreciate a branch of knowledge]of the nagual since they were left there thoroughly alone. There, the white manhas never ventured. In fact, he doesn't even have the idea it exists.\"I felt compelled at that point to present an argument. I sincerely contendedthat in European thought we had accounted for what he called the 'nagual'.I brought in the concept of the Transcendental Ego, or the unobserved observerpresent in all our thoughts, perceptions, and feelings. I explained to don Juanthat the individual could perceive or intuit himself as a self through theTranscendental Ego because this was the only thing capable of judgment; capableof disclosing reality within the realm of its consciousness.Don Juan was unruffled. He laughed.\"Disclosing reality,\" he said, mimicking me. \"That's the tonal.\"I argued that the 'tonal' may be called the Empirical Ego found in one's passingstream of consciousness or experience, while the Transcendental Ego was foundbehind that stream.\"Watching, I suppose,\" he said mockingly.\"That's right. Watching itself,\" I said.\"I hear you talking,\" he said. \"But you're saying nothing. The nagual is notexperience or intuition or consciousness. Those terms and everything else youmay care to say are only items on the island of the tonal. The nagual, on theother hand, is only effect. The tonal begins at birth and ends at death, but thenagual never ends. The nagual has no limit. I've said that the nagual is wherepower hovers.\"That was only a way of alluding to it. By reasons of its effect, perhaps, thenagual can be best understood in terms of power. For instance, when you feltnumb and couldn't talk earlier today, I was actually soothing you. That is, mynagual was acting upon you.\"\"How was that possible, don Juan?\"\"You won't believe this, but no one knows how. All I know is that I wanted yourundivided attention, and then my nagual went to work on you. I know that muchbecause I can witness its effect, but I don't know how it works.\"He was quiet for a while. I wanted to keep on the same topic. I attempted to aska question. He silenced me.\"One can say that the nagual accounts for creativity,\" he finally said andlooked at me piercingly. \"The nagual is the only part of us that can create.\"He remained quiet, looking at me. I felt he was definitely leading me into anarea I had wished he would elucidate [* elucidate- make clear nad free fromconfusion] further. He had said that the 'tonal' did not create anything, butonly witnessed and assessed. I asked how he explained the fact that we constructsuperb structures and machines.\"That's not creativity,\" he said. \"That's only molding. We can mold anythingwith our hands; personally or in conjunction with the hands of other tonals. Agroup of tonals can mold anything; superb structures as you said.\"\"But what's creativity then, don Juan?\"He stared at me, squinting his eyes. He chuckled softly, lifted his right handover his head and twisted his wrist with a sharp jerk, as if he were turning adoor knob.\"Creativity is this,\" he said and brought his hand with a cupped palm to thelevel of my eyes.It took me an incredibly long time to focus my eyes on his hand. I felt that atransparent membrane was holding my whole body in a fixed position, and that Ihad to break it in order to place my sight on his hand.I struggled until beads of perspiration ran into my eyes. Finally I heard orfelt a pop, and my eyes and head jerked free.On his right palm there was the most curious rodent I had ever seen. It lookedlike a bushy-tailed squirrel. The tail, however, was more like a porcupine's. Ithad stiff quills.\"Touch it!\" don Juan said softly.I automatically obeyed him and ran my finger on its soft back. Don Juan broughthis hand closer to my eyes and then I noticed something that threw me intonervous spasms. The squirrel had eyeglasses and big teeth.\"It looks like a Japanese,\" I said and began to laugh hysterically.The rodent then started to grow in don Juan's palm. And while my eyes were stillfilled with tears of laughter, the rodent became so enormous that itdisappeared. It literally went out of the frame of my vision. It happened sorapidly that I was caught in the middle of a spasm of laughter. When I lookedagain, or when I wiped my eyes and focused them properly, I was looking at donJuan. He was sitting on the bench, and I was standing in front of him although Idid not remember having stood up.For a moment my nervousness was uncontainable. Don Juan calmly got up, forced meto sit, propped my chin between the bicep and forearm of his left arm and hit meon the very top of my head with the knuckles of his right hand. The effect waslike the jolt of an electric current. It calmed me down immediately.There were so many things that I wanted to ask, but my words could not wadethrough all those thoughts. I then became keenly aware that I had lost controlover my vocal cords. I did not want to struggle to speak, however, and leanedagainst the back of the bench. Don Juan said forcefully that I had to pullmyself together and stop indulging. I felt a bit dizzy. He imperatively orderedme to write my notes, and handed me my pad and pencil after picking them up fromunderneath the bench.I made a supreme effort to say something and again I had the clear sensationthat a membrane was enveloping me. I puffed and groaned for a moment, while donJuan laughed, until I heard or felt another pop.I began to write immediately. Don Juan spoke as if he were dictating to me.\"One of the acts of a warrior is never to let anything affect him,\" he said.\"Thus a warrior may be seeing the devil himself, but he won't let anyone knowthat. The control of a warrior has to be impeccable.\"He waited until I had finished writing and then asked me laughingly, \"Did youget all that?\"I suggested that we should go to a restaurant and have dinner. I was famished.He said that we had to stay until the 'proper tonal' appeared. He added in aserious tone that if the 'proper tonal' did not come that day we had to remainon the bench until it cared to show up.\"What is a proper tonal?\" I asked.\"A tonal that is just right, balanced and harmonious. You are supposed to findone today- or rather your power is supposed to bring one to us.\"\"But how can I tell it apart from other tonals?\"\"Never mind that. I will point it out to you.\"\"What is it like, don Juan?\"\"Hard to tell. It depends on you. This is a show for you, therefore you will setup those conditions yourself.\"\"How?\"\"I don't know that. Your power- your nagual will do that.\"There are roughly speaking, two sides to every tonal. One is the outer part:the fringe; the surface of the island. That's the part related to action andacting; the rugged side. The other part is 'decision and judgment'- the innertonal- softer, more delicate and more complex.\"The proper tonal is a tonal where the two levels are in perfect harmony andbalance.\"Don Juan stopped talking. It was fairly dark by then and I had a hard timetaking notes. He told me to stretch and relax. He said that it had been quite anexhausting day but very prolific [* prolific- productive in abundance] and thathe was sure the proper tonal would show up.Dozens of people went by. We sat in a relaxed silence for ten or fifteenminutes. Then don Juan stood up abruptly.\"By golly you've done it! Look what's coming there. A girl!\"He pointed with a nod of his head to a young woman who was crossing the park andwas approaching the vicinity of our bench. Don Juan said that that young womanwas the 'proper tonal' and that if she would stop to talk to either one of us itwould be an extraordinary omen and we would have to do whatever she wanted.I could not clearly distinguish the young woman's features, although there wasstill enough light. She came within a couple of feet, but went by withoutlooking at us. Don Juan ordered me in a whisper to get up and go talk to her.I ran after her and asked for directions. I got very close to her. She wasyoung, perhaps in her mid-twenties, of medium height, very attractive andwell-groomed. Her eyes were clear and peaceful. She smiled at me as I spoke.There was something winning about her. I liked her as much as I had liked thethree Indians.I went back to the bench and sat down.\"Is she a warrior?\" I asked.\"Not quite,\" don Juan said. \"Your power is not that keen yet to bring a warrior.But she's a just right tonal. One that could turn into a proper tonal. Warriorscome from that stock.\"His statements aroused my curiosity. I asked him if women could be warriors. Helooked at me; apparently baffled by my question.\"Of course they can,\" he said, \"and they are even better equipped for the pathof knowledge than men. But then men are a bit more resilient. [* resilient- ableto recover readily from misfortune] I would say, however, that all in all, womenhave a slight advantage.\"I said that it puzzled me that we had never talked about women in relation tohis knowledge.\"You're a man,\" he said, \"therefore I use the masculine gender when I talk toyou. That's all. The rest is the same.\"I wanted to question him further but he made a gesture to close the topic. Helooked up. The sky was almost black. The banks of clouds looked extremely dark.There were still, however, some areas where the clouds were slightly orange.\"The end of the day is your best time,\" don Juan said. \"The appearance of thatyoung woman at the very edge of the day is an omen. We were talking about thetonal, therefore it is an omen about your tonal.\"\"What does the omen mean, don Juan?\"\"It means that you have very little time left to organize your arrangements. Anyarrangements that you might have constructed have to be viable arrangementsbecause you don't have time to make new ones. Your arrangements must work now orthey are not arrangements at all.\"I suggest that when you go back home you check your lines and make sure theyare strong. You will need them.\"\"What's going to happen to me, don Juan?\"\"Years ago you bid for power. You have followed the hardships of learningfaithfully, without fretting or rushing. You are now at the edge of the day.\"\"What does that mean?\"\"For a proper tonal everything on the island of the tonal is a challenge.Another way of saying it is that for a warrior everything in this world is achallenge. The greatest challenge of all, of course, is his bid for power. Butpower comes from the nagual, and when a warrior finds himself at the edge of theday it means that the hour of the nagual is approaching; the warrior's hour ofpower.\"\"I still don't understand the meaning of all this, don Juan. Does it mean that Iam going to die soon?\"\"If you're stupid, you will,\" he retorted cuttingly. \"But putting it in milderterms it means that you're about to shiver in your pants. You bid for power onceand that bidding is irreversible. I won't say that you're about to fulfill yourdestiny because there is no destiny. The only thing that one can say then isthat you're about to fulfill your power. The omen was clear. That young womancame to you at the edge of the day. You have little time left and none of it forcrap. A fine state. I would say that the best of us always comes out when we areagainst the wall; when we feel the sword dangling overhead. Personally Iwouldn't have it any other way.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"Shrinking the Tonal On Wednesday morning I left my hotel around nine forty-five. I walked slowlyallowing myself fifteen minutes to reach the place where don Juan and I hadagreed to meet. He had picked a corner on the Paseo de la Reforma five or sixblocks away in front of the ticket office of an airline.I had just finished eating breakfast with a friend of mine. He had wanted towalk with me, but I had insinuated that I was going to meet a girl. Ideliberately walked on the opposite side of the street from where the airlineoffice was. I had the nagging suspicion that my friend, who had always wanted meto introduce him to don Juan, knew that I was going to meet him and might befollowing me. I was afraid that if I turned around I would find him behind me.I saw don Juan at a magazine stand on the other side of the street. I started tocross over but had to stop on the divider and wait there until it was safe towalk all the way across the wide boulevard. I turned around casually to see ifmy friend was following me. He was standing on the corner behind me. He smiledsheepishly and waved his hand as if telling me that he had been incapable ofcontrolling himself. I dashed across the street without giving him time to catchup with me.Don Juan seemed to be aware of my predicament. When I reached him he gave afurtive glance over my shoulder.\"He's coming,\" he said. \"We'd better go down the side street.\"He pointed to a street which cut diagonally into the Paseo de la Reforma at thepoint where we were standing. I quickly oriented myself. I had never been onthat street, but two days before I had been in the airline ticket office.I knew its peculiar layout. The office was on the pointed corner made by the twostreets. It had a door opening onto each street and the distance between the twodoors must have been about ten to twelve feet. There was an aisle through theoffice from door to door, and a person could easily go from one street to theother. There were desks on one side of that pathway and a large round counterwith clerks and cashiers on the other side. The day I had been there the placehad been filled with people.I wanted to hurry up, perhaps even run, but don Juan's pace was relaxed. As wereached the office door on the diagonal street, I knew without having to turnaround that my friend had also run across the boulevard and was about to turninto the street where we were walking. I looked at don Juan; hoping that he hada solution. He shrugged his shoulders.I felt annoyed and could not think of anything myself short of punching myfriend in the nose. I must have sighed or exhaled at that very moment becausethe next thing I felt was sudden loss of air due to a formidable shove that donJuan had given me which sent me whirling through the door of the airline office.Propelled by his tremendous push I practically flew into the room. Don Juan hadcaught me so unprepared that my body had not offered any resistance. My frightmerged with the actual jolt of his thrust. I automatically put my arms in frontof me to protect my face.The force of don Juan's shove had been so great that saliva flew out of my mouthand I experienced a mild vertigo as I stumbled inside the room. I nearly lost mybalance and had to make a supreme effort not to fall down. I twirled around acouple of times. It seemed that the speed of my movements made the scene blurry.I vaguely noticed a crowd of customers conducting their business. I feltextremely embarrassed. I knew that everyone was looking at me as I reeled acrossthe room.The idea that I was making a fool out of myself was more than discomforting. Aseries of thoughts flashed through my mind. I had the certainty that I was goingto fall on my face; or I would bump into a customer, perhaps an old lady, whowould be injured by the impact; or worse yet, the glass door at the other endwould be closed and I would smash against it.In a dazed state I reached the door to the Paseo de la Reforma. It was open andI stepped out. My preoccupation of the moment was that I had to keep cool, turnto my right and walk on the boulevard towards downtown as if nothing hadhappened. I was sure that don Juan would join me, and that perhaps my friendmight have kept on walking along the diagonal street.I opened my eyes; or rather I focused them on the area in front of me. I had along moment of numbness before I fully realized what had happened. I was not onthe Paseo de la Reforma, as I should have been, but in the Lagunilla market oneand a half miles away.What I experienced at the moment of that realization was such an intenseastonishment that all I could do was stare; stupefied.I looked around in order to orient myself. I realized that I was actuallystanding very close to where I had met don Juan on my first day in Mexico City.Perhaps I was even on the same spot. The stands that sold old coins were fivefeet away. I made a supreme effort to take hold of myself. Obviously I had to beexperiencing a hallucination. It could not possibly be any other way.I quickly turned to go back through the door into the office, but behind methere was only a row of stands with secondhand books and magazines. Don Juan wasstanding next to me, to my right. He had an enormous smile on his face.There was a pressure in my head; a tickling feeling as if carbonated soda weregoing through my nose. I was speechless. I tried to say something withoutsuccess.I clearly heard don Juan say that I should not try to talk or think, but Iwanted to say something; anything. An awful nervousness was building up insidemy chest. I felt tears rolling down my cheeks.Don Juan did not shake me as he usually does when I fall prey to anuncontrollable fear. Instead he patted me gently on the head.\"Now, now, little Carlos,\" he said. \"Don't lose your marbles.\"He held my face in his hands for an instant.\"Don't try to talk,\" he said.He let my face go and pointed to what was taking place all around us.\"This is not for talking,\" he said. \"This is only for watching. Watch! Watcheverything!\"I was really crying. My reaction to my crying was very strange however. I kepton weeping without any concern. It did not matter to me, at that moment, whetheror not I was making a fool out of myself.I looked around. Right in front of me there was a middle-aged man wearing a pinkshort-sleeved shirt and dark gray pants. He seemed to be an American. A chubbywoman, apparently his wife, was holding on to his arm. The man was handling somecoins, while a thirteen or fourteen year old boy, perhaps the son of theproprietor, watched him. The boy followed every movement the older man made.Finally the man put the coins back on the table and the boy immediately relaxed.\"Watch everything!\" don Juan demanded again.There was nothing unusual to watch. People were passing by going in everydirection. I turned around. A man who appeared to run the magazine stand wasstaring at me. He blinked repeatedly as if he were about to fall asleep. Heseemed tired or sick, and looked seedy.I felt that there was nothing to watch; at least nothing of real consequence. Istared at the scene. I found that it was impossible to concentrate my attentionon anything. Don Juan walked in a circle around me. He acted as if he wereassessing something in me. He shook his head and puckered his lips.\"Come, come,\" he said, grabbing me gently by the arm. \"It's time to walk.\"As soon as we began to move I noticed that my body was very light. In fact Ifelt that the soles of my feet were spongy. They had a peculiar rubbery,springing quality.Don Juan must have been aware of my sensations. He held me tightly as if not tolet me escape. He pressed down on me as though he were afraid I would moveupwards beyond his reach like a balloon.Walking made me feel better. My nervousness gave way to a comfortable easiness.Don Juan insisted again that I should observe everything. I told him that therewas nothing I wanted to watch; that it made no difference to me what people weredoing in the market; and that I did not want to feel like an idiot dutifullyobserving some moronic activity of someone buying coins and old books while thereal thing was escaping through my fingers.\"What is the real thing?\" he asked.I stopped walking and vehemently told him that the important thing was whateverhe had done to make me perceive that I had covered the distance between theticket office and the market in seconds.At that point I began to shiver and felt I was going to get ill. Don Juan mademe put my hands against my stomach.He pointed all around him and stated again, in a matter-of-fact tone, that themundane activity around us was the only thing of importance.I felt annoyed with him. I had the physical feeling of spinning. I took a deepbreath.\"What did you do, don Juan?\" I asked with forced casualness.With a reassuring tone he said that he could tell me about that any time, butthat whatever was happening all around me was not ever going to be repeated.I had no quarrel with that. The activity I was witnessing obviously could not berepeated again in all its complexity. My point was that I could observe a verysimilar activity any time. On the other hand, the implication of having beentransported over the distance, in whatever form, was of immeasurablesignificance.When I voiced these opinions don Juan made his head shiver as if what he hadheard me say was actually painful to him.We walked in silence for a moment. My body was feverish. I noticed that thepalms of my hands and the soles of my feet were burning hot. The same unusualheat also seemed to be localized in my nostrils and eyelids.\"What did you do, don Juan?\" I asked him pleadingly.He did not answer me but patted me on the chest and laughed. He said that menwere very frail creatures, who made themselves even more frail with theirindulging. In a very serious tone he exhorted me not to feel that I was about toperish, but to push myself beyond my limits; and to simply engage my attentionon the world around me.We continued walking at a very slow pace. My preoccupation was paramount. Icould not pay attention to anything. Don Juan stopped and seemed to deliberatewhether or not to speak. He opened his mouth to say something, but then heappeared to change his mind and we began to walk again.\"What happened is that you came here,\" he said abruptly as he turned and staredat me.\"How did that happen?\"He said that he did not know, and that the only thing he did know was that I hadselected that place myself.Our impasse became even more hopeless as we kept on talking. I wanted to knowthe steps and he insisted that the selection of the place was the only thing wecould discuss, and since I did not know why I had chosen it, there wasessentially nothing to talk about. He criticized, without getting angry, myobsession to reason out everything as an unnecessary indulging. He said that itwas simpler and more effective just to act without seeking explanations, andthat by talking about my experience and by thinking about it I was dissipatingit.After a few moments he said that we had to leave that place because I hadspoiled it and it would become increasingly injurious to me.We left the market and walked to the Alameda Park. I was exhausted. I plunkeddown on a bench. It was only then that it occurred to me to look at my watch. Itwas 10:20 a.m. I had to make quite an effort in order to focus my attention. Idid not remember the exact time when I had met don Juan. I calculated that itmust have been around ten. And it could not have taken us more than ten minutesto walk from the market to the park, which left only ten minutes unaccountedfor.I told don Juan about my calculations. He smiled. I had the certainty that hissmile hid his contempt for me, yet there was nothing in his face to betray thatfeeling.\"You think I'm a hopeless idiot, don't you, don Juan?\"\"Ah ha!\" he said and jumped to his feet.His reaction was so unexpected that I also jumped up at the same time.\"Tell me exactly what you think my feelings are,\" he said emphatically. [*emphatically- without question and beyond doubt]I felt I knew his feelings. It was as if I were feeling them myself. But when Itried to say what I felt, I realized I could not talk about it. To speakrequired a tremendous effort.Don Juan said that I did not have enough power yet to 'see' him. But I couldcertainly 'see' enough to find myself suitable explanations for what washappening.\"Don't be bashful,\" he said. \"Tell me exactly what you see.\"I had a sudden and strange thought very similar to thoughts that usually come tomy mind just before falling asleep. It was more than a thought. 'A completeimage' would be a better description of it. I saw a tableau containing variouspersonages.The one which was directly in front of me was a man sitting behind a windowframe. The area beyond the frame was diffuse, but the frame and the man werecrystal clear. He was looking at me. Hs head was turned slightly to his left sohe was actually looking askance at me. I could see his eyes moving to keep mewithin focus. He was leaning on the windowsill with his right elbow. His handwas clenched into a fist and his muscles were contracted.To the left of the man there was another image in the tableau. It was a flyinglion. That is, the head and the mane were those of a lion, but the lower part ofits body belonged to a curly white French poodle.I was about to focus my attention on it, when the man made a smacking sound withhis lips and stuck his head and trunk out of the window. His whole body emergedas if something were pushing him. He hung for a moment, grabbing the windowsillwith the tips of his fingers as he swung like a pendulum. Then he let go.I experienced in my own body the sensation of falling. It was not a plummetingdown, but a soft descent, and then a cushioned floating. The man was weightless.He remained stationary for a moment and then he went out of sight as if anuncontrollable force had sipped him away through a crack in the tableau. Aninstant later he was back at the window looking askance at me. His right forearmwas resting on the windowsill, only this time his hand was waving good-by to me.Don Juan's comment was that my 'seeing' was too elaborate.\"You can do better than that,\" he said. \"You want me to explain what happened.Well I want you to use your seeing to do that. You saw, but you saw crap. Thatkind of information is useless to a warrior. It would take too long to figureout what's what. Seeing must be direct because a warrior can't use his time tounravel what he himself is seeing. Seeing is seeing because it cuts through allthat nonsense.\"I asked him if he thought that my vision had only been a hallucination and notreally 'seeing'. He was convinced it had been 'seeing' because of the intricacyof detail, but that it was inappropriate for the occasion.\"Do you think that my visions explain anything?\" I asked.\"Sure they do. But I wouldn't try to unravel them if I were you. In thebeginning seeing is confusing and it's easy to get lost in it. As the warriorgets tighter, however, his seeing becomes what it should be; a direct knowing.\"As don Juan spoke I had one of those peculiar lapses of feelings and I clearlysensed that I was about to unveil something which I already knew, a thing whicheluded me by turning into something very blurry. I became aware that I wasinvolved in a struggle. The more I tried to define or reach that elusive pieceof knowledge, the deeper it sank.\"That seeing was too... too visionary,\" don Juan said.The sound of his voice shook me.\"A warrior asks a question and through his seeing he gets an answer, but theanswer is simple; never embellished to the point of flying French poodles.\"We laughed at the image. And half jokingly I told him that he was too strict;that anyone going through what I had gone through that morning deserved a bit ofleniency.\"That is the easy way out,\" he said. \"That is the indulging way. You hinge theworld on the feeling that everything is too much for you. You're not living likea warrior.\"I told him that there were so many facets of what he called a warrior's way thatit was impossible to fulfill all of them; and that the meaning of it becameclear only as I encountered new instances where I had to apply it.\"A rule of thumb for a warrior,\" he said, \"is that he makes his decisions socarefully that nothing that may happen as a result of them can surprise him;much less drain his power.\"To be a warrior means to be humble and alert. Today you were supposed to watchthe scene which was unfolding in front of your eyes; not to ponder how all thatwas possible. You focused your attention on the wrong place. If I wanted to belenient with you, I could easily say that since this was the first time it hadhappened to you, you were not prepared. But that's not permissible because youcame here as a warrior ready to die. Therefore what happened to you todayshouldn't have caught you with your pants down.\"I conceded that my tendency was to indulge in fear and bewilderment.\"Let's say that a rule of thumb for you should be that when you come to see meyou should come prepared to die,\" he said. \"If you come here ready to die, thereshouldn't be any pitfalls; or any unwelcome surprises; or any unnecessary acts.Everything should gently fall into place because you're expecting nothing.\"\"That's easy to say, don Juan. I am on the receiving end though. I am the onewho has to live with all this.\"\"It is not that you have to live with all this. You are all this. You're notjust tolerating it for the time being. Your decision to join forces with thisevil world of sorcery should have burned all the lingering feelings ofconfusion, and should give you the spunk to claim all this as your world.\"I felt embarrassed and sad. Don Juan's actions, no matter how prepared I was,taxed me in such a way that every time I came in contact with him I was leftwith no other recourse but to act and feel like a half-rational nagging person.I had a surge of wrath and did not want to write any more. At that moment Iwanted to rip my notes and throw everything in the trash can; and I would havedone that had it not been for don Juan who laughed and held my arm; restrainingme.In a mocking tone he said that my 'tonal' was about to fool itself again. Herecommended that I should go to the fountain and splash water on my neck andears.The water soothed me. We were quiet for a long time.\"Write, write,\" don Juan coaxed me in a friendly tone. \"Let's say that yournotebook is the only sorcery you have. To rip it up is another way of openingyourself to your death. It will be another of your tantrums; a flashy tantrum atbest; not a change. A warrior doesn't ever leave the island of the tonal. Heuses it.\"He pointed all around me with a quick movement of his hand and then touched mynotebook.\"This is your world. You can't renounce it. It is useless to get angry and feeldisappointed with oneself. All that that proves is that one's tonal is involvedin an internal battle. A battle within one's tonal is one of the most inanecontests I can think of. The tight life of a warrior is designed to end thatstruggle. From the beginning I have taught you to avoid wear and tear.Now there is no longer a war within you- not as it used to be- because thewarrior's way is harmony; the harmony between actions and decisions at first,and then the harmony between tonal and nagual.\"Throughout the time I have known you I have talked to both your tonal and yournagual. That is the way the instruction should be conducted.\"In the beginning, a teacher has to talk to the tonal. It is the tonal that hasto relinquish control. But it should be made to do so gladly. For example, yourtonal has relinquished some controls without much struggle because it becameclear to it that, had it remained the way it was, the totality of you would bedead by now.In other words, the tonal is made to give up unnecessary things likeself-importance and indulging which only plunge it into boredom. The wholetrouble is that the tonal clings to those things when it should be glad to riditself of that crap.The task then is to convince the tonal to become free and fluid. That's what asorcerer needs before anything else; a strong, free tonal. The stronger it getsthe less it clings to its doings, and the easier it is to shrink it. So whathappened this morning was that I saw the opportunity to shrink your tonal. Foran instant you were absent-minded; hurrying; not thinking; and I grabbed thatmoment to shove you.\"The tonal shrinks at given times, especially when it is embarrassed. In factone of the features of the tonal is its shyness. Its shyness is not really anissue; but there are certain instances when the tonal is taken by surprise, andits shyness unavoidably makes it shrink.\"This morning I plucked my cubic centimeter of chance. I noticed the open doorof that office and gave you a shove. A shove is then the technique for shrinkingthe tonal. One must shove at the precise instant. For that, of course, one mustknow how to see.\"Once the man has been shoved and his tonal has shrunk, his nagual, if it isalready in motion- no matter how small this motion is- will take over andachieve extraordinary deeds. Your nagual took over this morning and you ended upin the market.\"He remained silent for a moment. He seemed to be waiting for questions. Welooked at each other.\"I really don't know how,\" he said as if reading my mind. \"All I know is thatthe nagual is capable of inconceivable feats.\"This morning I asked you to watch. That scene in front of you, whatever it mayhave been, had an incalculable value for you. But instead of following my adviceyou indulged in self-pity and confusion; and did not watch.\"For a while you were all nagual and could not talk. That was the time to watch.Then, little by little, your tonal took over again; and rather than plunging youinto a deadly battle between your tonal and nagual I walked you here.\"\"What was there in that scene, don Juan? What was so important?\"\"I don't know. It wasn't happening to me.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"It was your experience, not mine.\"\"But you were with me. Weren't you?\"\"No. I wasn't. You were alone. I repeatedly told you to watch everything becausethat scene was only for you.\"\"But you were next to me, don Juan.\"\"No. I wasn't. But it's useless to talk about it. Whatever I may say doesn'tmake sense because during those moments we were in nagual's time. The affairs ofthe nagual can be witnessed only with the body; not the reason.\"\"If you were not with me, don Juan, who or what was the person I witnessed asyou?\"\"It was me and yet I wasn't there.\"\"Where were you then?\"\"I was with you, but not there. Let's say that I was around you but not in theparticular place where your nagual had taken you.\"\"You mean you didn't know that we were at the market?\"\"No, I didn't. I just tagged along in order not to lose you.\"\"This is truly awesome, don Juan.\"\"We were in nagual's time, and there is nothing awesome about it. We are capableof much more than that. That is the nature of us as luminous beings. Our flaw isto insist on remaining on our monotonous, tiring, but convenient island. Thetonal is the villain and it shouldn't be.\"I described the little bit I remembered. He wanted to know if I had witnessedany features of the sky, such as daylight, clouds, the sun. Or if I had heardnoises of any sort. Or if I had caught sight of unusual people or events. Hewanted to know if there had been any fights; or if people were yelling, and ifthey were, what they had said.I could not answer any of his questions. The plain truth was that I had acceptedthe event at its apparent face value; admitting as a truism [* truism- anobvious truth] that I had 'flown' over a considerable distance in one or twoseconds; and that thanks to don Juan's knowledge, whatever it may have been, Ihad landed in all my material corporeality [* corporeality- the quality ofconsisting of physical matter] inside the market.My reactions were a direct corollary [* corollary- a practical consequence thatfollows naturally] of such an interpretation. I wanted to know the procedures;the member's knowledge; the 'how to do it'. Therefore I did not care to observewhat I was convinced were the ordinary happenings of a mundane event.\"Do you think that people saw me in the market?\" I asked.Don Juan did not answer. He laughed and tapped me lightly with his fist.I tried to remember if I had actually had any physical contact with people. Mymemory failed me.\"What did the people in the airline office see when I stumbled in?\" I asked.\"They probably saw a man staggering from one door to the other.\"\"But did they see me disappear into thin air?\"\"That is taken care of by the nagual. I don't know how. All I can tell you isthat we are fluid luminous beings made out of fibers. The agreement that we aresolid objects is the tonal's doing. When the tonal shrinks, extraordinary thingsare possible. But they are only extraordinary for the tonal.\"For the nagual, it's nothing to move the way you did this morning. Especiallyfor your nagual which is already capable of difficult ploys. As a matter offact, it has plunged into something terribly weird. Can you feel what it is?\"A million questions and feelings came to me all at once. It was as if a gust ofwind had blown off my veneer [* veneer- a thin ornamental coating] of composure.I shivered. My body felt it was at the edge of an abyss [* abyss- a bottomlesspit]. I struggled with some mysterious but concrete piece of knowledge. It wasas if I were on the verge of being shown something, and yet some stubborn partof me insisted on blowing a cloud over it.The struggle made me numb by degrees, until I could not feel my body. My mouthwas open and my eyes were half closed. I had the feeling I could see my facegetting harder and harder until it was the face of a dried corpse with theyellowish skin stuck tight to the skull.The next thing I felt was a jolt. Don Juan was standing by me holding an emptybucket of water. He had soaked me. I coughed and wiped the water from my face,and felt another cold seizure in my back. I jumped up from the bench. Don Juanhad poured some water down my neck.There was a group of children looking at me and laughing. Don Juan smiled at me.He held my notebook and said that we had better go to my hotel so I could changemy clothes. He led me out of the park. We stood on the curb for a moment beforea cab came along. Hours later, after eating lunch and resting, don Juan and I sat on his favoritebench in the park by the church. In an oblique [* oblique- indirect] manner wegot to the topic of my strange reaction. He seemed to be very cautious. He didnot confront me directly with it.\"Things like that are known to happen,\" he said. \"The nagual, once it learns tosurface, may cause a great damage to the tonal by coming out without anycontrol. Your case is special, though. You are given to indulging in such anexaggerated manner that you would die and not even mind it; or worse yet, noteven be aware that you're dying.\"I told him that my reaction began when he had asked me if I could feel what my'nagual' had done. I thought I knew exactly what he was alluding to, but when Itried to describe what it was, I found I could not think clearly. I experienceda sensation of lightheadedness- almost an indifference- as if I did not reallycare about anything. Then that sensation grew into a mesmerizing concentration.It was as though all of me was slowly being sucked out. What attracted andtrapped my attention was the clear sensation that a portentous secret was aboutto be revealed to me, and I did not want anything to interfere with such arevelation.\"What was going to be revealed to you was your death,\" don Juan said. \"That'sthe danger of indulging, especially for you since you are naturally soexaggerated. Your tonal is so given to indulging that it threatens the totalityof you. This is a terrible way of being.\"\"What can I do?\"\"Your tonal has to be convinced with reasons; your nagual with actions; untilone props the other. As I have told you, the tonal rules, and yet it is veryvulnerable. The nagual, on the other hand, never, or almost never, acts out; butwhen it does, it terrifies the tonal.\"This morning your tonal got frightened and began to shrink by itself, and thenyour nagual began to take over.\"I had to borrow a bucket from one of the photographers in the park in order towhip your nagual like a bad dog back to its place. The tonal must be protectedat any cost. The crown has to be taken away from it, but it must remain as theprotected overseer.\"Any threat to the tonal always results in its death. And if the tonal dies, sodoes the whole man. Because of its inherent weakness, the tonal is easilydestroyed; and thus one of the balancing arts of the warrior is to make thenagual emerge in order to prop up the tonal. I say it is an art becausesorcerers know that only by boosting the tonal can the nagual emerge. See what Imean? That boosting is called personal power.\"Don Juan stood up, stretched his arms and arched his back. I started to stand upmyself, but he gently pushed me down.\"You must stay on this bench until twilight,\" he said. \"I have to leave rightaway. Genaro is waiting for me in the mountains. So come to his house in threedays and we will meet there.\"\"What are we going to do at don Genaro's house?\" I asked.\"Depending on whether you have enough power,\" he said, \"Genaro may show you thenagual.\"There was one more thing that I had to voice at that point. I had to knowwhether his suit was a shocking device for me alone or was it actually part ofhis life. Never had any of his acts caused so much havoc in me as his wearing asuit. It was not only the act in itself that was so awesome to me, but the factthat don Juan was elegant. His legs had a youthful agility. It was as if wearingshoes had shifted his point of balance and his steps were longer and more firmthan usual.\"Do you wear a suit all the time?\" I asked.\"Yes,\" he replied with a charming smile. \"I have others, but I didn't want towear a different suit today because it would've scared you even more.\"I did not know what to think. I felt that I had arrived at the end of my path.If don Juan could wear a suit and be elegant in it, anything was possible.He seemed to enjoy my confusion and laughed.\"I'm a stockholder,\" he said in a mysterious but unaffected tone, and walkedaway.The next morning, on Thursday, I asked a friend of mine to walk with me from thedoor of the office where don Juan had pushed me to the Lagunilla market. We tookthe most direct route. It took us thirty-five minutes. Once we arrived there, Itried to orient myself. I failed. I walked into a clothing store at the verycorner of the wide avenue where we were standing.\"Pardon me,\" I said to a young woman who was gently cleaning a hat with aduster. \"Where are the stands of coins and secondhand books?\"\"We don't have any,\" she said in a nasty tone.\"But I saw them, somewhere in this market, yesterday.\"\"No kidding,\" she said and walked behind the counter.I ran after her and pleaded with her to tell me where they were. She looked meup and down.\"You couldn't have seen them yesterday,\" she said. \"Those stands are assembledonly on Sunday; right here along this wall. We don't have them the rest of theweek.\"\"Only on Sunday?\" I repeated mechanically.\"Yes. Only on Sunday. That's the way. The rest of the week they would interferewith the traffic.\"She pointed to the wide avenue filled with cars. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"In Nagual's Time I ran up a slope in front of don Genaro's house, and saw don Juan and don Genarositting on a cleared area by the door. They smiled at me. There was such warmthand innocence in their smiles that my body experienced a state of immediatealarm. I automatically slowed down to a walk. I greeted them.\"How are you?\" don Genaro asked me in such an affected tone that we all laughed.\"He's in very good shape,\" don Juan interjected before I could answer.\"I can see that,\" don Genaro retorted. \"Look at that double chin! And look atthose chunks of bacon fat on the jowls!\"Don Juan held his stomach as he laughed.\"Your face is round,\" don Genaro went on. \"What have you been doing? Eating?\"Don Juan jokingly assured him that my life style required that I eat a greatdeal. In a most friendly way they teased me about my life, and then don Juanasked me to sit down between them. The sun had already set behind the huge rangeof mountains to the west.\"Where's your famous notebook?\" don Genaro asked me, and when I got it out of mypocket he yelled, \"Yippee!\" and took it from my hands.Obviously he had observed me with great care and knew my mannerisms toperfection. He held the notebook with both hands and played with it nervously,as if he did not know what to do with it.Twice he seemed to be on the verge of throwing it away but appeared to containhimself. Then he held it against his knees and pretended to write feverishly init the way I do.Don Juan laughed so hard that he was about to choke.\"What did you do after I left you?\" don Juan asked after they had quieted down.\"I went to the market on Thursday,\" I said.\"What were you doing there? Retracing your steps?\" he retorted.Don Genaro fell backwards and with his lips made the dry sound of a head hittingthe ground. He looked at me askance [* askance- (used especially of glances)directed to one side with, or as if, with doubt or suspicion or envy] andwinked.\"I had to do it,\" I said. \"And I found out that on weekdays there are no standsthat sell coins and secondhand books.\"Both of them laughed. Then don Juan said that asking questions was not going toreveal anything new.\"What really took place, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Believe me, there is no way of knowing that,\" he said dryly. \"In those mattersyou and I are on equal ground. My advantage over you at this moment is that Iknow how to get to the nagual and you don't. But once I have gotten there I haveno more advantage and no more knowledge than you.\"\"Did I really land in the market, don Juan?\" I asked.\"Of course. I've told you, the nagual is at the warrior's command. Isn't it so,Genaro?\"\"Right!\" don Genaro exclaimed in a booming voice and stood up in one singlemotion. It was as though his voice had pulled him from a lying position to aperfectly vertical one.Don Juan was practically rolling on the ground laughing. Don Genaro, with anonchalant air, took a comical bow and said good-by.\"Genaro will see you tomorrow morning,\" don Juan said. \"Now you must sit here intotal silence.\"We did not say another word. After hours of silence I fell asleep. I looked at my watch. It was almost six in the morning. Don Juan examined thesolid mass of heavy white clouds over the eastern horizon and concluded that itwas going to be an overcast day. Don Genaro sniffed the air and added that itwas also going to be hot and windless.\"How far are we going?\" I asked.\"To those eucalyptus trees over there,\" don Genaro replied, pointing to whatseemed to be a grove of trees about a mile away.When we reached the trees I realized that it was not a grove. The eucalyptus hadbeen planted in straight lines in order to mark the boundaries of fieldscultivated with different crops. We walked along the edge of a corn field alonga line of enormous trees- thin and straight- over a hundred feet high, andarrived at an empty field.I figured that the crop must have just been harvested. There were only the driedstalks and leaves of some plants I did not recognize. I bent over to pick up aleaf but don Genaro stopped me. He held my arm with great force. I recoiled inpain, and then I noticed that he had only placed his fingers gently on my arm.He was definitely aware of what he had done and of what I was experiencing. Heswiftly lifted his fingers off my arm and then again placed them gently on it.He repeated it once more and laughed like a delighted child when I winced. Thenhe turned his profile to me. His aquiline nose made him look like a bird; a birdwith strange long white teeth.In a soft voice don Juan told me not to touch anything. I asked him if he knewwhat kind of crop had been cultivated there. He seemed to be about to tell me,but don Genaro interceded and said that it was a field of worms.Don Juan looked at me fixedly, without cracking a smile. Don Genaro'smeaningless answer appeared to be a joke. I waited for a cue to start laughing,but they just stared at me.\"A field of gorgeous worms,\" don Genaro said. \"Yes, what was grown here was themost delightful worms you've ever seen.\"He turned to don Juan. They looked at each other for an instant.\"Isn't it so?\" don Genaro asked don Juan.\"Absolutely true,\" don Juan said, and turning to me he added in a soft voice,\"Genaro holds the baton today. Only he can tell what's what, so do exactly as hesays.\"The idea that don Genaro had the control filled me with terror. I turned to donJuan to tell him about it, but before I had time to voice my words don Genarolet out a long formidable scream; a yell so loud and frightening that I felt theback of my neck swell and my hair flowing out as if a wind were blowing it.I had an instant of complete disassociation and would have remained glued to thespot had it not been for don Juan, who, with incredible speed and control,turned my body around so my eyes could witness an inconceivable feat.Don Genaro was standing horizontally, about one hundred feet above the ground onthe trunk of a eucalyptus tree which was perhaps fifty yards away. That is hewas standing with his legs three feet apart perpendicular to the tree. It was asif he had hooks on his shoes, and with them was capable of defying gravity. Hisarms were crossed over his chest and his back was turned to me.I stared at him. I did not want to blink for fear of losing sight of him. I madea quick judgment and concluded that if I could maintain him within my field ofvision I might detect a clue, a movement, a gesture, or anything that would helpme understand what was taking place.I felt don Juan's head next to my right ear, and I heard him whisper that anyattempt to explain was useless and idiotic. I heard him repeat, \"Push your bellydown; down.\"It was a technique he had taught me years before to use in moments of greatdanger, fear, or stress. It consisted of pushing the diaphragm down while takingfour sharp gasps of air through the mouth followed by four deep inhalations andexhalations through the nose.He had explained that the gasps of air had to be felt as jolts in the middlepart of the body, and that keeping the hands tightly clasped covering the navelgave strength to the midsection, and helped to control the gasps and the deepinhalations; which had to be held for a count of eight as one pressed thediaphragm down. The exhalations were done twice through the nose and twicethrough the mouth in a slow or accelerated fashion depending on one'spreference.I automatically obeyed don Juan. I did not dare, however, to take my eyes awayfrom don Genaro. As I kept on breathing, my body relaxed and I was aware thatdon Juan was twisting my legs. Apparently when he had turned me around, my rightfoot had caught in a clump of dirt and my leg was uncomfortably bent. When hestraightened me out, I realized that the shock of seeing don Genaro standing onthe trunk of a tree had made me oblivious to my discomfort.Don Juan whispered in my ear that I should not stare at don Genaro. I heard himsay, \"Blink. Blink.\"For a moment I felt reluctant. Don Juan commanded me again. I was convinced thatthe whole affair was somehow linked to me as the onlooker, and, if I as the solewitness of don Genaro's deed had stopped looking at him, he would have fallen tothe ground; or perhaps the whole scene would have vanished.After an excruciatingly long period of immobility, don Genaro swiveled on hisheels, forty-five degrees to his right, and began to walk up the trunk. His bodyshivered. I saw him take one small step after another until he had taken eight.He even circumvented a branch. Then, with his arms still crossed over his chest,he sat down on the trunk with his back to me. His legs dangled as if he weresitting on a chair, as if gravity had no effect on him.He then sort of walked on his seat, downwards. He reached a branch that wasparallel to his body and leaned on it with his left arm and his head for a fewseconds. He seemed to be leaning more for dramatic effect than for support. Hethen kept on moving on his seat inching his way from the trunk onto the branchuntil he had changed his position and was sitting as one might normally sit on abranch.Don Juan giggled. I had a horrible taste in my mouth. I wanted to turn round andface don Juan who was slightly behind me to my right, but I did not dare missany of don Genaro's actions.He dangled his feet for a while, then crossed them and swung them gently, andfinally he slipped upwards back onto the trunk.Don Juan took my head gently in both hands and twisted my neck to the left untilmy line of vision was parallel to the tree rather than perpendicular to it.Looking at don Genaro from that angle he did not appear to be defying gravity.He was simply sitting on the trunk of a tree. I noticed then that if I staredand did not blink, the background became vague and diffuse, and the clarity ofdon Genaro's body became more intense. His shape became dominant as if nothingelse existed.Don Genaro swiftly slid downward back onto the branch. He sat dangling his feetlike on a trapeze. Looking at him from a twisted perspective made bothpositions, especially sitting on the tree trunk, seem feasible.Don Juan shifted my head to the right until it was resting on my shoulder. DonGenaro's position on the branch seemed perfectly normal, but when he moved ontothe trunk again I could not make the necessary perceptual adjustment and I sawhim as if he were upside down with his head towards the ground.Don Genaro moved back and forth various times, and don Juan shifted my head fromside to side every time don Genaro moved. The result of their manipulations wasthat I completely lost track of my normal perspective, and without it donGenaro's actions were not as awesome.Don Genaro remained on the branch for a long time. Don Juan straightened my neckand whispered that don Genaro was about to descend. I heard him whisper in animperative tone, \"Press down. Down.\"I was in the middle of a fast exhalation when don Genaro's body seemed to betransfixed by some sort of tension. It glowed, became lax, swung backwards, andhung by the knees for a moment. His legs seemed to be so flaccid [* flaccid-lacking in strength] that they could not stay bent, and he fell to the ground.At the moment he began his downward fall, I also had the sensation of fallingthrough endless space. My whole body experienced a painful and at the same timeextremely pleasurable anguish; an anguish of such intensity and duration that mylegs could no longer support the weight of my body and I fell down on the softdirt. I could barely move my arms to buffer my fall. I was breathing so heavilythat the soft dirt got into my nostrils and made them itch. I tried to get up.My muscles seemed to have lost their strength.Don Juan and don Genaro came and stood over me. I heard their voices as if theywere quite a distance from me, and yet I felt them pulling me. They must havelifted me up, each holding one of my arms and one of my legs, and carried meover a short distance. I was perfectly aware of the uncomfortable position of myneck and head which hung limp. My eyes were open. I could see the ground andtufts of weeds passing under me.Finally I had a cold seizure. Water entered into my mouth and nose and made mecough. My arms and legs moved frantically. I began to swim but the water was notdeep enough and I found myself standing up in the shallow river where they haddumped me.Don Juan and don Genaro laughed themselves silly. Don Juan rolled up his pantsand came over closer to me. He looked me in the eye and said that I was notcomplete yet and pushed me gently back into the water. My body did not offer anyresistance. I did not want to be dunked again, but there was no way ofconnecting my volition to my muscles and I crumbled backwards. The coldness waseven more intense. I quickly jumped up and scurried out on the opposite bank bymistake.Don Juan and don Genaro yelled and whistled, and threw rocks into the bushesahead of me as though they were corralling a steer that was running astray. Icrossed back over the river and sat on a rock next to them. Don Genaro handed memy clothes, and then I noticed that I was naked although I could not rememberwhen or how I got my clothes off. I was dripping wet and did not want to putthem on right away. Don Juan turned to don Genaro and in a booming tone said,\"For heaven's sake, give the man a towel!\" It took me a couple of seconds torealize the absurdity.I felt very good. In fact I was so happy that I did not want to talk. I had thecertainty, however, that if I showed my euphoria they would have dumped me intothe water again.Don Genaro watched me. His eyes had the glint of a wild animal's. They piercedthrough me.\"Good for you,\" don Juan said to me all of a sudden. \"You're contained now, butdown by the eucalyptus trees you indulged like a son of a bitch.\"I wanted to laugh hysterically. Don Juan's words seemed so utterly funny that Ihad to make a supreme effort to contain myself. And then some part of me flasheda command. An uncontrollable itching in the midsection of my body made me takeoff my clothes and plunge back into the water. I stayed in the river for aboutfive minutes. The coldness restored my sense of sobriety. When I got out I wasmyself again.\"Good show,\" don Juan said, tapping me on the shoulder.They led me back to the eucalyptus trees. As we walked don Juan explained thatmy 'tonal' had been dangerously vulnerable, and that the incongruity of donGenaro's acts seemed to be too much for it. He said that they had decided not totamper with it any more and go back to don Genaro's house, but the fact that Iknew I had to plunge myself into the river again had changed everything. He didnot say, however, what they intended to do.We stood in the middle of the field, on the same spot we had been before. DonJuan was to my right and don Genaro to my left. They both stood with theirmuscles tensed, in a state of alertness. They maintained that tenseness forabout ten minutes. I shifted my eyes from one to the other. I thought that donJuan would cue me on what to do.I was right. At one moment he relaxed his body and kicked some hard clumps ofdirt. Without looking at me, he said, \"I think we'd better go.\" I automaticallyreasoned that don Genaro must have had the intention of giving me anotherdemonstration of the 'nagual', but had decided not to. I felt relieved. I waitedanother moment for a final confirmation. Don Genaro also eased off and then bothof them took one step forward. I knew then that we were through there. But atthe very instant I loosened up, don Genaro again let out his incredible yell.I began to breathe frantically. I looked around. Don Genaro had disappeared. DonJuan was standing in front of me. His body convulsed with laughter. He turned tome.\"I'm sorry,\" he said in a whisper. \"There's no other way.\"I wanted to ask about don Genaro, but I felt that if I did not keep on breathingand pressing down on my diaphragm I would die. Don Juan pointed with his chin toa place behind me. Without moving my feet I began to turn my head over my leftshoulder. But before I could see what he was pointing at, don Juan jumped andstopped me. The force of his leap and the speed with which he grabbed me made melose my balance.As I fell on my back I had the sensation that my startled reaction had been tograb on to don Juan and consequently I dragged him with me to the ground. Butwhen I looked up, the impressions of my tactile and visual senses were in totaldisaccord. I saw don Juan standing over me laughing while my body felt theunmistakable weight and pressure of another body on top of me; almost pinning medown.Don Juan extended his hand and helped me get up. My bodily sensation was that hewas lifting two bodies. He smiled knowingly and whispered that one should neverturn to one's left when facing the 'nagual'. He said that the 'nagual' wasdeadly, and there was no need to make the risks more dangerous than they alreadywere.He then gently turned me around and made me face an enormous eucalyptus tree. Itwas perhaps the oldest tree around. Its trunk was nearly twice as thick as anyof the others. He pointed with his eyes to the top. Don Genaro was perched on abranch. He was facing me. I could see his eyes like two huge mirrors reflectinglight. I did not want to look but don Juan insisted that I should not move myeyes away. In a very forceful whisper he ordered me to blink, and not to succumbto fright or indulgence.I noticed that if I blinked steadily don Genaro's eyes were not so awesome. Itwas only when I stared that the glare of his eyes became maddening.He squatted on the branch for a long time. Then without moving his body at allhe jumped to the ground and landed in the same squatting position a couple ofyards from where I was. I witnessed the complete sequence of his jump, and Iknew that I had perceived more than my eyes had allowed me to catch.Don Genaro had not really jumped. Something had pushed him as if from behind andhad made him glide on a parabolic course. The branch where he had been perchedwas possibly a hundred feet high, and the tree was located about a hundred andfifty feet away from me. Thus his body had to trace a parabola to land where itdid.But the force needed to cover that distance was not the product of don Genaro'smuscles. His body was 'blown' away from the branch to the ground. At one point Iwas able to see the soles of his shoes and his rear as his body described theparabola. Then he landed gently although his weight crumbled the hard clumps ofdried dirt and even raised a bit of dust.Don Juan giggled behind me. Don Genaro stood up as if nothing had happened, andtugged the sleeve of my shirt to give me a signal that we were leaving.No one spoke on the way to don Genaro's house. I felt lucid [* lucid- having aclear mind] and composed. A couple of times don Juan stopped and examined myeyes by staring into them. He seemed satisfied. As soon as we arrived, donGenaro went behind the house. It was still early in the morning. Don Juan sat onthe floor by the door and pointed to a place for me to sit. I was exhausted. Ilay down and went out like a light. I woke up when don Juan shook me. I tried to look at the time. My watch wasmissing. Don Juan pulled it from his shirt pocket and handed it to me. It wasaround 1:00 p.m. I looked up and our eyes met.\"No. There's no explanation,\" he said, turning away from me. \"The nagual is onlyfor witnessing.\"I went around the house looking for don Genaro. He was not there. I came back tothe front. Don Juan had made me something to eat. After I had finished eating hebegan to talk.\"When one is dealing with the nagual, one should never look into it directly,\"he said. \"You were peering at it this morning, and therefore you were sapped.The only way to look at the nagual is as if it were a common affair. One mustblink in order to break the fixation. Our eyes are the eyes of the tonal; orperhaps it would be more accurate to say that our eyes have been trained by thetonal. Therefore the tonal claims them.\"One of the sources of your bafflement and discomfort is that your tonal doesn'tlet go of your eyes. The day it does your nagual will have won a great battle.Your obsession or, better yet, everyone's obsession is to arrange the worldaccording to the tonal's rules. So every time we are confronted with the nagual,we go out of our way to make our eyes stiff and intransigent. [* intransigent-not capable of being affected by pleas, persuasion, requests, or reason] I mustappeal to the part of your tonal which understands this dilemma and you mustmake an effort to free your eyes.The point is to convince the tonal that there are other worlds that can pass infront of the same windows. The nagual showed you that this morning. So let youreyes be free. Let them be true windows. The eyes can be the windows to peer intoboredom or to peek into that infinity.\"Don Juan made a sweeping arc with his left arm to point all around us. There wasa glint in his eyes, and his smile was at once frightening and disarming.\"How can I do that?\" I asked.\"I say that it is a very simple matter. Perhaps I say it is simple because I'vebeen doing it for so long. All you have to do is to set up your intent as acustoms house. Whenever you are in the world of the tonal, you should be animpeccable tonal; no time for irrational crap. But whenever you are in the worldof the nagual, you should also be impeccable; no time for rational crap. For thewarrior, intent is the gate in between. It closes completely behind him when hegoes either way.\"Another thing one should do when facing the nagual is to shift the line of theeyes from time to time in order to break the spell of the nagual. Changing theposition of the eyes always eases the burden of the tonal. This morning Inoticed that you were extremely vulnerable and I changed the position of yourhead.\"If you are in a pinch like that you should be able to shift by yourself. Thisshifting should be done only as a relief, though, not as another way ofpalisading [* palisading- surround with a wall in order to fortify] yourself tosafeguard the order of the tonal. My bet would be that you would strive to usethis technique to hide the rationality of your tonal behind it, and thus believethat you're saving it from extinction. The flaw of your reasoning is that nobodywants or seeks the extinction of the tonal's rationality. That fear is illfounded.\"There is nothing else I can tell you except that you must follow every movementthat Genaro makes without draining yourself. You are testing now whether or notyour tonal is crammed with nonessentials. If there are too many unnecessaryitems on your island, you won't be able to sustain the encounter with the'nagual'.\"\"What would happen to me?\"\"You may die. No one is capable of surviving a deliberate encounter with thenagual without a long training. It takes years to prepare the tonal for such anencounter. Ordinarily if an average man comes face to face with the nagual, theshock would be so great that he would die.\"The goal of a warrior's training then is not to teach him to hex or to charm,but to prepare his tonal not to crap out. A most difficult accomplishment. Awarrior must be taught to be impeccable and thoroughly empty before he couldeven conceive witnessing the nagual.\"In your case, for instance, you have to stop calculating. What you were doingthis morning was absurd. You call it explaining. I call it a sterile and boringinsistence of the tonal to have everything under its control. Whenever itdoesn't succeed, there is a moment of bafflement and then the tonal opens itselfto death. What a prick! It would rather kill itself than relinquish control. Andyet there is very little we can do to change that condition.\"\"How did you change it yourself, don Juan?\"\"The island of the tonal has to be swept clean and maintained clean. That's theonly alternative that a warrior has. A clean island offers no resistance. It isas if there were nothing there.\"He went around the house and sat down on a big smooth rock. From there one couldlook into a deep ravine. He signaled me to sit down next to him.\"Can you tell me, don Juan, what else we are going to do today?\" I asked.\"We aren't going to do anything. That is, you and I will only be the witnesses.Your benefactor is Genaro.\"I thought I had misunderstood him in my eagerness to take notes. At thebeginning stages of my apprenticeship, don Juan himself had introduced the term'benefactor'. My impression had always been that he himself was my benefactor.Don Juan had stopped talking and was staring at me. I made a quick assessmentand my conclusion was that he must have meant that don Genaro was something likethe star performer on that occasion. Don Juan giggled as if he were reading mythoughts.\"Genaro is your benefactor,\" he repeated.\"But you are, aren't you?\" I asked in a frantic tone.\"I'm the one who helped you sweep the island of the tonal,\" he said. \"Genaro hastwo apprentices, Pablito and Nestor. He is helping them sweep the island, but Iwill show them the nagual. I will be their benefactor. Genaro is only theirteacher. In these matters one can either talk or act. One cannot do both withthe same person. One either takes the island of the tonal or one takes thenagual. In your case my duty has been to work with your tonal.\"As don Juan spoke I had an attack of terror so intense that I was about to getill. I had the feeling that he was going to leave me with don Genaro and thatwas a most dreadful scheme to me.Don Juan laughed and laughed as I voiced my fears.\"The same thing happens to Pablito,\" he said. \"The moment he sets eyes on me hegets ill. The other day he walked into the house when Genaro was gone. I wasalone there and I had left my sombrero by the door. Pablito saw it and his tonalbecame so frightened that he actually shit in his pants.\"I could easily understand and project into Pablito's feelings. When I consideredthe matter carefully, I had to admit that don Juan was terrifying. I hadlearned, however, to feel comfortable with him. I experienced with him afamiliarity born out of our long association.\"I'm not going to leave you with Genaro,\" he said, still laughing. \"I'm the onewho takes care of your tonal. Without it you're dead.\"\"Has every apprentice a teacher and a benefactor?\" I asked to ease my turmoil.\"No, not every apprentice. But some do.\"\"Why do some of them have both a teacher and a benefactor?\"\"When an ordinary man is ready, power provides him with a teacher and he becomesan apprentice. When the apprentice is ready, power provides him with abenefactor and he becomes a sorcerer.\"\"What makes a man ready, so that power can provide him with a teacher?\"\"No one knows that. We are only men. Some of us are men who have learned to seeand use the nagual, but nothing that we may have gained in the course of ourlives can reveal to us the designs of power. Thus not every apprentice has abenefactor. Power decides that.\"I asked him if he himself had had a teacher and a benefactor, and for the firsttime in thirteen years he freely talked about them. He said that both histeacher and his benefactor were from central Mexico. I had always consideredthat information about don Juan to be of value for my anthropological research,but somehow at the moment of his revelation it did not matter.Don Juan glanced at me. I though it was a look of concern. He then abruptlychanged the subject and asked me to recount every detail of what I hadexperienced in the morning.\"A sudden fright always shrinks the tonal\" he said as a comment on mydescription of how I felt when don Genaro screamed. \"The problem here is not tolet the tonal shrink itself out of the picture. A grave issue for a warrior isto know exactly when to allow his tonal to shrink and when to stop it. This is agreat art. A warrior must struggle like a demon to shrink his tonal; and yet atthe very moment the tonal shrinks, the warrior must reverse all that struggle toimmediately halt that shrinking.\"\"But by doing that isn't he reverting back to what he already was?\" I asked.\"No. After the tonal shrinks, the warrior is closing the gate from the otherside. As long as his tonal is unchallenged and his eyes are tuned only for thetonal's world, the warrior is on the safe side of the fence. He's on familiarground and knows all the rules.But when his tonal shrinks he is on the windy side, and that opening must beshut tight immediately; or he would be swept away. And this is not just a way oftalking. Beyond the gate of the tonal's eyes the wind rages. I mean a real wind.No metaphor. A wind that can blow one's life away. In fact, that is the windthat blows all living things on this earth. Years ago I acquainted you with thatwind. You took it as a joke though.\"He was referring to a time when he had taken me to the mountains and explainedcertain properties of the wind. I had never thought it was a joke however.\"It's not important whether you took it seriously or not,\" he said afterlistening to my protests. \"As a rule the tonal must defend itself at any costevery time it is threatened. So it is of no real consequence how the tonalreacts in order to accomplish its defense. The only important matter is that thetonal of a warrior must become acquainted with other alternatives.\"What a teacher aims for, in this case, is the total weight of thosepossibilities. It is the weight of those new possibilities which helps to shrinkthe tonal. By the same token, it is the same weight which helps stop the tonalfrom shrinking out of the picture.\"He signaled me to proceed with my narrative of the events of the morning, and heinterrupted me when I came to the part where don Genaro slid back and forth fromthe tree trunk to the branch.\"The nagual can perform extraordinary things;\" he said. \"things that do not seempossible; things that are unthinkable for the tonal. But the extraordinary thingis that the performer has no way of knowing how those things happen. In otherwords, Genaro doesn't know how he does those things. He only knows that he doesthem. The secret of a sorcerer is that he knows how to get to the nagual, butonce he gets there, your guess is as good as his as to what takes place.\"\"But what does one feel while doing those things?\"\"One feels like one is doing something.\"\"Would don Genaro feel like he's walking up the trunk of a tree?\"Don Juan looked at me for a moment, then he turned his head away.\"No,\" he said in a forceful whisper. \"Not in the way you mean it.\"He did not say anything else. I was practically holding my breath waiting forhis explanation. Finally I had to ask, \"But what does he feel?\"\"I can't say, not because it is a personal matter, but because there is no wayof describing it.\"\"Come on,\" I coaxed him. \"There is nothing that one can't explain or elucidatewith words. I believe that even if it's not possible to describe somethingdirectly one can allude to it; beat around the bush.\"Don Juan laughed. His laughter was friendly and kind. And yet there was a touchof mockery and sheer mischievoiisness in it.\"I have to change the subject,\" he said. \"Suffice it to say that the nagual wasaimed at you this morning. Whatever Genaro did was a mixture of you and him. Hisnagual was tempered by your tonal.\"I insisted on probing and asked him, \"When you're showing the nagual to Pablito,what do you feel?\"\"I can't explain that,\" he said in a soft voice. \"And not because I don't wantto, but simply because I can't. My tonal stops there.\"I did not want to press him any further. We remained silent for a while, then hebegan to talk again\"Let's say that a warrior learns to tune his will, to direct it to a pinpoint;to focus it wherever he wants. It is as if his will, which comes from themidsection of his body, is one single luminous fiber; a fiber that he can directat any conceivable place. That fiber is the road to the nagual; or I could alsosay that the warrior sinks into the nagual through that single fiber.\"Once he has sunk, the expression of the nagual is a matter of his personaltemperament. If the warrior is funny, the nagual is funny. If the warrior ismorbid, the nagual is morbid. If the warrior is mean, the nagual is mean.\"Genaro always cracks me up because he's one of the most delightful creaturesalive. I never know what he's going to come up with. That to me is the ultimateessence of sorcery. Genaro is such a fluid warrior that the slightest focusingof his will makes his nagual act in incredible ways.\"\"Did you yourself observe what don Genaro was doing in the trees?\" I asked.\"No. I just knew because I saw that the nagual was in the trees. The rest of theshow was for you alone.\"\"Do you mean, don Juan, that like the time when you pushed me and I ended up inthe market, you were not with me?\"\"It was something like that. When one meets the nagual face to face, one alwayshas to be alone. I was around only to protect your tonal. That is my charge.\" [*charge- a person committed to your care]Don Juan said that my 'tonal' was nearly blasted to pieces when don Genarodescended from the tree; not so much because of any inherent quality of dangerin the 'nagual', but because my 'tonal' indulged in its bewilderment. He saidthat one of the aims of the warrior's training was to cut the bewilderment ofthe 'tonal' until the warrior was so fluid that he could admit everythingwithout admitting anything.When I described don Genaro's leap up to the tree and his leap down from it, donJuan said that the yell of a warrior was one of the most important issues ofsorcery, and that don Genaro was capable of focusing on his yell; using it as avehicle.\"You are right,\" he said. \"Genaro was pulled partly by his yell and partly bythe tree. That was true seeing on your part. That was a true picture of thenagual. Genaro's will was focused on the yell and his personal touch made thetree pull the nagual. The lines went both ways from Genaro to the tree and fromthe tree to Genaro.\"What you should have seen when Genaro jumped from the tree was that he wasfocusing on a spot in front of you and then the tree pushed him. But it onlyseemed to be a push. In essence it was more like being released by the tree. Thetree released the nagual and the nagual came back to the world of the tonal onthe spot he focused on.\"The second time that Genaro came down from the tree your tonal was not sobewildered. You were not indulging so hard and therefore you were not as sappedas you were the first time.\"Around four in the afternoon don Juan stopped our conversation.\"We are going back to the eucalyptus trees,\" he said. \"The nagual is waiting forus there.\"\"Aren't we risking being seen by people?\" I asked.\"No. The nagual will keep everything suspended,\" he said. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Whispering of the Nagual As we approached the eucalyptuses, I saw don Genaro sitting on a tree stump. Hewaved his hand; smiling. We joined him.There was a flock of crows in the trees. They were cawing as if something werefrightening them. Don Genaro said that we had to remain motionless and quietuntil the crows had calmed down.Don Juan leaned his back against a tree and signaled me to do the same on a treenext to him a few feet away to his left. We were both facing don Genaro, who wasthree or four yards in front of us.With a subtle movement of his eyes, don Juan gave me a cue to rearrange my feet.He was standing firmly with his feet slightly apart; touching the tree trunkonly with the upper part of his shoulder blades and with the very back of hishead. His arms hung at his sides.We stood like that for perhaps an hour. I kept a close vigil on both of them,especially on don Juan. At a given moment he slid gently-down the tree trunk andsat down, still keeping the same areas of his body in contact with the tree. Hisknees were raised and he rested his arms on them. I imitated his movements. Mylegs had become extremely tired and the change of position made me feel quitecomfortable.The crows had stopped cawing by degrees until there was not a single sound inthe field. The silence was more unnerving to me than the noise of the crows.Don Juan spoke to me in a quiet tone. He said that the twilight was my besthour. He looked at the sky. It must have been after six.It had been an overcast day and I had had no way of checking the position of thesun. I heard the distant cries of geese and perhaps turkeys. But in the fieldwith eucalyptus trees there was no noise. There had been no whistling of birdsor sounds of large insects for a long time.The bodies of don Juan and don Genaro had been in perfect immobility, as far asI could judge, except for a few seconds when they shifted their weight in orderto rest.After don Juan and I had slid to the ground, don Genaro made a sudden motion. Helifted his feet up and squatted on the stump. He then turned forty-five degrees,and I was looking at his left profile. I stared at don Juan in search of a clue.He jutted his chin,It was a command to look at don Genaro.A monstrous agitation began to overtake me. I was incapable of containingmyself. My bowels were loose. I could absolutely feel what Pablito must havefelt when he saw don Juan's sombrero. I experienced such intestinal distressthat I had to get up and run to the bushes. I heard them howling with laughter.I did not dare to return to where they were. I hesitated for a while. I figuredthat the spell must have been broken by my sudden outburst. I did not have toponder for too long. I don Juan and don Genaro came over to where I was. Theyflanked [* flanked- located at the sides] me and we walked to another field. Westopped at the very center of it, and I recognized that we had been there in themorning.Don Juan spoke to me. He told me that I had to be fluid and silent and shouldstop my internal dialogue. I listened attentively. Don Genaro must have beenaware that all my concentration was focused on don Juan's admonitions, and heused that moment to do what he had done in the morning. He again let out hismaddening scream.He caught me unaware but not unprepared. I almost immediately recuperated mybalance by breathing. The jolt was terrifying, yet it did not have a prolongedeffect on me, and I was capable of following don Genaro's movements with myeyes.I saw him leap to a low branch on a tree. As I followed his course for adistance of eighty to ninety feet, my eyes experienced an extravagantdistortion. It was not that he leaped by means of the spring action of hismuscles. He rather glided through the air catapulted in part by his formidableyell, and pulled by some vague lines emanating from the tree. It was as if thetree had sipped him through its lines.Don Genaro stayed perched on the low branch for a moment. His left profile wasturned to me. He began to perform a series of strange movements. His headwobbled, his body shivered. He hid his head various times in between his knees.The more he moved and fretted the more difficult it was for me to focus my eyeson his body. He seemed to be dissolving.I blinked desperately and then I shifted my line of vision by twisting my headto the right and to the left as don Juan had taught me. From my left perspectiveI saw don Genaro's body as I had never seen it before. It was as if he had puton a disguise. He had a furry suit on. The hair was the color of a Siamese cat;light buff-brown with touches of dark chocolate brown on the legs and the back.It had a long thick tail. Don Genaro's costume made him look like a furry brownlong-legged crocodile sitting on a branch. I could not see his head or hisfeatures.I straightened my head to a normal position. The vision of don Genaro indisguise remained unchanged.Don Genaro's arms shivered. He stood up on the branch, sort of stooped over, andleaped towards the ground. The branch was perhaps fifteen to twenty feet high.As far as I could judge, it was an ordinary leap of a man wearing a costume. Isaw don Genaro's body almost touching the ground and then the thick tail of hiscostume vibrated, and instead of landing he took off as if powered with a silentjet engine. He went over the trees and then glided almost to the ground. He didthat over and over. At times he would hold on to a branch and swing around atree, or curl like an eel between branches. And then he would glide and circlearound us, or flap his arms as he touched the very tops of the trees with hisstomach.Don Genaro's cavorting filled me with awe. My eyes followed him, and two orthree times I clearly perceived that he was using some brilliant lines, as ifthey were pulleys, to glide from one place to another. Then he went over thetops of the trees towards the south and disappeared behind them. I tried toanticipate the place where he would appear again, but he did not show up at all.I noticed then that I was lying on my back, and yet I had not been aware of achange in perspective. I had thought all along that I was looking at don Genarofrom a standing position.Don Juan helped me to sit up and then I saw don Genaro walking towards us with anonchalant air. He smiled coyly and asked me if I had liked his flying. Iattempted to say something but I was speechless.Don Genaro exchanged a strange look with don Juan and adopted a squat positionagain. He leaned over and whispered something in my left ear. I heard him say,\"Why don't you come and fly with me?\" He repeated it five or six times.Don Juan came towards me and whispered in my right ear, \"Don't talk. Just followGenaro.\"Don Genaro made me squat and whispered to me again. I heard him with crystalclear precision. He repeated the statement perhaps ten times. He said, \"Trustthe nagual. The nagual will take you.\"Then don Juan whispered in my right ear another statement. He said, \"Change yourfeelings.\"I could hear both of them talking to me at once, but I could also hear themindividually. Every one of don Genaro's statements had to do with the generalcontext of gliding through the air. The statements that he repeated dozens oftimes seemed to be those that became engraved in my memory. Don Juan's words, onthe other hand, had to do with specific commands, which he repeated countlesstimes.The effect of that dual whispering was most extraordinary. It was as if thesound of their individual words were splitting me in half. Finally the abyssbetween my two ears was so wide that I lost all sense of unity. There wassomething that was undoubtedly me, but it was not solid. It was rather like aglowing fog; a dark yellow mist that had feelings.Don Juan told me that he was going to mold me for flying. The sensation I hadthen was that the words were like pliers that twisted and molded my 'feelings'.Don Genaro's words were an invitation to follow him. I felt I wanted to, but Icould not. The split was so great that I was incapacitated. [* incapacitated-lacking in, or deprived of, strength or power] Then I heard the same shortstatements repeated endlessly by both of them; things like \"Look at thatmagnificent flying shape.\" \"Leap, leap.\" \"Your legs will reach the treetops.\"\"The eucalyptuses are like green dots.\" \"The worms are lights.\"Something in me must have ceased at a given moment; perhaps my awareness ofbeing talked to. I sensed that don Genaro was still with me, yet from the pointof view of my perception I could only distinguish an enormous mass of the mostextraordinary lights. At times their glare diminished and at times the lightsbecame intense. I was also experiencing movement. The effect was like beingpulled by a vacuum that never let me stop. Whenever my motion seemed to diminishand I could actually focus my awareness on the lights, the vacuum would pull meaway again.At one moment, between being pulled back and forth, I experienced the ultimateconfusion. The world around me, whatever it was, was coming and going at thesame time; thus the vacuumlike effect. I could see two separate worlds; one thatwas going away from me, and the other that was coming closer to me. I did notrealize this as one ordinarily would. That is, I did not become aware of it assomething that had thus far been unrevealed. I rather had two realizationswithout the unifying conclusion.After that my perceptions became dull. They either lacked precision, or theywere too many and I had no way of sorting them. The next batch of discernibleapperceptions [* apperceptions- processes whereby perceived qualities of anobject are related to past experience] were a series of sounds that happened atthe end of a long tubelike formation. The tube was myself, and the sounds weredon Juan and don Genaro again talking to me through each of my ears.The more they talked the shorter the tube became until the sounds were in arange I recognized. That is to say, the sounds of don Juan and don Genaro'swords reached my normal range of perception. The sounds were first recognizableas noises, then as words yelled, and finally as words whispered in my ears.I next noticed things of the familiar world. I was apparently lying face down. Icould distinguish: clumps of dirt, small rocks, dried leaves; and then I becameaware of the field of eucalyptus trees.Don Juan and don Genaro were standing by me. It was still light. I felt that Ihad to get into the water in order to consolidate myself. I walked to the river,took off my clothes, and stayed in the cold water long enough to restore myperceptual balance. Don Genaro left as soon as we arrived at his house. He casually patted me on theshoulder as he was leaving. I jumped away in a reflex reaction. I thought thathis touch was going to be painful. To my amazement it was simply a gentle pat onthe shoulder.Don Juan and don Genaro laughed like two kids celebrating a prank.\"Don't be so jumpy,\" don Genaro said. \"The nagual is not after you all thetime.\"He smacked his lips as though disapproving my overreaction, and with an air ofcandor and comradeship he extended his arms. I embraced him. He patted my backin a most friendly warm gesture.\"You must be concerned with the nagual only at certain moments,\" he said. \"Therest of the time you and I are like all the other people on this earth.\"He faced don Juan and smiled at him.\"Isn't it so, Juancho?\" he asked, emphasizing the word Juancho; a funny nicknamefor Juan.\"That's so, Gerancho,\" don Juan answered, making up the word Gerancho.They both had an explosion of laughter.\"I must warn you,\" don Juan said to me, \"you have to exert the most demandingvigil to be sure when a man is a nagual and when a man is simply a man. You maydie if you come into direct physical contact with the nagual\"Don Juan turned to don Genaro and with a beaming smile asked, \"Isn't it so,Gerancho?\"\"That's so, absolutely so, Juancho,\" don Genaro replied, and both of themlaughed.Their childlike mirth was very moving to me. The events of the day had beenexhausting and I was very emotional. A wave of self-pity engulfed me. I wasabout to weep as I kept on repeating to myself that whatever they had done to mewas irreversible and most likely injurious. Don Juan seemed to be reading mythoughts and shook his head in a gesture of disbelief. He chuckled. I made aneffort to stop my internal dialogue, and my self-pity vanished.\"Genaro is very warm,\" don Juan commented when don Genaro had left. \"The designof power was that you found a gentle benefactor.\"I did not know what to say. The idea that don Genaro was my benefactor intriguedme no end. I wanted don Juan to tell me more about it. He did not seem inclinedto talk. He looked at the sky and at the top of the dark silhouette of sometrees at the side of the house. He sat down with his back against a thick forkedpole planted almost in front of the door, and told me to sit next to him to hisleft.I sat by him. He pulled me closer by the arm until I was touching him. He saidthat that time of the night was dangerous for me; especially on that occasion.In a very calm voice he gave me a set of instructions: We were not to move fromthe spot until he saw fit to do so; we were to keep on talking on an even keelwithout long interruptions; and I had to breathe and blink as if I were facingthe 'nagual'.\"Is the nagual around here?\" I asked.\"Of course,\" he said and chuckled.I practically huddled against don Juan. He began to talk and actually solicitedany kind of question from me. He even handed me my notebook and pencil as if Icould write in the darkness. His contention was that I needed to be as calm andnormal as possible, and there could be no better way of fortifying my 'tonal'than through taking notes. He put the whole matter on a very compelling level.He said that if taking notes was my predilection, then I should be able to do itin complete darkness. There was a tone of challenge in his voice when he saidthat I could turn the taking of notes into a warrior's task in which case thedarkness would be no obstacle.Somehow, he must have convinced me for I managed to scribble down parts of ourconversation. The main topic was don Genaro as my benefactor. I was curious toknow when don Genaro had become my benefactor and don Juan coaxed me to remembera supposedly extraordinary event that had happened the day I had met don Genaro,and which served as a proper omen. I could not recollect anything of the sort. Ibegan to recount the experience, As far as I could remember, it was a mostunobtrusive and casual meeting which took place in the spring of 1968. Don Juanstopped me.\"If you're dumb enough not to remember,\" he said, \"we'd better leave it thatway. A warrior follows the dictums of power. You will remember it when itbecomes necessary.\"Don Juan said that having a benefactor was a most difficult matter. He used asan example the case of his own apprentice Eligio who had been with him for manyyears. He said that Eligio had been unable to find a benefactor. I asked him ifEligio would eventually find one. He answered that there was no way ofpredicting the quirks of power.He reminded me that once, years before, we had found a group of young Indiansroaming around the desert in northern Mexico. He said that he 'saw' that none ofthem had a benefactor, and that the general surroundings and the mood of themoment were just right for him to give them a hand by showing them the 'nagual'.He was talking about one night when four young men sat by a fire while don Juanput on what I thought to be a spectacular show in which he apparently appearedto each of us in a different guise.\"Those guys knew a great deal,\" he said. \"You were the only greenhorn amongthem.\"\"What happened to them afterwards?\" I asked.\"Some of them found a benefactor,\" he replied.Don Juan said that it was the duty of a benefactor to deliver his ward to power,and that the benefactor imparted to the neophyte [* neophyte- a new participantin some activity] his personal touch as much if not more so than the teacher.During a short pause in our talk I heard a strange rasping noise at the hack ofthe house. Don Juan held me down. I had almost stood up as a reaction to it.Before the noise happened, our conversation had been a matter of course for me.But when the pause occurred and there was a moment of silence, the strange noisepopped through it. At that instant I had the certainty that our conversation wasan extraordinary event. I had the sensation that the sound of don Juan's wordsand mine were like a sheet that broke, and that the rasping sound had beendeliberately prowling; waiting for a chance to break through.Don Juan commanded me to sit tight and not to pay attention to the surroundings.The rasping noise reminded me of the sound of a gopher clawing on hard dryground. The moment I had thought of the simile [* simile- a figure of speechthat expresses a resemblance between things of different kinds] I also had avisual image of a rodent like the one don Juan had showed me on his palm. It wasas if I were falling asleep and my thoughts were turning into visions or dreams.I began the breathing exercise, and held my stomach with my clasped hands. DonJuan kept on talking, but I was not listening to him. My attention was on thesoft rustle of a snake-like thing slithering over small dry leaves. I had amoment of panic and physical revulsion at the thought of a snake crawling on me.I involuntarily put my feet under don Juan's legs, and breathed and blinkedfrantically.I heard the noise so close that it seemed to be only a couple of feet away. Mypanic mounted. Don Juan calmly said that the only way to fend off the 'nagual'was to remain unaltered. He ordered me to stretch my legs and not to focus myattention on the noise. He imperatively demanded that I write or ask questions,and make an effort not to succumb.After a great struggle I asked him if don Genaro was making the noise. He saidthat it was the 'nagual' and that I should not mix them. Genaro was the name ofthe 'tonal'. He then said something else, but I could not understand him.Something was circling around the house and I could not concentrate on ourconversation. He commanded me to make a supreme effort. At one moment I foundthat I was babbling idiocies about my being unworthy. I had a jolt of fear andsnapped into a state of great lucidity. Don Juan told me then that it was allright to listen. But there were no sounds.\"The nagual is gone,\" don Juan said and stood up and went inside.He lit don Genaro's kerosene lantern and made some food. We ate in silence. Iasked him if the 'nagual' was coming back.\"No,\" he said with a serious expression. \"It was just testing you. At this timeof night just after the twilight, you should always involve yourself insomething. Anything would do. It is only for a short period- an hour perhaps-but in your case a most deadly hour.\"Tonight the nagual tried to make you stumble, but you were strong enough toward off its assault. On another occasion you succumbed to it and I had to pourwater over your body. This time you did fine.\"I remarked that the word 'assault' made the event sound very dangerous.\"Made it sound dangerous? That's a weird way of putting it,\" he said. \"I'm nottrying to scare you. The actions of the nagual are deadly. I've already told youthat, and it is not that Genaro tries to hurt you;. On the contrary, his concernfor you is impeccable. But if you don't have enough power to parry the nagual'sonslaught, you're dead regardless of my help or Genaro's concern.\"After we finished eating, don Juan sat next to me and looked over my shoulder atmy notes. I commented that it would probably take me years to assort [* assort-arrange or order by classes or categories] everything that had happened to meduring that day. I knew that I had been flooded with perceptions I could notever hope to understand.\"If you cannot understand, you're in great shape,\" he said. \"It is when youthink you understand that you're in a mess. That's from the point of view of asorcerer, of course. From the point of view of an average man, if you fail tounderstand you're sinking. In your case I would say that an average man wouldthink that you are disassociated or you're beginning to become disassociated.\"I laughed at his choice of words. I knew that he was throwing the concept ofdisassociation back at me. I had mentioned it to him sometime back in connectionwith my fears. I assured him that this time I was not going to ask anythingabout what I had been through.\"I've never put a ban on talking,\" he said. \"We can talk about the nagual toyour heart's content as long as you don't try to explain it. If you remembercorrectly, I said that the nagual is only for witnessing. So, we can talk aboutwhat we witnessed and about how we witnessed it.\"You want to take on the explanation of how it is all possible, though, and thatis an abomination. [* abomination- an action that arouses disgust] You want toexplain the nagual with the tonal. That is stupid especially in your case sinceyou can no longer hide behind your ignorance. You know very well that we makesense in talking only because we stay within certain boundaries, and thoseboundaries are not applicable to the nagual\"I attempted to clarify the issue. It was not only that I wanted to explaineverything from a rational point of view, but my need to explain stemmed from mynecessity to maintain order throughout the tremendous onslaughts of chaoticstimuli and perceptions I had had.Don Juan's comment was that I was trying to defend a point I did not agree with.\"You know damn well that you're indulging.\" he said. \"To maintain order means tobe a perfect tonal, and to be a perfect tonal means to be aware of everythingthat takes place on the island of the tonal. But you're not. So your argumentabout maintaining order has no truth in it. You only use it to win an argument.\"I did not know what to say. Don Juan sort of consoled me by saying that it tooka gigantic struggle to clean the island of the 'tonal'. Then he asked me torecount all I had perceived in my second session with the 'nagual'. When I hadfinished he said that what I had witnessed as a furry crocodile was the epitomeof don Genaro's sense of humor.\"It's a pity that you're still so heavy,\" he said. \"You always get hooked bybewilderment and miss Genaro's real art.\"\"Were you aware of his appearance, don Juan?\"\"No. The show was only for you.\"\"What did you see?\"\"Today all I could see was the movement of the nagual, gliding through the treesand whirling around us. Anyone who sees can witness that.\"\"What about someone who doesn't see?\"\"He would witness nothing; just the trees being blown by a wild wind perhaps. Weinterpret any unknown expression of the nagual as something we know. In thiscase the nagual might be interpreted as a breeze shaking the leaves, or even assome strange light; perhaps a lightning bug of unusual size.If a man who doesn't see is pressed, he would say that he thought he sawsomething but could not remember what. This is only natural. The man would betalking sense. After all, his eyes would have judged nothing extraordinary.Being the eyes of the tonal they have to be limited to the tonal's world, and inthat world there is nothing staggeringly new; nothing which the eyes cannotapprehend and the tonal cannot explain.\"I asked him about the uncharted perceptions that resulted from their whisperingin my ears.\"That was the best part of the whole event,\" he said. \"The rest could bedispensed with, but that was the crown of the day. The rule calls for thebenefactor and the teacher to make that final trimming; the most difficult ofall acts. Both the teacher and the benefactor must be impeccable warriors toeven attempt the feat of splitting a man. You don't know this because it stillis beyond your realm, but power had been lenient with you again. Genaro is themost impeccable warrior there is.\"\"Why is the splitting of a man a great feat?\"\"Because it is dangerous. You may have died like a little bug. Or worse yet, wemay have never been able to put you back together and you would have remained onthat plateau of feeling.\"\"Why was it necessary to do it to me, don Juan?\"\"There is a certain time when the nagual has to whisper in the ear of theapprentice and split him,\"\"What does that mean, don Juan?\"\"In order to be an average tonal a man must have unity. His whole being mustbelong to the island of the tonal. Without that unity the man would go berserk.A sorcerer, however, has to break that unity, but without endangering his being.A sorcerer's goal is to last. That is, he doesn't take unnecessary risks.Therefore he spends years sweeping his island until a moment when he could, in amanner of speaking, sneak off it. Splitting a man in two is the gate for such anescape.\"The splitting, which is the most dangerous thing you've ever gone through, wassmooth and simple. The nagual was masterful in guiding you. Believe me, only animpeccable warrior can do that. I felt very good for you.\"Don Juan put his hand on my shoulder and I had a gigantic urge to weep.\"Am I arriving at a point when you won't see me any more?\" I asked.He laughed and shook his head.\"You indulge like a son of a bitch,\" he said. \"We all do that though. We havedifferent ways: that's all. Sometimes I indulge too. My way is to feel that Ihave pampered you and made you weak. I know that Genaro has the same feelingabout Pablito. He pampers him like a child. But that is the way power set it upto be. Genaro gives Pablito everything he's capable of giving and one cannotwish he would do something else. One cannot criticize a warrior for doing hisimpeccable best.\"He was quiet for a moment. I was too nervous to sit in silence.\"What do you think was happening to me when I felt like I was being sucked by avacuum?\" I asked.\"You were gliding,\" he said in a matter-of-fact tone.\"Through the air?\"\"No. For the nagual there is no land, or air, or water. At this point youyourself can agree with that. Twice you were in that limbo and you were only atthe door of the nagual. You've told me that everything you encountered wasuncharted. So the nagual glides, or flies, or does whatever it may do innagual's time, and that has nothing to do with tonal's time. The two thingsdon't jibe.\"As don Juan spoke I felt a tremor in my body. My jaw dropped and my mouth openedinvoluntarily. My ears unplugged, and I could hear a barely perceptible tingleor vibration. While I was describing my sensations to don Juan I noticed thatwhen I talked it sounded as if someone else were talking. It was a complexsensation that amounted to my hearing what I was going to say before I said it.My left ear was a source of extraordinary sensations. I felt that it was morepowerful and more accurate than my right ear. There was something in it that hadnot been there before. When I turned around to face don Juan, who was to myright, I became aware that I had a range of clear auditory perception aroundthat ear. It was a physical space, a range within which I could hear everythingwith incredible fidelity. By turning my head around I could scan thesurroundings with my ear.\"The whispering of the nagual did that to you,\" don Juan said when I describedmy sensorial experience. \"It'll come at times and then vanish. Don't be afraidof it or of any unusual sensation that you may have from now on. But above all,don't indulge and become obsessed with those sensations. I know you willsucceed. The time for your splitting was right. Power fixed all that. Noweverything depends on you. If you are powerful enough you will sustain the greatshock of being split. But if you're incapable of holding on, you will perish.You will begin to wither away; lose weight, become pale, absent-minded,irritable, quiet.\"\"Perhaps if you would have told me years ago,\" I said, \"what you and don Genarowere doing, I would have enough...\"He raised his hand and did not let me finish.\"That's a meaningless statement,\" he said. \"You once told me that if it wouldn'tbe for the fact that you're stubborn and given to rational explanations youwould be a sorcerer by now. But to be a sorcerer in your case means that youhave to overcome stubbornness and the need for rational explanations which standin your way. What's more, those shortcomings are your road to power. You can'tsay that power would flow to you if your life would be different.\"Genaro and I have to act the same way you do; within certain limits. Power setsup those limits and a warrior is, let's say, a prisoner of power; a prisoner whohas one free choice; the choice to act either like an impeccable warrior, or toact like an ass. In the final analysis, perhaps the warrior is not a prisonerbut a slave of power because that choice is no longer a choice for him. Genarocannot act in any other way but impeccably. To act like an ass would drain himand cause his demise.\"The reason why you're afraid of Genaro is because he has to use the avenue offright to shrink your tonal. Your body knows that- although your reason may not-and thus your body wants to run away every time Genaro is around.\"I mentioned that I was curious to know if don Genaro deliberately set out toscare me. He said that the 'nagual' did strange things; things which were notforeseeable. He gave me, as an example, what had happened between us in themorning when he prevented my turning to my left to look at don Genaro in thetree. He said that he was aware of what his 'nagual' had done although he had noway of knowing about it ahead of time. His explanation of the whole affair wasthat my sudden movement to the left was a step towards my death, which my'tonal' was deliberately taking as a suicidal plunge. That movement stirred his'nagual' and the result was that some part of him fell on top of me.I made an involuntary gesture of perplexity.\"Your reason is telling you again that you're immortal,\" he said.\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\"\"An immortal being has all the time in the world for doubts and bewilderment andfears. A warrior, on the other hand, cannot cling to the meanings made under thetonal's order because he knows for a fact that the totality of himself has but alittle time on this earth.\"I wanted to make a serious point. My fears and doubts and bewilderment were noton a conscious level; and no matter how hard I tried to control them, every timeI was confronted with don Juan and don Genaro I felt helpless.\"A warrior cannot be helpless,\" he said. \"or bewildered or frightened; not underany circumstances. For a warrior there is time only for his impeccability;everything else drains his power. Impeccability replenishes it.\"\"We're back again to my old question, don Juan. What's impeccability?\"\"Yes, we're back again to your old question, and consequently we're back againto my old answer. Impeccability is to do your best in whatever you're engagedin.\"\"But don Juan, my point is that I'm always under the impression I'm doing mybest and obviously I'm not.\"\"It's not as complicated as you make it appear. The key to all these matters ofimpeccability is the sense of having or not having time. As a rule of thumb,when you feel and act like an immortal being that has all the time in the world,you are not impeccable. At those times you should turn, look around, and thenyou will realize that your feeling of having time is an idiocy. There are nosurvivors on this earth!\"================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Wings of Perception Don Juan and I spent the whole day in the mountains. We left at dawn. He took meto four places of power, and at each one of them he gave me specificinstructions on how to proceed towards the fulfillment of the particular taskthat he had outlined years before as a life situation for me. We returned in thelate afternoon. After eating, don Juan left don Genaro's house. He told me thatI had to wait for Pablito who was bringing some kerosene for the lantern, andthat I should talk to him.I became utterly absorbed in working on my notes and did not hear Pablito comein until he was next to me. Pablito's comment was that he had been practicingthe 'gait of power', and because of that I could not possibly have heard himunless I was capable of 'seeing'.I had always liked Pablito. I had not, however, had very many opportunities inthe past to be alone with him although we were good friends. Pablito had alwaysstruck me as being a most charming person. His name, of course, was Pablo, butthe diminutive, Pablito, suited him better. He was small-boned but wiry. Likedon Genaro he was lean, unsuspectedly muscular, and strong. He was perhaps inhis late twenties, but it seemed like he was eighteen. He was dark and of mediumheight. His brown eyes were clear and bright, and like don Genaro he had awinning smile with a touch of devilishness in it.I asked him about his friend Nestor; don Genaro's other apprentice. In the pastI had always seen them together, and they had always given me the impression ofhaving an excellent rapport with each other. Yet they were opposites in physicalappearance and character. While Pablito was jovial and frank, Nestor was gloomyand withdrawn. Nestor was also taller, heavier, darker, and much older.Pablito said that Nestor had finally become involved in his work with donGenaro, and that he had changed into an altogether different person since thelast time I had seen him. He did not want to elaborate any further on Nestor'swork or change of personality, and abruptly shifted the topic of conversation.\"I understand the nagual is biting your heels,\" he said.I was surprised that he knew and I asked how he had found that out.\"Genaro tells me everything,\" he said.I noticed that he did not speak of don Genaro in the same formal way I did. Hesimply called him Genaro in a familiar fashion. He said that don Genaro was likehis brother, and that they were at ease around each other as though they werefamily. He openly professed that he loved don Genaro dearly. I was deeply movedby his simplicity and candor. In talking to him, I realized how close intemperament don Juan and I were. Thus our relationship was formal and strict incomparison to don Genaro and Pablito's.I asked Pablito why he was afraid of don Juan. His eyes flickered. It was as ifthe mere thought of don Juan made him wince. He did not answer. He seemed to beassessing me in some mysterious way.\"You're not afraid of him?\" he asked.I told him I was afraid of don Genaro and he laughed as if that were the lastthing he expected to hear. He said that the difference between don Juan and donGenaro was like the difference between day and night. Don Genaro was the day.Don Juan was the night and as such he was the most frightening being on earth.Describing his fear for don Juan led Pablito to make some comments about his owncondition as an apprentice.\"I'm in a most miserable state,\" he said. \"If you could see what's in my house,you would realize that I know too much for an ordinary man; and yet if you sawme with the nagual, you would realize that I don't know enough.\"He quickly changed the subject and began to laugh at my taking notes. He saidthat don Genaro had provided hours of fun imitating me. He added that don Genaroliked me very much in spite of the oddities of my person, and that he hadexpressed his delight in my being his 'protegido'.This was the first time I had heard that term. It was congruous with anotherterm introduced by don Juan at the beginning of our association. He had told methat I was his 'escogido', the chosen one. The word 'protegido' meant theprotected one.I asked Pablito about his meetings with the 'nagual' and he told me the story ofhis first encounter with it. He said that once don Juan gave him a basket whichhe took to be a gift of good will. He placed it on a hook over the door of hisroom, and since he could not conceive any use for it at that moment he forgotabout it all day. He said that his idea was that the basket was a gift of powerand had to be put to use with something very special.During the early evening, which Pablito said was his deadly hour also, he walkedinto his room to get his jacket. He was alone in the house and was getting readyto go visit a friend. The room was dark. He grabbed the jacket and when he wasabout to reach the door the basket fell in front of him and rolled near hisfeet. Pablito said that he laughed his fright away as soon as he saw that it hadonly been the basket that had fallen from the hook.He leaned over to pick it up and got the jolt of his life. The basket jumped outof his reach and began to shake and squeak as if someone were twisting andpressing down on it. Pablito said that there was enough light coming from thekitchen to clearly distinguish everything in the room. He stared at the basketfor a moment although he felt he should not do that. The basket began toconvulse in the midst of some heavy, rasping, and difficult breathing.Pablito maintained in recounting his experience, that he actually saw and heardthe basket breathing, and that it was alive and chased him around the room,blocking his exit. He said that the basket then began to swell. All the stripsof bamboo came loose and turned into a giant ball, like a dry tumbleweed, thatrolled towards him. He fell backwards on the floor and the ball began to crawlonto his feet. Pablito said that by that time he was out of his mind, screaminghysterically. The ball had him trapped and moved on his legs like pins goingthrough him. He tried to push it away and then noticed that the ball was theface of don Juan with his mouth open ready to devour him. At that point he couldnot stand the terror and lost consciousness.Pablito, in a very frank and open manner, told me a series of terrifyingencounters that he and other members of his household had had with the 'nagual'.We spent hours talking. He seemed to be in very much the same quandary that Iwas in but he was definitely more sensitive than I in handling himself withinthe sorcerers' frame of reference.At one moment he got up and said that he felt don Juan was coming, and he didnot want to be found there. He took off with incredible speed. It was as ifsomething had pulled him out of the room. He left me in the middle of sayinggood-by.Don Juan and don Genaro came back shortly. They were laughing.\"Pablito was running down the road like a soul chased by the devil,\" don Juansaid. \"I wonder why?\"\"I think he got frightened when he saw Carlitos working his fingers to thebone,\" don Genaro said, mocking my writing.He came closer to me.\"Hey! I've got an idea,\" he said almost in a whisper. \"Since you like to writeso much, why don't you learn to write with your finger instead of a pencil.That'll be a blast.\"Don Juan and don Genaro sat by my side and laughed while they speculated aboutthe possibility of writing with one's finger. Don Juan, in a serious tone, madea strange comment. He said, \"There is no doubt that he could write with hisfinger, but would he be able to read it?\"Don Genaro doubled up with laughter and added, \"I am confident that he can readanything.\" And then he began to tell a most disconcerting tale about a countrybumpkin who became an important official during a time of political upheaval.Don Genaro said that the hero of his story was appointed minister, or governor,or perhaps even president because there was no way of telling what people woulddo in their folly. Because of this appointment, he came to believe that he wasindeed important and learned to put on an act.Don Genaro paused and examined me with the air of a ham actor overplaying hispart. He winked at me and moved his eyebrows up and down. He said that the heroof the story was very good at public appearances and could whip up a speech withno difficulty at all, but that his position required that he read his speeches,and the man was illiterate.So he used his wits to outsmart everybody. He had a sheet of paper withsomething written on it and flashed it around whenever he gave a speech. Andthus his efficiency and other good qualities were undeniable to all the countrybumpkins. But one day a literate stranger came along and noticed that the herowas reading his speech while holding the sheet upside down. He began to laughand pointed out the lie to everyone.Don Genaro again paused for a moment and looked at me, squinting his eyes, andasked, \"Do you think that the hero was caught? Not a chance. He faced everyonecalmly and said, 'Upside down? Why should the position of the sheet matter ifyou know how to read?' And the bumpkins agreed with him.\"Don Juan and don Genaro both exploded into laughter. Don Genaro patted me gentlyon the back. It was as if I were the hero of the story. I felt embarrassed andlaughed nervously. I thought that perhaps there was a hidden meaning to it, butI did not dare ask.Don Juan moved closer to me. He leaned over and whispered in my right ear,\"Don't you think it's funny?\"Don Genaro also leaned over towards me and whispered in my left ear, \"What didhe say?\" I had an automatic reaction to both questions and made an involuntarysynthesis.\"Yes. I thought he asked it's funny,\" I said.They were obviously aware of the effect of their maneuvers. They laughed untiltears rolled down their cheeks. Don Genaro, as usual, was more exaggerated thandon Juan. He fell backwards and rolled on his back a few yards away from me. Helay on his stomach, extended his arms and legs out, and whirled around on theground as though he were lying on a swivel. He whirled until he got close to meand his foot touched mine. He sat up abruptly and smiled sheepishly.Don Juan was holding his sides. He was laughing very hard and it seemed that hisstomach hurt.After a while they both leaned over and kept on whispering into my ears. I triedto memorize the sequence of their utterances but after a futile effort I gaveup. There were too many.They whispered in my ears until I again had the sensation that I had been splitin two. I became a mist like the day before; a yellow glow that sensedeverything directly. That is, I could 'know' things. There were no thoughtsinvolved. There were only certainties.And when I came into contact with a soft, spongy, bouncy feeling, which wasoutside of me and yet was part of me, I 'knew' it was a tree. I sensed it was atree by its odor. It did not smell like any specific tree I could remember,nonetheless something in me 'knew' that that peculiar odor was the 'essence' oftree. I did not have just the feeling that I knew, nor did I reason my knowledgeout, nor shuffle clues around. I simply knew that there was something there incontact with me, all around me, a friendly, warm, compelling smell emanatingfrom something which was neither solid nor liquid but an undefined somethingelse, which I 'knew' was a tree. I felt that by 'knowing' it in that manner Iwas tapping its essence. I was not repelled by it. It rather invited me to meltwith it. It engulfed me or I engulfed it. There was a bond between us which wasneither exquisite nor displeasing.The next sensation I could recollect with clarity was a wave of wonder andexultation. All of me vibrated. It was as if charges of electricity were goingthrough me. They were not painful. They were pleasing, but in such anundetermined form that there was no way of categorizing them. I knew,nevertheless, that whatever I was in contact with was the ground. Some part ofme acknowledged with concise certainty that it was the ground. But the instant Itried to discern the infinitude of direct perceptions I was having, I lost allcapacity to differentiate my perceptions.Then all of a sudden I was myself again. I was thinking. It was such an abrupttransition that I thought I had woken up. Yet there was something in the way Ifelt that was not quite myself. I knew that there was indeed something missingbefore I fully opened my eyes. I looked around. I was still in a dream, orhaving a vision of some sort.My thought processes, however, were not only unimpaired but extraordinarilyclear. I made a quick assessment. I had no doubt that don Juan and don Genarohad induced my dreamlike state for a specific purpose. I seemed to be on theverge of understanding what that purpose was when something extraneous to meforced me to pay attention to my surroundings.It took me a long moment to orient myself. I was actually lying on my stomachand what I was lying on was a most spectacular floor. As I examined it, I couldnot avoid a feeling of awe and wonder. I could not conceive what it was made of.Irregular slabs of some unknown substance had been placed in a most intricateyet simple fashion. They had been put together but were not stuck to the groundor to each other. They were elastic and gave when I attempted to pry them apartwith my fingers, but once I released the tension they went right back to theiroriginal position.I tried to get up and was seized by the most outlandish sensory distortion. Ihad no control over my body. In fact my body did not seem to be my own. It wasinert. I had no connection to any of its parts and when I tried to stand up Icould not move my arms and I wobbled helplessly on my stomach; rolling on myside. The momentum of my wobbling almost made me do a complete turn onto mystomach again. My outstretched arms and legs prevented me from turning over andI came to rest on my back.In that position I caught a glimpse of two strangely shaped legs and the mostdistorted feet I had ever seen. It was my body! I seemed to be wrapped up in atunic. The thought that came to my mind was that I was experiencing a scene ofmyself as a cripple or an invalid of some sort. I tried to curve my back andlook at my legs but I could only jerk my body. I was looking directly at ayellow sky, a deep, rich lemon-yellow sky. It had grooves or canals of a deeperyellow tone and an endless number of protuberances that hung like drops ofwater. The total effect of that incredible sky was staggering. I could notdetermine if the protuberances were clouds. There were also areas of shadows andareas of different tones of yellow which I discovered as I moved my head fromside to side.Then something else attracted my attention. A sun at the very zenith of theyellow sky, right over my head; a mild sun judging by the fact that I couldstare into it; that cast a soothing uniform whitish light.Before I had had time to ponder upon all these unearthly sights, I was violentlyshaken. My head jerked and bobbed back and forth. I felt I was being lifted. Iheard a shrill voice and giggling, and I was confronted by a most astoundingsight; a giant barefoot female. Her face was round and enormous. Her black hairwas cut in pageboy fashion. Her arms and legs were gigantic. She picked me upand lifted me to her shoulders as if I were a doll. My body hung limp. I waslooking down her strong back. She had a fine fuzz around her shoulders and downher spine. Looking down from her shoulder, I saw the magnificent floor again. Icould hear it giving elastically under her enormous weight and I could see thepressure marks that her feet left on it.She put me down on my stomach in front of a structure; some sort of building. Inoticed then that there was something wrong with my depth perception. I couldnot figure out the size of the building by looking at it. At moments it seemedridiculously small, but then after I seemingly adjusted my perception I trulymarveled at its monumental proportions.The giant girl sat next to me and made the floor squeak. I was touching herenormous knee. She smelled like candy or strawberries. She talked to me and Iunderstood everything she said. Pointing to the structure, she told me that Iwas going to live there.My prowess of observation seemed to increase as I got over the initial shock offinding myself there. I noticed then that the building had four exquisitedysfunctional columns. They did not support anything. They were on top of thebuilding. Their shape was simplicity itself. They were long and gracefulprojections that seemed to be reaching for that awesome incredibly yellow sky.The effect of those inverted columns was sheer beauty to me. I had a seizure ofaesthetic rapture.The columns seemed to have been made in one piece. I could not even conceivehow. The two columns in front were joined by a slender beam, a monumentally longrod that I thought may have served as a railing of some sort, or a verandaoverlooking the front.The giant girl made me slide on my back into the structure. The roof was blackand flat, and was covered with symmetric holes that let the yellowish glare ofthe sky show through, creating the most intricate patterns. I was truly awedwith the utter simplicity and beauty that had been achieved by those dots ofyellow sky showing through those precise holes in the roof, and the patterns ofshadows that they created on that magnificent and intricate floor. The structurewas square, and outside of its poignant beauty it was incomprehensible to me.My state of exultation was so intense at that moment that I wanted to weep, orstay there forever. But some force, or tension, or something undefinable beganto pull me. Suddenly I found myself out of the structure, still lying on myback. The giant girl was there, but there was another being with her, a woman sobig that she reached to the sky and eclipsed the sun. Compared to her the giantgirl was just a little girl. The big woman was angry. She grabbed the structureby one of its columns, lifted it up, turned it upside down, and set it on thefloor. It was a chair!That realization was like a catalyst. It triggered some overwhelmingperceptions. I went through a series of images that were disconnected but couldbe made to stand as a sequence. In successive flashes I saw or realized that themagnificent and incomprehensible floor was a straw mat. The yellow sky was thestucco ceiling of a room. The sun was a light bulb. The structure that hadevoked such rapture in me was a chair that a child had turned upside down toplay house.I had one more coherent and sequential vision of another mysteriousarchitectural structure of monumental proportions. It stood by itself. It lookedalmost like a shell of a pointed snail standing with its tail up. The walls weremade of concave and convex plates of some strange purple material; each platehad grooves that seemed more functional than ornamental.I examined the structure meticulously and in detail, and found that it was, likein the case of the previous one, thoroughly incomprehensible. I expected tosuddenly adjust my perception to disclose the 'true' nature of the structure.But nothing of the sort happened. I then had a conglomerate of alien andinextricable 'awarenesses', or 'findings', about the building and its functionwhich did not make sense because I had no frame of reference for them.I regained my normal awareness all of a sudden. Don Juan and don Genaro werenext to me. I was tired. I looked for my watch. It was gone. Don Juan and donGenaro giggled in unison. Don Juan said that I should not worry about time andthat I should concentrate on following certain recommendations that don Genarohad made to me.I turned to don Genaro and he made a joke. He said that the most importantrecommendation was that I should learn to write with my finger to save onpencils and to show off.They teased me about my notes for a while longer and then I went to sleep. Don Juan and don Genaro listened to the detailed account of my experience whichI gave them at don Juan's request after I woke up the next day.\"Genaro feels that you've got enough for the time being,\" don Juan said after Ifinished talking.Don Genaro assented with a nod.\"What was the meaning of what I experienced last night?\" I asked.\"You caught a glimpse of the most important issue of sorcery,\" don Juan said.\"Last night you peeked into the totality of yourself. But that's of course ameaningless statement for you at this moment. Obviously arriving at the totalityof oneself is not a matter of one's desire to agree, or of one's willingness tolearn. Genaro thinks that your body needs time to let the whispering of thenagual sink into you.\"Don Genaro nodded again.\"Plenty of time,\" he said, shaking his head up and down. \"Twenty or thirty yearsperhaps.\"I did not know how to react. I looked at don Juan for clues. They both hadserious expressions.\"Do I really have twenty or thirty years?\" I asked.\"Of course not!\" don Genaro yelled and they broke into laughter.Don Juan said that I should return whenever my inner voice told me to, and thatin the meantime I should try to assemble all the suggestions that they had madewhile I was split.\"How do I do that?\" I asked.\"By turning off your internal dialogue and letting something in you flow out andexpand,\" don Juan said. \"That something is your perception, but don't try tofigure out what I mean. Just let the whispering of the nagual guide you.\"Then he said that the night before I had had two sets of intrinsically differentviews. One was inexplicable; the other was perfectly natural; and the order inwhich they had happened pointed to a condition that was intrinsic to all of us.\"One view was the nagual, the other the tonal\" don Genaro added.I wanted him to explain his statement. He looked at me and patted me on theback.Don Juan stepped in and said that the first two views were the 'nagual', andthat don Genaro had selected a tree and the ground as the points for emphasis.The other two were views of the 'tonal' that he himself had selected; one ofthem was my perception of the world as an infant.\"It appeared to be an alien world to you, because your perception had not beentrimmed yet to fit the desired mold,\" he said.\"Was that the way I really saw the world?\" I asked.\"Certainly,\" he said. \"That was your memory.\"I asked don Juan whether the feeling of aesthetic appreciation that hadenraptured me was also part of my memory.\"We go into those views as we are today,\" he said. \"You were seeing that sceneas you would see it now. Yet the exercise was one of perception. That was thescene of a time when the world became for you what it is now. A time when achair became a chair.\"He did not want to discuss the other scene.\"That wasn't a memory of my childhood,\" I said.\"That's right,\" he said. \"It was something else.\"\"Was it something I will see in the future?\" I asked.\"There's no future!\" he exclaimed cuttingly. \"The future is only a way oftalking. For a sorcerer there is only the here and now.\"He said that there was essentially nothing to say about it because the purposeof the exercise had been to open the wings of my perception; and that although Ihad not flown on those wings, I had nonetheless touched four points which wouldbe inconceivable to reach from the point of view of my ordinary perception.I began to gather my things to leave. Don Genaro helped me pack my notebook. Heput it in the bottom of my briefcase.\"It'll be warm and cozy there,\" he said and winked. \"You can rest assured thatit won't catch cold.\"Then don Juan seemed to change his mind about my leaving and started to talkabout my experience. I automatically tried to grab my briefcase from donGenaro's hands but he dropped it to the floor before I touched it. Don Juan wastalking with his back turned to me. I scooped up the briefcase and hurriedlysearched for my notebook. Don Genaro had really packed it so tightly that I hada hellish time getting to it. Finally I took it out and began to write. Don Juanand don Genaro were staring at me.\"You're in terrible shape,\" don Juan said, laughing. \"You reach for yournotebook as a drunkard reaches for the bottle.\"\"As a loving mother reaches for her child,\" don Genaro snapped.\"As a priest reaches for his crucifix,\" don Juan added.\"As a woman reaches for her panties,\" don Genaro yelled.They went on and on presenting similes and howling with laughter as they walkedme to my car. ================================================================= Part Three: The Sorcerer's Explaination"},{"pageContent":"Three Witnesses to the Nagual Upon returning home, I was faced again with the task of organizing my fieldnotes. What don Juan and don Genaro had made me experience became all the morepoignant as I recapitulated the events. I noticed, however, that my usualreaction of indulging for months in bewilderment and awe over what I had gonethrough was not as intense as it had been in the past. Various times, Ideliberately attempted to engage my feelings, as I had done before, inspeculation and even in self-pity. But something was missing.I had also had the intention of writing down a number of questions to ask donJuan, don Genaro, or even Pablito. The project failed before I had begun it.There was something in me that prevented my entering into a mood of inquiry orperplexity.I did not purposely seek to go back to don Juan and don Genaro, but neither didI shy away from the possibility. One day however, without any premeditation onmy part, I simply felt that it was time to see them.In the past, every time I was about to leave for Mexico, I had always had thefeeling that there were thousands of important and pressing questions that Iwanted to ask don Juan. This time there was nothing on my mind. It was as ifafter I had worked over my notes I had become emptied of the past and ready forthe here and now of don Juan and don Genaro's world.I had to wait only a few hours before don Juan 'found' me in the market of alittle town in the mountains of central Mexico. He greeted me with utmostaffection and made a casual suggestion. He said that before we arrived at donGenaro's place, he would like to pay a visit to don Genaro's apprentices,Pablito and Nestor.As I turned off the highway he told me to keep a close watch for any unusualsight on the side of the road or on the road itself. I asked him to give me moreprecise clues about what he had in mind.\"I can't,\" he said. \"The nagual doesn't need precise clues.\"I slowed the car down in an automatic response to his reply. He laughed loudlyand signaled me with a movement of his hand to keep on driving.As we approached the town where Pablito and Nestor lived don Juan told me tostop my car. He moved his chin imperceptibly and pointed to a group of mediumsize boulders on the left side of the road.\"There's the nagual\" he said in a whisper.There was no one around. I had expected to see don Genaro. I looked at theboulders again and then I scanned the area around them. There was nothing insight. I strained my eyes to distinguish anything: a small animal, an insect, ashadow, a strange formation of the rocks, anything unusual. I gave up after amoment and turned to face don Juan. He held my questioning gaze without smilingand then gently pushed my arm with the back of his hand to make me look at theboulders again. I stared at them, then don Juan got out of the car and told meto follow him and examine them.We walked slowly on a gentle slope for about sixty or seventy yards to the baseof the rocks. He stood there for a moment and whispered in my right ear that the'nagual' was waiting for me right at that place. I told him that no matter howhard I tried, all I could distinguish were the rocks and a few tufts of weedsand some cactuses. He insisted, however, that the 'nagual' was there waiting forme.He ordered me to sit down, turn off my internal dialogue, and keep my unfocusedeyes on the top of the boulders. He sat by me, and putting his mouth to my rightear whispered that the 'nagual' had seen me, that it was there although I couldnot visualize it, and that my problem was merely one of not being capable ofcompletely shutting off my internal dialogue.I heard every word he said in a state of inner silence. I understood everything,yet I was incapable of answering. The effort needed to think and talk would havebeen impossible. My reactions to his comments were not thoughts proper butrather complete units of feeling which had all the innuendos [* innuendos-indirect implications] of meaning that I usually associate with thinking.He whispered that it was very difficult to start by oneself on the path towardsthe 'nagual', and that I was indeed most fortunate to have been launched by themoth and its song. He said that by holding the memory of the 'moth's call', Icould bring it back to aid me.His words were either an overpowering suggestion or perhaps I summoned thatperceptual phenomenon he called the 'moth's call', for no sooner had hewhispered his words to me than the extraordinary sputtering sound becameaudible. Its richness of tone made me feel as if I were inside an echo chamber.As the sound grew in loudness or proximity, I also detected, in a dreamlikestate, that something was moving on top of the boulders. The movement frightenedme so intensely that I immediately regained my crystal clear awareness. My eyesfocused on the boulders. Don Genaro was sitting on top of one of them! His feetwere dangling and with the heels of his shoes he was hammering the rock;producing a rhythmical sound that seemed to be synchronized with the 'moth'scall'. He smiled and waved his hand at me. I wanted to think rationally. I had afeeling; the desire to figure out how he got there, or how I saw him there; butI could not involve my reason at all. All I could do under the circumstances wasto look at him while he sat smiling waving his hand.After a moment he seemed to get ready to slide down the round boulder. I saw himstiffening his legs, preparing his feet for landing on the hard ground, andarching his back until it almost touched the surface of the rock in order togain sliding momentum.But in the middle of his descent his body stopped. I had the impression he gotstuck. He kicked a couple of times with both legs as if he were floating inwater. He seemed to be trying to get loose from something that had trapped himby the seat of his pants. He rubbed the sides of his buttocks frantically withboth hands. He actually gave me the impression of being painfully caught.I wanted to run to him and aid him, but don Juan held my arm. I heard him say tome, half choking with laughter, \"Watch him! Watch him!\"Don Genaro kicked, contorted his body and wiggled from side to side as if hewere loosening a nail. Then I heard a loud pop and he glided, or was hurled, towhere don Juan and I were standing. He landed four or five feet in front of meon his feet. He rubbed his buttocks and jumped up and down in a dance of painyelling profanities.\"The rock didn't want to let me go and grabbed me by the ass,\" he said to me ina sheepish tone.I experienced a sensation of unequaled joy. I laughed loudly. I noticed that mymirth was equal to my clarity of mind. I was engulfed at that moment in anoverall state of great awareness. Everything around me was crystal clear. I hadbeen drowsy or absent-minded before because of my inner silence. But thensomething in don Genaro's sudden appearance had created a state of greatlucidity.Don Genaro kept on rubbing his buttocks and jumping up and down for a whilelonger. Then he limped to my car, opened the door, and crawled into the backseat.I automatically turned around to talk to don Juan. He was not anywhere in sight.I started to call him out loud. Don Genaro got out of the car, and began to runaround in circles also calling don Juan's name in a shrill, frantic tone.It was only then as I watched him that I realized he was mimicking me. I had hadan attack of such an intense fear upon finding myself alone with don Genaro thatI had run around the car three or four times in quite an unconscious manneryelling don Juan's name.Don Genaro said that we had to pick up Pablito and Nestor, and that don Juanwould be waiting for us somewhere along the way.After I had overcome my initial fright, I told him that I was glad to see him.He teased me about my reaction. He said that don Juan was not like a father tome, but rather like a mother. He made some remarks and puns about 'mothers' thatwere utterly funny. I was laughing so hard that I did not notice that we hadarrived at Pablito's house.Don Genaro told me to stop and he got out of the car. Pablito was standing bythe door of his house. He came running and got in the car and sat next to me inthe front.\"Let's go to Nestor's place,\" he said as if he were in a hurry.I turned to look for don Genaro. He was not around. Pablito urged me in apleading voice to hurry.We drove up to Nestor's house. He was also waiting by the door. We got out ofthe car. I had the feeling that the two of them knew what was going on.\"Where are we going?\" I asked.\"Didn't Genaro tell you?\" Pablito asked me with a tone of incredulity.I assured them that neither don Juan nor don Genaro had mentioned anything tome.\"We're going to a power place,\" Pablito said.\"What are we going to do there?\" I asked.They both said in unison that they did not know. Nestor added that don Genarohad told him to guide me to the place.\"Did you come from Genaro's house?\" Pablito asked.I mentioned that I had been with don Juan and that we had found don Genaro onthe way and that don Juan had left me with him.\"Where did don Genaro go?\" I asked Pablito.But Pablito did not know what I was talking about. He had not seen don Genaro inmy car.\"He drove with me to your house,\" I said.\"I think you had the nagual in your car,\" Nestor said in a frightened tone.He did not want to sit in the back and crammed next to Pablito in the front.We drove in silence, except for Nestor's short commands to show the way.I wanted to think about the events of that morning, but somehow I knew that anyattempt to explain them was a fruitless indulging on my part. I tried to engageNestor and Pablito in a conversation. They said that they were too nervousinside the car and could not talk. I enjoyed their candid reply and did notpress them any further.After more than an hour's drive, we parked the car on a side road and climbed upthe side of a steep mountain. We walked in silence for another hour or so withNestor in the lead; and then we stopped at the bottom of a huge cliff which wasperhaps over two hundred feet high with a nearly vertical drop.With half-closed eyes Nestor scanned the ground looking for a proper place tosit. I was painfully aware that he was clumsy in his scanning movements.Pablito, who was next to me, seemed at various times to be on the verge ofstepping in and correcting him, but he restrained himself and relaxed. ThenNestor selected a place after a moment's hesitation. Pablito sighed with relief.I knew that the place Nestor had selected was the proper one, but I could notfigure out how I knew that. Thus I involved myself in the pseudo [* pseudo- notgenuine but having the appearance of] problem of imagining what place I wouldhave selected myself if I had been leading them. I could not, however, evenbegin to speculate on the procedure I would have followed. Pablito was obviouslyaware of what I was doing.\"You can't do that,\" he whispered to me.I laughed with embarrassment as if he had caught me doing something illicit.Pablito laughed and said that don Genaro always walked around in the mountainswith both of them and gave each of them the lead from time to time so he knewthat there was no way of imagining what would have been one's choice.\"Genaro says that the reason why there is no way to do that is because there areonly right and wrong choices,\" he said. \"If you make a wrong choice your bodyknows it, and so does the body of everyone else. But if you make a right choice,the body knows that and relaxes and forgets right away that there was a choice.You reload your body, see, like a gun, for the next choice. If you want to useyour body again for making the same choice, it doesn't work.\"Nestor looked at me. He was apparently curious about my taking notes. He noddedaffirmatively as if agreeing with Pablito and then smiled for the first time.Two of his upper teeth were crooked.Pablito explained that Nestor was not mean or morbid but embarrassed by histeeth and that that was the reason he never smiled. Nestor laughed, covering hismouth. I told him that I could send him to a dentist to have his teethstraightened. They thought that my suggestion was a joke and laughed like twochildren.\"Genaro says that he has to overcome the feeling of shame by himself,\" Pablitosaid. \"Besides, Genaro says that he's lucky. While everyone else bites the sameway, Nestor can split a bone lengthwise with his strong crooked teeth and he canbite a hole through your finger like a nail.\"Nestor opened his mouth and showed me his teeth. The left incisor and the caninehad grown in sideways. He made his teeth clatter by biting on them and growledlike a dog. He made two or three mock advances towards me. Pablito laughed.I had never seen Nestor so light. The few times I had been with him in the pasthe had given me the impression of being a middle-aged man. As he sat theresmiling with his crooked teeth I marveled at his youthful appearance. He lookedlike a young man in his early twenties.Pablito again read my thoughts to perfection.\"He's losing his self-importance,\" he said. \"That's why he's younger.\"Nestor nodded affirmatively and without saying a word he let out a very loudfart. I was startled and dropped my pencil.Pablito and Nestor nearly died laughing. When they had calmed down, Nestor cameto my side and showed me a homemade contraption that made a peculiar sound whensqueezed with the hand. He explained that don Genaro had showed him how to makeit.It had a minute bellows, and the vibrator could be any kind of leaf that wasplaced in a slit between the two pieces of wood that were the compressors.Nestor said that the kind of sound it produced depended on the type of leaf thatone used as a vibrator. He wanted me to try it and showed me how to squeeze thecompressors to produce a certain type of sound, and how to open them in order toproduce another.\"What do you use it for?\" I asked.They both exchanged a glance.\"That's his spirit catcher, you fool,\" Pablito said cuttingly.His tone was peevish but his smile was friendly. They were both such a strangeunnerving mixture of don Genaro and don Juan.I became absorbed in a horrible thought. Were don Juan and don Genaro playingtricks on me? I had a moment of supreme terror. But something snapped inside ofmy stomach and I instantly became calm again. I knew that Pablito and Nestorwere using don Genaro and don Juan as models for behavior. I myself had foundthat I also was behaving more and more like them.Pablito said that Nestor was lucky to have a spirit catcher and that he did nothave one himself.\"What shall we do here?\" I asked Pablito.Nestor answered as if I had addressed the question to him.\"Genaro told me that we have to wait here, and while we wait we should laugh andenjoy ourselves,\" he said.\"How long do you think we have to wait?\" I asked.He did not answer. He shook his head and looked at Pablito as if asking him.\"I have no idea,\" Pablito said.We got involved then in a lively conversation about Pablito's sisters. Nestorteased him that his oldest sister had such a mean look that she could kill licewith her eyes. He said that Pablito was afraid of her because she was so strongthat once in a fit of anger she plucked a handful of his hair as if it werechicken feathers.Pablito conceded that his oldest sister had been a beast, but that the 'nagual'had fixed her and brought her into line. After he had told me the story of howshe was made to behave, I realized that Pablito and Nestor never mentioned donJuan's name but referred to him as the 'nagual'. Apparently don Juan hadintervened in Pablito's life and coerced all his sisters into leading a moreharmonious life. Pablito said that after the 'nagual' was through with them theywere like saints.Nestor wanted to know what I did with my notes. I explained my work to them. Ihad the weird sensation that they were genuinely interested in what I was sayingand I ended up talking about anthropology and philosophy. I felt ludicrous andwanted to stop, but I found myself immersed in my elucidation and unable to cutit short. I had the unsettling sensation that both of them as a team weresomehow forcing me into that lengthy explanation. Their eyes were fixed on me.They did not seemed to be bored or tired.I was in the middle of a comment when I heard the faint sound of the 'moth'scall'. My body stiffened and I never finished my sentence.\"The nagual is here,\" I said automatically.Nestor and Pablito exchanged a look that I thought was sheer terror, and jumpedto my side and flanked me. Their mouths were open. They looked like frightenedchildren.I had an inconceivable sensory experience then. My left ear began to move. Ifelt it sort of wiggling by itself. It practically turned my head in a halfcircle until I was facing what I thought to be the east. My head tilted slightlyto the right. In that position I was capable of detecting the rich sputteringsound of the 'moth's call'. It sounded as if it were far away coming from thenortheast. Once I had established the direction, my ear picked up an incredibleamount of sounds. I had no way of knowing, however, whether they were memoriesof sounds I had heard before or actual sounds which were being produced then.The place where we were was the rugged west slope of a mountain range. Towardsthe northeast there were groves of trees and patches of mountain shrubs. My earseemed to pick up the sound of something heavy moving over rocks; coming fromthat direction.Nestor and Pablito were either responding to my actions or they themselves werehearing the same sounds. I would have liked to ask them, but I did not dare; orperhaps I was incapable of interrupting my concentration.Nestor and Pablito huddled against me, by my sides, when the sound became louderand closer. Nestor seemed to be the one who was most affected by it. His bodyshivered uncontrollably.At one moment my left arm began to shake. It raised without my volition until itwas almost level with my face, and then it pointed to an area of shrubs. I hearda vibratory sound or a roar. It was a familiar sound to me. I had heard it manyyears before under the influence of a psychotropic plant.I detected in the shrubs a gigantic black shape. It was as if the shrubsthemselves were becoming darker by degrees until they had changed into anominous blackness. It had no definite form, but it moved. It seemed to breathe.I heard a chilling scream which was mixed with the yells of terror of Pablitoand Nestor, and the shrubs, or the black shape into which they had turned, flewup towards us.I could not maintain my equanimity. Somehow something in me faltered. The shapefirst hovered over us, and then engulfed us. The light around us became opaque.It was as if the sun had set. Or as if all of a sudden it had become twilight. Ifelt Nestor and Pablito's heads under my armpits. I brought my arms down overtheir heads in an unconscious protective movement, and I fell spinningbackwards.I did not reach the rocky ground, however, for an instant later I found myselfstanding up flanked by Pablito and Nestor. Both of them, although taller than I,seemed to have shriveled. By arching their legs and backs they were actuallyshorter than I, and fit under my arms.Don Juan and don Genaro were standing in front of us. Don Genaro's eyesglittered like the eyes of a cat at night. Don Juan's eyes had the same glow. Ihad never seen don Juan look that way. He was truly awesome; more so than donGenaro. He seemed younger and stronger than usual. Looking at both of them, Ihad the maddening feeling that they were not men like myself.Pablito and Nestor whined quietly. Then don Genaro said that we were the pictureof the Trinity. I was the Father, Pablito was the Son, and Nestor the HolyGhost. Don Juan and don Genaro laughed in a booming tone. Pablito and Nestorsmiled meekly.Don Genaro said that we had to disentangle ourselves, because embraces werepermissible only between men and women, or between a man and his burro.I realized then that I was standing on the same spot I had been before, and thatobviously I had not spun backwards as I thought I had. In fact, Nestor andPablito were also on the same spot they had been on.Don Genaro signaled Pablito and Nestor with a movement of his head. Don Juansignaled me to follow them. Nestor took the lead and pointed out a sitting placefor me and another one for Pablito. We sat in a straight line, about fifty yardsfrom the place where don Juan and don Genaro stood motionless at the base of thecliff.As I kept on staring at them, my eyes went involuntarily out of focus. I knew Ihad definitely crossed them because I was seeing four of them. Then my left eyeimage of don Juan became superimposed on the right eye image of don Genaro. Theresult of the merger was that I saw an iridescent being standing in between donJuan and don Genaro. It was not a man as I ordinarily see men. It was rather aball of white fire. Something like fibers of light covered it.I shook my head. The double image was dispelled, and yet the sight of don Juanand don Genaro as luminous beings persisted. I was seeing two strange elongatedluminous objects. They looked like white iridescent footballs with fibers;fibers that had a light of their own.The two luminous beings shivered. I actually saw their fibers shaking and thenthey whizzed out of sight. They were pulled up by a long filament; a cobweb thatseemed to shoot out from the top of the cliff. The sensation I had was that along beam of light or a luminous line had dropped from the rock and lifted themup. I perceived the sequence with my eyes and with my body.I was also capable of noticing enormous disparities in my mode of perceiving,but I was incapable of speculating about them as I would have ordinarily done.Thus I was aware that I was looking straight at the base of the cliff, and yet Iwas seeing don Juan and don Genaro on the top as if I had tilted my head upforty-five degrees.I wanted to feel afraid, perhaps to cover my face and weep, or do something elsewithin my normal range of responses. But I seemed to be locked. My desires werenot thoughts as I know thoughts, therefore they could not evoke the emotionalresponse I was accustomed to eliciting [* eliciting- call forth emotions,feelings, or responses] in myself.Don Juan and don Genaro plunged to the ground. I felt that they had done sojudging by the consuming feeling of falling that I experienced in my stomach.Don Genaro remained where he had landed, but don Juan walked towards us and satdown, behind me, to my right.Nestor was in a crouching position; his legs tucked in against his stomach. Hewas resting his chin on his cupped palms. His forearms served as supports bybeing propped against his thighs.Pablito was sitting with his body slightly bent forward, holding his handsagainst his stomach. I noticed then that I had placed my forearms across myumbilical region and I was holding myself by the skin on my sides. I had grabbedmyself so hard that my sides ached.Don Juan spoke in a dry murmur, addressing all of us.\"You must fix your gaze on the nagual\" he said. \"All thoughts and words must bewashed away.\"He repeated it five or six times. His voice was strange, unknown to me. It gaveme the actual feeling of the scales on the skin of a lizard. That simile was afeeling not a conscious thought. Each of his words peeled, like scales. Therewas such an eerie rhythm to them. They were muffled; dry; like soft coughing; arhythmical murmur made into a command.Don Genaro stood motionless. As I stared at him I could not keep my imageconversion, and my eyes crossed involuntarily. In that state I noticed again astrange luminosity in don Genaro's body. My eyes were beginning to close, or totear. Don Juan came to my rescue. I heard him giving a command not to cross theeyes. I felt a soft tap on my head. He had apparently hit me with a pebble, Isaw the pebble bounce a couple of times on the rocks near me. He must have alsohit Nestor and Pablito. I heard the sound of other pebbles as they bounced onthe rocks.Don Genaro adopted a strange dancing posture. His knees were bent. His arms wereextended to his sides; his fingers outstretched. He seemed to be about to twirl.In fact, he half whirled around and then he was pulled up.I had the clear perception that he had been hoisted up by the line of a giantcaterpillar that lifted his body to the very top of the cliff. My perception ofthe upward movement was a most weird mixture of visual and bodily sensations. Ihalf saw and half felt his flight to the top. There was something that looked orfelt like a line, or an almost imperceptible thread of light pulling him up. Idid not see his flight upward in the sense I would follow a bird in flight withmy eyes. There was no linear sequence to his movement. I did not have to raisemy head to keep him within my field of vision. I saw the line pulling him, thenI felt his movement in my body or with my body, and the next instant he was onthe very top of the cliff hundreds of feet up.After a few minutes he plummeted down. I felt his falling and groanedinvoluntarily.Don Genaro repeated his feat three more times. Each time, my perception wastuned. During his last upward leap I could actually distinguish a series oflines emanating from his midsection, and I knew when he was about to ascend ordescend, judging by the way the lines of his body moved. When he was about toleap upward, the lines bent upward. The opposite happened when he was about toleap downward; the lines bent outward and down.After his fourth leap don Genaro came to us and sat down behind Pablito andNestor. Then don Juan moved to the front and stood where don Genaro had been. Hestood motionless for a while. Don Genaro gave some brief instructions to Pablitoand Nestor. I did not understand what he had said. I glanced at them and sawthat he had made each one hold a rock and place it against the area of theirnavels.I was wondering whether I also had to do that when he told me that theprecaution did not apply to me, but nonetheless I should have a rock withinreach just in case I got ill. Don Genaro jutted his chin forward to indicatethat I should gaze at don Juan, then he said something unintelligible. Herepeated it, and although I did not understand his words, I knew that it wasmore or less the same formula that don Juan had voiced.The words did not really matter: It was the rhythm, the dryness of tone, thecoughlike quality. I had the certainty that whatever language don Genaro wasusing was more appropriate than Spanish for the staccato quality of the rhythm.Don Juan did exactly as don Genaro had initially done, but then instead ofleaping upward he twirled around like a gymnast. In a semi-aware way I expectedhim to land on his feet again. He never did. His body kept on twirling a fewfeet above the ground. The circles were very rapid at first, then they sloweddown. From where I was I could see don Juan's body hanging, like don Genaro'sbody had, from a threadlike light. He whirled slowly as if allowing us to fullyview him. Then he began to ascend. He gained altitude until he reached the topof the cliff. Don Juan was actually floating as if he had no weight. His turnswere slow and evoked the image of an astronaut in space whirling around in astate of weightlessness.I got dizzy as I watched him. My feeling of getting ill seemed to trigger himand he began to whirl at a greater speed. He moved away from the cliff, and ashe gained speed I became utterly sick. I grabbed the rock and placed it on mystomach. I pressed it against my body as hard as I could. Its touch soothed me abit. The act of reaching for the rock and holding it against me had allowed me amoment's break. Although I had not taken my eyes away from don Juan, I hadnevertheless broken my concentration.Before I reached for the rock I felt that the speed which his floating body hadgained was blurring his shape. He looked like a rotating disk and then a lightthat was spinning. After I had placed the rock against my body his speeddiminished. He looked like a hat floating in the air; a kite that bobbed backand forth.The movement of the kite was even more unsettling. I became uncontrollably ill.I heard the flapping of bird wings, and after a moment of uncertainty I knewthat the event had ended.I felt so ill and exhausted that I lay down to sleep. I must have dozed off fora while. I opened my eyes when someone shook my arm. It was Pablito. He spoke tome in a frantic tone and said that I could not fall asleep because if I did allof us would die.He insisted that we had to leave right away even if we had to drag ourselves onall fours. He also seemed to be physically exhausted. In fact, I had the ideathat we should spend the night there. The prospect of walking to my car in thedark seemed most dreadful to me. I tried to convince Pablito who was gettingmore frantic. Nestor was so ill that he was indifferent.Pablito sat down in a state of total despair. I made an effort to organize mythoughts. It was quite dark by then although there was still enough light todistinguish the rocks around us. The quietness was exquisite and soothing. Ienjoyed the moment fully, but suddenly my body jumped. I heard the distant soundof a branch being cracked. I automatically turned to Pablito. He seemed to knowwhat had happened to me. We grabbed Nestor by the armpits and practically liftedhim up. We dragged him and ran. He apparently was the only one who knew the way.He gave us short commands from time to time.I was not concerned with what we did. My attention was focused on my left earwhich seemed to be a unit independent from the rest of me. Some feeling in meforced me to stop every so often and scan the surroundings with my ear. I knewsomething was following us. It was something massive. It crushed small rocks asit advanced.Nestor regained a degree of composure and walked by himself, holding on toPablito's arm occasionally.We arrived at a group of trees. By then it was completely dark. I heard a suddenand extremely loud cracking sound. It was like the cracking of a monstrous whipthat lashed the tops of the trees. I could feel a wave of some sort ripplingoverhead.Pablito and Nestor screamed and scrambled out of there at full speed. I wantedthem to stop. I was not sure I could run in the dark. But at that instant Iheard and felt a series of heavy exhalations right behind me. My fright wasindescribable.The three of us ran together until we reached the car. Nestor led us in someunknown way.I thought that I should leave them at their houses and then go to a hotel intown: I would not have gone to don Genaro's place for anything in the world.But Nestor did not want to leave the car; neither did Pablito and neither did I.We ended up at Pablito's house. He sent Nestor to buy some beer and cola whilehis mother and sisters prepared food for us. Nestor made a joke and asked if hecould be escorted by the oldest sister in case he was attacked by dogs ordrunkards. Pablito laughed and told me that he had been entrusted with Nestor.\"Who has entrusted you with him?\" I asked.\"Power, of course!\" he replied. \"At one time Nestor was older than me, butGenaro did something to him and now he's much younger. You saw that, didn'tyou?\"\"What did don Genaro do?\" I asked.\"You know, he made him a child again. He was too important and heavy. Hewould've died if he was not turned younger.\"There was something truly candid and endearing about Pablito. The simplicity ofhis explanation was overwhelming to me. Nestor was indeed younger. Not only didhe look younger, but he acted like an innocent child. I knew without any doubtthat he genuinely felt like one.\"I take care of him,\" Pablito continued. \"Genaro says that it's an honor to lookafter a warrior. Nestor is a fine warrior.\"His eyes shone, like don Genaro's. He patted me vigorously on the back andlaughed.\"Wish him well, Carlitos,\" he said. \"Wish him well.\"I was very tired. I had a strange surge of happy sadness. I told him that I camefrom a place where people rarely if ever wish one another well.\"I know,\" he said. \"The same thing happened to me. But I'm a warrior now and Ican afford to wish him well.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Strategy of a Sorcerer Don Juan was at don Genaro's house when I got there in the late morning. Igreeted him.\"Hey, what happened to you? Genaro and I waited for you all night,\" he said.I knew that he was joking. I felt light and happy. I had systematically refusedto dwell on whatever I had witnessed the day before. At that moment, however, mycuriosity was uncontrollable and I asked him about it.\"Oh, that was a simple demonstration of all the things that you should knowbefore you get the sorcerers' explanation,\" he said. \"What you did yesterdaymade Genaro feel that you have stored enough power to go for the real thing.You have obviously followed his suggestions. Yesterday you let the wings of yourperception unfold. You were stiff but you still perceived all the comings andgoings of the nagual. In other words, you saw. You also confirmed somethingwhich at this time is even more important than seeing, and that was the factthat you can now place your unwavering attention on the nagual. And that's whatwill decide the outcome of the last issue, the sorcerers' explanation.\"Pablito and you will go into it at the same time. It is a gift of power to beaccompanied by such a fine warrior.\"That seemed to be all he wanted to say. After a while I asked about don Genaro.\"He's around,\" he said. \"He went into the bushes to make the mountains tremble.\"I heard at that moment a distant rumble, like muffled thunder. Don Juan lookedat me and laughed.He made me sit down and asked if I had eaten. I had, so he handed me my notebookand led me to don Genaro's favorite spot; a large rock on the west side of thehouse overlooking a deep ravine.\"Now is when I need your total attention,\" don Juan said. \"Attention in thesense that warriors understand attention; a true pause in order to allow thesorcerers' explanation to fully soak through you.\"We are at the end of our task. All the necessary instruction has been given toyou and now you must stop, look back, and reconsider your steps. Sorcerers saythat this is the only way to consolidate one's gains. I definitely would havepreferred to tell you all this at your own place of power, but Genaro is yourbenefactor and his spot may be more beneficial to you in an instance like this.\"What he was referring to as my 'place of power' was a hilltop in the desert ofnorthern Mexico which he had shown me years before and had 'given' to me as myown.\"Should I just listen to you without taking notes?\" I asked.\"This is indeed a tricky maneuver,\" he said. \"On the one hand I need your totalattention, and on the other you need to be calm and self-assured. The only wayfor you to be at ease is to write, so this is the time to bring forth all yourpersonal power and fulfill this impossible task of being yourself without beingyourself.\"He slapped his thigh and laughed.\"I've already told you that I am in charge of your tonal and that Genaro is incharge of your nagual\" he went on. \"It has been my duty to help you in everymatter concerning your tonal and everything that I've done with you or to youwas done to accomplish one single task, the task of cleaning and reordering yourisland of the tonal. That's my job as your teacher. Genaro's task as yourbenefactor is to give you undeniable demonstrations of the nagual and to showhow to get to it.\"\"What do you mean by cleaning and reordering the island of the tonal?\" I asked.\"I mean the total change which I've been telling you about from the first day wemet,\" he said. \"I've told you countless times that a most drastic change wasneeded if you wanted to succeed in the path of knowledge. That change is not achange of mood, or attitude, or outlook. That change entails the transformationof the island of the tonal. You have accomplished that task.\"\"Do you think that I've changed?\" I asked.He hesitated and then laughed loudly.\"You are as idiotic as ever,\" he said. \"And yet you're not the same. See what Imean?\"He mocked my taking notes and said that he missed don Genaro, who would haveenjoyed the absurdity of my writing down the sorcerers' explanation.\"At this precise point a teacher would usually say to his disciple that theyhave arrived at a final crossroad,\" he continued. \"To say such a thing ismisleading, though. In my opinion there is no final crossroad, no final step toanything. And since there is no final step to anything, there shouldn't be anysecrecy about any part of our lot as luminous beings. Personal power decides whocan or who cannot profit by a revelation.\"My experiences with my fellow men have proven to me that very, very few of themwould be willing to listen. And of those few who listen, even fewer would bewilling to act on what they have listened to. And of those who are willing toact even fewer have enough personal power to profit by their acts.\"So, the matter of secrecy about the sorcerers' explanation boils down to aroutine; perhaps a routine as empty as any other routine.\"At any rate, you know now about the tonal and the nagual, which are the core ofthe sorcerers' explanation. To know about them seems to be quite harmless. Weare sitting here talking innocently about them as if they were just an ordinarytopic of conversation. You are calmly writing as you've done for years. Thescenery around us is a picture of calmness. It is early afternoon. The day isbeautiful. The mountains around us have made a protective cocoon for us.One doesn't have to be a sorcerer to realize that this place, which speaks ofGenaro's power and impeccability, is the most appropriate background for openingthe door. For that is what I'm doing today; opening the door for you. But beforewe venture beyond this point a fair warning is required. A teacher is supposedto speak in earnest terms and warn his disciple that the harmlessness andplacidity of this moment are a mirage, that there is a bottomless abyss in frontof him, and that once the door opens there is no way to close it again.\" Hepaused for a moment.I felt light and happy. From don Genaro's place of predilection I had abreathtaking view. Don Juan was right. The day and the scenery were more thanbeautiful. I wanted to worry about his admonitions and warnings, but somehow thetranquility around me screened out all my attempts and I found myself hopingthat perhaps he was speaking only of metaphorical dangers. Don Juan suddenlybegan to talk again.\"The years of hard training are only a preparation for the warrior's devastatingencounter with...\"He paused again, looked at me with squinting eyes, and chuckled. \"...withwhatever lies out there, beyond this point,\" he said. I asked him to explain hisominous statements.\"The sorcerers' explanation, which doesn't seem like an explanation at all, islethal,\" he said. \"It seems harmless and charming, but as soon as the warrioropens himself to it, it delivers a blow that no one can parry.\"He broke into a loud laugh.\"So, be prepared for the worst, hut don't hurry or panic,\" he proceeded. \"Youdon't have any time, and yet you're surrounded by eternity. What a paradox foryour reason!\"Don Juan stood up. He wiped off the debris on a smooth bowl-like depression, andsat there comfortably with his back against the rock; facing the northwest. Heindicated another place for me where I too could sit comfortably. I was to hisleft, also facing the northwest. The rock was warm and gave me a feeling ofserenity; of protection. It was a mild day. A soft wind made the heat of theafternoon sun very pleasant. I took off my hat but don Juan insisted that Ishould wear it.\"You're now facing in the direction of your own place of power,\" he said. \"Thatis a prop that may protect you. Today you need all the props you can use. Yourhat may be another one of them.\"\"Why are you warning me, don Juan? What's really going to happen?\" I asked.\"What will happen here today depends on whether or not you have enough personalpower to focus your unwavering attention on the wings of your perception,\" hesaid.His eyes glittered. He seemed to be more excited than I had ever seen himbefore. I thought that there was something unusual in his voice; perhaps anunaccustomed nervousness.Back to Home PageDon Juan said that the occasion required that right there on my benefactor'splace of predilection he recapitulate for me every step that he had taken in hisstruggle to help me clean and reorder my island of the 'tonal'. Hisrecapitulation was meticulous, and took him about five hours.In a brilliant and clear manner he gave me a succinct account of everything hehad done to me since the day we met. It was as if a dam had been broken. Hisrevelations caught me completely off guard. I had accustomed myself to be theaggressive prober; thus, to have don Juan- who was always the reluctant party-elucidating the points of his teachings in such an academic manner was asastounding as his wearing a suit in Mexico City. His control of the language,his dramatic timing, and his choice of words were so extraordinary that I had noway to explain them rationally.He said that at that point a teacher had to speak to the individual warrior inexclusive terms; that the way he was talking to me and the clarity of hisexplanation were part of his last trick; and that only at the end wouldeverything that he was doing make sense to me. He talked without stopping, untilhe had finished presenting his recapitulation. And I wrote down everything hesaid without any conscious effort on my part.\"Let me begin by telling you that a teacher never seeks apprentices and no onecan solicit the teachings,\" he said. \"It's always an omen which points out anapprentice. A warrior who may be in the position of becoming a teacher must bealert in order to catch his cubic centimenter of chance. I saw you just beforewe met. You had a good tonal, like that girl we encountered in Mexico City.After I saw you I waited, very much like what we did with the girl that night inthe park. The girl went by without paying attention to us. But you were broughtto me by a man who ran away after babbling inanities. You were left there,facing me, also babbling inanities. I knew I had to act fast and hook you. Youyourself would've had to do something of that sort if that girl would've talkedto you. What I did was to grab you with my will.\"Don Juan was alluding to the extraordinary way he had looked at me the day wemet. He had fixed his gaze on me and I had had an inexplicable feeling ofvacuity, or numbness. I could not find any logical explanation for my reactionand I have always believed that after our first meeting I went back to see himonly because I had become obsessed with that look.\"That was my quickest way of hooking you,\" he said. \"It was a direct blow toyour tonal. I numbed it by focusing my will on it.\"\"How did you do that?\" I asked.\"The warrior's gaze is placed on the right eye of the other person,\" he said.\"and what it does is to stop the internal dialogue. Then the nagual takes over;thus, the danger of that maneuver. Whenever the nagual prevails, even if it isonly for an instant, there is no way of describing the feeling that the bodyexperiences. I know that you have spent endless hours trying to figure out whatyou felt, and that to this day you haven't been able to. I accomplished what Iwanted, though. I hooked you.\"I told him that I could still remember him staring at me.\"The gaze on the right eye is not a stare,\" he said. \"It's rather a forcefulgrabbing that one does through the eye of the other person. In other words, onegrabs something that is behind the eye. One has the actual physical sensationthat one is holding something with the will.\"He scratched his head, tilting his hat to the front, over his face.\"This is, naturally, only a way of talking,\" he continued. \"A way of explainingweird physical sensations.\"He ordered me to stop writing and look at him. He said that he was going to'grab' my 'tonal' gently with his 'will'. The sensation I experienced was arepetition of what I had felt on that first day we had met, and on otheroccasions when don Juan had made me feel that his eyes were actually touching mein a physical sense.\"But, how do you make me feel you're touching me, don Juan? What do you actuallydo?\" I asked.\"There's no way of exactly describing what one does,\" he said. \"Something snapsforward from someplace below the stomach. That something has direction and canbe focused on anything.\"I again felt something like soft tweezers clasping some undefined part of me.\"It works only when the warrior learns to focus his will\" don Juan explainedafter he moved his eyes away. \"There's no way of practicing it, therefore I havenot recommended or encouraged its use. At a given moment in the life of awarrior it simply happens. No one knows how.\"He remained quiet for a while. I felt extremely apprehensive. Don Juan suddenlybegan to speak again.\"The secret is in the left eye,\" he said. \"As a warrior progresses on the pathof knowledge his left eye can clasp anything. Usually the left eye of a warriorhas a strange appearance. Sometimes it becomes permanently crossed, or itbecomes smaller than the other, or larger, or different in some way.\"He glanced at me and in a joking manner pretended to examine my left eye. Heshook his head in mock disapproval and chuckled.\"Once the apprentice has been hooked, the instruction begins,\" he continued.\"The first act of a teacher is to introduce the idea that the world we think wesee is only a view, a description of the world. Every effort of a teacher isgeared to prove this point to his apprentice.\"But accepting it seems to be one of the hardest things one can do. We arecomplacently caught in our particular view of the world, which compels us tofeel and act as if we knew everything about the world. A teacher, from the veryfirst act he performs, aims at stopping that view. Sorcerers call it stoppingthe internal dialogue, and they are convinced that it is the single mostimportant technique that an apprentice can learn.\"In order to stop the view of the world which one has held since the cradle, itis not enough to just wish or make a resolution. One needs a practical task.That practical task is called the right way of walking. It seems harmless andnonsensical. As everything else which has power in itself or by itself, theright way of walking does not attract attention. You understood it and regardedit, at least for several years, as a curious way of behaving. It didn't dawn onyou until very recently that that was the most effective way to stop yourinternal dialogue.\"\"How does the right way of walking stop the internal dialogue?\" I asked.\"Walking in that specific manner saturates the tonal\" he said. \"It floods it.You see, the attention of the tonal has to be placed on its creations. In fact,it is that attention that creates the order of the world in the first place. Sothe tonal must be attentive to the elements of its world in order to maintainit, and must, above all, uphold the view of the world as internal dialogue.\"He said that the right way of walking was a subterfuge. [* subterfuge- somethingintended to misrepresent the true nature of an activity] The warrior, first bycurling his fingers, draws attention to the arms. Then by looking withoutfocusing his eyes at any point directly in front of him on the arc that startsat the tip of his feet and ends above the horizon, he literally flooded his'tonal' with information.The 'tonal', without its one-to-one relation with the elements of itsdescription, was incapable of talking to itself and thus one became silent.Don Juan explained that the position of the fingers did not matter at all; thatthe only consideration was to draw attention to the arms by clasping the fingersin various unaccustomed ways; and that the important thing was the manner inwhich the eyes by being kept unfocused detected an enormous number of featuresof the world without being clear about them. He added that the eyes in thatstate were capable of picking out details which were too fleeting for normalvision.\"Together with the right way of walking,\" don Juan went on, \"a teacher mustteach his apprentice another possibility which is even more subtle; thepossibility of acting without believing; without expecting rewards; acting justfor the hell of it. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I told you that the success ofa teacher's enterprise depends on how well and how harmoniously he guides hisapprentice in this specific respect.\"I told don Juan that I did not remember him ever discussing 'acting just for thehell of it' as a particular technique. All I could recollect were his constantbut loose comments about it.He laughed and said that his maneuver had been so subtle that it had bypassed meto that day. He then reminded me of all the nonsensical joking tasks that heused to give me every time I had been at his house: absurd chores such asarranging firewood in patterns, encircling his house with an unbroken chain ofconcentric circles drawn in the dirt with my finger, sweeping debris from oneplace to another, and so forth. The tasks also included acts that I had toperform by myself at home: such as wearing a black cap, or tying my left shoefirst, or fastening my belt from right to left.The reason I had never taken them in any other vein except as jokes was that hewould invariably tell me to forget about them after I had established them asregular routines.As he recapitulated all the tasks he had given me I realized that by making meperform senseless routines he had indeed implanted in me the idea of actingwithout really expecting anything in return.\"Stopping the internal dialogue is, however, the key to the sorcerers' world,\"he said. \"The rest of the activities are only props. All they do is acceleratethe effect of stopping the internal dialogue.\"He said that there were two major activities or techniques used to acceleratethe stopping of the internal dialogue: erasing personal history and 'dreaming'.He reminded me that during the early stages of my apprenticeship he had given mea number of specific methods for changing my 'personality'. I had recorded themin my notes and had forgotten about them for years until I realized theirimportance. Those specific methods seemed at first to be highly idiosyncratic [*idiosyncratic- peculiar to the individual] devices to coerce me into modifyingmy behavior.He explained that the art of a teacher was to deviate the apprentice's attentionfrom the main issues. A poignant example of that art was the fact that I had notrealized until that day that he had actually tricked me into learning a mostcrucial point; to act without expecting rewards.He said that in line with that rationale he had rallied my interest around theidea of 'seeing', which, properly understood, was the act of dealing directlywith the 'nagual': an act that was an unavoidable end result of the teachingsbut an unattainable task as a task per se.\"What was the point of tricking me that way?\" I asked.\"Sorcerers are convinced that all of us are a bunch of nincompoops,\" he said.\"We can never relinquish our crummy control voluntarily, thus we have to betricked.\"His contention was that by making me focus my attention on a pseudo task,learning to 'see', he had successfully accomplished two things. First he hadoutlined the direct encounter with the 'nagual' without mentioning it, andsecond he had tricked me into considering the real issues of his teachings asinconsequential affairs. Erasing personal history and 'dreaming' were never asimportant to me as 'seeing'. I regarded them as very entertaining activities. Ieven thought that they were the practices for which I had the greatest facility.\"Greatest facility,\" he said mockingly when he heard my comments. \"A teachermust not leave anything to chance. I've told you that you were correct infeeling that you were being tricked. The problem was that you were convincedthat that tricking was directed at fooling your reason. For me, tricking meantto distract your attention, or to trap it as the case required.\"He looked at me with squinting eyes and pointed all around us with a sweepinggesture of his arm.\"The secret of all this is one's attention,\" he said.\"What do you mean, don Juan?\"\"All of this exists only because of our attention. This very rock where we'resitting is a rock because we have been forced to give our attention to it as arock.\"I wanted him to explain that idea. He laughed and raised an accusing finger atme.\"This is a recapitulation,\" he said. \"We'll get to that later.\"He asserted that because of his decoy maneuver I became interested in erasingpersonal history and 'dreaming'. He said that the effects of those twotechniques were ultimately devastating if they were exercised in their totality,and that then his concern was the concern of every teacher; not to let hisapprentice do anything that would plunge him into aberration and morbidity.\"Erasing personal history and dreaming should only be a help,\" he said. \"Whatany apprentice needs to buffer him is temperance and strength. That's why ateacher introduces the warrior's way, or living like a warrior. This is the gluethat joins together everything in a sorcerer's world. Bit by bit a teacher mustforge and develop it. Without the sturdiness and level-headedness of thewarrior's way there is no possibility of withstanding the path of knowledge.\"Don Juan said that learning the warrior's way was an instance when theapprentice's attention had to be trapped rather than deviated, and that he hadtrapped my attention by pushing me out of my ordinary circumstances every time Ihad gone to see him. Our roaming around the desert and the mountains had beenthe means to accomplish that.The maneuver of altering the context of my ordinary world by taking me for hikesand hunting was another instance of his system that had bypassed me. Contextdisarrangement meant that I did not know the ropes and my attention had to befocused on everything don Juan did.\"What a trick! Uh?\" he said and laughed.I laughed with awe. I had never realized that he was so aware.He then enumerated his steps in guiding and trapping my attention. When he hadfinished his account he added that a teacher had to take into consideration thepersonality of the apprentice, and that in my case he had to be careful becauseI was violent and would have thought nothing of killing myself out of despair.\"What a preposterous fellow you are, don Juan,\" I said in jest, and he explodedin a giant laugh.He explained that in order to help erase personal history, three othertechniques were taught. They were: losing self-importance, assumingresponsibility, and using death as an adviser. The idea was that without thebeneficial effect of those three techniques, erasing personal history wouldinvolve the apprentice in being shifty, evasive and unnecessarily dubious abouthimself and his actions.Don Juan asked me to tell him what had been the most natural reaction I had hadin moments of stress, frustration and disappointment before I became anapprentice. He said that his own reaction had been wrath. I told him that minehad been self-pity.\"Although you're not aware of it, you had to work your head off to make thatfeeling a natural one,\" he said. \"By now there is no way for you to recollectthe immense effort that you needed to establish self-pity as a feature of yourisland. Self-pity bore witness to everything you did. It was just at yourfingertips, ready to advise you.\"Death is considered by a warrior to be a more amenable adviser which can alsobe brought to bear witness on everything one does; just like self-pity, orwrath. Obviously after an untold struggle you had learned to feel sorry foryourself. But you can also learn, in the same way, to feel your impending end;and thus you can learn to have the idea of your death at your fingertips. As anadviser, self-pity is nothing in comparison to death.\"Don Juan pointed out then that there was seemingly a contradiction in the ideaof change. On the one hand, the sorcerers' world called for a drastictransformation, and on the other, the sorcerers' explanation said that theisland of the 'tonal' was complete and not a single element of it could beremoved. Change, then, did not mean obliterating anything, but rather alteringthe use assigned to those elements.\"Take self-pity for instance,\" he said. \"There is no way to get rid of it forgood; it has a definite place and character in your island, a definite facadewhich is recognizable. Thus, every time the occasion arises, self-pity becomesactive. It has history. If you then change the facade of self-pity, you wouldhave shifted its place of prominence.\"I asked him to explain the meaning of his metaphors, especially the idea ofchanging facades. I understood it as perhaps the act of more than one role atthe same time.\"One changes the facade by altering the use of the elements of the island,\" hereplied. \"Take self-pity again. It was useful to you because you either feltimportant and deserving of better conditions, better treatment; or because youwere unwilling to assume responsibility for the acts that brought you to thestate that elicited self-pity; or because you were incapable of bringing theidea of your impending death to witness your acts and advise you.\"Erasing personal history and its three companion techniques are the sorcerers'means for changing the facade of the elements of the island. For instance, byerasing your personal history, you have denied use to self-pity. In order forself-pity to work you had to feel important, irresponsible, and immortal. Whenthose feelings were altered in some way, it was no longer possible for you tofeel sorry for yourself.\"The same was true with all the other elements which you've changed on yourisland. Without using those four techniques you never could've succeeded inchanging them. But changing facades means only that one has assigned a secondaryplace to a formerly important element. Your self-pity is still a feature of yourisland; it will be there in the back in the same way that the idea of yourimpending death, or your humbleness, or your responsibility for your acts werethere without ever being used.\"Don Juan said that once all those techniques had been presented, the apprenticearrived at a crossroad. Depending on his sensibility, the apprentice did one oftwo things. He either took the recommendations and suggestions made by histeacher at their face value and acted without expecting rewards, or he tookeverything as a joke or an aberration.I remarked that in my own case I was confused by the word 'techniques'. I alwaysexpected a set of precise directions, but he had given me only vaguesuggestions; and I was incapable of taking them seriously or acting inaccordance with his stipulations.\"That was your mistake,\" he said. \"I had to decide then whether or not to usepower plants. You could've used those four techniques to clean and reorder yourisland of the tonal. They would've led you to the nagual. But not all of us arecapable of reacting to simple recommendations. You, and I for that matter,needed something else to shake us. We needed those power plants.\"It had indeed taken me years to realize the importance of those earlysuggestions made by don Juan. The extraordinary effect that psychotropic plantshad had on me was what gave me the bias that their use was the key feature ofthe teachings. I held on to that conviction and it was only in the later yearsof my apprenticeship that I realized that the meaningful transformations andfindings of sorcerers were always done in states of sober consciousness.\"What would have happened if I had taken your recommendations seriously?\" Iasked.\"You would have gotten to the nagual\" he replied.\"But would I have gotten to the nagual without a benefactor?\"\"Power provides according to your impeccability,\" he said. \"If you had seriouslyused those four techniques, you would've stored enough personal power to find abenefactor. You would've been impeccable and power would have opened all thenecessary avenues. That is the rule.\"\"Why didn't you give me more time?\" I asked.\"You had all the time you needed,\" he said. \"Power showed me the way. One nightI gave you a riddle to work out. You had to find your beneficial spot in frontof the door of my house. That night you performed marvelously under pressure andin the morning you fell asleep over a very special rock that I had put there.Power showed me that you had to be pushed mercilessly or you wouldn't do athing.\"\"Did the power plants help me?\" I asked.\"Certainly,\" he said. \"They opened you up by stopping your view of the world. Inthis respect power plants have the same effect on the tonal as the right way ofwalking. Both flood it with information and force the internal dialogue to cometo a stop. The plants are excellent for that, but very costly. They cause untolddamage to the body. This is their drawback, especially with the devil's weed.\"\"If you knew that they were so dangerous, why did you give me so many of them,so many times?\" I asked.He assured me that the details of the procedure were decided by power itself. Hesaid that although the teachings were supposed to cover the same issues with allapprentices, the order was different for each one, and that he had gottenrepeated indications that I needed a great deal of coercion in order to botherwith anything.\"I was dealing with a sassy immortal being that had no respect for his life orhis death,\" he said, laughing.I brought up the fact that he had described and discussed those plants in termsof anthropomorphic [* anthropomorphic- suggesting human characteristics foranimals or inanimate things] qualities. His references to them were always as ifthe plants had personalities. He replied that that was a prescribed means fordeviating the apprentice's attention away from the real issue, which wasstopping the internal dialogue.\"If they are used only to stop the internal dialogue, what's their connectionwith the ally?\" I asked.\"That's a difficult point to explain,\" he said. \"Those plants lead theapprentice directly to the nagual, and the ally is an aspect of it. We functionat the center reason exclusively, regardless of who we are or where we comefrom. Reason can naturally account in one way or another for everything thathappens within its view of the world.\"The ally is something which is outside of that view; outside the realm ofreason. It can be witnessed only at the center of will at times when ourordinary view has stopped, therefore it is properly the nagual. Sorcerers,however, can learn to perceive the ally in a most intricate way, and in doing sothey get too deeply immersed in a new view.\"So, in order to protect you from that fate, I did not emphasize the ally assorcerers usually do. Sorcerers have learned after generations of using powerplants to account in their views for everything that is accountable about them.I would say that sorcerers, by using their will, have succeeded in enlargingtheir views of the world. My teacher and benefactor were the clearest examplesof that. They were men of great power, but they were not men of knowledge.\"They never broke the bounds of their enormous views and thus never arrived atthe totality of themselves, yet they knew about it. It wasn't that they livedaberrant lives, claiming things beyond their reach; they knew that they hadmissed the boat and that only at their death would the total mystery be revealedto them. Sorcery had given them only a glimpse but never the real means to getto that evasive totality of oneself.\"I gave you enough of the sorcerers' view without letting you get hooked by it.I said that only if one pits two views against each other can one weasel betweenthem to arrive at the real world. I meant that one can arrive at the totality ofoneself only when one fully understands that the world is merely a view,regardless of whether that view belongs to an ordinary man or to a sorcerer.\"Here is where I varied from the tradition. After a lifelong struggle I knowthat what matters is not to learn a new description, but to arrive at thetotality of oneself. One should get to the nagual without maligning the tonal,and above all, without injuring one's body. You took those plants following theexact steps I followed myself. The only difference was that instead of plungingyou into them I stopped when I judged that you had stored enough views of thenagual. That is the reason why I never wanted to discuss your encounters withpower plants, or let you talk obsessively about them. There was no point inelaborating about the unspeakable. Those were true excursions into the nagual,the unknown.\"I mentioned that my need to talk about my perceptions under the influence ofpsychotropic plants was due to an interest in elucidating a hypothesis of myown. I was convinced that with the aid of such plants he had provided me withmemories of inconceivable ways of perceiving. Those memories, which at the timeI experienced them may have seemed idiosyncratic and disconnected from anythingmeaningful, were later assembled into units of meaning. I knew that don Juan hadartfully guided me each time, and that any assembling of meaning was made underhis guidance.\"I don't want to emphasize those events, or explain them,\" he said dryly. \"Theact of dwelling on explanations will put us right back where we don't want tobe. That is, we'll be thrown back into a view of the world; this time a muchlarger view.\"Don Juan said that after the apprentice's internal dialogue has been stopped bythe effect of power plants, an unavoidable impasse develops. The apprenticebegins to have second thoughts about his whole apprenticeship. In don Juan'sopinion, even the most willing apprentice at that point would suffer a seriousloss of interest.\"Power plants shake the tonal and threaten the solidity of the whole island,\" hesaid. \"It is at this time that the apprentice retreats, and wisely so. He wantsto get out of the whole mess. It is also at this time that the teacher sets uphis most artful trap, the worthy opponent.\"This trap has two purposes. First, it enables the teacher to hold hisapprentice, and second, it enables the apprentice to have a point of referencefor further use. The trap is a maneuver that brings forth a worthy opponent intothe arena. Without the aid of a worthy opponent, who is not really an enemy buta thoroughly dedicated adversary, the apprentice has no possibility ofcontinuing on the path of knowledge. The best of men would quit at this point ifit were left up to them to decide. I brought to you as a worthy opponent thefinest warrior one can find, la Catalina.\"Don Juan was talking about a time, years before, when he had led me into along-range battle with an Indian sorceress.\"I put you in bodily contact with her,\" he proceeded. \"I chose a woman becauseyou trust women. To disarrange that trust was very difficult for her. Sheconfessed to me years later that she would've liked to quit because she likedyou. But she's a great warrior and in spite of her feelings she nearly blastedyou off the planet.\"She disarranged your tonal so intensely that it was never the same again. Sheactually changed features on the face of your island so deeply that her actssent you into another realm. One may say that she could've become yourbenefactor herself, had it not been that you were not cut out to be a sorcererlike she is.\"There was something amiss between you two. You were incapable of being afraidof her. You nearly lost your marbles one night when she accosted you, but inspite of that you were attracted to her. She was a desirable woman to you nomatter how scared you were. She knew that. I caught you one day in town lookingat her, shaking in your boots with fear and yet drooling at her.\"Because of the acts of a worthy opponent, then, an apprentice can be eitherblasted to pieces or changed radically. La Catalina's actions with you, sincethey did not kill you- not because she did not try hard enough, but because youwere durable- had a beneficial effect on you, and also provided you with adecision.\"The teacher uses the worthy opponent to force the apprentice into the choice ofhis life. The apprentice must choose between the warrior's world and hisordinary world. But no decision is possible unless the apprentice understandsthe choice. Thus a teacher must have a thoroughly patient and understandingattitude, and must lead his man with a sure hand to that choice; and above allhe must make sure that his apprentice chooses the world and the life of awarrior. I accomplished this by asking you to help me overcome la Catalina. Itold you she was about to kill me and that I needed your help to get rid of her.I gave you fair warning about the consequences of your choice and plenty of timeto decide whether or not to make it.\"I clearly remembered that don Juan had set me loose that day. He told me that ifI did not want to help him I was free to leave and never come back. I felt atthat moment that I was at liberty to choose my own course and had no furtherobligation to him.I left his house and drove away with a mixture of sadness and happiness. I wassad to leave don Juan and yet I was happy to be through with all hisdisconcerting activities. I thought of Los Angeles and my friends and all theroutines of my daily life which were waiting for me; those little routines thathad always given me so much pleasure. For a while I felt euphoric. The weirdnessof don Juan and his life was behind me and I was free.My happy mood did not last long, however. My desire to leave don Juan's worldwas untenable. My routines had lost their power. I tried to think of something Iwanted to do in Los Angeles, but there was nothing. Don Juan had once told methat I was afraid of people and had learned to defend myself by not wantinganything. He said that not wanting anything was a warrior's finest attainment.In my stupidity, however, I had enlarged the sensation of not wanting anythingand made it lapse into not liking anything. Thus, my life was boring and empty.He was right, and as I zoomed north on the highway the full impact of my ownunsuspected madness finally hit me. I began to realize the scope of my choice. Iwas actually leaving a magical world of continual renewal for my soft, boringlife in Los Angeles. I began to recollect my empty days. I remembered one Sundayin particular. I had felt restless all day with nothing to do. No friends hadcome to visit me. No one had invited me to a party. The people I wanted to seewere not home, and worst of all, I had seen all the movies in town. In the lateafternoon, in ultimate despair, I searched the list of movies again and foundone I had never wanted to see. It was being shown in a town thirty-five milesaway. I went to see it, and hated it, but even that was better than havingnothing to do.Under the impact of don Juan's world, I had changed. For one thing, since I hadmet him I had not had time to be bored. That in itself was enough for me. DonJuan had indeed made sure I would choose the warrior's world. I turned aroundand drove back to his house.\"What would have happened if I had chosen to go back to Los Angeles?\" I asked.\"That would have been an impossibility,\" he said. \"That choice didn't exist. Allthat was required of you was to allow your tonal to become aware of havingdecided to join the world of sorcerers. The tonal doesn't know that decisionsare in the realm of the nagual. When we think we decide, all we're doing isacknowledging that something beyond our understanding has set up the frame ofour so-called decision, and all we do is to acquiesce.\"In the life of a warrior there is only one thing- one issue alone which isreally undecided: how far one can go on the path of knowledge and power. That isan issue which is open and no one can predict its outcome. I once told you thatthe freedom a warrior has is either to act impeccably or to act like anincompoop. Impeccability is indeed the only act which is free and thus the truemeasure of a warrior's spirit.\"Don Juan said that after the apprentice had made his decision to join the worldof sorcerers, the teacher gave him a pragmatic chore; a task that he had tofulfill in his day-to-day life. He explained that the task, which is designed tofit the apprentice's personality, is usually a sort of farfetched life situationwhich the apprentice is supposed to get into as a means of permanently affectinghis view of the world.In my own case, I understood the task more as a lively joke than a serious lifesituation. As time passed, however, it finally dawned on me that I had to beearnest about it.\"After the apprentice has been given his sorcery task he's ready for anothertype of instruction,\" he proceeded. \"He is a warrior then. In your case, sinceyou were no longer an apprentice, I taught you the three techniques that helpdreaming: disrupting the routines of life, the gait of power, and not-doing. Youwere very consistent, dumb as an apprentice and dumb as a warrior. You dutifullywrote down everything I said and everything that happened to you, but you didnot act exactly as I had told you to. So I still had to blast you with powerplants.\"Don Juan then gave me a step-by-step rendition of how he had driven my attentionaway from 'dreaming', making me believe that the important problem was a verydifficult activity he had called not-doing which consisted of a perceptual gameof focusing attention on features of the world that were ordinarily overlookedsuch as the shadows of things. Don Juan said that his strategy had been to setnot-doing apart by imposing the most strict secrecy on it.\"Not-doing, like everything else, is a very important technique, but it was notthe main issue,\" he said. \"You fell for the secrecy. You, a blabbermouth, havingto keep a secret!\"He laughed and said that he could imagine the troubles I must have gone throughto keep my mouth shut.He explained that disrupting routines, the gait of power, and not-doing wereavenues for learning new ways of perceiving the world, and that they gave awarrior an inkling of incredible possibilities of action. Don Juan's idea wasthat the knowledge of a separate and pragmatic world of 'dreaming' was madepossible through the use of those three techniques.\"Dreaming is a practical aid devised by sorcerers,\" he said. \"They were notfools. They knew what they were doing and sought the usefulness of the nagual bytraining their tonal to let go for a moment, so to speak, and then grab again.This statement doesn't make sense to you. But that's what you've been doing allalong; training yourself to let go without losing your marbles. Dreaming, ofcourse, is the crown of the sorcerers' efforts; the ultimate use of the nagual\"He went through all the exercises of not-doing that he had made me perform, theroutines of my daily life that he had isolated for disrupting, and all theoccasions when he had forced me to engage in the gait of power.\"We're coming to the end of my recapitulation,\" he said. \"Now we have to talkabout Genaro.\"Don Juan said that there had been a very important omen the day I met donGenaro. I told him that I could not remember anything out of the ordinary. Hereminded me that on that day we had been sitting on a bench in a park. He saidthat he had mentioned earlier to me that he was going to wait for a friend I hadnever met before. Then when his friend appeared, I singled him out without anyhesitation in the midst of a huge crowd. That was the omen that made themrealize that don Genaro was my benefactor.I remembered when he mentioned it that as we sat talking I had turned around andseen a small lean man who radiated an extraordinary vitality, or grace, orsimple gusto. He had just turned a corner into the park. In a joking mood I tolddon Juan that his friend was approaching us, and that he was most certainly asorcerer judging by the way he looked.\"Genaro recommended what to do with you from that day on,\" don Juan proceeded.\"As your guide into the nagual he gave you impeccable demonstrations, and everytime he performed an act as a nagual you were left with a knowledge that defiedand bypassed your reason. He disassembled your view of the world although youare not aware of that yet.\"Again in this instance, you behaved just like in the case of the power plants.You needed more than was necessary. A few of the nagual's onslaughts should beenough to dismantle one's view. But even to this day, after all the nagual'sbarrages, your view seems invulnerable. Oddly enough, that's your best feature.\"All in all then, Genaro's job has been to lead you into the nagual. But here wehave a strange question. What was being led into the nagual?\"He urged me with a movement of his eyes to answer the question. \"My reason?\" Iasked.\"No, reason is meaningless there,\" he replied. \"Reason craps out in an instantwhen it is out of its safe narrow bounds.\"\"Then it was my tonal\" I said.\"No, the tonal and the nagual are the two inherent parts of ourselves,\" he saiddryly. \"They cannot be led into each other.\"\"My perception?\" I asked.\"You've got it,\" he yelled as if I were a child giving the right answer. \"We'recoming now to the sorcerers' explanation. I've warned you already that it won'texplain anything and yet...\" He paused and looked at me with shiny eyes. \"Thisis another of the sorcerers' tricks,\" he said.\"What do you mean? What's the trick?\" I asked with a touch of alarm.\"The sorcerers' explanation, of course,\" he replied. \"You'll see that foryourself. But let's continue with it. Sorcerers say that we are 'inside abubble'. It is a bubble into which we are placed at the moment of our birth. Atfirst the bubble is open, but then it begins to close until it has sealed us in.That bubble is our perception. We live inside that bubble all of our lives. Andwhat we witness on its round walls is our own reflection.\"He lowered his head and looked at me askance. He giggled.\"You're goofing,\" he said. \"You're supposed to raise a point here.\"I laughed. Somehow his warnings about the sorcerers' explanation- plus therealization of the awesome range of his awareness- had finally begun to taketheir toll on me.\"What was the point I was supposed to raise?\" I asked.\"If what we witness on the walls is our own reflection, then the thing that'sbeing reflected must be the real thing,\" he said, smiling.\"That's a good point,\" I said in a joking tone.My reason could easily follow that argument.\"The thing reflected is our view of the world,\" he said. \"That view is first adescription, which is given to us from the moment of our birth until all ourattention is caught by it and the description becomes a view.\"The teacher's task is to rearrange the view, to prepare the luminous being forthe time when the benefactor opens the bubble from the outside.\"He went into another studied pause and made another remark about my lack ofattention judged by my incapacity to make an appropriate comment or question.\"What should've been my question?\" I asked.\"Why should the bubble be opened?\" he replied. He laughed loudly and patted myback when I said, \"That's a good question.\"\"Of course!\" he exclaimed. \"It has to be a good question for you, it's one ofyour own.\"The bubble is opened in order to allow the luminous being a view of histotality,\" he went on. \"Naturally this business of calling it a bubble is only away of talking, but in this case it is an accurate way.\"The delicate maneuver of leading a luminous being into the totality of himselfrequires that the teacher work from inside the bubble and the benefactor fromoutside.\"The teacher reorders the view of the world. I have called that view the islandof the tonal. I've said that everything that we are is on that island. Thesorcerers' explanation says that the island of the tonal is made by ourperception which has been trained to focus on certain elements. Each of thoseelements and all of them together form our view of the world.\"The job of a teacher, insofar as the apprentice's perception is concerned,consists of reordering all the elements of the island on one half of the bubble.By now you must have realized that cleaning and reordering the island of thetonal means regrouping all its elements on the side of reason. My task has beento disarrange your ordinary view, not to destroy it but to force it to rally onthe side of reason. You've done that better than anyone I know.\"He drew an imaginary circle on the rock and divided it in two along a verticaldiameter. He said that the art of a teacher was to force his disciple to grouphis view of the world on the right half of the buhble.\"Why the right half?\" I asked.\"That's the side of the tonal\" he said. \"The teacher always addresses himself tothat side, and by presenting his apprentice on the one hand with the warrior'sway he forces him into reasonableness, and sobriety, and strength of characterand body.\"And by presenting him on the other hand with unthinkable but real situationswhich the apprentice cannot cope with, he forces him to realize that his reason,although it is a most wonderful affair, can only cover a small area.\"Once the warrior is confronted with his incapacity to reason everything out, hewill go out of his way to bolster and defend his defeated reason, and to thateffect he will rally everything he's got around it. The teacher sees to that byhammering him mercilessly until all his view of the world is on one half of thebubble. The other half of the bubble, the one that has been cleared, can then beclaimed by something sorcerers call will.\"We can better explain this by saying that the task of the teacher is to wipeclean one half of the bubble and to reorder every thing on the other half. Thebenefactor's task then is to open the bubble on the side that has been cleaned.Once the seal is broken, the warrior is never the same. He has then the commandof his totality.\"Half of the bubble is the ultimate center of reason; the tonal. The other halfis the ultimate center of will; the nagual. That is the order that shouldprevail. Any other arrangement is nonsensical and petty because it goes againstour nature. It robs us of our magical heritage and reduces us to nothing.\"End of Explanation.Back to Home Page IntroductionDon Juan stood up and stretched his arms and back, and walked around to loosenup his muscles. It was a bit cold by then.I asked him if we were through.\"Why, the show hasn't even started yet!\" he exclaimed and laughed. \"That wasonly the beginning.\"He looked at the sky and pointed to the west with a casual movement of his hand.\"In about an hour the nagual will be here,\" he said and smiled.He sat down again.\"We have one single issue left,\" he continued. \"Sorcerers call it the secret ofthe luminous beings, and that is the fact that we are perceivers. We men and allthe other luminous beings on earth are perceivers. That is our bubble, thebubble of perception. Our mistake is to believe that the only perception worthyof acknowledgment is what goes through our reason. Sorcerers believe that reasonis only one center and that it shouldn't take so much for granted.\"Genaro and I have taught you about the eight points that make the totality ofour bubble of perception. You know six points. Today Genaro and I will furtherclean your bubble of perception and after that you will know the two remainingpoints.\"He abruptly changed the topic and asked me to give him a detailed account of myperceptions of the day before, starting from the point where I saw don Genarositting on a rock by the road. He did not make any comments or interrupt me atall.When I had finished, I added an observation of my own. I had talked to Nestorand Pablito in the morning and they had given me accounts of their perceptions,which were similar to mine. My point was that he himself had told me that thenagual was an individual experience which only the observer can witness. The daybefore there were three observers and all of us had witnessed more or less thesame thing. The differences were expressed only in terms of how each of us feltor reacted to any specific instance of the whole phenomenon.\"What happened yesterday was a demonstration of the nagual for you, and forNestor and Pablito. I'm their benefactor. Between Genaro and myself, we canceledout the center of reason in all three of you. Genaro and I had enough power tomake you agree on what you were witnessing. Several years ago, you and I werewith a bunch of apprentices one night, but I didn't have enough power by myselfalone to make all of you witness the same thing.\"He said that, judging by what I had told him I had perceived the day before andfrom what he had 'seen' about me, his conclusion was that I was ready for thesorcerers' explanation. He added that so was Pablito, but he was uncertain aboutNestor.\"To be ready for the sorcerers' explanation is a very difficult accomplishment,\"he said. \"It shouldn't be, but we insist on indulging in our lifelong view ofthe world. In this respect you and Nestor and Pablito are alike. Nestor hidesbehind his shyness and gloom; Pablito behind his disarming charm. You hidebehind your cockiness and words. All are views that seem to be unchallengeable;and as long as you three persist in using them, your bubbles of perception havenot been cleared and the sorcerers' explanation will have no meaning.\"In a spirit of jest I said that I had been obsessed with the famous sorcerers'explanation for a very long time, but the closer I got to it the further itseemed to be. I was going to add a joking comment when he took the words rightout of my mouth.\"Wouldn't it be something if the sorcerers' explanation turns out to be a dud?\"he asked in the midst of loud laughter.He patted me on the back and seemed to be delighted, like a child anticipating apleasant event.\"Genaro is a stickler for the rule,\" he said in a confiding tone. \"There'snothing to this confounded explanation. If it would've been up to me I wouldhave given it to you years ago. Don't put too much stock in it.\"He looked up and examined the sky.\"Now you are ready,\" he said in a dramatic and solemn tone. \"It's time to go.But before we leave this place I have to tell you one last thing. The mystery-or the secret of the sorcerers' explanation is that it deals with unfolding thewings of perception.\"He put his hand over my writing pad and said that I should go to the bushes andtake care of my bodily functions, and after that I should take off my clothesand leave them in a bundle right where we were. I looked at him questioninglyand he explained that I had to be naked, but that I could keep my shoes and myhat on.I insisted on knowing why I had to be naked. Don Juan laughed and said that thereason was rather personal and had to do with my own comfort, and that I myselfhad told him that that was the way I wanted it. His explanation baffled me. Ifelt that he was playing a joke on me; or that in conformity with what he hadrevealed to me, he was simply displacing my attention. I wanted to know why hewas doing that.He began to talk about an incident that had happened to me years before while wehad been in the mountains of northern Mexico with don Genaro. On that occasionthey were explaining to me that 'reason' could not possibly account foreverything that took place in the world. In order to give me an undeniabledemonstration of it don Genaro performed a magnificent leap as a 'nagual', and'elongated' himself to reach the top of some peaks ten or fifteen miles away.Don Juan said that I missed the issue, and that as far as convincing my 'reason'was concerned, don Genaro's demonstration was a failure; but from the point ofview of my bodily reaction it was a riot.The bodily reaction that don Juan was referring to was something which was veryvivid in my mind. I saw don Genaro disappear in front of my very eyes as if awind had swished him away. His leap or whatever he had done had had such aprofound effect on me that I felt as if his movement had ripped something in myintestines. My bowels became loose and I had to throw away my pants and shirt.My discomfort and embarrassment knew no limits. I had to walk naked wearing onlya hat on a heavily trafficked highway until I got to my car. Don Juan remindedme that it was then that I had told him not to let me ruin my clothes again.After I had taken my clothes off we walked a few hundred feet to a very largerock overlooking the same ravine. He made me look down. There was a drop of overa hundred feet. He then told me to turn off my internal dialogue and listen tothe sounds around us.After a few moments I heard the sound of a pebble bouncing from rock to rock onits way down to the bottom of the ravine. I heard every single bounce of thepebble with inconceivable clarity. Then I heard another pebble being thrown, andanother one yet. I lifted my head to align my left ear to the direction of thesound and saw don Genaro sitting on top of the rock, twelve to fifteen feet fromwhere we were. He was casually tossing pebbles down into the ravine.He yelled and cackled when I saw him and he said that he had been hiding therewaiting for me to discover him. I had a moment of bafflement. Don Juan whisperedin my ear repeatedly that my 'reason' was not invited to that event, and that Ishould give up the nagging desire to control everything. He said that the'nagual' was a perception only for me, and that that was the reason Pablito hadnot seen the 'nagual' in my car.He added, as if reading my unvoiced feelings, that although the 'nagual' was forme alone to witness, it still was don Genaro himself.Don Juan took me by the arm and in a playful manner led me to where don Genarowas sitting. Don Genaro stood up and came closer to me. His body radiated a heatthat I could see, a glow which dazzled me. He came to my side and withouttouching me he put his mouth close to my left ear and began to whisper. Don Juanalso began whispering in my other ear. Their voices were synchronized. They wereboth repeating the same statements.They said that I should not be afraid, and that I had long powerful fibers,which were not there to protect me, for there was nothing to protect, or to beprotected from; but that they were there to guide my 'nagual's' perception invery much the same way my eyes guided my normal 'tonal's' perception. They toldme that my fibers were all around me, that through them I could perceiveeverything at once, and that one single fiber was enough for a leap from therock into the ravine, or up from the ravine to the rock.I had listened to everything they had whispered. Every word seemed to have had aunique connotation for me. I could retain every utterance and then play it backas if I were a tape recorder.They both urged me to leap to the bottom of the ravine. They said that I shouldfirst feel my fibers, then isolate one that went all the way down to the bottomof the ravine and follow it. As they spoke their commands I actually could matchtheir words with adequate feelings. I sensed an itching all over me, especiallya most peculiar sensation which was indiscernible in itself but approximated thesensation of a 'long itching'. My body could actually feel the bottom of theravine and I sensed that feeling as an itching in some undefined area of mybody.Don Juan and don Genaro kept on coaxing me to slide through that feeling, but Idid not know how. I then heard don Genaro's voice alone.He said that he was going to jump with me. He grabbed me, or pushed me, orembraced me, and plunged with me into the abyss. I had the ultimate sensation ofphysical anguish. It was as if my stomach was being chewed and devoured. It wasa mixture of pain and pleasure of such intensity and duration that all I coulddo was to yell and yell at the top of my lungs.When the sensation subsided I saw an inextricable cluster of sparks and darkmasses, beams of light and cloudlike formations. I could not tell whether myeyes were open or closed, or where my eyes were, or where my body was for thatmatter. Then I sensed the same physical anguish, although not as pronounced asthe first time, and next I had the impression I had woken up and I found myselfstanding on the rock with don Juan and don Genaro.Don Juan said that I had goofed again, that it was useless to leap if theperception of the leap was going to be chaotic. Both of them repeated countlesstimes in my ears that the 'nagual' by itself was of no use, that it had to betempered by the 'tonal'. They said that I had to leap willingly and be aware ofmy act.I hesitated, not so much because I was afraid but because I was reluctant. Ifelt my vacillation [* vacillation- changing location by moving back and forth.]as if my body were swinging from side to side like a pendulum. Then some strangemood overtook me and I leaped with all my corporealness. I wanted to think as Itook the plunge but I could not.I saw as if through a fog the walls of the narrow gorge and the jutting rocks atthe bottom of the ravine. I did not have a sequential perception of my descent.I had instead the sensation that I was actually on the ground at the bottom. Idistinguished every feature of the rocks in a short circle around me. I noticedthat my view was not unidirectional and stereoscopic from the level of the eyes,but flat and all around me. After a moment I panicked and something pulled me uplike a yo-yo.Don Juan and don Genaro made me perform the leap over and over. After every jumpdon Juan urged me to be less reticent [* reticent- formal in manner] andunwilling. He said, time and time again, that the sorcerers' secret in using the\"nagual\" was in our perception; that leaping was simply an exercise inperception, and that it would end only after I had succeeded in perceiving, as aperfect \"tonal', what was at the bottom of the ravine.At one moment I had an inconceivable sensation. I was fully and soberly awarethat I was standing on the edge of the rock with don Juan and don Genarowhispering in my ears, and then in the next instant I was looking at the bottomof the ravine.Everything was perfectly normal. It was almost dark by then, but there was stillenough light to make everything absolutely recognizable as in the world of myeveryday life. I was watching some bushes when I heard a sudden noise, a rockrolling down. I saw instantly a good size rock tumbling down the wall of theravine towards me. In a flash I also saw don Genaro throwing it. I had an attackof panic and an instant later I had been pulled back to the site on top of therock. I looked around. Don Genaro was not there any more.Don Juan began to laugh and said that don Genaro had left because he could notstand my stench. I then had the embarrassing realization that I was truly amess. Don Juan had been right in making me take my clothes off. He walked me toa stream nearby and washed me like a horse; scooping water with my hat andthrowing it at me while he made hilarious comments about having saved my pants. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Bubble of Perception I spent the day by myself at don Genaro's house. I slept most of the time. DonJuan came back in the late afternoon and we hiked in complete silence to anearby range of mountains. We stopped at dusk and sat on the edge of a deepgorge until it was almost dark.Then don Juan led me to another place close by; a monumental cliff with a sheervertical rock wall. The cliff was unnoticeable from the trail that led to it.Don Juan, however, had shown it to me several times before. He had made me lookover the edge and had told me that the whole cliff was a place of power,especially the base of it, which was a canyon several hundred feet down. Everytime I had looked into it I had had a discomforting chill. The canyon was alwaysdark and menacing.Before we reached the place, don Juan said that I had to go on by myself andmeet Pablito on the edge of the cliff. He recommended that I should relax andperform the gait of power in order to wash away my nervous tiredness.Don Juan stepped aside, to the left of the trail, and the darkness simplyswallowed him. I wanted to stop and examine where he had gone, but my body didnot obey. I began to jog although I was so tired that I could hardly keep on myfeet.When I reached the cliff, I could not see anyone there and I went on jogging inplace; breathing deeply. After a while I relaxed a bit. I stood motionless withmy back against a rock, and I noticed then the shape of a man a few feet awayfrom me. He was sitting, hiding his head in his arms. I had a moment of intensefright and recoiled, but then I explained to myself that the man must bePablito, and without any hesitation I advanced towards him. I called Pablito'sname out loud. I figured that he must have been uncertain of who I was and hadbecome so scared that he had covered his head not to look. But before I reachedhim some inexplicable fear took possession of me. My body froze on the spot withmy right arm already extended to touch him. The man lifted his head up. It wasnot Pablito! His eyes were two enormous mirrors, like a tiger's eyes.My body jumped backwards. My muscles tensed and then released the tensionwithout the slightest influence of my volition; and I performed a backward leap,so fast and so far that under normal conditions I would have plunged into agrandiose speculation about it. As it was, however, my fright was so out ofproportion that I had no inclination for pondering, and I would have run out ofthere had it not been that someone held my arm forcibly. The feeling thatsomeone was holding me by the arm threw me into total panic and I screamed. Myoutburst, instead of being the shriek I thought it should have been, was a longchilling yell.I turned to face my assailant. It was Pablito, who was shaking even more thanme. My nervousness was at its peak. I could not talk, my teeth chattered, andripples went through my back making me jerk involuntarily. I had to breathethrough my mouth.Pablito said, between chatters, that the 'nagual' had been waiting for him; thathe had barely gotten out of its clutches when he bumped into me; and that I hadnearly killed him with my yell. I wanted to laugh and made the most weird soundsimaginable.When I regained my calmness I told Pablito that apparently the same thing hadhappened to me. The end result in my case had been that my fatigue had vanished.I felt instead an uncontainable surge of strength and well-being. Pablito seemedto be experiencing the same sensations. We began to giggle in a nervous sillyway.I heard the sound of soft and careful steps in the distance. I detected thesound before Pablito. He appeared to react to my stiffening. I had the certaintythat someone was approaching the place where we were. We turned in the directionof the sound.A moment later the silhouettes of don Juan and don Genaro became visible. Theywere walking calmly and stopped four or five feet away from us. Don Juan wasfacing me and don Genaro faced Pablito. I wanted to tell don Juan that somethinghad scared me nearly out of my wits, but Pablito squeezed my arm. I knew what hemeant. There was something strange about don Juan and don Genaro. As I looked atthem my eyes began to get out of focus.Don Genaro gave a sharp command. I did not understand what he had said, but I'knew' he had meant that we should not cross our eyes.\"The darkness has settled on the world,\" don Juan said, looking at the sky.Don Genaro drew a half-moon on the hard ground. For a moment it seemed to methat he had used some iridescent chalk, but then I realized that he was notholding anything in his hands. I was perceiving the imaginary half-moon that hehad drawn with his finger. He made Pablito and me sit on the inner curve of theconvex edge, while he and don Juan sat cross-legged on the extreme ends of thehalf-moon, six or seven feet away from us.Don Juan spoke first. He said that they were going to show us their allies. Hetold us that if we would gaze at their left sides, between their hips and theirrib bones, we would 'see' something like a rag or a handkerchief hanging fromtheir belts.Don Genaro added that next to the rags on their belts there were two roundbuttonlike things, and that we should gaze at their belts until we 'saw' therags and the buttons.Before don Genaro had spoken I had already noticed some flat item like a pieceof cloth, and one round pebble that hung from each of their belts. Don Juan'sallies were darker and more menacing than don Genaro's. My reaction was amixture of curiosity and fear. My reactions were experienced in my stomach and Iwas not judging anything in a rational manner.Don Juan and don Genaro reached for their belts and seemed to unhook the darkpieces of cloth. They took them with their left hands. Don Juan flung his in theair above his head, but don Genaro let his drop to the ground gently.The pieces of cloth stretched as if the hurling and the dropping had made themspread like perfectly smooth handkerchiefs. They descended slowly, bobbing likekites. The movement of don Juan's ally was the exact replica of what I hadperceived him doing when he had whirled around days before.As the pieces of cloth got closer to the ground, they became solid, round andmassive. They first curled as though they had fallen over a door knob, then theyexpanded. Don Juan's grew into a voluminous shadow. It took the lead and movedtowards us, crushing small rocks and hard lumps of dirt. It came within four orfive feet of us to the very dip of the half-moon, between don Juan and donGenaro.At one moment I thought it was going to roll over us and pulverize us. My terrorat that instant was like a burning fire. The shadow in front of me was gigantic,perhaps fourteen feet high and six feet across. It moved as if it were feelingits way around with no eyes. It jerked and wobbled. I knew that it was lookingfor me.Pablito at that moment hid his head against my chest. The sensation that hismovement produced in me dispelled some of the awesome attention that I hadfocused on the shadow. The shadow seemed to become disassociated, judging by itserratic jerks, and then it moved out of sight, merging with the darkness around.I shook Pablito. He lifted his head and let out a muffled scream. I looked up. Astrange man was staring at me. He seemed to have been right behind the shadow,perhaps hiding behind it. He was rather tall and lanky, he had a long face, nohair, and the left side of his head was covered by a rash or an eczema of somesort. His eyes were wild and shiny. His mouth was half open. He wore somestrange pajama-like clothing. His pants were too short for him. I could notdistinguish whether or not he had shoes on.He stood looking at us for what seemed to be a long time as if waiting for anopening in order to lurch at us and tear us apart. There was so much intensityin his eyes. It was not hatred or violence but some sort of animal feeling ofdistrust. I could not stand the tension any longer. I wanted to adapt a fightingposition that don Juan had taught me years before and I would have done so hadit not been for Pablito, who whispered that the ally could not go over the linethat don Genaro had drawn on the ground. I realized then that there was indeed abright line that seemed to detain whatever was in front of us.After a moment the man moved away to the left, just like the shadow before. Ihad the sensation that don Juan and don Genaro had called them both back.There was a short quiet pause. I could not see don Juan or don Genaro any more.They were no longer sitting on the points of the half-moon. Suddenly I heard thesound of two small pebbles hitting the solid rock floor where we were sitting,and in a flash the area in front of us lit up as if a mellow yellowish light hadbeen turned on.In front of us there was a ravenous beast, a giant nauseating-looking coyote orwolf. Its whole body was covered with a white secretion like perspiration orsaliva. Its hair was raggedy and wet. Its eyes were wild. It growled with ablind fury that sent chills through me. Its jaw shivered and globs of salivaflew all over the place. It pawed the ground like a mad dog trying to get loosefrom a chain. Then it stood on its hind legs and moved its front paws and itsjaws rabidly. All its fury seemed to be concentrated on breaking some barrier infront of us.I became aware that my fear of that crazed animal was of a different sort thanthe fear of the two apparitions I had witnessed before. My dread of that beastwas a physical revulsion and horror. I looked on in utter impotence at its rage.Suddenly it seemed to lose its wildness and trotted out of sight.I heard then something else coming towards us, or perhaps I sensed it. All of asudden the shape of a colossal feline loomed in front of us. I first saw itseyes in the darkness. They were huge and fixed like two pools of waterreflecting light. It snorted and growled softly. It exhaled air and moved backand forth in front of us without taking its eyes away from us. It did not havethe electric glow that the coyote had. I could not distinguish its featuresclearly, and yet its presence was infinitely more ominous than the otherbeast's. It seemed to be gathering strength. I felt that it was so daring thatit would go beyond its limits.Pablito must have had a similar feeling, for he whispered that I should duck myhead and lie almost flat against the ground. A second later the feline charged.It ran towards us and then it leaped with its paws extended forward. I closed myeyes and hid my head in my arms against the ground. I felt that the beast hadripped the protective line that don Genaro had drawn around us and was actuallyon top of us. I felt its weight pinning me down. The fur on its belly rubbedagainst my neck. It seemed that its forelegs were caught in something. Itwriggled to set itself free. I felt its jerking and prodding and heard itsdiabolic puffing and hissing.I knew then that I was lost. I had a vague sense of a rational choice and Iwanted to resign myself calmly to my fate of dying there, but I was afraid ofthe physical pain of dying under such awful circumstances.Then some strange force surged from my body. It was as if my body refused to dieand pooled all its strength in one single point, my left arm and hand. I felt anindomitable surge coming through it. Something uncontrollable was takingpossession of my body; something that forced me to push the massive malignantweight of that beast off of us. Pablito seemed to have reacted in the samefashion and we both stood up at once. There was so much energy created by bothof us that the beast was flung like a rag doll.The exertion had been supreme. I collapsed on the ground, panting for air. Themuscles of my stomach were so tense that I could not breathe. I did not pay anyattention to what Pablito was doing.I finally noticed that don Juan and don Genaro were helping me to sit up. I sawPablito spread on the ground face down with his arms outstretched. He seemed tohave fainted. After they had made me sit up, don Juan and don Genaro helpedPablito. Both of them rubbed his stomach and back. They made him stand up andafter a while he could sit up by himself again.Don Juan and don Genaro sat on the ends of the half-moon, and then they began tomove in front of us as if a rail existed between the two points, a rail thatthey were using to shift their positions back and forth from one side to theother. Their movements made me dizzy.They finally stopped next to Pablito and began to whisper in his ear. After amoment they stood up, all three of them at once, and walked to the edge of thecliff. Don Genaro lifted Pablito as if he were a child. Pablito's body was stifflike a board. Don Juan held Pablito by the ankles. He whirled him around,seemingly to gain momentum and force, and finally he let go of his legs andhurled his body out over the abyss away from the edge of the cliff.I saw Pablito's body against the dark western sky. It described circles, justlike don Juan's body had done days before. The circles were slow. Pablito seemedto be gaining altitude instead of falling down. Then the circling becameaccelerated. Pablito's body twirled like a disk for a moment and then itdisintegrated. I perceived that it had vanished in thin air.Don Juan and don Genaro came to my side, squatted by me and proceeded to whisperin my ears. Each said something different, yet I had no trouble in followingtheir commands. It was as if I became 'split' the instant they uttered theirfirst words. I felt that they were doing with me what they had done withPablito.Don Genaro made me whirl and then I had the thoroughly conscious sensation ofspinning or floating for a moment. Next I was rushing through the air;plummeting down to the ground at a tremendous speed.I felt, as I was falling, that my clothes were ripping off, then my flesh felloff, and finally only my head remained. I had the very clear sensation that asmy body became dismembered I lost my superfluous weight, and thus my fallinglost its momentum and my speed decreased.My descent was no longer a vertigo. I began to move back and forth like a leaf.Then my head was stripped of its weight and all that was left of 'me' was asquare centimeter, a nugget, a tiny pebblelike residue.All my feeling was concentrated there. Then the nugget seemed to burst and I wasa thousand pieces. I knew, or something somewhere knew, that I was aware of thethousand pieces at once. I was the awareness itself.Then some part of that awareness began to be stirred. It rose; grew. It becamelocalized, and little by little I regained the sense of boundaries,consciousness, or whatever, and suddenly the 'me' I knew and was familiar witherupted into the most spectacular view of all the imaginable combinations of'beautiful' scenes. It was as if I were looking at thousands of pictures: of theworld, of people, of things.The scenes then became blurry. I had the sensation that they were being passedin front of my eyes at a greater speed until I could not single out any of themfor examination. Finally it was as if I were witnessing the organization of theworld rolling past my eyes in an unbroken, endless chain.I suddenly found myself standing on the cliff with don Juan and don Genaro. Theywhispered that they had pulled me back, and that I had witnessed the unknownthat no one can talk about. They said that they were going to hurl me into itonce more, and that I should let the wings of my perception unfold and touch the'tonal' and the 'nagual' at once without being aware of going back and forthfrom one to the other.I again had the sensations of being tossed, spinning, and falling down at atremendous speed. Then I exploded. I disintegrated. Something in me gave out. Itreleased something I had kept locked up all my life.I was thoroughly aware then that my secret reservoir had been tapped and that itpoured out unrestrainedly. There was no longer the sweet unity I call 'me'.There was nothing and yet that nothing was filled. It was not light or darkness,hot or cold, pleasant or unpleasant. It was not that I moved or floated or wasstationary. Neither was I a single unit nor a 'self' as I am accustomed tobeing.I was a myriad of selves which were all 'me'; a colony of separate units thathad a special allegiance to one another and would join unavoidably to form onesingle awareness- my human awareness.It was not that I 'knew' beyond the shadow of a doubt because there was nothingI could have 'known' with, but all my single awarenesses 'knew' that the 'I',the 'me', of my familiar world was a colony; a conglomerate of separate andindependent feelings that had an unbending solidarity to one another. Theunbending solidarity of my countless awarenesses, and the allegiance that thoseparts had for one another was my life force.A way of describing that unified sensation would be to say that those nuggets ofawareness were scattered. Each of them was aware of itself and none was morepredominant than the other.Then something would stir them, and they would join and emerge onto an areawhere all of them had to be pooled in one clump; the 'me' I know.As the 'me myself' then, I would witness a coherent scene of worldly activity;or a scene that pertained to other worlds and which I thought must have beenpure imagination; or a scene that pertained to 'pure thinking'- that is, I hadviews of intellectual systems, or of ideas strung together as verbalizations.In some scenes I talked to myself to my heart's content. After every one ofthose coherent views the 'me' would disintegrate and be nothing once more.During one of those excursions into a coherent view I found myself on the cliffwith don Juan. I instantly realized that I was then the total 'me' I am familiarwith. I felt my physicality as real. I was in the world rather than merelyviewing it.Don Juan hugged me like a child. He looked at me. His face was very close. Icould see his eyes in the darkness. They were kind. They seemed to hold aquestion. I knew what it was. The unspeakable was truly unspeakable.\"Well?\" he asked softly, as if he would need my reaffirmation.I was speechless. The words \"numb,\" \"bewildered,\" \"confused,\" and so on were notin any way appropriate descriptions of my feelings at that moment. I was notsolid. I knew that don Juan had to grab me and keep me forcibly on the ground,otherwise I would have floated in the air and disappeared. I was not afraid ofvanishing. I longed for the 'unknown' where my awareness was not unified.Don Juan, pushing down on both of my shoulders, walked me slowly to an areaaround don Genaro's house. He made me lie down and then covered me with softdirt from a pile that he seemed to have prepared beforehand. He covered me up tomy neck. With leaves he made a sort of pillow for my head to rest on, and toldme not to move or fall asleep at all. He said that he was going to sit and keepme company until the earth had again consolidated my form.I felt very comfortable and had a nearly invincible desire to fall asleep, butdon Juan would not let me. He demanded that I should talk about anything underthe sun except what I had just experienced. I did not know what to talk about atfirst, then I asked about don Genaro. Don Juan said that don Genaro had takenPablito, and had buried him somewhere around there and was doing with him whathe himself was doing with me.I had the desire to sustain the conversation but something in me was incomplete.I had an unusual indifference; a tiredness that was more like boredom. Don Juanseemed to know how I felt. He began to talk about Pablito, and about how hisfate and my fate were interlocked.He said that he became Pablito's benefactor at the same time that don Genarobecame his teacher, and that power had paired Pablito and me step by step. Hemade the emphatic remark that the only difference between Pablito and me wasthat while Pablito's world as a warrior was governed by coercion and fear, minewas governed by affection and freedom.Don Juan explained that such a difference was due to the intrinsically differentpersonalities of the benefactors. Don Genaro was sweet, affectionate and funny;while he himself was dry, authoritarian and direct. He said that my personalitydemanded a strong teacher but a tender benefactor, and that Pablito was theopposite. He needed a kind teacher and a stern benefactor.We talked for a while longer and then it was morning. When the sun appeared overthe mountains on the eastern horizon, he helped me to get up from under thedirt. After I woke up in the early afternoon, don Juan and I sat by the door of donGenaro's house. Don Juan said that don Genaro was still with Pablito, preparinghim for the last encounter.\"Tomorrow you and Pablito will go into the unknown,\" he said. \"I must prepareyou for it now. You will go into it by yourselves. Last night you two were likeyo-yos being pulled back and forth. Tomorrow you will be on your own.\"I had then a rush of curiosity, and questions about my experiences of the nightbefore just poured out of me. He was unruffled by my barrage.\"Today I have to accomplish a most crucial maneuver,\" he said. \"I have to trickyou for the last time. And you must fall for my tricking.\"He laughed and slapped his thighs.\"What Genaro wanted to show you with the first exercise the other night was howsorcerers use the nagual,\" he went on. \"There's no way to get to the sorcerers'explanation unless one has willingly used the nagual, or rather, unless one haswillingly used the tonal to make sense out of one's actions in the nagual.Another way of making all this clear is to say that the view of the tonal mustprevail if one is going to use the nagual the way sorcerers do.\"I told him that I had found a blatant incongruity in what he had just said. Onthe one hand, he had given me two days before, an incredible recapitulation ofhis studied acts over a period of years- acts designed to affect my view of theworld; and on the other hand, he wanted that same view to prevail.\"One thing has nothing to do with the other,\" he said. \"Order in our perceptionis the exclusive realm of the tonal. Only there can our actions have a sequence.Only there are they like stairways where one can count the steps. There isnothing of that sort in the nagual. Therefore, the view of the tonal is a tool,and as such it is not only the best tool but the only one we've got.\"Last night your bubble of perception opened and its wings unfolded. There isnothing else to say about it. It is impossible to explain what happened to you,so I'm not going to attempt to and you shouldn't try to either. It should beenough to say that the wings of your perception were made to touch yourtotality. Last night you went back and forth from the nagual to the tonal timeand time again. You were hurled in twice so as to leave no possibility formistakes.\"The second time you experienced the full impact of the journey into theunknown, and your perception unfolded its wings when something in you realizedyour true nature. You are a cluster.\"This is the sorcerers' explanation. The nagual is the unspeakable. All thepossible feelings and beings and selves float in it like barges, peaceful,unaltered, forever. Then the glue of life binds some of them together.\"You yourself found that out last night, and so did Pablito, and so did Genarothe time he journeyed into the unknown, and so did I. When the glue of lifebinds those feelings together a being is created; a being that loses the senseof its true nature and becomes blinded by the glare and clamor of the area wherebeings hover; the tonal.\"The tonal is where all the unified organization exists. A being pops into thetonal once the force of life has bound all the needed feelings together. I saidto you once that the tonal begins at birth and ends at death.\"I said that because I know that as soon as the force of life leaves the body,all those single awarenesses disintegrate and go back again to where they camefrom; the nagual. What a warrior does in journeying into the unknown is verymuch like dying, except that his cluster of single feelings do not disintegratebut expand a bit without losing their togetherness. At death, however, they sinkdeeply and move independently as if they had never been a unit.\"I wanted to tell him how completely homogeneous were his statements with myexperience. But he did not let me talk.\"There is no way to refer to the unknown,\" he said. \"One can only witness it.The sorcerers' explanation says that each of us has a center from which thenagual can be witnessed, the will. Thus, a warrior can venture into the nagualand let his cluster arrange and rearrange itself in any way possible.\"I've said to you that the expression of the nagual is a personal matter. Imeant that it is up to the individual warrior himself to direct the arrangementand rearrangements of that cluster. The human form, or human feeling is theoriginal one. Perhaps it is the sweetest form of them all to us. There are,however, an endless number of alternative forms which the cluster may adopt.\"I've said to you that a sorcerer can adopt any form he wants. That is true. Asorcerer who is in possession of the totality of himself can direct the parts ofhis cluster to join in any conceivable way. The force of life is what makes allthat shuffling possible. Once the force of life is exhausted, there is no way toreassemble that cluster.\"I have called that cluster the bubble of perception. I have also said that itis sealed, closed tightly, and that it never opens until the moment of ourdeath. Yet it could be made to open. Sorcerers have obviously learned thatsecret, and although not all of them arrive at the totality of themselves, theyknow about the possibility of it. They know that the bubble opens only when oneplunges into the nagual. Yesterday I gave you a recapitulation of all the stepsthat you have followed to arrive at that point.\"He scrutinized me as if he were waiting for a comment or a question. What he hadsaid was beyond comment. I understood then that it would have been of noconsequence if he had told me everything fourteen years before, or if he wouldhave told it to me at any other point during my apprenticeship. What wasimportant was the fact that I had experienced with my body, or in my body, thepremises of his explanation.\"I'm waiting for your usual question,\" he said, voicing his words slowly.\"What question?\" I asked.\"The one your reason is itching to voice.\"\"Today I relinquish all questions. I really don't have any, don Juan.\"\"That's not fair,\" he said, laughing. \"There is one particular question that Ineed you to ask.\"He said that if I would shut off my internal dialogue for just an instant, Icould discern what the question was. I had a sudden thought- a momentaryinsight- and I knew what he wanted.\"Where was my body while all that was happening to me, don Juan?\" I asked and hebroke into a belly laugh.\"This is the last of the sorcerers' tricks,\" he said. \"Let's say that what I'mgoing to reveal to you is the last bit of the sorcerers' explanation. Up to thispoint your reason has haphazardly followed my doings. Your reason is willing toadmit that the world is not as the description portrays it; that there is muchmore to it than what meets the eye.\"Your reason is almost willing and ready to admit that your perception went upand down that cliff, or that something in you, or even all of you, leaped to thebottom of the gorge and examined with the eyes of the tonal what was there, asif you had descended bodily with a rope and ladder.\"That act of examining the bottom of the gorge was the crown of all these yearsof training. You did it well. Genaro saw the cubic centimeter of chance when hethrew a rock at the you that was at the bottom of the ravine. You saweverything, Genaro and I knew then without a doubt that you were ready to behurled into the unknown. At that instant you not only saw, but you knew allabout the double, the other.\"I interrupted and told him that he was giving me undeserving credit forsomething that was beyond my understanding. His reply was that I needed time tolet all those impressions settle down. And that once I had done that, answerswould just pour out of me in the same manner that questions had poured out of mein the past.\"The secret of the double is in the bubble of perception, which in your casethat night was at the top of the cliff and at the bottom of the gorge at thesame time,\" he said. \"The cluster of feelings can be made to assemble instantlyanywhere. In other words, one can perceive the here and the there at once.\"He urged me to think and remember a sequence of actions which he said were soordinary that I had almost forgotten them.I did not know what he was talking about. He coaxed me to try harder.\"Think about your hat,\" he said. \"And think what Genaro did with it.\"I had a shocking moment of realization. I had forgotten that don Genaro hadactually wanted me to take off my hat because it kept on falling off, blown bythe wind. But I did not want to let go of it. I had felt stupid being naked.Wearing a hat, which I ordinarily never do, gave me a sense of strangeness. Iwas not really myself, in which case being without clothes was not soembarrassing. Don Genaro had then attempted to change hats with me, but his wastoo small for my head. He made jokes about the size of my head and theproportions of my body, and finally he took my hat off and wrapped my head withan old poncho, like a turban.I told don Juan that I had forgotten about that sequence, which I was sure hadhappened in between my so-called leaps. And yet the memory of those 'leaps'stood as a unit which was uninterrupted.\"They certainly were an uninterrupted unit, and so was Genaro's cavorting withyour hat,\" he said. \"Those two memories cannot be made to go one after the otherbecause they happened at the same time.\"He made the fingers of his left hand move as if they could not fit into thespaces between the fingers of his right hand.\"Those leaps were only the beginning,\" he went on. \"Then came your trueexcursion into the unknown. Last night you experienced the unspeakable, thenagual.\"Your reason cannot fight the physical knowledge that you are a nameless clusterof feelings. Your reason at this point might even admit that there is anothercenter of assemblage, the will, through which it is possible to judge or assessand use the extraordinary effects of the nagual. It has finally dawned on yourreason that one can reflect the nagual through the will, although one can neverexplain it.\"But then comes your question, 'Where was I when all that was taking place?Where was my body?' The conviction that there is a real you is a result of thefact that you have rallied everything you've got around your reason. At thispoint your reason admits that the nagual is the indescribable, not because theevidence has convinced it, but because it is safe to admit that. Your reason ison safe ground, all the elements of the tonal are on its side.\"Don Juan paused and examined me. His smile was kind.\"Let's go to Genaro's place of predilection,\" he said abruptly.He stood up and we walked to the rock where we had talked two days before. Wesat comfortably on the same spots with our backs against the rock.\"To make reason feel safe is always the task of the teacher,\" he said. \"I'vetricked your reason into believing that the tonal was accountable andpredictable. Genaro and I have labored to give you the impression that only thenagual was beyond the scope of explanation. The proof that the tricking wassuccessful is that at this moment it seems to you, that in spite of everythingyou have gone through, there is still a core that you can claim as your own;your reason.\"That's a mirage. Your precious reason is only a center of assemblage; a mirrorthat reflects something which is outside of it. Last night you witnessed notonly the indescribable nagual, but also the indescribable tonal.\"The last piece of the sorcerers' explanation says that reason is merelyreflecting an outside order, and that reason knows nothing about that outsideorder. Reason cannot explain the outside order in the same way reason cannotexplain the nagual.\"Reason can only witness the effects of the tonal, but never ever could reasonunderstand the tonal, or unravel it.\"The very fact that we are thinking and talking points out an outside order thatwe follow without ever knowing how we think and talk; and without ever knowingwhat the outside order is.\"I brought up then the idea of Western man's research into the workings of thebrain as a possibility of explaining what that order was. He pointed out thatall that that research did was to attest that something was happening.\"Sorcerers do the same thing with their will,\" he said. \"They say that throughthe will they can witness the effects of the nagual. I can add now that throughreason, no matter what we do with it, or how we do it, we are merely witnessingthe effects of the tonal. In both cases there is no hope, ever, to understand orto explain what it is that we are witnessing.\"Last night was the first time that you flew on the wings of your perception.You were still very timid. You ventured only on the band of human perception. Asorcerer can use those wings to touch other sensibilities: a crow's forinstance, a coyote's, a cricket's, or the order of other worlds in that infinitespace.\"\"Do you mean other planets, don Juan?\"\"Certainly. The wings of perception can take us to the most recondite confinesof the nagual or to inconceivable worlds of the tonal.\"\"Can a sorcerer go to the moon, for instance?\"\"Of course he can,\" he replied. \"But he wouldn't be able to bring back a bag ofrocks, though.\"We laughed and joked about it but his statement had been made in ultimateseriousness.\"We have arrived at the last part of the sorcerers' explanation,\" he said. \"Lastnight Genaro and I showed you the last two points that make the totality of man;the nagual and the tonal. I once told you that those two points were outside ofoneself and yet they were not. That is the paradox of the luminous beings.\"The tonal of every one of us is but a reflection of that indescribable unknownfilled with order. The nagual of every one of us is but a reflection of thatindescribable void that contains everything.\"Now you should sit on Genaro's place of predilection until twilight. By thenyou should have pounded the sorcerers' explanation into place. As you sit herenow, you have nothing except the force of your life that binds that cluster offeelings.\"He stood up.\"Tomorrow's task is to plunge into the unknown by yourself while Genaro and Iwatch you without intervening,\" he said. \"Sit here and turn off your internaldialogue. You may gather the power needed to unfold the wings of your perceptionand fly to that infinitude.\" ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"The Predilection of Two Warriors Don Juan woke me up at the crack of dawn. He handed me a carrying gourd filledwith water and a bag of dry meat. We walked in silence for a couple of miles tothe place where I had left my car two days before.\"This journey is our last journey together,\" he said in a quiet voice when wearrived at my car.I felt a strong jolt in my stomach. I knew what he meant.He leaned against the back fender as I opened the passenger door and he lookedat me with a feeling that had never been there before. We got in the car, butbefore I started the motor, he made some obscure remarks that I also understoodto perfection. He said that we had a few minutes to sit in the car and touchagain upon some feelings very personal and poignant.I sat quietly but my spirit was restless. I wanted to say something to him;something that would have essentially soothed me. I searched in vain for theappropriate words; the formula that would have expressed the thing I 'knew'without being told.Don Juan talked about a little boy that I once knew; and about how my feelingsfor him would not change with the years or the distance.Don Juan said that he was certain that every time I thought of that little boy,my spirit jumped joyfully; and that without a trace of selfishness or pettiness,I wished him the best.He had reminded me of a story that I had once told him about the little boy; astory which he had liked and had found to have a profound meaning. During one ofour hikes in the mountains around Los Angeles, the little boy had gotten tiredof walking so I had let him ride on my shoulders. A wave of intense happinessengulfed us then and the little boy shouted his thanks to the sun and to themountains.\"That was his way of saying good-by to you,\" don Juan said.I felt the sting of anguish in my throat.\"There are many ways of saying farewell,\" he said. \"The best way is perhaps byholding a particular memory of joyfulness. For instance, if you live like awarrior, the warmth you felt when the little boy rode on your shoulders will befresh and cutting for as long as you live. That is a warrior's way of sayingfarewell.\"I hurriedly turned on the motor and drove faster than usual on the hard-packedrocky ground until we got onto the unpaved road.We drove a short distance and then we walked the rest of the way. After about anhour we came to a grove of trees. Don Genaro, Pablito, and Nestor were therewaiting for us. I greeted them. All of them appeared to be so happy andvigorous. As I looked at them and at don Juan, I was overcome by a feeling ofprofound empathy for all of them.Don Genaro embraced me and patted me affectionately on the back. He told Nestorand Pablito that I had had a fine performance leaping into the bottom of aravine. With his hand still on my shoulder he addressed them in a loud voice.\"Yes sir,\" he said, looking at them. \"I'm his benefactor and I know that thatwas quite an achievement. That was the crown of years of living like a warrior.\"He turned to me and placed his other hand on my shoulder. His eyes were shinyand peaceful.\"There's nothing I can say to you, Carlitos,\" he said, voicing his words slowly.\"Except that you had an extraordinary amount of excrement in your bowels.\"With that he and don Juan howled with laughter until they seemed about to passout. Pablito and Nestor giggled nervously, not knowing exactly what to do.When don Juan and don Genaro had quieted down, Pablito said to me that he wasunsure of his capability of going into the 'unknown' by himself.\"I really don't have the faintest idea of how to do it,\" he said. \"Genaro saysthat one needs nothing except impeccability. What do you think?\"I told him that I knew even less than he did. Nestor sighed and seemed trulyconcerned. He moved his hands and his mouth nervously as if he were on the vergeof saying something important and did not know how.\"Genaro says that you two will make it,\" he finally said.Don Genaro signaled with his hand that we were leaving. He and don Juan walkedtogether, a few yards ahead of us. We followed the same mountain trail nearlyall day. We walked in complete silence and never stopped. All of us had aprovision of dry meat and a gourd of water, and it was understood that we wouldeat as we walked. At a certain point the trail definitely became a road. Itcurved around the side of a mountain and suddenly the view of a valley opened upin front of us.It was a breath-taking sight; a long green valley glimmering in sunlight. Therewere two magnificent rainbows over it and patches of rain all over thesurrounding hills.Don Juan stopped walking and jutted his chin to point out something down in thevalley to don Genaro. Don Genaro shook his head. It was not an affirmative ornegative gesture; it was more like a jerk of his head. They both stoodmotionless peering into the valley for a long time.We left the road there and took what seemed to be a short cut. We began todescend via a more narrow and hazardous path that led to the northern part ofthe valley.When we reached the flatland, it was midafternoon. The strong scent of riverwillows and moist dirt enveloped me. For a moment the rain was like a soft greenrumble on the nearby trees to my left: then it was only a quivering in thereeds. I heard the rustling of a stream. I stopped for a moment to listen. Ilooked at the top of the trees. The high cirrus clouds on the western horizonlooked like puffs of cotton scattered in the sky. I stood there watching theclouds long enough for everyone else to get quite a bit ahead of me. I ran afterthem.Don Juan and don Genaro stopped and turned around in unison. Their eyes movedand focused on me with such uniformity and precision that they seemed to be onesingle person. It was a brief stupendous glance that sent chills through myback. Then don Genaro laughed and said that I ran thumping, like a three hundredpound flat-footed Mexican.\"Why a Mexican?\" don Juan asked.\"A flat-footed three hundred pound Indian doesn't run,\" don Genaro said in anexplanatory tone.\"Oh,\" don Juan said as if don Genaro had really explained something.We crossed the narrow lush green valley and climbed into the mountains to theeast. By late afternoon we finally came to a halt on top of a flat barren mesathat overlooked a high valley towards the south. The vegetation had changeddrastically. There were round eroded mountains all around. The land in thevalley and on the sides of the hills was parceled and cultivated and yet theentire scene gave me the feeling of barrenness.The sun was already low on the southwest horizon. Don Juan and don Genaro calledus to the northern edge of the mesa. From that point the view was sublime. [*sublime- awe inspiring] There were endless valleys and mountains towards thenorth and a range of high sierras towards the west. The sunlight reflecting onthe distant northern mountains made them look orange, like the color of thebanks of clouds over the west. The scenery, in spite of its beauty, was sad andlonely.Don Juan handed me my writing pad, but I did not feel like taking notes. We satin a half circle with don Juan and don Genaro at the ends.\"You started on the path of knowledge writing, and you will finish the sameway,\" don Juan said.All of them urged me to write, as if my writing were essential.\"You're at the very edge, Carlitos,\" don Genaro said suddenly. \"You and Pablitoboth.\"His voice was soft. Without his joking tone, he sounded kind and worried.\"Other warriors journeying into the unknown have stood on this very spot,\" hewent on. \"They all wish you two very well.\"I felt a ripple around me as if the air had been half solid and something hadcreated a wave that rippled through it.\"All of us here wish you two well,\" he said.Nestor embraced Pablito and me and then he sat apart from us.\"We still have some time,\" don Genaro said, looking at the sky. And then turningto Nestor, he asked, \"What should we do in the meantime?\"\"We should laugh and enjoy ourselves,\" Nestor answered briskly.I told don Juan that I was afraid of what was waiting for me, and that I hadmost certainly been tricked into all that; I who had not even imagined thatsituations like the one Pablito and I were living existed. I said that somethingtruly awesome had taken possession of me and little by little had pushed meuntil I was facing something perhaps worse than death.\"You're complaining,\" don Juan said dryly. \"You're feeling sorry for yourself tothe last minute.\"They all laughed. He was right. What an invincible urge! And I thought I hadvanquished it from my life. I begged all of them to forgive my idiocy.\"Don't apologize,\" don Juan said to me. \"Apologies are nonsense. What reallymatters is being an impeccable warrior in this unique place of power. This placehas harbored the finest warriors. Be as fine as they were.\"Then he addressed both Pablito and me.\"You already know that this is the last task in which we will be together,\" hesaid. \"You will enter into the nagual and the tonal by the force of yourpersonal power alone. Genaro and I are here only to bid you farewell. Power hasdetermined that Nestor should be a witness. So be it.\"This will also be the last crossroad of yours which Genaro and I will attend.Once you have entered the unknown by yourselves you cannot depend on us to bringyou back, so a decision is mandatory. You must decide whether or not to return.We are confident that you two have the strength to return if you choose to doso. The other night you were perfectly capable, in unison or separately, tothrow off the ally that otherwise would have crushed you to death. That was atest of your strength.\"I must also add that few warriors survive the encounter with the unknown thatyou are about to have; not so much because it is hard, but because the nagual isenticing beyond any statement, and warriors who are journeying into it find thatto return to the tonal, or to the world of order and noise and pain, is a mostunappealing affair.\"The decision to stay or to return is done by something in us which is neitherour reason nor our desire, but our will. So there is no way of knowing theoutcome of it beforehand.\"If you choose not to return, you will disappear as if the earth had swallowedyou. But if you choose to return to this earth, you must wait like true warriorsuntil your particular tasks are finished. Once they are finished, either insuccess or defeat, you will have the command over the totality of yourselves.\"Don Juan paused for a moment. Don Genaro looked at me and winked.\"Carlitos wants to know what it means to have command over the totality ofoneself,\" he said, and everybody laughed.He was right. Under other circumstances I would have asked about it. Thesituation, however, was too solemn for questions.\"It means that the warrior has finally encountered power,\" don Juan said. \"Noone can tell what each warrior would do with it. Perhaps you two will roampeacefully and unnoticed on the face of the earth, or perhaps you will turn outto be hateful men, or perhaps notorious, or kind. All that depends on theimpeccability and the freedom of your spirit.\"The important thing, however, is your task. That is the bestowal made by ateacher and a benefactor to their apprentices. I pray that you two will succeedin bringing your tasks to a culmination.\" [* culmination- a final climacticstage]\"Waiting to fulfill that task is a very special waiting,\" don Genaro said all ofa sudden. \"And I'm going to tell you the story of a band of warriors who livedin another time on the mountains somewhere in that direction.\"He casually pointed to the east, but then, after a moment's hesitation, heseemed to change his mind and stood up and pointed to the distant northernmountains.\"No. They lived in that direction,\" he said, looking at me and smiling with anair of erudition. [* erudition- profound scholarly knowledge] \"Exactly onehundred and thirty-five kilometers from here.\"Don Genaro was perhaps imitating me. His mouth and forehead were contracted, hishands were tightly clasped against his chest holding some imaginary object thathe may have intended to be a notebook. He maintained a most ridiculous posture.I had once met a German scholar, a Sinologist, [* Sinologist- a student ofChinese history, language and culture] who looked exactly like that. The thoughtthat all along I might have been unconsciously imitating the grimaces of aGerman Sinologist was utterly funny to me. I laughed by myself. It seemed to bea joke just for me.Don Genaro sat down again and proceeded with his story.\"Whenever a member of that band of warriors was thought to have committed an actwhich was against their rules, his fate was put to the decision of all of them.The culprit had to explain his reasons for having done what he did. His comradeshad to listen to him; and then they either disbanded because they had found hisreasons convincing, or they lined up with their weapons at the very edge of aflat mountain very much like this mountain where we are sitting now, ready tocarry out his death sentence because they had found his reasons to beunacceptable. In that case the condemned warrior had to say good-by to his oldcomrades, and his execution began.\"Don Genaro looked at me and Pablito as if waiting for a sign from us. Then heturned to Nestor.\"Perhaps the witness here could tell us what the story has to do with thesetwo,\" he said to Nestor.Nestor smiled shyly and seemed to immerse himself deep in thought for a moment.\"The witness has no idea,\" he said and broke up into a nervous giggle.Don Genaro asked everyone to stand up and go with him to look over the west edgeof the mesa.There was a mild slope down to the bottom of the land formation, then there wasa narrow flat strip of land ending in a crevice that seemed to be a naturalchannel for the runoff of rain water.\"Right where that ditch is, there was a row of trees on the mountain in thestory,\" he said. \"Beyond that point there was a thick forest.\"After saying good-by to his comrades, the condemned warrior was supposed tobegin walking down the slope towards the trees. His comrades then cocked theirweapons and aimed at him. If no one shot, or if the warrior survived his woundsand reached the edge of the trees, he was free.\"We went back to the place where we had been sitting.\"How about now, witness?\" he asked Nestor. \"Can you tell?\"Nestor was the epitome [* epitome- a typical example] of nervousness. He tookoff his hat and scratched his head. He then hid his face in his hands.\"How can the poor witness know?\" he finally retorted in a challenging tone andlaughed with everybody else.\"They say that there were men who pulled through unharmed,\" don Genarocontinued. \"Let's say that their personal power affected their comrades. A wavewent through them as they were aiming at him and no one dared to use his weapon.Or perhaps they were in awe of his bravery and could not harm him.\"Don Genaro looked at me and then at Pablito.\"There was a condition set up for that walk to the edge of the trees,\" he wenton. \"The warrior had to walk calmly; unaffected. His steps had to be sure andfirm; his eyes looking straight ahead peacefully. He had to go down withoutstumbling, without turning to look back, and above all without running.\"Don Genaro paused; Pablito assented to his words by nodding.\"If you two decide to return to this earth,\" he said, \"you will have to waitlike true warriors until your tasks are fulfilled. That waiting is very muchlike the walk of the warrior in the story. You see, the warrior had run out ofhuman time and so have you. The only difference is in who is aiming at you.Those who were aiming at the warrior were his warrior comrades.\"But what's aiming at you two is the unknown. Your only chance is yourimpeccability. You must wait without looking back. You must wait withoutexpecting rewards. And you must aim all of your personal power at fulfillingyour tasks.\"If you don't act impeccably, if you begin to fret and get impatient anddesperate, you'll be cut down mercilessly by the sharpshooters from the unknown.\"If, on the other hand, your impeccability and personal power are such that youare capable of fulfilling your tasks, you will then achieve the promise ofpower. And what's that promise? you may ask. It is a promise that power makes tomen as luminous beings. Each warrior has a different fate, so there is no way oftelling what that promise will be for either of you.\"The sun was about to set. The light orange color on the distant northernmountains had become darker. The scenery gave me the feeling of a windsweptlonely world.\"You have learned that the backbone of a warrior is to be humble and efficient,\"don Genaro said and his voice made me jump. \"You have learned to act withoutexpecting anything in return. Now I tell you that in order to withstand whatlies ahead of you beyond this day, you'll need your ultimate forbearance.\" [*forbearance- a delay in exercising a rightful priveledge]I experienced a shock in my stomach. Pablito began to shiver quietly.\"A warrior must be always ready,\" he said. \"The fate of all of us here has beento know that we are the prisoners of power. No one knows why us in particular,but what a great fortune!\"Don Genaro stopped talking and lowered his head as if he were exhausted. Thathad been the first time that I had heard him speak in such terms.\"It is mandatory here that a warrior says good-by to all those present and toall those he leaves behind,\" don Juan said suddenly. \"He must do this in his ownwords and loudly, so his voice will remain here forever in this place of power.\"Don Juan's voice brought forth another dimension to my state of being at thatmoment. Our conversation in the car became all the more poignant. How right hewas when he had said that the serenity of the scenery around us was only amirage and that the sorcerers' explanation delivered a blow that no one couldparry.I had heard the sorcerers' explanation and I had experienced its premises. Yetthere I was more naked and more helpless than ever in my entire life. Nothingthat I had ever done, and nothing that I had ever imagined could even compare tothe anguish and the loneliness of that moment.The sorcerers' explanation had stripped me even of my 'reason'. Don Juan wasright again when he said that a warrior could not avoid pain and grief but onlythe indulging in them. At that moment my sadness was uncontainable. I could notstand to say good-by to those who had shared with me the turns of my fate. Itold don Juan and don Genaro that I had made a pact with someone to die togetherand that my spirit could not bear to leave alone.\"We are all alone, Carlitos,\" don Genaro said softly. \"That's our condition.\"I felt in my throat the anguish of my passion for life and for those close tome, I refused to say good-by to them.\"We are alone,\" don Juan said. \"But to die alone is not to die in loneliness.\"His voice sounded muffled and dry, like coughing.Pablito wept quietly. Then he stood up and spoke. It was not a harangue [*harangue- a loud bombastic declamation expressed with strong emotion] or atestimonial. In a clear voice he thanked don Genaro and don Juan for theirkindness. He turned to Nestor and thanked him for having given him theopportunity to take care of him. He wiped his eyes with his sleeve.\"What a wonderful thing it was to be in this beautiful world! In this marveloustime!\" he exclaimed and sighed.His mood was overwhelming.\"If I don't return I beg you as an ultimate favor to help those who have sharedmy fate,\" he said to don Genaro.He then turned towards the west in the direction of his home. His lean bodyconvulsed with tears. He ran towards the edge of the mesa with outstretched armsas if he were running to embrace someone. His lips moved, he seemed to betalking in a low voice.I turned my head away. I did not want to hear what Pablito was saying.He came back to where we were sitting, slumped down next to me, and lowered hishead.I was incapable of saying a thing. But then an outside force seemed to take overand made me stand up, and I too spoke my thanks and my sadness.We were quiet again. A north wind hissed softly, blowing in my face. Don Juanlooked at me. I had never seen so much kindness in his eyes. He said to me thata warrior said farewell by thanking all those who had had a gesture of kindnessor concern for him, and that I had to voice my gratitude not only to them butalso to those who had taken care of me and had helped me on my way.I faced the northwest, towards Los Angeles, and all the sentimentality of myspirit poured out. What a purifying release it was to voice my thanks!I sat down again. No one looked at me.\"A warrior acknowledges his pain but he doesn't indulge in it,\" don Juan said.\"Thus the mood of a warrior who enters into the unknown is not one of sadness.On the contrary, he's joyful because he feels humbled by his great fortune,confident that his spirit is impeccable, and above all, fully aware of hisefficiency. A warrior's joyfulness comes from having accepted his fate, and fromhaving truthfully assessed what lies ahead of him.\"There was a long pause. My sadness was paramount. [* paramount- having superiorpower and influence] I wanted to do something to get out of such oppressiveness.\"Witness, please squeeze your spirit catcher,\" don Genaro said to Nestor.I heard the loud, most ludicrous sound of Nestor's contraption.Pablito nearly got hysterical laughing, and so did don Juan and don Genaro. Inoticed a peculiar smell and realized then that Nestor had farted. What washorrendously funny was the expression of ultimate seriousness on his face. Hehad farted not as a joke but because he did not have his spirit catcher withhim. He was being helpful in the best way he could.All of them laughed with abandon. What facility they had for shifting fromsublime situations to utterly ludicrous ones.Pablito turned to me suddenly. He wanted to know if I was a poet, but before Icould answer his question don Genaro made a rhyme.\"Carlitos is really cool; he's got a bit of a poet, a nut and a fool,\" he said.They all had another outburst of laughter.\"That's a better mood,\" don Juan said. \"And now, before Genaro and I say good-byto you, you two may say anything you please. It might be the last time you uttera word, ever.\"Pablito shook his head negatively, but I had something to say. I wanted toexpress my admiration, my awe for the exquisite temper of don Juan and donGenaro's warrior spirit. But I became entangled in my words and ended up sayingnothing; or even worse yet, I ended up sounding as if I were complaining again.Don Juan shook his head and smacked his lips in mock disapproval. I laughedinvoluntarily. It did not matter, however, that I had flubbed my chance to tellthem of my admiration. A very intriguing sensation began to take possession ofme. I had a sense of exhilaration and joy; an exquisite freedom that made melaugh. I told don Juan and don Genaro that I did not give a fig about theoutcome of my encounter with the 'unknown', that I was happy and complete, andthat whether I lived or died was of no importance to me at that moment.Don Juan and don Genaro seemed to enjoy my assertions even more than I did. DonJuan slapped his thigh and laughed. Don Genaro threw his hat on the floor andyelled as if he were riding a wild horse.\"We have enjoyed ourselves and laughed while waiting, just as the witnessrecommended,\" don Genaro said all of a sudden. \"But it is the natural conditionof order that it should always come to an end.\"He looked at the sky.\"It's almost time for us to disband like the warriors in the story,\" he said.\"But before we go our separate ways I must tell you two one last thing. I amgoing to disclose to you a warrior's secret. Perhaps you can call it a warrior'spredilection.\"He addressed me in particular and said that once I had told him that the life ofa warrior was cold and lonely and devoid of feelings. He even added that at thatprecise moment I was convinced that it was so.\"The life of a warrior cannot possibly be cold and lonely and without feelings,\"he said, \"because it is based on his affection, his devotion, his dedication tohis beloved. And who, you may ask, is his beloved? I will show you now.\"Don Genaro stood up and walked slowly to a perfectly flat area right in front ofus, ten or twelve feet away. He made a strange gesture there. He moved his handsas if he were sweeping dust from his chest and his stomach. Then an odd thinghappened. A flash of an almost imperceptible light went through him. It camefrom the ground and seemed to kindle his entire body. He did a sort of backwardpirouette, a backward dive more properly speaking, and landed on his chest andarms. His movement had been executed with such precision and skill that heseemed to be a weightless being, a wormlike creature that had turned on itself.When he was on the ground he performed a series of unearthly movements. Heglided just a few inches above the ground, or rolled on it as if he were lyingon ball bearings; or he swam on it describing circles and turning with theswiftness and agility of an eel swimming in the ocean.My eyes began to cross at one moment and then without any transition I waswatching a ball of luminosity sliding back and forth on something that appearedto be the floor of an ice-skating rink with a thousand lights shining on it.The sight was sublime. Then the ball of fire came to rest and stayed motionless.A voice shook me and dispelled my attention. It was don Juan talking. I couldnot understand at first what he was saying. I looked again at the ball of fire.I could distinguish only don Genaro lying on the ground with his arms and legsspread out.Don Juan's voice was very clear. It seemed to trigger something in me and Ibegan to write.\"Genaro's love is the world,\" he said. \"He was just now embracing this enormousearth but since he's so little all he can do is swim in it. But the earth knowsthat Genaro loves it and it bestows on him its care. That's why Genaro's life isfilled to the brim and his state, wherever he'll be, will be plentiful. Genaroroams on the paths of his love and, wherever he is, he is complete.\"Don Juan squatted in front of us. He caressed the ground gently.\"This is the predilection of two warriors,\" he said. \"This earth, this world.For a warrior there can be no greater love.\"Don Genaro stood up and squatted next to don Juan for a moment while both ofthem peered fixedly at us, then they sat in unison, cross-legged.\"Only if one loves this earth with unbending passion can one release one'ssadness,\" don Juan said. \"A warrior is always joyful because his love isunalterable and his beloved, the earth, embraces him and bestows upon himinconceivable gifts. The sadness belongs only to those who hate the very thingthat gives shelter to their beings.\"Don Juan again caressed the ground with tenderness.\"This lovely being, which is alive to its last recesses and understands everyfeeling, soothed me, it cured me of my pains, and finally when I had fullyunderstood my love for it, it taught me freedom.\"He paused. The silence around us was frightening. The wind hissed softly andthen I heard the distant barking of a lone dog.\"Listen to that barking,\" don Juan went on. \"That is the way my beloved earth ishelping me now to bring this last point to you. That barking is the saddestthing one can hear.\"We were quiet for a moment. The barking of that lone dog was so sad and thestillness around us so intense that I experienced a numbing anguish. It made methink of my own life, my sadness, my not knowing where to go, what to do.\"That dog's barking is the nocturnal [* nocturnal- belonging to or active duringthe night] voice of a man,\" don Juan said. \"It comes from a house in that valleytowards the south. A man is shouting through his dog- since they are companionslaves for life- his sadness; his boredom. He's begging his death to come andrelease him from the dull and dreary chains of his life.\"Don Juan's words had caught a most disturbing line in me. I felt he was speakingdirectly to me.\"That barking, and the loneliness it creates, speaks of the feelings of men,\" hewent on. \"Men for whom an entire life was like one Sunday afternoon; anafternoon which was not altogether miserable, but rather hot and dull anduncomfortable. They sweated and fussed a great deal. They didn't know where togo, or what to do. That afternoon left them only with the memory of pettyannoyances and tedium, and then suddenly it was over. It was already night.\"He recounted a story I had once told him about a seventy-two year old man whocomplained that his life had been so short that it seemed to him that it wasonly the day before that he was a boy. The man had said to me, 'I remember thepajamas I used to wear when I was ten years old. It seems that only one day haspassed. Where did the time go?'\"The antidote that kills that poison is here,\" don Juan said, caressing theground. \"The sorcerers' explanation cannot at all liberate the spirit. Look atyou two. You have gotten to the sorcerers' explanation, but it doesn't make anydifference that you know it. You're more alone than ever, because without anunwavering love for the being that gives you shelter, aloneness is loneliness.\"Only the love for this splendorous being can give freedom to a warrior'sspirit; and freedom is joy, efficiency, and abandon in the face of any odds.That is the last lesson. It is always left for the very last moment, for themoment of ultimate solitude when a man faces his death and his aloneness. Onlythen does it make sense.\"Don Juan and don Genaro stood up and stretched their arms and arched theirbacks, as if sitting had made their bodies stiff. My heart began to pound fast.They made Pablito and me stand up.\"The twilight is the crack between the worlds,\" don Juan said. \"It is the doorto the unknown.\"He pointed with a sweeping movement of his hand to the mesa where we werestanding.\"This is the plateau in front of that door.\"He pointed then to the northern edge of the mesa.\"There is the door. Beyond, there is an abyss and beyond that abyss is theunknown.\"Don Juan and don Genaro then turned to Pablito and said good-by to him.Pablito's eyes were dilated and fixed; tears were rolling down his cheeks.I heard don Genaro's voice saying good-by to me, but I did not hear don Juan's.Don Juan and don Genaro moved towards Pablito and whispered briefly in his ears.Then they came to me. But before they had whispered anything I already had thatpeculiar feeling of being split.\"We will now be like dust on the road,\" don Genaro said. \"Perhaps it will get inyour eyes again, someday.\"Don Juan and don Genaro stepped back and seemed to merge with the darkness.Pablito held my forearm and we said good-by to each other. Then a strange urge,a force, made me run with him to the northern edge of the mesa. I felt his armholding me as we jumped and then I was alone. ### \"Tales of Power\" - by Carlos Castaneda - The End ###"}]
