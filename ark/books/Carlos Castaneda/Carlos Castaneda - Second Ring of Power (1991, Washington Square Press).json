The solemnity and the scope ofwhat took place there left no doubt in my mind that our apprenticeships had cometo their concluding moment, and that I was indeed seeing don Juan and don Genarofor the last time. Toward the end we all said good-bye to one another, and thenPablito and I jumped together from the top of the mountain into an abyss.Prior to that jump don Juan had presented a fundamental principle for all thatwas going to happen to me. According to him, upon jumping into the abyss I wasgoing to become pure perception and move back and forth between the two inherentrealms of all creation, the tonal and the nagual.In my jump my perception went through seventeen elastic bounces between thetonal and the nagual. In my moves into the nagual I perceived my bodydisintegrating. I could not think or feel in the coherent, unifying sense that Iordinarily do, but I somehow thought and felt. In my moves into the tonal Iburst into unity. I was whole. My perception had coherence. I had visions oforder. Their compelling force was so intense, their vividness so real, and theircomplexity so vast that I have not been capable of explaining them to mysatisfaction. To say that they were visions, vivid dreams or even hallucinationsdoes not say anything to clarify their nature.After having examined and analyzed in a most thorough and careful manner myfeelings, perceptions and interpretations of that jump into the abyss, I hadcome to the point where I could not rationally believe that it had actuallyhappened. And yet another part of me held on steadfast to the feeling that itdid happen; that I did jump.Don Juan and don Genaro are no longer available, and their absence has createdin me a most pressing need; the need to make headway in the midst of apparentlyinsoluble contradictions.I went back to Mexico to see Pablito and Nestor to seek their help in resolvingmy conflicts. But what I encountered on my trip cannot be described in any otherway except as a final assault on my reason; a concentrated attack designed bydon Juan himself. His apprentices, under his absentee direction, in a mostmethodical and precise fashion demolished in a few days the last bastion of myreason. In those few days they revealed to me one of the two practical aspectsof their sorcery; the 'art of dreaming'; which is the core of the present work.The 'art of stalking' was the other practical aspect of their sorcery, and wasalso the crowning stone of don Juan's and don Genaro's teachings. It waspresented to me during subsequent visits. The art of stalking was by far themost complex facet of their being on the Earth as individuals seeking the'totality of themselves'. ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"1. The Transformation of Dona Soledad I had a sudden premonition that Pablito and Nestor were not home. My certaintywas so profound that I stopped my car. I was at the place where the asphalt cameto an abrupt end, and I wanted to reconsider whether or not to continue that daythe long and difficult drive on the steep, coarse gravel road to their hometownin the mountains of central Mexico.I rolled down the window of my car. It was rather windy and cold. I got out tostretch my legs. The tension of driving for hours had stiffened my back andneck. I walked to the edge of the paved road. The ground was wet from an earlyshower. Rain was still falling heavily on the slopes of the mountains to thesouth a short distance from where I was; but right in front of me toward theeast, and also toward the north, the sky was clear. At certain points on thewinding road I had been able to see the bluish peaks of the sierras shining inthe sunlight a great distance away.After a moment's deliberation, I decided to turn back and go to the city becauseI had a most peculiar feeling that I was going to find don Juan in the market.After all, I had always done just that; found him in the marketplace.Since the beginning of my association with him, as a rule, if I did not find himin Sonora, I would drive to central Mexico and go to the market of thatparticular city; and sooner or later don Juan would show up. The longest I hadever waited for him was two days. I was so habituated to meeting him in thatmanner, that I had the most absolute certainty that I would find him again as Ialways had.I waited in the market all afternoon. I walked up and down the aisles pretendingto be looking for something to buy. Then I waited around the park.At dusk I knew that he was not coming. I had then the clear sensation that hehad been there, but had left. I sat down on a park bench where I used to sitwith him and tried to analyze my feelings.Upon arriving in the city I had been elated with the sure knowledge that donJuan was there in the streets. What I felt had been more than the memory ofhaving found him there countless times before. My body had known that he waslooking for me.But then as I sat on the bench, I had another kind of strange certainty. I knewthat he was not there anymore. He had left and I had missed him.After a while I discarded my speculations. I thought that I was beginning to beaffected by the place. I was starting to get irrational. That had alwayshappened to me in the past after a few days in that area.I went to my hotel room to rest for a few hours and then I went out again toroam the streets. I did not have the same expectation of finding don Juan that Ihad had in the afternoon. I gave up. I went back to my hotel in order to get agood night's sleep.Before I headed for the mountains in the morning, I drove up and down the mainstreets in my car; but somehow I knew that I was wasting my time. Don Juan wasnot there.It took me all morning to drive to the little town where Pablito and Nestorlived. I arrived around noon. Don Juan had taught me never to drive directlyinto the town so as not to arouse the curiosity of onlookers. Every time I hadbeen there I had always driven off the road just before reaching the town- ontoa flat field where youngsters usually played soccer. The dirt was well packedall the way to a walking trail which was wide enough for a car and which passedby Pablito's and Nestor's houses in the foothills south of town. As soon as Igot to the edge of the field I found that the walking trail had been turned intoa gravel road.I deliberated whether to go to Nestor's house or Pablito's. The feeling thatthey were not there still persisted. I opted to go to Pablito's. I reasoned thatNestor lived alone whereas Pablito lived with his mother and his four sisters.If he was not there, the women could help me find him.As I got closer to his house, I noticed that the path leading from the road upto the house had been widened. It looked as if the ground was hard, and sincethere was enough space for my car, I drove almost to the front door.A new porch with a tile roof had been added to the adobe house. There were nodogs barking, but I saw an enormous one sitting calmly and alertly observing mefrom behind a fenced area. A flock of chickens that had been feeding in front ofthe house scattered around cackling. I turned the motor off and stretched myarms over my head. My body was stiff.The house seemed deserted. The thought crossed my mind that perhaps Pablito andhis family had moved away and that someone else was living there. Suddenly thefront door opened with a bang and Pablito's mother stepped out as if someone hadpushed her. She stared at me absentmindedly for an instant.As I got out of my car, she seemed to recognize me. A graceful shiver ranthrough her body and she ran toward me. I thought that she must have beennapping and that the noise of the car had woken her; and when she came out tosee what was going on she did not know at first who I was.The incongruous sight of the old woman running toward me made me smile. When shegot closer, I had a moment of doubt. Somehow she moved so nimbly that she didnot seem like Pablito's mother at all.\"My goodness what a surprise!\" she exclaimed.\"Dona Soledad?\" I asked, incredulously.\"Don't you recognize me?\" she replied, laughing.I made some stupid comments about her surprising agility.\"Why do you always see me as a helpless old woman?\" she asked, looking at mewith an air of mock challenge. She bluntly accused me of having nicknamed her\"Mrs. Pyramid.\"I remembered that I had once said to Nestor that her shape reminded me of apyramid. She had a very broad and massive behind, and a small pointed head. Thelong dresses that she usually wore added to the effect.\"Look at me,\" she said. \"Do I still look like a pyramid?\"She was smiling but her eyes made me feel uncomfortable. I attempted to defendmyself by making a joke, but she cut me off and coaxed me to admit that I wasresponsible for the nickname.I assured her that I had never intended it as such, and that, anyway, at thatmoment she was so lean that her shape was the furthest thing from a pyramid.\"What's happened to you, dona Soledad?\" I asked. \"You're transformed.\"\"You said it,\" she replied briskly. \"I've been transformed!\"I meant it figuratively. However, upon closer examination I had to admit thatthere was no room for a metaphor. She was truly a changed person. I suddenly hada dry, metallic taste in my mouth. I was afraid.She placed her fists on her hips and stood with her legs slightly apart facingme. She was wearing a light green gathered skirt and a whitish blouse. Her skirtwas shorter than those she used to wear. I could not see her hair. She had ittied with a thick band; a turban-like piece of cloth. She was barefoot and sherhythmically tapped her big feet on the ground as she smiled with the candor ofa young girl.I had never seen anyone exude as much strength as she did. I noticed a strangegleam in her eyes; a disturbing gleam, but not a frightening one. I thought thatperhaps I had never really examined her appearance carefully. Among otherthings, I felt guilty for having glossed over many people during my years withdon Juan. The force of his personality had rendered everyone else pale andunimportant.I told her that I had never imagined that she could have such a stupendousvitality; that my carelessness was to blame for not really knowing her; and thatno doubt I would have to meet everyone else all over again.She came closer to me. She smiled and put her right hand on the back of my leftarm; grabbing it gently.\"That's for sure,\" she whispered in my ear.Her smile froze and her eyes became glazed. She was so close to me that I felther breasts rubbing my left shoulder. My discomfort increased as I tried toconvince myself that there was no reason for alarm. I repeated to myself overand over that I really had never known Pablito's mother, and that in spite ofher odd behavior, she was probably being her normal self.But some frightened part of me knew that those were only bracing thoughts withno substance at all; because no matter how much I may have glossed over herperson, not only did I remember her very well, I had known her very well.She had represented to me the archetype of a mother. I had thought her to be inher late fifties or even older. Her weak muscles had moved her bulky weight withextreme difficulty. Her hair had a lot of gray in it.She was, as I remembered her, a sad, somber woman with kind, handsome features;a dedicated, suffering mother; always in the kitchen; always tired. I alsoremembered her to be a very gentle and unselfish woman, and a very timid one;timid to the point of being thoroughly subservient to anyone who happened to bearound.That was the picture I had had of her; reinforced throughout years of casualcontact.This day something was terribly different. The woman I was confronting did notat all fit the image I had of Pablito's mother, and yet she was the same person;leaner, stronger, and looking twenty years younger than the last time I had seenher. I felt a shiver in my body.She moved a couple of steps in front of me and faced me.\"Let me look at you,\" she said. \"The Nagual told us that you're a devil.\"I remembered then that all of them- Pablito, his mother, his sisters and Nestor-had always seemed unwilling to voice don Juan's name, and called him \"theNagual;\" a usage which I myself adopted when talking with them.She daringly put her hands on my shoulders; something she had never done before.My body tensed. I really did not know what to say. There was a long pause thatallowed me to take stock of myself. Her appearance and behavior had frightenedme to the point that I had forgotten to ask about Pablito and Nestor.\"Tell me, where is Pablito?\" I asked her with a sudden wave of apprehension.\"Oh, he's gone to the mountains,\" she responded in a noncommittal tone, andmoved away from me.\"And where is Nestor?\"She rolled her eyes as if to show her indifference.\"They are together in the mountains,\" she said in the same tone.I felt genuinely relieved and told her that I had known without the shadow of adoubt that they were all right.She glanced at me and smiled. A wave of happiness and ebullience came upon me,and I embraced her. She boldly returned the embrace and held me. That act was sooutlandish that it took my breath away. Her body was rigid. I sensed anextraordinary strength in her. My heart began to pound. I gently tried to pushher away as I asked her if Nestor was still seeing don Genaro and don Juan.During our farewell meeting don Juan had expressed doubts that Nestor was readyto finish his apprenticeship.\"Genaro has left forever,\" she said letting go of me.She fretted nervously with the edge of her blouse.\"How about don Juan?\"\"The Nagual is gone too,\" she said, puckering her lips.\"Where did they go?\"\"You mean you don't know?\"I told her that both of them had said good-bye to me two years before, and thatall I knew was that they were leaving at that time. I had not really dared tospeculate where they had gone. They had never told me their whereabouts in thepast and I had come to accept the fact that if they wanted to disappear from mylife, all they had to do was to refuse to see me.\"They're not around, that's for sure,\" she said, frowning, \"And they won't becoming back, that's also for sure.\"Her voice was extremely unemotional. I began to feel annoyed with her. I wantedto leave.\"But you're here,\" she said, changing her frown into a smile. \"You must wait forPablito and Nestor. They've been dying to see you.\"She held my arm firmly and pulled me away from my car. Compared to the way shehad been in the past, her boldness was astounding.\"But first, let me show you my friend,\" she said, and forcibly led me to theside of the house.There was a fenced area, like a small corral. A huge male dog was there. Thefirst thing that attracted my attention was his healthy, lustrous,yellowish-brown fur. He did not seem to be a mean dog. He was not chained andthe fence was not high enough to hold him. The dog remained impassive, as we gotcloser to him; not even wagging his tail. Dona Soledad pointed to a good-sizedcage in the back. A coyote was curled up inside.\"That's my friend,\" she said. \"The dog is not. He belongs to my girls.\"The dog looked at me and yawned. I liked him. I had a nonsensical feeling ofkinship with him.\"Come, let's go into the house,\" she said, pulling me by the arm.I hesitated. Some part of me was utterly alarmed and wanted to get out of therequickly, and yet another part of me would not have left for the world.\"You're not afraid of me, are you?\" she asked in an accusing tone.\"I most certainly am!\" I exclaimed.She giggled, and in a most comforting tone she declared that she was a clumsy,primitive woman who was very awkward with words, and that she hardly knew how totreat people. She looked straight into my eyes and said that don Juan hadcommissioned her to help me because he worried about me.\"He told us that you're not serious, and go around causing a lot of trouble toinnocent people,\" she said.Up to that point her assertions had been coherent to me but I could not conceivedon Juan saying those things about me.We went inside the house. I wanted to sit down on the bench where Pablito and Iusually sat. She stopped me.\"This is not the place for you and me,\" she said. \"Let's go to my room.\"\"I'd rather sit here,\" I said firmly. \"I know this spot and I feel comfortableon it.\"She clicked her lips in disapproval. She acted like a disappointed child. Shecontracted her upper lip until it looked like the flat beak of a duck.\"There is something terribly wrong here,\" I said. \"I think I am going to leaveif you don't tell me what's going on.\"She became very flustered and argued that her trouble was not knowing how totalk to me. I confronted her with her unmistakable transformation and demandedthat she tell me what had happened. I had to know how such a change had comeabout.\"If I tell you, will you stay?\" she asked in a child's voice.\"I'll have to.\"\"In that case I'll tell you everything. But it has to be in my room.\"I had a moment of panic. I made a supreme effort to calm myself and we walkedinto her room. She lived in the back where Pablito had built a bedroom for her.I had once been in the room while it was being built and also after it wasfinished; just before she moved in. The room looked as empty as I had seen itbefore, except that there was a bed in the very center of it and two unobtrusivechests of drawers by the door.The whitewash of the walls had faded into a very soothing yellowish white. Thewood of the ceiling had also weathered. Looking at the smooth, clean walls, Ihad the impression they were scrubbed daily with a sponge.The room looked more like a monastic cell; very frugal and ascetic. There wereno ornaments of any sort. The windows had thick, removable wood panelsreinforced with an iron bar. There were no chairs or anything to sit on.Dona Soledad took my writing pad away from me, held it to her bosom, and thensat down on her bed which was made up of two thick mattresses with no boxsprings. She indicated that I should sit down next to her.\"You and I are the same,\" she said as she handed me my notebook.\"I beg your pardon?\"\"You and I are the same,\" she repeated without looking at me.I could not figure out what she meant. She stared at me as if waiting for aresponse.\"Just what is that supposed to mean, dona Soledad?\" I asked.My question seemed to baffle her. Obviously she expected me to know what shemeant. She laughed at first, but then, when I insisted that I did notunderstand, she got angry. She sat up straight and accused me of being dishonestwith her. Her eyes flared with rage. Her mouth contracted in a very ugly gestureof wrath that made her look extremely old.I honestly was at a loss and felt that no matter what I said it would be wrong.She also seemed to be in the same predicament. Her mouth moved to say somethingbut her lips only quivered. At last she muttered that it was not impeccable toact the way I did at such a serious moment. She turned her back to me.\"Look at me, dona Soledad!\" I said forcefully. \"I'm not mystifying you in anysense. You must know something that I know nothing about.\"\"You talk too much,\" she snapped angrily. \"The Nagual told me never to let youtalk. You twist everything.\"She jumped to her feet and stomped on the floor like a spoiled child. I becameaware at that moment that the room had a different floor. I remembered it to bea dirt floor made from the dark soil of the area. The new floor was reddishpink.I momentarily put off a confrontation with her and walked around the room. Icould not imagine how I could have missed noticing the floor when I firstentered. It was magnificent.At first I thought that it was red clay that had been laid like cement when itwas soft and moist, but then I saw that there were no cracks in it. Clay wouldhave dried, curled up, cracked, and clumps would have formed.I bent down and gently ran my fingers over it. It was as hard as bricks. Theclay had been fired. I became aware then that the floor was made of very largeflat slabs of clay put together over a bed of soft clay that served as a matrix.The slabs made a most intricate and fascinating design, but a thoroughlyunobtrusive one unless one paid deliberate attention to it.The skill with which the slabs had been placed in position indicated to me avery well-conceived plan. I wanted to know how such big slabs had been firedwithout being warped. I turned around to ask dona Soledad, but I quicklydesisted. She would not have known what I was talking about. I paced over thefloor again. The clay was a bit rough; almost like sandstone. It made a perfectslide-proof surface.\"Did Pablito put down this floor?\" I asked.She did not answer.\"It's a superb piece of work,\" I said. \"You should be very proud of him.\"I had no doubt that Pablito had done it. No one else could have had theimagination and the capacity to conceive of it. I figured that he must have madeit during the time I had been away. But on second thought I realized that I hadnever entered dona Soledad's room since it had been built, six or seven yearsbefore.\"Pablito! Pablito! Bah!\" she exclaimed in an angry, raspy voice. \"What makes youthink he's the only one who can make things?\"We exchanged a long, sustained look, and all of a sudden I knew that it was shewho had made the floor, and that don Juan had put her up to it.We stood quietly, looking at each other for some time. I felt it would have beenthoroughly superfluous to ask if I was correct.\"I made it myself,\" she finally said in a dry tone. \"The Nagual told me how.\"Her statements made me feel euphoric. I practically lifted her up in an embrace.I twirled her around. All I could think to do was to bombard her with questions.I wanted to know how she had made the slabs; what the designs represented; whereshe got the clay. But she did not share my exhilaration. She remained quiet andimpassive, and looked at me askance from time to time.I paced on the floor again. The bed had been placed at the very epicenter ofsome converging lines. The clay slabs had been cut in sharp angles to createconverging motifs that seemed to radiate out from under the bed.\"I have no words to tell you how impressed I am,\" I said.\"Words! Who needs words?\" she said cuttingly.I had a flash of insight. My reason had been betraying me. There was only onepossible way of explaining her magnificent metamorphosis. Don Juan must havemade her his apprentice. How else could an old woman like dona Soledad turn intosuch a weird, powerful being? That should have been obvious to me from themoment I laid eyes on her, but my set of expectations about her had not includedthat possibility.I deduced that whatever don Juan had done to her must have taken place duringthe two years I had not seen her, although two years seemed hardly any time atall for such a superb alteration.\"I think I know now what happened to you,\" I said in a casual and cheerful tone.\"Something has cleared up in my mind right now.\"\"Oh, is that so?\" she said, thoroughly uninterested.\"The Nagual is teaching you to be a sorceress, isn't that true?\"She glared at me defiantly. I felt that I had said the worst possible thing.There was an expression of true contempt on her face. She was not going to tellme anything.\"What a bastard you are!\" she exclaimed suddenly, shaking with rage.I thought that her anger was unjustified. I sat down on one end of the bed whileshe nervously tapped on the floor with her heel. Then she sat down on the otherend without looking at me.\"What exactly do you want me to do?\" I asked in a firm and intimidating tone.\"I told you already! \" she said in a yell. \"You and I are the same.\"I asked her to explain her meaning and not to assume for one instant that I knewanything. Those statements angered her even more. She stood up abruptly anddropped her skirt to the ground.\"This is what I mean!\" she yelled, caressing her pubic area.My mouth opened involuntarily. I became aware that I was staring at her like anidiot.\"You and I are one here!\" she said.I was dumbfounded. Dona Soledad, the old Indian woman, mother of my friendPablito, was actually half-naked a few feet away from me showing me hergenitals. I stared at her incapable of formulating any thoughts. The only thingI knew was that her body was not the body of an old woman. She had beautifullymuscular thighs, dark and hairless. The bone structure of her hips was broad,but there was no fat on them.She must have noticed my scrutiny and flung herself on the bed.\"You know what to do,\" she said, pointing to her pubis. \"We are one here.\"She uncovered her robust breasts.\"Dona Soledad, I implore you!\" I exclaimed. \"What's come over you? You'rePablito's mother.\"\"No, I'm not! \" she snapped. \"I'm no one's mother.\"She sat up and looked at me with fierce eyes.\"I am just like you; a piece of the Nagual,\" she said. \"We're made to mix.\"She opened her legs and I jumped away.\"Wait a minute, dona Soledad,\" I said. \"Let's talk for a while.\"I had a moment of wild fear, and a sudden crazy thought occurred to me. Would itbe possible, I asked myself, that don Juan was hiding somewhere around therelaughing his head off?\"Don Juan!\" I bellowed.My yell was so loud and profound that dona Soledad jumped off her bed, andcovered herself hurriedly with her skirt. I saw her putting it on as I bellowedagain.\"Don Juan!\"I ran through the house bellowing don Juan's name until my throat was sore. DonaSoledad, in the meantime, had run outside the house and was standing by my carlooking puzzled at me.I walked over to her and asked her if don Juan had told her to do all that. Shenodded affirmatively. I asked if he was around. She said no.\"Tell me everything,\" I said.She told me that she was merely following don Juan's orders. He had commandedher to change her being into a warrior's in order to help me. She declared thatshe had been waiting for years to fulfill that promise.\"I'm very strong now,\" she said softly. \"Just for you. But you disliked me in myroom, didn't you?\"I found myself explaining that I did not dislike her; that what counted were myfeelings for Pablito. Then I realized that I did not have the vaguest idea ofwhat I was saying.Dona Soledad seemed to understand my embarrassing position and said that ourmishap had to be forgotten.\"You must be famished,\" she said vivaciously. \"I'll make you some food.\"\"There's a lot that you haven't explained to me,\" I said. \"I'll be frank withyou: I wouldn't stay here for anything in the world. You frighten me.\"\"You are obligated to accept my hospitality if it is only for a cup of coffee,\"she said unruffled. \"Come, let's forget what happened.\"She made a gesture of going into the house. At that moment I heard a deep growl.The dog was standing and looking at us as if he understood what was being said.Dona Soledad fixed a most frightening gaze on me. Then she softened it andsmiled.\"Don't let my eyes bother you,\" she said. \"The truth is that I am old. LatelyI've been getting dizzy. I think I need glasses.\"She broke into a laugh and clowned by looking through cupped fingers as if theywere glasses.\"An old Indian woman with glasses! That'll be a laugh,\" she said giggling.I made up my mind then to be rude and get out of there without any explanation;but before I drove away, I wanted to leave some things for Pablito and hissisters.I opened the trunk of the car to get the gifts I had brought for them. I leanedway into the trunk to reach first the two packages that were lodged against thewall of the back seat behind the spare tire. I got hold of one and was about tograb the other when I felt a soft, furry hand on the nape of my neck.I shrieked involuntarily and hit my head on the open lid. I turned to look. Thepressure of the furry hand did not let me turn completely, but I was able tocatch a fleeting glimpse of a silvery arm or paw hovering over my neck. Iwriggled in panic and pushed myself away from the trunk, and fell down on myseat with the package still in my hand. My whole body shook. The muscles of mylegs contracted, and I found myself leaping up and running away.\"I didn't mean to frighten you,\" dona Soledad said apologetically as I watchedher from ten feet away.She showed me the palms of her hands in a gesture of surrender; as if assuringme that what I had felt was not her hand.\"What did you do to me?\" I asked, trying to sound calm and detached.She seemed to be either thoroughly embarrassed or baffled. She mutteredsomething and shook her head as though she could not say it, or did not knowwhat I was talking about.\"Come on, dona Soledad,\" I said, coming closer to her, \"don't play tricks onme.\"She seemed about to weep. I wanted to comfort her, but some part of me resisted.After a moment's pause I told her what I had felt and seen.\"That's just terrible!\" She said in a shrieking voice.In a very childlike gesture she covered her face with her right forearm. Ithought she was crying. I came over to her and tried to put my arm around hershoulders. I could not bring myself to do it.\"Come now, dona Soledad,\" I said, \"let's forget all this and let me give youthese packages before I leave.\"I stepped in front of her to face her. I could see her black, shining eyes andpart of her face behind her arm. She was not crying. She was smiling.I jumped back. Her smile terrified me. Both of us stood motionless for a longtime. She kept her face covered but I could see her eyes watching me.As I stood there almost paralyzed with fear I felt utterly despondent. I hadfallen into a bottomless pit. Dona Soledad was a witch. My body knew it, and yetI could not really believe it. What I wanted to believe was that dona Soledadhad gone mad and was being kept in the house instead of an asylum.I did not dare move or take my eyes away from her. We must have stayed in thatposition for five or six minutes. She had kept her arm raised and yetmotionless. She was standing at the rear of the car almost leaning against theleft fender. The lid of the trunk was still open. I thought of making a dash forthe right door. The keys were in the ignition.I relaxed a bit in order to gain the momentum to run. She seemed to notice mychange of position immediately. Her arm moved down, revealing her whole face.Her teeth were clenched. Her eyes were fixed on mine. They looked hard and mean.Suddenly she lurched toward me. She stomped with her right foot, like a fencer,and reached out with clawed hands to grab me by my waist as she let out the mostchilling shriek.My body jumped back out of her reach. I ran for the car, but with inconceivableagility she rolled to my feet and made me trip over her. I fell facedown and shegrabbed me by the left foot. I contracted my right leg, and I would have kickedher in the face with the sole of my shoe had she not let go of me and rolledback.I jumped to my feet and tried to open the door of the car. It was locked. Ithrew myself over the hood to reach the other side but somehow dona Soledad gotthere before I did. I tried to roll back over the hood, but midway I felt asharp pain in my right calf. She had grabbed me by the leg.I could not kick her with my left foot. She had pinned down both of my legsagainst the hood. She pulled me toward her and I fell on top of her. We wrestledon the ground. Her strength was magnificent and her shrieks were terrifying. Icould hardly move under the gigantic pressure of her body. It was not a matterof weight but rather tension, and she had it.Suddenly I heard a growl, and the enormous dog jumped on her back and shoved heraway from me. I stood up. I wanted to get into the car, but the woman and thedog were fighting by the door. The only retreat was to go inside the house. Imade it in one or two seconds.I did not turn to look at them, but rushed inside and closed the door behind me-securing it with the iron bar that was behind it. I ran to the back and did thesame with the other door.From inside I could hear the furious growling of the dog and the woman's inhumanshrieks. Then suddenly the dog's barking and growling turned into whining andhowling as if he were in pain, or as if something were frightening him.I felt a jolt in the pit of my stomach. My ears began to buzz. I realized that Iwas trapped inside the house. I had a fit of sheer terror. I was revolted at mystupidity in running into the house. The woman's attack had confused me sointensely that I had lost all sense of strategy and I had behaved as if I wererunning away from an ordinary opponent who could be shut out by simply closing adoor. I heard someone come to the door and lean against it trying to force itopen. Then there were loud knocks and banging on it.\"Open the door,\" dona Soledad said in a hard voice. \"That goddamned dog hasmauled me.\"I deliberated whether or not to let her in. What came to my mind was the memoryof a confrontation I had had years before with a sorceress, who had, accordingto don Juan adopted his shape in order to fool me and deliver a deadly blow.Obviously dona Soledad was not as I had known her, but I had reasons to doubtthat she was a sorceress.The time element played a decisive role in my conviction. Pablito, Nestor and Ihad been involved with don Juan and don Genaro for years, and we were notsorcerers at all. How could dona Soledad be one? No matter how much she hadchanged, she could not improvise something that would take a lifetime toaccomplish.\"Why did you attack me?\" I asked, speaking loudly so as to be heard through thethick door.She answered that the Nagual had told her not to let me go. I asked her why.She did not answer. Instead she banged on the door furiously and I banged backeven harder. We went on hitting the door for a few minutes. She stopped andstarted begging me to open it. I had a surge of nervous energy. I knew that if Iopened the door I might have a chance to flee. I moved the iron bar from thedoor. She staggered in. Her blouse was torn. The band that held her hair hadfallen off and her long hair was all over her face.\"Look what that son of a bitch dog did to me!\" she yelled. \"Look! Look!\"I took a deep breath. She seemed to be somewhat dazed. She sat down on a benchand began to take off her tattered blouse. I seized that moment to run out ofthe house and make a dash for the car. With a speed that was born only out offear, I got inside, shut the door, automatically turned on the motor, and putthe car in reverse.I stepped on the gas and turned my head to look back through the rear window. AsI turned I felt a hot breath on my face. I heard a horrendous growl, and saw ina flash the demoniacal eyes of the dog. He was standing on the back seat. I sawhis horrible teeth almost in my eyes.I ducked my head. His teeth grabbed my hair. I must have curled my whole body onthe seat, and in doing so I let my foot off the clutch. The jerk of the car madethe beast lose his balance. I opened the door and scrambled out. The head of thedog jutted out through the door. I heard his enormous teeth click as his jawsclosed tight missing my heels by a few inches. The car began to roll back and Imade another dash for the house.I stopped before I had reached the door.Dona Soledad was standing there. She had tied her hair up again. She had throwna shawl over her shoulders. She stared at me for a moment and then began tolaugh, very softly at first as if her wounds hurt her, and then loudly. Shepointed a finger at me and held her stomach as she convulsed with laughter. Shebent over and stretched, seemingly to catch her breath. She was naked above thewaist. I could see her breasts, shaking with the convulsions of her laughter.I felt that all was lost. I looked back toward the car. It had come to a stopafter rolling four or five feet. The door had closed again sealing the doginside. I could see and hear the enormous beast biting the back of the frontseat and pawing the windows.A most peculiar decision faced me at that moment. I did not know who scared methe most, dona Soledad or the dog. After a moment's thought I decided that thedog was just a stupid beast.I ran back to the car and climbed up on the roof. The noise enraged the dog. Iheard him ripping the upholstery. Lying on the roof I managed to open thedriver's door. My idea was to open both doors, and then slide from the roof intothe car through one of them after the dog had gone out the other one.I leaned over to open the right door. I had forgotten that it was locked. Atthat moment the dog's head came out through the opened door. I had an attack ofblind panic at the idea that the dog was going to jump out of the car and ontothe roof.In less than a second I had leaped to the ground and found myself standing atthe door of the house.Dona Soledad was bracing herself in the doorway. Laughter came out of her inspurts that seemed almost painful.The dog had remained inside the car; still frothing with rage. Apparently he wastoo large and could not squeeze his bulky frame over the front seat. I went tothe car and gently closed the door again. I began to look for a stick longenough to release the safety lock on the right-hand door.I searched in the area in front of the house. There was not a single piece ofwood lying around. Dona Soledad, in the meantime, had gone inside. I assessed mysituation. I had no other alternative but to ask her help. With greattrepidation, I crossed the threshold; looking in every direction in case shemight have been hiding behind the door waiting for me.\"Dona Soledad!\" I yelled out.\"What the hell do you want?\" she yelled back from her room.\"Would you please go out and get your dog out of my car?\" I said.\"Are you kidding?\" she replied. \"That's not my dog. I've told you already. Hebelongs to my girls.\"\"Where are your girls?\" I asked.\"They are in the mountains,\" she replied.She came out of her room and faced me.\"Do you want to see what that goddamned dog did to me?\" she asked in a dry tone.\"Look!\"She unwrapped her shawl and showed me her naked back.I found no visible tooth marks on her back. There were only a few longsuperficial scratches she might have gotten by rubbing against the hard ground.For that matter, she could have scratched herself when she attacked me.\"You have nothing there,\" I said.\"Come and look in the light,\" she said and went over by the door.She insisted that I look carefully for the gashes of the dog's teeth. I feltstupid. I had a heavy sensation around my eyes especially on my brow. I wentoutside instead. The dog had not moved and began to bark as soon as I came outthe door.I cursed myself. There was no one to blame but me. I had walked into that traplike a fool. I resolved right then to walk to town. But my wallet, my papers,everything I had was in my briefcase on the floor of the car right under thedog's feet. I had an attack of despair. It was useless to walk to town. I didnot have enough money in my pockets even to buy a cup of coffee. Besides, I didnot know a soul in town. I had no other alternative but to get the dog out ofthe car.\"What kind of food does that dog eat?\" I yelled from the door.\"Why don't you try your leg?\" dona Soledad yelled back from her room, andcackled.I looked for some cooked food in the house. The pots were empty. There wasnothing else for me to do but to confront her again. My despair had turned intorage. I stormed into her room ready for a fight to the death. She was lying onher bed, covered with her shawl.\"Please forgive me for having done all those things to you,\" she said bluntly,looking at the ceiling.Her boldness stopped my rage.\"You must understand my position,\" she went on. \"I couldn't let you go.\"She laughed softly, and in a clear, calm and very pleasing voice she said thatshe was guilty of being greedy and clumsy; that she had nearly succeeded inscaring me away with her antics; but that the situation had suddenly changed.She paused, and sat up in her bed; covering her breasts with her shawl; thenadded that a strange confidence had descended into her body. She looked up atthe ceiling and moved her arms in a weird rhythmical flow like a windmill.\"There is no way for you to leave now,\" she said.She scrutinized me without laughing. My internal rage had subsided, but mydespair was more acute than ever. I honestly knew that in matters of sheerstrength I was no match for her or the dog.She said that our appointment had been set up years in advance, and that neitherof us had enough power to hurry it or break it.\"Don't knock yourself out trying to leave,\" she said. \"That's as useless as mytrying to keep you here. Something besides your will will release you from here,and something besides my will will keep you here.\"Somehow her confidence had not only mellowed her, but had given her a greatcommand over words. Her statements were compelling and crystal clear. Don Juanhad always said that I was a trusting soul when it came to words.As she talked I found myself thinking that she was not really as threatening asI thought. She no longer projected the feeling of having a chip on her shoulder.My reason was almost at ease, but another part of me was not. All the muscles ofmy body were like tense wires, and yet I had to admit to myself that althoughshe scared me out of my wits, I found her most appealing. She watched me.\"I'll show you how useless it is to try to leave,\" she said, jumping out of bed.\"I'm going to help you. What do you need?\"She observed me with a gleam in her eyes. Her small white teeth gave her smile adevilish touch. Her chubby face was strangely smooth and fairly free ofwrinkles. Two deep lines running from the sides of her nose to the corners ofher mouth gave her face the appearance of maturity, but not age. In standing upfrom the bed, she casually let her shawl fall straight down; uncovering her fullbreasts. She did not bother to cover herself. Instead she swelled up her chestand lifted her breasts.\"Oh, you've noticed, eh?\" she said, and rocked her body from side to side as ifpleased with herself. \"I always keep my hair tied behind my head. The Nagualtold me to do so. The pull makes my face younger.\"I had been sure that she was going to talk about her breasts. Her shift was asurprise to me.\"I don't mean that the pull on my hair is going to make me look younger,\" shewent on with a charming smile. \"The pull on my hair makes me younger.\"\"How is that possible?\" I asked.She answered me with a question. She wanted to know if I had correctlyunderstood don Juan when he said that anything was possible if one wants it withunbending intent.I was after a more precise explanation. I wanted to know what else she didbesides tying her hair in order to look so young. She said that she lay in herbed and emptied herself of any thoughts and feelings, and then let the lines ofher floor pull her wrinkles away. I pressed her for more details: any feelings,sensations, or perceptions that she had experienced while lying on her bed. Sheinsisted that she felt nothing, that she did not know how the lines in her floorworked, and that she only knew not to let her thoughts interfere.She placed her hands on my chest and shoved me very gently. It seemed to be agesture to show that she had had enough of my questions. We walked outsidethrough the back door. I told her that I needed a long stick. She went directlyto a pile of firewood, but there were no long sticks. I asked her if she couldget me a couple of nails in order to join together two pieces of firewood. Welooked unsuccessfully all over the house for nails.As a final resort, I had to dislodge the longest stick I could find in thechicken coop that Pablito had built in the back. The stick, although it was abit flimsy, seemed suited for my purpose.Dona Soledad had not smiled or joked during our search. She seemed to be utterlyabsorbed in her task of helping me. Her concentration was so intense that I hadthe feeling she was wishing me to succeed.I walked to my car armed with the long stick and a shorter one from the pile offirewood. Dona Soledad stood by the front door.I began to tease the dog with the short stick in my right hand and at the sametime I tried to release the safety lock with the long one in my other hand. Thedog nearly bit my right hand and made me drop the short stick. The rage andpower of the enormous beast were so immense that I nearly lost the long one too.The dog was about to bite it in two when dona Soledad came to my aid. Poundingon the back window, she drew the dog's attention and he let go of it.Encouraged by her distracting maneuver I dove headfirst, slid across the lengthof the front seat, and managed to release the safety lock. I tried to pull backimmediately, but the dog charged toward me with all his might and actuallythrust his massive shoulders and front paws over the front seat before I hadtime to back out.I felt his paws on my shoulder. I cringed. I knew that he was going to maul me.The dog lowered his head to go in for the kill, but instead of biting me he hitthe steering wheel. I hurried out, and in one move climbed over the hood ontothe roof. I had goose bumps all over my body.I opened the right-hand door. I asked dona Soledad to hand me the long stick andwith it I pushed the lever to release the backrest from its straight position. Iconceived that if I teased the dog he would ram it forward, allowing himselfroom to get out of the car. But he did not move. He bit furiously on the stickinstead.At that moment dona Soledad jumped onto the roof and lay next to me. She wantedto help me tease the dog. I told her that she could not stay on the roof becausewhen the dog came out I was going to get in the car and drive away. I thankedher for her help, and said that she should go back in the house.She shrugged her shoulders, jumped down and went back to the door. I pushed downthe release again and with my cap I teased the dog. I snapped it around his eyesin front of his muzzle. The dog's fury was beyond anything I had seen, but hewould not leave the seat. Finally his massive jaws jerked the stick out of mygrip. I climbed down to retrieve it from underneath the car. Suddenly I hearddona Soledad screaming.\"Watch out! He's getting out! \"I glanced up at the car. The dog was squeezing himself over the seat. He hadgotten his hind paws caught in the steering wheel. Except for that, he wasalmost out.I dashed to the house and got inside just in time to avoid being run down bythat animal. His momentum was so powerful that he rammed against the door.As she secured the door with its iron bar dona Soledad said in a cackling voice,\"I told you it was useless.\"She cleared her throat and turned to look at me.\"Can you tie the dog with a rope?\" I asked.I was sure that she would give me a meaningless answer, but to my amazement shesaid that we should try everything; even luring the dog into the house andtrapping him there.Her idea appealed to me. I carefully opened the front door. The dog was nolonger there. I ventured out a bit more. There was no sight of him. My hope wasthat the dog had gone back to his corral. I was going to wait another instantbefore I made a dash for my car, when I heard a deep growl and saw the massivehead of the beast inside my car. He had crawled back onto the front seat.Dona Soledad was right.It was useless to try. A wave of sadness enveloped me.Somehow I knew my end was near. In a fit of sheer desperation I told donaSoledad that I was going to get a knife from the kitchen and kill the dog, or bekilled by him; and I would have done that had it not been that there was not asingle metal object in the entire house.\"Didn't the Nagual teach you to accept your fate?\" dona Soledad asked as shetrailed behind me. \"That one out there is no ordinary dog. That dog has power.He is a warrior. He will do what he has to do. Even kill you.\"I had a moment of uncontrollable frustration and grabbed her by the shouldersand growled. She did not seem surprised or affected by my sudden outburst. Sheturned her back to me and dropped her shawl to the floor. Her back was verystrong and beautiful.I had an irrepressible urge to hit her, but I ran my hand across her shouldersinstead. Her skin was soft and smooth. Her arms and shoulders were muscularwithout being big. She seemed to have a minimal layer of fat that rounded offher muscles and gave her upper body the appearance of smoothness; and yet when Ipushed on any part of it with the tips of my fingers I could feel the hardnessof unseen muscles below the smooth surface. I did not want to look at herbreasts.She walked to a roofed open area in back of the house that served as a kitchen.I followed her. She sat down on a bench and calmly washed her feet in a pail.While she was putting on her sandals, I went with great trepidation into a newouthouse that had been built in the back. She was standing by the door when Icame out.\"You like to talk,\" she said casually, leading me into her room. \"There is nohurry. Now we can talk forever.\"She picked up my writing pad from the top of her chest of drawers where she musthave placed it herself, and handed it to me with exaggerated care. Then shepulled up her bedspread and folded it neatly and put it on top of the same chestof drawers.I noticed then that the two chests were the color of the walls; yellowish white.The bed without the spread was pinkish red; more or less the color of the floor.The bedspread, on the other hand, was dark brown like the wood of the ceilingand the wood panels of the windows.\"Let's talk,\" she said, sitting comfortably on the bed after taking off hersandals.She placed her knees against her naked breasts. She looked like a young girl.Her aggressive and commandeering manner had subdued and changed into charm. Atthat moment she was the antithesis of what she had been earlier. I had to laughat the way she was urging me to write. She reminded me of don Juan.\"Now we have time,\" she said. \"The wind has changed. Didn't you notice it?\"I had. She said that the new direction of the wind was her own beneficialdirection and thus the wind had turned into her helper.\"What do you know about the wind, dona Soledad?\" I asked as I calmly sat down onthe foot of her bed.\"Only what the Nagual taught me,\" she said. \"Each one of us, women that is, hasa peculiar direction; a particular wind. Men don't. I am the north wind. When itblows, I am different. The Nagual said that a warrior can use her particularwind for whatever she wants. I used it to trim my body and remake it. Look atme! I am the north wind. Feel me when I come through the window.\"There was a strong wind blowing through the window which was strategicallyplaced to face the north.\"Why do you think men don't have a wind?\" I asked.She thought for a moment and then replied that the Nagual had never mentionedwhy.\"You wanted to know who made this floor,\" she said, wrapping her blanket aroundher shoulders. \"I made it myself. It took me four years to put it down. Now thisfloor is like myself.\"As she spoke I noticed that the converging lines in the floor were oriented tooriginate from the north. The room, however, was not perfectly aligned with thecardinal points. Thus her bed was at odd angles with the walls and so were thelines in the clay slabs.\"Why did you make the floor red, dona Soledad?\"\"That's my color. I am red, like red dirt. I got the red clay in the mountainsaround here. The Nagual told me where to look and he also helped me carry it;and so did everyone else. They all helped me.\"\"How did you fire the clay?\"\"The Nagual made me dig a pit. We filled it with firewood and then stacked upthe clay slabs with flat pieces of rock in between them. I closed the pit with alid of dirt and wire, and set the wood on fire. It burned for days.\"\"How did you keep the slabs from warping?\"\"I didn't. The wind did that, the north wind that blew while the fire was on.The Nagual showed me how to dig the pit so it would face the north and the northwind. He also made me leave four holes for the north wind to blow into the pit.Then he made me leave one hole in the center of the lid to let the smoke out.The wind made the wood burn for days. After the pit was cold again, I opened it,and began to polish and even out the slabs. It took me over a year to makeenough slabs to finish my floor.\"\"How did you figure out the design?\"\"The wind taught me that. When I made my floor the Nagual had already taught menot to resist the wind. He had showed me how to give in to my wind and let itguide me. It took him a long time to do that; years and years. I was a verydifficult silly old woman at first. He told me that himself and he was right.\"But I learned very fast. Perhaps because I'm old and no longer have anything tolose. In the beginning, what made it even more difficult for me was the fear Ihad. The mere presence of the Nagual made me stutter and faint. The Nagual hadthe same effect on everyone else. It was his fate to be so fearsome.\"She stopped talking and stared at me.\"The Nagual is not human,\" she said.\"What makes you say that?\"\"The Nagual is a devil from who knows what time.\"Her statements chilled me. I felt my heart pounding. She certainly could nothave found a better audience. I was intrigued to no end. I begged her to explainwhat she meant by that.\"His touch changed people,\" she said. \"You know that. He changed your body. Inyour case, you didn't even know that he was doing that. But he got into your oldbody. He put something in it. He did the same with me. He left something in meand that something took over. Only a devil can do that.\"Now I am the north wind and I fear nothing, and no one. But before he changedme I was a weak, ugly old woman who would faint at the mere mention of his name.Pablito, of course, was no help to me because he feared the Nagual more thandeath itself.\"One day the Nagual and Genaro came to the house when I was alone. I heard themby the door like prowling jaguars. I crossed myself. To me they were two demons,but I came out to see what I could do for them.\"They were hungry and I gladly fixed food for them. I had some thick bowls madeout of gourd, and I gave each man a bowl of soup. The Nagual didn't seem toappreciate the food. He didn't want to eat food prepared by such a weak womanand pretended to be clumsy and knocked the bowl off the table with a sweep ofhis arm.\"But the bowl, instead of turning over and spilling all over the floor, slidwith the force of the Nagual's blow and fell on my foot without spilling a drop.The bowl actually landed on my foot and stayed there until I bent over andpicked it up. I set it up on the table in front of him and told him that eventhough I was a weak woman and had always feared him, my food had good feelings.\"From that very moment the Nagual changed toward me. The fact that the bowl ofsoup fell on my foot and didn't spill proved to him that power had pointed meout to him. I didn't know that at the time and I thought that he changed towardme because he felt ashamed of having refused my food.\"I thought nothing of his change. I was still petrified and couldn't even lookhim in the eye. But he began to take more and more notice of me. He even broughtme gifts: a shawl, a dress, a comb and other things. That made me feel terrible.I was ashamed because I thought that he was a man looking for a woman. TheNagual had young girls. What would he want with an old woman like me?\"At first I didn't want to wear or even consider looking at his gifts, butPablito prevailed on me and I began to wear them. I also began to be even moreafraid of him and didn't want to be alone with him. I knew that he was adevilish man. I knew what he had done to his woman.\"I felt compelled to interrupt her. I told her that I had never known of a womanin don Juan's life.\"You know who I mean,\" she said.\"Believe me, dona Soledad, I don't.\"\"Don't give me that. You know that I'm talking about la Gorda.\"The only \"la Gorda\" I knew of was Pablito's sister; an enormously fat girlnicknamed Gorda; Fatso. I had had the feeling, although no one ever talked aboutit, that she was not really dona Soledad's daughter. I did not want to press herfor any more information. I suddenly remembered that the fat girl haddisappeared from the house, and nobody could or dared to tell me what hadhappened to her.\"One day I was alone in the front of the house,\" dona Soledad went on. \"I wascombing my hair in the sun with the comb that the Nagual had given me. I didn'trealize that he had arrived and was standing behind me. All of a sudden I felthis hands grabbing me by the chin. I heard him say very softly that I shouldn'tmove because my neck might break. He twisted my head to the left. Not all theway but a bit. I became very frightened and screamed, and tried to wriggle outof his grip, but he held my head firmly for a long, long time.\"When he let go of my chin, I fainted. I don't remember what happened then. WhenI woke up I was lying on the ground right here where I'm sitting now. The Nagualwas gone. I was so ashamed that I didn't want to see anyone, especially laGorda. For a long time I even thought that the Nagual had never twisted my neckand that I had had a nightmare.\"She stopped. I waited for an explanation of what had happened. She seemeddistracted; pensive perhaps.\"What exactly happened, dona Soledad?\" I asked, incapable of containing myself.\"Did he do something to you?\"\"Yes. He twisted my neck in order to change the direction of my eyes,\" she saidand laughed loudly at my look of surprise.\"I mean, did he...?\"\"Yes. He changed my direction,\" she went on, oblivious to my probes. \"He didthat to you and to all the others.\"\"That's true. He did that to me. But why do you think he did that?\"\"He had to. That is the most important thing to do.\"She was referring to a peculiar act that don Juan had deemed absolutelynecessary. I had never talked about it with anyone. In fact, I had almostforgotten about it. At the beginning of my apprenticeship, he once built twosmall fires in the mountains of northern Mexico. They were perhaps twenty feetapart. He made me stand another twenty feet away from them holding my body,especially my head, in a most relaxed and natural position.He then made me face one fire, and coming from behind me, he twisted my neck tothe left, and aligned my eyes, but not my shoulders, with the other fire. Heheld my head in that position for hours, until the fire was extinguished. Thenew direction was the southeast, or rather he had aligned the second fire in asoutheasterly direction. I had understood the whole affair as one of don Juan'sinscrutable peculiarities; one of his nonsensical rites.\"The Nagual said that all of us throughout our lives develop one direction tolook,\" she went on. \"That becomes the direction of the eyes of the spirit.Through the years that direction becomes overused, weak and unpleasant; andsince we are bound to that particular direction, we become weak and unpleasantourselves. The day the Nagual twisted my neck, and held it until I fainted outof fear, he gave me a new direction.\"\"What direction did he give you?\"\"Why do you ask that?\" she said with unnecessary force. \"Do you think thatperhaps the Nagual gave me a different direction?\"\"I can tell you the direction that he gave me,\" I said.\"Never mind,\" she snapped. \"He told me that himself.\"She seemed agitated. She changed position and lay on her stomach. My back hurtfrom writing. I asked her if I could sit on her floor and use the bed as atable. She stood up and handed me the folded bedspread to use as a cushion.\"What else did the Nagual do to you?\" I asked.\"After changing my direction, the Nagual really began to talk to me aboutpower,\" she said, lying down again. \"He mentioned things in a casual way atfirst because he didn't know exactly what to do with me. One day he took me fora short walking trip in the sierras. Then another day he took me on a bus to hishomeland in the desert. Little by little I became accustomed to going away withhim.\"\"Did he ever give you power plants?\"\"He gave me Mescalito once when we were in the desert. But since I was an emptywoman Mescalito refused me. I had a horrid encounter with him. It was then thatthe Nagual knew that he ought to acquaint me with the wind instead. That was, ofcourse, after he got an omen. He had said over and over that day, that althoughhe was a sorcerer that had learned to see, if he didn't get an omen, he had noway of knowing which way to go. He had already waited for days for a certainindication about me. But power didn't want to give it. In desperation, Isuppose, he introduced me to his guaje, and I saw Mescalito.\"I interrupted her. Her use of the word \"guaje,\" gourd, was confusing to me.Examined in the context of what she was telling me, the word had no meaning. Ithought that perhaps she was speaking metaphorically, or that gourd was aeuphemism.\"What is a guaje, dona Soledad?\"There was a look of surprise in her eyes. She paused before answering.\"Mescalito is the Nagual's guaje,\" she finally said.Her answer was even more confusing. I felt mortified by the fact that she reallyseemed concerned with making sense to me. When I asked her to explain further,she insisted that I knew everything myself. That was don Juan's favoritestratagem to foil my probes. I said to her that don Juan had told me thatMescalito was a deity, or force contained in the peyote buttons. To say thatMescalito was his gourd made absolutely no sense.\"The Nagual can acquaint you with anything through his gourd,\" she said after apause. \"That is the key to his power. Anyone can give you peyote, but only asorcerer, through his gourd, can acquaint you with Mescalito.\"She stopped talking and fixed her eyes on me. Her look was ferocious.\"Why do you have to make me repeat what you already know?\" she asked in an angrytone.I was completely taken aback by her sudden shift. A moment before she had beenalmost sweet.\"Never mind my changes of mood,\" she said, smiling again. \"I'm the north wind.I'm very impatient. All my life I never dared to speak my mind. Now I fear noone. I say what I feel. To meet with me you have to be strong.\"She slid closer to me on her stomach.\"Well, the Nagual acquainted me with the Mescalito that came out of his gourd,\"she went on. \"But he couldn't guess what would happen to me. He expectedsomething like your own meeting or Eligio's meeting with Mescalito. In bothcases he was at a loss and let his gourd decide what to do next. In both caseshis gourd helped him.\"With me it was different. Mescalito told him never to bring me around. TheNagual and I left that place in a great hurry. We went north instead of cominghome. We took a bus to go to Mexicali, but we got out in the middle of thedesert. It was very late. The sun was setting behind the mountains. The Nagualwanted to cross the road and go south on foot. We were waiting for some speedingcars to go by, when suddenly he tapped my shoulder and pointed toward the roadahead of us.\"I saw a spiral of dust. A gust of wind was raising dust on the side of theroad. We watched it move toward us. The Nagual ran across the road and the windenveloped me. It actually made me spin very gently and then it vanished. Thatwas the omen the Nagual was waiting for.\"From then on we went to the mountains or the desert for the purpose of seekingthe wind. The wind didn't like me at first because I was my old self. So theNagual endeavored to change me. He first made me build this room and this floor.Then he made me wear new clothes and sleep on a mattress instead of a straw mat.He made me wear shoes, and have drawers full of clothes. He forced me to walkhundreds of miles and taught me to be quiet. I learned very fast. He also mademe do strange things for no reason at all.\"One day, while we were in the mountains of his homeland, I listened to the windfor the first time. It came directly to my womb. I was lying on top of a flatrock and the wind twirled around me. I had already seen it that day whirlingaround the bushes, but this time it came over me and stopped. It felt like abird that had landed on my stomach. The Nagual had made me take off all myclothes. I was stark naked, but I was not cold because the wind was warming meup.\"\"Were you afraid, dona Soledad?\"\"Afraid? I was petrified. The wind was alive. It licked me from my head to mytoes; and then it got inside my whole body. I was like a balloon, and the windcame out of my ears and my mouth and other parts I don't want to mention. Ithought I was going to die, and I would've run away had it not been that theNagual held me to the rock. He spoke to me in my ear and calmed me down. I layquietly and let the wind do whatever it wanted with me. It was then that it toldme what to do.\"\"What to do with what?\"\"With my life, my things, my room, my feelings. It was not clear at first. Ithought it was me thinking. The Nagual said that all of us do that. When we arequiet, though, we realize that it is something else telling us things.\"\"Did you hear a voice?\"\"No. The wind moves inside the body of a woman. The Nagual says that that is sobecause women have wombs. Once it's inside the womb, the wind simply picks youup and tells you to do things. The more quiet and relaxed the woman is, thebetter the results. You may say that all of a sudden the woman finds herselfdoing things that she had no idea how to do.\"From that day on the wind came to me all the time. It spoke to me in my womband told me everything I wanted to know. The Nagual saw from the beginning thatI was the north wind. Other winds never spoke to me like that, although I hadlearned to distinguish them.\"\"How many kinds of winds are there?\"\"There are four winds, like there are four directions. That's, of course, forsorcerers and for whatever sorcerers do. Four is a power number for them. Thefirst wind is the breeze, the morning. It brings hope and brightness. It is theherald of the day. It comes and goes and gets into everything. Sometimes it ismild and unnoticeable. Other times it is nagging and bothersome.\"Another wind is the hard wind, either hot or cold or both. A midday wind.Blasting full of energy but also full of blindness. It breaks through doors andbrings down walls. A sorcerer must be terribly strong to tackle the hard wind.\"Then there is the cold wind of the afternoon. Sad and trying. A wind that wouldnever leave you in peace. It will chill you and make you cry. The Nagual saidthat there is such depth to it, though, that it is more than worthwhile to seekit.\"And at last there is the hot wind. It warms and protects and envelopseverything. It is a night wind for sorcerers. Its power goes together with thedarkness.\"Those are the four winds. They are also associated with the four directions.The breeze is the east. The cold wind is the west. The hot one is the south. Thehard wind is the north.\"The four winds also have personalities. The breeze is gay and sleek and shifty.The cold wind is moody and melancholy and always pensive. The hot wind is happyand abandoned and bouncy. The hard wind is energetic and commandeering andimpatient.\"The Nagual told me that the four winds are women. That is why female warriorsseek them. Winds and women are alike. That is also the reason why women arebetter than men. I would say that women learn faster if they cling to theirspecific wind.\"\"How can a woman know what her specific wind is?\"\"If the woman quiets down and is not talking to herself, her wind will pick herup; just like that.\"She made a gesture of grabbing.\"Does she have to lie naked?\"\"That helps; especially if she is shy. I was a fat old woman. I had never takenoff my clothes in my life. I slept in them and when I took a bath I always hadmy slip on. For me to show my fat body to the wind was like dying. The Nagualknew that and played it for all it was worth. He knew of the friendship of womenand the wind, but he introduced me to Mescalito because he was baffled by me.\"After turning my head that first terrible day, the Nagual found himself with meon his hands. He told me that he had no idea what to do with me. But one thingwas for sure, he didn't want a fat old woman snooping around his world. TheNagual said that he felt about me the way he felt about you. Baffled. Both of usshouldn't be here. You're not an Indian and I'm an old cow. We are both uselessif you come right down to it. And look at us. Something must have happened.\"A woman, of course, is much more supple than a man. A woman changes very easilywith the power of a sorcerer; especially with the power of a sorcerer like theNagual. A male apprentice, according to the Nagual, is extremely difficult.\"For example, you yourself haven't changed as much as la Gorda, and she startedher apprenticeship way after you did. A woman is softer and more gentle, andabove all a woman is like a gourd. She receives. But somehow a man commands morepower. The Nagual never agreed with that, though. He believed that women areunequaled; tops.\"He also believed that I felt men were better only because I am an empty woman.He must be right. I have been empty for so long that I can't remember what itfeels like to be complete. The Nagual said that if I ever become complete, Iwill change my feelings about it. But if he was right his Gorda would have doneas well as Eligio, and as you know, she hasn't.\"I could not follow the flow of her narrative because of her unstated assumptionthat I knew what she was referring to. In this case I had no idea what Eligio orla Gorda had done.\"In what way was la Gorda different from Eligio?\" I asked.She looked at me for a moment as if measuring something in me. Then she sat upwith her knees against her chest.\"The Nagual told me everything,\" she said briskly. \"The Nagual had no secretsfrom me. Eligio was the best. That's why he is not in the world now. He didn'treturn. In fact he was so good that he didn't have to jump from a precipice whenhis apprenticeship was over. He was like Genaro. One day while he was working inthe field, something came to him and took him away. He knew how to let go.\"I felt like asking her if I had really jumped into the abyss. I deliberated fora moment before going ahead with my question. After all, I had come to seePablito and Nestor to clarify that point. Any information I could get on thetopic from anyone involved in don Juan's world was indeed a bonus to me.She laughed at my question, as I had anticipated.\"You mean you don't know what you yourself did?\" she asked.\"It's too farfetched to be real,\" I said.\"That is the Nagual's world for sure. Not a thing in it is real. He himself toldme not to believe anything. But still the male apprentices have to jump; unlessthey are truly magnificent like Eligio.\"The Nagual took us- me and la Gorda- to that mountain and made us look down tothe bottom of it. There he showed us the kind of flying Nagual he was. But onlyla Gorda could follow him. She also wanted to jump into the abyss. The Nagualtold her that that was useless. He said female warriors have to do things morepainful and more difficult than that. He also told us that the jump was only forthe four of you; and that is what happened. The four of you jumped.\"She had said that the four of us had jumped, but I only knew of Pablito andmyself having done that. In light of her statements, I figured that don Juan anddon Genaro must have followed us. That did not seem odd to me. It was ratherpleasing and touching.\"What are you talking about?\" she asked after I had voiced my thoughts. \"I meantyou and the three apprentices of Genaro. You, Pablito and Nestor jumped on thesame day.\"\"Who is the other apprentice of don Genaro? I know only Pablito and Nestor?\"\"You mean that you didn't know that Benigno was Genaro's apprentice?\"\"No, I didn't.\"\"He was Genaro's oldest apprentice. He jumped before you did, and he jumped byhimself.\"Benigno was one of five Indian youths I had once found while roaming in theSonoran Desert with don Juan. They were in search of power objects. Don Juantold me that all of them were apprentices of sorcery.I struck up a peculiar friendship with Benigno in the few times I had seen himafter that day. He was from southern Mexico. I liked him very much.For some unknown reason he seemed to delight himself by creating a tantalizingmystery about his personal life. I could never find out who he was or what hedid. Every time I talked to him he baffled me with the disarming candor withwhich he evaded my probes. Once don Juan volunteered some information aboutBenigno, and said that he was very fortunate in having found a teacher and abenefactor. I took don Juan's statements as a casual remark that meant nothing.Dona Soledad had clarified a ten year old mystery for me.\"Why do you think don Juan never told me anything about Benigno?\"\"Who knows? He must've had a reason. The Nagual never did anythingthoughtlessly.\"I had to prop my aching back against her bed before resuming writing.\"Whatever happened to Benigno?\"\"He's doing fine. He's perhaps better off than anyone else. You'll see him. He'swith Pablito and Nestor. Right now they're inseparable. Genaro's brand is onthem. The same thing happened to the girls. They're inseparable because theNagual's brand is on them.\"I had to interrupt her again and ask her to explain what girls she was talkingabout.\"My girls,\" she said.\"Your daughters? I mean Pablito's sisters?\"\"They are not Pablito's sisters. They are the Nagual's apprentices.\"Her disclosure shocked me. Ever since I had met Pablito, years before, I hadbeen led to believe that the four girls who lived in his house were his sisters.Don Juan himself had told me so. I had a sudden relapse of the feeling ofdespair I had experienced all afternoon. Dona Soledad was not to be trusted. Shewas engineering something. I was sure that don Juan could not under anyconditions have misled me so grossly.Dona Soledad examined me with overt curiosity.\"The wind just told me that you don't believe what I'm telling you,\" she said,and laughed.\"The wind is right,\" I said dryly.\"The girls that you've seen over the years are the Nagual's. They were hisapprentices. Now that the Nagual is gone they are the Nagual himself; but theyare also my girls. Mine!\"\"You mean that you're not Pablito's mother and they are really your daughters?\"\"I mean that they are mine. The Nagual gave them to me for safekeeping. You arealways wrong because you rely on words to explain everything. Since I amPablito's mother and you heard that they were my girls, you figured out thatthey must be brother and sisters. The girls are my true babies. Pablito,although he's the child that came out of my womb, is my mortal enemy.\"My reaction to her statements was a mixture of revulsion and anger. I thoughtthat she was not only an aberrated woman, but a dangerous one. Somehow, part ofme had known that since the moment I had arrived.She watched me for a long time. To avoid looking at her I sat down on thebedspread again.\"The Nagual warned me about your weirdness,\" she said suddenly, \"but I couldn'tunderstand what he meant. Now I know. He told me to be careful and not to angeryou because you're violent. I'm sorry I was not as careful as I should've been.He also said that as long as you can write you could go to hell itself and noteven feel it. I haven't bothered you about that. Then he told me that you'resuspicious because words entangle you. I haven't bothered you there either. I'vebeen talking my head off trying not to entangle you.\"There was a silent accusation in her tone. I felt somehow embarrassed at beingannoyed with her.\"What you're telling me is very hard to believe,\" I said. \"Either you or donJuan has lied to me terribly.\"\"Neither of us has lied. You understand only what you want to. The Nagual saidthat that is a condition of your emptiness.\"The girls are the Nagual's children just like you and Eligio are his children.He made six children; four women and two men. Genaro made three men. There arenine altogether. One of them, Eligio, already made it. So now it is up to theeight of you to try.\"\"Where did Eligio go?\"\"He went to join the Nagual and Genaro.\"\"And where did the Nagual and Genaro go?\"\"You know where they went. You're just kidding me, aren't you?\"\"But that's the point, dona Soledad. I'm not kidding you.\"\"Then I will tell you. I can't deny you anything. The Nagual and Genaro wentback to the same place they came from; to the other world. When their time wasup, they simply stepped out into the darkness out there; and since they did notwant to come back, the darkness of the night swallowed them up\"I felt it was useless to probe her any further. I was ready to change thesubject, but she spoke first.\"You caught a glimpse of the other world when you jumped,\" she went on. \"Butmaybe the jump has confused you. Too bad. There is nothing that anyone can doabout it. It is your fate to be a man.\"Women are better than men in that sense. They don't have to jump into an abyss.Women have their own ways. They have their own abyss. Women menstruate. TheNagual told me that that was the door for them. During their period they becomesomething else. I know that that was the time when he taught my girls.\"It was too late for me. I'm too old so I really don't know what that door lookslike. But the Nagual insisted that the girls pay attention to everything thathappens to them during that time. He would take them during those days into themountains and stay with them there until they would see the crack between theworlds.\"The Nagual, since he had no qualms or fear about doing anything, pushed themwithout mercy so they could find out for themselves that there is a crack inwomen, a crack that they disguise very well. During their period, no matter howwell-made the disguise is, it falls away and women are bare. The Nagual pushedmy girls until they were half-dead to open that crack. They did it. He made themdo it, but it took them years.\"\"How did they become apprentices?\" I asked.\"Lidia was his first apprentice. He found her one morning when he had stopped ata disheveled hut in the mountains. The Nagual told me that there was no one insight and yet there had been omens calling him to that house since earlymorning. The breeze had bothered him terribly. He said that he couldn't evenopen his eyes every time he tried to walk away from that area.\"So when he found the house he knew that something was there. He looked under apile of straw and twigs, and found a girl. She was very ill. She could hardlytalk, but still she told him that she didn't need anyone to help her. She wasgoing to keep on sleeping there and if she didn't wake up anymore no one wouldlose a thing.\"The Nagual liked her spirit and talked to her in her language. He told her thathe was going to cure her, and take care of her until she was strong again. Sherefused. She was an Indian who had known only hardships and pain. She told theNagual that she had already taken all the medicine that her parents had givenher and nothing helped.\"The more she talked the more the Nagual understood that the omen had pointedher out to him in a most peculiar way. The omen was more like a command.\"The Nagual picked the girl up and put her on his shoulders, like a child, andbrought her to Genaro's place. Genaro made medicine for her. She couldn't openher eyes anymore. The lids were stuck together. They were swollen and had ayellowish crud on them. They were festering. The Nagual tended her until she waswell. He hired me to look after her and cook her meals. I helped her to get wellwith my food. She is my first baby. When she was well- and that took nearly ayear- the Nagual wanted to return her to her parents, but the girl refused to goand went with him instead.\"A short time after he had found Lidia, while she was still sick and in my care,the Nagual found you. You were brought to him by a man he had never seen beforein his life. The Nagual saw that the man's death was hovering above his head,and he found it very odd that the man would point you out to him at such a time.You made the Nagual laugh and right away the Nagual set a test for you. Hedidn't take you. He told you to come and find him. He has tested you ever sincelike he has tested no one else. He said that that was your path.\"For three years he had only two apprentices, Lidia and you. Then one day whilehe was visiting his friend Vicente, a curer from the north. Some people broughtin a crazy girl; a girl who did nothing else but cry. The people mistook theNagual for Vicente, and placed the girl in his hands. The Nagual told me thatthe girl ran to him and clung to him as if she knew him.\"The Nagual told her parents that they had to leave her with him. They wereworried about the cost but the Nagual assured them that it would be free. Isuppose that the girl was such a pain in the ass to them that they didn't mindgetting rid of her.\"The Nagual brought her to me. That was hell! She was truly crazy. That wasJosefina. It took the Nagual years to cure her; but even to this day she'scrazier than a bat. She was, of course, crazy about the Nagual, and there was aterrible fight between Lidia and Josefina. They hated each other. But I likedthem both.\"But the Nagual, when he saw that they couldn't get along, became very firm withthem. As you know the Nagual can't get mad at anyone. So he scared them half todeath. One day Lidia got mad and left. She had decided to find herself a younghusband. On the road she found a tiny chicken. It had just been hatched and waslost in the middle of the road. Lidia picked it up, and since she was in adeserted area with no houses around, she figured that the chicken belonged to noone.\"She put it inside her blouse, in between her breasts to keep it warm. Lidiatold me that she ran and in doing so the little chicken began to move to herside. She tried to bring him back to the front, but she couldn't catch him. Thechicken ran very fast around her sides and her back inside her blouse. Thechicken's feet tickled her at first, and then they drove her crazy. When sherealized that she couldn't get him out, she came back to me screaming out of hermind, and told me to get the darn thing out of her blouse. I undressed her, butthat was to no avail. There was no chicken at all, and yet she still felt itsfeet on her skin going around and around.\"The Nagual came over then and told her that only when she let go of her oldself would the chicken stop running. Lidia was crazy for three days and threenights. The Nagual told me to tie her up. I fed her and cleaned her and gave herwater. On the fourth day she became very peaceful and calm. I untied her and sheput on her clothes; and when she was dressed again as she had been the day sheran away, the little chicken came out. She took him in her hand and petted andthanked him, and returned him to the place where she had found him. I walkedwith her part of the way.\"From that time on Lidia never bothered anyone. She accepted her fate. TheNagual is her fate. Without him she would have been dead. So, what was the pointof trying to refuse or mold things which can only be accepted?\"Josefina went off next. She was already afraid of what happened to Lidia, butshe soon forgot about it. One Sunday afternoon when she was coming back to thehouse, a dry leaf got stuck in the threads of her shawl. Her shawl was looselywoven. She tried to pick out the small leaf, but she was afraid of ruining hershawl.\"So when she came into the house she immediately tried to loosen it, but therewas no way. It was stuck. Josefina, in a fit of anger, clutched the shawl andthe leaf, and crumbled it inside her hand. She figured that small pieces wouldbe easier to pick out. I heard a maddening scream and Josefina fell to theground. I ran to her and found that she couldn't open her hand. The leaf had cuther hand to shreds as if it were pieces of a razor blade.\"Lidia and I helped her and nursed her for seven days. Josefina was morestubborn than anyone else. She nearly died. At the end she managed to open herhand, but only after she had, in her own mind, resolved to drop her old ways.\"She still gets pains in her body from time to time, especially in her hand, dueto the ugly disposition that still returns to her. The Nagual told both of themthat they shouldn't count on their victory because it's a lifetime struggle thateach of us wages against our old selves.\"Lidia and Josefina never fought again. I don't think they like each other, butthey certainly get along. I love those two the most. They have been with me allthese years. I know that they love me too.\"\"What about the other two girls? Where do they fit?\"\"A year later Elena came. She is la Gorda. She was by far in the worst conditionyou could imagine. She weighed two hundred and twenty pounds. She was adesperate woman. Pablito had given her shelter in his shop. She did laundry andironing to support herself.\"The Nagual came one night to get Pablito, and found the fat girl working whilea circle of moths flew over her head. He said that the moths had made a perfectcircle for him to watch. He saw that the woman was near the end of her life, yetthe moths must have had all the confidence in the world in order for them togive him such an omen. The Nagual acted fast and took her with him.\"She did fine for a while, but the bad habits that she had learned were too deepand she couldn't give them up. So one day the Nagual sent for the wind to helpher. It was a matter of helping her or finishing her off. The wind began to blowon her until it drove her out of the house. She was alone that day and no onesaw what was happening. The wind pushed her over hills and into ravines untilshe fell into a ditch; a hole in the ground like a grave. The wind kept herthere for days. When the Nagual finally found her, she had managed to stop thewind but she was too weak to walk.\"\"How did the girls manage to stop whatever was acting upon them?\"\"Well, in the first place what was acting upon them was the gourd that theNagual carried tied to his belt.\"\"And what is in the gourd?\"\"The allies that the Nagual carries with him. He said that the ally is funneledthrough his gourd. Don't ask me any more because I know nothing more about theally.\"All I can tell you is that the Nagual commands two allies and makes them helphim. In the case of my girls the ally backed down when they were ready tochange. For them, of course, it was a case of either change or death. But that'sthe case with all of us, one way or another. And la Gorda changed more thananyone else. She was empty, in fact more empty than I, but she worked her spirituntil she became power itself.\"I don't like her. I'm afraid of her. She knows me. She gets inside me and myfeelings, and that bothers me. But no one can do anything to her because shenever lets her guard down. She doesn't hate me, but she thinks I am an evilwoman. She may be right. I think that she knows me too well; and I'm not asimpeccable as I want to be\"But the Nagual told me not to worry about my feelings toward her. She is likeEligio. The world no longer touches her.\"\"What did the Nagual do to her that was so special?\"\"He taught her things he never taught anyone else. He never pampered her oranything like that. He trusted her. She knows everything about everybody. TheNagual also told me everything except things about her. Maybe that's why I don'tlike her. The Nagual told her to be my jailer. Wherever I go I find her. Sheknows whatever I do. Right now, for instance, I wouldn't be surprised if sheshows up.\"\"Do you think she would?\"\"I doubt it. Tonight, the wind is with me.\"\"What is she supposed to do? Does she have a special task?\"\"I've told you enough about her. I'm afraid that if I keep on talking about her,she will notice me from wherever she is and I don't want that to happen.\"\"Tell me, then, about the others.\"\"Some years after he found la Gorda, the Nagual found Eligio. He told me that hehad gone with you to his homeland. Eligio came to see you because he was curiousabout you.\"The Nagual didn't notice him. He had known him since he was a kid. But onemorning, as the Nagual walked to the house where you were waiting for him, hebumped into Eligio on the road. They walked together for a short distance andthen a dried piece of cholla got stuck on the tip of Eligio's left shoe. Hetried to kick it loose but its thorns were like nails. They had gone deep intothe sole of the shoe. The Nagual said that Eligio pointed up to the sky with hisfinger and shook his foot; and the cholla came off like a bullet and went upinto the air.\"Eligio thought it was a big joke and laughed; but the Nagual knew that he hadpower, although Eligio himself didn't even suspect it. That is why, with notrouble at all, he became the perfect, impeccable warrior.\"It was my good fortune that I got to know him. The Nagual thought that both ofus were alike in one thing. Once we hook onto something, we don't let go of it.The good fortune of knowing Eligio was a fortune that I shared with no one else;not even with la Gorda. She met Eligio but didn't really get to know him; justlike yourself. The Nagual knew from the beginning that Eligio was exceptionaland he isolated him. He knew that you and the girls were on one side of thecoin, and Eligio was by himself on the other side. The Nagual and Genaro wereindeed very fortunate to have found him.\"I first met him when the Nagual brought him over to my house. Eligio didn't getalong with my girls. They hated him and feared him too. But he was thoroughlyindifferent. The world didn't touch him.\"The Nagual didn't want you, in particular, to have much to do with Eligio. TheNagual said that you are the kind of sorcerer one should stay away from. He saidthat your touch doesn't soothe, it spoils instead. He told me that your spirittakes prisoners. He was somehow revolted by you, and at the same time he likedyou. He said that you were crazier than Josefina when he found you and that youstill are.\"It was an unsettling feeling to hear someone else telling me what don Juanthought of me. At first I tried to disregard what dona Soledad was saying, butthen I felt utterly stupid and out of place trying to protect my ego.\"He bothered with you,\" she went on, \"because he was commanded by power to doso. And he, being the impeccable warrior he was, yielded to his master andgladly did what power told him to do with you.\"There was a pause. I was aching to ask her more about don Juan's feelings aboutme. I asked her to tell me about her other girl instead.\"A month after he found Eligio, the Nagual found Rosa,\" she said. \"Rosa was thelast one. Once he found her he knew that his number was complete.\"\"How did he find her?\"\"He had gone to see Benigno in his homeland. He was approaching the house whenRosa came out from the thick bushes on the side of the road, chasing a pig thathad gotten loose and was running away. The pig ran too fast for Rosa.\"She bumped into the Nagual and couldn't catch up with the pig. She then turnedagainst the Nagual and began to yell at him. He made a gesture to grab her andshe was ready to fight him. She insulted him and dared him to lay a hand on her.The Nagual liked her spirit immediately but there was no omen. The Nagual saidthat he waited a moment before walking away, and then the pig came running backand stood beside him.\"That was the omen. Rosa put a rope around the pig. The Nagual asked herpoint-blank if she was happy in her job. She said no. She was a live-in servant.The Nagual asked her if she would go with him and she said that if it was whatshe thought it was for, the answer was no.\"The Nagual said it was for work, and she wanted to know how much he would pay.He gave her a figure and then she asked what kind of work it was. The Nagualsaid that it was to work with him in the tobacco fields of Veracruz. She toldhim then that she had been testing him. If he would have said he wanted her towork as a maid, she would have known that he was a liar because he looked likesomeone who had never had a home in his life.\"The Nagual was delighted with her and told her that if she wanted to get out ofthe trap she was in she should come to Benigno's house before noon. He also toldher that he would wait no longer than twelve. If she came, she had to beprepared for a difficult life and plenty of work. She asked him how far was theplace of the tobacco fields. The Nagual said three days' ride in a bus.\"Rosa said that if it was that far she would certainly be ready to go as soon asshe got the pig back in his pen. And she did just that. She came here andeveryone liked her. She was never mean or bothersome. The Nagual didn't have toforce her or trick her into anything. She doesn't like me at all, and yet shetakes care of me better than anyone else. I trust her, and yet I don't like herat all; and when I leave I will miss her the most. Can you beat that?\"I saw a flicker of sadness in her eyes. I could not sustain my distrust. Shewiped her eyes with a casual movement of her hand.There was a natural break in the conversation at that point. It was getting darkby then and writing was very difficult; besides I had to go to the bathroom. Sheinsisted that I use the outhouse before she did as the Nagual himself would havedone.Afterward, she brought two round tubs the size of a child's bathtub, filled themhalf-full with warm water, and added some green leaves after mashing themthoroughly with her hands. She told me in an authoritative tone to wash myselfin one of the tubs while she did the same in the other. The water had an almostperfumed smell. It caused a ticklish sensation. It felt like a mild menthol onmy face and arms.We went back to her room. She put my writing gear, which I had left on her bed,on top of one of her chests of drawers. The windows were open and there wasstill light. It must have been close to seven.Dona Soledad lay on her back. She was smiling at me. I thought that she was thepicture of warmth. But at the same time and in spite of her smile, her eyes gaveout a feeling of ruthlessness and unbending force.I asked her how long she had been with don Juan as his woman or apprentice. Shemade fun of my cautiousness in labeling her. Her answer was seven years. Shereminded me then that I had not seen her for five. I had been convinced up tothat point that I had seen her two years before. I tried to remember the lasttime, but I could not.She told me to lie down next to her. I knelt on the bed by her side. In a verysoft voice she asked me if I was afraid. I said no, which was the truth. Therein her room, at that moment, I was being confronted by an old response of minewhich had manifested itself countless times; a mixture of curiosity and suicidalindifference.Almost in a whisper she said that she had to be impeccable with me and tell methat our meeting was crucial for both of us. She said that the Nagual had givenher direct and detailed orders of what to do. As she talked I could not helplaughing at her tremendous effort to sound like don Juan. I listened to herstatements and could predict what she would say next.Suddenly she sat up. Her face was a few inches from mine. I could see her whiteteeth shining in the semidarkness of the room. She put her arms around me in anembrace and pulled me on top of her.My mind was very clear, and yet something was leading me deeper and deeper intoa sort of morass. I was experiencing myself as something I had no conception of.Suddenly I knew that I had, somehow, been feeling her feelings all along. Shewas the strange one. She had mesmerized me with words. She was a cold, oldwoman. And her designs were not those of youth and vigor, in spite of hervitality and strength.I knew then that don Juan had not turned her head in the same direction as mine.That thought would have been ridiculous in any other context. Nonetheless, atthat moment I took it as a true insight. A feeling of alarm swept through mybody. I wanted to get out of her bed, but there seemed to be an extraordinaryforce around me that kept me fixed; incapable of moving away. I was paralyzed.She must have felt my realization. All of a sudden, she pulled the band thattied her hair and in one swift movement she wrapped it around my neck. I feltthe tension of the band on my skin, but somehow it did not seem real.Don Juan had always said to me that our great enemy is the fact that we neverbelieve what is happening to us. At the moment dona Soledad was wrapping thecloth like a noose around my throat, I knew what he meant. But even after I hadhad that intellectual reflection, my body did not react. I remained flaccid,almost indifferent to what seemed to be my death.I felt the exertion of her arms and shoulders as she tightened the band aroundmy neck. She was choking me with great force and expertise. I began to gasp. Hereyes stared at me with a maddening glare. I knew then that she intended to killme.Don Juan had said that when we finally realize what is going on, it is usuallytoo late to turn back. He contended that it is always the intellect that foolsus because it receives the message first; but rather than giving it credence andacting on it immediately, it dallies with it instead.I heard then, or perhaps I felt, a snapping sound at the base of my neck rightbehind my windpipe. I thought that she had cracked my neck. My ears buzzed andthen they tingled. I experienced an exceptional clarity of hearing. I thoughtthat I must be dying.I loathed my incapacity to do anything to defend myself. I could not even move amuscle to kick her. I was unable to breathe anymore. My body shivered, andsuddenly I stood up and was free, out of her deadly grip.I looked down on the bed. I seemed to be looking down from the ceiling. I saw mybody motionless and limp on top of hers. I saw horror in her eyes. I wanted herto let go of the noose. I had a fit of wrath for having been so stupid and hither smack on the forehead with my fist.She shrieked and held her head and then passed out, but before she did I caughta fleeting glimpse of a phantasmagoric scene. I saw dona Soledad being hurledout of the bed by the force of my blow. I saw her running toward the wall andhuddling up against it like a frightened child.The next impression I had was of having a terrible difficulty in breathing. Myneck hurt. My throat seemed to have dried up so intensely that I could notswallow. It took me a long time to gather enough strength to get up.I then examined dona Soledad. She was lying unconscious on the bed. She had anenormous red lump on her forehead. I got some water and splashed it on her face,the way don Juan had always done with me.When she regained consciousness I made her walk, holding her by the armpits. Shewas soaked in perspiration. I applied towels with cold water on her forehead.She threw up, and I was almost sure she had a brain concussion. She wasshivering.I tried to pile clothes and blankets over her for warmth but she took off allher clothes and turned her body to face the wind. She asked me to leave heralone and said that if the wind changed direction, it would be a sign that shewas going to get well. She held my hand in a sort of brief handshake, and toldme that it was fate that had pitted us against each other.\"I think one of us was supposed to die tonight,\" she said.\"Don't be silly. You're not finished yet,\" I said and really meant it.Something made me feel confident that she was all right. I went outside, pickedup a stick, and walked to my car. The dog growled. He was still curled up on theseat. I told him to get out. He meekly jumped out. There was something differentabout him. I saw his enormous shape trotting away in the semidarkness. He wentto his corral.I was free. I sat in the car for a moment to deliberate. No, I was not free.Something was pulling me back into the house. I had unfinished business there. Iwas no longer afraid of dona Soledad.In fact, an extraordinary indifference had taken possession of me. I felt thatshe had given me, deliberately or unconsciously, a supremely important lesson.Under the horrendous pressure of her attempt to kill me, I had actually actedupon her from a level that would have been inconceivable under normalcircumstances.I had nearly been strangled. Something in that confounded room of hers hadrendered me helpless, and yet I had extricated myself. I could not imagine whathad happened. Perhaps it was as don Juan had always maintained; that all of ushave an extra potential; something which is there but rarely gets to be used. Ihad actually hit dona Soledad from a phantom position.I took my flashlight from the car, went back into the house, lit all thekerosene lanterns I could find and sat down at the table in the front room towrite. Working relaxed me.Toward dawn dona Soledad stumbled out of her room. She could hardly keep herbalance. She was completely naked. She became ill, and collapsed by the door. Igave her some water, and tried to cover her with a blanket. She refused it. Ibecame concerned with the possibility of her losing body heat. She muttered thatshe had to be naked if she expected the wind to cure her.She made a plaster of mashed leaves, applied it to her forehead, and fixed it inplace with her turban. She wrapped a blanket around her body and came to thetable where I was writing, and sat down facing me. Her eyes were red. She lookedtruly sick.\"There is something I must tell you,\" she said in a weak voice. \"The Nagual setme up to wait for you. I had to wait even if it took twenty years. He gave meinstructions on how to entice you and steal your power. He knew that sooner orlater you had to come to see Pablito and Nestor, so he told me to use thatopportunity to bewitch you and take everything you have.\"The Nagual said that if I lived an impeccable life, my power would bring youhere when there would be no one else in the house. My power did that. Today youcame when everybody was gone. My impeccable life had helped me. All that wasleft for me to do was to take your power and then kill you.\"\"But why would you want to do such a horrible thing?\"\"Because I need your power for my own journey. The Nagual had to set it up thatway. You had to be the one. After all, I really don't know you. You mean nothingto me. So why shouldn't I take something I need so desperately from someone whodoesn't count at all? Those were the Nagual's very words.\"\"Why would the Nagual want to hurt me? You yourself said that he worried aboutme.\"\"What I've done to you tonight has nothing to do with what he feels for you ormyself. This is only between the two of us. There have been no witnesses to whattook place today between the two of us, because both of us are part of theNagual himself.\"But you in particular have received and kept something of him that I don'thave; something that I need desperately; the special power that he gave you. TheNagual said that he had given something to each of his six children.\"I can't reach Eligio. I can't take it from my girls. So that leaves you as myprey.\"I made the power the Nagual gave me grow, and in growing it changed my body.You made your power grow too. I wanted that power from you and for that I had tokill you. The Nagual said that even if you didn't die, you would fall under myspell and become my prisoner for life if I wanted it so. Either way, your powerwas going to be mine.\"\"But how could my death benefit you?\"\"Not your death but your power. I did it because I need a boost. Without it Iwill have a hellish time on my journey. I don't have enough guts. That's why Idislike la Gorda. She's young and has plenty of guts. I'm old and have secondthoughts and doubts. If you want to know the truth, the real struggle is betweenPablito and myself. He is my mortal enemy, not you. The Nagual said that yourpower could make my journey easier and help me get what I need.\"\"How on earth can Pablito be your enemy?\"\"When the Nagual changed me, he knew what would eventually happen. First of all,he set me up so my eyes would face the north. And although you and my girls arethe same, I am the opposite of you people. I go in a different direction.Pablito, Nestor and Benigno are with you. The direction of their eyes is thesame as yours. All of you will go together toward Yucatan.\"Pablito is my enemy, not because his eyes were set in the opposite direction,but because he is my son. This is what I had to tell you even though you don'tknow what I am talking about. I have to enter into the other world where theNagual is now- where Genaro and Eligio are now- even if I have to destroyPablito to do that.\"\"What are you saying, dona Soledad? You're crazy!\"\"No, I am not. There is nothing more important for us living beings than toenter into that world. I will tell you that for me that is true. To get to thatworld, I live the way the Nagual taught me. Without the hope of that world, I amnothing; nothing. I was a fat old cow.\"Now that hope gives me a guide; a direction; and even if I can't take yourpower, I still have my purpose.\"She rested her head on the table using her arms as a pillow. The force of herstatements had numbed me. I had not understood what exactly she had meant, but Icould almost empathize with her plea- although it was the strangest thing I hadyet heard from her that night. Her purpose was a warrior's purpose, in donJuan's style and terminology. I never knew, however, that one had to destroypeople in order to fulfill it.She lifted up her head and looked at me with half-closed eyelids.\"At the beginning everything worked fine for me today,\" she said. \"I was a bitscared when you drove up. I had waited years for that moment. The Nagual told methat you like women. He said you are an easy prey for them, so I played you fora quick finish. I figured that you would go for it.\"The Nagual had taught me how I should grab you at the moment when you are theweakest. I was leading you to that moment with my body. But you becamesuspicious. I was too clumsy.\"I had taken you to my room, as the Nagual told me to do, so the lines of myfloor would entrap you and make you helpless. But you fooled my floor by likingit and by watching its lines intently. It had no power as long as your eyes wereon its lines. Your body knew what to do. Then you scared my floor, yelling theway you did. Sudden noises like that are deadly; especially the voice of asorcerer. The power of my floor died out like a flame. I knew it, but youdidn't.\"You were about to leave then so I had to stop you. The Nagual had shown me howto use my hand to grab you. I tried to do that, but my power was low. My floorwas scared. Your eyes had numbed its lines. No one else has ever laid eyes onthem.\"So I failed in my attempt to grab your neck. You got out of my grip before Ihad time to squeeze you. I knew then that you were slipping away and I tried onefinal attack. I used the key the Nagual said would affect you the most; fright.I frightened you with my shrieks and that gave me enough power to subdue you.\"I thought I had you, but my stupid dog got excited. He's stupid and knocked meoff of you when I had you almost under my spell. As I see it now, perhaps my dogwas not so stupid after all. Maybe he noticed your double, and charged againstit; but knocked me over instead.\"\"You said he wasn't your dog.\"\"I lied. He was my trump card. The Nagual taught me that I should always have atrump card; an unsuspected trick. Somehow, I knew that I might need my dog. WhenI took you to see my friend, it was really him. The coyote is my girls' friend.\"I wanted my dog to sniff you. When you ran into the house I had to be roughwith him. I pushed him inside your car; making him yell with pain. He's too bigand could hardly fit over the seat.\"I told him right then to maul you to shreds. I knew that if you had been badlybitten by my dog, you would have been helpless and I could have finished you offwithout any trouble. You escaped again, but you couldn't leave the house. I knewthen that I had to be patient and wait for the darkness. Then the wind changeddirection and I was sure of my success.\"The Nagual had told me that he knew without a doubt that you would like me as awoman. It was a matter of waiting for the right moment. The Nagual said that youwould kill yourself once you realized I had stolen your power. But in case Ifailed to steal it, or in case you didn't kill yourself, or in case I didn'twant to keep you alive as my prisoner, I should then use my headband to chokeyou to death.\"He even showed me the place where I had to throw your carcass: a bottomlesspit, a crack in the mountains, not too far from here, where goats alwaysdisappear.\"The Nagual never mentioned your awesome side, though. I've told you that one ofus was supposed to die tonight. I didn't know it was going to be me. The Nagualgave me the feeling that I would win. How cruel of him not to tell me everythingabout you.\"\"Think of me, dona Soledad. I knew even less than you did.\"\"It's not the same. The Nagual prepared me for years for this. I knew everydetail. You were in my bag. The Nagual even showed me the leaves I should alwayskeep fresh and handy to make you numb. I put them in the tub as if they were forfragrance. You didn't notice that I used another kind of leaf for my tub. Youfell for everything I had prepared for you. And yet your awesome side won in theend.\"\"What do you mean my awesome side?\"\"The one that hit me and will kill me tonight. Your horrendous double that cameout to finish me. I will never forget it, and if I live, which I doubt, I willnever be the same.\"\"Did it look like me?\"\"It was you, of course, but not as you look now. I can't really say what itlooked like. When I want to think about it I get dizzy.\"I told her about my fleeting perception that she had left her body with theimpact of my blow. I intended to prod her with the account. It seemed to me thatthe reason behind the whole event had been to force us to draw from sources thatare ordinarily barred to us.I had positively given her a dreadful blow. I had caused profound damage to herbody, and yet I could not have done it myself. I did feel I had hit her with myleft fist. The enormous red lump on her forehead attested to that, yet I had noswelling in my knuckles or the slightest pain or discomfort in them. A blow ofthat magnitude could even have broken my hand.Upon hearing my description of how I had seen her huddling against the wall, shebecame thoroughly desperate. I asked her if she had had any inkling of what Ihad seen; such as a sensation of leaving her body, or a fleeting perception ofthe room.\"I know now that I am doomed,\" she said. \"Very few survive a touch of thedouble. If my soul has left already, I won't survive. I'll get weaker and weakeruntil I die.\"Her eyes had a wild glare. She raised herself and seemed to be on the verge ofstriking me, but she slumped back.\"You've taken my soul,\" she said. \"You must have it in your pouch now. Why didyou have to tell me, though?\"I swore to her that I had had no intentions of hurting her; that I had acted inwhatever form only in self-defense and therefore I bore no malice toward her.\"If you don't have my soul in your pouch, it's even worse,\" she said. \"It mustbe roaming aimlessly around. I will never get it back, then.\"Dona Soledad seemed to be void of energy. Her voice became weaker. I wanted herto go and lie down. She refused to leave the table.\"The Nagual said that if I failed completely I should then give you hismessage,\" she said. \"He told me to tell you that he had replaced your body along time ago. You are himself now.\"\"What did he mean by that?\"\"He's a sorcerer. He entered into your old body and replaced its luminosity. Nowyou shine like the Nagual himself. You're not your father's son anymore. You arethe Nagual himself.\"Dona Soledad stood up. She was groggy. She appeared to want to say somethingelse but had trouble vocalizing. She walked to her room. I helped her to thedoor. She did not want me to enter. She dropped the blanket that covered her andlay down on her bed.She asked in a very soft voice if I would go to a hill a short distance away andwatch from there to see if the wind was coming. She added in a most casualmanner that I should take her dog with me. Somehow her request did not soundright. I said that I would climb up on the roof and look from there. She turnedher back to me and said that the least I could do for her was to take her dog tothe hill so that he could lure the wind.I became very irritated with her. Her room in the darkness gave out a most eeriefeeling. I went into the kitchen and got two lanterns and brought them back withme. At the sight of the light she screamed hysterically. I let out a yellmyself, but for a different reason. When the light hit the room I saw the floorcurled up, like a cocoon, around her bed. My perception was so fleeting that thenext instant I could have sworn that the shadow of the wire protective masks ofthe lanterns had created that ghastly scene.My phantom perception made me furious. I shook her by the shoulders. She weptlike a child and promised not to try any more of her tricks. I placed thelanterns on the chest of drawers and she fell asleep instantly.By midmorning the wind had changed. I felt a strong gust coming through thenorth window. Around noon dona Soledad came out again. She seemed a bit wobbly.The redness in her eyes had disappeared and the swelling of her forehead haddiminished. There was hardly any visible lump.I felt that it was time for me to leave. I told her that although I had writtendown the message that she had given me from don Juan, it did not clarifyanything.\"You're not your father's son anymore. You are now the Nagual himself,\" shesaid.There was something truly incongruous about me. A few hours before I had beenhelpless and dona Soledad had actually tried to kill me. But at that moment whenshe was speaking to me, I had forgotten the horror of that event.And yet, there was another part of me that could spend days mulling overmeaningless confrontations with people concerning my personality or my work.That part seemed to be the real me; the me that I had known all my life.The me, however, who had gone through a bout with death that night and thenforgotten about it was not real. It was me and yet it was not. In the light ofsuch incongruities, don Juan's claims seemed to be less farfetched, but stillunacceptable.Dona Soledad seemed absentminded. She smiled peacefully.\"Oh, they are here!\" she said suddenly. \"How fortunate for me. My girls arehere. Now they'll take care of me.\"She seemed to have had a turn for the worse. She looked as strong as ever, buther behavior was more disassociated. My fears mounted. I did not know whether toleave her there or take her to a hospital in the city several hundred milesaway.All of a sudden, she jumped up like a little child and ran out the front doorand down the driveway toward the main road. Her dog ran after her. I hurriedlygot in my car in order to catch up with her. I had to drive down the path inreverse since there was no space to turn around. As I approached the road, I sawthrough the back window that dona Soledad was surrounded by four young women. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"2. The Little Sisters Dona Soledad seemed to be explaining something to the four women who surroundedher. She moved her arms in dramatic gestures and held her head in her hands. Itwas obvious she was telling them about me.I drove up the driveway to where I had been parked before. I intended to waitfor them there. I deliberated whether to remain in the car or to sit casually onthe left fender. I opted to stand by the car door; ready to jump in and driveaway if something like the events of the previous day were going to be repeated.I was very tired. I had not slept a wink for over twenty-four hours. My plan wasto disclose to the young women as much as I could about the incident with donaSoledad so they could take the necessary steps to aid her; and then I wouldleave. Their presence had brought about a definite change. Everything seemed tobe charged with new vigor and energy. I felt the change when I saw dona Soledadsurrounded by them.Dona Soledad's revelation that they were don Juan's apprentices had given themsuch a tantalizing appeal that I could hardly wait to meet them. I wondered ifthey were like dona Soledad. She had said that they were like myself and that wewere going in the same direction. That could be easily interpreted in a positivesense. I wanted to believe that more than anything else.Don Juan used to call them \"las hermanitas,\" the little sisters, a mostbefitting name at least for the two I had met; Lidia and Rosa; two wispy,pixie-like, charming young women. I figured that they must have been in theirearly twenties when I had first met them, although Pablito and Nestor alwaysrefused to talk about their ages.The other two, Josefina and Elena, were a total mystery to me. I used to heartheir names being mentioned from time to time, always in some unfavorablecontext. I had deduced from passing remarks made by don Juan that they weresomehow freakish, one was crazy and the other obese; thus they were kept inisolation.Once I bumped into Josefina as I walked into the house with don Juan. Heintroduced me to her, but she covered her face and ran away before I had time togreet her. Another time I caught Elena washing clothes. She was enormous. Ithought that she must be suffering from a glandular disorder. I said hello toher but she did not turn around. I never saw her face.After the buildup that dona Soledad had given them with her disclosure, I feltdriven to talk with the mysterious \"hermanitas,\" and at the same time I wasalmost afraid of them.I casually looked down the driveway, bracing myself to meet all of them at once.The driveway was deserted. There was no one approaching although only a minutebefore they had been no more than thirty yards from the house.I climbed up on the roof of the car to look. There was no one coming, not eventhe dog. I panicked. I slid down and was about to jump in the car and drive awaywhen I heard someone say, \"Hey, look who's here.\"I quickly turned around to face two girls who had just stepped out of the house.I deduced that all of them must have run ahead of me and entered the housethrough the back door. I sighed with relief.The two young girls came toward me. I had to admit to myself that I had neverreally noticed them before. They were beautiful, dark and extremely lean, butwithout being skinny. Their long black hair was braided. They wore plain skirts,blue denim jackets and low-heeled soft-soled brown shoes. They were bareleggedand their legs were shapely and muscular. They must have been about five feetthree or five feet four inches. They seemed to be very physical. They moved withgreat prowess. One of them was Lidia. The other was Rosa.I greeted them, and then in unison they initiated a hand-shake. They flanked me.They looked healthy and vigorous. I asked them to help me get the packages outof the trunk. As we were carrying them into the house, I heard a deep growl sodeep and near that it seemed more like a lion's roar.\"What was that?\" I asked Lidia.\"Don't you know?\" she asked with a tone of disbelief.\"It must be the dog,\" Rosa said as they ran into the house, practically draggingme with them.We placed the packages on the table and sat on two benches. Both girls werefacing me. I told them that dona Soledad was very ill and that I was about totake her to the hospital in the city since I did not know what else to do tohelp her.As I spoke I realized that I was treading on dangerous ground. I had no way ofassessing how much information I should divulge to them about the true nature ofmy bout with dona Soledad. I began to look for clues. I thought that if Iwatched carefully, their voices or the expression on their faces would betrayhow much they knew.But they remained silent and let me do all the talking. I began to doubt that Ishould volunteer any information at all. In my effort to figure out what to doand not blunder, I ended up talking nonsense. Lidia cut me off. In a dry toneshe said that I should not concern myself with dona Soledad's health becausethey had already taken steps to help her. That statement forced me to ask her ifshe knew what dona Soledad's trouble was.\"You've taken her soul,\" she said accusingly.My first reaction was to defend myself. I began to talk vehemently but ended upcontradicting myself. They stared at me. I was making no sense at all. I triedagain to say the same thing in a different way. My fatigue was so intense that Icould hardly organize my thoughts. Finally I gave up.\"Where are Pablito and Nestor?\" I asked after a long pause.\"They'll be here shortly,\" Lidia said briskly.\"Were you with them?\" I asked.\"No! \" she exclaimed, and stared at me.\"We never go together,\" Rosa explained. \"Those bums are different from us.\"Lidia made an imperative gesture with her foot to shut her up. She seemed to bethe one who gave the orders. Catching the movement of her feet brought to myawareness a most peculiar facet of my relationship with don Juan.In the countless times that we had roamed together, he had succeeded in teachingme, without really trying, a system of covert communication through some codedmovements of the feet. I watched Lidia give Rosa the sign for horrible, a signgiven when anything that happens to be in sight of the signers is unpleasant ordangerous. In this case me. I laughed. I remembered that don Juan had given methat sign when I first met don Genaro.I pretended not to be aware of what was going on in order to find out if I coulddecode all their signs.Rosa made the sign that she wanted to step on me. Lidia answered with animperative sign for no.According to don Juan, Lidia was very talented. As far as he was concerned shewas more sensitive and alert than Pablito and Nestor and myself. I had alwaysbeen incapable of making friends with her. She was aloof, and very cutting. Shehad enormous, black, shifty eyes that never looked straight at anyone, highcheekbones and a chiseled nose, which was a bit flat and broad at the bridge. Iremembered her having red, sore eyelids and everyone taunting her on account ofthat. The redness of her eyelids had disappeared but she continued to rub hereyes and blink a great deal. During my years of association with don Juan anddon GenaroI had seen Lidia the most, and yet we had probably never exchanged more than adozen words with each other. Pablito regarded her as a most dangerous being. Ialways thought she was just extremely shy.Rosa, on the other hand, was very boisterous. I thought she was the youngest.Her eyes were very frank and shiny. She was never shifty, but very bad-tempered.I had talked with Rosa more than anyone else. She was friendly, very bold andvery funny.\"Where are the others?\" I asked Rosa. \"Aren't they going to come out?\"\"They will be out shortly,\" Lidia answered.I could tell from their expressions that friendliness was not what they had inmind. Judging from their foot messages they were as dangerous as dona Soledad,and yet as I sat there looking at them it occurred to me that they weregorgeously beautiful. I had the warmest feelings for them.In fact, the more they stared into my eyes the more intense that feeling became.At one moment it was sheer passion that I felt for them. They were so alluringthat I could have sat there for hours just looking at them, but a soberingthought made me stand up. I was not going to repeat my bungling of the nightbefore. I decided that the best defense was to put my cards on the table.In a firm tone I told them that don Juan had set up some sort of trial for meusing dona Soledad, or vice versa. Chances were that he had also set them up inthe same fashion, and we were going to be pitted against one another in somesort of battle that could result in injury to some of us. I appealed to theirsense of warriorship. If they were the truthful heirs of don Juan, they had tobe impeccable with me, reveal their designs and not behave like ordinary, greedyhuman beings.I turned to Rosa and asked her the reason for wishing to step on me. She wastaken aback for an instant and then she became angry. Her eyes flared with rage.Her small mouth contracted.Lidia, in a very coherent manner, said that I had nothing to fear from them, andthat Rosa was angry with me because I had hurt dona Soledad. Her feelings werepurely a personal reaction.I said then that it was time I left. I stood up. Lidia made a gesture to stopme. She seemed scared or deeply concerned. She began to protest, when a noisecoming from outside the door distracted me. The two girls jumped to my side.Something heavy was leaning or pushing against the door. I noticed then that thegirls had secured it with the heavy iron bar. I had a feeling of disgust. Thewhole affair was going to be repeated again and I was sick and tired of it all.The girls glanced at each other, then looked at me and then looked at each otheragain.I heard the whining and heavy breathing of a large animal outside the house. Itmight have been the dog. Exhaustion blinded me at that point. I rushed to thedoor, removed the heavy iron bar, and started to open it. Lidia threw herselfagainst the door and shut it again.\"The Nagual was right,\" she said, out of breath. \"You think and think. You'redumber than I thought.\"She pulled me back to the table. I rehearsed in my mind the best way to tellthem, once and for all, that I had had enough. Rosa sat next to me touching me.I could feel her leg nervously rubbing against mine. Lidia was standing facingme looking at me fixedly. Her burning black eyes seemed to be saying something Icould not understand.I began to speak but I did not finish. I had a sudden and most profoundawareness. My body was aware of a greenish light; a fluorescence outside thehouse. I did not see or hear anything. I was simply aware of the light as if Iwere suddenly falling asleep and my thoughts were turning into images that weresuperimposed on the world of everyday life.The light was moving at a great speed. I could sense it with my stomach. Ifollowed it, or rather I focused my attention on it for an instant as it movedaround. A great clarity of mind ensued from focusing my attention on the light.I knew then that in that house in the presence of those people it was wrong anddangerous to behave as an innocent bystander.\"Aren't you afraid?\" Rosa asked, pointing to the door.Her voice disrupted my concentration.I admitted that whatever was there was scaring me at a very deep level; enoughto make me die of fright. I wanted to say more, but right then I had a surge ofwrath and I wanted to see and talk with dona Soledad. I did not trust her. Iwent directly to her room. She was not there. I began to call her, bellowing hername. The house had one more room. I pushed the door open and rushed inside.There was no one in there. My anger increased in the same proportion as my fear.I went out the back door and walked around to the front. Not even the dog was insight. I banged on the front door furiously. Lidia opened it. I entered. Iyelled at her to tell me where everybody was. She lowered her eyes and did notanswer. She wanted to close the door but I would not let her. She quickly walkedaway and went into the other room.I sat down again at the table. Rosa had not moved. She seemed to be frozen onthe spot.\"We are the same,\" she said suddenly. \"The Nagual told us that.\"\"Tell me, then, what was prowling around the house?\" I asked.\"The ally,\" she said.\"Where is it now?\"\"It is still here. It won't go. The moment you're weak it'll squash you. Butwe're not the ones who can tell you anything.\"\"Who can tell me, then?\"\"La Gorda!\" Rosa exclaimed, opening her eyes as wide as she could. \"She's theone. She knows everything.\"Rosa asked me if she could close the door, just to be on the safe side. Withoutwaiting for an answer, she inched her way to the door and slammed it shut.\"There is nothing we can do except wait until everyone is here,\" she said.Lidia came back into the room with a package, an object wrapped up in a piece ofdark yellow cloth. She seemed very relaxed. I noticed that she had a mostcommandeering touch. Somehow she imparted her mood to Rosa and myself.\"Do you know what I have here?\" she asked me.I did not have the vaguest idea. She began to unwrap it in a very deliberatemanner, taking her time. Then she stopped and looked at me. She seemed tovacillate. She grinned as if she were too shy to show what was in the bundle.\"This package was left by the Nagual for you,\" she muttered, \"but I think we'dbetter wait for la Gorda.\"I insisted that she unwrap it. She gave me a ferocious look, and took thepackage out of the room without saying another word.I enjoyed Lidia's game. She had performed something quite in line with donJuan's teachings. She had given me a demonstration of how to get the best useout of an average situation. By bringing the package to me and pretending thatshe was going to open it after disclosing that don Juan had left it for me, shehad indeed created a mystery that was almost unbearable.She knew that I had to stay if I wanted to find out the contents of thatpackage. I could think of a number of things that might be in that bundle.Perhaps it was the pipe don Juan used when handling psychotropic mushrooms. Hehad intimated that the pipe would be given to me for safekeeping.Or it might have been his knife, or his leather pouch, or even his sorcery powerobjects. On the other hand, it might have been merely a ploy on Lidia's part.Don Juan was too sophisticated- too abstract to leave me an heirloom.I told Rosa that I was dead on my feet and weak from hunger. My idea was todrive to the city, rest for a couple of days, and then come back to see Pablitoand Nestor. I said that by then I might even get to meet the other two girls.Lidia returned then and Rosa told her of my intention to leave.\"The Nagual gave us orders to attend to you as if you were himself,\" Lidia said.\"We are all the Nagual himself, but you are even more so for some reason that noone understands.\"Both of them talked to me at once and guaranteed in various ways that no one wasgoing to attempt anything against me as dona Soledad had. Both of them had sucha fierce look of honesty in their eyes that my body was overwhelmed. I trustedthem.\"You must stay until la Gorda comes back,\" Lidia said.\"The Nagual said that you should sleep in his bed,\" Rosa added.I began to pace the floor in the throes of a weird dilemma. On the one hand, Iwanted to stay and rest. I felt physically at ease and happy in their presence;something I had not felt the day before with dona Soledad.My reasonable side, on the other hand, had not relaxed at all. At that level, Iwas as frightened as I had been all along. I had had moments of blind despairand had taken bold actions, but after the momentum of those actions had ceased,I had felt as vulnerable as ever.I engaged in some soul-searching analysis as I paced the room almostfrantically. The two girls remained quiet looking at me anxiously.Then all of a sudden the riddle was solved. I knew that something in me was justpretending to be afraid. I had become accustomed to reacting that way in donJuan's presence. Throughout the years of our association I had relied heavily onhim to furnish me with convenient pacifiers for my fright. My dependency on himhad given me solace and security.But it was no longer tenable. Don Juan was gone. His apprentices did not havehis patience, or his sophistication, or his sheer command. With them my need toseek solace was plain stupidity.The girls led me to the other room. The window faced the southeast, and so didthe bed which was a thick mat like a mattress. A two foot long bulky piece ofmaguey stalk had been carved so that the porous tissue served as a pillow or aneckrest. In the middle part of it there was a gentle dip. The surface of themaguey was very smooth. It appeared to have been hand rubbed.I tried the bed and the pillow. The comfort and bodily satisfaction Iexperienced were unusual. Lying on don Juan's bed I felt secure and fulfilled.An unequaled peace swept through my body. I had had a similar feeling oncebefore when don Juan had made a bed for me on top of a hill in the desert innorthern Mexico. I fell asleep.I woke up in the early evening. Lidia and Rosa were nearly on top of me soundasleep. I stayed motionless for one or two seconds. Then both of them woke up atonce.Lidia yawned and said that they had had to sleep next to me in order to protectme and make me rest. I was famished. Lidia sent Rosa to the kitchen to make ussome food. In the meantime, she lit all the lanterns in the house. When the foodwas ready we sat down at the table. I felt as if I had known them or been withthem all my life. We ate in silence.When Rosa was clearing the table I asked Lidia if all of them slept in theNagual's bed. It was the only other bed in the house besides dona Soledad's.Lidia said, in a matter-of-fact tone, that they had moved out of that houseyears before to a place of their own in the same vicinity, and that Pablito hadalso moved when they did and lived with Nestor and Benigno.\"But what's happened to you people? I thought that you were all together,\" Isaid.\"Not anymore,\" Lidia replied. \"Since the Nagual left, we have had separatetasks. The Nagual joined us and the Nagual took us apart.\"\"And where's the Nagual now?\" I asked in the most casual tone I could affect.Both of them looked at me and then glanced at each other.\"Oh, we don't know,\" Lidia said. \"He and Genaro left.\"She seemed to be telling the truth, but I insisted once more that they tell mewhat they knew.\"We really don't know anything,\" Lidia snapped at me, obviously flustered by myquestions. \"They moved to another area. You have to ask that question of laGorda. She has something to tell you. She knew yesterday that you had come andwe rushed all night to get here. We were afraid that you were dead. The Nagualtold us that you are the only one we should help and trust. He said that you arehimself.\"She covered her face and giggled, and then added as an afterthought, \"But that'shard to believe.\"\"We don't know you,\" Rosa said. \"That's the trouble. The four of us feel thesame way. We were afraid that you were dead, and then when we saw you we got madat you for not being dead. Soledad is like our mother; maybe more than that.\"They exchanged conspiratorial looks with each other. I immediately interpretedthat as a sign of trouble. They were up to no good. Lidia noticed my suddendistrust which must have been written all over my face. She reacted with aseries of assertions about their desire to help me.I really had no reason to doubt their sincerity. If they had wanted to hurt methey could have done so while I was asleep. She sounded so earnest that I feltpetty. I decided to distribute the gifts I had brought for them. I told themthat there were unimportant trinkets in the packages and that they could chooseany one they liked.Lidia said that they would prefer it if I assigned the gifts myself. In a verypolite tone she added that they would be grateful if I would also cure Soledad.\"What do you think I should do to cure her?\" I asked her after a long silence.\"Use your double,\" she said in a matter-of-fact tone.I carefully went over the fact that dona Soledad had nearly assassinated me, andthat I had survived by the grace of something in me which was neither my skillnor my knowledge. As far as I was concerned, that undefined something thatseemed to have delivered a blow to her was real, but unreachable. In short, Icould not help dona Soledad any more than I could walk to the moon.They listened to me attentively and remained quiet but agitated.\"Where is dona Soledad now?\" I asked Lidia.\"She's with la Gorda,\" she said in a despondent tone. \"La Gorda took her awayand is trying to cure her, but we really don't know where they are. That's thetruth.\"\"And where's Josefina?\"\"She went to get the Witness. He is the only one who can cure Soledad. Rosathinks that you know more than the Witness, but since you're angry with Soledadyou want her dead. We don't blame you.\"I assured them that I was not angry with her, and above all I did not want herdead.\"Cure her, then!\" Rosa said in an angry, high-pitched voice. \"The Witness hastold us that you always know what to do, and the Witness can't be wrong.\"\"And who in the devil is the Witness?\"\"Nestor is the Witness,\" Lidia said as if she were reluctant to voice his name.\"You know that. You have to.\"I remembered that during our last meeting don Genaro had called Nestor theWitness. I thought at the time that the name was a joke or a ploy that donGenaro was using to ease the gripping tension and the anguish of those lastmoments together.\"That was no joke,\" Lidia said in a firm tone. \"Genaro and the Nagual followed adifferent path with the Witness. They took him along with them everywhere theywent. And I mean everywhere! The Witness has witnessed all there is to witness.\"Obviously there was a tremendous misunderstanding between us. I labored toexplain that I was practically a stranger to them. Don Juan had kept me awayfrom everyone, including Pablito and Nestor. Outside of the casual hellos andgoodbyes that all of them had exchanged with me over the years, we had neveractually talked.I knew all of them mainly through the descriptions that don Juan had given me.Although I had once met Josefina, I could not remember what she looked like, andall I had ever seen of la Gorda was her gigantic behind. I said to them that Ihad not even known until the day before that the four of them were don Juan'sapprentices, nor that Benigno was part of the group as well.They exchanged a coy look with each other. Rosa moved her lips to say somethingbut Lidia gave her a command with her feet. I felt that after my long andsoulful explanation they should not still sneak messages to each other. Mynerves were so taut that their covert foot movements were just the thing to sendme into a rage.I yelled at them at the top of my lungs and banged on the table with my righthand. Rosa stood up with unbelievable speed, and I suppose, as a response to hersudden movement my body by itself without the notice of my reason moved a stepback just in time to avoid by inches a blow from a massive stick or some heavyobject that Rosa was wielding in her left hand. It came down on the table with athunderous noise.I heard again, as I had heard the night before while dona Soledad was chokingme, a most peculiar and mysterious sound; a dry sound like a pipe breaking rightbehind my windpipe at the base of my neck. My ears popped, and with the speed oflightning my left arm came down on top of Rosa's stick and crushed it. I saw thewhole scene myself as if I had been watching a movie.Rosa screamed and I realized then that I had leaned forward with all my weight,and had struck the back of her hand with my left fist. I was appalled. Whateverwas happening to me was not real. It was a nightmare. Rosa kept on screaming.Lidia took her into don Juan's room. I heard her yells of pain for a few momentslonger and then they stopped. I sat down at the table. My thoughts weredisassociated and incoherent.The peculiar sound at the base of my neck was something I had become keenlyaware of. Don Juan had described it as the sound one makes at the moment ofchanging speed. I had the faint recollection of having experienced it in hiscompany. Although I had become aware of it the previous night, I had not fullyacknowledged it until it happened with Rosa.I realized then that the sound had created a special sensation of heat on theroof of my mouth and inside my ears. The force and dryness of the sound made methink of the peal of a large, cracked bell.Lidia returned awhile later. She seemed more calm and collected. She evensmiled. I asked her to please help me unravel that riddle and tell me what hadhappened. After a long vacillation she told me that when I had yelled and bangedon the table Rosa got excited and nervous; and believing I was going to hurtthem, she had tried to strike me with her \"dream hand.\" I had dodged her blowand hit her on the back of her hand the same way I had struck dona Soledad.Lidia said that Rosa's hand would be useless unless I found a way to help her.Rosa walked into the room then. Her arm was wrapped with a piece of cloth. Shelooked at me. Her eyes were like those of a child. My feelings were at theheight of turmoil. Some part of me felt ugly and guilty. But again another partremained unruffled. Had it not been for that part I would not have survivedeither dona Soledad's attack or Rosa's devastating blow.After a long silence I told them that it was very petty of me to be annoyed bytheir foot messages, but that there was no comparison between yelling or bangingon the table and what Rosa had done. In view of the fact that I had nofamiliarity with their practices, she could have severed my arm with her blow.I demanded, in a very intimidating tone, to see her hand. She reluctantlyunwrapped it. It was swollen and red. There was no doubt left in my mind thatthese people were carrying out some sort of test that don Juan had set up forme. By confronting them I was being hurled into a realm which was impossible toreach or accept in rational terms.He had said time and time again that my rationality comprised only a very smallpart of what he had called the 'totality of oneself'. Under the impact of theunfamiliar and the altogether real danger of my physical annihilation, my bodyhad had to make use of its hidden resources, or die. The trick seemed to be inthe truthful acceptance of the possibility that such resources exist and can bereached. The years of training had been but the steps to arrive to thatacceptance.Truthful to his premise of no compromise, don Juan had aimed at a total victoryor a total defeat for me. If the training had failed to put me in contact withmy hidden resources, the test would have made it evident; in which case therewould have been very little I could have done. Don Juan had said to dona Soledadthat I would have killed myself. Being such a profound connoisseur of humannature, he was probably right.It was time to adopt a new course of action. Lidia had said that I could helpRosa and dona Soledad with the same force that had caused them injury. Theproblem, therefore, was to get the right sequence of feelings, or thoughts, orwhatever, that led my body to unleash that force. I took Rosa's hand and rubbedit. I willed it to be cured. I had only the best feelings for her. I caressedher hand and hugged her for a long time. I rubbed her head and she fell asleepon my shoulder, but there was no change in the redness or the swelling.Lidia watched me without saying a word. She smiled at me. I wanted to tell herthat I was a fiasco as a healer. Her eyes seemed to catch my mood, and they heldit until it froze.Rosa wanted to sleep. She was either dead tired or ill. I did not want to findout which. I picked her up in my arms. She was lighter than I would haveimagined. I took her to don Juan's bed and gently placed her on it. Lidiacovered her. The room was very dark. I looked out of the window and saw acloudless sky filled with stars. Up to that moment I had been oblivious to thefact that we were at a very high altitude.As I looked at the sky, I felt a surge of optimism. Somehow the stars lookedfestive to me. The southeast was indeed a lovely direction to face.I had a sudden urge that I felt obliged to satisfy. I wanted to see howdifferent the view of the sky was from dona Soledad's window which faced thenorth. I took Lidia by the hand with the intention of leading her there, but aticklish sensation on top of my head stopped me. It went like a ripple down myback to my waist, and from there it went to the pit of my stomach. I sat down onthe mat. I made an effort to think about my feelings. It seemed that at the verymoment that I had felt the tickling on my head, my thoughts had diminished instrength and number. I tried, but I could not involve myself in the usual mentalprocess that I call thinking.My mental deliberations made me oblivious to Lidia. She had knelt on the floorfacing me. I became aware that her enormous eyes were scrutinizing me from a fewinches away. I automatically took her hand again and walked to dona Soledad'sroom.As we reached the door I felt her whole body stiffening. I had to pull her. Iwas about to cross the threshold when I caught sight of the bulky, dark mass ofa human body huddled against the wall opposite the door. The sight was sounexpected that I gasped and let go of Lidia's hand.It was dona Soledad. She was resting her head against the wall. I turned toLidia. She had recoiled a couple of steps. I wanted to whisper that dona Soledadhad returned, but there were no sounds to my words although I was sure I hadvocalized them. I would have tried to talk again had it not been that I had anurge to act. It was as if words took too much time and I had very little of it.I stepped into the room and walked over to dona Soledad. She appeared to be ingreat pain. I squatted by her side, and rather than asking her anything, Ilifted her face to look at her. I saw something on her forehead. It looked likethe plaster of leaves that she had made for herself. It was dark; viscous to thetouch. I felt the imperative need to peel it off her forehead. In a very boldfashion I grabbed her head, tilled it back, and yanked the plaster off. It waslike peeling off rubber.She did not move or complain about pain. Underneath the plaster there was ayellowish-green blotch. It moved, as if it were alive or imbued with energy. Ilooked at it for a moment; unable to do anything. I poked it with my finger andit stuck to it like glue. I did not panic as I ordinarily would have. I ratherliked the stuff. I stirred it with the tips of my fingers and all of it came offher forehead. I stood up. The gooey substance felt warm. It was like a stickypaste for an instant and then it dried up between my fingers and on the palm ofmy hand.I then felt another jolt of apprehension and ran to don Juan's room. I grabbedRosa's arm and wiped the same fluorescent yellowish-green stuff from her handthat I had wiped from dona Soledad's forehead.My heart was pounding so hard that I could hardly stand on my feet. I wanted tolie down, but something in me pushed me to the window and made me jog on thespot.I cannot recall how long I jogged there. Suddenly I felt that someone was wipingmy neck and shoulders. I became aware then that I was practically nude,perspiring profusely. Lidia had a cloth around my shoulders and was wiping thesweat off my face.My normal thought processes came back to me all at once. I looked around theroom. Rosa was sound asleep. I ran to dona Soledad's room. I expected to findher also asleep, but there was no one there. Lidia had trailed behind me. I toldher what had happened. She rushed to Rosa and woke her up while I put on myclothes. Rosa did not want to wake up. Lidia grabbed her injured hand andsqueezed it. In one single springing movement, Rosa stood up and was fullyawake.They began to rush around the house turning off the lanterns. They seemed to begetting ready to run away. I wanted to ask them why they were in such a hurrywhen I realized that I had dressed in a great hurry myself. We were rushingtogether; and not only that: They seemed to be waiting for direct commands fromme.We ran out of the house carrying all the packages I had brought. Lidia hadadvised me not to leave any of them behind. I had not yet assigned them and theystill belonged to me. I threw them in the back seat of the car while the twogirls crammed into the front. I started the car and backed up slowly; finding myway in the darkness.Once we were on the road, I was brought face to face with the most pressingissue. Both of them said in unison that I was the leader. Their actions weredependent on my decisions. I was the Nagual. We could not just run out of thehouse and drive away aimlessly. I had to guide them.But the truth was that I had no idea where to go or what to do. I turnedcasually to look at them. The headlights cast a glare inside the car and theireyes were like mirrors that reflected it. I remembered that don Juan's eyes didthe same. They seemed to reflect more light than the eyes of an average person.I knew that the two girls were aware of my impasse. Rather than making a jokeabout it in order to cover up my incapacity, I bluntly put the responsibility ofa solution in their laps. I said that I lacked practice as the Nagual, and wouldappreciate it if they would oblige me with a suggestion or a hint as to where weshould go. They seemed disgusted with me. They clicked their tongues and shooktheir heads. I mentally shuffled through various courses of action, none ofwhich was feasible, such as driving them to town, or taking them to Nestor'shouse, or even taking them to Mexico City.I stopped the car. I was driving toward town. I wanted more than anything elsein the world to have a heart-to-heart talk with the girls. I opened my mouth tobegin, but they turned away from me, faced each other and put their arms aroundeach other's shoulders. That appeared to be an indication that they had lockedthemselves in and were not listening to me.My frustration was enormous. What I craved for at that moment was don Juan'smastery over any situation at hand; his intellectual companionship; his humor.Instead I was in the company of two nincompoops.I caught a gesture of dejection in Lidia's face and that stopped my avalanche ofself-pity. I became overtly aware, for the first time, that there was no end toour mutual disappointment. Obviously they too were accustomed, although in adifferent manner, to the mastery of don Juan. For them the shift from the Nagualhimself to me must have been disastrous.I sat for a long while with the motor running. Then all at once I again had abodily shiver that started on the top of my head as a ticklish sensation and Iknew then what had happened when I had entered dona Soledad's room awhilebefore. I had not seen her in an ordinary sense.What I had thought was dona Soledad huddled against the wall was in fact thememory of her leaving her body the instant after I had hit her. I also knew thatwhen I touched that gooey phosphorescent substance, I had cured her, and that itwas some sort of energy I had left in her head and in Rosa's hand with my blows.A vision of a particular ravine went through my mind. I became convinced thatdona Soledad and la Gorda were there. My knowledge was not a mere conjecture. Itwas rather a truth that needed no further corroboration. La Gorda had taken donaSoledad to the bottom of that particular ravine and was at that precise momentattempting to cure her. I wanted to tell her that it was wrong to treat theswelling in dona Soledad's forehead, and that there was no longer a need forthem to stay there.I described my vision to the girls. Both of them told me, the way don Juan usedto tell me, not to indulge. With him, however, that reaction was more congruous.I had never really minded his criticisms or scorn, but the two girls were in adifferent league. I felt insulted.\"I'll take you home,\" I said. \"Where do you live?\"Lidia turned to me and in a most furious tone said that both of them were mywards and that I had to deliver them to safety, since at the request of theNagual they had relinquished their freedom to act in order to help me.I had a fit of anger at that point. I wanted to slap the two girls, but then Ifelt the curious shiver running through my body once more. It started again as atickling on top of my head which went down my back until it reached my umbilicalregion, and then I knew where they lived. The ticklishness was like a shield, asoft, warm sheet of film. I could sense it physically, covering the area betweenmy pubis and the edge of my rib cage.My wrath disappeared and was replaced by a strange sobriety, an aloofness, andat the same time a desire to laugh. I knew then of something transcendental.Under the impact of dona Soledad and the little sisters' actions, my body hadsuspended judgment. I had, in don Juan's terms, stopped the world. I hadamalgamated two disassociated sensations. The ticklishness on the very top of myhead and the dry cracking sound at the base of my neck. Between them lay themeans to that suspension of judgment.As I sat in my car with those two girls on the side of a deserted mountain road,I knew for a fact that for the first time I had had a complete awareness ofstopping the world. That feeling brought to my mind the memory of another,similar, first-time bodily awareness I had had years before. It had to do withthe ticklishness on top of the head. Don Juan said that sorcerers had tocultivate such a sensation and he described it at great length.According to him, it was a sort of itching, which was neither pleasurable norpainful, and which occurred on the very top of one's head. In order to make meaware of it on an intellectual level, he described and analyzed its features;and then on the practical side, he attempted to guide me in developing thenecessary bodily awareness and memory of this feeling by making me run underbranches or rocks that protruded on a horizontal plane a few inches above myheight.For years I tried to follow what he was pointing out to me. However, on the onehand, I was incapable of understanding what he meant by his description; and onthe other hand, I was incapable of providing my body with the adequate memory byfollowing his pragmatic steps. Never did I feel anything on top of my head as Iran underneath the branches or rocks he had selected for his demonstrations.But one day my body by itself discovered the sensation while I was driving ahigh panel-truck into a three-story parking structure. I entered the gate of thestructure at the same speed I usually did in my small, two-door sedan. Theresult was that from the high seat of the truck I perceived the transversecement beam of the roof coming at my head. I could not stop the truck in timeand the feeling I got was that the cement beam was scalping me. I had neverdriven a motor vehicle which was as high as that truck, thus I was incapable ofmaking the necessary perceptual adjustments. The space between the roof of thetruck and the roof of the parking structure seemed nonexistent for me. I feltthe beam with my scalp.That day I drove for hours inside the structure, giving my body a chance tostore the memory of that ticklish sensation.I faced the two girls and wanted to tell them that I had just found out wherethey lived. I desisted. There was no way of describing to them that the ticklishsensation had made me remember a casual remark that don Juan had once made as wepassed a house on our way to Pablito's place. He had pointed out an unusualfeature in the surroundings and said that that house was an ideal place forquietness but was not a place to rest. I drove them there.Their house was rather big. It was also an adobe structure with a tile roof likedona Soledad's. It had one long room in the front, a roofed open-air kitchen inback of the house, a huge patio next to the kitchen, and an area for chickensbeyond the patio. The most important part of their house, however, was a closedroom with two doors, one opening to the front room and the other to the back.Lidia said that they had built it themselves. I wanted to see it, but both ofthem said that it was not the appropriate time because Josefina and la Gordawere not present to show me the parts of the room that belonged to them.In the corner of the front room there was a sizable, built-in brick platform. Itwas about eighteen inches high and had been constructed like a bed with one endagainst the wall. Lidia put some thick straw mats on its flat top and urged meto lie down and sleep while they watched over me.Rosa had lit a lantern and hung it on a nail above the bed. There was enoughlight to write. I explained to them that writing eased my tension and asked ifit bothered them.\"Why do you have to ask?\" Lidia retorted. \"Just do it!\"In the vein of a perfunctory explanation I told them that I had always done somethings, such as taking notes, which were strange even to don Juan and don Genaroand would perforce be strange to them.\"We all do strange things,\" Lidia said dryly.I sat down on the bed under the lantern with my back against the wall. They laydown next to me, one on each side. Rosa covered herself with a blanket and wentto sleep as if all she needed to do was to lie down. Lidia said that then wasthe appropriate time and place for us to talk, although she would prefer that Iturn off the light because it made her sleepy.Our conversation in the darkness centered around the whereabouts of the othertwo girls. She said that she could not even imagine where la Gorda was, but thatJosefina was undoubtedly in the mountains, still looking for Nestor, even thoughit was dark. She explained that Josefina was the most capable one to take careof herself in eventualities such as being in a deserted place in the dark. Thatwas the reason why la Gorda had selected her to run that errand.I mentioned that in listening to them talk about la Gorda I had formed theopinion that she was the boss. Lidia replied that la Gorda was indeed in charge,and that the Nagual himself had put her in command. She added that even if hehad not done so, la Gorda would have taken over, sooner or later, because shewas the best.I was compelled at that point to light the lantern in order to write. Lidiacomplained that the light made it impossible to stay awake, but I prevailed.\"What makes la Gorda the best?\" I asked.\"She has more personal power,\" she said. \"She knows everything. Besides, theNagual taught her how to control people.\"\"Do you envy la Gorda for being the best?\"\"I used to, but not now.\"\"Why did you change?\"\"I finally accepted my fate, as the Nagual told me.\"\"And what is your fate?\"\"My fate... my fate is to be the breeze. To be a dreamer. My fate is to be awarrior.\"\"Do Rosa or Josefina envy la Gorda?\"\"No, they don't. All of us have accepted our fates. The Nagual said that powercomes only after we accept our fate without recriminations. I used to complain alot and feel terrible because I liked the Nagual. I thought I was a woman. Buthe showed me that I was not. He showed me that I was a warrior. My life hadended before I met him. This body that you see here is new. The same thinghappened to all of us. Perhaps you were not like us, but to us the Nagual was anew life.\"When he told us that he was going to leave, because he had to do other things,we thought we would die. But look at us now. We're alive, and do you know why?Because the Nagual showed us that we were himself. He's here with us. He'llalways be here. We are his body and his spirit.\"\"Do all four of you feel the same way?\"\"We are not four. We are one. That is our fate. We have to carry each other. Andyou are the same. All of us are the same. Even Soledad is the same, although shegoes in a different direction.\"\"And Pablito, Nestor and Benigno? Where do they fit?\"\"We don't know. We don't like them. Especially Pablito. He's a coward. He hasnot accepted his fate and wants to wriggle out of it. He even wants to chuck hischances as a sorcerer and live an ordinary life. That'll be great for Soledad.But the Nagual gave us orders to help him. We are getting tired of helping him,though. Maybe one of these days la Gorda will push him out of the way forever.\"\"Can she do that?\"\"Can she do that! Of course she can. She's got more of the Nagual than the restof us. Perhaps even more than you.\"\"Why do you think the Nagual never told me that you were his apprentices?\"\"Because you're empty.\"\"Did he say that I was empty?\"\"Everyone knows you're empty. It is written on your body.\"\"How can you tell that?\"\"There is a hole in the middle.\"\"In the middle of my body? Where?\"She very gently touched a spot on the right side of my stomach. She drew acircle with her finger as if she were following the edges of an invisible holefour or five inches in diameter.\"Are you empty yourself, Lidia?\"\"Are you kidding? I am complete. Can't you see?\"Her answers to my questions were taking a turn that I had not expected. I didnot want to antagonize her with my ignorance. I shook my head affirmatively.\"Why do you think I have a hole here that makes me empty?\" I asked afterdeliberating what the most innocent question would be.She did not answer. She turned her back to me and complained that the light ofthe lantern bothered her eyes. I insisted on a response. She faced me defiantly.\"I don't want to talk to you anymore,\" she said. \"You are stupid. Not evenPablito is that stupid and he's the worst.\"I did not want to end up in another blind alley by pretending that I knew whatshe was talking about, so I asked her again what caused my emptiness. I coaxedher to talk, giving her ample assurances that don Juan had never explained thattopic to me.He had said time and time again that I was empty and I understood him the wayany Western man would understand that statement. I thought he meant that I wassomehow void of determination, will, purpose or even intelligence. He had neverspoken to me about a hole in my body.\"There is a hole there on the right side,\" she said matter-of-factly. \"A holethat a woman made when she emptied you.\"\"Would you know who the woman is?\"\"Only you can tell that. The Nagual said that men, most of the time, cannot tellwho had emptied them. Women are more fortunate. They know for a fact who emptiedthem.\"\"Are your sisters empty, like me?\"\"Don't be stupid. How can they be empty?\"\"Dona Soledad said that she was empty. Does she look like me?\"\"No. The hole in her stomach was enormous. It was on both sides, which meantthat a man and a woman emptied her.\"\"What did dona Soledad do with a man and a woman?\"\"She gave her completeness to them.\"I vacillated for a moment before asking the next question. I wanted to assessall the implications of her statement.\"La Gorda was even worse than Soledad,\" Lidia went on. \"Two women emptied her.The hole in her stomach was like a cavern. But now she has closed it. She iscomplete again.\"\"Tell me about those two women.\"\"I just can't tell you anything more,\" she said in a most imperative tone. \"Onlyla Gorda can speak to you about this matter. Wait until she comes.\"\"Why only la Gorda?\"\"Because she knows everything.\"\"Is she the only one who knows everything?\"\"The Witness knows as much, maybe even more, but he is Genaro himself and thatmakes him very difficult to handle. We don't like him.\"\"Why don't you like him?\"\"Those three bums are awful. They are crazy like Genaro. Well, they are Genarohimself. They are always fighting us because they were afraid of the Nagual andnow they are taking their revenge on us. That's what la Gorda says anyway.\"\"And what makes la Gorda say that?\"\"The Nagual told her things he didn't tell the rest of us. She sees. The Nagualsaid that you also see. Josefina, Rosa and I don't see, and yet all five of usare the same. We are the same.\"The phrase \"we are the same,\" which dona Soledad had used the night before,brought on an avalanche of thoughts and fears. I put my writing pad away. Ilooked around. I was in a strange world lying in a strange bed in between twoyoung women I did not know. And yet I felt at ease there. My body experiencedabandon and indifference. I trusted them.\"Are you going to sleep here?\" I asked.\"Where else?\"\"How about your own room?\"\"We can't leave you alone. We feel the same way you do. You are a stranger,except that we are bound to help you. La Gorda said that no matter how stupidyou are, we have to look after you. She said we have to sleep in the same bedwith you as if you were the Nagual himself.\"Lidia turned off the lantern. I remained sitting with my back against the wall.I closed my eyes to think and I fell asleep instantly.Lidia, Rosa and I had been sitting on a flat area just outside the front doorfor nearly two hours since eight o'clock in the morning. I had tried to steerthem into a conversation but they had refused to talk. They seemed to be veryrelaxed; almost asleep.Their mood of abandonment was not contagious, however. Sitting there in thatforced silence had put me into a mood of my own. Their house sat on top of asmall hill. The front door faced the east. From where I sat I could see almostthe entire narrow valley that ran from east to west. I could not see the town,but I could see the green areas of cultivated fields on the floor of the valley.On the other side and flanking the valley in every direction, there weregigantic, round, eroded hills. There were no high mountains in the vicinity ofthe valley; only those enormous, eroded, round hills, the sight of which createdin me the most intense feeling of oppression. I had the sensation that thosehills were about to transport me to another time.Lidia spoke to me all of a sudden and her voice disrupted my reverie. She pulledmy sleeve.\"Here comes Josefina,\" she said.I looked at the winding trail that led from the valley to the house. I saw awoman walking slowly up the trail, perhaps fifty yards away. I noticedimmediately the remarkable difference in age between Lidia and Rosa and theapproaching woman.I looked at her again. I would never have thought Josefina to be that old.Judging by her slow gait and the posture of her body, she seemed to be a womanin her midfifties. She was thin, wore a long dark skirt and was carrying a loadof firewood on her back.She had a bundle tied around her waist. It looked as though she had a bundled-upchild riding on her left hip. She seemed to be breast-feeding it as she walked.Her steps were almost feeble. She could barely make the last steep slope beforereaching the house.When she finally stood in front of us, a few yards away, she was panting soheavily that I attempted to help her sit down. She made a gesture that seemed tosay that she was all right.I heard Lidia and Rosa giggling. I did not look at them because my totalattention had been taken by assault. The woman in front of me was absolutely themost disgusting, foul creature I had ever seen. She untied the bundle offirewood and dropped it on the floor with a loud clatter. I jumpedinvoluntarily, due in part to the loud noise, and in part to the fact that thewoman nearly fell on my lap pulled by the weight of the wood.She looked at me for an instant and then lowered her eyes; seemingly embarrassedby her clumsiness. She straightened her back and sighed with apparent relief.Obviously the load had been too great for her old body.As she stretched her arms, her hair fell partially loose. She was wearing asoiled headband tied over her forehead. Her hair was long and graying, andseemed dirty and matted. I could see the white hairs against the dark brown ofthe headband. She smiled at me and sort of nodded her head. All her teeth seemedto be missing. I could see the black hole of her toothless mouth. She coveredher face with her hand and laughed. She took off her sandals and walked into thehouse without giving me time to say anything. Rosa followed her.I was dumbfounded. Dona Soledad had implied that Josefina was the same age asLidia and Rosa. I turned to Lidia. She was peering at me.\"I had no idea she was that old,\" I said.\"Yes, she's pretty old,\" she said in a matter-of-fact tone.\"Does she have a child?\" I asked.\"Yes, and she takes him everywhere. She never leaves him with us. She's afraidwe are going to eat him.\"\"Is it a boy?\"\"A boy.\"\"How old is he?\"\"She's had him for some time. But I don't know his age. We thought that sheshouldn't have a child at her age. But she didn't pay any attention to us.\"\"Whose child is he?\"\"Josefina's, of course.\"\"I mean, who's the father?\"\"The Nagual, who else?\"I thought that that development was quite extravagant and very unnerving.\"I suppose anything is possible in the Nagual's world,\" I said.I meant it more as a thought to myself than a statement made to Lidia.\"You bet,\" she said, and laughed.The oppressiveness of those eroded hills became unbearable. There was somethingtruly abhorrent about that area, and Josefina had been the final blow. On top ofhaving an ugly, old, smelly body and no teeth, she also seemed to have some sortof facial paralysis. The muscles on the left side of her face appeared to beinjured, a condition which created a most unpleasant distortion of her left eyeand the left side of her mouth.My oppressive mood plummeted to one of sheer anguish. For an instant I toyedwith the idea, so familiar by then, of running to my car and driving away.I complained to Lidia that I did not feel well. She laughed and said thatJosefina had no doubt scared me.\"She has that effect on people,\" she said. \"Everybody hates her guts. She'suglier than a cockroach.\"\"I remember seeing her once,\" I said, \"but she was young.\"\"Things change,\" Lidia said philosophically, \"one way or another. Look atSoledad. What a change, eh? And you yourself have changed. You look more massivethan I remember you. You are looking more and more like the Nagual.\"I wanted to say that the change in Josefina was abhorrent but I was afraid thatshe might overhear me.I looked at the eroded hills across the valley. I felt like fleeing from them.\"The Nagual gave us this house,\" she said, \"but it is not a house for rest. Wehad another house before that was truly beautiful. This is a place to steam up.Those mountains over there will drive you nuts.\"Her boldness in reading my feelings gave me a respite. I did not know what tosay.\"We are all naturally lazy,\" she went on. \"We don't like to strain ourselves.The Nagual knew that, so he must have figured that this place would drive us upthe walls.\"She stood up abruptly and said that she wanted something to eat. We went to thekitchen; a semienclosed area with only two walls. At the open end, to the rightof the door, there was an earthen stove. At the other end, where the two wallsmet, there was a large dining area with a long table and three benches. Thefloor was paved with smooth river rocks. The flat roof was about ten feet highand was resting on the two walls and on thick supporting beams on the opensides.Lidia poured me a bowl of beans and meat from a pot which cooked on a very lowfire. She heated up some tortillas over the fire. Rosa came in and sat down nextto me and asked Lidia to serve her some food.I became immersed in watching Lidia use a ladle to scoop the beans and meat. Sheseemed to have an eye for the exact amount. She must have been aware that I wasadmiring her maneuvers. She took two or three beans from Rosa's bowl andreturned them to the pot.Out of the corner of my eye I saw Josefina coming into the kitchen. I did notlook at her, though. She sat facing me across the table. I had a squeamishfeeling in my stomach. I felt that I could not eat with that woman looking atme.To ease my tension I joked with Lidia that there were still two extra beans inRosa's bowl that she had overlooked. She scooped up two beans with the ladlewith a precision that made me gasp. I laughed nervously, knowing that once Lidiasat down I would have to move my eyes from the stove and acknowledge thepresence of Josefina.I finally and reluctantly had to look across the table at Josefina. There was adead silence. I stared at her incredulously. My mouth fell open. I heard theloud laughter of Lidia and Rosa. It took an endless moment for me to put mythoughts and feelings in some sort of order.Whoever was facing me was not the Josefina I had seen just awhile ago, but avery pretty girl. She did not have Indian features as Lidia and Rosa did. Sheseemed to be more Latin than Indian. She had a light olive complexion, a verysmall mouth, a finely chiseled nose, small white teeth and short, black, curlyhair. She had a dimple on the left side of her face, which gave a definitecockiness to her smile.She was the girl I had met briefly years ago. She held my scrutiny. Her eyeswere friendly. I became possessed by degrees with some uncontrollablenervousness. I ended up desperately clowning about my genuine bewilderment.They laughed like children. After their laughter had subsided I wanted to knowwhat was the point of Josefina's histrionic [* histrionic- characteristic ofacting or a stage performance] display.\"She's practicing the art of stalking,\" Lidia said. \"The Nagual taught us tobaffle people so they wouldn't notice us. Josefina is very pretty, and if shewalks alone at night no one will bother her if she is ugly and smelly; but ifshe goes out as she really is, well, you yourself can tell what would happen.\"Josefina nodded affirmatively and then contorted her face into the ugliestgrimace possible.\"She can hold that face all day,\" Lidia said.I contended that if I lived around that area I would certainly notice Josefinain her disguise more readily than if she did not have one.\"That disguise was just for you,\" Lidia said, and all three of them laughed.\"And look how it baffled you. You noticed her child even more than you noticedher.\"Lidia went into their room and brought out a package of rags that looked like abundled-up child and threw it on the table in front of me. I laugheduproariously with them.\"Do all of you have particular disguises?\" I asked.\"No. Only Josefina. No one around here knows her as she really is,\" Lidiareplied.Josefina nodded and smiled but she remained silent. I liked her tremendously.There was something so very innocent and sweet about her.\"Say something, Josefina,\" I said, grabbing her by her forearms.She looked at me bewildered, and recoiled. I thought that I had gotten carriedaway by my elation, and perhaps grabbed her too hard. I let her go. She sat upstraight. She contorted her small mouth and thin lips, and produced a mostgrotesque outburst of grunts and shrieks.Her whole face suddenly changed. A series of ugly, involuntary spasms marred hertranquil expression of a moment before.I looked at her, horrified. Lidia pulled me by the sleeve.\"Why do you have to scare her, stupid?\" she whispered. \"Don't you know that shebecame mute and can't talk at all?\"Josefina obviously understood her and seemed bent on protesting. She clenchedher fist at Lidia, and let out another outburst of extremely loud and horrifyingshrieks; and then choked and coughed. Rosa began to rub her back. Lidia tried todo the same but Josefina nearly hit her in the face.Lidia sat down next to me and made a gesture of impotence. She shrugged hershoulders.\"She's that way,\" Lidia whispered to me.Josefina turned to her. Her face was contorted in a most ugly grimace of anger.She opened her mouth and bellowed at the top of her voice some more frightening,guttural sounds.Lidia slid off the bench and in a most unobtrusive manner left the kitchen area.Rosa held Josefina by the arm. Josefina seemed to be the epitome of fury. Shemoved her mouth and contorted her face. In a matter of minutes she had lost allthe beauty and innocence that had enchanted me. I did not know what to do. Itried to apologize but Josefina's inhuman sounds drowned out my words. FinallyRosa took her into the house.Lidia returned and sat across the table from me.\"Something went wrong up here,\" she said, touching her head.\"When did it happen?\" I asked.\"A long time ago. The Nagual must have done something to her, because all of asudden she lost her speech.\"Lidia seemed sad. I had the impression that her sadness showed against herdesire. I even felt tempted to tell her not to struggle so hard to hide heremotions.\"How does Josefina communicate with you people?\" I asked. \"Does she write?\"\"Come on, don't be silly. She doesn't write. She's not you. She uses her handsand feet to tell us what she wants.\"Josefina and Rosa came back to the kitchen. They stood by my side. I thoughtthat Josefina was again the picture of innocence and candor. Her beatificexpression did not give the slightest inkling of the fact that she could becomeso ugly, so fast.Looking at her I had the sudden realization that her fabulous ability forgestures undoubtedly was intimately linked to her aphasia. [* aphasia- nabilityto use or understand language (spoken or written) because of a brain lesion] Ireasoned that only a person who had lost her capacity to verbalize could be soversed in mimicry.Rosa said to me that Josefina had confided that she wished she could talkbecause she liked me very much.\"Until you came she was happy the way she was,\" Lidia said in a harsh voice.Josefina shook her head affirmatively, corroborating Lidia's statement, and wentinto a mild outburst of sounds.\"I wish la Gorda was here,\" Rosa said. \"Lidia always gets Josefina angry.\"\"I don't mean to!\" Lidia protested.Josefina smiled at her and extended her arm to touch her. It seemed as if shewere attempting to apologize. Lidia brushed her hand away.\"Why, you mute imbecile,\" she muttered.Josefina did not get angry. She looked away. There was so much sadness in hereyes that I did not want to look at her. I felt compelled to intercede.\"She thinks she's the only woman in the world who has problems,\" Lidia snappedat me. \"The Nagual told us to drive her hard and without mercy until she nolonger feels sorry for herself.\"Rosa looked at me and reaffirmed Lidia's claim with a nod of her head.Lidia turned to Rosa and ordered her to leave Josefina's side. Rosa moved awaycomplyingly and sat on the bench next to me.\"The Nagual said that one of these days she will talk again,\" Lidia said to me.\"Hey!\" Rosa said, pulling my sleeve. \"Maybe you're the one who'll make hertalk.\"\"Yes!\" Lidia exclaimed as if she had had the same thought. \"Maybe that's why wehad to wait for you.\"\"It's so clear!\" Rosa added with the expression of having had a true revelation.Both of them jumped to their feet and embraced Josefina.\"You're going to talk again!\" Rosa exclaimed as she shook Josefina by theshoulders.Josefina opened her eyes and rolled them. She started making faint, muffledsighs, as if she were sobbing, and ended up running back and forth, crying likean animal. Her excitation was so great that she seemed to have locked her jawsopen. I honestly thought that she was on the brink of a nervous breakdown. Lidiaand Rosa ran to her side and helped her close her mouth. But they did not try tocalm her down.\"You're going to talk again! You're going to talk again!\" they shouted.Josefina sobbed and howled in a manner that sent chills down my spine.I was absolutely confounded. I tried to talk sense to them. I appealed to theirreason, but then I realized that they had very little of it by my standards. Ipaced back and forth in front of them trying to figure out what to do.\"You are going to help her, aren't you?\" Lidia demanded.\"Please, sir, please,\" Rosa pleaded with me.I told them that they were crazy, that I could not possibly know what to do. Andyet, as I talked I noticed that there was a funny feeling of optimism andcertainty in the back of my mind. I wanted to discard it at first, but it tookhold of me. Once before I had had a similar feeling in relation to a dear friend of mine whowas mortally ill. I thought I could make her well and actually leave thehospital where she lay dying. I even consulted don Juan about it.\"Sure. You can cure her and make her walk out of that death trap,\" he said.\"How?\" I asked him.\"It's a very simple procedure,\" he said. \"All you have to do is remind her thatshe's an incurable patient. Since she's a terminal case she has power. She hasnothing to lose anymore. She's lost everything already. When one has nothing tolose, one becomes courageous. We are timid only when there is something we canstill cling to.\"\"But is it enough just to remind her of that?\"\"No. That will give her the boost she needs. Then she has to push the diseaseaway with her left hand. She must push her arm out in front of her with her handclenched as if she were holding a knob. She must push on and on as she says out,out, out. Tell her that, since she has nothing else to do, she must dedicateevery second of her remaining life to performing that movement. I assure youthat she can get up and walk away, if she wants to.\"\"It sounds so simple,\" I said.Don Juan chuckled.\"It seems simple,\" he said, \"but it isn't. In order to do this your friend needsan impeccable spirit.\"He looked at me for a long time. He seemed to be measuring the concern andsadness I felt for my friend.\"Of course,\" he added, \"if your friend had an impeccable spirit she wouldn't bethere in the first place.\"I told my friend what don Juan had said. But she was already too weak even toattempt to move her arm. In Josefina's case my rationale for my secret confidence was the fact that shewas a warrior with an impeccable spirit. Would it be possible, I silently askedmyself, to apply the same hand movement to her?I told Josefina that her incapacity to speak was due to some sort of blockage.\"Yes, yes, it's a blockage,\" Lidia and Rosa repeated after me.I explained to Josefina the arm movement and told her that she had to push thatblockage by moving her arm in that fashion.Josefina's eyes were transfixed. She seemed to be in a trance. She moved hermouth, making barely audible sounds. She tried moving her arm, but herexcitation was so intense that she flung her arm without any coordination.I tried to redirect her movements, but she appeared to be so thoroughlybefuddled that she could not even hear what I was saying. Her eyes went out offocus and I knew she was going to faint.Rosa apparently realized what was happening. She jumped away and grabbed a cupof water and sprinkled it over Josefina's face. Josefina's eyes rolled back,showing the whites of her eyes. She blinked repeatedly until she could focus hereyes again. She moved her mouth, but she made no sound.\"Touch her throat!\" Rosa yelled at me.\"No! No!\" Lidia shouted back. \"Touch her head. It's in her head, you dummy! \"She grabbed my hand and I reluctantly let her place it on Josefina's head.Josefina shivered, and little by little she let out a series of faint sounds.Somehow they seemed to me more melodious than the inhuman sounds she madebefore.Rosa also must have noticed the difference.\"Did you hear that? Did you hear that?\" she asked me in a whisper.But whatever the difference might have been, Josefina let out another series ofsounds more grotesque than ever. When she quieted down, she sobbed for a momentand then entered into another state of euphoria. Lidia and Rosa finally quietedher. She plunked down on the bench, apparently exhausted. She could barely lifther eyelids to look at me. She smiled meekly.\"I am so very, very sorry,\" I said and held her hand.Her whole body vibrated. She lowered her head and began to weep again. I felt asurge of ultimate empathy for her. At that moment I would have given my life tohelp her.She sobbed uncontrollably as she tried to speak to me. Lidia and Rosa appearedto be so caught up in her drama that they were making the same gestures withtheir mouths.\"For heaven's sake, do something!\" Rosa exclaimed in a pleading voice.I experienced an unbearable anxiety. Josefina stood up and embraced me, orrather clung to me in a frenzy and pushed me away from the table. At thatinstant Lidia and Rosa, with astounding agility, speed and control, grabbed meby the shoulders with both hands and at the same time hooked the heels of myfeet with their feet.The weight of Josefina's body and her embrace, plus the speed of Lidia's andRosa's maneuver, rendered me helpless. They all moved at once, and before I knewwhat was happening, they had laid me on the floor with Josefina on top of me. Ifelt her heart pounding. She held on to me with great force. The sound of herheart reverberated in my ears. I felt it pounding in my own chest. I tried topush her away but she held on fast. Rosa and Lidia had me pinned down on thefloor with their weight on my arms and legs. Rosa cackled insanely and begannibbling on my side. Her small, sharp teeth chattered as her jaws snapped openand shut with nervous spasms.All at once I had a monstrous sensation of pain, physical revulsion and terror.I lost my breath. My eyes could not focus. I knew that I was passing out. Iheard then the dry, cracking sound of a pipe breaking at the base of my neck,and felt the ticklish sensation on top of my head running like a shiver throughmy entire body. The next thing I knew I was looking at them from the other sideof the kitchen. The three girls were staring at me while they lay on the floor.\"What are you people doing?\" I heard someone say in a loud, harsh, commandingvoice.I then had an inconceivable feeling. I felt Josefina let go of me and stand up.I was lying on the floor, and yet I was also standing a distance away from them,looking at a woman I had never seen before. She was by the door. She walkedtoward me, and stopped six or seven feet away. She stared at me for a moment. Iknew immediately that she was la Gorda. She demanded to know what was going on.\"We were just playing a little joke on him,\" Josefina said clearing her throat.\"I was pretending to be mute.\"The three girls huddled up close together and began to laugh. La Gorda remainedimpassive, looking at me.They had tricked me! I found my stupidity and gullibility so outrageous that Ihad a fit of hysterical laughter, which was almost out of control. My bodyshivered.I knew that Josefina had not just been playing, as she had claimed. The three ofthem had meant business. I had actually felt Josefina's body as a force that, infact, was getting inside my own body. Rosa's nibbling on my side, whichundoubtedly was a ruse to distract my attention, coincided with the sensation Ihad had that Josefina's heart was pounding inside my chest.I heard la Gorda urging me to calm down.I had a nervous flutter in my midsection and then a quiet, calm anger swept overme. I loathed them. I had had enough of them. I would have picked up my jacketand writing pad and walked out of the house had it not been that I was not quitemyself yet. I was somewhat dizzy and my senses were definitely out of line. Ihad had the sensation that when I had first looked at the girls from across thekitchen that I was actually viewing them from a position above my eye level;from a place close to the ceiling.But something even more disconcerting was that I had actually perceived that theticklish sensation on top of my head was what scooped me from Josefina'sembrace. It was not as if something came out from the top of my head. Somethingactually did come out from the top of my head.A few years before, don Juan and don Genaro had manoeuvred my perception and Ihad had an impossible double sensation. I felt that don Juan had fallen on topof me and pinned me to the ground, while at the same time I felt I was stillstanding up. I was actually in both places at once. In sorcerers' terms I couldsay that my body had stored the memory of that double perception and seemed tohave repeated it.There were, however, two new things that had been added to my bodily memory thistime. One was that the ticklish sensation I had become so aware of during thecourse of my confrontations with those women was the vehicle to arriving at thatdouble perception; and the other was that the sound at the base of my neck letloose something in me that was capable of coming out of the top of my head.After a minute or two I definitely felt that I was coming down from near theceiling until I was standing on the floor. It took a while for my eyes to adjustto seeing at my normal eye level.As I looked at the four women I felt naked and vulnerable. I then had an instantof disassociation, or lack of perceptual continuity. It was as if I had shut myeyes, and some force suddenly had made me twirl a couple of times. When I openedmy eyes the girls were staring at me with their mouths open. But somehow I wasmyself again. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"3. La Gorda The first thing I noticed about la Gorda was her eyes; very dark, and calm. Sheseemed to be examining me from head to toe. Her eyes scanned my body the sameway don Juan's used to. In fact, her eyes had the same calmness and force. Iknew why she was the best. The thought that came to my mind was that don Juanmust have left her his eyes.She was slightly taller than the other three girls. She had a lean, dark bodyand a superb back. I noticed the graceful line of her broad shoulders when shehalf turned her upper body to face the three girls.She gave them an unintelligible command and the three of them sat down on abench, right behind her. She was actually shielding them from me with her body.She turned to face me again. Her expression was one of utmost seriousness, butwithout a trace of gloom or heaviness. She did not smile and yet she wasfriendly. She had very pleasant features: a nicely shaped face, neither roundnor angular; a small mouth with thin lips; a broad nose; high cheekbones; andlong, jet-black hair.I could not help noticing her beautiful, muscular hands which she kept claspedin front of her over her umbilical region. The backs of her hands were turned tome. I could see her muscles being contracted rhythmically as she clasped herpalms.She was wearing a long, faded orange cotton dress with long sleeves and a brownshawl. There was something terribly calming and final about her. I felt thepresence of don Juan. My body relaxed.\"Sit down, sit down,\" she said to me in a coaxing tone.I walked back to the table. She pointed out a place for me to sit, but Iremained standing.She smiled for the first time and her eyes became softer and shinier. She wasnot as pretty as Josefina, and yet she was the most beautiful of all of them.We were quiet for a moment. In terms of an explanation she said that they haddone their best in the years since the Nagual left, and that because of theirdedication they had become accustomed to the task that he had left for them toperform.I did not quite understand what she was talking about, but as she spoke I feltmore than ever the presence of don Juan. It was not that she was copying hismanners, nor the inflection of his voice. She had an inner control that made heract the way don Juan did. Their similarity was from the inside out.I told her that I had come because I needed Pablito's and Nestor's help. I saidthat I was rather slow or even stupid in understanding the ways of sorcerers,but that I was sincere; and yet all of them had treated me with malice anddeceitfulness.She began to apologize but I did not let her finish. I picked up my things, andwent out the front door. She ran after me. She was not preventing me fromleaving but rather she was talking very fast as if she needed to say all shecould before I drove away.She said that I had to hear her out, and that she was willing to ride with meuntil she had told me everything the Nagual had entrusted her to tell me.\"I'm going to Mexico City,\" I said.\"I'll ride with you to Los Angeles if necessary,\" she said, and I knew that shemeant it.\"All right,\" I said just to test her, \"get in the car.\"She vacillated for an instant. Then she stood silently and faced her house. Sheput her clasped hands just below her navel. She turned and faced the valley anddid the same movement with her hands.I knew what she was doing. She was saying good-bye to her house and to thoseawesome round hills that surrounded it.Don Juan had taught me that good-bye gesture years before. He had stressed thatit was an extremely powerful gesture, and that a warrior had to use itsparingly. I had had very few occasions to perform it myself.The good-bye movement la Gorda was executing was a variant of the one don Juanhad taught me. He had said that the hands were clasped as in prayer, eithergently or with great speed, even producing a clapping sound. Done either way,the purpose of clasping the hands was to imprison the feeling that the warriordid not wish to leave behind. As soon as the hands had closed in and capturedthat feeling, they were taken with great force to the middle of the chest, atthe level of the heart. There the feeling became a dagger and the warriorstabbed himself with it, as if holding the dagger with both hands.Don Juan had told me that a warrior said good-bye in that fashion only when hehad reason to feel he might not come back.La Gorda's good-bye enthralled me.\"Are you saying good-bye?\" I asked out of curiosity.\"Yes,\" she said dryly.\"Don't you put your hands to your chest?\" I asked.\"Men do that. Women have wombs. They store their feelings there.\"\"Aren't you suppose to say good-bye like that only when you're not coming back?\"I asked.\"Chances are I may not come back,\" she replied. \"I'm going with you.\"I had an attack of unwarranted sadness; unwarranted in the sense that I did notknow that woman at all. I had only doubts and suspicions about her. But as Ipeered into her clear eyes, I had a sense of ultimate kinship with her. Imellowed. My anger had disappeared and had given way to a strange sadness. Ilooked around, and I knew that those mysterious, enormous, round hills wereripping me apart.\"Those hills over there are alive,\" she said, reading my thoughts.I turned to her and told her that both the place and the women had affected meat a very deep level, a level I could not ordinarily conceive. I did not knowwhich was more devastating, the place or the women. The women's onslaughts hadbeen direct and terrifying, but the effect of those hills was a constant,nagging apprehension; a desire to flee from them. When I told that to la Gordashe said that I was correct in assessing the effect of that place; that theNagual had left them there because of that effect, and that I should not blameanyone for what had happened because the Nagual himself had given those womenorders to try to do away with me.\"Did he give orders like that to you too?\" I asked.\"No, not to me. I'm different than they are,\" she said. \"They are sisters. Theyare the same, exactly the same. Just like Pablito, Nestor and Benigno are thesame. Only you and I can be exactly the same. We are not now because you'restill 'incomplete'. But someday we will be the same; exactly the same.\"\"I've been told that you're the only one who knows where the Nagual and Genaroare now,\" I said.She peered at me for a moment, and shook her head affirmatively.\"That's right,\" she said. \"I know where they are. The Nagual told me to take youthere if I can.\"I told her to stop beating around the bush and to reveal their exact whereaboutsto me immediately. My demand seemed to plunge her into chaos. She apologized andreassured me that later on, when we were on our way, she would discloseeverything to me. She begged me not to ask her about them anymore because shehad strict orders not to mention anything until the right moment.Lidia and Josefina came to the door and stared at me. I hurriedly got in thecar. La Gorda got in after me, and as she did I could not help observing thatshe had entered the car as she would have entered a tunnel. She sort of crawledin.Don Juan used to do that. I jokingly said to him once, after I had seen him doit scores of times, that it was more functional to get in the way I did. Ithought that perhaps his lack of familiarity with automobiles was responsiblefor his strange way of entering. He explained then that the car was a cave andthat caves had to be entered in that fashion if we were going to use them. Therewas an inherent spirit to caves, whether they were natural or man-made, and thatthat spirit had to be approached with respect. Crawling was the only way ofshowing that respect.I was wondering whether or not to ask la Gorda if don Juan had instructed herabout such details, but she spoke first. She said that the Nagual had given herspecific instructions about what to do in case I would survive the attacks ofdona Soledad and the three girls. Then she casually added that before I headedfor Mexico City we had to go to a specific place in the mountains where don Juanand I used to go, and that there she would reveal all the information the Nagualhad never disclosed to me.I had a moment of indecision, and then something in me which was not my reasonmade me head for the mountains. We drove in complete silence. I attempted atvarious opportune moments to start up a conversation, but she turned me downevery time with a strong shake of her head. Finally she seemed to have gottentired of my trying, and said forcefully that what she had to say required aplace of power and until we were in one we had to abstain from drainingourselves with useless talk.After a long drive and an exhausting hike away from the road, we finally reachedour destination. It was late afternoon. We were in a deep canyon. The bottom ofit was already dark, while the sun was still shining on the top of the mountainsabove it. We walked until we came to a small cave a few feet up the north sideof the canyon which ran from east to west. I used to spend a great deal of timethere with don Juan.Before we entered the cave, la Gorda carefully swept the floor with branches theway don Juan used to in order to clear the ticks and parasites from the rocks.Then she cut a large heap of small branches with soft leaves from thesurrounding bushes and placed them on the rock floor like a mat.She motioned me to enter. I had always let don Juan enter first as a sign ofrespect. I wanted to do the same with her, but she declined. She said I was theNagual. I crawled into the cave the same way she had crawled into my car. Ilaughed at my inconsistency. I had never been able to treat my car as a cave.She coaxed me to relax and make myself comfortable.\"The reason the Nagual could not reveal all his designs to you was becauseyou're incomplete,\" la Gorda said all of a sudden. \"You still are, but now afteryour bouts with Soledad and the sisters, you are stronger than before.\"\"What's the meaning of being incomplete? Everyone has told me that you're theonly one who can explain that,\" I said.\"It's a very simple matter,\" she said. \"A complete person is one who has neverhad children.\"She paused as if she were allowing me time to write down what she had said. Ilooked up from my notes. She was staring at me; judging the effect of her words.\"I know that the Nagual told you exactly what I've just said,\" she continued.\"You didn't pay any attention to him and you probably haven't paid any attentionto me either.\"I read my notes out loud and repeated what she had said. She giggled.\"The Nagual said that an incomplete person is one who has had children,\" shesaid as if dictating to me.She scrutinized me, apparently waiting for a question or a comment. I had none.\"Now I've told you everything about being complete and incomplete,\" she said.\"And I've told you just like the Nagual told me. It didn't mean anything to meat that time, and it doesn't mean anything to you now.\"I had to laugh at the way she patterned herself after don Juan.\"An incomplete person has a hole in the stomach,\" she went on. \"A sorcerer cansee it as plainly as you can see my head. When the hole is on the left side ofone's stomach, the child who created that hole is of the same sex. If it is onthe right side, the child is of the opposite sex. The hole on the left side isblack, the one on the right is dark brown.\"\"Can you see that hole in anyone who has had children?\"\"Sure. There are two ways of seeing it. A sorcerer may see it in dreaming or bylooking directly at a person. A sorcerer who sees has no problems in viewing theluminous being to find out if there is a hole in the luminosity of the body. Buteven if the sorcerer doesn't know how to see, he can look and actuallydistinguish the darkness of the hole through the clothing.\"She stopped talking. I urged her to go on.\"The Nagual told me that you write and then you don't remember what you wrote,\"she said with a tone of accusation.I became entangled in words trying to defend myself. Nonetheless, what she hadsaid was the truth. Don Juan's words always had had a double effect on me: oncewhen I heard for the first time whatever he had said, and then when I read athome whatever I had written down and had forgotten about.Talking to la Gorda, however, was intrinsically different. Don Juan'sapprentices were not in any way as engulfing as he was. Their revelations,although extraordinary, were only missing pieces to a jigsaw puzzle. The unusualcharacter of those pieces was that with them the picture did not become clearerbut that it became more and more complex.\"You had a brown hole in the right side of your stomach,\" she continued. \"Thatmeans that a woman emptied you. You made a female child.\"The Nagual said that I had a huge black hole myself, because I made two women.I never saw the hole, but I've seen other people with holes like mine.\"\"You said that I had a hole. Don't I have it anymore?\"\"No. It's been patched. The Nagual helped you to patch it. Without his help youwould be more empty than you are now.\"\"What kind of patch is it?\"\"A patch in your luminosity. There is no other way of saying it. The Nagual saidthat a sorcerer like himself can fill up the hole anytime; but that filling isonly a patch without luminosity. Anyone who sees or does dreaming can tell thatit looks like a lead patch on the yellow luminosity of the rest of the body.\"The Nagual patched you and me and Soledad. But then he left it up to us to putback the shine, the luminosity.\"\"How did he patch us?\"\"He's a sorcerer, he put things in our bodies. He replaced us. We are no longerthe same. The patch is what he put there himself.\"\"But how did he put those things there and what were they?\"\"What he put in our bodies was his own luminosity and he used his hand to dothat. He simply reached into our bodies and left his fibers there. He did thesame with all of his six children and also with Soledad. All of them are thesame. Except Soledad; she's something else.\"La Gorda seemed unwilling to go on. She vacillated and almost began to stutter.\"What is dona Soledad?\" I insisted.\"It's very hard to tell,\" she said after considerable coaxing. \"She is the sameas you and me, and yet she's different. She has the same luminosity, but she'snot together with us. She goes in the opposite direction. Right now she's morelike you. Both of you have patches that look like lead.Mine is gone and I'm again a complete, luminous egg. That is the reason I saidthat you and I will be exactly the same someday when you become complete again.Right now what makes us almost the same is the Nagual's luminosity and the factthat both of us are going in the same direction and that we both were empty.\"\"What does a complete person look like to a sorcerer?\" I asked.\"Like a luminous egg made out of fibers,\" she said. \"All the fibers arecomplete. They look like strings; taut strings. It looks as if the strings havebeen tightened like a drum is tightened.\"On an empty person, on the other hand, the fibers are crumpled up at the edgesof the hole. When they have had many children, the fibers don't look like fibersanymore. Those people look like two chunks of luminosity, separated byblackness. It is an awesome sight. The Nagual made me see them one day when wewere in a park in the city.\"\"Why do you think the Nagual never told me about all this?\"\"He told you everything, but you never understood him correctly. As soon as herealized that you were not understanding what he was saying, he was compelled tochange the subject. Your emptiness prevented you from understanding.The Nagual said that it was perfectly natural for you not to understand. Once aperson becomes incomplete he's actually empty like a gourd that has beenhollowed out. It didn't matter to you how many times he told you that you wereempty. It didn't matter that he even explained it to you. You never knew what hemeant, or worse yet, you didn't want to know.\"La Gorda was treading on dangerous ground. I tried to head her off with anotherquestion, but she rebuffed me.\"You love a little boy and you don't want to understand what the Nagual meant,\"she said accusingly. \"The Nagual told me that you have a daughter you've neverseen; and that you love that little boy. One took your edge, the other pinnedyou down. You have welded them together.\"I had to stop writing. I crawled out of the cave and stood up. I began to walkdown the steep incline to the floor of the gully. La Gorda followed me. Sheasked me if I was upset by her directness. I did not want to lie.\"What do you think?\" I asked.\"You're fuming!\" she exclaimed and giggled with an abandon that I had witnessedonly in don Juan and don Genaro.She seemed about to lose her balance and grabbed my left arm. In order to helpher get down to the floor of the gully, I lifted her up by her waist. I thoughtthat she could not have weighed more than a hundred pounds. She puckered herlips the way don Genaro used to and said that her weight was a hundred andfifteen. We both laughed at once. It was a moment of direct, instantcommunication.\"Why does it bother you so much to talk about these things?\" she asked.I told her that once I had had a little boy whom I had loved immensely. I feltthe imperative to tell her about him. Some extravagant need beyond mycomprehension made me open up with that woman who was a total stranger to me.As I began to talk about that little boy, a wave of nostalgia enveloped me;perhaps it was the place or the situation or the time of the day. Somehow I hadmerged the memory of that little boy with the memory of don Juan, and for thefirst time in all the time I had not seen him, I missed don Juan.Lidia had said that they never missed him because he was always with them. Hewas their bodies and their spirits. I had known instantly what she meant. I feltthe same way myself. In that gully, however, an unknown feeling had overtakenme. I told la Gorda that I had never missed don Juan until that moment. She didnot answer. She looked away.Possibly my feeling of longing for those two people had to do with the fact thatboth of them had produced catharsises [* catharsis- a purging of emotionaltensions] in my life. And both of them were gone. I had not realized until thatmoment how final that separation was. I said to la Gorda that that little boyhad been, more than anything else, my friend, and that one day he was whiskedaway by forces I could not control. That was perhaps one of the greatest blows I had ever received. I even went tosee don Juan to ask his assistance. It was the only time I had ever asked himfor help. He listened to my plea and then he broke into uproarious laughter. Hisreaction was so unexpected that I could not even get angry. I could only commenton what I thought was his insensitivity.\"What do you want me to do?\" he asked.I said that since he was a sorcerer perhaps he could help me to regain my littlefriend for my solace.\"You're wrong. A warrior doesn't seek anything for his solace,\" he said in atone that did not admit reproach.Then he proceeded to smash my arguments. He said that a warrior could notpossibly leave anything to chance; that a warrior actually affected the outcomeof events by the force of his awareness and his unbending intent. He said thatif I would have had the unbending intent to keep and help that child, I wouldhave taken measures to assure his stay with me.But as it was, my love was merely a word; a useless outburst of an empty man. Hethen told me something about emptiness and completeness, but I did not want tohear it. All I felt was a sense of loss; and the emptiness that he hadmentioned, I was sure, referred to the feeling of having lost someoneirreplaceable.\"You loved him, you honored his spirit, you wished him well, and now you mustforget him,\" he said.But I had not been able to do so. There was something terribly alive in myemotions even though time had mellowed them. At one point I thought I hadforgotten, but then one night an incident produced the deepest emotionalupheaval in me.I was walking to my office when a young Mexican woman approached me. She hadbeen sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus. She wanted to know if thatparticular bus went to a children's hospital. I did not know. She explained thather little boy had had a high temperature for a long time and she was worriedbecause she did not have any money. I moved toward the bench and saw a littleboy standing on the seat with his head against the back of the bench. He waswearing a jacket and short pants and a cap. He could not have been more than twoyears old. He must have seen me, for he walked to the edge of the bench and puthis head against my leg.\"My little head hurts,\" he said to me in Spanish.His voice was so tiny and his dark eyes so sad that a wave of irrepressibleanguish welled up in me. I picked him up and drove him and his mother to thenearest hospital. I left them there and gave the mother enough money to pay thebill.But I did not want to stay or to know any more about him. I wanted to believethat I had helped him, and that by doing so I had paid back to the spirit ofman.I had learned the magical act of \"paying back to the spirit of man\" from donJuan. I had asked him once, overwhelmed by the realization that I could neverpay him back for all he had done for me, if there was anything in the world Icould do to even the score. We were leaving a bank, after exchanging someMexican currency.\"I don't need you to pay me back,\" he said, \"but if you still want to pay back,make your deposit to the spirit of man. That's always a very small account, andwhatever one puts in it is more than enough.\"By helping that sick child I had merely paid back to the spirit of man for anyhelp that my little boy may receive from strangers along his path. I told la Gorda that my love for him would remain alive for the rest of my lifeeven though I would never see him again. I wanted to tell her that the memory Ihad of him was buried so deep that nothing could touch it, but I desisted. Ifelt it would have been superfluous to talk about it. Besides, it was gettingdark and I wanted to get out of that gully.\"We better go,\" I said. \"I'll take you home. Maybe some other time we can talkabout these things again.\"She laughed the way don Juan used to laugh at me. I had apparently saidsomething utterly funny.\"Why do you laugh, Gorda?\" I asked.\"Because you know yourself that we can't leave this place just like that,\" shesaid. \"You have an appointment with power here. And so do I.\"She walked back to the cave and crawled in.\"Come on in,\" she yelled from inside. \"There is no way to leave.\"I reacted most incongruously. I crawled in and sat next to her again. It wasevident that she too had tricked me. I had not come there to have anyconfrontations. I should have been furious. I was indifferent instead. I couldnot lie to myself that I had only stopped there on my way to Mexico City. I hadgone there compelled by something beyond my comprehension.She handed me my notebook and motioned me to write. She said that if I wrote Iwould not only relax myself but I would also relax her.\"What is this appointment with power?\" I asked.\"The Nagual told me that you and I have an appointment here with something outthere. You first had an appointment with Soledad and then one with the littlesisters. They were supposed to destroy you. The Nagual said that if you survivedtheir assaults I had to bring you here so that we together could keep the thirdappointment.\"\"What kind of appointment is it?\"\"I really don't know. Like everything else, it depends on us. Right now thereare some things out there that have been waiting for you. I say that they havebeen waiting for you because I come here by myself all the time and nothing everhappens. But tonight is different. You are here and those things will come.\"\"Why is the Nagual trying to destroy me?\" I asked.\"He's not trying to destroy anybody!\" la Gorda exclaimed in protest. \"You arehis child. Now he wants you to be himself. More himself than any of us. But tobe a true Nagual you have to claim your power.Otherwise he wouldn't have been so careful in setting up Soledad and the littlesisters to stalk you. He taught Soledad how to change her shape and rejuvenateherself. He made her construct a devilish floor in her room. A floor no one canoppose. You see, Soledad is empty, so the Nagual set her up to do somethinggigantic. He gave her a task, a most difficult and dangerous task, but the onlyone which was suited for her, and that was to finish you off. He told her thatnothing could be more difficult than for one sorcerer to kill another.It's easier for an average man to kill a sorcerer or for a sorcerer to kill anaverage man, but two sorcerers don't fit well at all. The Nagual told Soledadthat her best bet was to surprise you and scare you. And that's what she did.The Nagual set her up to be a desirable woman so she could lure you into herroom, and there her floor would have bewitched you, because as I've said, noone, but no one, can stand up to that floor. That floor was the Nagual'smasterpiece for Soledad. But you did something to her floor and Soledad had tochange her tactics in accordance with the Nagual's instructions. He told herthat if her floor failed and she could not frighten and surprise you, she had totalk to you and tell you everything you wanted to know. The Nagual trained herto talk very well as her last resource. But Soledad could not overpower you evenwith that.\"\"Why was it so important to overpower me? \"She paused and peered at me. She cleared her throat and sat up straight. Shelooked up at the low roof of the cave and exhaled noisily through her nose.\"Soledad is a woman like myself,\" she said. \"I'll tell you something about myown life and maybe you'll understand her.\"I had a man once. He got me pregnant when I was very young and I had twodaughters with him. One after the other. My life was hell. That man was adrunkard and beat me day and night. And I hated him and he hated me. And I gotfat like a pig.\"One day another man came along and told me that he liked me and wanted me to gowith him to work in the city as a paid servant. He knew I was a hardworkingwoman and only wanted to exploit me. But my life was so miserable that I fellfor it and went with him. He was worse than the first man, mean and fearsome. Hecouldn't stand me after a week or so. And he used to give me the worst beatingsyou can imagine. I thought he was going to kill me and he wasn't even drunk, andall because I hadn't found work.\"Then he sent me to beg on the streets with a sick baby. He would pay thechild's mother something from the money I got. And then he would beat me becauseI hadn't made enough. The child got sicker and sicker and I knew that if it diedwhile I was begging, the man would kill me.\"So one day when I knew that he was not there I went to the child's mother andgave her her baby and some of the money I had made that day. That was a luckyday for me. Aind foreign lady had given me fifty pesos to buy medicine for thebaby.\"I had been with that horrible man for three months and I thought it had beentwenty years. I used the money to go back to my home. I was pregnant again. Theman had wanted me to have a child of my own, so that he would not have to payfor one.\"When I got to my hometown I tried to go back to see my children, but they hadbeen taken away by their father's family. All the family got together under thepretense that they wanted to talk to me, but instead they took me to a desertedplace and beat me with sticks and rocks and left me for dead.\"La Gorda showed me the many scars on her scalp.\"To this day I don't know how I made it back to town. I even lost the child Ihad in my womb. I went to an aunt I still had. My parents were dead. She gave mea place to rest and she tended to me. She fed me, the poor soul, for two monthsbefore I could get up.\"\"Then one day my aunt told me that that man was in town looking for me. He hadtalked to the police and had said that he had given me money in advance to workand that I had run away, stealing the money after I had killed a woman's baby. Iknew that the end had come for me.\"But my luck turned right again and I caught a ride in the truck of an American.I saw the truck coming on the road and I lifted my hand in desperation. The manstopped and let me get on. He drove me all the way to this part of Mexico. Hedropped me in the city. I didn't know a soul. I roamed all over the place fordays like a crazy dog; eating garbage from the street. That was when my luckturned for the last time.\"I met Pablito, with whom I have a debt that I can't pay back. Pablito took meto his carpentry shop and gave me a corner there to put my bed. He did thatbecause he felt sorry for me. He found me in the market after he stumbled andfell on top of me.\"I had been sitting there begging. A moth or a bee, I don't know which, flew tohim and hit him in the eye. He turned around on his heels and stumbled, and fellright on top of me. I thought he would be so mad that he would hit me, but hegave me some money instead. I asked him if he could give me work. That was whenhe took me to his shop and set me up with an iron and an ironing board to dolaundry.\"I did very well. Except that I got fatter because most of the people I washedfor fed me with their leftovers. Sometimes I ate sixteen times a day. I didnothing else but eat. Kids in the street used to taunt me and sneak behind meand step on my heels and then someone would push me and I would fall. Those kidsmade me cry with their cruel jokes especially when they used to spoil my wash onpurpose.\"One day, very late in the afternoon while I was alone, a weird old man cameover to see Pablito. I had never seen that man before. I had never known thatPablito was in cahoots with such a scary, awesome man. I turned my back to himand kept on working. Suddenly I felt the hands of that man on my neck. My heartstopped. I could not scream. I couldn't even breathe. I fell down and that awfulman held my head; maybe for an hour.\"Then he left. I was so frightened that I stayed where I had fallen until thenext morning. Pablito found me there. He laughed and said that I should be veryproud and happy because that old man was a powerful sorcerer and was one of histeachers. I was dumbfounded. I couldn't believe Pablito was a sorcerer. He saidthat his teacher had seen a perfect circle of moths flying over my head. He hadalso seen my death circling around me. And that was why he had acted likelightning and had changed the direction of my eyes.\"Pablito also said that the Nagual had laid his hands on me and had reached intomy body and that soon I would be different. I had no idea what he was talkingabout. I had no idea what that crazy old man had done, either.\"But it didn't matter to me. I was like a dog that everyone kicked around.Pablito had been the only person who had been kind to me. At first I had thoughthe wanted me for his woman. But I was too ugly and fat and smelly. He justwanted to be kind to me.\"The crazy old man came back another night and grabbed me again by the neck frombehind. He hurt me terribly. I cried and screamed. I didn't know what he wasdoing. He never said a word to me. I was deathly afraid of him.\"Then, later on he began to talk to me and told me what to do with my life. Iliked what he said. He took me everywhere with him. But my emptiness was myworst enemy. I couldn't accept his ways, so one day he got sick and tired ofpampering me and sent the wind after me.\"I was in the back of Soledad's house by myself that day, and I felt the windgetting very strong. It was blowing through the fence. It got into my eyes. Iwanted to get inside the house, but my body was frightened; and instead ofwalking through the door, I walked through the gate in the fence. The windpushed me and made me twirl. I tried to go back to the house, but it wasuseless. I couldn't break the force of the wind.\"It pushed me over the hills and off the road, and I ended up in a deep hole; ahole like a tomb. The wind kept me there for days and days, until I had decidedto change and accept my fate without recrimination. Then the wind stopped andthe Nagual found me, and took me back to the house.\"He told me that my task was to give what I didn't have, love and affection; andthat I had to take care of the sisters, Lidia and Josefina, better than if theywere myself. I understood then what the Nagual had been saying to me for years.My life had been over a long time ago. He had offered me a new life and thatlife had to be completely new. I couldn't bring to that new life my ugly oldways. That first night he found me, the moths had pointed me out to him; I hadno business rebelling against my fate.\"I began my change by taking care of Lidia and Josefina better than I took careof myself. I did everything the Nagual told me, and one night in this very gullyin this very cave I found my completeness. I had fallen asleep right here whereI am now and then a noise woke me up.\"I looked up and saw myself as I had once been, thin, young, fresh. It was myspirit that was coming back to me. At first it didn't want to come closerbecause I still looked pretty awful. But then it couldn't help itself and cameto me.\"I knew right then, and all at once, what the Nagual had struggled for years totell me. He had said that when one has a child, that child takes the edge of ourspirit. For a woman to have a girl means the end of that edge. To have had twoas I did meant the end of me.\"The best of my strength and my illusions went to those girls. They stole myedge, the Nagual said, in the same way I had stolen it from my parents. That'sour fate.\"A boy steals the biggest part of his edge from his father, a girl from hermother. The Nagual said that people who have had children could tell, if theyaren't as stubborn as you, that something is missing in them. Some craziness,some nervousness, some power that they had before is gone. They used to have it,but where is it now?\"The Nagual said that it is in the little child running around the house, fullof energy, full of illusions; in other words, complete. He said that if we watchchildren we can tell that they are daring. They move in leaps. If we watch theirparents we can see that they are cautious and timid. They don't leap anymore.The Nagual told me we explain that by saying that the parents are grown-ups andhave responsibilities. But that's not true. The truth of the matter is that theyhave lost their edge.\"I asked la Gorda what the Nagual would have said if I had told him that I knewparents with much more spirit and edge than their children.She laughed, covering her face in a gesture of sham embarrassment.She said, giggling, \"You can ask me. Do you want to hear what I think?\"\"Of course I want to hear it.\"\"Those people don't have more spirit, they merely had a lot of vigor to beginwith, and have trained their children to be obedient and meek. They havefrightened their children all their lives; that's all.\"I described to her the case of a man I knew, a father of four, who at the age offifty-three changed his life completely. That entailed leaving his wife and hisexecutive job in a large corporation after more than twenty-five years ofbuilding a career and a family. He chucked it all very daringly, and went tolive on an island in the Pacific.\"You mean he went there all by himself?\" la Gorda asked with a tone of surprise.She had destroyed my argument. I had to admit that the man had gone there withhis twenty-three year old bride.\"Who no doubt is complete,\" la Gorda added.I had to agree with her again.\"An empty man uses the completeness of a woman all the time,\" she went on. \"Acomplete woman is dangerous in her completeness, more so than a man. She isunreliable, moody, nervous; but also capable of great changes. Women like thatcan pick themselves up and go anywhere. They'll do nothing there, but that'sbecause they had nothing going to begin with.\"Empty people, on the other hand, can't jump like that anymore, but they're morereliable. The Nagual said that empty people are like worms that look aroundbefore moving a bit and then they back up and then they move a little bit moreagain. Complete people always jump, somersault, and almost always land on theirheads; but it doesn't matter to them.\"The Nagual said that to enter into the other world one has to be complete. Tobe a sorcerer, one has to have all of one's luminosity: no holes, no patches,and all the edge of the spirit. So a sorcerer who is empty has to regaincompleteness. Man or woman, they must be complete to enter into that world outthere; that eternity where the Nagual and Genaro are now waiting for us.\"She stopped talking and stared at me for a long moment. There was barely enoughlight to write.\"But how did you regain your completeness?\" I asked.She jumped at the sound of my voice. I repeated my question. She stared up atthe roof of the cave before answering me.\"I had to refuse those two girls,\" she said. \"The Nagual once told you how to dothat but you didn't want to hear it. His point was that one has to steal thatedge back. He said that we got it the hard way by stealing it, and that we mustrecover it the same way; the hard way.\"He guided me to do that, and the first thing he made me do was to refuse mylove for those two children. I had to do that in dreaming. Little by little Ilearned not to like them, but the Nagual said that that was useless. One has tolearn not to care and not 'not to like'. Whenever those girls meant nothing tome, I had to see them again; lay my eyes and my hands on them. I had to pat themgently on the head and let my left side snatch the edge out of them.\"\"What happened to them?\"\"Nothing. They never felt a thing. They went home and are now like two grown-uppersons. Empty like most people around them. They don't like the company ofchildren because they have no use for them. I would say that they are betteroff. I took the craziness out of them. They didn't need it; while I did. Ididn't know what I was doing when I gave it to them. Besides, they still retainthe edge they stole from their father.\"The Nagual was right: No one noticed the loss, but I did notice my gain. Thenas I looked out of this cave, I saw all my illusions lined up like a row ofsoldiers. The world was bright and new. The heaviness of my body and my spirithad been lifted off, and I was truly a new being.\"\"Do you know how you took your edge from your children?\"\"They are not my children! I have never had any. Look at me.\"She crawled out of the cave, lifted her skirt and showed me her naked body. Thefirst thing I noticed was how slender and muscular she was.She urged me to come closer and examine her. Her body was so lean and firm thatI had to conclude she could not possibly have had children. She put her rightleg on a high rock and showed me her vagina. Her drive to prove her change wasso intense that I had to laugh to bridge my nervousness. I said that I was not adoctor and therefore I could not tell, but that I was sure she must be right.\"Of course I'm right,\" she said as she crawled back into the cave. \"Nothing hasever come out of this womb.\"After a moment's pause she answered my question, which I had already forgottenunder the onslaught of her display.\"My left side took my edge back,\" she said. \"All I did was to go and visit thegirls. I went there four or five times to allow them time to feel at ease withme. They were big girls and were going to school.\"I thought I would have to fight not to like them, but the Nagual said that itdidn't matter; that I should like them if I wanted to. So I liked them. But myliking them was just like liking a stranger. My mind was made up. My purpose wasunbending. I want to enter into the other world while I'm still alive; as theNagual told me. In order to do that I need all the edge of my spirit. I need mycompleteness. Nothing can turn me away from that world! Nothing!\"She stared at me defiantly.\"You have to refuse both, the woman who emptied you, and the little boy who hasyour love if you are seeking your completeness. The woman you can easily refuse.The little boy is something else. Do you think that your useless affection forthat child is so worthy as to keep you from entering into that realm?\"I had no answer. It was not that I wanted to think it over. It was rather that Ihad become utterly confused.\"Soledad has to take her edge out of Pablito if she wants to enter into thenagual,\" she went on. \"How in the hell is she going to do that? Pablito, nomatter how weak he is, is a sorcerer.\"But the Nagual gave Soledad a unique chance. He said to her that her onlymoment would come when you walked into the house, and for that moment he notonly made us move out into the other house, but he made us help her widen thepath to the house so you could drive your car to the very door. He told her thatif she lived an impeccable life she would bag you, and suck away all yourluminosity, which is all the power the Nagual left inside your body. That wouldnot be difficult for her to do. Since she's going in the opposite direction, shecould drain you to nothing. Her great feat was to lead you to a moment ofhelplessness.\"Once she had killed you, your luminosity would have increased her power and shewould then have come after us. I was the only one who knew that. Lidia, Josefinaand Rosa love her. I don't. I knew what her designs were. She would have takenus one by one, in her own time, since she had nothing to lose and everything togain.\"The Nagual said to me that there was no other way for her. He entrusted me withthe girls and told me what to do in case Soledad killed you and came after ourluminosity. He figured that I had a chance to save myself and to save perhapsone of the three. You see, Soledad is not a bad woman at all. She's simply doingwhat an impeccable warrior would do. The little sisters like her more than theylike their own mothers. She's a real mother to them.\"That was, the Nagual said, the point of her advantage. I haven't been able topull the little sisters away from her no matter what I do. So if she had killedyou, she would then have taken at least two of those three trusting souls. Thenwithout you in the picture Pablito is nothing. Soledad would have squashed himlike a bug. And then with all her completeness and power she would have enteredinto that world out there. If I had been in her place I would've tried to doexactly as she did.\"So you see, it was all or nothing for her. When you first arrived everyone wasgone. It looked as if it was the end for you and for some of us; but then at theend it was nothing for her and a chance for the sisters. The moment I knew thatyou had succeeded, I told the three girls that now it was their turn. The Nagualhad said that they should wait until the morning to catch you unawares. He saidthat the morning was not a good time for you. He commanded me to stay away andnot interfere with the sisters, and to come in only if you would try to injuretheir luminosity.\"\"Were they supposed to kill me too?\"\"Well, yes. You are the male side of their luminosity. Their completeness is attimes their disadvantage. The Nagual ruled them with an iron hand and balancedthem; but now that he's gone, they have no way of leveling off. Your luminositycould do that for them.\"\"How about you, Gorda? Are you supposed to finish me off too?\"\"I've told you already that I'm different. I am balanced. My emptiness, whichwas my disadvantage, is now my advantage. Once a sorcerer regains hiscompleteness he's balanced; while a sorcerer who was always complete is a bitoff. Like Genaro was a bit off. But the Nagual was balanced because he had beenincomplete like you and me- even more so than you and me. He had three sons andone daughter.\"The little sisters are like Genaro, a bit off. And most of the times so tautthat they have no measure.\"\"How about me, Gorda? Do I also have to go after them?\"\"No. Only they could have profited by sucking away your luminosity. You can'tprofit at all by anyone's death. The Nagual left a special power with you; abalance of some kind, which none of us has.\"\"Can't they learn to have that balance?\"\"Sure they can. But that has nothing to do with the task the little sisters hadto perform. Their task was to steal your power. For that, they became so unitedthat they are now one single being. They trained themselves to sip you up like aglass of soda.\"The Nagual set them up to be deceivers of the highest order, especiallyJosefina. She put on a show that was peerless. Compared to their art, Soledad'sattempt was child's play. She's a crude woman. The little sisters are truesorceresses.\"Two of them gained your confidence, while the third shocked you and renderedyou helpless. They played their cards to perfection. You fell for it all andnearly succumbed. The only flaw was that you injured and cured Rosa's luminositythe night before and that made her jumpy. Had it not been for her nervousnessand her biting your side so hard, chances are you wouldn't be here now. I saweverything from the door. I came in at the precise moment you were about toannihilate them.\"\"But what could I do to annihilate them?\"\"How could I know that? I'm not you.\"\"I mean what did you see me doing?\"\"I saw your double coming out of you.\"\"What did it look like?\"\"It looked like you, what else? But it was very big and menacing. Your doublewould have killed them. So I came in and interfered with it. It took the best ofmy power to calm you down. The sisters were no help. They were lost. And youwere furious and violent. You changed colors right in front of us twice. Onecolor was so violent that I feared you would kill me too.\"\"What color was it, Gorda?\"\"White, what else? The double is white, yellowish white, like the sun.\"I stared at her. The simile [* simile- a figure of speech that expresses aresemblance between things of different kinds] was very new to me.\"Yes,\" she continued, \"we are pieces of the sun. That is why we are luminousbeings. But our eyes can't see that luminosity because it is very faint. Onlythe eyes of a sorcerer can see it, and that happens after a lifetime struggle.\"Her revelation had taken me by total surprise. I tried to reorganize my thoughtsin order to ask the most appropriate question.\"Did the Nagual ever tell you anything about the sun?\" I asked.\"Yes. We are all like the sun but very, very faint. Our light is too weak, butit is light anyway.\"\"But, did he say that the sun was perhaps the nagual?\" I insisted desperately.La Gorda did not answer. She made a series of involuntary noises with her lips.She was apparently thinking how to answer my probe. I waited, ready to write itdown. After a long pause she crawled out of the cave.\"I'll show you my faint light,\" she said matter-of-factly.She walked to the center of the narrow gully in front of the cave and squatted.From where I was I could not see what she was doing so I had to get out of thecave myself. I stood ten or twelve feet away from her. She put her hands underher skirt while she was still squatting.Suddenly, she stood up. Her hands were loosely clasped into fists. She raisedthem over her head and snapped her fingers open. I heard a quick bursting soundand I saw sparks flying from her fingers. She again clasped her hands and thensnapped them open and another volley of much larger sparks flew out of them.She squatted once more and reached under her skirt. She seemed to be pullingsomething from her pubis. She repeated the snapping movement of her fingers asshe threw her hands over her head, and I saw a spray of long, luminous fibersflying away from her fingers. I had to tilt my head up to see them against thealready dark sky. They appeared to be long, fine filaments of a reddish light.After a while they faded and disappeared.She squatted once again, and when she let her fingers open a most astonishingdisplay of lights emanated from them. The sky was filled with thick rays oflight. It was a spellbinding sight. I became engrossed in it. My eyes werefixed. I was not paying attention to la Gorda. I was looking at the lights.I heard a sudden outcry that forced me to look at her- just in time to see hergrab one of the lines she was creating and spin to the very top of the canyon.She hovered there for an instant like a huge dark shadow against the sky, andthen she descended to the bottom of the gully; in spurts, or small leaps, or asif she were coming down a stairway on her belly.I suddenly saw her standing over me. I had not realized that I had fallen on myseat. I stood up. She was soaked in perspiration and was panting; trying tocatch her breath. She could not speak for a long time. She began to jog inplace. I did not dare to touch her. Finally she seemed to have calmed downenough to crawl back into the cave. She rested for a few minutes.Her actions had been so fast that I had hardly had any time to evaluate what hadhappened. At the moment of her display, I had felt an unbearable ticklish painin the area just below my navel. I had not physically exerted myself, and yet Iwas also panting.\"I think it's time to go to our appointment,\" she said, out of breath. \"Myflying opened us both. You felt my flying in your belly. That means you are openand ready to meet the four forces.\"\"What four forces are you talking about?\"\"The Nagual's and Genaro's allies. You've seen them. They are horrendous. Nowthey are free from the Nagual's and Genaro's gourds. You heard one of themaround Soledad's house the other night. They are waiting for you. The moment thedarkness of the day sets in, they'll be uncontainable. One of them even cameafter you in the daytime at Soledad's place. Those allies now belong to you andme. We will take two each. I don't know which ones. And I don't know how,either. All the Nagual told me was that you and I would have to tackle them byourselves.\"\"Wait, wait! \" I shouted.She did not let me speak. She gently put her hand over my mouth. I felt a pangof terror in the pit of my stomach. I had been confronted in the past with someinexplicable phenomena which don Juan and don Genaro had called their allies.There were four of them and they were entities, as real as anything in theworld. Their presence was so outlandish that it would create an unparalleledstate of fear in me every time I perceived them.The first one I had encountered was don Juan's. It was a dark, rectangular mass,eight or nine feet high and four or five feet across. It moved with the crushingweight of a giant boulder and breathed so heavily that it reminded me of thesound of bellows. I had always encountered it at night in the darkness. I hadfancied it to be like a door that walked by pivoting on one corner and then onthe other.The second ally I came across was don Genaro's. It was a long-faced,bald-headed, extraordinarily tall, glowing man, with thick lips and enormous,droopy eyes. He always wore pants that were too short for his long, skinny legs.I had seen those two allies a great many times while in the company of don Juanand don Genaro. The sight of them would invariably cause an irreconcilableseparation between my reason and my perception. On the one hand, I had norational ground whatsoever to believe that what was happening to me was actuallytaking place, and on the other hand, there was no possible way of discarding thetruthfulness of my perception.Since they had always appeared while don Juan and don Genaro were around, I hadfiled them away as products of the powerful influence that those two men had hadon my suggestible personality. In my understanding it was either that, or thatdon Juan and don Genaro had in their possession forces they called their allies;forces which were capable of manifesting themselves to me as those horrendousentities.A feature of the allies was that they never allowed me to scrutinize themthoroughly. I had tried various times to focus my undivided attention on them,but every time I would get dizzy and disassociated.The other two allies were more elusive. I had seen them only once, a giganticblack jaguar with yellow glowing eyes, and a ravenous, enormous coyote. The twobeasts were ultimately aggressive and overpowering. The jaguar was don Genaro'sand the coyote was don Juan's.La Gorda crawled out of the cave. I followed her as she led the way. We walkedout of the gully and reached a long rocky plain. She stopped and let me stepahead. I told her that if she was going to let me lead us I was going to try toget to the car.She shook her head affirmatively and clung to me. I could feel her clammy skin.She seemed to be in a state of great agitation. It was perhaps a mile to wherewe had left the car, and to reach it we had to cross the deserted rocky plain.Don Juan had shown me a hidden trail among some big boulders almost on the sideof the mountain that flanked the plain toward the east. I headed for that trail.Some unknown urge was guiding me, otherwise I would have taken the same trail wehad taken before when we had crossed the plain on the level ground.La Gorda seemed to be anticipating something awesome. She grabbed onto me. Hereyes were wild.\"Are we going the right way?\" I asked.She did not answer. She pulled her shawl and twisted it until it looked like along, thick rope. She encircled my waist with it, crossed over the ends andencircled herself. She tied a knot and thus had us bound together in a band thatlooked like a figure eight.\"What did you do this for?\" I asked.She shook her head. Her teeth chattered but she could not say a word. Her frightseemed to be extreme. She pushed me to keep on walking. I could not helpwondering why I was not scared out of my wits myself.As we reached the high trail the physical exertion began to take its toll on me.I was wheezing and had to breathe through my mouth. I could see the shape of thebig boulders. There was no moon but the sky was so clear that there was enoughlight to distinguish shapes. I could hear la Gorda also wheezing.I tried to stop to catch my breath but she pushed me gently as she shook herhead negatively. I wanted to make a joke to break the tension when I heard astrange thumping noise.My head moved involuntarily to my right to allow my left ear to scan the area. Istopped breathing for an instant and then I clearly heard that someone elsebesides la Gorda and myself was breathing heavily. I checked again to make surebefore I told her. There was no doubt that that massive shape was there amongthe boulders.I put my hand on la Gorda's mouth as we kept on moving and signaled her to holdher breath. I could tell that the massive shape was very close. It seemed to besliding as quietly as it could. It was wheezing softly.La Gorda was startled. She squatted and pulled me down with her by the shawltied around my waist. She put her hands under her skirt for a moment and thenstood up. Her hands were clasped and when she snapped her fingers open a volleyof sparks flew from them.\"Piss in your hands,\" la Gorda whispered through clenched teeth.\"Hub?\" I said, unable to comprehend what she wanted me to do.She whispered her order three or four times with increasing urgency. She musthave realized I did not know what she wanted, for she squatted again and showedthat she was urinating in her hands. I stared at her dumbfounded as she made herurine fly like reddish sparks.My mind went blank. I did not know which was more absorbing, the sight la Gordawas creating with her urine, or the wheezing of the approaching entity. I couldnot decide on which of the two stimuli to focus my attention; both wereenthralling.\"Quickly! Do it in your hands!\" la Gorda grumbled between her teeth.I heard her, but my attention was dislocated. With an imploring voice la Gordaadded that my sparks would make the approaching creature, whatever it was,retreat. She began to whine and I began to feel desperate. I could not only hearbut I could sense with my whole body the approaching entity.I tried to urinate in my hands. My effort was useless. I was too self-consciousand nervous. I became possessed by la Gorda's agitation and struggleddesperately to urinate. I finally did it. I snapped my fingers three or fourtimes, but nothing flew out of them.\"Do it again,\" la Gorda said. \"It takes a while to make sparks.\"I told her that I had used up all the urine I had. There was the most intenselook of despair in her eyes.At that instant I saw the massive rectangular shape moving toward us. Somehow itdid not seem menacing to me; although la Gorda was about to faint out of fear.Suddenly she untied her shawl and leaped onto a small rock that was behind meand hugged me from behind, putting her chin on my head. She had practicallyclimbed on my shoulders. The instant that we adopted that position the shapeceased moving. It kept on wheezing, perhaps twenty feet away from us.I felt a giant tension that seemed to be focused in my midsection. After a whileI knew without the shadow of a doubt that if we remained in that position wewould have drained our energy and fallen prey to whatever was stalking us.I told her that we were going to run for our lives. She shook her headnegatively. She seemed to have regained her strength and confidence. She saidthen that we had to bury our heads in our arms and lie down with our thighsagainst our stomachs.I remembered then that years before don Juan had made me do the same thing onenight when I was caught in a deserted field in northern Mexico by somethingequally unknown and yet equally real to my senses. At that time don Juan hadsaid that fleeing was useless and the only thing one could do was to remain onthe spot in the position la Gorda had just prescribed.I was about to kneel down when I had the unexpected feeling that we had made aterrible mistake in leaving the cave. We had to go back to it at any cost.I looped la Gorda's shawl over my shoulders and under my arms. I asked her tohold the tips above my head, climb to my shoulders and stand on them, bracingherself by pulling up the ends of the shawl and fastening it like a harness.Years before don Juan had told me that one should meet strange events, such asthe rectangular shape in front of us, with unexpected actions. He said that oncehe himself stumbled upon a deer that \"talked\" to him, and he had stood on hishead for the duration of that event as a means of assuring his survival and toease the strain of such an encounter.My idea was to try to walk around the rectangular shape, back to the cave, withla Gorda standing on my shoulders.She whispered that the cave was out of the question. The Nagual had told her notto remain there at all. I argued, as I fixed the shawl for her, that my body hadthe certainty that in the cave we would be all right. She replied that that wastrue, and it would work except that we had no means whatever to control thoseforces. We needed a special container, a gourd of some sort, like those I hadseen dangling from don Juan's and don Genaro's belts.She took off her shoes and climbed on my shoulders and stood there. I held herby her calves. As she pulled on the ends of the shawl I felt the tension of theband under my armpits. I waited until she had gained her balance. To walk in thedarkness carrying one hundred and fifteen pounds on my shoulders was no meanfeat. I went very slowly. I counted twenty-three paces and I had to put herdown. The pain on my shoulder blades was unbearable. I told her that althoughshe was very slender, her weight was crushing my collarbone.The interesting part, however, was that the rectangular shape was no longer insight. Our strategy had worked. La Gorda suggested that she carry me on hershoulders for a stretch. I found the idea ludicrous. My weight was more thanwhat her small frame could stand. We decided to walk for a while and see whathappened.There was a dead silence around us. We walked slowly, bracing each other. We hadmoved no more than a few yards when I again began to hear strange breathingnoises, a soft, prolonged hissing like the hissing of a feline. I hurriedlyhelped her to get back on my shoulders and walked another ten paces.I knew we had to maintain the unexpected as a tactic if we wanted to get out ofthat place. I was trying to figure out another set of unexpected actions wecould use instead of la Gorda standing on my shoulders, when she took off herlong dress. In one single movement she was naked. She scrambled on the groundlooking for something.I heard a cracking sound and she stood up holding a branch from a low bush. Shemanoeuvred her shawl around my shoulders and neck and made a sort of ridingsupport where she could sit with her legs wrapped around my waist, like a childriding piggyback. She then put the branch inside her dress and held it above herhead. She began to twirl the branch, giving the dress a strange bounce. To thateffect she added a whistle, imitating the peculiar cry of a night owl.After a hundred yards or so I heard the same sounds coming from behind us andfrom the sides. She changed to another birdcall, a piercing sound similar tothat made by a peacock. A few minutes later the same birdcalls were echoing allaround us.I had witnessed a similar phenomenon of birdcalls being answered, years beforewith don Juan. I had thought at the time that perhaps the sounds were beingproduced by don Juan who was hiding nearby in the darkness; or even by someoneclosely associated with him, such as don Genaro, who was aiding him in creatingan insurmountable fear in me; a fear that made me run in total darkness withouteven stumbling. Don Juan had called that particular action of running indarkness the 'gait of power'.I asked la Gorda if she knew how to do the gait of power. She said yes. I toldher that we were going to try it even though I was not at all sure I could doit. She said that it was neither the time nor the place for that, and pointed infront of us. My heart, which had been beating fast all along, began to poundwildly inside my chest.Right ahead of us, perhaps ten feet away, and smack in the middle of the trailwas one of don Genaro's allies; the strange glowing man with the long face andthe bald head. I froze on the spot. I heard la Gorda's shriek as though it werecoming from far away. She frantically pounded on my sides with her fists.Her action broke my fixation on the man. She turned my head to the left and thento the right. On my left side, almost touching my leg, was the black mass of agiant feline with glaring yellow eyes. To my right I saw an enormousphosphorescent coyote. Behind us, almost touching la Gorda's back, was the darkrectangular shape.The man turned his back to us and began to move on the trail. I also began towalk. La Gorda kept on shrieking and whining. The rectangular shape was almostgrabbing her back. I heard it moving with crushing thumps. The sound of itssteps reverberated on the hills around us. I could feel its cold breath on myneck.I knew that la Gorda was about to go mad. And so was I. The feline and thecoyote were almost rubbing my legs. I could hear their hissing and growlingincreasing in volume. I had, at that moment, the irrational urge to make acertain sound don Juan had taught me. The allies answered me. I kept onfrantically making the sound and they answered me back. The tension diminishedby degrees, and before we reached the road I was part of a most extravagantscene.La Gorda was riding piggyback, happily bouncing her dress over her head as ifnothing had ever happened. She was keeping the bounces in rhythm with the soundI was making; while four creatures of another world answered me back as theymoved at my pace, flanking us on all four sides.We got to the road in that fashion, but I did not want to leave. There seemed tobe something missing. I stayed motionless with la Gorda on my back, and made avery special tapping sound don Juan had taught me. He had said that it was thecall of moths. In order to produce it one had to use the inside edge of the lefthand and the lips.As soon as I made it everything seemed to come to rest peacefully. The fourentities answered me, and as they did I knew which were the ones that would gowith me.I then walked to the car and eased la Gorda off my back onto the driver's seatand pushed her over to her side. We drove away in absolute silence. Somethinghad touched me somewhere and my thoughts had been turned off.La Gorda suggested that we go to don Genaro's place instead of driving to herhouse. She said that Benigno, Nestor ami Pablito lived there, but were out oftown. Her suggestion appealed to me.Once we were in the house la Gorda lit a lantern. The place looked just as ithad the last time I had visited don Genaro. We sat on the floor. I pulled up abench and put my writing pad on it. I was not tired and I wanted to write, but Icould not do it. I could not write at all.\"What did the Nagual tell you about the allies?\" I asked.My question seemed to catch her off guard. She did not know how to answer.\"I can't think,\" she finally said.It was as though she had never experienced that state before. She paced back andforth in front of me. Tiny beads of perspiration had formed on the tip of hernose and on her upper lip.She suddenly grabbed me by the hand and practically pulled me out of the house.She led me to a nearby ravine and there she got sick.My stomach felt queasy. She said that the pull of the allies had been too greatand that I should force myself to throw up. I stared at her, waiting for afurther explanation. She took my head in her hands and stuck her finger down mythroat with the certainty of a nurse dealing with a child, and actually made mevomit.She explained that human beings had a very delicate glow around the stomach andthat that glow was always being pulled by everything around. At times when thepull was too great, as in the case of contact with the allies, or even in thecase of contact with strong people, the glow would become agitated, change coloror even fade altogether. In such instances the only thing one could do wassimply to throw up.I felt better, but not quite myself yet. I had a sense of tiredness, ofheaviness around my eyes. We walked back to the house. As we reached the door laGorda sniffed the air like a dog, and said that she knew which allies were mine.Her statement, which ordinarily would have had no other significance than theone she alluded to, or the one I myself read into it, had the special quality ofa cathartic [* cathartic- emotionally purging] device. It made me explode intothoughts. All at once, my usual intellectual deliberations came into being. Ifelt myself leaping in the air as if thoughts had an energy of their own.The first thought that came to my mind was that the allies were actual entities;as I had suspected without ever daring to admit- even to myself. I had seen themand felt them and communicated with them. I was euphoric. I embraced la Gordaand began to explain to her the crux of my intellectual dilemma.I had seen the allies without the aid of don Juan or don Genaro and that actmade all the difference in the world to me. I told la Gorda that once when I hadreported to don Juan that I had seen one of the allies, he had laughed and urgedme not to take myself so seriously, and to disregard what I had seen.I had never wanted to believe I was having hallucinations, but I did not want toaccept that there were allies either. My rational background was unbending. Icould not bridge the gap.This time, however, everything was different, and the thought that there wereactually beings on this earth that were from another world without being aliensto the earth was more than I could bear. I said to la Gorda, half in jest, thatsecretly I would have given anything to be crazy. That would have absolved somepart of me from the crushing responsibility of revamping my understanding of theworld.The irony of it was that I could not have been more willing to revamp myunderstanding of the world, on an intellectual level, that is; but that was notenough. That had never been enough.And that had been my insurmountable obstacle all along; my deadly flaw. I hadbeen willing to dally in don Juan's world in a semi-convinced fashion:Therefore, I had been a quasi-sorcerer. All my efforts had been no more than myinane [* inane- devoid of intelligence] eagerness to fence with the intellect,as if I were in academia where one can do that very thing from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00p.m., at which time, duly tired, one goes home.Don Juan used to say as a joke that, after arranging the world in a mostbeautiful and enlightened manner, the scholar goes home at five o'clock in orderto forget his beautiful arrangement.While la Gorda made us some food I worked feverishly on my notes. I felt muchmore relaxed after eating. La Gorda was in the best of spirits. She clowned, theway don Genaro used to, imitating the gestures I made while I wrote.\"What do you know about the allies, Gorda?\" I asked.\"Only what the Nagual told me,\" she replied. \"He said that the allies wereforces that a sorcerer learns to control. He had two inside his gourd and so didGenaro.\"\"How did they keep them inside their gourds?\"\"No one knows that. All the Nagual knew was that a tiny, perfect gourd with aneck must be found before one could harness the allies.\"\"Where can one find that kind of gourd?\"\"Anywhere. The Nagual left word with me in case we survived the attack of theallies that we should start looking for the perfect gourd which must be the sizeof the thumb of the left hand. That was the size of the Nagual's gourd.\"\"Have you seen his gourd?\"\"No. Never. The Nagual said that a gourd of that kind is not in the world ofmen. It's like a little bundle that one can distinguish hanging from theirbelts. But if you deliberately look at it you will see nothing.\"The gourd, once it is found, must be groomed with great care. Usually sorcerersfind gourds like that on vines in the woods. They pick them and dry them andthen they hollow them out; and then they smooth them and polish them.\"Once the sorcerer has his gourd he must offer it to the allies and entice themto live there. If the allies consent, the gourd disappears from the world of menand the allies become an aid to the sorcerer. The Nagual and Genaro could maketheir allies do anything that needed to be done; things they themselves couldnot do. Such as, for instance, sending the wind to chase me or sending thatchicken to run inside Lidia's blouse.\"I heard a peculiar, prolonged hissing sound outside the door. It was the exactsound I had heard in dona Soledad's house two days before. This time I knew itwas the jaguar. The sound did not scare me. In fact, I would have stepped out tosee the jaguar had la Gorda not stopped me.\"You're still incomplete,\" she said. \"The allies would feast on you if you goout by yourself. Especially that daring one that's prowling out there now.\"\"My body feels very safe,\" I protested.She patted my back and held me down against the bench on which I was writing.\"You're not a complete sorcerer yet,\" she said. \"You have a huge patch in yourmiddle and the force of those allies would yank it out of place. They are nojoke.\"\"What are you supposed to do when an ally comes to you in this fashion?\"\"I don't bother with them one way or another. The Nagual taught me to bebalanced and not to seek anything eagerly. Tonight, for instance, I knew whichallies would go to you if you can ever get a gourd and groom it. You may beeager to get them. I'm not. Chances are I'll never get them myself. They are apain in the neck.\"\"Why?\"\"Because they are forces and as such they can drain you to nothing. The Nagualsaid that one is better off with nothing except one's purpose and freedom.Someday when you're complete perhaps we'll have to choose whether or not to keepthem.\"I told her that I personally liked the jaguar even though there was somethingoverbearing about it. She peered at me. There was a look of surprise andbewilderment in her eyes.\"I really like that one,\" I said.\"Tell me what you saw,\" she said.I realized at that moment that I had automatically assumed that she had seen thesame things I had. I described in great detail the four allies as I had seenthem. She listened more than attentively. She appeared to be spellbound by mydescription.\"The allies have no form,\" she said when I had finished. \"They are like apresence, like a wind, like a glow. The first one we found tonight was ablackness that wanted to get inside my body. That's why I screamed. I felt itreaching up my legs. The others were just colors. Their glow was so strong,though, that it made the trail look as if it were daytime.\"Her statements astounded me. I had finally accepted- after years of struggle andpurely on the basis of our encounter with them that night- that the allies had aconsensual form; a substance which could be perceived equally by everyone'ssenses.I jokingly told la Gorda that I had already written in my notes that they werecreatures with form.\"What am I going to do now?\" I asked in a rhetorical sense.\"It's very simple,\" she said. \"Write that they are not.\"I thought that she was absolutely right.\"Why do I see them as monsters?\" I asked.\"That's no mystery,\" she said. \"You haven't 'lost your human form' yet. The samething happened to me. I used to see the allies as people. All of them wereIndian men with horrible faces and mean looks. They used to wait for me indeserted places. I thought they were after me as a woman.\"The Nagual used to laugh his head off at my fears. But still I was half deadwith fright. One of them used to come and sit on my bed, and shake it until Iwould wake up. The fright that that ally used to give me was something that Idon't want repeated even now that I'm changed. Tonight I think I was as afraidof the allies as I used to be.\"\"You mean that you don't see them as human beings anymore?\"\"No. Not anymore. The Nagual told you that an ally is formless. He is right. Anally is only a presence; a helper that is nothing and yet it is as real as youand me.\"\"Have the little sisters seen the allies?\"\"Everybody has seen them one time or another.\"\"Are the allies just a force for them too?\"\"No. They are like you; they haven't lost their human form yet. None of themhas. For all of them- the little sisters, the Genaros and Soledad- the alliesare horrendous things. With them the allies are malevolent dreadful creatures ofthe night.\"The sole mention of the allies sends Lidia and Josefina and Pablito into afrenzy. Rosa and Nestor are not that afraid of them, but they don't want to haveanything to do with them either. Benigno has his own designs so he's notconcerned with them. They don't bother him, or me, for that matter. But theothers are easy prey for the allies; especially now that the allies are out ofthe Nagual's and Genaro's gourds. They come all the time looking for you.\"The Nagual told me that as long as one clings to the human form, one can onlyreflect that form; and since the allies feed directly onto our life-force in themiddle of the stomach, they usually make us sick, and then we see them as heavy,ugly creatures.\"\"Is there something that we can do to protect ourselves, or to change the shapeof those creatures?\"\"What all of you have to do is lose your human forms.\"\"What do you mean?\"My question did not seem to have any meaning for her. She stared at me blanklyas if waiting for me to clarify what I had just said. She closed her eyes for amoment.\"You don't know about the 'human mold' and the 'human form', do you?\" she asked.I stared at her.\"I've just seen that you know nothing about them,\" she said and smiled.\"You are absolutely right,\" I said.\"The Nagual told me that the human form is a force,\" she said. \"And the humanmold is... well... a mold. He said that everything has a particular mold. Plantshave molds, animals have molds, worms have molds. Are you sure the Nagual nevershowed you the human mold?\"I told her that he had sketched the concept, but in a very brief manner, oncewhen he had tried to explain something about a dream I had had. In the dream inquestion I had seen a man who seemed to be concealing himself in the darkness ofa narrow gully.To find him there scared me. I looked at him for a moment and then the manstepped forward and made himself visible to me. He was naked and his bodyglowed. He seemed to be delicate; almost frail. I liked his eyes. They werefriendly and profound. I thought that they were very kind. But then he steppedback into the darkness of the gully and his eyes became like two mirrors, likethe eyes of a ferocious animal.Don Juan said that I had encountered the human mold in 'dreaming'. He explainedthat sorcerers have the avenue of their dreaming to lead them to the mold, andthat the mold of men was definitely an entity; an entity which could be seen bysome of us at certain times when we are imbued with power; and by all of us, forsure, at the moment of our death. He described the mold as being the source- theorigin of man, since, without the mold to group together the force of life,there was no way for that force to assemble itself into the shape of man.He interpreted my dream as a brief and extraordinarily simplistic glance at themold. He said that my dream had restated the fact that I was a simple-minded andvery earthy man.La Gorda laughed and said that she would have said the same thing herself. Tosee the mold as an average naked man, and then as an animal had been indeed avery simplistic view of the mold.\"Perhaps it was just a stupid, ordinary dream,\" I said, trying to defend myself.\"No,\" she said with a large grin. \"You see, the human mold glows and it isalways found in water holes and narrow gullies.\"\"Why in gullies and water holes?\" I asked.\"It feeds on water. Without water there is no mold,\" she replied. \"I know thatthe Nagual took you to water holes regularly in hopes of showing yon the mold.But your emptiness prevented you from seeing anything. The same thing happenedto me. He used to make me lie naked on a rock in the very center of a particulardried-up water hole, but all I did was to feel the presence of something thatscared me out of my wits.\"\"Why does emptiness prevent one from seeing the mold?\"\"The Nagual said that everything in the world is a force; a pull or a push. Inorder for us to be pushed or pulled we need to be like a sail; like a kite inthe wind. But if we have a hole in the middle of our luminosity, the force goesthrough it and never acts upon us.\"The Nagual told me that Genaro liked you very much, and tried to make you awareof the hole in your middle. He used to fly his sombrero as a kite to tease you.He even pulled you from that hole until you had diarrhea, but you never caughton to what he was doing.\"\"Why didn't they tell me as plainly as you have told me?\"\"They did, but you didn't notice their words.\"I found her statement impossible to believe. To accept that they had told meabout it and I had not acknowledged it was unthinkable.\"Did you ever see the mold, Gorda?\" I asked.\"Sure, when I became complete again. I went to that particular water hole oneday by myself and there it was. It was a radiant luminous being. I could notlook at it. It blinded me.\"But being in its presence was enough. I felt happy and strong; and nothing elsemattered, nothing. Just being there was all I wanted. The Nagual said thatsometimes if we have enough personal power we can catch a glimpse of the moldeven though we are not sorcerers. When that happens, we say that we have seenGod. He said that if we call it God it is the truth. The mold is God.\"I had a dreadful time understanding the Nagual, because I was a very religiouswoman. I had nothing else in the world but my religion. So to hear the Nagualsay the things he used to say made me shiver. But then I became complete and theforces of the world began to pull me, and I knew that the Nagual was right. Themold is God. What do you think?\"\"The day I see it I'll tell you, Gorda,\" I said.She laughed, and said that the Nagual used to make fun of me, saying that theday I would see the mold I would probably become a Franciscan friar, because inthe depths of me I was a religious soul.\"Was the mold you saw a man or a woman?\" I asked.\"Neither. It was simply a luminous human. The Nagual said that I could haveasked something for myself. That a warrior cannot let that chance pass. But Icould not think of anything to ask for. It was better that way. I have the mostbeautiful memory of it. The Nagual said that a warrior with enough power can seethe mold many, many times. What a great fortune that must be!\"\"But if the human mold is what puts us together, what is the human form?\"\"Something sticky, a sticky force that makes us the people we are. The Nagualtold me that the human form has no form. Like the allies that he carried in hisgourd, it's anything; but in spite of not having form, it possesses us duringour lives and doesn't leave us until we die. I've never seen the human form butI have felt it in my body.\"She then described a very complex series of sensations that she had had over aperiod of years that culminated in a serious illness; the climax of which was abodily state that reminded me of descriptions I had read of a massive heartattack. She said that the human form, as the force that it is, left her bodyafter a serious internal battle that manifested itself as illness.\"It sounds as if you had a heart attack,\" I said.\"Maybe I did,\" she replied, \"but one thing I know for sure. The day I had it, Ilost my human form. I became so weak that for days I couldn't even get out of mybed. Since that day I haven't had the energy to be my old self. From time totime I have tried to get into my old habits, but I didn't have the strength toenjoy them the way I used to. Finally I gave up trying.\"\"What is the point of losing your form?\"\"A warrior must drop the human form in order to change- to really change.Otherwise, there is only talk about change, like in your case.\"The Nagual said that it is useless to think or hope that one can change one'shabits. One cannot change one iota as long as one holds on to the human form.The Nagual told me that a warrior knows that he cannot change, and yet he makesit his business to try to change even though he knows that he won't be able to.That's the only advantage a warrior has over the average man. The warrior isnever disappointed when he fails to change.\"\"But you are still yourself, Gorda, aren't you?\"\"No. Not anymore. The only thing that makes you think you are yourself is theform. Once it leaves, you are nothing.\"\"But you still talk and think and feel as you always did, don't you?\"\"Not at all. I'm new.\"She laughed and hugged me as if she were consoling a child.\"Only Eligio and I have lost our form,\" she went on. \"It was our great fortunethat we lost it while the Nagual was among us. You people will have a horridtime. That is your fate. Whoever loses it next will have only me as a companion.I already feel sorry for whoever it will be.\"\"What else did you feel, Gorda, when you lost your form, besides not havingenough energy?\"\"The Nagual told me that a warrior without form begins to see an eye. I saw aneye in front of me every time I closed my eyes. It got so bad that I couldn'trest anymore. The eye followed me wherever I went. I nearly went mad. Finally, Isuppose, I became used to it. Now I don't even notice it because it has becomepart of me.\"The formless warrior uses that eye to start dreaming. If you don't have a form,you don't have to go to sleep to do dreaming. The eye in front of you pulls youevery time you want to go.\"\"Where exactly is that eye, Gorda?\"She closed her eyes and moved her hand from side to side, right in front of hereyes, covering the span of her face.\"Sometimes the eye is very small and other times it is enormous,\" she went on.\"When it's small your dreaming is precise. If it's big your dreaming is likeflying over the mountains and not really seeing much. I haven't done enoughdreaming yet, but the Nagual told me that that eye is my trump card. One daywhen I become truly formless I won't see the eye anymore; the eye will becomejust like me, nothing, and yet it'll be there like the allies.\"The Nagual said that everything has to be sifted through our human form. Whenwe have no form, then nothing has form and yet everything is present. I couldn'tunderstand what he meant by that, but now I see that he was absolutely right.\"The allies are only a presence and so will be the eye. But at this time thateye is everything to me. In fact, in having that eye I should need nothing elsein order to call up my dreaming, even when I'm awake. I haven't been able to dothat yet. Perhaps I'm like you, a bit stubborn and lazy.\"\"How did you do the flying you showed me tonight?\"\"The Nagual taught me how to use my body to make lights because we are lightanyway. So I make sparks and lights, and they in turn lure the lines of theworld. Once I see one, it's easy to hook myself to it.\"\"How do you hook yourself?\"\"I grab it.\"She made a gesture with her hands. She clawed them and then placed them togetherjoined at the wrists, forming a sort of bowl with the clawed fingers upright.\"You have to grab the line like a jaguar,\" she went on, \"and never separate thewrists. If you do, you'll fall down and break your neck.\"She paused and that forced me to look at her; waiting for more of herrevelations.\"You don't believe me, do you?\" she asked.Without giving me time to answer, she squatted and began again to produce herdisplay of sparks. I was calm and collected, and could place my undividedattention on her actions. When she snapped her fingers open, every fiber of hermuscles seemed to tense at once. That tension seemed to be focused on the verytips of her fingers and was projected out like rays of light. The moisture inher fingertips was actually a vehicle to carry some sort of energy emanatingfrom her body.\"How did you do that, Gorda?\" I asked, truly marveling at her.\"I really don't know,\" she said. \"I simply do it. I've done it lots and lots oftimes and yet I don't know how I do it. When I grab one of those rays I feelthat I'm being pulled by something. I really don't do anything else except letthe lines I've grabbed pull me.\"When I want to get back through, I feel that the line doesn't want to let mefree and I get frantic. The Nagual said that that was my worst feature. I get sofrightened that one of these days I'm going to injure my body. But I figure thatone of these days I'll be even more formless and then I won't get frightened. Soas long as I hold on until that day, I'm all right.\"\"Tell me then, Gorda, how do you let the lines pull you?\"\"We're back again in the same spot. I don't know. The Nagual warned me aboutyou. You want to know things that cannot be known.\"I struggled to make clear to her that what I was after were the procedures. Ihad really given up looking for an explanation from all of them because theirexplanations explained nothing to me. To describe to me the steps that werefollowed was something altogether different.\"How did you learn to let your body hold onto the lines of the world?\" I asked.\"I learned that in dreaming,\" she said, \"but I really don't know how. Everythingfor a woman warrior starts in dreaming. The Nagual told me, just as he told you,first to look for my hands in my dreams. I couldn't find them at all. In mydreams I had no hands. I tried and tried for years to find them. Every night Iused to give myself the command to find my hands but it was to no avail. I neverfound anything in my dreams. The Nagual was merciless with me. He said that Ihad to find them or perish.\"So I lied to him that I had found my hands in my dreams. The Nagual didn't saya word but Genaro threw his hat on the floor and danced on it. He patted my headand said that I was really a great warrior. The more he praised me the worse Ifelt. I was about to tell the Nagual the truth when crazy Genaro aimed hisbehind at me and let out the loudest and longest fart I had ever heard. Heactually pushed me backward with it. It was like a hot, foul wind, disgustingand smelly, just like me. The Nagual was choking with laughter.\"I ran to the house and hid there. I was very fat then. I used to eat a greatdeal and I had a lot of gas. So I decided not to eat for a while. Lidia andJosefina helped me. I didn't eat anything for twenty-three days, and then onenight I found my hands in my dreams. They were old and ugly and green, but theywere mine. So that was the beginning. The rest was easy.\"\"And what was the rest, Gorda?\"\"The next thing the Nagual wanted me to do was to try to find houses orbuildings in my dreams and look at them, trying not to dissolve the images. Hesaid that the art of the dreamer is to hold the image of his dream. Becausethat's what we do anyway during all our lives.\"\"What did he mean by that?\"\"Our art as ordinary people is that we know how to hold the image of what we arelooking at. The Nagual said that we do that but we don't know how. We just doit- that is, our bodies do it. In dreaming we have to do the same thing, exceptthat in dreaming we have to learn how to do it. We have to struggle not to look,but merely to glance and yet hold the image.\"The Nagual told me to find in my dreams a brace for my belly button. It took along time because I didn't understand what he meant. He said that in dreaming wepay attention with the belly button; therefore it has to be protected. We need alittle warmth or a feeling that something is pressing the belly button in orderto hold the images in our dreams.\"I found a pebble in my dreams that fit my belly button, and the Nagual made melook for it day after day in water holes and canyons, until I found it. I made abelt for it and I still wear it day and night. Wearing it made it easier for meto hold images in my dreams.\"Then the Nagual gave me the task of going to specific places in my dreaming. Iwas doing really well with my task, but at that time I lost my form and I beganto see the eye in front of me.\"The Nagual said that the eye had changed everything, and he gave me orders tobegin using the eye to pull myself away. He said that I didn't have time to getto my double in dreaming, but that the eye was even better. I felt cheated. NowI don't care.\"I've used that eye the best way I could. I let it pull me in my dreaming. Iclose my eyes and fall asleep like nothing; even in the daytime or anywhere. Theeye pulls me and I enter into another world. Most of the time I just wanderaround in it.\"The Nagual told me and the little sisters that during our menstrual periodsdreaming becomes power. I get a little crazy for one thing. I become moredaring.\"And like the Nagual showed us, a crack opens in front of us during those days.You're not a woman so it can't make any sense to you; but two days before herperiod, a woman can open that crack and step through it into another world.\"With her left hand she followed the contour of an invisible line that seemed torun vertically in front of her at arm's length.\"During that time a woman, if she wants to, can let go of the images of theworld,\" la Gorda went on. \"That's the crack between the worlds, and as theNagual said, it is right in front of all of us women.\"The reason the Nagual believes women are better sorcerers than men is becausethey always have the crack in front of them, while a man has to make it.\"Well, it was during my periods that I learned in dreaming to fly with the linesof the world. I learned to make sparks with my body to entice the lines and thenI learned to grab them. And that's all I have learned in dreaming so far.\"I laughed and told her that I had nothing to show for my years of \"dreaming.\"\"You've learned how to call the allies in dreaming,\" she said with greatassurance.I told her that don Juan had taught me to make those sounds. She did not seem tobelieve me.\"The allies must come to you, then, because they're seeking his luminosity,\" shesaid, \"the luminosity he left with you. He told me that every sorcerer has onlyso much luminosity to give away. So he parcels it out to all his children inaccordance with an order that comes to him from somewhere out there in thatvastness. In your case he even gave you his own call.\"She clicked her tongue and winked at me.\"If you don't believe me,\" she went on, \"why don't you make the sound the Nagualtaught you and see if the allies come to you?\"I felt reluctant to do it. Not because I believed that my sound would bringanything, but because I did not want to humor her.She waited for a moment, and when she was sure I was not going to try, she puther hand to her mouth and imitated my tapping sound to perfection. She played itfor five or six minutes, stopping only to breathe.\"See what I mean?\" she asked smiling. \"The allies don't give a fig about mycalling, no matter how close it is to yours. Now try it yourself.\"I tried. After a few seconds I heard the call being answered. La Gorda jumped toher feet. I had the clear impression that she was more surprised than I was. Shehurriedly made me stop, turned off the lantern and gathered up my notes.She was about to open the front door, but she stopped short. A most frighteningsound came from just outside the door. It sounded to me like a growl. It was sohorrendous and ominous that it made us both jump back, away from the door. Myphysical alarm was so intense that I would have fled if I had had a place to go.Something heavy was leaning against the door. It made the door creak. I lookedat la Gorda. She seemed to be even more alarmed. She was still standing with herarm outstretched as if to open the door. Her mouth was open. She seemed to havebeen frozen in midaction.The door was about to be sprung open any moment. There were no bangs on it, justa terrifying pressure, not only on the door but all around the house.La Gorda stood up and told me to embrace her quickly from behind locking myhands around her waist over her belly button. She performed then a strangemovement with her hands.It was as though she were flipping a towel while holding it at the level of hereyes. She did it four times.Then she made another strange movement. She placed her hands at the middle ofher chest with the palms up, one above the other without touching. Her elbowswere straight out to her sides. She clasped her hands as if she had suddenlygrabbed two unseen bars. She slowly turned her hands over until the palms werefacing down and then she made a most beautiful, exertive movement, a movementthat seemed to engage every muscle in her body. It was as though she wereopening a heavy sliding door that offered a great resistance. Her body shiveredwith the exertion. Her arms moved slowly, as if opening a very, very heavy door,until they were fully extended laterally.I had the clear impression that as soon as she opened that door a wind rushedthrough. That wind pulled us and we actually went through the wall- or rather,the walls of the house went through us- or perhaps, all three of la Gorda, thehouse and myself went through the door she had opened.All of a sudden I was out in an open field. I could see the dark shapes of thesurrounding mountains and trees. I was no longer holding onto la Gorda's waist.A noise above me made me look up, and I saw her hovering perhaps ten feet aboveme like the black shape of a giant kite. I felt a terrible itch in my bellybutton and then la Gorda plummeted down to the ground at top speed, but insteadof crashing she came to a soft, total halt.At the moment that la Gorda landed, the itch in my umbilical region turned intoa horribly exhausting nervous pain. It was as if her landing were pulling myinsides out. I screamed in pain at the top of my voice.Then la Gorda was standing next to me, desperately out of breath. I was sittingdown. We were again in the room of don Genaro's house where we had been.La Gorda seemed unable to catch her breath. She was drenched in perspiration.\"We've got to get out of here,\" she muttered. It was a short drive to the little sisters' house. None of them was around. LaGorda lit a lantern and led me directly to the open-air kitchen in back. Thereshe undressed herself, and asked me to bathe her like a horse by throwing wateron her body. I took a small tub full of water and proceeded to pour it gently onher, but she wanted me to drench her.She explained that a contact with the allies, like the one we had, produced amost injurious perspiration that had to be washed off immediately. She made metake off my clothes and then drenched me in ice-cold water.Then she handed me a clean piece of cloth and we dried ourselves as we walkedback into the house. She sat on the big bed in the front room after hanging thelantern on the wall above it. Her knees were up and I could see every part ofher body. I hugged her naked body, and it was then that I realized what donaSoledad had meant when she said that la Gorda was the Nagual's woman. She wasformless like don Juan. I could not possibly think of her as a woman.I started to put on my clothes. She took them away from me. She said that beforeI could wear them again I had to sun them. She gave me a blanket to put over myshoulders and got another one for herself.\"That attack of the allies was truly scary,\" she said as we sat down on the bed.\"We were really lucky that we could get out of their grip. I had no idea why theNagual told me to go to Genaro's with you. Now I know. That house is where theallies are the strongest. They missed us by the skin of our teeth. We were luckythat I knew how to get out.\"\"How did you do it, Gorda?\"\"I really don't know,\" she said. \"I simply did it. My body knew how, I suppose,but when I want to think how I did it, I can't.\"This was a great test for both of us. Until tonight I didn't know that I couldopen the eye, but look what I did. I actually opened the eye just as the Nagualsaid I could.\"I've never been able to do it until you came along. I've tried but it neverworked. This time the fear of those allies made me just grab the eye the way theNagual told me to, by shaking it four times in its four directions. He said thatI should shake it as I shake a bed sheet, and then I should open it as a door,by holding it right at the middle. The rest was very easy. Once the door wasopened I felt a strong wind pulling me instead of blowing me away.\"The trouble, the Nagual said, is to return. You have to be very strong to dothat. The Nagual and Genaro and Eligio could go in and out of that eye likenothing. For them the eye was not even an eye. They said it was an orange light,like the sun. And so were the Nagual and Genaro an orange light when they flew.\"I'm still very low on the scale. The Nagual said that when I do my flying, Ispread out and look like a pile of cow dung in the sky. I have no light. That'swhy the return is so dreadful for me. Tonight you helped me and pulled me backtwice.\"The reason I showed you my flying tonight was because the Nagual gave me ordersto let you see it no matter how difficult or crummy it is. With my flying I wassupposed to be helping you, the same way you were supposed to be helping me whenyou showed me your double.\"I saw your whole maneuver from the door. You were so busy feeling sorry forJosefina that your body didn't notice my presence. I saw how your double cameout from the top of your head. It wriggled out like a worm. I saw a shiver thatbegan in your feet and went through your body and then your double came out. Itwas like you, but very shiny. It was like the Nagual himself. That's why thesisters were petrified. I knew they thought that it was the Nagual himself. ButI couldn't see all of it. I missed the sound because I have no attention forit.\"\"I beg your pardon?\"\"The double needs a tremendous amount of attention. The Nagual gave thatattention to you, but not to me. He told me that he had run out of time.\"She said something else about a certain kind of attention but I was very tired.I fell asleep so suddenly that I did not even have time to put my notes away. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"4. The Genaros I woke up around eight the next morning and found that la Gorda had sunned myclothes and made breakfast. We ate in the kitchen in the dining area. When wehad finished, I asked her about Lidia, Rosa and Josefina. They seemed to havevanished from the house.\"They are helping Soledad,\" she said. \"She's getting ready to leave.\"\"Where is she going?\"\"Somewhere away from here. She has no more reason to stay. She was waiting foryou and you have already come.\"\"Are the little sisters going with her?\"\"No. They just don't want to be here today. It looks as if today is not a goodday for them to stick around.\"\"Why isn't it a good day?\"\"The Genaros are coming to see you today and the girls don't get along withthem. If all of them are here together, they'll get into a most dreadful fight.The last time that happened they nearly killed one another.\"\"Do they fight physically?\"\"You bet they do. All of them are very strong and none of them wants to takesecond place. The Nagual told me that that would happen, but I am powerless tostop them; and not only that, but I have to take sides. So it's a mess.\"\"How do you know that the Genaros are coming today?\"\"I haven't talked to them. I just know that they will be here today, that'sall.\"\"Do you know that because you see, Gorda?\"\"That's right. I see them coming. And one of them is coming directly to youbecause you're pulling him.\"I assured her that I was not pulling anyone in particular. I said that I had notrevealed to anyone the purpose of my trip, but that it had to do with somethingI had to ask Pablito and Nestor.She smiled coyly, and said that fate had paired me with Pablito; that we werevery alike, and that undoubtedly he was going to see me first. She added thateverything that happened to a warrior could be interpreted as an omen. Thus myencounter with Soledad was an omen of what I was going to find out on my visit.I asked her to explain her point.\"The men will give you very little this time,\" she said. \"It's the women whowill rip you to shreds, as Soledad did. That's what I would say if I read theomen. You're waiting for the Genaros, but they are men like you.\"And look at this other omen: They are a little bit behind. I would say a coupleof days behind. That's your fate as well as theirs, as men, to be always acouple of days behind.\"\"Behind what, Gorda?\"\"Behind everything. Behind us women, for instance.\"She laughed and patted my head.\"No matter how stubborn you are,\" she went on, \"you have to admit that I'mright. Wait and see.\"\"Did the Nagual tell you that men are behind women?\" I asked.\"Sure he did,\" she replied. \"All you have to do is look around.\"\"I do, Gorda. But I don't see any such thing. Women are always behind. They aredependent on men.\"She laughed. Her laughter was not scornful or bitter. It was rather a clearsound of joyfulness.\"You know the world of people better than I do,\" she said forcefully. \"But rightnow I'm formless and you're not. I'm telling you, women are better sorcerersbecause there is a crack in front of our eyes, and there is none in front ofyours.\"She did not seem angry, but I felt obliged to explain that I asked questions andmade comments not because I was attacking or defending any given point, butbecause I wanted her to talk.She said that she had done nothing else but talk since the moment we met, andthat the Nagual had trained her to talk because her task was the same as mine;to be in the world of people.\"Everything we say,\" she went on, \"is a reflection of the world of people. Youwill find out before your visit is over that you talk and act the way you dobecause you're clinging to the human form; just as the Genaros and the littlesisters are clinging to the human form when they fight to kill one another.\"\"But aren't all of you supposed to cooperate with Pablito, Nestor and Benigno?\"\"Genaro and the Nagual told every one of us that we should live in harmony andhelp and protect one another because we are alone in the world.\"Pablito was left in charge of us four, but he's a coward. If it were left up tohim, he would let us die like dogs. When the Nagual was around, though, Pablitowas very nice to us and took very good care of us. Everyone used to tease himand joke that he took care of us as if we were his wives. The Nagual and Genarotold him, not too long before they left, that he had a real chance to become theNagual someday, because we might become his four winds, his four corners.Pablito understood it to be his task and from that day on he changed. He becameinsufferable. He began to order us around as if we were really his wives.\"I asked the Nagual about Pablito's chances and he told me that I should knowthat everything in a warrior's world depends on personal power and personalpower depends on impeccability. If Pablito were impeccable he would have achance.\"I laughed when he told me that. I know Pablito very well. But the Nagualexplained to me that I shouldn't take it so lightly. He said that warriorsalways have a chance, no matter how slim. He made me see that I was a warriormyself, and that I shouldn't hinder Pablito with my thoughts. He said that Ishould turn them off and let Pablito be; that the impeccable thing for me to dowas to help Pablito in spite of what I knew about him.\"I understood what the Nagual said. Besides, I have my own debt with Pablito andI welcomed the opportunity to help him. But I also knew that no matter how Ihelped him, he was going to fail. I knew all along that he didn't have what ittakes to be like the Nagual. Pablito is very childish and he won't accept hisdefeat. He's miserable because he's not impeccable, and yet he's still trying inhis thoughts to be like the Nagual.\"\"How did he fail?\"\"As soon as the Nagual left, Pablito had a deadly run-in with Lidia. Years agothe Nagual had given him the task of being Lidia's husband; just forappearances. The people around here thought that she was his wife. Lidia didn'tlike that one bit. She's very tough.\"The truth of the matter is that Pablito has always been scared to death of her.They could never get along together and they tolerated each other only becausethe Nagual was around; but when he left, Pablito got crazier than he already wasand became convinced that he had enough personal power to take us as his wives.\"The three Genaros got together and discussed what Pablito should do and decidedthat he should take the toughest woman first; Lidia. They waited until she wasalone and then all three of them came into the house and grabbed her by the armsand threw her on the bed. Pablito got on top of her.\"She thought at first that the Genaros were joking, but when she realized thatthey were serious, she hit Pablito with her head in the middle of his foreheadand nearly killed him. The Genaros fled and Nestor had to tend to Pablito'swound for months.\"\"Is there something that I can do to help them understand?\"\"No. Unfortunately understanding is not their problem. All six of themunderstand very well. The real trouble is something else; something very uglythat no one can help them with. They indulge in not trying to change. Since theyknow they won't succeed in changing no matter how much they try, or want to, orneed to, they have given up trying altogether.\"That's as wrong as feeling disappointed with our failures. The Nagual told eachof them that warriors, both men and women, must be impeccable in their effort tochange in order to scare the human form and shake it away. After years ofimpeccability a moment will come, the Nagual said, when the form cannot stand itany longer and it leaves, just as it left me. In doing so, of course, it injuresthe body and can even make it die, but an impeccable warrior survives, always.\"A sudden knock at the front door interrupted her. La Gorda stood up and wentover to unlatch the door. It was Lidia. She greeted me very formally and askedla Gorda to go with her. They left together.I welcomed being alone. I worked on my notes for hours. The open-air dining areawas cool and had very good light.La Gorda returned around noon. She asked me if I wanted to eat. I was nothungry, but she insisted that I eat. She said that contacts with the allies werevery debilitating, and that she felt very weak herself.After eating I sat down with la Gorda and was getting ready to ask her about'dreaming' when the front door opened loudly and Pablito walked in. He waspanting. He obviously had been running, and appeared to be in a state of greatexcitation. He stood at the door for a moment, catching his breath.He hadn't changed much. He seemed a bit older, or heavier, or perhaps only moremuscular. He was, however, still very lean and wiry. His complexion was pale, asif he had not been in the sun for a long time. The brownness of his eyes wasaccentuated by a faint mark of weariness in his face. I remembered Pablito ashaving a beguiling smile. As he stood there looking at me, his smile was ascharming as ever.He ran over to where I was sitting and grasped my forearms for a moment, withoutsaying a word. I stood up. He then shook me gently and embraced me. I myself wasutterly delighted to see him. I was jumping up and down with an infantile joy. Idid not know what to say to him. He finally broke the silence.\"Maestro,\" he said softly, nodding his head slightly as if he were bowing to me.The title of \"maestro,\" teacher, caught me by surprise. I turned around as if Iwere looking for someone else who was just behind me. I deliberately exaggeratedmy movements to let him know that I was mystified. He smiled, and the only thingthat occurred to me was to ask him how he knew I was there.He said that he, Nestor, and Benigno had been forced to return because of a mostunusual apprehension which made them run day and night without any pause. Nestorhad gone to their own house to find out if there was something there that wouldaccount for the feeling that had driven them. Benigno had gone to Soledad'splace, and he himself had come to the girls' house.\"You hit the jackpot, Pablito,\" la Gorda said, and laughed.Pablito did not answer. He glared at her.\"I'll bet that you're working yourself up to throw me out,\" he said in a tone ofgreat anger.\"Don't fight with me, Pablito,\" la Gorda said, unruffled.Pablito turned to me and apologized, and then added in a very loud voice, as ifhe wanted someone else in the house to hear him, that he had brought his ownchair to sit on and that he could put it wherever he pleased.\"There's no one else around here except us,\" la Gorda said softly, and chuckled.\"I'll bring in my chair anyway,\" Pablito said. \"You don't mind, Maestro, doyou?\"I looked at la Gorda. She gave me an almost imperceptible go-ahead sign with thetip of her foot.\"Bring it in. Bring anything you want,\" I said.Pablito stepped out of the house.\"They're all that way,\" la Gorda said, \"all three of them.\"Pablito came back a moment later carrying an unusual looking chair on hisshoulders. The chair was shaped to follow the contour of his back, so when hehad it on his shoulders, upside down, it looked like a backpack.\"May I put it down?\" he asked me.\"Of course,\" I replied, moving the bench over to make room.He laughed with exaggerated ease.\"Aren't you the Nagual?\" he asked me, and then looked at la Gorda and added, \"Ordo you have to wait for orders?\"\"I am the Nagual,\" I said facetiously in order to humor him.I sensed that he was about to pick a fight with la Gorda. She must have sensedit too, for she excused herself and went out the back.Pablito put his chair down and slowly circled around me as if he were inspectingmy body. Then he took his low-back narrow chair in one hand, turned it aroundand sat down, resting his folded arms on the back of the chair that was made toallow him the maximum comfort as he sat astride it. I sat down facing him. Hismood had changed completely the instant la Gorda left.\"I must ask you to forgive me for acting the way I did,\" he said smiling, \"but Ihad to get rid of that witch.\"\"Is she that bad, Pablito?\"\"You can bet on that,\" he replied.To change the subject I told him that he looked very fine and prosperous.\"You look very fine yourself, Maestro,\" he said.\"What's this nonsense of calling me Maestro?\" I asked in a joking tone.\"Things are not the same as before,\" he replied. \"We are in a new realm, and theWitness says that you're a maestro now; and the Witness cannot be wrong.\"But he will tell you the whole story himself. He'll be here shortly, and willhe be glad to see you again. I think that by now he must have felt that you arehere. As we were coming back, all of us had the feeling that you might be onyour way, but none of us felt that you had already arrived.\"I told him then that I had come for the sole purpose of seeing him and Nestor;that they were the only two people in the world with whom I could talk about ourlast meeting with don Juan and don Genaro, and that I needed more than anythingelse to clear up the uncertainties that that last meeting had created in me.\"We're bound to one another,\" he said. \"I'll do anything I can to help. You knowthat. But I must warn you that I'm not as strong as you would want me to be.Perhaps it would be better if we didn't talk at all. But, on the other hand, ifwe don't talk we'll never understand anything.\"In a careful and deliberate manner I formulated my query. I explained that therewas one single issue at the crux of my rational predicament.\"Tell me, Pablito,\" I said, \"did we truly jump with our bodies into the abyss?\"\"I don't know,\" he said. \"I really don't know.\"\"But you were there with me.\"\"That's the point. Was I really there?\"I felt annoyed at his cryptic replies. I had the sensation that if I would shakehim or squeeze him, something in him would be set free. It was apparent to methat he was deliberately withholding something of great value. I protested thathe would choose to be secretive with me when we had a bond of total trust.Pablito shook his head as if silently objecting to my accusation.I asked him to recount to me his whole experience starting from the time priorto our jump when don Juan and don Genaro had prepared us together for the finalonslaught.Pablito's account was muddled and inconsistent. All he could remember about thelast moments before we jumped into the abyss was that after don Juan and donGenaro had said good-bye to both of us and had disappeared into the darkness,his strength waned. He was about to fall on his face, but I held him by his armand carried him to the edge of the abyss; and there he blacked out.\"What happened after you blacked out, Pablito?\"\"I don't know.\"\"Did you have dreams or visions? What did you see?\"\"As far as I'm concerned I had no visions, or if I did I couldn't pay anyattention to them. My lack of impeccability makes it impossible for me toremember them.\"\"And then what happened?\"\"I woke up at Genaro's old place. I don't know how I got there.\"He remained quiet while I frantically searched in my mind for a question, acomment, a critical statement, or anything that would add extra breadth to hisstatements. As it was, nothing in Pablito's account was usable to buttress whathad happened to me. I felt cheated. I was almost angry with him. My feelingswere a mixture of pity for Pablito and myself, and at the same time a mostintense disappointment.\"I'm sorry I'm such a letdown to you,\" Pablito said.My immediate reaction to his words was to cover up my feelings and assure himthat I was not disappointed at all.\"I am a sorcerer,\" he said, laughing, \"a poor one, but enough of a one to knowwhat my body tells me. And right now it tells me that you are angry with me.\"\"I'm not angry, Pablito!\" I exclaimed.\"That's what your reason says, but not your body,\" he said. \"Your body is angry.Your 'reason', however, finds no reason to feel anger toward me, so you'recaught in a cross fire. The least I can do for you is to untangle this. Yourbody is angry because it knows that I am not impeccable and that only animpeccable warrior can help you. Your body is angry because it feels that I amwasting myself. It knew all that the minute I walked through that door.\"I did not know what to say. I felt a flood of post-fact realizations. Perhaps hewas right in saying that my body knew all that. At any rate, his directness inconfronting me with my feelings had blunted the edge of my frustration. I beganto wonder if Pablito was not just playing a game with me. I told him that beingso direct and bold he could not possibly be as weak as he pictured himself tobe.\"My weakness is that I'm made to have longings,\" he said almost in a whisper.\"I'm even to the point where I long for my life as an ordinary man. Can youbelieve that?\"\"You can't be serious, Pablito! \" I exclaimed.\"I am,\" he replied. \"I long for the grand privilege of walking the face of theearth as an ordinary man without this awesome burden.\"I found his stand simply preposterous and caught myself exclaiming over and overthat he could not possibly be serious. Pablito looked at me and sighed. I wasovertaken by a sudden apprehension. He seemed to be on the verge of tears. Myapprehension gave way to an intense feeling of empathy. Neither of us could helpeach other.La Gorda came back to the kitchen at that moment. Pablito seemed to experiencean instantaneous revitalization. He jumped to his feet and stomped on the floor.\"What the hell do you want?\" he yelled in a shrill, nervous voice. \"Why are yousnooping around?\"La Gorda addressed me as if he did not exist. She politely said that she wasgoing to Soledad's house.\"What the hell do we care where you go?\" he yelled. \"You can go to hell for thatmatter.\"He stomped on the floor like a spoiled child while la Gorda stood therelaughing.\"Let's get out of this house. Maestro,\" he said loudly.His sudden shift from sadness to anger fascinated me. I became engrossed inwatching him. One of the features that I had always admired was his nimbleness.Even when he stomped his feet, his movements had grace.He suddenly reached across the table and nearly snatched my writing pad awayfrom me. He grabbed it with the thumb and index finger of his left hand. I hadto hold onto it with both hands, using all my strength. There was such anextraordinary force in his pull that if he had really wanted to take it he couldhave easily jerked it away from my grip.He let go, and as he retrieved his hand I saw a fleeting image of an extensionto it. It happened so fast that I could have explained it as a visual distortionon my part; a product of the jolt of having to stand up halfway drawn by theforce of his pull. But I had learned by then that I could neither behave withthose people in my accustomed manner, nor could I explain anything in myaccustomed manner; so I did not even try.\"What's that in your hand, Pablito?\" I asked.He recoiled in surprise and hid his hand behind his back. He had a blankexpression and mumbled that he wanted us to leave that house because he wasbecoming dizzy.La Gorda began to laugh loudly and said that Pablito was as good a deceiver asJosefina, maybe even better, and that if I pressed him to tell me what was inhis hand he would faint and Nestor would have to tend to him for months.Pablito began to choke. His face became almost purple. La Gorda told him in anonchalant tone to cut out the acting because he had no audience: She wasleaving and I did not have much patience. She then turned to me, and told me ina most commanding tone to stay there and not go to the Genaros' house.\"Why in the hell not?\" Pablito yelled and jumped in front of her as if trying tostop her from leaving. \"What gall! Telling the Maestro what to do!\"\"We had a bout with the allies in your house last night,\" la Gorda said toPablito matter-of-factly. \"The Nagual and I are still weak from that. If I wereyou, Pablito, I would put my attention to work. Things have changed. Everythinghas changed since he came.\"La Gorda left through the front door. I became aware then that indeed she lookedvery tired. Her shoes seemed too tight, or perhaps she was so weak that her feetdragged a little bit. She seemed small and frail.I thought that I must have looked as tired. Since there were no mirrors in theirhouse, I had the urge to go outside and look at myself in the side mirror of mycar. I perhaps would have done it but Pablito thwarted me. He asked me in themost earnest tone not to believe a word of what she had said about his being adeceiver. I told him not to worry about that.\"You don't like la Gorda at all, do you?\" I asked.\"You can say that again,\" he replied with a fierce look. \"You know better thananyone alive the kind of monsters those women are. The Nagual told us that oneday you were going to come here just to fall into their trap.\"He begged us to be on the alert and warn you about their designs. The Nagualsaid that you had one out of four chances: If our power was high, we could bringyou here ourselves and warn you and save you; if our power was low we ourselveswould arrive here just in time to see your corpse; the third chance was to findyou either the slave to the witch Soledad or the slave of those disgustingmannish women; the fourth chance, and the faintest one of all was to find youalive and well.\"The Nagual told us that in case you survived, you would then be the Nagual andwe should trust you because only you could help us.\"\"I'll do anything for you, Pablito. You know that.\"\"Not just for me. I'm not alone. The Witness and Benigno are with me. We aretogether and you have to help all of us.\"\"Of course, Pablito. That goes without saying.\"\"People around here have never bothered us. Our problems are with those uglymannish freaks. We don't know what to do with them. The Nagual gave us orders tostay around them no matter what. He gave me a personal task but I've failed atit. I was very happy before. You remember. Now I can't seem to manage my lifeanymore.\"\"What happened, Pablito?\"\"Those witches drove me from my house. They took over and pushed me out liketrash. I now live in Genaro's house with Nestor and Benigno. We even have tocook our own meals.\"The Nagual knew that this might happen and gave la Gorda the task of mediatingbetween us and those three bitches. But la Gorda is still what the Nagual usedto call her, 'Two Hundred and Twenty Buttocks'. That was her nickname for yearsand years because she tipped the scales at two hundred and twenty pounds.\"Pablito chuckled at his recollection of la Gorda.\"She was the fattest, smelliest slob you'd ever want to see,\" he went on. \"Todayshe's half her real size, but she's still the same fat slow woman up there inher head; and she can't do a thing for us. But you're here now, Maestro, and ourworries are over. Now we are four against four.\"I wanted to interject a comment but he stopped me.\"Let me finish what I have to say before that witch comes back to throw me out,\"he said as he nervously looked at the door.\"I know that they have told you that the five of you are the same because youare the Nagual's children. That's a lie! You're also like us, the Genaros,because Genaro also helped to make your luminosity. You're one of us too. Seewhat I mean? So, don't you believe what they tell you. You also belong to us.\"The witches don't know that the Nagual told us everything. They think that theyare the only ones who know. It took two Toltecs to make us. We are the childrenof both. Those witches...\"\"Wait, wait, Pablito,\" I said, putting my hand over his mouth.He stood up, apparently frightened by my sudden movement.\"What do you mean that it took two Toltecs to make us?\"\"The Nagual told us that we are Toltecs. All of us are Toltecs. He said that aToltec is the receiver and holder of mysteries. The Nagual and Genaro areToltecs. They gave us their special luminosity and their mysteries. We receivedtheir mysteries and now we hold them.\"His usage of the word Toltec baffled me. I was familiar only with itsanthropological meaning. In that context, it always refers to a culture ofNahuatl-speaking people in central and southern Mexico which was already extinctat the time of the Conquest.\"Why did he call us Toltecs?\" I asked, not knowing what else to say.\"Because that's what we are. Instead of saying that we are sorcerers or witches,he said that we are Toltecs.\"\"If that's the case, why do you call the little sisters witches?\"\"Oh, that's because I hate them. That has nothing to do with what we are.\"\"Did the Nagual tell that to everyone?\"\"Why, certainly. Everyone knows.\"\"But he never told me that.\"\"Oh, that's because you are a very educated man and are always discussing stupidthings.\"He laughed in a forced, high-pitched tone and patted me on the back.\"Did the Nagual by any chance tell you that the Toltecs were ancient people thatlived in this part of Mexico?\" I asked.\"See, there you go. That's why he didn't tell you. The old crow probably didn'tknow that they were ancient people.\"He rocked in his chair as he laughed. His laughter was very pleasing and verycontagious.\"We are the Toltecs, Maestro,\" he said. \"Rest assured that we are. That's all Iknow. But you can ask the Witness. He knows. I lost my interest a long timeago.\"He stood up and went over to the stove. I followed him. He examined a pot offood cooking on a low fire. He asked me if I knew who had made that food. I waspretty sure that la Gorda had made it, but I said that I did not know. Hesniffed it four or five times in short inhalations, like a dog.Then he announced that his nose told him that la Gorda had cooked it. He askedme if I had had some, and when I said that I had finished eating just before hearrived, he took a bowl from a shelf and helped himself to an enormous portion.He recommended in very strong terms that I should eat food cooked only by laGorda and that I should only use her bowl, as he himself was doing.I told him that la Gorda and the little sisters had served me my food in a darkbowl that they kept on a shelf apart from the others. He said that that bowlbelonged to the Nagual.We went back to the table. He ate very slowly and did not talk at all. His totalabsorption in eating made me realize that all of them did the same thing: theyate in complete silence.\"La Gorda is a great cook,\" he said as he finished his food. \"She used to feedme. That was ages ago before she hated me; before she became a witch- I mean aToltec.\"He looked at me with a glint in his eye and winked.I felt obligated to comment that la Gorda did not strike me as being capable ofhating anyone. I asked him if he knew that she had lost her form.\"That's a lot of baloney!\" he exclaimed.He stared at me as if measuring my look of surprise, and then hid his face underhis arm and giggled like an embarrassed child.\"Well, she actually did do that,\" he added. \"She's just great.\"\"Why do you dislike her, then?\"\"I'm going to tell you something, Maestro, because I trust you. I don't dislikeher at all. She's the very best. She's the Nagual's woman. I just act that waywith her because I like her to pamper me, and she does. She never gets mad atme. I could do anything.\"Sometimes I get carried away and I get physical with her and want to strikeher. When that happens she just jumps out of the way, like the Nagual used todo. The next minute she doesn't even remember what I did. That's a true formlesswarrior for you. She does the same thing with everyone. But the rest of us are asorry mess. We are truly bad. Those three witches hate us and we hate themback.\"\"You are sorcerers, Pablito; can't you stop all this bickering?\"\"Sure we can, but we don't want to. What do you expect us to do; be likebrothers and sisters?\"I did not know what to say.\"They were the Nagual's women,\" he went on. \"And yet everybody expected me totake them. How in heaven's name am I going to do that! I tried with one of themand instead of helping me the bastardly witch nearly killed me. So now every oneof those women is after my hide as if I had committed a crime. All I did was tofollow the Nagual's instructions. He told me that I had to be intimate with eachof them, one by one, until I could hold all of them at once. But I couldn't beintimate with even one.\"I wanted to ask him about his mother, dona Soledad, but I could not figure out away to bring her into the conversation at that point. We were quiet for amoment.\"Do you hate them for what they tried to do to you?\" he asked all of a sudden.I saw my chance.\"No, not at all,\" I said. \"La Gorda explained to me their reasons. But donaSoledad's attack was very scary. Do you see much of her?\"He did not answer. He looked at the ceiling. I repeated my question. I noticedthen that his eyes were filled with tears. His body shook, convulsed by quietsobs.He said that once he had had a beautiful mother, whom, no doubt, I could stillremember. Her name was Manuelita, a saintly woman who raised two children,working like a mule to support them. He felt the most profound veneration forthat mother who had loved and reared him.But one horrible day his fate was fulfilled and he had the misfortune to meetGenaro and the Nagual, and between the two of them they destroyed his life. In avery emotional tone Pablito said that the two devils took his soul and hismother's soul. They killed his Manuelita and left behind that horrendous witch,Soledad. He peered at me with eyes flooded with tears and said that that hideouswoman was not his mother. She could not possibly be his Manuelita.He sobbed uncontrollably. I did not know what to say. His emotional outburst wasso genuine and his contentions so truthful that I felt swayed by a tide ofsentiment. Thinking as an average civilized man I had to agree with him. Itcertainly looked as if it was a great misfortune for Pablito to have crossed thepath of don Juan and don Genaro.I put my arm around his shoulders and almost wept myself. After a long silencehe stood up and went out to the back. I heard him blowing his nose and washinghis face in a pail of water. When he returned he was calmer. He was evensmiling.\"Don't get me wrong, Maestro,\" he said. \"I don't blame anyone for what hashappened to me. It was my fate. Genaro and the Nagual acted like the impeccablewarriors they were. I'm just weak, that's all. And I have failed in my task. TheNagual said that my only chance to avoid the attack of that horrendous witch wasto corral the four winds, and make them into my four corners. But I failed.Those women were in cahoots with that witch Soledad and didn't want to help me.They wanted me dead.\"The Nagual also told me that if I failed, you wouldn't stand a chance yourself.He said that if she killed you, I had to flee and run for my life. He doubtedthat I could even get as far as the road. He said that with your power and withwhat the witch already knows, she would have been peerless. So, when I felt Ihad failed to corral the four winds, I considered myself dead. And of course Ihated those women. But today, Maestro, you bring me new hope.\"I told him that his feelings for his mother had touched me very deeply. I was infact appalled by all that had happened but I doubted intensely that I hadbrought hope of any kind to him.\"You have!\" he exclaimed with great certainty. \"I've felt terrible all thistime. To have your own mother coming after you with an axe is nothing anyone canfeel happy about. But now she's out of the way, thanks to you and whatever youdid.\"Those women hate me because they're convinced I'm a coward. They just can't getit through their thick heads that we are different. You and those four women aredifferent than me and the Witness and Benigno in one important way.\"All five of you were pretty much dead before the Nagual found you. He told usthat once you had even tried to kill yourself. We were not that way. We werewell and alive and happy. We are the opposite of you. You are desperate people.We are not. If Genaro hadn't come my way, I would be a happy carpenter today. Orperhaps I would have died. It doesn't matter. I would've done what I could andthat would have been fine.\"His words plunged me into a curious mood. I had to admit that he was right inthat those women and myself were indeed desperate people. If I had not met donJuan, I would no doubt be dead, but I could not say, as Pablito had, that itwould have been fine with me either way. Don Juan had brought life and vigor tomy body and freedom to my spirit.Pablito's statements made me remember something don Juan had told me once whenwe were talking about an old man, a friend of mine. Don Juan had said in veryemphatic terms that the old man's life or death had no significance whatsoever.I felt a bit cross at what I thought to be redundance on don Juan's part. I toldhim that it went without saying that the life and death of that old man had nosignificance, since nothing in the world could possibly have any significanceexcept to each one of us personally.\"You said it!\" he exclaimed, and laughed. \"That's exactly what I mean. That oldman's life and death have no significance to him personally. He could have diedin nineteen twenty-nine, or in nineteen fifty, or he could live until nineteenninety-five. It doesn't matter. Everything is stupidly the same to him.\"My life before I met don Juan had been that way. Nothing had ever mattered tome. I used to act as if certain things affected me, but that was only acalculated ploy to appear as a sensitive man.Pablito spoke to me and disrupted my reflections. He wanted to know if he hadhurt my feelings. I assured him that it was nothing. In order to start up theconversation again, I asked him where he had met don Genaro.\"My fate was that my boss got ill,\" he said. \"And I had to go to the city marketin his place to build a new section of clothing booths. I worked there for twomonths. While I was there I met the daughter of the owner of one of the booths.We fell in love. I built her father's stand a little bigger than the others so Icould make love to her under the counter while her sister took care of thecustomers.\"One day Genaro brought a sack of medicinal plants to a retailer across theaisle, and while they were talking he noticed that the clothing stand wasshaking. He looked carefully at the stand but he only saw the sister sitting ona chair half asleep. The man told Genaro that every day the stand shook likethat around that hour.\"The next day Genaro brought the Nagual to watch the stand shaking, and sureenough that day it shook. They came back the next day and it shook again. Sothey waited there until I came out.\"That day I made their acquaintance, and soon after Genaro told me that he wasan herbalist and proposed to make me a potion that no woman could resist. Iliked women so I fell for it. He certainly made the potion for me, but it tookhim ten years. In the meantime I got to know him very well, and I grew to lovehim more than if he were my own brother. And now I miss him like hell. So yousee, he tricked me. Sometimes I'm glad that he did. Most of the time I resent itthough.\"\"Don Juan told me that sorcerers have to have an omen before they choosesomeone. Was there something of that sort with you, Pablito?\"\"Yes. Genaro said that he got curious watching the stand shaking and then he sawthat two people were making love under the counter. So he sat down to wait forthe people to come out. He wanted to see who they were. After a while the girlappeared in the stand but he missed me. He thought it was very strange that hewould miss me after being so determined to set eyes on me.\"The next day he came back with the Nagual. He also saw that two people weremaking love, but when it was time to catch me, they both missed me. They cameback again the next day. Genaro went around to the back of the stand while theNagual stayed out in front. I bumped into Genaro while I was crawling out. Ithought he hadn't seen me because I was still behind the piece of cloth thatcovered a small square opening I had made on the side wall. I began to bark tomake him think there was a small dog under the drape. He growled and barked backat me, and really made me believe that there was a huge mad dog on the otherside.\"I got so scared I ran out the other way and crashed into the Nagual. If hewould have been an ordinary man, I would have thrown him to the ground because Iran right into him, but instead he lifted me up like a child. I was absolutelyflabbergasted. For being such an old man he was truly strong. I thought I coulduse a strong man like that to carry lumber for me. Besides I didn't want to loseface with the people who had seen me running out from under the counter.\"I asked him if he would like to work for me. He said yes. That same day he wentto the shop and started to work as my assistant. He worked there every day fortwo months. I didn't have a chance with those two devils.\"The incongruous image of don Juan working for Pablito was extremely humorous tome. Pablito began to imitate the way don Juan carried lumber on his shoulders. Ihad to agree with la Gorda that Pablito was as good an actor as Josefina.\"Why did they go to all that trouble, Pablito?\"\"They had to trick me. You don't think that I would go with them just like that,do you? I've heard all my life about sorcerers and curers and witches andspirits; and I never believed a word of it.\"Those who talked about things like that were just ignorant people. If Genarohad told me that he and his friend were sorcerers, I would've walked out onthem. But they were too clever for me. Those two foxes were really sly. Theywere in no hurry. Genaro said that he would've waited for me if it took himtwenty years. That's why the Nagual went to work for me. I asked him to, so itwas really me who gave them the key.\"The Nagual was a diligent worker. I was a little bit of a rascal in those daysand I thought I was the one playing a trick on him. I believed that the Nagualwas just a stupid old Indian so I told him that I was going to tell the bossthat he was my grandpa, otherwise they wouldn't hire him, but I had to get apercentage of his salary. The Nagual said that it was fine with him. He gave mesomething out of the few pesos he made each day.\"My boss was very impressed with my grandpa because he was such a hard worker.But the other guys made fun of him. As you know, he had the habit of crackingall his joints from time to time. In the shop he cracked them every time hecarried anything. People naturally thought that he was so old that when hecarried something on his back his whole body creaked.\"I was pretty miserable with the Nagual as my grandpa. But by then Genaro hadalready prevailed on my greedy side. He had told me that he was feeding theNagual a special formula made out of plants and that it made him strong as abull.\"Every day Genaro used to bring a small bundle of mashed up green leaves andfeed it to him. Genaro said that his friend was nothing without his concoction,and to prove it to me he didn't give it to him for two days. Without the greenstuff the Nagual seemed to be just a plain ordinary old man.\"Genaro told me that I could also use his concoction to make women love me. Igot very interested in it and he said that we could be partners if I would helphim prepare his formula, and give it to his friend. One day he showed me someAmerican money and told me he had sold his first batch to an American. Thathooked me and I became his partner.\"My partner Genaro and I had great designs. He said that I should have my ownshop because with the money that we were going to make with his formula I couldafford anything. I bought a shop and my partner paid for it. So I went wild. Iknew that my partner was for real and I began to work making his green stuff.\"I had the strange conviction at that point that don Genaro must have usedpsychotropic plants in making his concoction. I reasoned that he must havetricked Pablito into ingesting it in order to assure his compliance.\"Did he give you power plants, Pablito?\" I asked.\"Sure,\" he replied. \"He gave me his green stuff. I ate tons of it.\"He described and imitated how don Juan would sit by the front door of donGenaro's house in a state of profound lethargy and then spring to life as soonas his lips touched the concoction. Pablito said that in view of such atransformation he was forced to try it himself.\"What was in that formula?\" I asked.\"Green leaves,\" he replied. \"Any green leaves he could get a hold of. That wasthe kind of devil Genaro was. He used to talk about his formula and make melaugh until I was as high as a kite. God, I really loved those days.\"I laughed out of nervousness. Pablito shook his head from side to side andcleared his throat two or three times. He seemed to be struggling not to weep.\"As I've already said. Maestro,\" he went on, \"I was driven by greed. I secretlyplanned to dump my partner once I had learned how to make the green stuffmyself. Genaro must have always known the designs I had in those days, and justbefore he left, he hugged me and told me that it was time to fulfill my wish. Itwas time to dump my partner because I had already learned to make the greenstuff.\"Pablito stood up. His eyes were filled with tears.\"That son of a gun Genaro,\" he said softly. \"That rotten devil. I truly lovedhim, and if I weren't the coward I am, I would be making his green stuff today.\"I didn't want to write anymore. To dispel my sadness I told Pablito that weshould go look for Nestor.I was arranging my notebooks in order to leave when the front door was flungopen with a loud bang. Pablito and I jumped up involuntarily and quickly turnedto look. Nestor was standing at the door. I ran to him. We met in the middle ofthe front room. He sort of leaped on me and shook me by the shoulders.He looked taller and stronger than the last time I had seen him. His long leanbody had acquired an almost feline smoothness. Somehow, the person facing me,peering at me, was not the Nestor I had known. I remembered him as a very shyman who was embarrassed to smile because of crooked teeth; a man who wasentrusted to Pablito for his care.The Nestor who was looking at me was a mixture of don Juan and don Genaro. Hewas wiry and agile like don Genaro, but had the mesmeric command that don Juanhad. I wanted to indulge in being perplexed, but all I could do was laugh withhim. He patted me on the back. He took off his hat. Only then did I realize thatPablito did not have one. I also noticed that Nestor was much darker, and morerugged. Next to him Pablito looked almost frail. Both of them wore AmericanLevi's, heavy jackets and crepe soled shoes.Nestor's presence in the house lightened up the oppressive mood instantly. Iasked him to join us in the kitchen.\"You came right in time,\" Pablito said to Nestor with an enormous smile as wesat down. \"The Maestro and I were weeping here; remembering the Toltec devils.\"\"Were yon really crying. Maestro?\" Nestor asked with a malicious grin on hisface.\"You bet he was,\" Pablito replied.A very soft cracking noise at the front door made Pablito and Nestor stoptalking. If I had been by myself, I would not have noticed or heard anything.Pablito and Nestor stood up. I did the same. We looked at the front door. It wasbeing opened in a most careful manner. I thought that perhaps la Gorda hadreturned and was quietly opening the door so as not to disturb us.When the door was finally opened wide enough to allow one person to go through,Benigno came in as if he were sneaking into a dark room. His eyes were shut andhe was walking on the tips of his toes. He reminded me of a kid sneaking into amovie theater through an unlocked exit door in order to see a matinee; notdaring to make any noise and at the same time not capable of seeing a thing inthe dark.Everybody was quietly looking at Benigno. He opened one eye just enough to peekout of it and orient himself and then he tiptoed across the front room to thekitchen. He stood by the table for a moment with his eyes closed. Pablito andNestor sat down, and signaled me to do the same. Benigno then slid next to me onthe bench. He gently shoved my shoulder with his head. It was a light tap inorder for me to move over to make room for him on the bench. Then he sat downcomfortably with his eyes still closed.He was dressed in Levi's like Pablito and Nestor. His face had filled out a bitsince the last time I had seen him, years before, and his hairline wasdifferent, but I could not tell how. He had a lighter complexion than Iremembered, very small teeth, full lips, high cheekbones, a small nose and bigears. He had always seemed to me like a child whose features had not matured.Pablito and Nestor, who had interrupted what they were saying to watch Benigno'sentrance, resumed talking as soon as he sat down as though nothing had happened.\"Sure, he was crying with me,\" Pablito said.\"He's not a crybaby like you,\" Nestor said to Pablito.Then Nestor turned to me and embraced me.\"I'm so glad you're alive,\" he said. \"We've just talked to la Gorda and she saidthat you were the Nagual, but she didn't tell us how you survived. How did yousurvive, Maestro?\"At that point I had a strange choice. I could have followed my rational path, asI had always done, and said that I did not have the vaguest idea, and I wouldhave been truthful at that.Or I could have said that my double had extricated me from the grip of thosewomen. I was measuring in my mind the possible effect of each alternative when Iwas distracted by Benigno. He opened one eye a little bit and looked at me andthen giggled and buried his head in his arms.\"Benigno, don't you want to talk to me?\" I asked.He shook his head negatively.I felt self-conscious with him next to me and decided to ask what was the matterwith him.\"What's he doing?\" I asked Nestor in a low voice.Nestor rubbed Benigno's head and shook him. Benigno opened his eyes and thenclosed them again.\"He's that way, you know,\" Nestor said to me. \"He's extremely shy. He'll openhis eyes sooner or later. Don't pay any attention to him. If he gets bored he'llgo to sleep.\"Benigno shook his head affirmatively without opening his eyes.\"Well, how did you get out?\" Nestor insisted.\"Don't you want to tell us?\" Pablito asked.I deliberately said that my double had come out from the top of my head threetimes. I gave them an account of what had happened.They did not seem in the least surprised and took my account as a matter ofcourse. Pablito became delighted with his own speculations that dona Soledadmight not recover and might eventually die. He wanted to know if I had struckLidia as well. Nestor made an imperative gesture for him to be quiet and Pablitomeekly stopped in the middle of a sentence.\"I'm sorry. Maestro,\" Nestor said, \"but that was not your double.\"\"But everyone said that it was my double.\"\"I know for a fact that you misunderstood la Gorda because as Benigno and I werewalking to Genaro's house, la Gorda overtook us on the road and told us that youand Pablito were here in this house. She called you the Nagual. Do you knowwhy?\"I laughed and said that I believed it was due to her notion that I had gottenmost of the Nagual's luminosity.\"One of us here is a fool!\" Benigno said in a booming voice without opening hiseyes.The sound of his voice was so outlandish that I jumped away from him. Histhoroughly unexpected statement, plus my reaction to it, made all of them laugh.Benigno opened one eye and looked at me for an instant and then buried his facein his arms.\"Do you know why we called Juan Matus the Nagual?\" Nestor asked me.I said that I had always thought that that was their nice way of calling donJuan a sorcerer.Benigno laughed so loudly that the sound of his laughter drowned out everybodyelse's. He seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. He rested his head on myshoulder as if it were a heavy object he could no longer support.\"The reason we called him the Nagual,\" Nestor went on, \"is because he was splitin two. In other words, any time he needed to, he could get into another trackthat we don't have ourselves. Something would come out of him; something thatwas not a double, but a horrendous, menacing shape that looked like him but wastwice his size. We call that shape the nagual and anybody who has it is, ofcourse, the Nagual.\"The Nagual told us that all of us can have that shape coming out of our headsif we wanted to, but chances are that none of us would want to. Genaro didn'twant it, so I think we don't want it, either. So it appears that you're the onewho's stuck with it.\"They cackled and yelled as if they were corraling a herd of cattle. Benigno puthis arms around my shoulders without opening his eyes and laughed until tearswere rolling down his cheeks.\"Why do you say that I am stuck with it?\" I asked Nestor.\"It takes too much energy,\" he said, \"too much work. I don't know how you canstill be standing.\"The Nagual and Genaro split you once in the eucalyptus grove. They took youthere because eucalyptuses are your trees. I was there myself and I witnessedwhen they split you and pulled your nagual out. They pulled you apart by theears until they had split your luminosity and you were not an egg anymore, buttwo long chunks of luminosity. Then they put you together again, but anysorcerer that sees can tell that there is a huge gap in the middle.\"\"What's the advantage of being split?\"\"You have one ear that hears everything and one eye that sees everything and youwill always be able to go an extra mile in a moment of need. That splitting isalso the reason why they told us that you are the Maestro.\"They tried to split Pablito but it looks like it failed. He's too pampered andhas always indulged like a bastard. That's why he's so screwed up now.\"\"What's a double then?\"\"A double is 'the other'; the body that one gets in dreaming. It looks exactlylike oneself.\"\"Do all of you have a double?\"Nestor scrutinized me with a look of surprise.\"Hey, Pablito, tell the Maestro about our doubles,\" he said laughing.Pablito reached across the table and shook Benigno.\"You tell him, Benigno,\" he said. \"Better yet, show it to him.\"Benigno stood up, opened his eyes as wide as he could and looked at the roof,then he pulled down his pants and showed me his penis.The Genaros went wild with laughter.\"Did you really mean it when you asked that, Maestro?\" Nestor asked me with anervous expression.I assured him that I was deadly serious in my desire to know anything related totheir knowledge. I went into a long elucidation of how don Juan had kept meoutside of their realm for reasons I could not fathom, thus preventing me fromknowing more about them.\"Think of this,\" I said. \"I didn't know until three days ago that those fourgirls were the Nagual's apprentices, or that Benigno was don Genaro'sapprentice.\"Benigno opened his eyes.\"Think of this yourself,\" he said. \"I didn't know until now that you were sostupid.\"He closed his eyes again and all of them laughed insanely. I had no choice butto join them.\"We were just teasing you. Maestro,\" Nestor said in way of an apology. \"Wethought that you were teasing us, rubbing it in. The Nagual told us that yousee. If you do, you can tell that we are a sorry lot. We don't have the body ofdreaming. None of us has a double.\"In a very serious and earnest manner Nestor said that something had come inbetween them and their desire to have a double. I understood him as saying thata sort of barrier had been created since don Juan and don Genaro had left. Hethought that it might be the result of Pablito flubbing his task. Pablito addedthat since the Nagual and Genaro had gone, something seemed to be chasing them,and even Benigno, who was living in the southernmost tip of Mexico at that time,had to return. Only when the three of them were together did they feel at ease.\"What do you think it is?\" I asked Nestor.\"There is something out there in that immensity that's pulling us,\" he replied.\"Pablito thinks it's his fault for antagonizing those women.\"Pablito turned to me. There was an intense glare in his eyes.\"They've put a curse on me, Maestro,\" he said. \"I know that the cause of all ourtrouble is me. I wanted to disappear from these parts after my fight with Lidia,and a few months later I took off for Veracruz.\"I was actually very happy there with a girl I wanted to marry. I got a job andwas doing fine until one day I came home and found that those four mannishfreaks, like beasts of prey, had tracked me down by my scent. They were in myhouse tormenting my woman. That bitch Rosa put her ugly hand on my woman's bellyand made her shit in the bed, just like that.\"Their leader, Two Hundred and Twenty Buttocks, told me that they had walkedacross the continent looking for me. She just grabbed me by the belt and pulledme out. They pushed me to the bus depot to bring me here. I got madder than thedevil but I was no match for Two Hundred and Twenty Buttocks. She put me on thebus.\"But on our way here I ran away. I ran through bushes and over hills until myfeet got so swollen that I couldn't get my shoes off. I nearly died. I was illfor nine months. If the Witness hadn't found me, I would have died.\"\"I didn't find him,\" Nestor said to me. \"La Gorda found him. She took me towhere he was and between the two of us we carried him to the bus and brought himhere. He was delirious and we had to pay an extra fare so that the bus driverwould let him stay on the bus.\"In a most dramatic tone Pablito said that he had not changed his mind. He stillwanted to die.\"But why?\" I asked him.Benigno answered for him in a booming, guttural voice.\"Because his pecker doesn't work,\" he said.The sound of his voice was so extraordinary that for an instant I had theimpression that he was talking inside a cavern. It was at once frightening andincongruous. I laughed almost out of control.Nestor said that Pablito had attempted to fulfill his task of establishingsexual relations with the women, in accordance with the Nagual's instructions.He had told Pablito that the four corners of his world were already set inposition and all he had to do was to claim them.But when Pablito went to claim his first corner, Lidia, she nearly killed him.Nestor added that it was his personal opinion as a witness of the event that thereason Lidia rammed him with her head was because Pablito could not perform as aman, and rather than being embarrassed by the whole thing, she hit him.\"Did Pablito really get sick as a result of that blow or was he pretending?\" Iasked half in jest.Benigno answered again in the same booming voice.\"He was just pretending!\" he said. \"All he got was a bump on the head! \"Pablito and Nestor cackled and yelled.\"We don't blame Pablito for being afraid of those women,\" Nestor said. \"They areall like the Nagual himself, fearsome warriors. They're mean and crazy.\"\"Do you really think they're that bad?\" I asked him.\"To say they're bad is only one part of the whole truth,\" Nestor said. \"They'rejust like the Nagual. They're serious and gloomy. When the Nagual was around,they used to sit close to him and stare into the distance with half-closed eyesfor hours, sometimes for days.\"\"Is it true that Josefina was really crazy a long time ago?\" I asked.\"That's a laugh,\" Pablito said. \"Not a long time ago. She's crazy now. She's themost insane of the bunch.\"I told them what she had done to me. I thought that they would appreciate thehumor of her magnificent performance. But my story seemed to affect them thewrong way. They listened to me like frightened children. Even Benigno opened hiseyes to listen to my account.\"Wow!\" Pablito exclaimed. \"Those bitches are really awful. And you know thattheir leader is Two Hundred and Twenty Buttocks. She's the one that throws therock and then hides her hand and pretends to be an innocent little girl. Becareful of her, Maestro.\"\"The Nagual trained Josefina to be anything,\" Nestor said. \"She can do anythingyou want: cry, laugh, get angry, anything.\"\"But what is she like when she is not acting?\" I asked Nestor.\"She's just crazier than a bat,\" Benigno answered in a soft voice. \"I metJosefina the first day she arrived. I had to carry her into the house. TheNagual and I used to tie her down to her bed all the time. Once she began to cryfor her friend, a little girl she used to play with. She cried for three days.Pablito consoled her and fed her like a baby.Then, referring to Pablito, Benigno added, \"She's like him. Both of them don'tknow how to stop once they begin.\"Benigno suddenly began to sniff the air. He stood up and went over to the stove.\"Is he really shy?\" I asked Nestor.\"He's shy and eccentric,\" Pablito answered. \"He'll be that way until he loseshis form. Genaro told us that we will lose our form sooner or later, so there isno point in making ourselves miserable in trying to change ourselves the way theNagual told us to. Genaro told us to enjoy ourselves and not worry aboutanything. You and the women worry and try. We on the other hand, enjoy. Youdon't know how to enjoy things and we don't know how to make ourselvesmiserable. The Nagual called making yourself miserable, impeccability. We callit stupidity, don't we?\"\"You are speaking for yourself, Pablito,\" Nestor said.\"Benigno and I don't feel that way.\"Benigno brought a bowl of food over and placed it in front of me. He servedeveryone. Pablito examined the bowls and asked Benigno where he had found them.Benigno said that they were in a box where la Gorda had told him she had storedthem. Pablito confided in me that those bowls used to belong to them beforetheir split.\"We have to be careful,\" Pablito said in a nervous tone. \"These bowls are nodoubt bewitched. Those bitches put something in them. I'd rather eat out of laGorda's bowl.\"Nestor and Benigno began to eat. I noticed then that Benigno had given me thebrown bowl. Pablito seemed to be in a great turmoil. I wanted to put him at easebut Nestor stopped me.\"Don't take him so seriously,\" he said. \"He loves to be that way. He'll sit downand eat. This is where you and the women fail. There is no way for you tounderstand that Pablito is like that. You expect everybody to be like theNagual. La Gorda is the only one who's unruffled by him, not because sheunderstands but because she has lost her form.\"Pablito sat down to eat and among the four of us we finished a whole pot offood. Benigno washed the bowls and carefully put them back in the box and thenall of us sat down comfortably around the table.Nestor proposed that as soon as it got dark we should all go for a walk in aravine nearby where don Juan, don Genaro and I used to go. I felt somehowreluctant. I did not feel confident enough in their company. Nestor said thatthey were used to walking in the darkness and that the art of a sorcerer was tobe inconspicuous even in the midst of people.I told him what don Juan had once said to me before he had left me in a desertedplace in the mountains not too far from there. He had demanded that Iconcentrate totally on trying not to be obvious. He said that the people of thearea knew everyone by sight.There were not very many people, but those who lived there walked around all thetime and could spot a stranger from miles away. He told me that many of thosepeople had firearms and would have thought nothing of shooting me.\"Don't be concerned with beings from the other world,\" don Juan had saidlaughing. \"The dangerous ones are the Mexicans.\"\"That's still valid,\" Nestor said. \"That has been valid all the time. That's whythe Nagual and Genaro were the artists they were. They learned to becomeunnoticeable in the middle of all this. They knew the art of stalking.\"It was still too early for our walk in the dark. I wanted to use the time to askNestor my critical question. I had been avoiding it all along. Some strangefeeling had prevented me from asking. It was as if I had exhausted my interestafter Pablito's reply. But Pablito himself came to my aid and all of a sudden hebrought up the subject as if he had been reading my mind.\"Nestor also jumped into the abyss the same day we did,\" he said. \"And in thatway he became the Witness, you became the Maestro and I became the villageidiot.\"In a casual manner I asked Nestor to tell me about his jump into the abyss. Itried to sound only mildly interested. But Pablito was aware of the true natureof my forced indifference. He laughed and told Nestor that I was being cautiousbecause I had been deeply disappointed with his own account of the event.\"I went over after you two did,\" Nestor said, and looked at me as if waiting foranother question.\"Did you jump immediately after us?\" I asked.\"No. It took me quite a while to get ready,\" he said. \"Genaro and the Nagualdidn't tell me what to do. That day was a test day for all of us.\"Pablito seemed despondent. He stood up from his chair and paced the room. He satdown again shaking his head in a gesture of despair.\"Did you actually see us going over the edge?\" I asked Nestor.\"I am the Witness,\" he said. \"To witness was my path of knowledge. To tell youimpeccably what I witness is my task.\"\"But what did you really see?\" I asked.\"I saw you two holding each other and running toward the edge,\" he said. \"Andthen I saw you both like two kites against the sky. Pablito moved farther out ina straight line and then fell down. You went up a little and then you moved awayfrom the edge a short distance, before falling down.\"\"But, did we jump with our bodies?\" I asked.\"Well, I don't think there was another way to do it,\" he said, and laughed.\"Could it have been an illusion?\" I asked.\"What are you trying to say. Maestro?\" he asked in a dry tone.\"I want to know what really happened,\" I said.\"Did you by any chance black out, like Pablito?\" Nestor asked with a glint inhis eye.I tried to explain to him the nature of my quandary about the jump. He could nothold still and interrupted me. Pablito intervened to bring him to order and theybecame involved in an argument. Pablito squeezed himself out of it by walkinghalf seated around the table, holding onto his chair.\"Nestor doesn't see beyond his nose,\" he said to me. \"Benigno is the same.You'll get nothing from them. At least you got my sympathy.\"Pablito cackled, making his shoulders shiver, and hid his face with Benigno'shat.\"As far as I'm concerned, you two jumped,\" Nestor said to me in a suddenoutburst. \"Genaro and the Nagual had left you with no other choice. That wastheir art; to corral you and then lead you to the only gate that was open. Andso you two went over the edge. That was what I witnessed. Pablito says that hedidn't feel a thing; that is questionable. I know that he was perfectly aware ofeverything, but he chooses to feel and say that he wasn't.\"\"I really wasn't aware,\" Pablito said to me in an apologetic tone.\"Perhaps,\" Nestor said dryly. \"But I was aware myself, and I saw your bodiesdoing what they had to do, jump.\"Nestor's assertions put me in a strange frame of mind. All along I had beenseeking validation for what I had perceived myself. But once I had it, Irealized that it made no difference.To know that I had jumped and to be afraid of what I had perceived was onething. To seek consensual validation was another. I knew then that one had nonecessary correlation with the other. I had thought all along that to havesomeone else corroborate that I had taken that plunge would absolve my intellectof its doubts and fears. I was wrong. I became instead more worried; moreinvolved with the issue.I began to tell Nestor that although I had come to see the two of them for thespecific purpose of having them confirm that I had jumped, I had changed my mindand I really did not want to talk about it anymore. Both of them started talkingat once, and at that point we fell into a three-way argument. Pablito maintainedthat he had not been aware, Nestor shouted that Pablito was indulging and I saidthat I didn't want to hear anything more about the jump.It was blatantly obvious to me for the first time that none of us had calmnessand self-control. None of us was willing to give the other person our undividedattention the way don Juan and don Genaro did.Since I was incapable of maintaining any order in our exchange of opinions, Iimmersed myself in my own deliberations. I had always thought that the only flawthat had prevented me from entering fully into don Juan's world was myinsistence on rationalizing everything, but the presence of Pablito and Nestorhad given me a new insight into myself. Another flaw of mine was my timidity.Once I strayed outside the safe railings of common sense, I could not trustmyself and became intimidated by the awesomeness of what unfolded in front ofme. Thus, I found it was impossible to believe that I had jumped into an abyss.Don Juan had insisted that the whole issue of sorcery was perception, andtruthful to that, he and don Genaro staged for our last meeting an immense,cathartic drama on the flat mountaintop.After they made me voice my thanks in loud clear words to everyone who had everhelped me, I became transfixed with elation. At that point they had caught allmy attention and led my body to perceive the only possible act within theirframe of references; the jump into the abyss. That jump was the practicalaccomplishment of my perception, not as an average man but as a sorcerer.I had been so absorbed in writing down my thoughts I had not noticed that Nestorand Pablito had stopped talking and all three of them were looking at me. Iexplained to them that there was no way for me to understand what had takenplace with that jump.\"There's nothing to understand,\" Nestor said. \"Things just happen and no one cantell how. Ask Benigno if he wants to understand.\"\"Do you want to understand?\" I asked Benigno as a joke.\"You bet I do!\" he exclaimed in a deep bass voice, making everyone laugh.\"You indulge in saying that you want to understand,\" Nestor went on. \"Just likePablito indulges in saying that he doesn't remember anything.\"He looked at Pablito, and winked at me. Pablito lowered his head.Nestor asked me if I had noticed something about Pablito's mood when we wereabout to take our plunge. I had to admit that I had been in no position tonotice anything so subtle as Pablito's mood.\"A warrior must notice everything,\" Nestor said. \"That's his trick, and as theNagual said, there lies his advantage.\"He smiled and made a deliberate gesture of embarrassment; hiding his face withhis hat.\"What was it that I missed about Pablito's mood?\" I asked him.\"Pablito had already jumped before he went over,\" he said. \"He didn't have to doanything. He may as well have sat down on the edge instead of jumping.\"\"What do you mean by that?\" I asked.\"Pablito was already disintegrating,\" he replied. \"That's why he thinks hepassed out. Pablito lies. He's hiding something.\"Pablito began to speak to me. He muttered some unintelligible words, then gaveup and slumped back in his chair. Nestor also started to say something. I madehim stop. I was not sure I had understood him correctly.\"Was Pablito's body distegrating?\" I asked.He peered at me for a long time without saying a word. He was sitting to myright. He moved quietly to the bench opposite me.\"You must take what I say seriously,\" he said. \"There is no way to turn back thewheel of time to what we were before that jump. The Nagual said that it is anhonor and a pleasure to be a warrior, and that it is the warrior's fortune to dowhat he has to do. I have to tell you impeccably what I have witnessed.\"Pablito was disintegrating. As you two ran toward the edge only you were solid.Pablito was like a cloud. He thinks that he was about to fall on his face, andyou think that you held him by the arm to help him make it to the edge. Neitherof you is correct, and I wouldn't doubt that it would have been better for bothof you if you hadn't picked Pablito up.\"I felt more confused than ever. I truly believed that he was sincere inreporting what he had perceived, but I remembered that I had only held Pablito'sarm.\"What would have happened if I hadn't interfered?\" I asked.\"I can't answer that,\" Nestor replied. \"But I know that you affected eachother's luminosity. At the moment you put your arm around him, Pablito becamemore solid, but you wasted your precious power for nothing.\"\"What did you do after we jumped?\" I asked Nestor after a long silence.\"Right after you two had disappeared,\" he said, \"my nerves were so shatteredthat I couldn't breathe and I too passed out. I don't know for how long. Ithought it was only for a moment. When I came to my senses again, I lookedaround for Genaro and Nagual. They were gone. I ran back and forth on the top ofthat mountain, calling them until my voice was hoarse.\"Then I knew I was alone. I walked to the edge of the cliff and tried to lookfor the sign that the earth gives when a warrior is not going to return, but Ihad already missed it. I knew then that Genaro and the Nagual were gone forever.I had not realized until then that they had turned to me after they had saidgood-bye to you two, and as you were running to the edge they waved their handsand said good-bye to me.\"Finding myself alone at that time of day, on that deserted spot, was more thanI could bear. In one sweep I had lost all the friends I had in the world. I satdown and wept. And as I got more and more scared I began to scream as loud as Icould. I called Genaro's name at the top of my voice. By then it waspitch-black. I could no longer distinguish any landmarks.\"I knew that as a warrior I had no business indulging in my grief. In order tocalm myself down I began to howl like a coyote, the way the Nagual had taughtme. After howling for a while I felt so much better that I forgot my sadness. Iforgot that the world existed. The more I howled the easier it was to feel thewarmth and protection of the earth.\"Hours must have passed. Suddenly I felt a blow inside of me, behind my throat,and the sound of a bell in my cars. I remembered what the Nagual had told Eligioand Benigno before they jumped. He said that the feeling in the throat came justbefore one was ready to change speed, and that the sound of the bell was thevehicle that one could use to accomplish anything that one needed.\"I wanted to be a coyote then. I looked at my arms, which were on the ground infront of me. They had changed shape and looked like a coyote's. I saw thecoyote's fur on my arms and chest. I was a coyote! That made me so happy that Icried like a coyote must cry. I felt my coyote teeth and my long and pointedmuzzle and tongue. Somehow, I knew that I had died, but I didn't care. It didn'tmatter to me to have turned into a coyote, or to be dead, or to be alive. Iwalked like a coyote, on four legs, to the edge of the precipice and leaped intoit. There was nothing else for me to do.\"I felt that I was falling down and my coyote body turned in the air. Then I wasmyself again twirling in midair. But before I hit the bottom I became so lightthat I didn't fall anymore but floated. The air went through me. I was so light!I believed that my death was finally coming inside me.\"Something stirred my insides and I disintegrated like dry sand. It was peacefuland perfect where I was. I somehow knew that I was there and yet I wasn't. I wasnothing. That's all I can say about it.\"Then, quite suddenly, the same thing that had made me like dry sand put metogether again. I came back to life and I found myself sitting in the hut of anold Mazatec sorcerer.\"He told me his name was Porfirio. He said that he was glad to see me and beganto teach me certain things about plants that Genaro hadn't taught me. He took mewith him to where the plants were being made and showed me the mold of plants,especially the marks on the molds. He said that if I watched for those marks inthe plants I could easily tell what they're good for, even if I had never seenthose plants before. Then when he knew that I had learned the marks he saidgood-bye but invited me to come see him again. At that moment I felt a strongpull and I disintegrated, like before. I became a million pieces.\"Then I was pulled again into myself and went back to see Porfirio. He had,after all, invited me. I knew that I could have gone anywhere I wanted but Ichose Porfirio's hut because he was kind to me and taught me. I didn't want torisk finding awful things instead.\"Porfirio took me this time to see the mold of the animals. There I saw my ownnagual animal. We knew each other on sight. Porfirio was delighted to see suchfriendship. I saw Pablito's and your own nagual too, but they didn't want totalk to me. They seemed sad. I didn't insist on talking to them. I didn't knowhow you had fared in your jump. I knew that I was dead myself, but my nagualsaid that I wasn't and that you both were also alive.\"I asked about Eligio, and my nagual said that he was gone forever. I rememberedthen that when I had witnessed Eligio's and Benigno's jump I had heard theNagual giving Benigno instructions not to seek bizarre visions or worlds outsidehis own.\"The Nagual told him to learn only about his own world, because in doing so hewould find the only form of power available to him. The Nagual gave themspecific instructions to let their pieces explode as far as they could in orderto restore their strength. I did the same myself. I went back and forth from thetonal to the nagual eleven times. Every time, however, I was received byPorfirio who instructed me further. Every time my strength waned I restored itin the nagual until a time when I restored it so much that I found myself backon this earth.\"\"Dona Soledad told me that Eligio didn't have to jump into the abyss,\" I said.\"He jumped with Benigno,\" Nestor said. \"Ask him, he'll tell you in his favoritevoice.\"I turned to Benigno and asked him about his jump.\"You bet we jumped together!\" he replied in a blasting voice. \"But I never talkabout it.\"\"What did Soledad say Eligio did?\" Nestor asked.I told them that dona Soledad had said that Eligio was twirled by a wind andleft the world while he was working in an open field.\"She's thoroughly confused,\" Nestor said. \"Eligio was twirled by the allies. Buthe didn't want any of them, so they let him go. That has nothing to do with thejump. La Gorda said that you had a bout with allies last night. I don't knowwhat you did, but if you had wanted to catch them or entice them to stay withyou, you had to spin with them.\"Sometimes they come of their own accord to the sorcerer and spin him. Eligiowas the best warrior there was so the allies came to him of their own accord. Ifany of us want the allies, we would have to beg them for years, and even if wedid, I doubt that the allies would consider helping us.\"Eligio had to jump like everybody else. I witnessed his jump. He was pairedwith Benigno. A lot of what happens to us as sorcerers depends on what yourpartner does. Benigno is a bit off his rocker because his partner didn't comeback. Isn't that so, Benigno?\"\"You bet it is!\" Benigno answered in his favorite voice.I succumbed at that point to a great curiosity that had plagued me from thefirst time I had heard Benigno speak. I asked him how he made his booming voice.He turned to face me. He sat up straight and pointed to his mouth as if hewanted me to look fixedly at it.\"I don't know!\" he boomed. \"I just open my mouth and this voice comes out of it!\"He contracted the muscles of his forehead, curled up his lips and made aprofound booing sound. I then saw that he had tremendous muscles in his temples,which had given his head a different contour. It was not his hairline that wasdifferent but the whole upper front part of his head.\"Genaro left him his noises,\" Nestor said to me. \"Wait until he farts.\"I had the feeling that Benigno was getting ready to demonstrate his abilities.\"Wait, wait, Benigno,\" I said, \"it's not necessary.\"\"Oh, shucks!\" Benigno exclaimed in a tone of disappointment. \"I had the best onejust for you.\"Pablito and Nestor laughed so hard that even Benigno lost his deadpan expressionand cackled with them.\"Tell me what else happened to Eligio,\" I asked Nestor after they had calmeddown again.\"After Eligio and Benigno jumped,\" Nestor replied, \"the Nagual made me lookquickly over the edge, in order to catch the sign the earth gives when warriorsjump into the abyss. If there is something like a little cloud, or a faint gustof wind, the warrior's time on earth is not over yet. The day Eligio and Benignojumped I felt one puff of air on the side Benigno had jumped and I knew that histime was not up. But Eligio's side was silent.\"\"What do you think happened to Eligio? Did he die?\"All three of them stared at me. They were quiet for a moment. Nestor scratchedhis temples with both hands. Benigno giggled and shook his head. I attempted toexplain but Nestor made a gesture with his hands to stop me.\"Are you serious when you ask us questions?\" he asked me.Benigno answered for me. When he was not clowning, his voice was deep andmelodious. He said that the Nagual and Genaro had set us up so all of us hadpieces of information that the others did not have.\"Well, if that's the case we'll tell you what's what,\" Nestor said, smiling asif a great load had been lifted off his shoulders. \"Eligio did not die. Not atall.\"\"Where is he now?\" I asked.They looked at one another again. They gave me the feeling that they werestruggling to keep from laughing. I told them that all I knew about Eligio waswhat dona Soledad had told me. She had said that Eligio had gone to the otherworld to join the Nagual and Genaro. To me that sounded as if the three of themhad died.\"Why do you talk like that. Maestro?\" Nestor asked with a tone of deep concern.\"Not even Pablito talks like that.\"I thought Pablito was going to protest. He almost stood up, but he seemed tochange his mind.\"Yes, that's right,\" he said. \"Not even I talk like that.\"\"Well, if Eligio didn't die, where is he?\" I asked.\"Soledad already told you,\" Nestor said softly. \"Eligio went to join the Nagualand Genaro.\"I decided that it was best not to ask any more questions. I did not mean myprobes to be aggressive, but they always turned out that way. Besides, I had thefeeling that they did not know much more than I did.Nestor suddenly stood up and began to pace back and forth in front of me.Finally he pulled me away from the table by my armpits. He did not want me towrite. He asked me if I had really blacked out like Pablito had at the moment ofjumping and did not remember anything. I told him that I had had a number ofvivid dreams or visions that I could not explain and that I had come to see themto seek clarification. They wanted to hear about all the visions I had had.After they had heard my accounts, Nestor said that my visions were of a bizarreorder and only the first two were of great importance and of this earth. Therest were visions of alien worlds. He explained that my first vision was ofspecial value because it was an omen proper. He said that sorcerers always tooka first event of any series as the blueprint or the map of what was going todevelop subsequently.In that particular vision I had found myself looking at an outlandish world.There was an enormous rock right in front of my eyes, a rock which had beensplit in two. Through a wide gap in it I could see a boundless phosphorescentplain, a valley of some sort, which was bathed in a greenish-yellow light.On one side of the valley, to the right, and partially covered from my view bythe enormous rock, there was an unbelievable domelike structure. It was dark,almost a charcoal gray. If my size was what it is in the world of everyday life,the dome must have been fifty thousand feet high and miles and miles across.Such an enormity dazzled me. I had a sensation of vertigo and plummeted into astate of disintegration.Once more I rebounded from it and found myself on a very uneven and yet flatsurface. It was a shiny, interminable surface just like the plain I had seenbefore. It went as far as I could see. I soon realized that I could turn my headin any direction I wanted on a horizontal plane, but I could not look at myself.I was able, however, to examine the surroundings by rotating my head from leftto right and vice versa. Nevertheless, when I wanted to turn around to lookbehind me, I could not move my bulk.The plain extended itself monotonously, equally to my left and to my right.There was nothing else in sight but an endless, whitish glare. I wanted to lookat the ground underneath my feet but my eyes could not move down. I lifted myhead up to look at the sky. All I saw was another limitless, whitish surfacethat seemed to be connected to the one I was standing on. I then had a moment ofapprehension and felt that something was just about to be revealed to me. Butthe sudden and devastating jolt of disintegration stopped my revelation. Someforce pulled me downward. It was as if the whitish surface had swallowed me.Nestor said that my vision of a dome was of tremendous importance because thatparticular shape had been isolated by the Nagual and Genaro as the vision of theplace where all of us were supposed to meet them someday.Benigno spoke to me at that point and said that he had heard Eligio beinginstructed to find that particular dome. He said that the Nagual and Genaroinsisted that Eligio understand their point correctly. They always had believedEligio to be the best. Therefore they directed him to find that dome and toenter its whitish vaults over and over again.Pablito said that all three of them were instructed to find that dome if theycould, but that none of them had. I said then, in a complaining tone, thatneither don Juan nor don Genaro had ever mentioned anything like that to me. Ihad had no instruction of any sort regarding a dome.Benigno, who was sitting across the table from me, suddenly stood up and came tomy side. He sat to my left and whispered very softly in my ear that perhaps thetwo old men had instructed me but I did not remember, or that they had not saidanything about it so I would not fix my attention on it once I had found it.\"Why was the dome so important?\" I asked Nestor.\"Because that's where the Nagual and Genaro are now,\" he replied.\"And where's that dome?\" I asked.\"Somewhere on this earth,\" he said.I had to explain to them at great length that it was impossible that a structureof that magnitude could exist on our planet. I said that my vision was more likea dream and domes of that height could exist only in fantasies. They laughed andpatted me gently as if they were humoring a child.\"You want to know where Eligio is,\" Nestor said all of a sudden. \"Well, he is inthe white vaults of that dome with the Nagual and Genaro.\"\"But that dome was a vision,\" I protested.\"Then Eligio is in a vision,\" Nestor said. \"Remember what Benigno just said toyou. The Nagual and Genaro didn't tell you to find that dome and go back to itover and over. If they had, you wouldn't be here. You'd be like Eligio, in thedome of that vision. So you see, Eligio did not die like a man in the streetdies. He simply did not return from his jump.\"His claim was staggering to me. I could not brush aside the memory of thevividness of the visions I had had, but for some strange reason I wanted toargue with him. Nestor, without giving me time to say anything, drove his pointa notch further. He reminded me of one of my visions; the next to the last.That particular one had been the most nightmarish of them all. I had foundmyself being chased by a strange, unseen creature. I knew that it was there butI could not see it, not because it was invisible but because the world I was inwas so incredibly unfamiliar that I could not tell what anything was. Whateverthe elements of my vision were, they were certainly not from this earth.The emotional distress I experienced upon being lost in such a place was almostmore than I could bear. At one moment, the surface where I stood began to shake.I felt that it was caving in under my feet and I grabbed a sort of branch, or anappendage of a thing that reminded me of a tree, which was hanging just above myhead on a horizontal plane.The instant I touched it, the thing wrapped around my wrist, as if had beenfilled with nerves that sensed everything. I felt that I was being hoisted to atremendous height. I looked down and saw an incredible animal. I knew it was theunseen creature that had been chasing me. It was coming out of a surface thatlooked like the ground. I could see its enormous mouth open like a cavern. Iheard a chilling, thoroughly unearthly roar, something like a shrill, metallicgasp, and the tentacle that had me caught unraveled and I fell into thatcavernous mouth, I saw every detail of that mouth as I was falling into it. Thenit closed with me inside. I felt an instantaneous pressure that mashed my body.\"You have already died,\" Nestor said. \"That animal ate you. You ventured beyondthis world and found horror itself. Our life and our death are no more and noless real than your short life in that place and your death in the mouth of thatmonster. This life that we are having now is only a long vision. Don't you see?\"Nervous spasms ran through my body.\"I didn't go beyond this world,\" he went on, \"but I know what I'm talking about.I don't have tales of horror like you. All I did was to visit Porfirio tentimes. If it had been up to me I would've gone there forever, but my eleventhbounce was so powerful that it changed my direction.\"I felt that I had overshot Porfirio's hut, and instead of finding myself at hisdoor, I found myself in the city, very close to the place of a friend of mine. Ithought it was funny. I knew that I was journeying between the tonal and thenagual.\"Nobody had said to me that the journeys had to be of any special kind. So I gotcurious and decided to see my friend. I began to wonder if I really would get tosee him. I came to his house and knocked on the door just as I had knockedscores of times.\"His wife let me in as she had always done and sure enough my friend was home. Itold him that I had come to the city on business and he even paid me some moneyhe owed me. I put the money in my pocket. I knew that my friend, and his wife,and the money, and his house, and the city were just like Porfirio's hut, avision. I knew that a force beyond me was going to disintegrate me any moment.So I sat down to enjoy my friend to the fullest. We laughed and joked. And Idare say that I was funny and light and charming. I stayed there for a longtime, waiting for the jolt; since it didn't come I decided to leave. I saidgood-bye and thanked him for the money and for his friendship.\"I walked away. I wanted to see the city before the force took me away. Iwandered around all night. I walked all the way to the hills overlooking thecity, and at the moment the sun rose, a realization struck me like athunderbolt.\"I was back in the world and the force that will disintegrate me was at ease andwas going to let me stay for a while. I was going to see my homeland and thismarvelous earth for a while longer. What a great joy. Maestro! But I couldn'tsay that I had not enjoyed Porfirio's friendship. Both visions are equal, but Iprefer the vision of my form and my earth. It's my indulging perhaps.\"Nestor stopped talking and all of them stared at me. I felt threatened as I hadnever been before. Some part of me was in awe of what he had said. Anotherwanted to fight with him. I began to argue with him without any sense. My inanemood lasted for a few moments, then I became aware that Benigno was looking atme with a very mean expression.He had fixed his eyes on my chest. I felt that something ominous was suddenlypressing on my heart. I began to perspire as if a heater were right in front ofmy face. My ears began to buzz.La Gorda walked up to me at that precise moment. She was a most unexpectedsight. I was sure that the Genaros felt the same way. They stopped what theywere doing and looked at her. Pablito was the first to recover from hissurprise.\"Why do you have to come in like that?\" he asked in a pleading tone. \"You werelistening from the other room, weren't you?\"She said that she had been in the house only a few minutes and then she steppedout to the kitchen. And the reason she stayed quiet was not so much to listen,but to exercise her ability to be inconspicuous. Her presence had created astrange lull.I wanted to pick up again the flow of Nestor's revelations, but before I couldsay anything la Gorda said that the little sisters were on their way to thehouse and would be coming through the door any minute. The Genaros stood up atonce as if they had been pulled by the same string. Pablito put his chair on hisshoulder.\"Let's go for a hike in the dark. Maestro,\" Pablito said to me.La Gorda said in a most imperative tone that I could not go with them yetbecause she had not finished telling me everything the Nagual had instructed herto tell me.Pablito turned to me and winked.\"I've told you,\" he said. \"They're bossy, gloomy bitches. I certainly hopeyou're not like that, Maestro.\"Nestor and Benigno said good night and embraced me. Pablito just walked awaycarrying his chair like a backpack. They went out through the back.A few seconds later a horribly loud bang on the front door made la Gorda and mejump to our feet. Pablito walked in again, carrying his chair.\"You thought I wasn't going to say good night, didn't you?\" he asked me and leftlaughing. ================================================================="},{"pageContent":"5. The Art of Dreaming The next day I was by myself all morning. I worked on my notes, in the afternoonI used my car to help la Gorda and the little sisters transport the furniturefrom dona Soledad's house to their house.In the early evening la Gorda and I sat in the dining area alone. We were silentfor a while. I was very tired.La Gorda broke the silence and said that all of them had been too complacentsince the Nagual and Genaro had left. Each of them had been absorbed in his orher particular tasks. She said that the Nagual had commanded her to be animpassionate warrior and to follow whatever path her fate selected for her.If Soledad had stolen my power, la Gorda had to flee and try to save the littlesisters and then join Benigno and Nestor, the only two Genaros who would havesurvived. If the little sisters had killed me, she had to join the Genarosbecause the little sisters would have had no more need to be with her. If I hadnot survived the attack of the allies and she did, she had to leave that areaand be on her own. She told me, with a glint in her eye, that she had been surethat neither one of us would survive, and that was why she had said good-bye toher sisters, to her house and to the hills.\"The Nagual told me that in case you and I survived the allies,\" she went on, \"Ihave to do anything for yo, because that would be my warrior's path. That waswhy I interfered with what Benigno was doing to you last night. He was pressingon your chest with his eyes. That is his art as a stalker. You saw Pablito'shand earlier yesterday. That was also part of the same art.\"\"What art is that, Gorda?\"\"The art of the stalker. That was the Nagual's predilection and the Genaros arehis true children at that. We, on the other hand, are dreamers. Your double isdreaming.\"What she was saying was new to me. I wanted her to elucidate her statements. Ipaused for a moment to read what I had written in order to select the mostappropriate question. I told her that I first wanted to find out what she knewabout my double and then I wanted to know about the art of stalking.\"The Nagual told me that your double is something that takes a lot of power tocome out,\" she said. \"He figured that you might have enough energy to get it outof you twice. That's why he set up Soledad and the little sisters either to killyou or to help you.\"La Gorda said that I had had more energy than the Nagual thought, and that mydouble came out three times. Apparently Rosa's attack had not been a thoughtlessaction. On the contrary, she had very cleverly calculated that if she injuredme, I would have been helpless; the same ploy dona Soledad had tried with herdog. I had given Rosa a chance to strike me when I yelled at her, but she failedto injure me. My double came out and injured her instead.La Gorda said that Lidia told her that Rosa did not want to wake up when all ofus had to rush out of Soledad's house, so Lidia squeezed the hand that had beeninjured. Rosa did not feel any pain and knew in an instant that I had cured her,which meant to them that I had drained my power.La Gorda affirmed that the little sisters were very clever and had planned todrain me of power. To that effect they had kept on insisting that I cureSoledad. As soon as Rosa realized that I had also cured her, she thought that Ihad weakened myself beyond repair. All they had to do was to wait for Josefinain order to finish me off.\"The little sisters didn't know that when you cured Rosa and Soledad you alsoreplenished yourself,\" la Gorda said, and laughed as if it were a joke. \"Thatwas why you had enough energy to get your double out a third time when thelittle sisters tried to take your luminosity.\"I told her about the vision I had had of dona Soledad huddled against the wallof her room, and how I had merged that vision with my tactile sense and ended upfeeling a viscous substance on her forehead.\"That was true seeing,\" la Gorda said. \"You saw Soledad in her room although shewas with me around Genaro's place, and then you saw your nagual on herforehead.\"I felt compelled at that point to recount to her the details of my wholeexperience, especially the realization I had had that I was actually curing donaSoledad and Rosa by touching the viscous substance, which I felt was part of me.\"To see that thing on Rosa's hand was also true seeing,\" she said. \"And you wereabsolutely right; that substance was yourself. It came out of your body and itwas your nagual. By touching it, you pulled it back.\"La Gorda told me then, as though she were unveiling a mystery, that the Nagualhad commanded her not to disclose the fact that since all of us had the sameluminosity, if my nagual touched one of them, I would not get weakened, as wouldordinarily be the case if my nagual touched an average man.\"If your nagual touches us,\" she said, giving me a gentle slap on the head,\"your luminosity stays on the surface. You can pick it up again and nothing islost.\"I told her that the content of her explanation was impossible for me to believe.She shrugged her shoulders as if saying that that was not any of her concern. Iasked her then about her usage of the word \"nagual\". I said that don Juan hadexplained the nagual to me as being the indescribable principle; the source ofeverything.\"Sure,\" she said smiling. \"I know what he meant. The nagual is in everything.\"I pointed out to her, a bit scornfully, that one could also say the opposite,that the tonal is in everything. She carefully explained that there was noopposition, that my statement was correct, the tonal was also in everything. Shesaid that the tonal which is in everything could be easily apprehended by oursenses, while the nagual which is in everything manifested itself only to theeye of the sorcerer.She added that we could stumble upon the most outlandish sights of the tonal andbe scared of them, or awed by them, or be indifferent to them, because all of uscould view those sights. A sight of the nagual, on the other hand, needed thespecialized senses of a sorcerer in order to be seen at all. And yet, both thetonal and the nagual were present in everything at all times.It was appropriate, therefore, for a sorcerer to say that 'looking' consisted inviewing the tonal which is in everything, and 'seeing', on the other hand,consisted in viewing the nagual which also is in everything. Accordingly, if awarrior observed the world as a human being, he was looking, but if he observedit as a sorcerer, he was seeing- and what he was seeing had to be properlycalled the nagual.She then reiterated the reason, which Nestor had given me earlier, for callingdon Juan the Nagual and confirmed that I was also the Nagual because of theshape that came out of my head.I wanted to know why they had called the shape that had come out of my head thedouble. She said that they had thought they were sharing a private joke with me.They had always called that shape the double, because it was twice the size ofthe person who had it.\"Nestor told me that that shape was not such a good thing to have,\" I said.\"It's neither good nor bad,\" she said. \"You have it and that makes you theNagual. That's all. One of us eight had to be the Nagual and you're the one. Itmight have been Pablito or me or anyone.\"\"Tell me now, what is the art of stalking?\" I asked.\"The Nagual was a stalker,\" she said, and peered at me. \"You must know that. Hetaught you to stalk from the beginning.\"It occurred to me that what she was referring to was what don Juan had calledthe hunter. He had certainly taught me to be a hunter. I told her that don Juanhad shown me how to hunt and make traps. Her usage of the term stalker, however,was more accurate.\"A hunter just hunts,\" she said. \"A stalker stalks anything, including himself.\"\"How does he do that?\"\"An impeccable stalker can turn anything into prey. The Nagual told me that wecan even stalk our own weaknesses.\"I stopped writing and tried to remember if don Juan had ever presented me withsuch a novel possibility; to stalk my weaknesses. I could not recall him everputting it in those terms.\"How can one stalk one's weaknesses, Gorda?\"\"The same way you stalk prey. You figure out your routines until you know allthe doing of your weaknesses and then you come upon them and pick them up likerabbits inside a cage.\"Don Juan had taught me the same thing about routines but in the vein of ageneral principle that hunters must be aware of. Her understanding andapplication of it, however, were more pragmatic than mine.Don Juan had said that any habit was, in essence, a 'doing', and that a doingneeded all its parts in order to function. If some parts were missing, a doingwas disassembled. By doing, he meant any coherent and meaningful series ofactions. In other words, a habit needed all its component actions in order to bea live activity.La Gorda then described how she had stalked her own weakness of eatingexcessively. She said that the Nagual had suggested she first tackle the biggestpart of that habit, which was connected with her laundry work. She ate whateverher customers fed her as she went from house to house delivering her wash.She expected the Nagual to tell her what to do, but he only laughed and made funof her saying that as soon as he would mention something for her to do, shewould fight not to do it. He said that that was the way human beings are; theylove to be told what to do, but they love even more to fight and not do whatthey are told, and thus they get entangled in hating the one who told them inthe first place.For many years she could not think of anything to do to stalk her weakness. Oneday, however, she got so sick and tired of being fat that she refused to eat fortwenty-three days. That was the initial action that broke her fixation. She thenhad the idea of stuffing her mouth with a sponge to make her customers believethat she had an infected tooth and could not eat. The subterfuge worked not onlywith her customers, who stopped giving her food, but with her as well, as shehad the feeling of eating as she chewed on the sponge. La Gorda laughed when shetold me how she had walked around with a sponge stuffed in her mouth for yearsuntil her habit of eating excessively had been broken.\"Was that all you needed to stop your habit?\" I asked.\"No. I also had to learn how to eat like a warrior.\"\"And how does a warrior eat?\"\"A warrior eats quietly, and slowly, and very little at a time. I used to talkwhile I ate, and I ate very fast, and I ate lots and lots of food at onesitting. The Nagual told me that a warrior eats four mouthfuls of food at onetime. A while later he eats another four mouthfuls and so on.\"A warrior also walks miles and miles every day. My eating weakness never let mewalk. I broke it by eating four mouthfuls every hour and by walking. Sometimes Iwalked all day and all night. That was the way I lost the fat on my buttocks.\"She laughed at her own recollection of the nickname don Juan had given her.\"But stalking your weaknesses is not enough to drop them,\" she said. \"You canstalk them from now to doomsday and it won't make a bit of difference. That'swhy the Nagual didn't want to tell me what to do. What a warrior really needs inorder to be an impeccable stalker is to have a purpose.\"La Gorda recounted how she had lived from day to day, before she met the Nagual,with nothing to look forward to. She had no hopes, no dreams, no desire foranything. The opportunity to eat, however, was always accessible to her. Forsome reason that she could not fathom, there had been plenty of food availableto her every single day of her life. So much of it, in fact, that at one timeshe weighed two hundred and thirty-six pounds.\"Eating was the only thing I enjoyed in life,\" la Gorda said. \"Besides, I neversaw myself as being fat. I thought I was rather pretty and that people liked meas I was. Everyone said that I looked healthy.\"The Nagual told me something very strange. He said that I had an enormousamount of personal power and due to that I had always managed to get food fromfriends while the relatives in my own house were going hungry.\"Everybody has enough personal power for something. The trick for me was to pullmy personal power away from food to my warrior's purpose.\"\"And what is that purpose, Gorda?\" I asked half in jest.\"To enter into the other world,\" she replied with a grin and pretended to hit meon top of my head with her knuckles the way don Juan used to do when he thoughtI was indulging.There was no more light for me to write. I wanted her to bring a lantern but shecomplained that she was too tired, and had to sleep a bit before the littlesisters arrived.We went into the front room. She gave me a blanket, then wrapped herself inanother one, and fell asleep instantly. The brick surface of the bed was hardeven with four straw mats. I sat with my back against the wall. Yet, it was morecomfortable to lie down. The moment I did I fell asleep. I woke up suddenly with an unbearable thirst. I wanted to go to the kitchen todrink some water, but I could not orient myself in the darkness. I could feel laGorda bundled up in her blanket next to me. I shook her two or three times andasked her to help me get some water. She grumbled some unintelligible words. Sheapparently was so sound asleep that she did not want to wake up.I shook her again and suddenly she woke up; only it was not la Gorda. Whoever Iwas shaking yelled at me in a gruff, masculine voice to shut up. There was a manthere in place of la Gorda! My fright was instantaneous and uncontrollable.I jumped out of bed and ran for the front door. But my sense of orientation wasoff and I ended up out in the kitchen. I grabbed a lantern and lit it as fast asI could.La Gorda came out of the outhouse in the back at that moment and asked me ifthere was something wrong. I nervously told her what had happened. She seemed abit disoriented herself. Her mouth was open and her eyes had lost their usualsheen. She shook her head vigorously and that seemed to restore her alertness.She took the lantern and we walked into the front room.There was no one in the bed. La Gorda lit three more lanterns. She appeared tobe worried. She told me to stay where I was, then she opened the door to theirroom. I noticed that there was light coming from inside. She closed the dooragain and said in a matter-of-fact tone not to worry, that it was nothing, andthat she was going to make us something to eat.With the speed and efficiency of a short-order cook she made some food. She alsomade a hot chocolate drink with cornmeal. We sat across from each other and atein complete silence.The night was cold. It looked as if it was going to rain. The three kerosenelanterns that she had brought to the dining area cast a yellowish light that wasvery soothing. She took some boards that were stacked up on the floor, againstthe wall, and placed them vertically in a deep groove on the transversesupporting beam of the roof. There was a long slit in the floor parallel to thebeam that served to hold the boards in place. The result was a portable wallthat enclosed the dining area.\"Who was in the bed?\" I asked.\"In bed, next to you, was Josefina, who else?\" she replied as if savoring herwords, and then laughed. \"She's a master at jokes like that. For a moment Ithought it was something else, but then I caught the scent that Josefina's bodyhas when she's carrying out one of her pranks.\"\"What was she trying to do? Scare me to death?\" I asked.\"You're not their favorite, you know,\" she replied. \"They don't like to be takenout of the path they're familiar with. They hate the fact that Soledad isleaving. They don't want to understand that we are all leaving this area. Itlooks like our time is up. I knew that today. As I left the house I felt thatthose barren hills out there were making me tired. I had never felt that wayuntil today.\"\"Where are you going to go?\"\"I don't know yet. It looks as if that depends on you. On your power.\"\"On me? In what way, Gorda?\"\"Let me explain. The day before you arrived the little sisters and I went to thecity. I wanted to find you in the city because I had a very strange vision in mydreaming.\"In that vision I was in the city with you. I saw you in my vision as plainly asI see you now. You didn't know who I was but you talked to me. I couldn't makeout what you said. I went back to the same vision three times but I was notstrong enough in my dreaming to find out what you were saying to me.\"I figured that my vision was telling me that I had to go to the city and trustmy power to find you there. I was sure that you were on your way.\"\"Did the little sisters know why you took them to the city?\" I asked.\"I didn't tell them anything,\" she replied. \"I just took them there. We wanderedaround the streets all morning.\"Her statements put me in a very strange frame of mind. Spasms of nervousexcitation ran through my entire body. I had to stand up and walk around for amoment. I sat down again and told her that I had been in the city the same day,and that I had wandered around the marketplace all afternoon looking for donJuan. She stared at me with her mouth open.\"We must have passed each other,\" she said and sighed. \"We were in the marketand in the park. We sat on the steps of the church most of the afternoon so asnot to attract attention to ourselves.\"The hotel where I had stayed was practically next door to the church. Iremembered that I had stood for a long time looking at the people on the stepsof the church. Something was pulling me to examine them. I had the absurd notionthat both don Juan and don Genaro were going to be among those people, sittinglike beggars just to surprise me.\"When did you leave the city?\" I asked.\"We left around five o'clock and headed for the Nagual's spot in the mountains,\"she replied.I had also had the certainty that don Juan had left at the end of the day. Thefeelings I had had during that entire episode of looking for don Juan becamevery clear to me. In light of what she had told me I had to revise my stand. Ihad conveniently explained away the certainty I had had that don Juan was therein the streets of the city as an irrational expectation, a result of myconsistently finding him there in the past.But la Gorda had been in the city actually looking for me and she was the beingclosest to don Juan in temperament. I had felt all along that his presence wasthere. La Gorda's statement had merely confirmed something that my body knewbeyond the shadow of a doubt.I noticed a flutter of nervousness in her body when I told her the details of mymood that day.\"What would've happened if you had found me?\" I asked.\"Everything would've been changed,\" she replied. \"For me to find you would'vemeant that I had enough power to move forward. That's why I took the littlesisters with me. All of us, you, me and the little sisters, would've gone awaytogether that day.\"\"Where to, Gorda?\"\"Who knows? If I had the power to find you I would've also had the power to knowthat. It's your turn now. Perhaps you will have enough power now to know wherewe should go. Do you see what I mean?\"I had an attack of profound sadness at that point. I felt more acutely than everthe despair of my human frailty and temporariness.Don Juan had always maintained that the only deterrent to our despair was theawareness of our death; the key to the sorcerer's scheme of things. His idea wasthat the awareness of our death was the only thing that could give us thestrength to withstand the duress and pain of our lives and our fears of theunknown.But what he could never tell me was how to bring that awareness to theforeground. He had insisted, every time I had asked him, that my volition alonewas the deciding factor. In other words, I had to make up my mind to bring thatawareness to bear witness to my acts. I thought I had done so.But confronted with la Gorda's determination to find me and go away with me, Irealized that if she had found me in the city that day I would never havereturned to my home. Never again would I have seen those I held dear. I had notbeen prepared for that. I had braced myself for dying, but not for disappearingfor the rest of my life in full awareness without anger or disappointment;leaving behind the best of my feelings.I was almost embarrassed to tell la Gorda that I was not a warrior worthy ofhaving the kind of power that must be needed to perform an act of that nature;to leave for good and to know where to go and what to do.\"We are human creatures,\" she said. \"Who knows what's waiting for us or whatkind of power we may have?\"I told her that my sadness in leaving like that was too great. The changes thatsorcerers went through were too drastic and too final. I recounted to her whatPablito had told me about his unbearable sadness at having lost his mother.\"The human form feeds itself on those feelings,\" she said dryly. \"I pitiedmyself and my little children for years. I couldn't understand how the Nagualcould be so cruel to ask me to do what I did; to leave my children, to destroythem and to forget them.\"She said that it took her years to understand that the Nagual also had had tochoose to leave the human form. He was not being cruel. He simply did not haveany more human feelings. To him everything was equal. He had accepted his fate.The problem with Pablito, and myself for that matter, was that neither of us hadaccepted our fate. La Gorda said, in a scornful way, that Pablito wept when heremembered his mother, his Manuelita, especially when he had to cook his ownfood. She urged me to remember Pablito's mother as she was; an old stupid womanwho knew nothing else but to be Pablito's servant. She said that the reason allof them thought he was a coward was because he could not be happy that hisservant Manuelita had become the witch Soledad who could kill him like she wouldstep on a bug.La Gorda stood up dramatically and leaned over the table until her forehead wasalmost touching mine.\"The Nagual said that Pablito's good fortune was extraordinary,\" she said.\"Mother and son fighting for the same thing. If he weren't the coward he is, hewould accept his fate and oppose Soledad like a warrior; without fear or hatred.In the end the best would win and take all. If Soledad is the winner, Pablitoshould be happy with his fate and wish her well. But only a real warrior canfeel that kind of happiness.\"\"How does dona Soledad feel about all this?\"\"She doesn't indulge in her feelings,\" la Gorda replied and sat down again. \"Shehas accepted her fate more readily than any one of us. Before the Nagual helpedher she was worse off than myself. At least I was young. She was an old cow; fatand tired; begging for her death to come. Now death will have to fight to claimher.\"The time element in dona Soledad's transformation was a detail that had puzzledme. I told la Gorda that I remembered having seen dona Soledad no more than twoyears before and she was the same old lady I had always known.La Gorda said that the last time I had been in Soledad's house- under theimpression that it was still Pablito's house- the Nagual had set them up to actas if everything were the same. Dona Soledad greeted me as she always did fromthe kitchen, and I really did not face her. Lidia, Rosa, Pablito and Nestorplayed their roles to perfection in order to keep me from finding out abouttheir true activities.\"Why would the Nagual go to all that trouble, Gorda?\"\"He was saving you for something that's not clear yet. He kept you away fromevery one of us deliberately. He and Genaro told me never to show my face whenyou were around.\"\"Did they tell Josefina the same thing? \"\"Yes. She's crazy and can't help herself. She wanted to play her pranks on you.She used to follow you around and you never knew it. One night when the Nagualhad taken you to the mountains, she nearly pushed you down a ravine in thedarkness. The Nagual found her in the nick of time.\"She doesn't do those things out of meanness, but because she enjoys being thatway. That's her human form. She'll be that way until she loses it. I've told youthat all six of them are a bit off. You must be aware of that so as not to becaught in their webs. If you do get caught, don't get angry. They can't helpthemselves.\"She was silent for a while. I caught the almost imperceptible sign of a flutterin her body. Her eyes seemed to get out of focus and her mouth dropped as if themuscles of her jaw had given in. I became engrossed in watching her. She shookher head two or three times.\"I've just seen something,\" she said. \"You're just like the little sisters andthe Genaros.\"She began to laugh quietly. I did not say anything. I wanted her to explainherself without my meddling.\"Everybody gets angry with you because it hasn't dawned on them yet that you'reno different than they are,\" she went on. \"They see you as the Nagual and theydon't understand that you indulge in your ways just like they do in theirs.\"She said that Pablito whined and complained and played at being a weakling.Benigno played the shy one; the one who could not even open his eyes. Nestorplayed to be the wise one; the one who knows everything. Lidia played the toughwoman who could crush anyone with a look. Josefina was the crazy one who couldnot be trusted. Rosa was the bad-tempered girl who ate the mosquitoes that bither. And I was the fool that came from Los Angeles with a pad of paper and lotsof wrong questions. And all of us loved to be the way we were.\"I was once a fat, smelly woman,\" she went on after a pause. \"I didn't mindbeing kicked around like a dog as long as I was not alone. That was my form.\"I will have to tell everybody what I have seen about you so they won't feeloffended by your acts.\"I did not know what to say. I felt that she was undeniably right. The importantissue for me was not so much her accurateness, but the fact that I had witnessedher arriving at her unquestionable conclusion.\"How did you see all that?\" I asked.\"It just came to me,\" she replied.\"How did it come to you?\"\"I felt the feeling of seeing coming to the top of my head, and then I knew whatI've just told you.\"I insisted that she describe to me every detail of the feeling of seeing thatshe was alluding to. She complied after a moment's vacillation and gave me anaccount of the same ticklish sensation I had become so aware of during myconfrontations with dona Soledad and the little sisters. La Gorda said that thesensation started on the top of her head and then went down her back and aroundher waist to her womb. She felt it inside her body as a consuming ticklishness,which turned into the knowledge that I was clinging to my human form, like allthe rest, except that my particular way was incomprehensible to them.\"Did you hear a voice telling you all that?\" I asked.\"No. I just saw everything I've told you about yourself,\" she replied.I wanted to ask her if she had had a vision of me clinging to something, but Idesisted. I did not want to indulge in my usual behavior. Besides, I knew whatshe meant when she said that she saw. The same thing had happened to me when Iwas with Rosa and Lidia. I suddenly 'knew' where they lived. I had not had avision of their house. I simply felt that I knew it.I asked her if she had also felt a dry sound of a wooden pipe being broken atthe base of her neck.\"The Nagual taught all of us how to get the feeling on top of the head,\" shesaid. \"But not everyone of us can do it. The sound behind the throat is evenmore difficult. None of us has ever felt it yet. It's strange that you have whenyou're still empty.\"\"How does that sound work?\" I asked. \"And what is it?\"\"You know that better than I do. What more can I tell you?\" she replied in aharsh voice.She seemed to catch herself being impatient. She smiled sheepishly and loweredher head.\"I feel stupid telling you what you already know,\" she said. \"Do you ask mequestions like that to test if I have really lost my form?\"I told her that I was confused, for I had the feeling that I knew what thatsound was and yet it was as if I did not know anything about it, because for meto know something I actually had to be able to verbalize my knowledge. In thiscase, I did not even know how to begin verbalizing it. The only thing I coulddo, therefore, was to ask her questions, hoping that her answers would help me.\"I can't help you with that sound,\" she said.I experienced a sudden and tremendous discomfort. I told her that I washabituated to dealing with don Juan and that I needed him then, more than ever,to explain everything to me.\"Do you miss the Nagual?\" she asked.I said that I did, and that I had not realized how much I missed him until I wasback again in his homeland.\"You miss him because you're still clinging to your human form,\" she said, andgiggled as if she were delighted at my sadness.\"Don't you miss him yourself, Gorda?\"\"No. Not me. I'm him. All my luminosity has been changed. How could I misssomething that is myself?\"\"How is your luminosity different?\"\"A human being, or any other living creature, has a pale yellow glow. Animalsare more yellow, humans are more white. But a sorcerer is amber, like clearhoney in the sunlight. Some women sorceresses are greenish. The Nagual said thatthose are the most powerful and the most difficult.\"\"What color are you, Gorda?\"\"Amber, just like you and all the rest of us. That's what the Nagual and Genarotold me. I've never seen myself. But I've seen everyone else. All of us areamber. And all of us, with the exception of you, are like a tombstone. Averagehuman beings are like eggs; that's why the Nagual called them luminous eggs.Sorcerers change not only the color of their luminosity but their shape. We arelike tombstones; only we are round at both ends.\"\"Am I still shaped like an egg, Gorda?\"\"No. You're shaped like a tombstone, except that you have an ugly, dull patch inyour middle. As long as you have that patch you won't be able to fly, likesorcerers fly, like I flew last night for you. You won't even be able to dropyour human form.\"I became entangled in a passionate argument not so much with her as with myself.I insisted that their stand on how to regain that alleged completeness wassimply preposterous. I told her that she could not possibly argue successfullywith me that one had to turn one's back to one's own children in order to pursuethe vaguest of all possible goals; to enter into the world of the nagual. I wasso thoroughly convinced that I was right that I got carried away and shoutedangry words at her. She was not in any way flustered by my outburst.\"Not everybody has to do that,\" she said. \"Only sorcerers who want to enter intothe other world. There are plenty of good sorcerers who see and are incomplete.To be complete is only for us Toltecs.\"Take Soledad, for instance. She's the best witch you can find and she'sincomplete. She had two children; one of them was a girl. Fortunately forSoledad her daughter died.\"The Nagual said that the edge of the spirit of a person who dies goes back tothe givers, meaning that that edge goes back to the parents.\"If the givers are dead and the person has children, the edge goes to the childwho is complete.\"And if all the children are complete, that edge goes to the one with power andnot necessarily to the best or the most diligent.\"For example, when Josefina's mother died, the edge went to the craziest of thelot, Josefina. It should have gone to her brother who is a hardworking,responsible man, but Josefina is more powerful than her brother. Soledad'sdaughter died without leaving any children and Soledad got a boost that closedhalf her hole. Now, the only hope she has to close it completely is for Pablitoto die. And by the same token, Pablito's great hope for a boost is for Soledadto die.\"I told her in very strong terms that what she was saying was disgusting andhorrifying to me. She agreed that I was right. She affirmed that at one time sheherself had believed that that particular sorcerers' stand was the ugliest thingpossible. She looked at me with shining eyes. There was something maliciousabout her grin.\"The Nagual told me that you understand everything but you don't want to doanything about it,\" she said in a soft voice.I began to argue again. I told her that what the Nagual had said about me hadnothing to do with my revulsion for the particular stand that we werediscussing. I explained that I liked children, that I had the most profoundrespect for them, and that I empathized very deeply with their helplessness inthe awesome world around them. I could not conceive hurting a child in anysense, not for any reason.\"The Nagual didn't make the rule,\" she said. \"The rule is made somewhere outthere, and not by a man.\"I defended myself by saying that I was not angry with her or the Nagual but thatI was arguing in the abstract, because I could not fathom the value of it all.\"The value is that we need all our edge, all our power, and our completeness inorder to enter into that other world,\" she said. \"I was a religious woman. Icould tell you what I used to repeat without knowing what I meant. I wanted mysoul to enter the kingdom of heaven. I still want that, except that I'm on adifferent path. The world of the nagual is the kingdom of heaven.\"I objected to her religious connotation on principle. I had become accustomed bydon Juan never to dwell on that subject. She very calmly explained that she sawno difference in terms of life-style between us and true nuns and priests. Shepointed out that not only were true nuns and priests complete as a rule, butthey did not even weaken themselves with sexual acts.\"The Nagual said that that is the reason they will never be exterminated, nomatter who tries to exterminate them,\" she said. \"Those who are after them arealways empty. They don't have the vigor that true nuns and priests have. I likedthe Nagual for saying that. I will always cheer for the nuns and priests. We arealike. We have given up the world and yet we are in the midst of it. Priests andnuns would make great flying sorcerers if someone would tell them that they cando it.\"The memory of my father's and my grandfather's admiration for the Mexicanrevolution came to my mind. They mostly admired the attempt to exterminate theclergy. My father inherited that admiration from his father and I inherited itfrom both of them. It was a sort of affiliation that we had. One of the firstthings that don Juan undermined in my personality was that affiliation.I once told don Juan, as if I were voicing my own opinion, something I had heardall my life, that the favorite ploy of the Church was to keep us in ignorance.Don Juan had a most serious expression on his face. It was as if my statementshad touched a deep fiber in him. I thought immediately of the centuries ofexploitation that the Indians had endured.\"Those dirty bastards,\" he said. \"They have kept me in ignorance, and you too.\"I caught his irony right away and we both laughed. I had never really examinedthat stand. I did not believe it but I had nothing else to take its place. Itold don Juan about my grandfather and my father and their views on religion asthe liberal men they were.\"It doesn't matter what anybody says or does,\" he said. \"You must be animpeccable man yourself. The fight is right here in this chest.\"He patted my chest gently.\"If your grandfather and father would be trying to be impeccable warriors,\" donJuan went on, \"they wouldn't have time for petty fights. It takes all the timeand all the energy we have to conquer the idiocy in us. And that's what matters.The rest is of no importance. Nothing of what your grandfather or father saidabout the Church gave them well-being. To be an impeccable warrior, on the otherhand, will give you vigor and youth and power. So, it is proper for you tochoose wisely.\"My choice was the impeccability and simplicity of a warrior's life. Because ofthat choice I felt that I had to take la Gorda's words in a most serious mannerand that was more threatening to me than even don Genaro's acts. He used tofrighten me at a most profound level. His actions, although terrifying, wereassimilated into the coherent continuum of their teachings. La Gorda's words andactions were a different kind of threat to me; somehow more concrete and realthan the other.La Gorda's body shivered for a moment. A ripple went through it, making hercontract the muscles of her shoulders and arms. She grabbed the edge of thetable with an awkward rigidity. Then she relaxed until she was again her usualself.She smiled at me. Her eyes and smile were dazzling. She said in a casual tonethat she had just 'seen' my dilemma.\"It's useless to close your eyes and pretend that you don't want to do anythingor that you don't know anything,\" she said. \"You can do that with people but notwith me. I know now why the Nagual commissioned me to tell you all this. I'm anobody. You admire great people. The Nagual and Genaro were the greatest ofall.\"She stopped and examined me. She seemed to be waiting for my reaction to whatshe said.\"You fought against what the Nagual and Genaro told you- all the way,\" she wenton. \"That's why you're behind. And you fought them because they were great.That's your particular way of being.\"But you can't fight against what I tell you, because you can't look up to me atall. I am your peer. I am in your cycle. You like to fight those who are betterthan you. It's no challenge to fight my stand. So, those two devils have finallybagged you through me. Poor little Nagual, you've lost the game.\"She came closer to me and whispered in my ear that the Nagual had also said thatshe should never try to take my writing pad away from me because that would beas dangerous as trying to snatch a bone from a hungry dog's mouth.She put her arms around me, resting her head on my shoulders, and laughedquietly and softly.Her seeing had numbed me. I knew that she was absolutely right. She had peggedme to perfection. She hugged me for a long time with her head against mine. Theproximity of her body somehow was very soothing. She was just like don Juan atthat. She exuded strength and conviction and purpose. She was wrong to say thatI could not admire her.\"Let's forget this,\" she said suddenly. \"Let's talk about what we have to dotonight.\"\"What exactly are we going to do tonight, Gorda?\"\"We have our last appointment with power.\"\"Is it another dreadful battle with somebody?\"\"No. The little sisters are simply going to show you something that willcomplete your visit here. The Nagual told me that after that you may go away andnever return, or that you may choose to stay with us. Either way, what they haveto show you is their art. The art of the dreamer.\"\"And what is that art? \"\"Genaro told me that he tried time and time again to acquaint you with the artof the dreamer. He showed you his other body; his body of dreaming. Once he evenmade you be in two places at once, but your emptiness did not let you see whathe was pointing out to you. It looks as if all his efforts went through the holein your body.\"Now it seems that it is different. Genaro made the little sisters the dreamersthat they are and tonight they will show you Genaro's art. In that respect, thelittle sisters are the true children of Genaro.\"That reminded me of what Pablito had said earlier, that we were the children ofboth, and that we were Toltecs. I asked her what he had meant by that.\"The Nagual told me that sorcerers used to be called Toltecs in his benefactor'slanguage,\" she replied.\"And what language was that, Gorda?\"\"He never told me. But he and Genaro used to speak a language that none of uscould understand. And here, between all of us, we understand four Indianlanguages.\"\"Did don Genaro also say that he was a Toltec?\"\"His benefactor was the same man, so he also said the same thing.\"From la Gorda's responses I could surmise that she either did not know a greatdeal on the subject or she did not want to talk to me about it. I confronted herwith my conclusions. She confessed that she had never paid much attention to itand wondered why I was putting so much value on it. I practically gave her alecture on the ethnography of central Mexico.\"A sorcerer is a Toltec when that sorcerer has received the mysteries ofstalking and dreaming,\" she said casually. \"The Nagual and Genaro received thosemysteries from their benefactor and then they held them in their bodies. We aredoing the same, and because of that we are Toltecs like the Nagual and Genaro.\"The Nagual taught you and me equally to be dispassionate. I am moredispassionate than you because I'm formless. You still have your form and areempty, so you get caught in every snag. One day, however, you'll be completeagain and you'll understand then that the Nagual was right.\"He said that the world of people goes up and down, and people go up and downwith their world. As sorcerers we have no business following them in their upsand downs.\"The art of sorcerers is to be outside everything and be unnoticeable. And morethan anything else, the art of sorcerers is never to waste their power. TheNagual told me that your problem is that you always get caught in idiocies, likewhat you're doing now. I'm sure that you're going to ask everyone of us aboutthe Toltecs, but you're not going to ask anyone of us about our attention.\"Her laughter was clear and contagious. I admitted to her that she was right.Small issues had always fascinated me. I also told her that I was mystified byher usage of the word \"attention\".\"I've told you already what the Nagual told me about attention,\" she said. \"Wehold the images of the world with our attention. A male sorcerer is verydifficult to train because his attention is always closed, focused on something.A female, on the other hand, is always open because most of the time she is notfocusing her attention on anything. Especially during her menstrual period. TheNagual told me and then showed me that during that time I could actually let myattention go from the images of the world. If I don't focus my attention on theworld, the world collapses.\"\"How is that done, Gorda?\"\"It's very simple. When a woman menstruates she cannot focus her attention.That's the crack the Nagual told me about. Instead of fighting to focus, a womanshould let go of the images, by gazing fixedly at distant hills, or by gazing atwater, like a river, or by gazing at the clouds.\"If you gaze with your eyes open, you get dizzy and the eyes get tired, but ifyou half-close them and blink a lot and move them from mountain to mountain, orfrom cloud to cloud, you can look for hours, or days if necessary.\"The Nagual used to make us sit by the door and gaze at those round hills on theother side of the valley. Sometimes we used to sit there for days until thecrack would open.\"I wanted to hear more about it, but she stopped talking and hurriedly sat veryclose to me. She signaled me with her hand to listen. I heard a faint swishingsound and suddenly Lidia stepped out into the kitchen. I thought that she musthave been asleep in their room and the sound of our voices had woken her up.She had changed the Western clothes she had been wearing the last time I hadseen her and had put on a long dress like the Indian women of the area wore. Shehad a shawl on her shoulders and was barefoot. Her long dress, instead of makingher look older and heavier, made her look like a child clad in an older woman'sclothes.She walked up to the table and greeted la Gorda with a formal \"Good evening,Gorda.\" She then turned to me and said, \"Good evening, Nagual.\"Her greeting was so unexpected and her tone so serious that I was about tolaugh. I caught a warning from la Gorda. She pretended to be scratching the topof her head with the back of her left hand, which was clawed.I answered Lidia the same way la Gorda had: \"Good evening to you, Lidia.\"She sat down at the end of the table to the right of me. I did not know whetheror not to start up a conversation. I was about to say something when la Gordatapped my leg with her knee, and with a subtle movement of her eyebrows signaledme to listen. I heard again the muffled sound of a long dress as it touched thefloor. Josefina stood for a moment at the door before walking toward the table.She greeted Lidia, la Gorda and myself in that order. I could not keep astraight face with her. She was also wearing a long dress, a shawl and no shoes,but in her case the dress was three or four sizes larger and she had put a thickpadding into it. Her appearance was thoroughly incongruous. Her face was leanand young, but her body looked grotesquely bloated.She took a bench and placed it at the left end of the table and sat down. Allthree of them looked extremely serious. They were sitting with their legspressed together and their backs very straight.I heard once more the rustle of a dress and Rosa come out. She was dressed justlike the others and was also barefoot. Her greeting was as formal and the ordernaturally included Josefina. Everyone answered her in the same formal tone. Shesat across the table facing me. All of us remained in absolute silence for quitea while.La Gorda spoke suddenly, and the sound of her voice made everyone else jump. Shesaid, pointing to me, that the Nagual was going to show them his allies, andthat he was going to use his special call to bring them into the room.I tried to make a joke and said that the Nagual was not there, so he could notbring any allies. I thought they were going to laugh. La Gorda covered her faceand the little sisters glared at me. La Gorda put her hand on my mouth andwhispered in my ear that it was absolutely necessary that I refrain from sayingidiotic things. She looked right into my eyes and said that I had to call theallies by making the moths' call.I reluctantly began. But no sooner had I started than the spirit of the occasiontook over and I found that in a matter of seconds I had given my maximumconcentration to producing the sound. I modulated its outflow and controlled theair being expelled from my lungs in order to produce the longest possibletapping. It sounded very melodious.I took an enormous gasp of air to start a new series. I stopped immediately.Something outside the house was answering my call. The tapping sounds came fromall around the house, even from the roof. The little sisters stood up andhuddled like frightened children around la Gorda and myself.\"Please, Nagual, don't bring anything into the house,\" Lidia pleaded with me.Even la Gorda seemed a bit frightened. She gave me a strong command with herhand to stop. I had not intended to keep on producing the sound anyway. Theallies, however, either as formless forces or as beings that were prowlingoutside the door, were not dependent on my tapping sound. I felt again, as I hadfelt two nights before in don Genaro's house, an unbearable pressure, aheaviness leaning against the entire house. I could sense it in my navel as anitch, a nervousness that soon turned into sheer physical anguish.The three little sisters were beside themselves with fear, especially Lidia andJosefina. Both of them were whining like wounded dogs. All of them surrounded meand then clung to me. Rosa crawled under the table and pushed her head upbetween my legs. La Gorda stood behind me as calmly as she could. After a fewmoments the hysteria and fear of those three girls mounted to enormousproportions. La Gorda leaned over and whispered that I should make the oppositesound, the sound that would disperse them. I had a moment of supremeuncertainty. I really did not know any other sound. But then I had a quicksensation of ticklishness on the top of my head, a shiver in my body, and Iremembered out of nowhere a peculiar whistling that don Juan used to perform atnight and had endeavored to teach me. He had presented it to me as a means tokeep one's balance while walking so as not to stray away from the trail in thedarkness.I began my whistling and the pressure in my umbilical region ceased. La Gordasmiled and sighed with relief and the little sisters moved away from my side,giggling as if all of it had been merely a joke.I wanted to indulge in some soul-searching deliberations about the abrupttransition from the rather pleasant exchange I was having with la Gorda to thatunearthly situation. For an instant I pondered over whether or not the wholething was a ploy on their part. But I was too weak. I felt I was about to passout. My ears were buzzing. The tension around my stomach was so intense that Ibelieved I was going to become ill right there. I rested my head on the edge ofthe table. After a few minutes, however, I was again relaxed enough to sit upstraight.The three girls seemed to have forgotten how frightened they had been. In fact,they were laughing and pushing each other as they each tied their shawls aroundtheir hips. La Gorda did not seem nervous nor did she seem relaxed. Rosa waspushed at one moment by the other two girls and fell off the bench where allthree of them were sitting. She landed on her seat. I thought that she was goingto get furious but she giggled. I looked at la Gorda for directions. She wassitting with a very straight back. Her eyes were half-closed, fixed on Rosa. Thelittle sisters were laughing very loudly, like nervous schoolgirls. Lidia pushedJosefina and sent her tumbling over the bench to fall next to Rosa on the floor.The instant Josefina was on the floor their laughter stopped. Rosa and Josefinashook their bodies, making an incomprehensible movement with their buttocks.They moved them from side to side as if they were grinding something against thefloor. Then they sprang up like two silent jaguars and took Lidia by the arms.All three of them, without making the slightest noise, spun around a couple oftimes. Rosa and Josefina lifted Lidia by the armpits and carried her as theytiptoed two or three times around the table. Then all three of them collapsed asif they had springs on their knees that had contracted at the same time. Theirlong dresses puffed up, giving them the appearance of huge balls.As soon as they were on the floor they became even more quiet. There was noother sound except the soft swishing of their dresses as they rolled andcrawled. It was as if I were watching a three-dimensional movie with the soundturned off.La Gorda, who had been quietly sitting next to me watching them, suddenly stoodup and with the agility of an acrobat ran toward the door of their room at thecorner of the dining area. Before she reached the door she tumbled on her rightside and shoulder just enough to turn over once, then stood up, pulled by themomentum of her rolling, and flung open the door. She performed all hermovements with absolute quietness.The three girls rolled and crawled into the room like giant pill bugs. La Gordasignaled me to come over to where she was. We entered the room and she had mesit on the floor with my back against the frame of the door. She sat to my rightwith her back also against the frame. She made me interlock my fingers and thenplaced my hands over my belly button.I was at first forced to divide my attention between la Gorda, the littlesisters and the room. But once la Gorda had arranged my sitting position, myattention was taken up by the room. The three girls were lying in the middle ofa large, white, square room with a brick floor. There were four gasolinelanterns, one on each wall, placed on built-in supporting ledges approximatelysix feet above the ground. The room had no ceiling. The supporting beams of theroof had been darkened and that gave the effect of an enormous room with no top.The two doors were placed on the very corners opposite each other. As I lookedat the closed door across from where I was, I noticed that the walls of the roomwere oriented to follow the cardinal points. The door where we were was at thenorthwest corner.Rosa, Lidia and Josefina rolled counterclockwise around the room several times.I strained to hear the swish of their dresses but the silence was absolute. Icould only hear la Gorda breathing. The little sisters finally stopped and satdown with their backs against the wall, each under a lantern. Lidia sat at theeast wall, Rosa, at the north, and Josefina, at the west.La Gorda stood up, closed the door behind us and secured it with an iron bar.She made me slide over a few inches, without changing my position, until I wassitting with my back against the door. Then she silently rolled the length ofthe room and sat down underneath the lantern on the south wall. Her getting intothat sitting position seemed to be the cue.Lidia stood up and began to walk on the tips of her toes along the edges of theroom, close to the walls. It was not a walk proper but rather a soundlesssliding. As she increased her speed she began to move as if she were gliding,stepping on the angle between the floor and the walls. She would jump over Rosa,Josefina, la Gorda and myself every time she got to where we were sitting. Ifelt her long dress brushing me every time she went by. The faster she ran, thehigher she got on the wall. A moment came when Lidia was actually runningsilently around the four walls of the room seven or eight feet above the floor.The sight of her, running perpendicular to the walls, was so unearthly that itbordered on the grotesque. Her long gown made the sight even more eerie. Gravitydid not seem to have any effect on Lidia, but it did on her long skirt; itdragged downward. I felt it every time she passed over my head; sweeping my facelike a hanging drape.She had captured my attentiveness at a level I could not imagine. The strain ofgiving her my undivided attention was so great that I began to get stomachconvulsions. I felt her running with my stomach. My eyes were getting out offocus. With the last bit of my remaining concentration, I saw Lidia walk down onthe east wall diagonally and come to a halt in the middle of the room.She was panting, out of breath, and drenched in perspiration like la Gorda hadbeen after her flying display. She could hardly keep her balance. After a momentshe walked to her place at the east wall and collapsed on the floor like a wetrag. I thought she had fainted, but then I noticed that she was deliberatelybreathing through her mouth.After some minutes of stillness, long enough for Lidia to recover her strengthand sit up straight, Rosa stood up and ran without making a sound to the centerof the room, turned on her heels and ran back to where she had been sitting. Herrunning allowed her to gain the necessary momentum to make an outlandish jump.She leaped up in the air, like a basketball player, along the vertical span ofthe wall, and her hands went beyond the height of the wall, which was perhapsten feet. I saw her body actually hitting the wall, although there was nocorresponding crashing sound.I expected her to rebound to the floor with the force of the impact, but sheremained hanging there, attached to the wall like a pendulum. From where I satit looked as if she were holding a hook of some sort in her left hand. Sheswayed silently in a pendulum-like motion for a moment and then catapultedherself three or four feet over to her left by pushing her body away from thewall with her right arm, at the moment in which her swing was t he widest. Sherepeated the swaying and catapulting thirty or forty times. She went around thewhole room and then she went up to the beams of the roof where she dangledprecariously, hanging from an invisible hook.While she was on the beams I became aware that what I had thought was a hook inher left hand was actually some quality of that hand that made it possible forher to suspend her weight from it. It was the same hand she had attacked me withtwo nights before.Her display ended with her dangling from the beams over the very center of theroom. Suddenly she let go. She fell down from a height of fifteen or sixteenfeet. Her long dress flowed upward and gathered around her head. For an instant,before she landed without a sound, she looked like an umbrella turned inside outby the force of the wind; her thin, naked body looked like a stick attached tothe dark mass of her dress.My body felt the impact of her plummeting down, perhaps more than she didherself. She landed in a squat position and remained motionless, trying to catchher breath. I was sprawled out on the floor with painful cramps in my stomach.La Gorda rolled across the room, took her shawl and tied it around my umbilicalregion, like a band, looping it around my body two or three times. She rolledback to the south wall like a shadow.While she had been arranging the shawl around my waist, I had lost sight ofRosa. When I looked up she was again sitting by the north wall. A moment later,Josefina quietly moved to the center of the room. She paced back and forth withnoiseless steps, between where Lidia was sitting and her own spot at the westwall. She faced me all the time. Suddenly, as she approached her spot, sheraised her left forearm and placed it right in front of her face, as if shewanted to block me from her view. She hid half of her face for an instant behindher forearm. She lowered it and raised it again, that time hiding her entireface. She repeated the movement of lowering and raising her left forearmcountless times, as she paced soundlessly from one side of the room to theother. Every time she raised her forearm a bigger portion of her bodydisappeared from my view. A moment came when she had hidden her entire body,puffed up with clothes, behind her thin forearm.It was as if by blocking her view of my body, sitting ten to twelve feet awayfrom her, a thing she could have easily done with the width of her forearm, shealso made me block the view of her body, a thing which could not possibly bedone with just the width of her forearm.Once she had hidden her entire body, all I was able to make out was a silhouetteof a forearm suspended in midair, bouncing from one side of the room to theother, and at one point I could hardly see the arm itself.I felt a revulsion, an unbearable nausea. The bouncing forearm depleted me ofenergy. I slid down on my side, unable to keep my balance. I saw the arm fallingto the ground. Josefina was lying on the floor covered with garments, as if herpuffed-up clothes had exploded. She lay on her back with her arms spread out.It took a long time to get back my physical balance. My clothes were soaked inperspiration. I was not the only one affected. All of them were exhausted anddrenched in sweat. La Gorda was the most poised, but her control seemed to be onthe verge of collapsing. I could hear all of them, including la Gorda, breathingthrough their mouths.When I was in full control again everybody sat on her spot. The little sisterswere looking at me fixedly. I saw out of the corner of my eye that la Gorda'seyes were half-closed. She suddenly rolled noiselessly to my side and whisperedin my ear that I should begin to make my moth call, keeping it up until theallies had rushed into the house and were about to take us.I had a moment of vacillation. She whispered that there was no way to changedirections, and that we had to finish what we had started. After untying hershawl from my waist, she rolled back to her spot and sat down.I put my left hand to my lips and tried to produce the tapping sound. I found itvery difficult at first. My lips were dry and my hands were sweaty, but after aninitial clumsiness, a feeling of vigor and well-being came over me. I producedthe most flawless tapping noise I had ever done. It reminded me of the tappingnoise I had been hearing all along as a response to mine. As soon as I stoppedto breathe, I could hear the tapping sound being answered from all directions.La Gorda signaled me to go on with it. I produced three more series. The lastone was utterly mesmeric. I did not need to intake a gulp of air and let it outin small spurts, as I had been doing all along. This time the tapping sound cameout of my mouth freely. I did not even have to use the edge of my hand toproduce it.La Gorda suddenly rushed to me, lifted me up bodily by my armpits and pushed meto the middle of the room. Her action disrupted my absolute concentration. Inoticed that Lidia was holding onto my right arm, Josefina to my left, and Rosahad backed up against the front of me and was holding me by the waist with herarms extended backward. La Gorda was in back of me. She ordered me to put myarms behind and grab onto her shawl, which she had looped around her neck andshoulders like a harness.I noticed at that moment that something besides us was there in the room, but Icould not tell what it was. The little sisters were shivering. I knew that theywere aware of something which I was unable to distinguish. I also knew that laGorda was going to try to do what she had done in don Genaro's house. All of asudden, I felt the wind of the eye-door pulling us. I grabbed onto la Gorda'sshawl with all my strength while the little sisters grabbed onto me. I felt thatwe were spinning, tumbling and swaying from side to side like a giant,weightless leaf.I opened my eyes and saw that we were like a bundle. We were either standing upor we were lying horizontally in the air. I could not tell which because I hadno sensorial point of reference. Then, as suddenly as we had been lifted off, wewere dropped. I sensed our falling in my midsection. I yelled with pain and myscreams were united with those of the little sisters. The insides of my kneeshurt. I felt an unbearable jolt on my legs; I thought I must have broken them.My next impression was that something was getting inside my nose. It was verydark and I was lying on my back. I sat up. I realized then that la Gorda wastickling my nostrils with a twig.I did not feel exhausted or even mildly tired. I jumped to my feet and only thenwas I stricken by the realization that we were not in the house. We were on ahill, a rocky, barren hill. I took a step and nearly fell down. I had stumbledover a body. It was Josefina. She was extremely hot to the touch. She seemed tobe feverish. I tried to make her sit up, but she was limp. Rosa was next to her.As a contrast, her body was icy cold. I put one on top of the other and rockedthem. That motion brought them back to their senses.La Gorda had found Lidia and was making her walk. After a few minutes, all of uswere standing. We were perhaps half a mile east of the house. Years before don Juan had produced in me a similar experience, but with the aidof a psychotropic plant. He seemingly made me fly and I landed a distance fromhis house.At the time, I had tried to explain the event in rational terms, but there wasno ground for rational explanations, and, short of accepting that I had flown, Ihad to fall back onto the only two avenues left open:...I could explain it all by arguing that don Juan had transported me to thedistant field while I was still unconscious under the effect of the psychotropicalkaloids of that plant;...Or I could argue that under the influence of the alkaloids, I had believedwhat don Juan was ordering me to believe that I was flying. This time I had no other recourse but to brace myself for accepting, on its facevalue, that I had flown. I wanted to indulge in doubts and began to wonder aboutthe possibilities of the four girls carrying me to that hill.I laughed loudly, incapable of containing an obscure delight. I was having arelapse of my old malady. My reason, which had been blocked off temporarily, wasbeginning to take hold of me again. I wanted to defend it. Or perhaps it wouldbe more appropriate to say, in light of the outlandish acts I had witnessed andperformed since my arrival, that my reason was defending itself, independentlyof the more complex whole that seemed to be the \"me\" I did not know. I waswitnessing, almost in the fashion of an interested observer, how my reasonstruggled to find suitable rationales, while another much larger portion of mecould not have cared less about explaining anything.La Gorda made the three girls line up. She then pulled me to her side. All ofthem folded their arms behind their backs. La Gorda made me do the same. Shestretched my arms as far back as they would go and then made me bend them andgrab each forearm as tightly as possible as close to the elbows as I could. Thatcreated a great muscular pressure at the articulations of my shoulders. Shepushed my trunk forward until I was almost stooping. Then she made a peculiarbirdcall. That was a signal. Lidia started walking. In the darkness hermovements reminded me of an ice skater. She walked swiftly and silently and in afew minutes she disappeared from my view.La Gorda made two more birdcalls, one after the other, and Rosa and Josefinatook off in the same manner Lidia had. La Gorda told me to follow close to her.She made one more birdcall and we both started walking.I was surprised at the ease with which I walked. My entire balance was centeredin my legs. The fact that I had my arms behind my back, instead of hindering mymovements, aided me in maintaining a strange equilibrium. But above all whatsurprised me the most was the quietness of my steps.When we reached the road we began to walk normally. We passed two men going inthe opposite direction. La Gorda greeted them and they answered back. When wearrived at the house we found the little sisters standing by the door, notdaring to go in.La Gorda told them that although I could not control the allies I could eithercall them or tell them to leave, and that the allies would not bother us anylonger. The girls believed her; something I myself could not do in thatinstance.We went inside. In a very quiet and efficient manner all of them undressed,drenched themselves with cold water and put on a fresh change of clothes. I didthe same. I put on the old clothes I used to keep in don Juan's house; which laGorda brought to me in a box.All of us were in high spirits. I asked la Gorda to explain to me what we haddone.\"We'll talk about that later,\" she said in a firm tone.I remembered then that the packages I had for them were still in the car. Ithought that while la Gorda was cooking some food for us it would be a goodopportunity to distribute them. I went out and got them and brought them intothe house. I placed them on the table.Lidia asked me if I had already assigned the gifts as she had suggested. I saidthat I wanted them to pick one they liked. She declined. She said that no doubtI had something special for Pablito and Nestor and a bunch of trinkets for them,which I would throw on the table with the intention that they fight over them.\"Besides, you didn't bring anything for Benigno,\" Lidia said as she came to myside and looked at me with mock seriousness. \"You can't hurt the Genaros'feelings by giving two gifts for three.\"They all laughed. I felt embarrassed. She was absolutely right in everythingthat she had said.\"You are careless. That's why I've never liked you,\" Lidia said to me, changingher smile into a frown. \"You have never greeted me with affection or respect.Every time we saw each other you only pretended to be happy to see me.\"She imitated my obviously contrived effusive greeting, a greeting I must havegiven her countless times in the past.\"Why didn't you ever ask me what I was doing here?\" Lidia asked me.I stopped writing to consider her point. It had never occurred to me to ask heranything. I told her that I had no excuse.La Gorda interceded and said that the reason that I had never said more than twowords to either Lidia or Rosa each time I saw them was because I was accustomedto talking only to women that I was enamored of, in one way or another. La Gordaadded that the Nagual had told them that if I would ask them anything directlythey were supposed to answer my questions, but as long as I did not ask, theywere not supposed to mention anything.Rosa said that she did not like me because I was always laughing and trying tobe funny.Josefina added that since I had never seen her, she disliked me just for fun;for the hell of it.\"I want you to know that I don't accept you as the Nagual,\" Lidia said to me.\"You're too dumb. You know nothing. I know more than you do. How can I respectyou?\"Lidia added that as far as she was concerned I could go back where I came from,or go jump in a lake for that matter.Rosa and Josefina did not say a word. Judging by the serious and meanexpressions on their faces, however, they seemed to agree with Lidia.\"How can this man lead us?\" Lidia asked la Gorda. \"He's not a true nagual. He'sa man. He's going to make us into idiots like himself.\"As she was talking I could see the mean expressions on Rosa's and Josefina'sfaces getting even harder.La Gorda intervened and explained to them what she had seen earlier about me.She added that since she had recommended to me not to get entangled in theirwebs, she was recommending the same thing to them; not to get entangled in mine.After Lidia's initial display of genuine and well-founded animosity, I wasflabbergasted to see how easily she acquiesced to la Gorda's remarks. She smiledat me. She even came and sat next to me.\"You're really like us, eh?\" she asked in a tone of bewilderment.I did not know what to say. I was afraid of blundering.Lidia was obviously the leader of the little sisters. The moment she smiled atme the other two seemed to be infused instantly with the same mood.La Gorda told them not to mind my pencil and paper and my asking questions, andthat in return I would not be flustered when they became involved in doing whatthey loved the most; to indulge in themselves.The three of them sat close to me. La Gorda walked over to the table, got thepackages and took them out to my car. I asked Lidia to forgive me for myinexcusable blunderings of the past and asked all of them to tell me how theyhad become don Juan's apprentices.In order to make them feel at ease I gave them an account of how I had met donJuan. Their accounts were the same as what dona Soledad had already told me.Lidia said that all of them had been free to leave don Juan's world, but theirchoice had been to stay. She in particular, being the first apprentice, wasgiven an opportunity to go away. After the Nagual and Genaro had cured her, theNagual had pointed to the door and told her that if she did not go through itthen, the door would close her in and would never open again.\"My fate was sealed when that door closed,\" Lidia said to me. \"Just like whathappened to you. The Nagual told me that after he had put a patch on you, youhad a chance to leave but you didn't want to take it.\"I remembered that particular decision more vividly than anything else. Irecounted to them how don Juan had tricked me into believing that a sorceresswas after him, and then he gave me the choice of either leaving for good orstaying to help him wage a war against his attacker. It turned out that hisalleged attacker was one of his confederates. By confronting her on what Ithought was don Juan's behalf, I turned her against me and she became what hecalled my 'worthy opponent'.I asked Lidia if they had had a worthy opponent themselves.\"We are not as dumb as you are,\" she said. \"We never needed anyone to spur us.\"\"Pablito is that dumb,\" Rosa said. \"Soledad is his opponent. I don't know howworthy she is, though. But as the saying goes: 'If you can't feed on a capon,feed on an onion'.\" [* capon- flesh of a castrated male chicken]They laughed and banged on the table.I asked them if any of them knew the sorceress don Juan had pitted me against,la Catalina.They shook their heads negatively.\"I know her,\" la Gorda said from the stove. \"She's from the Nagual's cycle, butshe looks as if she's thirty.\"\"What is a cycle, Gorda?\" I asked.She walked over to the table and put her foot on the bench and rested her chinon her arm and knee.\"Sorcerers like the Nagual and Genaro have two cycles,\" she said. \"The first iswhen they're human, like ourselves. We are in our first cycle. Each of us hasbeen given a task and that task is making us leave the human form. Eligio, thefive of us, and the Genaros are of the same cycle.\"The second cycle is when a sorcerer is not human anymore, like the Nagual andGenaro. They came to teach us, and after they taught us they left. We are thesecond cycle to them.\"The Nagual and la Catalina are like you and Lidia. They are in the samepositions. She's a scary sorceress, just like Lidia.\"La Gorda went back to the stove. The little sisters seemed nervous.\"That must be the woman who knows power plants,\" Lidia said to la Gorda.La Gorda said that she was the one. I asked them if the Nagual had ever giventhem power plants.\"No, not to us three,\" Lidia replied. \"Power plants are given only to emptypeople. Like yourself and la Gorda.\"\"Did the Nagual give you power plants, Gorda?\" I asked loudly.La Gorda raised two fingers over her head.\"The Nagual gave her his pipe twice,\" Lidia said. \"And she went off her rockerboth times.\"\"What happened, Gorda?\" I asked.\"I went off my rocker,\" she said as she walked over to the table. \"Power plantswere given to use because the Nagual was putting a patch on our bodies. Minehooked fast, but yours was difficult. The Nagual said that you were crazier thanJosefina, and impossible like Lidia, and he had to give you a lot of them.\"La Gorda explained that power plants were used only by sorcerers who hadmastered their art. Those plants were such a powerful affair that in order to beproperly handled, the most impeccable attention was needed on the part of thesorcerer. It took a lifetime to train one's attention to the degree needed.La Gorda said that complete people do not need power plants, and that neitherthe little sisters nor the Genaros had ever taken them, but that someday whenthey had perfected their art as dreamers, they would use them to get a final andtotal boost, a boost of such magnitude that it would be impossible for us tounderstand.\"Would you and I take them too?\" I asked la Gorda.\"All of us,\" she replied. \"The Nagual said that you should understand this pointbetter than any of us.\"I considered the issue for a moment. The effect of psychotropic plants hadindeed been terrifying for me. They seemed to reach a vast reservoir in me, andextract from it a total world.The drawback in taking them had been the toll they took on my physicalwell-being and the impossibility of controlling their effect. The world theyplunged me into was unamenable and chaotic. I lacked the control, the power, indon Juan's terms, to make use of such a world. If I would have the control,however, the possibilities would be staggering to the mind.\"I took them, myself,\" Josefina said all of a sudden. \"When I was crazy theNagual gave me his pipe, to cure me or kill me. And it cured me! \"\"The Nagual really gave Josefina his smoke,\" la Gorda said from the stove andthen came over to the table. \"He knew that she was pretending to be crazier thanshe was. She's always been a bit off, and she's very daring and indulges inherself like no one else.\"She always wanted to live where nobody would bother her and she could dowhatever she wanted. So the Nagual gave her his smoke and took her to live in aworld of her liking for fourteen days, until she was so bored with it that shegot cured. She cut her indulging. That was her cure.\"La Gorda went back to the stove. The little sisters laughed and patted oneanother on the back.I remembered then that at dona Soledad's house Lidia had not only intimated thatdon Juan had left a package for me but she had actually shown me a bundle thathad made me think of the sheath in which don Juan used to keep his pipe. Ireminded Lidia that she had said that they would give me that package when laGorda was present.The little sisters looked at one another and then turned to la Gorda. She made agesture with her head. Josefina stood up and went to the front room. Shereturned a moment later with the bundle that Lidia had shown me.I had a pang of anticipation in the pit of my stomach. Josefina carefully placedthe bundle on the table in front of me. All of them gathered around. She beganto untie it as ceremoniously as Lidia had done the first time. When the packagewas completely unwrapped, she spilled the contents on the table. They weremenstruation rags.I got flustered for an instant. But the sound of la Gorda's laughter, which waslouder than the others', was so pleasing that I had to laugh myself.\"That's Josefina's personal bundle,\" la Gorda said. \"It was her brilliant ideato play on your greed for a gift from the Nagual, in order to make you stay.\"\"You have to admit that it was a good idea,\" Lidia said to me.She imitated the look of greed I had on my face when she was opening the packageand then my look of disappointment when she did not finish.I told Josefina that her idea had indeed been brilliant; that it had worked asshe had anticipated, and that I had wanted that package more than I would careto admit.\"You can have it, if you want it,\" Josefina said and made everybody laugh.La Gorda said that the Nagual had known from the beginning that Josefina was notreally ill, and that that was the reason it had been so difficult for him tocure her. People who are actually sick are more pliable. Josefina was too awareof everything and very unruly and he had had to smoke her a great many times.Don Juan had once said the same thing about me, that he had smoked me. I hadalways believed that he was referring to having used psychotropic mushrooms tohave a view of me.\"How did he smoke you?\" I asked Josefina.She shrugged her shoulders and did not answer.\"The same way he smoked you,\" Lidia said. \"He pulled your luminosity and driedit with the smoke from a fire that he had made.\"I was sure that don Juan had never explained such a thing to me. I asked Lidiato tell me what she knew about the subject. She turned to la Gorda.\"Smoke is very important for sorcerers,\" la Gorda said. \"Smoke is like fog. Fogis of course better, but it's too hard to handle. It's not as handy as smoke is.\"So if a sorcerer wants to see and know someone who is always hiding- like youand Josefina- who are capricious and difficult; the sorcerer makes a fire andlets the smoke envelop the person. Whatever they're hiding comes out in thesmoke.\"La Gorda said that the Nagual used smoke not only to see and know people, butalso to cure. He gave Josefina smoke baths. He made her stand or sit by the firein the direction the wind was blowing. The smoke would envelop her and make herchoke and cry, but her discomfort was only temporary and of no consequence. Thepositive effects, on the other hand, were a gradual cleansing of the luminosity.\"The Nagual gave all of us smoke baths,\" la Gorda said. \"He gave you even morebaths than Josefina. He said that you were unbearable, and you were not evenpretending like she was.\"It all became clear to me. She was right; don Juan had made me sit in front of afire hundreds of times. The smoke used to irritate my throat and eyes to such adegree that I dreaded to see him begin to gather dry twigs and branches. He saidthat I had to learn to control my breathing and feel the smoke while I kept myeyes closed; that way I could breathe without choking.La Gorda said that smoke had helped Josefina to be ethereal and very elusive,and that no doubt it had helped me to cure my madness, whatever it was.\"The Nagual said that smoke takes everything out of you,\" la Gorda went on. \"Itmakes you clear and direct.\"I asked her if she knew how to bring out with the smoke whatever a person washiding. She said that she could easily do it because of having lost her form,but that the little sisters and the Genaros, although they had seen the Nagualand Genaro do it scores of times, could not yet do it themselves.I was curious to know why don Juan had never mentioned the subject to me inspite of the fact that he had smoked me like dry fish hundreds of times.\"He did,\" la Gorda said with her usual conviction. \"The Nagual even taught youfog gazing. He told us that once you smoked a whole place in the mountains andsaw what was hiding behind the scenery. He said that he was spellbound himself.\"I remembered an exquisite perceptual distortion- a hallucination of sorts- whichI had had, and thought was the product of a play between a most dense fog and anelectrical storm that were occurring at the same time.I narrated to them the episode and added that don Juan had never really directlytaught me anything about the fog or the smoke. His procedure had been to buildfires or to take me into fog banks.La Gorda did not say a word. She stood up and went back to the stove. Lidiashook her head and clicked her tongue.\"You sure are dumb,\" she said. \"The Nagual taught you everything. How do youthink you saw what you have just told us about?\"There was an abyss between our understanding of how to teach something. I toldthem that if I were to teach them something I knew, such as how to drive a car,I would go step by step, making sure that they understood every facet of thewhole procedure.La Gorda returned to the table, and said, \"That's only if the sorcerer isteaching something about the tonal.\"When the sorcerer is dealing with the nagual, the instruction he must give isto show the mystery to the warrior.\"...And that's all he has to do.\"The warrior who receives the mysteries must claim knowledge as power, by doingwhat he has been shown.\"The Nagual showed you more mysteries than all of us together. But you're lazy,like Pablito, and prefer to be confused. The tonal and the nagual are twodifferent worlds. In one you talk, in the other you act.\"At the moment she spoke, her words made absolute sense to me. I knew what shewas talking about. She went back to the stove, stirred something in a pot andcame back again.\"Why are you so dumb?\" Lidia bluntly asked me.\"He's empty,\" Rosa replied.They made me stand up and forced themselves to squint as they scanned my bodywith their eyes. All of them touched my umbilical region.\"But why are you still empty?\" Lidia asked.\"You know what to do, don't you?\" Rosa added.\"He was crazy,\" Josefina said to them. \"He must still be crazy now.\"La Gorda came to my aid and told them that I was still empty for the same reasonthey still had their form. All of us secretly did not want the world of thenagual. We were afraid and had second thoughts. In short, none of us was betterthan Pablito.They did not say a word. All three of them seemed thoroughly embarrassed.\"Poor little Nagual,\" Lidia said to me with a tone of genuine concern. \"You'reas scared as we are. I pretend to be tough, Josefina pretends to be crazy, Rosapretends to be ill-tempered and you pretend to be dumb.\"They laughed, and for the first time since I had arrived they made a gesture ofcomradeship toward me. They embraced me and put their heads against mine.La Gorda sat facing me and the little sisters sat around her. I was facing allfour of them.\"Now we can talk about what happened tonight,\" la Gorda said. \"The Nagual toldme that if we survived the last contact with the allies we wouldn't be the same.The allies did something to us tonight. They have hurled us away.\"She gently touched my writing hand.\"Tonight was a special night for you,\" she went on. \"Tonight all of us pitchedin to help you, including the allies. The Nagual would have liked it. Tonightyou saw all the way through.\"\"I did?\" I asked.\"There you go again,\" Lidia said, and everybody laughed.\"Tell me about my seeing, Gorda,\" I insisted. \"You know that I'm dumb. Thereshould be no misunderstandings between us.\"\"All right,\" she said. \"I see what you mean. Tonight you saw the littlesisters.\"I said to them that I had also witnessed incredible acts performed by don Juanand don Genaro. I had seen them as plainly as I had seen the little sisters andyet don Juan and don Genaro had always concluded that I had not seen. I failed,therefore, to determine in what way could the acts of the little sisters bedifferent.\"You mean you didn't see how they were holding onto the lines of the world?\" Sheasked.\"No, I didn't.\"\"You didn't see them slipping through the crack between the worlds?\"I narrated to them what I had witnessed. They listened in silence. At the end ofmy account la Gorda seemed to be on the verge of tears.\"What a pity! \" she exclaimed.She stood up and walked around the table and embraced me. Her eyes were clearand restful. I knew she bore no malice toward me.\"It's our fate that you are plugged up like this,\" she said. \"But you're stillthe Nagual to us. I won't hinder you with ugly thoughts. You can at least beassured of that.\"I knew that she meant it. She was speaking to me from a level that I hadwitnessed only in don Juan. She had repeatedly explained her mood as the productof having lost her human form. She was indeed a formless warrior. A wave ofprofound affection for her enveloped me. I was about to weep.It was at the instant that I felt she was a most marvelous warrior that quite anintriguing thing happened to me.The closest way of describing it would be to say that I felt that my ears hadsuddenly popped. Except that I felt the popping in the middle of my body, rightbelow my navel, more acutely than in my ears. Right after the popping everythingbecame clearer: sounds, sights, odors. Then I felt an intense buzzing, whichoddly enough did not interfere with my hearing capacity. The buzzing was loudbut did not drown out any other sounds. It was as if I were hearing the buzzingwith some part of me other than my ears. A hot flash went through my body. Andthen I suddenly recalled something I had never seen. It was as though an alienmemory had taken possession of me.I remembered Lidia pulling herself from two horizontal, reddish ropes as shewalked on the wall. She was not really walking. She was actually gliding on athick bundle of lines that she held with her feet. I remembered seeing herpanting with her mouth open, from the exertion of pulling the reddish ropes. Thereason I could not hold my balance at the end of her display was because I wasseeing her as a light that went around the room so fast that it made me dizzy.It pulled me from the area around my navel.I remembered Rosa's actions and Josefina's as well.Rosa had actually brachiated, [* brachiated- swung from one hold to the next]with her left arm holding onto long, vertical, reddish fibers that looked likevines dropping from the dark roof. With her right arm she was also holding somevertical fibers that seemed to give her stability. She also held onto the samefibers with her toes. Toward the end of her display she was like aphosphorescence on the roof. The lines of her body had been erased.Josefina was hiding herself behind some lines that seemed to come out of thefloor. What she was doing with her raised forearm was moving the lines togetherto give them the necessary width to conceal her bulk. Her puffed-up clothes werea great prop. They had somehow contracted her luminosity. The clothes were bulkyonly for the eye that looked. At the end of her display Josefina, like Lidia andRosa, was just a patch of light. I could switch from one recollection to theother in my mind.When I told them about my concurrent memories the little sisters looked at mebewildered. La Gorda was the only one who seemed to be following what washappening to me. She laughed with true delight and said that the Nagual wasright in saying that I was too lazy to remember what I had 'seen'. Therefore Ionly bothered with what I had looked at.Is it possible, I thought to myself, that I am unconsciously selecting what Irecall? Or is it la Gorda who is creating all this? If it was true that I hadselected my recall at first and then released what I had censored, then it alsohad to be true that I must have perceived much more of don Juan's and donGenaro's actions, and yet I could only recall a selective part of my totalperception of those events.\"It's hard to believe,\" I said to la Gorda, \"that I can remember now something Ididn't remember at all a while ago.\"\"The Nagual said that everyone can see, and yet we choose not to remember whatwe see,\" she said. \"Now I understand how right he was. All of us can see; someof us more than others.\"I told la Gorda that some part of me knew that I had found then a transcendentalkey. A missing piece had been handed down to me by all of them. But it wasdifficult to discern what it was.She announced that she had just 'seen' that I had practiced a good deal ofdreaming, and that I had developed my attention; and yet I was fooled by my ownappearance of not knowing anything.\"I've been trying to tell you about attention,\" she proceeded, \"but you know asmuch as we do about it.\"I assured her that my knowledge was intrinsically different from theirs. Theirswas infinitely more spectacular than mine. Anything they might say to me inrelation to their practices, therefore, was a bonus to me.\"The Nagual told us to show you that with our attention we can hold the imagesof a dream in the same way we hold the images of the world,\" la Gorda said. \"Theart of the dreamer is the art of attention.\"Thoughts came down on me like a landslide. I had to stand up and walk around thekitchen. I sat down again. We remained quiet for a long time. I knew what shehad meant when she said that the art of dreamers was the art of attention. Iknew then that don Juan had told me and showed me everything he could.I had not been able, however, to realize the premises of his knowledge in mybody while he was around. He had said that my reason was the demon that kept mechained, and that I had to vanquish it if I wanted to achieve the realization ofhis teachings. The issue, therefore, had been how to vanquish my reason. It hadnever occurred to me to press him for a definition of what he meant by reason. Ipresumed all along that he meant the capacity for comprehending, inferring orthinking, in an orderly, rational way. From what la Gorda had said, I knew thatto him reason meant attention.Don Juan said that the core of our being was the act of perceiving, and that themagic of our being was the act of awareness. For him perception and awarenesswere a single, functional, inextricable unit, a unit which had two domains.The first one was the \"attention of the tonal\"; that is to say, the capacity ofaverage people to perceive and place their awareness on the ordinary world ofeveryday life. Don Juan also called this form of attention our \"first ring ofpower,\" and described it as our awesome but taken-for-granted ability to impartorder to our perception of our daily world.The second domain was the \"attention of the nagual\"; that is to say, thecapacity of sorcerers to place their awareness on the nonordinary world. Hecalled this domain of attention the \"second ring of power,\" or the altogetherportentous ability that all of us have, but only sorcerers use, to impart orderto the nonordinary world.La Gorda and the little sisters, in demonstrating to me that the art of dreamerswas to hold the images of their dreams with their attention, had brought in thepragmatic aspect of don Juan's scheme. They were the practitioners who had gonebeyond the theoretical aspect of his teachings.In order to give me a demonstration of that art, they had to make use of their\"second ring of power,\" or the \"attention of the nagual.\" In order for me towitness their art, I had to do the same. In fact it was evident that I hadplaced my attention on both domains.Perhaps all of us are continually perceiving in both fashions but choose toisolate one for recollection and discard the other or perhaps we file it away,as I myself had done. Under certain conditions of stress or acquiescence, thecensored memory surfaces and we can then have two distinct memories of oneevent.What don Juan had struggled to vanquish, or rather suppress in me, was not my'reason' as the capacity for rational thought, but rather my 'attention of thetonal'; my awareness of the world of common sense.His motive for wanting me to do so was explained by la Gorda when she said thatthe daily world exists because we know how to hold its images. Consequently, ifone drops the attention needed to maintain those images, the world collapses.\"The Nagual told us that practice is what counts,\" la Gorda said suddenly. \"Onceyou get your attention on the images of your dream, your attention is hooked forgood. In the end you can be like Genaro, who could hold the images of anydream.\"\"We each have five other dreams,\" Lidia said. \"But we showed you the first onebecause that was the dream the Nagual gave us.\"\"Can all of you go into dreaming any time you want?\" I asked.\"No,\" la Gorda replied. \"Dreaming takes too much power. None of us has that muchpower. The reason the little sisters had to roll on the floor so many times wasthat in rolling the earth was giving them energy. Maybe you could also rememberseeing them as luminous beings getting energy from the light of the earth. TheNagual said that the best way of getting energy is, of course, to let the suninside the eyes, especially the left eye.\"I told her that I knew nothing about it, and she described a procedure that donJuan had taught them. As she spoke I remembered that don Juan had also taughtthe same procedure to me. It consisted in moving my head slowly from side toside as I caught the sunlight with my half-closed left eye. He said that onecould not only use the sun, but could use any kind of light that could shine onthe eyes.La Gorda said that the Nagual had recommended that they tie their shawls belowtheir waists in order to protect their hipbones when they rolled.I commented that don Juan had never mentioned rolling to me. She said that onlywomen could roll because they had wombs and energy came directly into theirwombs. By rolling around they distributed that energy over the rest of theirbodies. In order for a man to be energized he had to be on his back, with hisknees bent so that the soles of his feet touched each other. His arms had to beextended laterally, with his forearms raised vertically, and the fingers clawedin an upright position.\"We have been dreaming those dreams for years,\" Lidia said. \"Those dreams areour best, because our attention is complete. In the other dreams that we have,our attention is still shaky.\"La Gorda said that holding the images of dreams was a Toltec art. After years ofconsuming practice each one of them was able to perform one act in any dream.Lidia could walk on anything, Rosa could dangle from anything, Josefina couldhide behind anything, and she herself could fly. But they were only beginners;apprentices of the art. They had complete attention for only one activity.She added that Genaro was the master of dreaming and could turn the tablesaround and have attention for as many activities as we have in our daily life;and that for him the two domains of attention had the same value.I felt compelled to ask them my usual question. I had to know their procedures;how they held the images of their dreams.\"You know that as well as we do,\" la Gorda said. \"The only thing I can say isthat after going to the same dream over and over, we began to feel the lines ofthe world. They helped us to do what you saw us doing.\"Don Juan had said that our 'first ring of power' is engaged very early in ourlives and that we live under the impression that that is all there is to us. Our'second ring of power', the 'attention of the nagual', remains hidden for theimmense majority of us, and only at the moment of our death is it revealed tous.There is a pathway to reach it, however, which is available to every one of us,but which only sorcerers take, and that pathway is through 'dreaming'. Dreamingwas in essence the transformation of ordinary dreams into affairs involvingvolition. Dreamers, by engaging their 'attention of the nagual' and focusing iton the items and events of their ordinary dreams, change those dreams intodreaming.Don Juan said that there were no procedures to arrive at the attention of thenagual. He only gave me pointers. Finding my hands in my dreams was the firstpointer. Then the exercise of paying attention was elongated to finding objects;looking for specific features, such as buildings, streets and so on.From there the jump was to dreaming about specific places at specific times ofthe day.The final stage was drawing the 'attention of the nagual' to focus on the totalself. Don Juan said that that final stage was usually ushered in by a dream thatmany of us have had at one time or another, in which one is looking at oneselfsleeping in bed.By the time a sorcerer has such a dream, his attention has been developed tosuch a degree that instead of waking himself up- as most of us would do in thatsituation- he turns on his heels and engages himself in activity; as if he wereacting in the world of everyday life.From that moment on there is a breakage; a division of sorts in the otherwiseunified personality. The result of engaging the 'attention of the nagual' indreaming, and developing it to the height and sophistication of our 'dailyattention of the world' was, in don Juan's scheme, 'the other' self; anidentical being as oneself, but made in 'dreaming'.Don Juan had told me that there are no definite standard steps for reaching thatdouble, as there are no definite steps for us to reach our daily awareness. Wesimply do it by practicing. He contended that in the act of engaging ourattention of the nagual, we would find the steps. He urged me to practicedreaming without letting my fears make it into an encumbering production.He had done the same with la Gorda and the little sisters, but obviouslysomething in them had made them more receptive to the idea of another level ofattention.\"Genaro was in his body of dreaming most of the time,\" la Gorda said. \"He likedit better. That's why he could do the weirdest things and scare you half todeath. Genaro could go in and out of the crack between the worlds like you and Ican go in and out a door.\"Don Juan had also talked to me at great length about the crack between theworlds. I had always believed that he was talking in a metaphorical sense abouta subtle division between the world that the average man perceives and the worldthat sorcerers perceive.La Gorda and the little sisters had shown me that the crack between the worldswas more than a metaphor. It was rather the capacity to change levels ofattention. One part of me understood la Gorda perfectly while another part of mewas more frightened than ever.\"You have been asking where the Nagual and Genaro went,\" la Gorda said. \"Soledadwas very blunt and told you that they went to the other world; Lidia told youthey left this area; the Genaros were stupid and scared you. The truth is thatthe Nagual and Genaro went through that crack.\"For some reason undefinable to me, her statements plunged me into profoundchaos. I had felt all along that they had left for good. I knew that they hadnot left in an ordinary sense, but I had kept that feeling in the realm of ametaphor. Although I had even voiced it to close friends, I think I never reallybelieved it myself. In the depths of me I had always been a rational man. But laGorda and the little sisters had turned my obscure metaphors into realpossibilities. La Gorda had actually transported us half a mile with the energyof her dreaming.La Gorda stood up and said that I had understood everything, and that it wastime for us to eat. She served us the food that she had cooked. I did not feellike eating. At the end of the meal she stood up and came to my side.\"I think it's time for you to leave,\" she said to me.That seemed to be a cue for the little sisters. They also stood up.\"If you stay beyond this moment, you won't be able to leave anymore,\" la Gordawent on. \"The Nagual gave you freedom once, but you chose to stay with him. Hetold me that if we all survive the last contact with the allies I should feedall of you, make you feel good and then say good-bye to all of you. I figurethat the little sisters and I have no place to go, so there is no choice for us.But you are different.\"The little sisters surrounded me and each said good-bye to me.There was a monstrous irony in that situation. I was free to leave but I had noplace to go. There was no choice for me either. Years before don Juan gave me a chance to back out. I stayed then because Ialready had no place to go.\"We choose only once,\" he had said then. \"We choose either to be warriors or tobe ordinary men. A second choice does not exist. Not on this earth.\" ================================================================"},{"pageContent":"6. The Second Attention \"You have to leave later on today,\" la Gorda said to me right after breakfast.\"Since you have decided to go with us, you have committed yourself to helping usfulfill our new task. The Nagual left me in charge only until you came. Heentrusted me, as you already know, with certain things to tell you.\"I've told you most of them. But there are still some I couldn't mention to youuntil you made your choice. Today we will take care of them. Right after thatyou must leave in order to give us time to get ready. We need a few days tosettle everything and to prepare to leave these mountains forever. We have beenhere a very long time. It's hard to break away. But everything has come to asudden end. The Nagual warned us of the total change that you would bringregardless of the outcome of your bouts, but I think no one really believedhim.\"\"I fail to see why you have to change anything,\" I said.\"I've explained it to you already,\" she protested. \"We have lost our oldpurpose. Now we have a new one and that new purpose requires that we become aslight as the breeze. The breeze is our new mood. It used to be the hot wind. Youhave changed our direction.\"\"You are talking in circles, Gorda.\"\"Yes, but that's because you're empty. I can't make it any clearer. When youreturn, the Genaros will show you the art of the stalker, and right after thatall of us will leave. The Nagual said that if you decide to be with us the firstthing I should tell you is that you have to remember your bouts with Soledad andthe little sisters, and examine every single thing that happened to you withthembecause everything is an omen of what will happen to you on your path. Ifyou are careful and impeccable, you'll find that those bouts were gifts ofpower.\"\"What's dona Soledad going to do now?\"\"She's leaving. The little sisters have already helped her to take her floorapart. That floor aided her to reach her attention of the nagual. The lines hadpower to do that. Each of them helped her gather a piece of that attention. Tobe incomplete is no handicap to reaching that attention for some warriors.Soledad was transformed because she got to that attention faster than any of us.She doesn't have to gaze at her floor anymore to go into that other world, andnow that there is no more need for the floor. She has returned it to the earthwhere she got it.\"\"You are really determined to leave, Gorda, aren't you?\"\"All of us are. That's why I'm asking you to go away for a few days to give ustime to pull down everything we have.\"\"Am I the one who has to find a place for all of you, Gorda?\"\"If you were an impeccable warrior you would do just that. But you're not animpeccable warrior, and neither are we. But still we will have to do our best tomeet our new challenge.\"I felt an oppressive sense of doom. I have never been one to thrive onresponsibilities. I thought that the commitment to guide them was a crushingburden that I could not handle.\"Maybe we don't have to do anything,\" I said.\"Yes. That's right,\" she said, and laughed. \"Why don't you tell yourself thatover and over until you feel safe? The Nagual told you time and time again thatthe only freedom warriors have is to behave impeccably.\"She told me how the Nagual had insisted that all of them understand that notonly was impeccability freedom, but it was the only way to scare away the humanform.I narrated to her the way don Juan made me understand what was meant byimpeccability. He and I were hiking one day through a very steep ravine when ahuge boulder got loose from its matrix on the rock wall and came down with aformidable force and landed on the floor of the canyon, twenty or thirty yardsfrom where we were standing. The size of the boulder made its fall a veryimpressive event.Don Juan seized the opportunity to create a dramatic lesson. He said that theforce that rules our destinies is outside of ourselves and has nothing to dowith our acts or volition. Sometimes that force would make us stop walking onour way and bend over to tie our shoelaces, as I had just done. And by making usstop, that force makes us gain a precious moment. If we had kept on walking,that enormous boulder would have most certainly crushed us to death.Some other day, however, in another ravine the same outside deciding force wouldmake us stop again to bend over and tie our shoelaces while another boulderwould get loose precisely above where we are standing. By making us stop, thatforce would have made us lose a precious moment. That time if we had kept onwalking, we would have saved ourselves. Don Juan said that in view of my totallack of control over the forces which decide my destiny, my only possiblefreedom in that ravine consisted in my tying my shoelaces impeccably.La Gorda seemed to be moved by my account. For an instant she held my face inher hands from across the table.\"Impeccability for me is to tell you at the right time what the Nagual told meto tell you,\" she said. \"But power has to time perfectly what I have to revealto you, or it won't have any effect.\"She paused in a dramatic fashion. Her delay was very studied but terriblyeffective with me.\"What is it?\" I asked desperately.She did not answer. She took me by the arm and led me to the area just outsidethe front door. She made me sit on the hard-packed ground with my back against athick pole about one and a half feet high that looked like a tree stump whichhad been planted in the ground almost against the wall of the house. There was arow of five such poles planted about two feet apart. I had meant to ask la Gordawhat their function was. My first impression had been that a former owner of thehouse had tied animals to them. My conjecture seemed incongruous, however,because the area just outside the front door was a kind of roofed porch.I told la Gorda my supposition as she sat down next to me to my left with herback against another pole. She laughed and said that the poles were indeed usedfor tying animals of sorts, but not by a former owner, and that she had nearlybroken her back digging the holes for them.\"What do you use them for?\" I asked.\"Let's say that we tie ourselves to them,\" she replied. \"And this brings me tothe next thing the Nagual asked me to tell you. He said that because you wereempty, he had to gather your second attention, your attention of the nagual, ina way different than ours.We gathered that attention through dreaming and you did it with his powerplants. The Nagual said that his power plants gathered the menacing side of yoursecond attention in one clump, and that's the shape that came out of your head.He said that that's what happens to sorcerers when they are given power plants.If they don't die, the power plants spin their second attention into that awfulshape that comes out of their heads.\"Now we're coming to what he wanted you to do. He said that you must changedirections now and begin gathering your second attention in another way; morelike us. You can't keep on the path of knowledge unless you balance your secondattention. So far, that attention of yours has been riding on the Nagual'spower, but now you are alone. That's what he wanted me to tell you.\"\"How do I balance my second attention?\"\"You have to do dreaming the way we do it. Dreaming is the only way to gatherthe second attention without injuring it; without making it menacing andawesome. Your second attention is fixed on the awful side of the world. Ours ison the beauty of it. You have to change sides and come with us. That's what youchose last night when you decided to go with us.\"\"Could that shape come out of me at any time?\"\"No. The Nagual said that it won't come out again until you're as old as he is.Your nagual has already come out as many times as was needed. The Nagual andGenaro have seen to that. They used to tease it out of you. The Nagual told methat sometimes you were a hair away from dying because your second attention isvery indulging.\"He said that once you even scared him. Your nagual attacked him and he had tosing to it to calm it down. But the worst thing happened to you in Mexico City.There he pushed you one day and you went into an office and in that office youwent through the crack between the worlds. He intended only to dispel yourattention of the tonal. You were worried sick over some stupid thing.\"But when he shoved you, your whole tonal shrunk and your entire being wentthrough the crack. He had a hellish time finding you. He told me that for amoment he thought you had gone farther than he could reach. But then he saw youroaming around aimlessly and he brought you back. He told me that you wentthrough the crack around ten in the morning. So, on that day, ten in the morningbecame your new time.\"\"My new time for what?\"\"For everything. If you remain a man you will die around that time. If youbecome a sorcerer you will leave this world around that time.\"Eligio also went on a different path; a path none of us knew about. We met himjust before he left. Eligio was a most marvelous dreamer. He was so good thatthe Nagual and Genaro used to take him through the crack, and he had the powerto withstand it as if it were nothing. He didn't even pant. The Nagual andGenaro gave him a final boost with power plants. He had the control and thepower to handle that boost. And that's what sent him to wherever he is.\"\"The Genaros told me that Eligio jumped with Benigno. Is that true?\"\"Sure. By the time Eligio had to jump, his second attention had already been inthat other world. The Nagual said that yours had also been there, but that foryou it was a nightmare because you had no control. He said that his power plantshad made you lopsided. They had made you cut through your attention of the tonaland had put you directly in the realm of your second attention, but without anymastery over that attention. The Nagual didn't give power plants to Eligio untilthe very last.\"\"Do you think that my second attention has been injured, Gorda?\"\"The Nagual never said that. He thought you were dangerously crazy, but that hasnothing to do with power plants. He said that both of your attentions areunmanageable. If you could conquer them you'd be a great warrior.\"I wanted her to tell me more on the subject. She put her hand on my writing padand said that we had a terribly busy day ahead of us and we needed to storeenergy in order to withstand it. We had, therefore, to energize ourselves withthe sunlight. She said that the circumstances required that we take the sunlightwith the left eye. She began to move her head slowly from side to side as sheglanced directly into the sun through her half closed eyes.A moment later Lidia, Rosa and Josefina joined us. Lidia sat to my right,Josefina sat next to her, while Rosa sat next to la Gorda. All of them wereresting their backs against the poles. I was in the middle of the row.It was a clear day. The sun was just above the distant range of mountains. Theystarted moving their heads in perfect synchronization. I joined them and had thefeeling that I too had synchronized my motion with theirs. They kept it up forabout a minute and then stopped.All of them wore hats and used the brims to protect their faces from thesunlight when they were not bathing their eyes in it. La Gorda had given me myold hat to wear.We sat there for about half an hour. In that time we repeated the exercisecountless times. I intended to make a mark on my pad for each time but la Gordavery casually pushed my pad out of reach.Lidia suddenly stood up, mumbling something unintelligible. La Gorda leaned overto me and whispered that the Genaros were coming up the road. I strained to lookbut there was no one in sight. Rosa and Josefina also stood up and then wentwith Lidia inside the house.I told la Gorda that I could not see anyone approaching. She replied that theGenaros had been visible at one point on the road and added that she had dreadedthe moment when all of us would have to get together, but that she was confidentthat I could handle the situation. She advised me to be extra careful withJosefina and Pablito because they had no control over themselves. She said thatthe most sensible thing for me to do would be to take the Genaros away after anhour or so.I kept looking at the road. There was no sign of anyone approaching.\"Are you sure they're coming?\" I asked.She said that she had not seen them but that Lidia had. The Genaros had beenvisible just for Lidia because she had been gazing at the same time she had beenbathing her eyes. I was not sure what la Gorda had meant and asked her toexplain.\"We are gazers,\" she said. \"Just like you. We are all the same. There is no needto deny that you're a gazer. The Nagual told us about your great feats ofgazing.\"\"My great feats of gazing! What are you talking about, Gorda?\"She contracted her mouth and appeared to be on the verge of being irritated bymy question; She seemed to catch herself. She smiled and gave me a gentle shove.At that moment she had a sudden flutter in her body. She stared blankly past me,then she shook her head vigorously. She said that she had just seen that theGenaros were not coming after all. It was too early for them. They were going towait for a while before they made their appearance. She smiled as if she weredelighted with the delay.\"It's too early for us to have them here anyway,\" she said. \"And they feel thesame way about us.\"\"Where are they now?\" I asked.\"They must be sitting beside the road somewhere,\" she replied. \"Benigno had nodoubt gazed at the house as they were walking and saw us sitting here and that'swhy they have decided to wait. That's perfect. That will give us time.\"\"You scare me, Gorda. Time for what?\"\"You have to round up your second attention today, just for us four.\"\"How can I do that?\"\"I don't know. You are very mysterious to us. The Nagual has done scores ofthings to you with his power plants, but you can't claim that as knowledge. Thatis what I've been trying to tell you. Only if you have mastery over your secondattention can you perform with it. Otherwise you'll always stay fixed halfwaybetween the two as you are now.Everything that has happened to you since you arrived has been directed to forcethat attention to spin. I've been giving you instructions little by little, justas the Nagual told me to do. Since you took another path, you don't know thethings that we know, just like we don't know anything about power plants.Soledad knows a bit more, because the Nagual took her to his homeland. Nestorknows about medicinal plants, but none of us has been taught the way you were.We don't need your knowledge yet. But someday when we are ready you are the onewho will know what to do to give us a boost with power plants. I am the only onewho knows where the Nagual's pipe is hidden, waiting for that day.\"The Nagual's command is that you have to change your path and go with us. Thatmeans that you have to do dreaming with us and stalking with the Genaros. Youcan't afford any longer to be where you are, on the awesome side of your secondattention. Another jolt of your nagual coming out of you could kill you. TheNagual told me that human beings are frail creatures composed of many layers ofluminosity. When you see them, they seem to have fibers, but those fibers arereally layers, like an onion. Jolts of any kind separate those layers and caneven cause human beings to die.\"She stood up and led me back to the kitchen. We sat down facing each other.Lidia, Rosa and Josefina were busy in the yard. I could not see them but I couldhear them talking and laughing.\"The Nagual said that we die because our layers become separated,\" la Gordasaid. \"Jolts are always separating them but they get together again. Sometimes,though, the jolt is so great that the layers get loose and can't get backtogether anymore.\"\"Have you ever seen the layers, Gorda?\"\"Sure. I saw a man dying in the street. The Nagual told me that you also found aman dying, but you didn't see his death. The Nagual made me see the dying man'slayers. They were like the peels of an onion. When human beings are healthy theyare like luminous eggs, but if they are injured they begin to peel, like anonion.\"The Nagual told me that your second attention was so strong sometimes that itpushed all the way out. He and Genaro had to hold your layers together otherwiseyou would've died. That's why he figured that you might have enough energy toget your nagual out of you twice. He meant that you could hold your layerstogether by yourself twice. You did it more times than that and now you arefinished. You have no more energy to hold your layers together in case ofanother jolt.\"The Nagual has entrusted me to take care of everyone. In your case, I have tohelp you to tighten your layers. The Nagual said that death pushes the layersapart. He explained to me that the center of our luminosity, which is theattention of the nagual, is always pushing out, and that's what loosens thelayers. So it's easy for death to come in between them and push them completelyapart. Sorcerers have to do their best to keep their own layers closed. That'swhy the Nagual taught us dreaming. Dreaming tightens the layers.\"When sorcerers learn dreaming they tie together their two attentions and thereis no more need for that center to push out.\"\"Do you mean that sorcerers do not die?\"\"That is right. Sorcerers do not die.\"\"Do you mean that none of us is going to die?\"\"I didn't mean us. We are nothing. We are freaks, neither here nor there. Imeant sorcerers. The Nagual and Genaro are sorcerers. Their two attentions areso tightly together that perhaps they'll never die.\"\"Did the Nagual say that, Gorda?\"\"Yes. He and Genaro both told me that. Not too long before they left, the Nagualexplained to us the power of attention. I never knew about the tonal and thenagual until then.\"La Gorda recounted the way don Juan had instructed them about that crucialtonal-nagual dichotomy. She said that one day the Nagual had all of them gathertogether in order to take them for a long hike to a desolate, rocky valley inthe mountains.He made a large, heavy bundle with all kinds of items. He even put Pablito'sradio in it. He then gave the bundle to Josefina to carry and put a heavy tableon Pablito's shoulders and they all started hiking. He made all of them taketurns carrying the bundle and the table as they hiked nearly forty miles to thathigh, desolate place.When they arrived there, the Nagual made Pablito set the table in the verycenter of the valley. Then he asked Josefina to arrange the contents of thebundle on the table. When the table was filled, he explained to them thedifference between the tonal and the nagual in the same terms he had explainedit to me in a restaurant in Mexico City; except that in their case his examplewas infinitely more graphic.He told them that the tonal was the order that we are aware of in our dailyworld and also the personal order that we carry through life on our shoulders,like they had carried that table and the bundle. The personal tonal of each ofus was like the table in that valley, a tiny island filled with the things weare familiar with. The nagual, on the other hand, was the inexplicable sourcethat held that table in place and was like the vastness of that deserted valley.He told them that sorcerers were obligated to watch their tonals from a distancein order to have a better grasp of what was really around them. He made themwalk to a ridge from where they could view the whole area. From there the tablewas hardly visible. He then made them go back to the table and had them all loomover it in order to show that an average man does not have the grasp that asorcerer has because an average man is right on top of his table holding ontoevery item on it.He then made each of them, one at a time, casually look at the objects on thetable, and tested their recall by taking something and hiding it to see if theyhad been attentive. All of them passed the test with flying colors. He pointedout to them that their ability to remember so easily the items on that table wasdue to the fact that all of them had developed their attention of the tonal, ortheir attention over the table.He next asked them to look casually at everything that was on the groundunderneath the table, and tested their recall by removing the rocks, twigs orwhatever else was there. None of them could remember what they had seen underthe table.The Nagual then swept everything off the top of the table and made each of them,one at a time, lie across it on their stomachs and carefully examine the groundunderneath. He explained to them that for a sorcerer the nagual was the areajust underneath the table.Since it was unthinkable to tackle the immensity of the nagual, as exemplifiedby that vast desolate place, sorcerers took as their domain of activity the areadirectly below the island of the tonal, as graphically shown by what wasunderneath that table. That area was the domain of what he called the secondattention, or the attention of the nagual, or the attention under the table.That attention was reached only after warriors had swept the top of their tablesclean. He said that reaching the second attention made the two attentions into asingle unit, and that unit was the totality of oneself.La Gorda said that his demonstration was so clear to her that she understood atonce why the Nagual had made her clean her own life; or sweep her 'island of thetonal', as he had called it. She felt that she had indeed been fortunate inhaving followed every suggestion that he had put to her. She was still a longway from unifying her two attentions, but her diligence had resulted in animpeccable life which was, as he had assured her, the only way for her to loseher human form. Losing the human form was the essential requirement for unifyingthe two attentions.\"The attention under the table is the key to everything sorcerers do,\" she wenton. \"In order for us to reach that attention, the Nagual and Genaro taught usdreaming; and you were taught about power plants. I don't know what they did toyou to teach you how to trap your second attention with power plants, but toteach us how to do dreaming the Nagual taught us gazing.\"He never told us what he was really doing to us. He just taught us to gaze. Wenever knew that gazing was the way to trap our second attention. We thoughtgazing was just for fun. That was not so. Dreamers have to be gazers before theycan trap their second attention.\"The first thing the Nagual did was to put a dry leaf on the ground and make melook at it for hours. Every day he brought a leaf and put it in front of me. Atfirst I thought that it was the same leaf that he saved from day to day, butthen I noticed that leaves are different. The Nagual said that when we realizedthat, we are not looking anymore, but gazing.\"Then he put stacks of dry leaves in front of me. He told me to scramble themwith my left hand and feel them as I gazed at them. A dreamer moves the leavesin spirals, gazes at them and then dreams of the designs that the leaves make.The Nagual said that dreamers can consider themselves as having mastered leafgazing when they dream the designs of the leaves first, and then find those samedesigns the next day in their pile of dry leaves.\"The Nagual said that gazing at leaves fortifies the second attention. If yougaze at a pile of leaves for hours, as he used to make me do, your thoughts getquiet. Without thoughts, the attention of the tonal wanes and suddenly yoursecond attention hooks onto the leaves and the leaves become something else.\"The Nagual called the moment when the second attention hooks onto something'stopping the world'; and that is correct. The world stops.\"For this reason, there should always be someone around when we first learn togaze. We never know about the quirks of our second attention. Since we havenever used it, we have to become familiar with it before we could venture intogazing alone.\"The difficulty in gazing is to learn to quiet down the thoughts. The Nagualsaid that he preferred to teach us how to do that with a pile of leaves becausewe could get all the leaves we needed any time we wanted to gaze. But anythingelse would do the same job.\"Once you can stop the world, you are a gazer. And since the only way ofstopping the world is by trying, the Nagual made all of us gaze at dry leavesfor years and years. I think it's the best way to reach our second attention.\"He combined gazing at dry leaves and looking for our hands in dreaming. It tookme about a year to find my hands, and four years to stop the world. The Nagualsaid that once you have trapped your second attention with dry leaves, you dogazing and dreaming to enlarge it. And that's all there is to gazing.\"\"You make it sound so simple, Gorda.\"\"Everything the Toltecs do is very simple. The Nagual said that all we needed todo in order to trap our second attention was to try and try. All of us stoppedthe world by gazing at dry leaves.\"You and Eligio were different. You yourself did it with power plants, but Idon't know what path the Nagual followed with Eligio. He never wanted to tellme. He told me about you because we have the same task.\"I mentioned that I had written in my notes that I had had the first completeawareness of having stopped the world only a few days before. She laughed.\"You stopped the world before any of us,\" she said. \"What do you think you didwhen you took all those power plants? You've never done it by gazing like wedid, that's all.\"\"Was the pile of dry leaves the only thing the Nagual made you gaze at?\"\"Once dreamers know how to stop the world, they can gaze at other things; andfinally when the dreamers lose their form altogether, they can gaze at anything.I do that. I can go into anything. He made us follow a certain order in gazing,though.\"First we gazed at small plants. The Nagual warned us that small plants are verydangerous. Their power is concentrated. They have a very intense light and theyfeel when dreamers are gazing at them. They immediately move their light andshoot it at the gazer. Dreamers have to choose one kind of plant to gaze at.\"Next we gazed at trees. Dreamers also have a particular kind of tree to gazeat. In this respect you and I are the same; both of us are eucalyptus gazers.\"By the look on my face she must have guessed my next question.\"The Nagual said that with his smoke you could very easily get your secondattention to work,\" she went on. \"You focused your attention lots of times onthe Nagual's predilection, the crows. He said that, once, your second attentionfocused so perfectly on a crow that it flew away, like a crow flies, to the onlyeucalyptus tree that was around.\"For years I had dwelled upon that experience. I could not regard it in any otherway except as an inconceivably complex hypnotic state brought about by thepsychotropic mushrooms contained in don Juan's smoking mixture; in conjunctionwith his expertise as a manipulator of behavior.He suggested a perceptual catharsis in me; that of turning into a crow andperceiving the world as a crow. The result was that I perceived the world in amanner that could not have possibly been part of my inventory of pastexperiences. La Gorda's explanation somehow had simplified everything.She said that the Nagual next made them gaze at moving, living creatures. Hetold them that small insects were by far the best subject. Their mobility madethem innocuous to the gazer, the opposite of plants which drew their lightdirectly from the earth.The next step was to gaze at rocks. She said that rocks were very old andpowerful and had a specific light which was rather greenish in contrast with thewhite light of plants and the yellowish light of mobile, living beings. Rocksdid not open up easily to gazers, but it was worthwhile for gazers to persistbecause rocks had special secrets concealed in their core, secrets that couldaid sorcerers in their \"dreaming.\"\"What are the things that rocks reveal to you?\" I asked.\"When I gaze into the very core of a rock,\" she said, \"I always catch a whiff ofa special scent proper to that rock. When I roam around in my dreaming, I knowwhere I am because I'm guided by those scents.\"She said that the time of the day was an important factor in tree and rockgazing. In the early morning trees and rocks were stiff and their light wasfaint. Around noon was when they were at their best, and gazing at that time wasdone for borrowing their light and power. In the late afternoon and earlyevening trees and rocks were quiet and sad, especially trees. La Gorda said thatat that hour trees gave the feeling that they were gazing back at the gazer.A second series in the order of gazing was to gaze at cyclic phenomena: rain andfog. She said that gazers can focus their second attention on the rain itselfand move with it, or focus it on the background and use the rain as a magnifyingglass of sorts to reveal hidden features. Places of power or places to beavoided are found by gazing through rain. Places of power are yellowish andplaces to be avoided are intensely green.La Gorda said that fog was unquestionably the most mysterious thing on earth fora gazer and that it could be used in the same two ways that rain was used. Butit did not easily yield to women, and even after she had lost her human form, itremained unattainable to her. She said that the Nagual once made her 'see' agreen mist at the head of a fog bank and told her that was the second attentionof a fog gazer who lived in the mountains where she and the Nagual were, andthat he was moving with the fog. She added that fog was used to uncover theghosts of things that were no longer there and that the true feat of fog gazerswas to let their second attention go into whatever their gazing was revealing tothem.I told her that once while I was with don Juan I had seen a bridge formed out ofa fog bank. I was aghast at the clarity and precise detail of that bridge. To meit was more than real. The scene was so intense and vivid that I had beenincapable of forgetting it. Don Juan's comments had been that I would have tocross that bridge someday.\"I know about it,\" she said. \"The Nagual told me that someday when you havemastery over your second attention, you'll cross that bridge with thatattention; the same way you flew like a crow with that attention. He said thatif you become a sorcerer, a bridge will form for you out of the fog and you willcross it and disappear from this world forever. Just like he himself has done.\"\"Did he disappear like that over a bridge?\"\"Not over a bridge. But you witnessed how he and Genaro stepped into the crackbetween the worlds in front of your very eyes. Nestor said that only Genarowaved his hand to say good-bye the last time you saw them. The Nagual did notwave because he was opening the crack. The Nagual told me that when the secondattention has to be called upon to assemble itself, all that is needed is themotion of opening that door. That's the secret of the Toltec dreamers once theyare formless.\"I wanted to ask her about don Juan and don Genaro stepping through that crack.She made me stop with a light touch of her hand on my mouth.She said that another series was distance and cloud gazing. In both, the effortof gazers was to let their second attention go to the place they were gazing at.Thus, they covered great distances or rode on clouds. In the case of cloudgazing, the Nagual never permitted them to gaze at thunderheads. He told themthat they had to be formless before they could attempt that feat; and that theycould not only ride on a thunderhead but on a thunderbolt itself.La Gorda laughed and asked me to guess who would be daring and crazy enoughactually to try gazing at thunderheads. I could think of no one else butJosefina. La Gorda said that Josefina tried gazing at thunderheads every timeshe could when the Nagual was away until one day a thunderbolt nearly killedher.\"Genaro was a thunderbolt sorcerer,\" she went on. \"His first two apprentices,Benigno and Nestor, were singled out for him by his friend the thunder. He saidthat he was looking for plants in a very remote area where the Indians are veryprivate and don't like visitors of any kind. They had given Genaro permission tobe on their land since he spoke their language. Genaro was picking some plantswhen it began to rain. There were some houses around, but the people wereunfriendly and he didn't want to bother them. He was about to crawl into a holewhen he saw a young man coming down the road riding a bicycle heavily laden withgoods.\"It was Benigno, the man from the town, who dealt with those Indians. Hisbicycle got stuck in the mud, and right there a thunderbolt struck him. Genarothought that he had been killed. People in the houses had seen what happened andcame out. Benigno was more scared than hurt, but his bicycle and all hismerchandise were ruined. Genaro stayed with him for a week and cured him.\"Almost the same thing happened to Nestor. He used to buy medicinal plants fromGenaro, and one day he followed him into the mountains to see where he pickedhis plants so he wouldn't have to pay for them anymore. Genaro went very farinto the mountains on purpose. He intended to make Nestor get lost. It wasn'training but there were thunderbolts, and suddenly a thunderbolt struck theground and ran over the dry ground like a snake. It ran right between Nestor'slegs and hit a rock ten yards away.\"Genaro said that the bolt had charred the inside of Nestor's legs. Histesticles were swollen and he got very ill. Genaro had to cure him for a weekright in those mountains.\"By the time Benigno and Nestor were cured, they were also hooked. Men have tobe hooked. Women don't need that. Women go freely into anything. That's theirpower and at the same time their drawback. Men have to be led and women have tobe contained.\"She giggled and said that no doubt she had a lot of maleness in her, for sheneeded to be led, and that I must have a lot of femaleness in me, for I neededto be contained.The last series was fire, smoke, and shadow gazing. She said that for a gazer,fire is not bright but black, and so is smoke. Shadows, on the other hand, arebrilliant and have color and movement in them.There were two more things that were kept separate, star and water gazing.Stargazing was done by sorcerers who have lost their human form. She said thatshe had fared very well at stargazing, but could not handle gazing at water,especially running water, which was used by formless sorcerers to gather theirsecond attention and transport it to anyplace they needed to go.\"All of us are terrified of water,\" she went on. \"A river gathers the secondattention and takes it away and there is no way of stopping. The Nagual told meabout your feats of water gazing. But he also told me that one time you nearlydisintegrated in the water of a shallow river and that you can't even take abath now.\"Don Juan had made me stare at the water of an irrigation ditch behind his housevarious times while he had me under the influence of his smoking mixture. I hadexperienced inconceivable sensations. Once I saw myself all green as if I werecovered with algae. After that he recommended that I avoid water.\"Has my second attention been injured by water?\" I asked.\"It has,\" she replied. \"You are a very indulging man. The Nagual warned you tobe cautious, but you went beyond your limits with running water. The Nagual saidthat you could've used water like no one else, but it wasn't your fate to bemoderate.\"She pulled her bench closer to mine.\"That's all there is to gazing,\" she said. \"But there are other things I musttell you before you leave.\"\"What things, Gorda?\"\"First of all, before I say anything, you must round up your second attentionfor the little sisters and me.\"\"I don't think I can do that.\"La Gorda stood up and went into the house. She came back a moment later with asmall, thick, round cushion made out of the same natural fiber used in makingnets. Without saying a word she led me again to the front porch. She said thatshe had made that cushion herself for her comfort when she was learning to gaze,because the position of the body was of great importance while one was gazing.One had to sit on the ground on a soft mat of leaves, or on a cushion made outof natural fibers. The back had to be propped against a tree, or a stump, or aflat rock. The body had to be thoroughly relaxed. The eyes were never fixed onthe object, in order to avoid tiring them. The gaze consisted in scanning veryslowly the object gazed at, going counterclockwise but without moving the head.She added that the Nagual had made them plant those thick poles so they coulduse them to prop themselves.She had me sit on her cushion and prop my back against a pole. She told me thatshe was going to guide me in gazing at a power spot that the Nagual had in theround hills across the valley. She hoped that by gazing at it I would get thenecessary energy to round up my second attention.She sat down very close to me, to my left, and began giving me instructions.Almost in a whisper she told me to keep my eyelids half closed and stare at theplace where two enormous round hills converged. There was a narrow, steep watercanyon there. She said that that particular gazing consisted of four separateactions.The first one was to use the brim of my hat as a visor to shade off theexcessive glare from the sun and allow only a minimal amount of light to come tomy eyes.The second step was to half-close my eyelids.The third step was to sustain the opening of my eyelids in order to maintain auniform flow of light.And the fourth step was to distinguish the water canyon in the backgroundthrough the mesh of light fibers on my eyelashes.I could not follow her instructions at first. The sun was high over the horizonand I had to tilt my head back. I tipped my hat until I had blocked off most ofthe glare with the brim. That seemed to be all that was needed. As soon as Ihalf closed my eyes, a bit of light that appeared as if it were coming from thetip of my hat literally exploded on my eyelashes, which were acting as a filterthat created a web of light. I kept my eyelids half closed and played with theweb of light for a moment until I could distinguish the dark vertical outline ofthe water canyon in the background.La Gorda told me then to gaze at the middle part of the canyon until I couldspot a very dark brown blotch. She said that it was a hole in the canyon whichwas not there for the eye that looks, but only for the eye that 'sees'.She warned me that I had to exercise my control as soon as I had isolated thatblotch so that it would not pull me toward it. Rather, I was supposed to zoom inon it and gaze into it. She suggested that the moment I found the hole I shouldpress my shoulders on hers to let her know. She slid sideways until she wasleaning on me.I struggled for a moment to keep the four actions coordinated and steady, andsuddenly a dark spot was formed in the middle of the canyon. I noticedimmediately that I was not seeing it in the way I usually see. The dark spot wasrather an impression; a visual distortion of sorts. The moment my control wanedit disappeared. It was in my field of perception only if I kept the four actionsunder control. I remembered then that don Juan had engaged me countless times in a similaractivity. He used to hang a small piece of cloth from a low branch of a bush,which was strategically located to be in line with specific geologicalformations in the mountains in the background, such as water canyons or slopes.By making me sit about fifty feet away from that piece of cloth, and having mestare through the low branches of the bush where the cloth hung, he used tocreate a special perceptual effect in me. The piece of cloth, which was always ashade darker than the geological formation I was staring at, seemed to be atfirst a feature of that formation.The idea was to let my perception play without analyzing it. I failed every timebecause I was thoroughly incapable of suspending judgment, and my mind alwaysentered into some rational speculation about the mechanics of my phantomperception. This time I felt no need whatsoever for speculations. La Gorda was not animposing figure that I unconsciously needed to fight, as don Juan had obviouslybeen to me.The dark blotch in my field of perception became almost black. I leaned on laGorda's shoulder to let her know. She whispered in my ear that I should struggleto keep my eyelids in the position they were in and breathe calmly from myabdomen. I should not let the blotch pull me, but gradually go into it. Thething to avoid was letting the hole grow and suddenly engulf me. In the eventthat that happened I had to open my eyes immediately.I began to breathe as she had prescribed, and thus I could keep my eyelids fixedindefinitely at the appropriate aperture.I remained in that position for quite some time. Then I noticed that I had begunto breathe normally and that it had not disturbed my perception of the darkblotch. But suddenly the dark blotch began to move, to pulsate, and before Icould breathe calmly again, the blackness moved forward and enveloped me. Ibecame frantic and opened my eyes.La Gorda said that I was doing distance gazing and for that it was necessary tobreathe the way she had recommended. She urged me to start all over again. Shesaid that the Nagual used to make them sit for entire days rounding up theirsecond attention by gazing at that spot. He cautioned them repeatedly about thedanger of being engulfed because of the jolt the body suffered.It took me about an hour of gazing to do what she had delineated. To zoom in onthe brown spot and gaze into it meant that the brown patch in my field ofperception lightened up quite suddenly. As it became clearer, I realized thatsomething in me was performing an impossible act.I felt that I was actually advancing toward that spot; thus the impression I washaving that it was clearing up. Then I was so near to it that I coulddistinguish features in it, like rocks and vegetation. I came even closer andcould look at a peculiar formation on one rock. It looked like a roughly carvedchair. I liked it very much. Compared to it, the rest of the rocks seemed paleand uninteresting.I don't know how long I gazed at it. I could focus on every detail of it. I feltthat I could lose myself forever in its detail because there was no end to it.But something dispelled my view. Another strange image was superimposed on therock, and then another one, and another yet. I became annoyed with theinterference. At the instant I became annoyed, I also realized that la Gorda wasmoving my head from side to side from behind me. In a matter of seconds theconcentration of my gazing had been thoroughly dissipated.La Gorda laughed and said that she understood why I had caused the Nagual suchan intense concern. She had seen for herself that I indulged beyond my limits.She sat against the pole next to me and said that she and the little sisterswere going to gaze into the Nagual's power place. She then made a piercingbirdcall. A moment later the little sisters came out of the house and sat downto gaze with her.Their gazing mastery was obvious. Their bodies acquired a strange rigidity. Theydid not seem to be breathing at all. Their stillness was so contagious that Icaught myself half closing my eyes and staring into the hills.Gazing had been a true revelation to me. In performing it I had corroboratedsome important issues of don Juan's teachings. La Gorda had delineated the taskin a definitely vague manner. 'To zoom in on it' was more a command than adescription of a process, and yet it was a description- providing that oneessential requirement had been fulfilled. Don Juan had called that requirementstopping the internal dialogue.From la Gorda's statements about gazing, it was obvious to me that the effectdon Juan had been after in making them gaze was to teach them to stop theinternal dialogue. La Gorda had expressed it as 'quieting down the thoughts'.Don Juan had taught me to do that very same thing, although he had made mefollow the opposite path.Instead of teaching me to focus my view, as gazers did, he taught me to open it;to flood my awareness by not focusing my sight on anything. I had to sort offeel with my eyes everything in the 180-degree range in front of me while I keptmy eyes unfocused just above the line of the horizon.It was very difficult for me to gaze, because it entailed reversing thattraining. As I tried to gaze, my tendency was to open up. The effort of keepingthat tendency in check, however, made me shut off my thoughts. Once I had turnedoff my internal dialogue, it was not difficult to gaze as la Gorda hadprescribed. Don Juan had asserted time and time again that the essential feature of hissorcery was shutting off the internal dialogue. In terms of the explanation laGorda had given me about the two realms of attention, stopping the internaldialogue was an operational way of describing the act of disengaging theattention of the tonal.Don Juan had also said that once we stop our internal dialogue we also stop theworld. That was an operational description of the inconceivable process offocusing our second attention. He had said that some part of us is always keptunder lock and key because we are afraid of it, and that to our reason, thatpart of us was like an insane relative that we keep locked in a dungeon.That part was, in la Gorda's terms, our second attention; and when it finallycould focus on something, the world stopped. Since we, as average men, know onlythe attention of the tonal, it is not too farfetched to say that once thatattention is canceled, the world indeed has to stop. The focusing of our wild,untrained second attention has to be, perforce, terrifying. Don Juan was rightin saying that the only way to keep that insane relative from bursting in on uswas by shielding ourselves with our endless internal dialogue. La Gorda and the little sisters stood up after perhaps thirty minutes of gazing.La Gorda signaled me with her head to follow them. They went to the kitchen. LaGorda pointed to a bench for me to sit on. She said that she was going up theroad to meet the Genaros and bring them over. She left through the front door.The little sisters sat around me. Lidia volunteered to answer anything I wantedto ask her. I asked her to tell me about her gazing into don Juan's power spot,but she did not understand me.\"I'm a distance and shadow gazer,\" she said. \"After I became a gazer the Nagualmade me start all over again and had me gaze this time at the shadows of leavesand plants and trees and rocks. Now I never look at anything anymore. I justlook at their shadows. Even if there is no light at all, there are shadows. Evenat night there are shadows. Because I'm a shadow gazer, I'm also a distancegazer. I can gaze at shadows even in the distance.\"The shadows in the early morning don't tell much. The shadows rest at thattime. So it's useless to gaze very early in the day. Around six in the morningthe shadows wake up, and they are best around five in the afternoon. Then theyare fully awake.\"\"What do the shadows tell you?\"\"Everything I want to know. They tell me things because they have heat, or cold,or because they move, or because they have colors. I don't know yet all thethings that colors and heat and cold mean. The Nagual left it up to me tolearn.\"\"How do you learn?\"\"In my dreaming. Dreamers must gaze in order to do dreaming and then they mustlook for their dreams in their gazing.\"For example, the Nagual made me gaze at the shadows of rocks, and then in mydreaming, I found out that those shadows had light. So I looked for the light inthe shadows from then on until I found it.\"Gazing and dreaming go together. It took me a lot of gazing at shadows to getmy dreaming of shadows going. And then it took me a lot of dreaming and gazingto get the two together and really see in the shadows what I was seeing in mydreaming. See what I mean? Everyone of us does the same. Rosa's dreaming isabout trees because she's a tree gazer, and Josefina's is about clouds becauseshe's a cloud gazer. They gaze at trees and clouds until they match theirdreaming\"Rosa and Josefina shook their heads in agreement.\"What about la Gorda?\" I asked.\"She's a flea gazer,\" Rosa said, and all of them laughed.\"La Gorda doesn't like to be bitten by fleas,\" Lidia explained. \"She is formlessand can gaze at anything, but she used to be a rain gazer.\"\"What about Pablito?\"\"He gazes at women's crotches,\" Rosa answered with a deadpan expression.They laughed. Rosa slapped me on the back.\"I understand that since he's your partner he's taking after you,\" she said.They banged on the table and shook the benches with their feet as they laughed.\"Pablito is a rock gazer,\" Lidia said. \"Nestor is a rain and plant gazer andBenigno is a distance gazer. But don't ask me any more about gazing because Iwill lose my power if I tell you more.\"\"How come la Gorda tells me everything?\"\"La Gorda lost her form,\" Lidia replied. \"Whenever I lose mine I'll tell youeverything too. But by then you won't care to hear it. You care only becauseyou're stupid like us. The day we lose our form we'll all stop being stupid.\"\"Why do you ask so many questions when you know all this?\" Rosa asked.\"Because he's like us,\" Lidia said. \"He's not a true nagual. He's still a man.\"She turned and faced me. For an instant her face was hard and her eyes piercingand cold, but her expression softened as she spoke to me.\"You and Pablito are partners,\" she said. \"You really like him, don't you?\"I thought for a moment before I answered. I told her that somehow I trusted himimplicitly. For no overt reason at all I had a feeling of kinship with him.\"You like him so much that you fouled him up,\" she said in an accusing tone. \"Onthat mountaintop where you jumped, he was getting to his second attention byhimself and you forced him to jump with you.\"\"I only held him by the arm,\" I said in protest.\"A sorcerer doesn't hold another sorcerer by the arm,\" she said. \"Each of us isvery capable. You don't need any of us three to help you. Only a sorcerer whosees and is formless can help. On that mountaintop where you jumped, you weresupposed to go first. Now Pablito is tied to you. I suppose you intended to helpus in the same way. God, the more I think about you, the more I despise you.\"Rosa and Josefina mumbled their agreement. Rosa stood up and faced me with ragein her eyes. She demanded to know what I intended to do with them. I said that Iintended to leave very soon. My statement seemed to shock them. They all spokeat the same time. Lidia's voice rose above the others. She said that the time toleave had been the night before, and that she had hated it the moment I decidedto stay. Josefina began to yell obscenities at me.I felt a sudden shiver and stood up and yelled at them to be quiet with a voicethat was not my own. They looked at me horrified. I tried to look casual, but Ihad frightened myself as much as I had frightened them.At that moment la Gorda stepped out to the kitchen as if she had been hiding inthe front room waiting for us to start a fight. She said that she had warned allof us not to fall into one another's webs.I had to laugh at the way she scolded us as if we were children.She said that we owed respect to each other; that respect among warriors was amost delicate matter. The little sisters knew how to behave like warriors witheach other, and so did the Genaros among themselves; but when I would come intoeither group, or when the two groups got together, all of them ignored theirwarrior's knowledge and behaved like slobs.We sat down. La Gorda sat next to me. After a moment's pause Lidia explainedthat she was afraid I was going to do to them what I had done to Pablito. LaGorda laughed and said that she would never let me help any of them in thatmanner.I told her that I could not understand what I had done to Pablito that was sowrong. I had not been aware of what I had done, and if Nestor had not told me Iwould never have known that I had actually picked Pablito up. I even wondered ifNestor had perhaps exaggerated a bit, or that maybe he had made a mistake.La Gorda said that the Witness would not make a stupid mistake like that, muchless exaggerate it, and that the Witness was the most perfect warrior amongthem.\"Sorcerers don't help one another like you helped Pablito,\" she went on. \"Youbehaved like a man in the street. The Nagual had taught us all to be warriors.He said that a warrior had no compassion for anyone.For him, to have compassion meant that you wished the other person to be likeyou; to be in your shoes; and you lent a hand just for that purpose. You didthat to Pablito. The hardest thing in the world is for a warrior to let othersbe. When I was fat, I worried because Lidia and Josefina did not eat enough. Iwas afraid that they would get ill and die from not eating. I did my utmost tofatten them and I meant only the best.The impeccability of a warrior is to let them be and to support them in whatthey are. That means, of course, that you trust them to be impeccable warriorsthemselves.\"\"But what if they are not impeccable warriors?\" I said.\"Then it's your duty to be impeccable yourself and not say a word,\" she replied.\"The Nagual said that only a sorcerer who sees and is formless can afford tohelp anyone. That's why he helped us and made us what we are. You don't thinkthat you can go around picking people up off the street to help them, do you?\"Don Juan had already put me face to face with the dilemma that I could not helpmy fellow beings in any way. In fact, to his understanding, every effort to helpon our part was an arbitrary act guided by our own self-interest alone.One day when I was with him in the city, I picked up a snail that was in themiddle of the sidewalk and tucked it safely under some vines. I was sure that ifI had left it in the middle of the sidewalk, people would sooner or later havestepped on it. I thought that by moving it to a safe place I had saved it.Don Juan pointed out that my assumption was a careless one because I had nottaken into consideration two important possibilities. One was that the snailmight have been escaping a sure death by poison under the leaves of the vine,and the other possibility was that the snail had enough personal power to crossthe sidewalk. By interfering I had not saved the snail but only made it losewhatever it had so painfully gained.I wanted, of course, to put the snail back where I had found it, but he did notlet me. He said that it was the snail's fate that an idiot crossed its path andmade it lose its momentum. If I left it where I had put it, it might be ableagain to gather enough power to go wherever it was going.I thought I had understood his point. Obviously I had only given him a shallowagreement. The hardest thing for me was to let others be.I told them the story. La Gorda patted my back.\"We're all pretty bad,\" she said. \"All five of us are awful people who don'twant to understand. I've gotten rid of most of my ugly side, but not all of ityet. We are rather slow, and in comparison to the Genaros we are gloomy anddomineering. The Genaros, on the other hand, are all like Genaro. There is verylittle awfulness in them.\"The little sisters shook their heads in agreement.\"You are the ugliest among us,\" Lidia said to me. \"I don't think we're that badin comparison to you.\"La Gorda giggled and tapped my leg as if telling me to agree with Lidia. I did,and all of them laughed like children.We remained silent for a long time.\"I'm getting now to the end of what I had to tell you,\" la Gorda said all of asudden.She made all of us stand up. She said that they were going to show me the Toltecwarrior's power stand. Lidia stood by my right side, facing me. She grabbed myhand with her right hand, palm to palm, but without interlocking the fingers.Then she hooked my arm right above the elbow with her left arm and held metightly against her chest. Josefina did exactly the same thing on my left side.Rosa stood face to face with me and hooked her arms under my armpits and grabbedmy shoulders. La Gorda came from behind me and embraced me at my waist,interlocking her fingers over my navel.All of us were about the same height and they could press their heads against myhead. La Gorda spoke very softly behind my left ear, but loud enough for all ofus to hear her. She said that we were going to try to put our second attentionin the Nagual's power place without anyone or anything prodding us. This timethere was no teacher to aid us or allies to spur us. We were going to go therejust by the force of our desire.I had the invincible urge to ask her what I should do. She said that I shouldlet my second attention focus on what I had gazed at.She explained that the particular formation which we were in was a Toltec powerarrangement. I was at that moment the center and binding force of the fourcorners of the world.Lidia was the east, the weapon that the Toltec warrior holds in his right hand;Rosa was the north, the shield harnessed on the front of the warrior; Josefinawas the west, the spirit catcher that the warrior holds in his left hand; and laGorda was the south, the basket which the warrior carries on his back and wherehe keeps his power objects.She said that the natural position of every warrior was to face the north, sincehe had to hold the weapon, the east, in his right hand. But the direction thatwe ourselves had to face was the south, slightly toward the east. Therefore, theact of power that the Nagual had left for us to perform was to changedirections.She reminded me that one of the first things that the Nagual had done to us wasto turn our eyes to face the southeast. That had been the way he had enticed oursecond attention to perform the feat which we were going to attempt then. Therewere two alternatives to that feat.One was for all of us to turn around to face the south, using me as an axis, andin so doing change around the basic value and function of all of them. Lidiawould be the west, Josefina, the east, Rosa, the south and she, the north.The other alternative was for us to change our direction and face the south butwithout turning around. That was the alternative of power, and it entailedputting on our second face.I told la Gorda that I did not understand what our second face was. She saidthat she had been entrusted by the Nagual to try getting the second attention ofall of us bundled up together, and that every Toltec warrior had two faces andfaced two opposite directions. The second face was the second attention.La Gorda suddenly released her grip. All the others did the same. She sat downagain and motioned me to sit by her. The little sisters remained standing. LaGorda asked me if everything was clear to me. It was, and at the same time itwas not. Before I had time to formulate a question, she blurted out that one ofthe last things the Nagual had entrusted her to tell me was that I had to changemy direction by summing up my second attention together with theirs, and put onmy power face to see what was behind me.La Gorda stood up and motioned me to follow her. She led me to the door of theirroom. She gently pushed me into the room. Once I had crossed the threshold,Lidia, Rosa, Josefina and she joined me, in that order, and then la Gorda closedthe door.The room was very dark. It did not seem to have any windows. La Gorda grabbed meby the arm and placed me in what I thought was the center of the room. All ofthem surrounded me. I could not see them at all. I could only feel them flankingme on four sides.After a while my eyes became accustomed to the darkness. I could see that theroom had two windows which had been blocked off by panels. A bit of light camethrough them and I could distinguish everybody. Then all of them held me the waythey had done a few minutes before, and in perfect unison they placed theirheads against mine. I could feel their hot breaths all around me. I closed myeyes in order to sum up the image of my gazing. I could not do it. I felt verytired and sleepy. My eyes itched terribly: I wanted to rub them, but Lidia andJosefina held my arms tightly.We stayed in that position for a very long time. My fatigue was unbearable andfinally I slumped. I thought that my knees had given in. I had the feeling thatI was going to collapse on the floor and fall asleep right there.But there was no floor. In fact, there was nothing underneath me. My fright uponrealizing that was so intense that I was fully awake in an instant. A forcegreater than my fright, however, pushed me back into that sleepy state again. Iabandoned myself.I was floating with them like a balloon. It was as if I had fallen asleep andwas dreaming and in that dream I saw a series of disconnected images. We were nolonger in the darkness of their room. There was so much light that it blindedme.At times I could see Rosa's face against mine. Out of the corner of my eyes Icould also see Lidia's and Josefina's. I could feel their foreheads pressed hardagainst my ears.And then the image would change and I would see instead la Gorda's face againstmine. Every time that happened she would put her mouth on mine and breathe. Idid not like that at all. Some force in me tried to get loose. I felt terrified.I tried to push all of them away. The harder I tried, the harder they held me.That convinced me that la Gorda had tricked me and had finally led me into adeath trap. But contrary to the others, la Gorda had been an impeccable player.The thought that she had played an impeccable hand made me feel better. At onepoint I did not care to struggle any longer. I became curious about the momentof my death which I believed was imminent, and I let go of myself. I experiencedthen an unequaled joy: an exuberance that I was sure was the herald of my end ifnot my death itself. I pulled Lidia and Josefina even closer to me.At that moment la Gorda was in front of me. I did not mind that she wasbreathing in my mouth. In fact, I was surprised that she stopped then. Theinstant she did, all of them also stopped pressing their heads on mine. Theybegan to look around and by so doing they also freed my head. I could move it.Lidia, la Gorda and Josefina were so close to me that I could see only throughthe opening in between their heads. I could not figure out where we were.One thing I was certain of was that we were not standing on the ground. We werein the air. Another thing I knew for sure was that we had shifted our order.Lidia was to my left and Josefina, to my right. La Gorda's face was covered withperspiration and so were Lidia's and Josefina's. I could only feel Rosa behindme. I could see her hands coming from my armpits and holding onto my shoulders.La Gorda was saying something I could not hear. She enunciated her words slowlyas if she were giving me time to read her lips, but I got caught up in thedetails of her mouth. At one instant I felt that the four of them were movingme. They were deliberately rocking me.That forced me to pay attention to la Gorda's silent words. I clearly read herlips this time. She was telling me to turn around. I tried but my head seemed tobe fixed. I felt that someone was biting my lips. I watched la Gorda. She wasnot biting me but she was looking at me as she mouthed her command to turn myhead around. As she talked, I also felt that she was actually licking my entireface or biting my lips and cheeks.La Gorda's face was somehow distorted. It looked big and yellowish. I thoughtthat perhaps since the whole scene was yellowish, her face was reflecting thatglow. I could almost hear her ordering me to turn my head around.Finally the annoyance that the biting was causing me made me shake my head. Andsuddenly the sound of la Gorda's voice became clearly audible. She was in backof me and she was yelling at me to turn my attention around.Rose was the one who was licking my face. I pushed her away from my face with myforehead. Rosa was weeping. Her face was covered with perspiration.I could hear la Gorda's voice behind me. She said that I had exhausted them byfighting them and that she did not know what to do to catch our originalattention. The little sisters were whining.My thoughts were crystal clear. My rational processes, however, were notdeductive. I knew things quickly and directly and there was no doubt of any sortin my mind. For instance, I knew immediately that I had to go back to sleepagain, and that that would make us plummet down. But I also knew that I had tolet them bring us to their house: I was useless for that.If I could focus my second attention at all, it would have had to be on a placethat don Juan had given me in northern Mexico. I had always been able to pictureit in my mind like nothing else in the world. I did not dare to sum up thatvision. I knew that we would have ended up there.I thought that I had to tell la Gorda what I knew, but I could not talk. Yetsome part of me knew that she understood. I trusted her implicitly and I fellasleep in a matter of seconds. In my dream I was looking at the kitchen of theirhouse. Pablito, Nestor and Benigno were there. They looked extraordinarily largeand they glowed.I could not focus my eyes on them because a sheet of transparent plasticmaterial was in between them and myself. Then I realized that it was as if Iwere looking at them through a glass window while somebody was throwing water onthe glass. Finally the glass shattered and the water hit me in the face.Pablito was drenching me with a bucket. Nestor and Benigno were also standingthere. La Gorda, the little sisters and I were sprawled on the ground in theyard behind the house. The Genaros were drenching us with buckets of water.I sprang up. Either the cold water or the extravagant experience I had just beenthrough had invigorated me. La Gorda and the little sisters put on a change ofclothes that the Genaros must have laid out in the sun. My clothes had also beenneatly laid on the ground.I changed without a word. I was experiencing the peculiar feeling that seems tofollow the focusing of the second attention; I could not talk, or rather I couldtalk but I did not want to.My stomach was upset. La Gorda seemed to sense it and pulled me gently to thearea in back of the fence. I became ill. La Gorda and the little sisters wereaffected the same way.I returned to the kitchen area and washed my face. The coldness of the waterseemed to restore my awareness. Pablito, Nestor and Benigno were sitting aroundthe table. Pablito had brought his chair. He stood up and shook hands with me.Then Nestor and Benigno did the same. La Gorda and the little sisters joined us.There seemed to be something wrong with me. My ears were buzzing. I felt dizzy.Josefina stood up and grabbed onto Rosa for support. I turned to ask la Gordawhat to do. Lidia was falling backward over the bench. I caught her, but herweight pulled me down and I fell over with her.I must have fainted. I woke up suddenly. I was lying on a straw mat in the frontroom. Lidia, Rosa and Josefina were sound asleep next to me. I had to crawl overthem to stand up. I nudged them but they did not wake up. I walked out to thekitchen. La Gorda was sitting with the Genaros around the table.\"Welcome back,\" Pablito said.He added that la Gorda had woken up a short while before. I felt that I was myold self again. I was hungry. La Gorda gave me a bowl of food. She said thatthey had already eaten. After eating I felt perfect in every respect except Icould not think as I usually do.My thoughts had quieted down tremendously. I did not like that state. I noticedthen that it was late afternoon. I had a sudden urge to jog in place facing thesun, the way don Juan used to make me do. I stood up and la Gorda joined me.Apparently she had had the same idea. Moving like that made me perspire. I gotwinded very quickly and returned to the table. La Gorda followed me. We sat downagain. The Genaros were staring at us. La Gorda handed me my writing pad.\"The Nagual here got us lost,\" la Gorda said.The moment she spoke I experienced a most peculiar bursting. My thoughts cameback to me in an avalanche. There must have been a change in my expression, forPablito embraced me and so did Nestor and Benigno.\"The Nagual is going to live! \" Pablito said loudly.La Gorda also seemed delighted. She wiped her forehead in a gesture of relief.She said that I had nearly killed all of them and myself with my terribletendency to indulge.\"To focus the second attention is no joke,\" Nestor said.\"What happened to us, Gorda?\" I asked.\"We got lost,\" she said. \"You began to indulge in your fear and we got lost inthat immensity. We couldn't focus our attention of the tonal anymore. But wesucceeded in bundling up our second attention with yours and now you have twofaces.\"Lidia, Rosa and Josefina stepped out into the kitchen at that moment. They weresmiling and seemed as fresh and vigorous as ever. They helped themselves to somefood. They sat down and nobody uttered a word while they ate. The moment thelast one had finished eating, la Gorda picked up where she had left off.\"Now you're a warrior with two faces,\" she went on. \"The Nagual said that all ofus have to have two faces to fare well in both attentions. He and Genaro helpedus to round up our second attention and turned us around so we could face in twodirections, but they didn't help you, because to be a true nagual you have toclaim your power all by yourself. You're still a long way from that, but let'ssay that now you're walking upright instead of crawling, and when you'veregained your completeness and have lost your form, you'll be gliding.\"Benigno made a gesture with his hand of a plane in flight and imitated the roarof the engine with his booming voice. The sound was truly deafening.Everybody laughed. The little sisters seemed to be delighted.I had not been fully aware until then that it was late afternoon. I said to laGorda that we must have slept for hours, for we had gone into their room beforenoon. She said that we had not slept long at all, that most of that time we hadbeen lost in the other world, and that the Genaros had been truly frightened anddespondent, because there was nothing they could do to bring us back.I turned to Nestor and asked him what they had actually done or seen while wewere gone. He stared at me for a moment before answering.\"We brought a lot of water to the yard,\" he said, pointing to some empty oilbarrels. \"Then all of you staggered into the yard and we poured water on you,that's all.\"\"Did we come out of the room?\" I asked him.Benigno laughed loudly. Nestor looked at la Gorda as if asking for permission oradvice.\"Did we come out of the room?\" la Gorda asked.\"No,\" Nestor replied.La Gorda seemed to be as anxious to know as I was, and that was alarming to me.She even coaxed Nestor to speak.\"You came from nowhere,\" Nestor said. \"I should also say that it wasfrightening. All of you were like fog. Pablito saw you first. You may have beenin the yard for a long time, but we didn't know where to look for you. ThenPablito yelled and all of us saw you. We have never seen anything like that.\"\"What did we look like?\" I asked.The Genaros looked at one another. There was an unbearably long silence. Thelittle sisters were staring at Nestor with their mouths open.\"You were like pieces of fog caught in a web,\" Nestor said. \"When we pouredwater on you, you became solid again.\"I wanted him to keep on talking, but la Gorda said that there was very littletime left because I had to leave at the end of the day; and she still had thingsto tell me. The Genaros stood up and shook hands with the little sisters and laGorda. They embraced me and told me that they only needed a few days in order toget ready to move away.Pablito put his chair upside down on his back. Josefina ran to the area aroundthe stove, picked up a bundle they had brought from dona Soledad's house, andplaced it between the legs of Pablito's chair which made an ideal carryingdevice.\"Since you're going home you might as well take this,\" she said. \"It belongs toyou anyway.\"Pablito shrugged his shoulders and shifted his chair in order to balance theload.Nestor signaled Benigno to take the bundle but Pablito would not let him.\"It's all right,\" he said. \"I might as well be a jackass as long as I'm carryingthis damn chair.\"\"Why do you carry it, Pablito?\" I asked.\"I have to store my power,\" he replied. \"I can't go around sitting on justanything. Who knows what kind of a creep sat there before me?\"He cackled and made the bundle wiggle by shaking his shoulders.After the Genaros left, la Gorda explained to me that Pablito began his crazyinvolvement with his chair to tease Lidia. He did not want to sit where she hadsat, but he had gotten carried away; and since he loved to indulge, he would notsit anywhere else except on his chair.\"He's capable of carrying it through life,\" la Gorda said to me with greatcertainty. \"He's almost as bad as you. He's your partner. You'll carry yourwriting pad through life and he'll carry his chair. What's the difference? Bothof you indulge more than the rest of us.\"The little sisters surrounded me and laughed, patting me on the back.\"It's very hard to get into our second attention,\" la Gorda went on, \"and tomanage it when you indulge as you do is even harder. The Nagual said that youshould know how difficult that managing is better than any of us.\"With his power plants, you learned to go very far into that other world. That'swhy you pulled us so hard today that we nearly died. We wanted to gather oursecond attention on the Nagual's spot, and you plunged us into something wedidn't know. We are not ready for it, but neither are you. You can't helpyourself, though: The power plants made you that way.\"The Nagual was right. All of us have to help you contain your second attention,and you have to help all of us to push ours. Your second attention can go veryfar, but it has no control. Ours can go only a little bit, but we have absolutecontrol over it.\"La Gorda and the little sisters, one by one, told me how frightening theexperience of being lost in the other world had been.\"The Nagual told me,\" la Gorda went on, \"that when he was gathering your secondattention with his smoke, you focused it on a gnat, and then the little gnatbecame the guardian of the other world for you.\"I told her that that was true. At her request I narrated to them the experiencedon Juan had made me undergo. With the aid of his smoking mixture, I hadperceived a gnat as a hundred foot high horrifying monster that moved withincredible speed and agility. The ugliness of that creature was nauseating, andyet there was an awesome magnificence to it.I also had had no way to accommodate that experience in my rational scheme ofthings. The only support for my intellect was my deep-seated certainty that oneof the effects of the psychotropic smoking mixture was to induce me tohallucinate the size of the gnat.I presented to them, especially to la Gorda, my rational causal explanation ofwhat had taken place. They laughed.\"There are no hallucinations,\" la Gorda said in a firm tone. \"If anybodysuddenly sees something different- something that was not there before- it isbecause that person's second attention has been gathered, and that person isfocusing it on something.\"Now, whatever is gathering that person's attention might be anything; maybeit's liquor, or maybe it's madness, or maybe it's the Nagual's smoking mixture.\"You saw a gnat and it became the guardian of the other world for you. And doyou know what that other world is? That other world is the world of our secondattention. The Nagual thought that perhaps your second attention was strongenough to pass the guardian and go into that world. But it wasn't. If it hadbeen, you might have gone into that world and never returned.\"The Nagual told me that he was prepared to follow you. But the guardian didn'tlet you pass and nearly killed you. The Nagual had to stop making you focus yoursecond attention with his power plants because you could only focus on theawesomeness of things.\"He had you do dreaming instead, so you could gather it in another way. But hewas sure your dreaming would also be awesome. There was nothing he could doabout it. You were following him in his own footsteps and he had an awesomefearsome side.\"They remained silent. It was as if all of them had been engulfed by theirmemories.La Gorda said that the Nagual had once pointed out to me a very special redinsect, in the mountains of his homeland. She asked me if I remembered it. I did remember it. Years before don Juan had taken me to an area unknown to mein the mountains of northern Mexico. With extreme care he showed me some roundinsects the size of a ladybug. Their backs were brilliantly red. I wanted to getdown on the ground and examine them, but he would not let me. He told me that Ishould watch them, without staring, until I had memorized their shape, because Iwas supposed to remember them always. He then explained some intricate detailsof their behavior, making it sound like a metaphor. He was telling me about thearbitrary importance of our most cherished mores. He pointed out some allegedmores of those insects and pitted them against ours. The comparison made theimportance of our beliefs look ridiculous. \"Just before he and Genaro left,\" la Gorda went on, \"the Nagual took me to thatplace in the mountains where those little bugs lived. I had already been thereonce, and so had everyone else. The Nagual made sure that all of us knew thoselittle creatures, although he never let us gaze at them.\"While I was there with him he told me what to do with you and what I shouldtell you. I've already told you most of what he asked me to except for this lastthing. It has to do with what you've been asking everybody about: 'Where are theNagual and Genaro?'\"Now I'll tell you exactly where they are. The Nagual said that you willunderstand this better than any of us. None of us has ever seen the guardian.None of us has ever been in that yellow sulfur world where he lives. You are theonly one among us who has.\"The Nagual said that he followed you into that world when you focused yoursecond attention on the guardian. He intended to go there with you, perhapsforever, if you would've been strong enough to pass. It was then that he firstfound out about the world of those little red bugs. He said that their world wasthe most beautiful and perfect thing one could imagine.\"So, when it was time for him and Genaro to leave this world, they gathered alltheir second attention and focused it on that world. Then the Nagual opened thecrack, as you yourself witnessed, and they slipped through it into that worldwhere they are waiting for us to join them someday. The Nagual and Genaro likedbeauty. They went there for their sheer enjoyment.\"She looked at me. I had nothing to say. She had been right in saying that powerhad to time her revelation perfectly if it were going to be effective. I felt ananguish I could not express. It was as if I wanted to weep and yet I was not sador melancholy. I longed for something inexpressible, but that longing was notmine. Like so many of the feelings and sensations I had had since my arrival, itwas alien to me.Nestor's assertions about Eligio came to my mind. I told la Gorda what he hadsaid, and she asked me to narrate to them the visions of my journey between thetonal and the nagual which I had had upon jumping into the abyss. When Ifinished they all seemed frightened. La Gorda immediately isolated my vision ofthe dome.\"The Nagual told us that our second attention would someday focus on that dome,\"she said. \"That day we will be all second attention, just like the Nagual andGenaro are, and that day we will join them.\"\"Do you mean, Gorda, that we will go as we are?\" I asked.\"Yes, we will go as we are. The body is the first attention, the attention ofthe tonal. When it becomes the second attention, it simply goes into the otherworld. Jumping into the abyss gathered all your second attention for a while.\"But Eligio was stronger and his second attention was fixed by that jump. That'swhat happened to him and he was just like all of us. But there is no way oftelling where he is. Even the Nagual himself didn't know. But if he is someplacehe is in that dome. Or he is bouncing from vision to vision, perhaps for a wholeeternity.\"La Gorda said that in my journey between the tonal and the nagual, I hadcorroborated on a grand scale the possibility that our whole being becomes allsecond attention; and on a much smaller scale when I got all of them lost in theworld of that attention earlier that day; and also when she transported us halfa mile in order to flee from the allies.She added that the problem the Nagual had left for us as a challenge was whetheror not we would be capable of developing our will, or the power of our secondattention to focus indefinitely on anything we wanted.We were quiet for a while. It seemed that it was time for me to leave, but Icould not move. The thought of Eligio's fate had paralyzed me. Whether he hadmade it to the dome of our rendezvous or whether he had gotten caught in thetremendum, the image of his journey was maddening. It took no effort at all forme to envision it because I had the experience of my own journey.The other world which don Juan had referred to, practically since the moment wemet, had always been a metaphor to me; an obscure way of labeling someperceptual distortion, or at best a way of talking about some undefinable stateof being.Even though don Juan had made me perceive indescribable features of the world, Icould not consider my experiences to be anything beyond a play on my perception;a directed mirage of sorts that he had managed to make me undergo, either bymeans of psychotropic plants, or by means I could not deduce rationally.Every time that had happened, I had shielded myself with the thought that theunity of the 'me' I knew and was familiar with had been only temporarilydisplaced.Inevitably, as soon as that unity was restored, the world became again thesanctuary for my inviolable rational self. The scope that la Gorda had openedwith her revelations was terrifying.She stood up and pulled me up off the bench. She said that I had to leave beforethe twilight set in. All of them walked with me to my car and we said good-bye.La Gorda gave me a last command. She told me that on my return I should godirectly to the Genaros' house.\"We don't want to see you until you know what to do,\" she said with a radiantsmile. \"But don't delay too long.\"The little sisters nodded.\"Those mountains are not going to let us stay here much longer,\" she said, andwith a subtle movement of her chin she pointed to the ominous eroded hillsacross the valley.I asked her one more question. I wanted to know if she had any idea where theNagual and Genaro would go after we had completed our rendezvous. She looked upat the sky, raised her arms, and made an indescribable gesture with them topoint out that there was no limit to that vastness. ### \"The Second Ring of Power\" -by Carlos Castaneda - The End ###"}]
