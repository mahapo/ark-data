Only a l i m i te d n u m ber of positions were available, and Briicke had two excellent assistants ahead of Freud. Time had slipped by, and Freud's medical class had al- ready graduated. He had also, in the rnean- t ime, met and f a llen i n l o v e w i t h M a r t h a Bernays, the young woman who was to be- come his wife. Since income was now more than ever an important consideration, Freud talked things over with Briicke and decided to go on, complete his medical degree, and enter medical practice as a neurologist (spe- cialist in the nervous system ). Before doing so he was fortunate enough- with the help of Br iicke — to obtain a small t raveling grant, w h i c h p e r m i t te d h i m t o spend a year (1885) in Paris studying under the famous neurologist Jean Charcot at the Salpetriere (mental hospital ) .

Hyr teria is a mental disorder (neurosis ) in which patients believe they have lost some sensory (like vision ) or motor (like walking ) function, although they have not. Under hypnosis the patient suRering from hysterical blindness or lameness can often be made to see or walk again. Students of Freud have noted that his contact with the French helped support him years later, when he began to deviate from the kinds of chemical-mathematical theories to which Briicke had lim ited his scientiFic ex- planations.' After a short stay in Berlin, where Freud served a m e d ical r e sidency i n n e u r o l o gy (which included the direction of a children' s ward ), he returned to Vienna to marry and to take up the practice of neurology. Today, his medical specialty would come under the heading of neuropsychiatry, or simply p sy- c hiatry. Even b e f ore h e h a d t r a v e le d t o France, Freud had made the acquaintance of Joseph Breuer, a neurologist like himself but an older, more settled and successful practi- tioner in the Vienna area. Later, Breuer was instrumental in helping Freud to establish a practice in Vienna. He was important in the evolution of psychoanalysis as well, and we shall turn to F r e u d's pr ofessional relations with him in the next section. A nother important fr i end o f F r e u d' s i n his early years as practitioner was Wilhelm Fliess, who had apparently been introduced to Freud by Breuer. Fliess was a successful nose-throat specialist who practiced in Berlin, thus accounting for th e n eed to c o r respond through the mails with his friend in V i enna (though they also met fairly regularly to ex- change scientiFic points of view ). Fortunately, Fliess kept all of his letters from Freud, and this correspondence reveals the remarkable fact that virtually all of F r e u d' s theoretical ideas had been sketched in during the period o f 1887 through just after th e t ur n o f t h e twentieth century; the 1890s were especially important: Freud observed that the \"secret of d reams\" was revealed to hi m o n 2 R j u l y 1895.' His father died in October 1896, which seems to have increased certain anxiety ten- dencies and psychosomatic problems (colitis ) w hich troubled Freud t h r o ughout hi s l i f e . Having by this time w o r ked ou t a g e n eral a pproach to th e s t ud y a n d t r e a t m en t o f neuroses, Freud began in 1897 his celebrated self-analysis, from which w e t r ac e the per- sonality theory and psychotherapy procedure now called psychoanalysis; In the 1900 — 1901 period Freud published his two great initial works, The Interpretation o f Dreams (Vol- umes IV and V ) and The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (Volume VI ).

The common factor in al l t h e se recollected be- ginnings was that A nn a wa s f e eling some k ind of strong emotion at th e t i m e , w h i c h for various reasons she could not express. For example, she was feeling anger toward her father, but as a good daughter she refrained from expressing her growing r age. Instead, she found herself unable to understand her native German tongue when her father spoke to her, though she could still co m municate in English! Gradually, her inability to under- stand German spread to contacts with others Breuer encouraged Anna to e x p ress her formerly unexpressed emotions while under hypnosis and reliving the old situation, and to his complete surprise he found that as she worked through each symptom in t his fash- ion it disappeared. Breuer called the situation o ut of the past in w h ich A nn a ha d no t r e - acted emotionally the pathognomic situation and the emotion that she did not express, the strangulated a Pect. ( It is c o mmon fo r t h e words a Pecr and emotion to be u s ed inter- changeably in psychology. ) T he central symptom o f t h e i m m o b i l e right arm provided the most dr amatic hyp- notic recollection. Anna recalled sitting in a chair next to the bed of her father, who was terminal ly ill (he later died ). Her m o t her was out of the house and the servants were dismissed for th e e v e n ing, s o d o u b t l essly Anna felt frightened at the responsibility of looking after someone so close to death. Suf- f ering from fatigue and prone to w ha t sh e called absences (momentary blackouts like sleepwalking ), Anna seems to have had what Breuer called a ua (ing dream 'S he \"saw\" a. b lack snake coming from th e w a l l n ex t t o her father's bed, ready to bite the dying man. Anna tried to fend the snake off, moving her right arm from the back of her chair where The Breuer Period Around 1880, while Freud was still in medi- cal school, Breuer undertook the treatment of a twenty-one-year-old woman who was bed- ridden, suffering from a series of hysterical symptoms like headache, loss of speech, in- ability to understand when spoken to, visual distortions, and in particular, a pronounced l oss of function an d f e e l in g i n h e r r i g h t arm.' This w o man was t o b ecome the pa- tient in the celebrated case of Anna O. (a pseudonym ), which in a way is the very first p sychoanalytical case history.

Apparently it ha d b e - come slightly numb due to the lack of proper blood circulation, for when she tried to move it, she could not. Glancing at her hand, Anna was further startled to see that her fi n g ers had turned into little snakes with her finger- nails appearing to be like \"death's heads.\" Though she wa s u n a ble t o s c r e am or o therwise express the terror she felt at t h e time (pathognomic situation ), Anna did d o so under hypnosis, and as we have noted, this release led to an improvement in her condi- tion. After several such relivings of the path- o gnomic situation in w h i c h sh e no w g a v e vent to screaming and flailing about, Anna's r ight arm r e t u r ned t o n o r m al . B r e uer an d Freud were later to call this mental reliving of a situation out of th e past an ab reaction. The physical expression of emotion was called catharsis. These terms have since been used interchangeably by psychoanalysts, but strictly speaking there is a mind (abreaction ) versus body (catharsis ) issue involved here.' Now Breuer was a conventional medical theorist, who favored Briicke's approach to science. He saw illness as being due to h ereditary- biological influences, as being brought on by purely biochemical processes. He suggested that Anna suffered from a hereditary disor- der which he called the hy pnoid state. He believed that some people are born with this t endency to \"split consciousness\" in a w a y that allows a set of ideas with strong emo- tional coloring to continue to in fl u ence be- havior outside of t h e p e r s on's self-control. F reud never r eally a ccepted thi s l i n e o f theory. In 1893 Breuer an d F r e u d c o a u thored Study' es on Hysteria (V' olume II ), in which they presented various cases of hysteria and two theories of its etiology (causes ). Freud was finding in h i s p r a ctice that i n v ariably there was some unknown (by the patient ) reason for the splitting of consciousness. What h e saw at work w a s no t s i m pl y s ome i n - Personality Theory herited, automatic h y pnoid s t a te. R a t h er, there was what he termed a kind of d e fense hysteria, in which the person invariably re- jected a sexual implication in some behavior in question. As Freud's later case histories were to demonstrate, at least some of the emotion that Anna never expressed in relation to her father was lust. He would call this the Oedipal complex one day. Though he is polite enough in the St udies, accepting in t h e ory t hat hysteria may t ak e tw o f o r m s , F r e u d wryly observes: \" Strangely enough, I h a v e never in my own experience met with a gen- u ine hypnoid hysteria. Any t ha t I t o o k i n hand has turned into a defence hysteria.\"\" In thus turning his attention away from the strangulated affect to the stranguiator of the a Rect — the defensive counter t o w h a t e v er was trying t o r e ac h e x p ression in i t i ally- Freud made himself over into a new kind of physician. He was not only a h e aler, but a student of the workings of mind. Structural Constructs Dualism o f Mind versus Body Freudian psychology is a dualism, meaning that it builds on the assumption that th ere are two interacting spheres of behavior — the psyche ( mind) an d t h e soma (body), Briicke s science would explain everything in terms of bodily constructs, thereby reducing mental to physical processes. Freud began with a preference for theorizing about peo- ple the way his beloved professor wanted, and he received additional promptings in this direction from both B r e uer an d F l i e ss. In f act, he once started but di d n o t fi n i s h a"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"44 M i xed Kantian-Lockean Models in Classical Psychoanalysis Part I theory of p sychology based exclusively on biology (a monism ), but he found after a few m onths that h e s i m pl y c o ul d n o t fi t t h i s mechanistic view of behavior to hi s u n d er- standing of a b n o r ma l b e h a vior (see the project \" ). Freud later said that physical ex- planations were useless for the proper under- standing of the psychological side of human behavior.\" Even though he r elied less and less on physicomedical models of h u ma n b e havior and turned to the writings of anthropologists, a rchaeologists, and sociologists for u n d e r - standing, Freud continued to admit and even to stress a necessary tie-in of purely biological f actors to human behavior.\" T h er e i s d i s - agreement among those who h ave studied Freud as to his actual reliance on biological or physical explanation. Since he always kept the door open to such explanations, we can- not claim that he was a purely psychological theorist. Yet his theory, including its energy conceptions, was always kept exclusively in the realm of the psyche once the body-mind dualism had been br i dged by t h e i n s t i n ct construct (see below ). r ecall of a m e m or y o u t o f t h e p a s t t h a t was still active in mind, but in a d e e per re- g ion outside of aw areness. What i s m o r e , these were almost always memories of a sex- ual or hostile nature. Figure 3 p r o vides us ~»<h a schematization of Freud's early men- t al structural constructs. Note th e s t y l i z ed d otted arc, moving an a r ro w f r o m l e f t t o right across points 1 through 9, both or i gi- nating and ending in the external world. This arc traces a perception that might be taken in at point 1 through an action at point 9 that the person might perform in relation to what was perceived. For example, the person might see a water fountain (point 1), and as- suming that all went well through the mind, would end up at the fountain, taking a drink to satisfy thirst (point 9). This scheme is ac- tually based on the reflex-arc concept, which was a popular style of explanation in 1900 w hen Freud framed this model.\" T h e i m - portant thing to remember, however, is that Figure 3 is a model of mind. Reflexes are bio- l ogical units, built i n t o t h e b o d y (soma). H ence, in fr aming t h i s m o de l F r eu d w a s analogizing to the body but he was referring exclusively to mind. If we now follow a men- tal perception (stimulus ) frorii it s en try at point 1, note that it passes through conscious- ness into the second region of preconscious- ness and down into the lowest level of mind, t he unconscious, before returning u p w a r d a gain through points 7 an d 8 (censorship points ) and i ssuing i n t o m otor action a t point 9. Freud defined consciousness as a \"sense organ for the apprehension of psychical qual- ities,\" \" through w hich the i n d i v i d ual i s a ware of sensory in put (seeing, smelling, thinking about things seen ) and also of pleas- urable or painful experiences. Consciousness does not rule the mind in Fre udian psychol- ogy. It does not even retain memories, which are kept down below the level of conscious awareness.

He broke down the sphere of mind in- to three regions: conscious, unconscious, and preconscious In order to appr.eciate why he did this, we will have to consider what is actually a motivational construct, the censorship, for it is this mechanism of defense that plays the role of strangulator in F r e u d's first m o del.

In its general sense, unconsci ous merely meant all those psychic contents like thoughts, ideas, and images that are not c o nscious at the moment but might become so at any time (he sometimes included preconscious contents in this general usage ) .\" More specifically, however, Freud considered the un conscious to be an actual region of mind, one that was m uch larger t ha n c o n sciousness and t h at lived a mental life of its own. Th e an alogy of an iceberg is often drawn. The portion we see above the water line is merely the tip of resistance or not."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"46 M i xed Kantian-Lockean Models in Classical Psychoanalysis Part I can do so directly — that is, in a waking state — by way of what Freud called unconscious derivatives.\" W e c a n u s e t h e e x a m p le o f Anna's snake and the death heads she saw on her fingers. These hallucinated (imagined ) derivatives were communicating something that Anna did not want to admit consciously — possibly a wish that her father would die! Before something this dramatic takes place there has to be a long period of censorship. Sometimes when t h e u n c o n s cious breaks t hrough like this i n t h e w a k i n g s t a te, th e person may be astonished by th e i l l o g ical things that take place. The unconscious does not worry about logic and often wants both to have its cake and to eat it t o o. \" P e o ple with severe mental illness may feel they have been possessed by a devil who forces them to do strange things. A less dramatic possibility in the waking state occurs when two people actually communicate at a completely uncon- scious level.\" Freud believed that two people could be relating at one level in c o nscious- n ess and yet abo be relating in t h ei r m a n - n erisrns and bodily p o s t ures a t a t o t a l l y different level outside of awareness. For ex- ample, two men may talk business consciously and yet carry on an unconscious homosexual Hirtation at the same time. Since emotions are revealed to us through c onsciousness, is it correct to s p eak o f u n - conscious emotions > Strictly speaking, Freud would say no. There are no unconscious emo- tions per se, but there are unconscious ideas t hat in t h e m selves relate t o e m o t i o ns. I f these ideas begin to traverse our dotted arc in Figure 3 and t h r eaten to seek motor ac- tion, then conscious awareness would reRect an emerging emotion t o t h e p e r s onality.\" Assume that a person has an unconscious de- sire to kill a l o ved on e (a seeming contra- diction, but remember: the unconscious is not logical. ). As this idea drifts forward in mind from point 6 to point 7 and especially 8, con- siderable emotion is generated because it is t he iceberg; the vast majority is below t h e water line. Consciousness is like the tip of an iceberg, and unconsciousness is the vast area below. We c a n n e v e r a p p r e ciate psycho- analysis if we fail to u n d erstand the impor- t ance of th e u n c onscious to b e havior. A s Freud observed, \"the unconscious is a par- ticular realm of the mind with its own wish- ful impulses, its own mode of expression and its peculiar mental mechanisms which ar e n ot in force elsewhere.\"\" W e ca n o nl y g e t in touch with the unconscious by interpret- i ng what it s e ems to be i n d i cating in o u r dreams, waking f a n t a sies, \"slips of the tongue,\" and so on.\" Freud accepted Darwinian theory, which holds that human beings have evolved from lower animal forms. Freud believed that the u nconscious was more i n t o u c h w i t h t h i s basic animalistic nature than was conscious- ness. We are all m ore p r i m i t ive as uncon- scious identities. Unconscious ideas are totally hedonistic, which means they are aimed solely a t providing p l e asure fo r t h e i n d i v i d u a l . C onsciousness has to take reality i nt o c o n - sideration, and hence it is more oriented to the needs of others. The unconscious \"never forgets\" because it literally does not weaken its hold on ideas over the passage of time.\" What we call forgetting is actually the disap- pearance of conscious ideas into the uncon- scious, where they remain perfectly clear for all time. Indeed, every person now alive car- ries around in the unconscious a memory of everything that ever happened to him or her. What is more, these memories can form into a body of ideas having complete autonomy and independence from the typical style of thinking in consciousness.

The primary point of censorship occurs at the region between un- consciousness and preconsciousness. As long as a mental content (idea, image ) is held be- low this level, there is no threat to the per- sonality. This would be a basic strangulation. But if we m ove up no w t o t h e r e g io n b e- tween consciousness and p r e c onsciousness (point 8 ), here is where severe threat arises, for the person might now b e p r o m p ted to act out his or h e r u n c o n scious ideas.\" In other words, Freud's model assumes that if mental contents get into consciousness, they ttill be carried out, or at l e ast the in t e nt o f the idea will be known.

This is clearly a Freudian addition to the reflex-arc concept, because our bodily r e flex arcs — as witnessed in the action of the patellar knee tap — always move in the progressive direction (stimulus to response ) . In proposing a r e - versal to this direction, Freud was trying to account for th e f a c t t h a t s o m e t i mes i d eas originating in t h e u n c o nscious are experi- enced by the individual as literal stimuli in the environment — as visions or h a l l u c ina- tions (seeing, feeling, smelling things that do not exist ). Anna's snake and death's heads reflected such a regression of an unconscious image moving in the r everse direction. She t errifying to think t hat one w o uld w an t t o h urt a beloved person. It i s t h e i d e a t h a t causes the emotion here, and what we censor in holding back p o t entially emotional cir- c umstances is always a mental and no t a n emotional factor in our mind. Another often-raised issue concerns the possibility of unconscious ideas coming down to us from our ev olutionary ancestors. Did Freud think of the unconscious only as a re- ceptacle for ideas or images fed into the mind f rom external reality and t he n k ep t f r o m conscious awareness by the censor t Although this was surely his major emphasis, the truth is that Freud was influenced on this point by his famous associate C. G. Jung (see Chap- ter 3 ) and held open the possibility of hered- i tary transmission of psychic contents.\" I f human beings were to receive mental influ- ences from racial heredity, then such ideas or i mages would make t h emselves known i n the unconscious (by way of the id \" ) . To account for that region of unawareness over which we often do have some control, Freud proposed the term preconscious. The preconscious region i s made up o f c o n t r i - butions from both the conscious and the un- conscious, and it is the area of mind w h e re censorship takes place.\" The conscious and unconscious never communicate directly, but only by way of this intermediate level of pre- consciousness. When we f o r get s omething l ike the telephone number of a f r i end on l y to recall it after an e f f ort o f c o n centration, we have dealt exclusively with a preconscious content. Since the telephone number returns to our consciousness in time (an unconscious psychic content like a death wish would not do this ), we can refer to the forgotten num- ber as unconscious only in that general sense to which we referred above.

In order to maintain a continuity with o ur discussion above, assume that we h a v e placed the egg-shaped structure of Figure 4 as a transparent template over the levels of m ind of Figure 3. Note that now ou r c o m - bined schematization has an id (completely in the unconscious region ), an ego, and a superego stretching across all three levels, and an area of repressed content at about the spot of our primary censorship.

The i d i n everyone is greedy, envious, and thoroughly selfish.

Other definitions of the ego used by Freud were a \"dominant mass of ideas\"\" and a \"coherent organization of mental pro- cesses.\" ' W e see Freud's D a r w i n ianism emerging in his theory once again. That is, he assumed that what is first or earliest on the scene in life is basic to and determinative of all that is to f o l l ow. T h us, since the ego develops from the id, the id is primary; and an ego would not evolve if this ego did not f urther the hedonistic goals of the id . W e must never forget that the ego wants to get t he same pleasurable things out of l if e t h a t the id wants. They diRer only over the means to the ends sought. As Freud said, \"the ego stands for reason and good sense while the id stands for the untamed passions.\"\" Freud also expressed this diRerence be- tween the id and the ego in terms of what he called the primary versus the secondary pro- cess in mind.\" The id, coming earlier in de- velopment, operates according to a primitive (primary) mental process, which seeks imme- diate gratification through what in F i g ure 3 we called progression to motor action or, if c hecked, resorts to r egression in o r de r t o hallucinate what is desired (see Figure 3 ). A baby might react in t his way du r ing t h e first weeks of life, grabbing out for whatever it wants or p o s sibly even h a l l ucinating a d esired mother s breast as if it w ere w i t h i n view when it is not. It is the ego's (second- ary ) process in reasoning that helps check in time these impulsive and make-believe ten- dencies in the child s behavior. The ego is that part of t h e p e r sonality that l e arns to cry and show signs of needing attention when t he mother is actually within v ie w o r p r e - sumed to be within earshot. But of course, in this process there is a lot o f i m m e d i ate gratification that goes unfulfilled as the baby matures. This checking of the id is, accord- i ng to Freud, the reason why m ost of o u r unconscious contents consist of u n s a tisfied wishes.\" In working out a proper strategy for need satisfaction, the ego must actually serve three masters: the id (which may lust and want to kill someone ), the demands of external reality (where society frowns on such acts of mur- der ), and the final identity of the topographi- cal model, the superego.\" We all realize that a certain \"voice within\" us — which we call our conscience — may well disturb us as we plan to do something w r o ng, even though n obody else may k no w a b ou t i t . I n 1 9 1 4 Freud said this \"judgment from within\" was due to a standard of how we ought to behave called the ego ideal \"W . h en he l a t er int r o - duced the id construct (1923), Freud referred to the ego ideal as the superego. He did not make any r ea l d i s t i n ction b e t w een t h e se terms, and we can v i e w t h e m a s s y n o ny- mous.\" The main point is that, as the id is organizing into the ego, a portion of this ego- organization is f o r m in g i n t o a s u p e r ego- that is, an identity point in mind t hat is ego but is also beyond or above it as a b u i l t-in Since the superego has developed from the same mental beginnings as the ego, it too is basically a product of the id.\" It is easy for us t o forget this, because the contents of t h e superego are often so clearly in opposition to the id.\" Th e i d w i s h es to t ak e something, even if it i s s t ealing. The superego wishes t hat the id would be punished for thi n k i n g such thoughts or for bringing them about if the person actually does steal. Rather than confronting th e i d d i r e c t ly , t h e s u p e r ego makes its wishes known to the ego. In some of Freud's writings it is clear that he thought t he id mi gh t e ven o ccasionally stir u p o r irritate the superego with extreme indecen- cies so that it will nag at the ego all the more. In this way, the id can sometimes get back at the ego if too many repressions are being put ideal."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 The Beginnings of Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud 51 on the personality. These \"negotiations\" be- tween id, ego, and superego take place in the region of mind k n ow n a s th e u n c onscious. The ego unfortunately always ends up as the one in the middle, having to restore harmony in the personality while keeping \"one eye\" open to reality considerations. The superego is just as unbending and un- reasonable as the id. It has, like the id, re- ceived a kind of inheritance from the past in the sense of ethicomoral principles (like the Ten Commandments ). It sticks to these rigidly and can never see exceptions to the rule. The id s inheritance is physical and hedonistic, and the superego's is sociocultural, but both of these identities in mind tr y t o d i c t ate to t he ego.

Motivational Constructs Instinct and Energy Freud did not make much use of an instinct construct in his earliest writings. It was not until about 1905, following his major work on dreams, that he began employing the in- s tincts as a major theoretical tool.\" By t h a t t ime Freud wa s b e g i n ning t o a t t r ac t c o l - l eagues and students who me t w i t h h i m weekly at his home, a group that became in 1906 the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society.' T hese discussions w i t h c o l l e a g ues h a d brought up the question of the relation be- tween mind (psyche) and body (soma ). Freud found that the instinct construct could help him here, and he eventually made three definite points concerning instincts: (1) they a re based on a s t i m u l a t ion t a k in g p l a c e w ithin the b od y an d n o t i n t h e e x t e r n a l world; (2) they provide a constant level of s timulation that w e c a nnot ru n a w a y f r o m as we can run away from pressing stimula- tions (like cold or heat ) in our external en- v ironment;\" a n d (3) they seem always to function \"on the frontier between the mental a nd the s o m a t i c,\" \" a c t i n g t h e r e f or e a s bridges between the mind and body. Figure 5 s chematizes this bridge function of th e i n - stinct, originating in the body but leading to the mind; it also lists the four characteristics that Freud attributed to any instinct (source, aim, pressure, object ). E ach instinct is said to have the aim o f satisfaction, or removing the pressure (exten'. of stimulation ) from its source (the point in t he internal body area from w h ich i t o r i g i - nates ). If we h ave a g r eat need fo r s ome- thing, a given instinctual stimulus is exerting great pressure on us with the aim of achieving satisfaction, and the particular nature of th e instinct (let us say it is to eat when hungry ) determines just how we act (look for some- thing to eat ). Now, \"the thing in regard to which the instinct is able to achieve its aim\" is the object.\" This is a widely used technical term in psychoanalysis which can refer to a person, an item of food, or a general desired person. Literally anything t h at m i g h t c o n - ceivably lead to the satisfaction of an instinct is an object. The instinct theory is also a different way of talking about hedonism. Pleasure consists in removing the pressure of an i n s t i n ctive prompting in th e b o dy. Re-establishing the harmony of the body and keeping all tension at a low level is known in biology as homeo- stasis. Freud's concept of pleasure is there- f ore a homeostatic construct.

For various rea- sons, this total balance is never achieved and so we have our varying weather patterns.

Now in every individual there exists a tendency to diminish this sum of excitation once more, in order to preserve his health.\"\" In other words, just as a high pressure point in the atmosphere presses outward to dissi- pate itself into low pressure areas, so too do the excitations of th e n e rvous system press outward to re-establish an even level of sensa- tion (nervous impulses ) throughout this bodily system. If, for some reason, this sum of excitation is not run oR and a homeostasis achieved, then there would be trouble devel- oping. Anna's pathognomic situation was a \"sum of excitation\" (in memory ) like this that never quite go t r e l eased (or worked over ) and therefore resulted in her hysterical s ymptoms. The manner in wh ich the m i n d succeeds — however effectively — in ridding it- self of these states of heightened excitation is called the vict'ssitudes of the instincts.\" A vicissitude is a regular or i r r egular state of change in something (like the weather! ), and this is the pattern of change we see in our instinctive promptings as we get hungry and eat, only to get h u n gry again and eat once more. Sexual in stincts are somewhat more difficult to satisfy. Most psychologists would define motiva tion as the \"activation of behavior due to a need deficit in relation to a g o al (object ).\" Freud's object w as usually an i t em in t h e person's experience that could satisfy such a need, but the aim of i n s t i nctual satisfaction FreuZs Promethean Insight: The Sexual Instinct Freud's lifelong conviction was that he had found the basic reason for all n e uroses, as w ell as the major m o t ivator o f a l l h u m a n behavior, in th e h u ma n b e i n g' s sexual in - about the use of the term sex in his theory.

Despite this multiplicity of instincts in his theory, Freud gave a name to only one energy in mind, so that whenever he would d escribe a patient's behavior based on h i s structural model (id, ego, superego ), he would frame the description exclusively in t erms of t hi s s i n gl e m e n ta l e n e r gy. T h i s energy was called libido, and it was defined variously as \"psychical desire,\"\" a l l o f t h e person's \"erotic tendencies,\"\" \"sexual desire i n the broadest sense,\"\" an d \" t h e m o t i v e f orces of sexual l i f e.\" \" B u t p r o b a bl y t h e m ost complete statement of l i b i d o i n h i s writings, and one that also gives us a good picture of Freud's use of Love, may be found in the following quote: L i bid'o is a n e x p r ession t a ( en fr o m the theory o f the emotions.

The term autoerotic means that t he p e r s on u s es the instinctual source of pleasure (mouth area, penis, and so on ) as the object of pleasure. This gaining of p l e asure from a r eas other than the genital regions of the body is some- times referred t o a s or g a n p l e a s ure, b u t Freud was quick to point out that the reason various organs have p l easure attached to t hem is because they satisfy a s e xual i n - stinct.

With an energy this all-encompassing there was probably no need for n a m in g a l t erna- tives. Nevertheless, since there are other in- s tincts than th e s e x u al, on e w o u l d h a v e thought that Freud m i gh t h av e n amed an energy for at least one more such instinct. The fact that he never did is mute testimony that he continued to base his major motiva- tional theories on sexual factors in the human personality. One of the most common errors made in studying Freud is to equate libido with emotion, with th e \" g oo d f e eling\" ex - p erienced in genital release and so on. A s noted above, since emotions are not directly \"in mind\" any m ore t han the pain we feel w hen we stub ou r t oe s i s \" i n m i n d , \" t h e mental energy known as libido is not directly comparable to feelings or emotions. Emotions are rooted in the body and are made known to us mentally. We are aware of the pain of a stubbed toe, but we do not equate our aware- n ess with the l o cus of o u r p a i n (the toe area ). In like fashion, sexual pleasures emanate from the genital region of the body and are t he mind, orienting b ehavior i n t e r m s o f these bodily based needs yet separate and distinct from them as well. Libido is the psychic energy of the sexual instincts, and Freud now required an addi- tional term to describe how this worked, how it oriented the person to seek a sexually de- s irable object. The term h e settled on w a s cathexi~. Freud first u s ed t h is c o nstruct in his Project (see p. 44) as a physical concept, and noting his o r i g inal u sage helps us to understand what he means in his later psy- chological theorizing. In the Pr o ject, Freud said that a physical neurone (which is a \"cell\" in the nervous system ) was cathected' when it was filled with a certain quantum of phys- when a \"sum of e x citation\" i s i n c reased is ical energy.\" This is related to the principle of neuronic inertia, because what happens t hat a n e u r o n e \"fills up\" with physical energy (see p. 53 for discussion of neuronic inertia ) . This idea of filling up or occupying some- thing is what Freud retained when he later used cathexis in relation to libido as a mental e nergy. Thus, if a man w ere to f al l i n l o v e w ith a woman, he would mentally \"fill\" h e r i mage in h i s m i n d s e y e w i t h l i b i d o ! \" Cathexis now has the meaning of a thrust, an entering, an occupation of a mental image, or a fixing of interest on some driven ob/'ect by a ttaching libido to i t o r e n g u l f i n g i t w i t h libidinal energies.\" M o t i ve s ar e t h e r e f ore concerned with the libidinal cathexis of this or that object. The next step is to attain the cathected object (in o ur example, for t h e m an to win t h e w o m a n's l ov e i n r e t u r n ). However, simply cathecting an o bject does not mean the individual will a l w ays seek to a ttain it in th e e x ternal wor l d (that is, ex- ternal to the contents of mind ). For example, if the id lusts for some object — let us assume it is a parent — then the ego can anticathect this investment of libido in the image of the p arent by opposing its own supply of li b i do to the id's cathexis.\" Anticathexis, therefore, is another way of talking about strangulation, censorship, or repression. One last point must be m ade concerning Freud's views on sex. He always held to the position that h u m ans w ere bi s e xual.

Th e fi r s t q u e s t io n t h a t arises is, just how many instincts are in the human animal> Freud believed that this was unknown and that the only way the question could be answered was to study the problem e mpirically by tracing each instinct in t u r n to its ul t i m ate source i n t h e b o d y .\" T h e problem here, Freud noted, was that one is tempted to think u p t o o m a n y i n s t incts to describe behavior. For example, to ex plain playfulness, we might p r o pose that hum a n b eings have an instinct to p l ay. Y et, if w e w ere to break t hi s a c t ivity d ow n i n t o i t s c omponents, we might fin d t h a t a n u n d e r - l ying instinct entered into t h i s a c t i v ity i n combination with one or possibly two other more basic instincts, so that playfulness was s uggested that we p r obably need t h in k o f only a small number of underlying instincts to explain all kinds of behavior at more com- plex levels. Freud called t hese underlying i n s t i ncts primal instincts, and the instincts made up of these he called compound instincts. Now, it is very important to keep in mind t h at, as a general theoretical strategy, Freud tvas altvays to base psychoanalytical theory on the inter play of tuo primal instincts, even though he i mplied that more than ttvo were in e ffect. H e changed the names of these primal in - stincts over the years, but the f u n d amental o pposition of tw o b a sic f o rces in t h e p e r - sonality remains constant in Freudian thought. In fact, Freud maintained that instincts oc- curred in pairs of opposites, usually — as we have seen in the case of bisexuality — taking an active and a passive opposition.\" Freud's first opposition of i n s t i n cts w as that of the sel f preservative in-st incts (or ego instincts\" ) and the sexual instincts (or ob- ject instincts\" ).

With f u r t h e r e x p erience and some challenges on certain points from his critics, Freud was eventually to change his theory of instincts. In place of self-preservation, he introduced the construct of a death instinct. This addition was part of a m asterful piece of theorizing, and the way in w h ich he ac> complished it was to hase the Death-Instinct theory on two preliminary ideas: narcissism and the repetition compulsion. We will work o ur way into t hi s change by way o f t h e se preliminary constructs. Narcissism In G r e e k m y t h ., Narcissus, the beautiful son of the river-god Cephissus, was supposedly the embodiment of s e lf-conceit. Many nymphs wanted to be his lover, but he rejected their flirtations. One such rejected m aiden prayed to the d eity t hat h e m i g h t know what it meant to love and not be loved in return. A curse was put on his head and one day, leaning over a river bank for a drink of w a t er, N a r cissus was doomed to fall in love with his own reflection.

Problems were mounting be- cause of the challenges of his detractors, some 'of whom — like Adler — wanted Freud to give a more central role in the personality to con- scious, reasonable, ego functions. Others — like Jung — felt that he was redefining the mean- ing of libido, making it into an elan vital, a general life force subsuming sexuality and many other functions as well.\" W ha t F r eud h ad to do w a s (I) explain ego functions (self-preservation ) as a special case of th e sexual instincts, yet ( 2) avoid m ak ing t h e sexual instinct the on ly p r i m a l i n s t i n ct o f his theory.

I t was as i f t h e y w e r e w o r k i n g t h r o u g h some anxious concern that preoccupied them, like the mystery of birth i n t h e i r h i d e-and- go-seek amusements. There ar e r e p e t itive dreams and repetitive fantasies that every- one experiences occasionally, and even his- torians have noted that history tends to re- peat itself. B asing his a r g u m ent o n s u c h p o i n t s , Freud then concluded that in addition to the pleasure principle, \"there really does exist in the m i n d a c o m p u l s io n t o r e p e a t.\" \" Note that this is a mental principle, whereas, if we recall, Fliess's periodic cycle theory had s uggested something of the sort in th e b i o - l ogical realm. Freud no w b r i n g s h i s t w o flnal primal principles together by a stroke o f genius t ha t t i e s t h e m b o t h b a c k t o Brucke's constancy idea. He o b serves that \"an instinct i s an u r ge i n h e r e nt in o r g a n i c Life to restore an earLier state o f things which the living entity has been obliged to abandon under the p r essure of e x t e rnal d i s t urbing forces; that is, it is a k i n d o f o r g a ni c elas- ticity, or to put it another way, the expression of the inertia i n h erent i n o r g a n i c l i f e.\" \" Instincts do not make new things happen so m uch as they c ause th ings h a p pening t o return to an e a r lier state (the conservative nature of instincts ) .

If w e c o n s i der t h e i s s u e b i o l o g i cally, even physical matter has a way of returning to a common inorganic state, as the Biblical reference of \"dust to dust\" reminds us.

This collective name is the Death 1nstinct (Freud did not like the term T h anatos, which some of his advocates have used since ).

A s when h e s e emed t o b e i d e n t i f y i n g libido with pleasure (see p. 54), Freud here a gain seems to be i d e n t ifying d eath w i t h (pleasurable ) satisfaction. He referred to this u ltimate reduction in t e n sion i nt o th e q u i - escence of death as the Nirvana principle,\" but for all practical purposes as a theoretical device this is nothing more than a rephrase of the constancy principle and identical to the pleasure principle in a theoretically tech- n ical sense. Thus, in his final theory of i n - stincts, Freud has Eros and Death as the two p rimary instincts entering together into a l l kinds of secondary or c o m p onent i n stincts found in the 'personality (that is, the inter- actions of id, ego, and superego ). This was sometimes called a fusion of instincts.\" For example, sadism (receiving pleasure from inflicting pain on others ) would be termed a component instinct in which there has been a fusion of hostility (Death) and sex (Eros).\" Even something as simple as looking out for one's self, being willing to fight i f n e cessary to retain one's integrity as a person, could be seen as a fu sion o f s e l f - l ove (Eros) and hostility (Death ). In fact, Fr eud once said that the Life and Death Instincts hardly ever a ppear in their p u r e f o r m i n h u m a n b e - havior; there is almost always some fusion of the two.\" We might finally ask, since Freud named l ibido as the energy of E r o s i n t h i s fi n a l f ormulation of hi s i n s t i nct t h e ory, di d h e ever name an energy in opposition to it ~ No, this was never to be the case.

There are actually two stages in repression (Freud's dichotomizing tendency again; see p. 46). The first, or primal r e pression, takes p lace during the tim e o f t h e o r i g i na l c o n - f lict between ideas. Thi s r e s u lts i n w h a t Freud called a fixation, a mental mechanism that we wil l t a k e u p i n t h e n e x t s e c t i on, which deals with the stages of psychosexual development. Then later, when certain mental derivatives (vague recollections or symbolical manifestations like A n n a' s d e a t h' s h e ads; see p. 43 ) begin s lipping hy t h e p r i m a l censorship (repression ), a repression proper is carried on hy the mind. This has to be kept up, and it proves taxing to the mind. Displacement. Fr e ud i n t r o d u c ed di s p lace ment to describe how it is possible to fool the censor and, in a dream formulation, to di s- place the true meaning of a d r eam content o nto an unrelated event or happening.\"' I f w e have an u n c o n scious hatred f o r o u r brother, for example, we might displace this hatred in our dream onto a bobcat, which we track down and kill a f ter a satisfying hunt. We never actually realize consciously that o ur victim is B ob, w h ic h i s s h or t f o r o u r brother's name, Robert. U n c onsciously we have killed our brother, but consciously only an unconscious derivative symbolized by a game animal has been done in. Substitution. Hu m a ns can often find a l t e r - nate objects in life. We can redirect our in- terests, for example, and find a new libidinal o bject if we ar e b l ocked f r o m g e t t ing o u r first sexual preference. Freud suggested that when an aging unmarried woman dotes over a pet dog, or when an old bachelor collects snuB boxes, the former has found a substitute for the marital partner she never acquired, and the latter ha s substituted a s e r ies of pretty boxes for the succession of beautiful simply ad>ustment or me n t al m e c h anisms. They are often defined in t e rm s of e n ergy e xpenditure, the b l ocking o r r e r o u t in g o f mental energies, and so forth. However, there is a clear m e a ning f o r e a c h m e c h a nism, which is easily grasped by anyone who lacks knowledge of libido theory. Repression. We have already introduced this construct as the historical descendant of the strangulator and the censorship. Repression was Freud's most basic mental mechanism on which all o f t h e o t h e r m e chanisms are predicated. As Freud said, repression is \"the corner-stone on which the whole structure of p sycho-analysis rests.\" \"' W e c a n d e f i n e repression in two ways: (I) it is a countering of one cathexis by an anticathexis, or (2) it i s the opposing of one idea in m in d b y a n opposing idea. These are two ways of saying t he same thing. W e r e a ll y c a n not u n d e r - stand why one energy cathexis is opposed b y a countercathexis without k n o w ing t h e content of the ideas.

The cited definition makes it appear that a person can- not sublimate hostility or the Death Instinct.

If the proper amount of psychic energy does not move up from level A (ages 8 to 10 ) to level B (ages 13 to 17 ), then \"the excitation is dealt with i n a c c ordance with the psychological laws in force in the earlier psychical period and along th e p a ths open a t that ti me.

A fuero is thus a claim on th e h ea d o f s t a te for privileges. In like fashion, said Freud, we have per- sonal fueros that dictate to us from out of our own past (recall that the unconscious is timeless! ). They arise when we do not pass smoothly through one d evelopmental stage to another. A primal repression at one stage will surely mean that a fuero has been estab- lished there, forever afterward p l acing de- mands on the personality structure to — in a sense — return and resolve the issue that led to the conflict of cathexis and countercathexis.

Freud was to drop his first model of four levels in mind, and over the years we can actually count six o r s e ve n s t ages (some- times called phases ) in the development of t he human being f ro m b i r t h t o m a t u r i t y . However, the first four, which are called the pregenital stages, are the most important in personality formation. Freud meant by geni t aL the capacity to reproduce, so that p r e- genital levels are those in w h i ch, although sexuality is active, the genital (procreative ) potential is not yet realized and no offspring can result fro m s e xual i n t e rcourse. These p sychosexual stages, to which we now t u r n , should not be thought of as fixed rigidly to a ge level.

The child in the first few months of life is said to be in a st ate of pr i m a ry n a rcissism (autoerotic ), living only on th e basis of the pleasure principle. If a bodily tension arises, the infant removes it automatically through internal reflex actions like urination or def- e cation. But if i n o r d e r t o r e m o v e th e t e n - sion some external object is necessary — like m other's breast — the child c a n r e s o r t t o ~ish fuL jLLment and literally s ee (that is, hallucinate ) what he or she desires in an act of fantasy (primary process thought ). Wish fulfillments through fantasy are identical to the mechanisms of dream formation (both f ollow the m odel p r esented in F i g u r e 3 ). Since there are no superego wishes to be met with this early in life, the wish fulfillments of a baby in the oral stage are aLL pleasant.\"' Gradually, the taking-in tendencies of the oral stage bring about identi /cation, a mental- mechanism process that i s n o t c o m p l e ted until the phallic stage of development (as we discuss later in this chapter ). To identify is to take over the behavioral styles, attitudes, and belief systems of other p e ople as our more primitive mechanism than object choice. To choose an object means that the person has sent libidinal cathexes outward, away f rom the self-identity. But to i d e n t ify i s t o send libido inward, forming the internal life of the psyche in what is essentially a narcis- s istic way.

In fact, Freud first referred to the personality in this phase as the \"saa'istic anal -organization, i n w h i c h the anal zone a nd t h e c o m p o n e nt i n s t i nct of sadism are p a r t i c ularly p r o m i n e n t.\" \"' Sadism involves taking (sexual ) pleasure from the inffiction of pain (see p. 59). The anal stage is still pregenital; but as t he child i s t o i l e t-trained by t h e m o t h e r , there is an ever-increasing source of potential difficulty in the clash of wills, both individuals desiring to fulfill their own ends. The child finds that the mucous membranes of the anal r egion are a source of pleasure and mi g ht e ven physically manipulate thi s r e g io n o r p lay with f e cal m a t t er through retention, then rapid expulsion in d e f ecation, and so forth.

Ana/ Psychosexual Stage Sometime around the close of the first year of life, when the child is first confronted with t he need to m ee t t h e d e m a nd s o f p o l i t e society and learn to control his or her sphinc- ters (urination, defecation ), Freud v i ewed a shift in erotogenic zones from the mouth area to the anus (and also to the ur ethra, our next stage ). Whereas experience up to t his time had allowed the child t o t ak e i n (introject, incorporate ), he o r she is n o w called upon t o d e l a y c e r t ain g r a tifications (secondary process in thought ), to live more along the lines of a reality principle. By this time the ego is being diRerentiated out of the mass that was the oceanic total of psy- c hic events, and as such th e eg o i s c o n - fronted with certain problems in living. Freud said that when an i n s t inct i s no t s a tisfied, the person experiences a frustration; t h e r ules and restrictions put on t h e c h i l d b y parents that cause this frustration he called a prohibition; and the resulting psychological state of affairs in general he called a priva ti on.\"' T h e a n a l s t a g e b e g i ns a l i f e l o n g process of having to put up w it h p r i v a tions and trying to live up to th e p r o hibitions of one's elders, who ul t i m ately r epresent the values of the broader culture.

Basing his main argument on Darwin's theory of a primal horde, he argued that in the dawn of human society people lived in small groups u nder the complete dominance of a s i n g l e m ale. This \"primal father\" owned all of th e h orde's property, and th e w o m e n o f t h e group were his most prized possessions for they brought him sexual pleasure. He had unlimited power and exerted it sadistically, keeping all of his sons from the pleasures of sexual contact with the women in the group (privation ). If a son violated this prohibition, the father would either kill, castrate, or send him oR into the wilderness to fend for him- self. This naturally led t o t h e p r a c t ice of exogamy (seeking sexual objects as mates froxn outside one's kinship group ), as the sons raided other g r o up s an d k i d n a p p ed However, one group of s on s eventually violated this pattern. A number of them who h ad been run oR b y t h e p r i m a l f a t her r e - turned as a smaller group of attackers with a common hatred. They were fearful of the old man, but through the strength of their num- bers they succeeded in killing him oR. Then, as many primitive groups are known to have done, they literally incorporated his physical identity. They ate him (or a goodly portion of him ) in cannibalistic fashion, just as the b aby now eats mother's mil k i n t h e o r a l stage. The reason for eating the father was t hat they hoped to take in o r i n t r o j ect h i s s trength. We might say that in k i l l in g h i m t he sons cathected their father's body wit h t he energy of the D e ath I n stinct, but t h ey also cathected him with libido in desiring his power. Hence, rather than taking him as a sexual object (object choice ), they reverted to the more primitive identi fication (incor- poration ) in the naxcissistic oral fashion that we have already discussed.\"' The shock of having killed and eaten the o ld man sobered the s ons u p e n o ug h t o r ealize that hostility breeds a return in ki n d a nd that no one profits if t h e k i l l i n g c o n - tinues. Hence, they succeeded in doing what the primal fathex could not b r i n g h i m s e lf to do: they struck a rational bargain (some- times called a social contract ). They agreed to found what we now t h in k of ' as families within the society, to have sexual intercourse with only their specific group of wi v es (this was a polygamous society ), and that th e ir sons s hould limit t h e ir s e l ection of w i v e s from outside the family (taboo of exogamy ). Hence, sons and daughters could not prop- erly expect to have sexual gratification (Eros) within their own family units. As the genera- t ions slipped by, t h e m e m o r y o f h a v i n g killed an actual human being was repressed, and the father's image was replaced by a totemic animal of some sort. Ordinarily, the animal could not be eaten except on certain ceremonial occasions, such as that of a sacri- f ice to God. An d t h i s no w h e a v enly G o d- i mage was also a projection of th e p r i m a l father. Religious myths were then t h o ught up to change the meaning of e a rl y events in the history of society. For example, the t rue original sin wa s no t v i o l a t in g o r d e r s f rom God about whether or no t t o e a t c e r - tain fruit; the true sin was killing the primal father (God) in order to get th e f o r b i dden fruits of sexuality.\"' With a common totemic a nimal and a c o m mo n G o d , t h e f a m i l i e s t hat were organized into a c u l t u r e (com- monly identified with a leader ) would drain o R hostility stimulated w i t hi n t h e g x o u p (Death Instinct ) by directing it o u t w ard i n wars on other societies that also had evolved in the manner we have outlined.\"' T o weld t hi s s ocial t h eory t o a s i n g l e family, F reud now o n c e a g ai n d r e w o n their own women."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"T he Beginnings of Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud 6 7 Ghapter 1 G reek mythology in t h e t a l e o f O e d i p u s . This famous myth r un s as f o l l ows: L a i u s, king of Thebes, having been warned by the oracle that his newborn son would destroy him, had the child sent oR to be mu rdered by a herdsman. Emotional ly unable to kill the child, the herdsman merely pierced his the elements. However, a shepherd rescued the boy and carried him t o a n o ther region where he was reared by a noble family, who named him Oedipus which means \"swollen foot\" (the foot is a penis symbol in Freudian thought ). In time, as he grew to m anhood, Oedipus was to hear from the oracle that he would someday slay his father. Thinking his stepfather was his natural father, he left the region by chariot only to m eet L a ius on a narrow road. After a disagreement over the r ight of w ay, O edipus unknowingly k i l l e d his real father. Later, thanks to the heroic act of solving the riddle of the Sphinx, Oedipus was made king of Thebes and thereby took Jocasta, his mother, as wifely queen. Years passed, and eventually the oracle made known the true relationship of mother and son to the two priniciples of our drama.

In t he c ase of the boy, along about his third year of life in the phallic stage, we find a re-enactment (repeti- tion ) of the primordial lusting for the female in the home (the mother ). The boy senses pleasurable stimulations from his penis eroto- genic zone, and he also has some hunch that this region is tied to m o t her i n a p h y s ical way. Thus, said Freud, \" . .. he becomes his mother's lover.

Many F r eudians use this framework today and say that there is a hostile competitiveness between the maturing girl and the mother over who w ill re a lly be the father's genital partner.

The period heralds the onset of genitality — true reproduction is now possible — and when this transformation in the body is completed, humans enter the adolescent p eriod, which is u sually considered to f a l l between the ages of twelve and twenty years. Primitive peoples often have puberty ri tes, which ceremonially introduce the child into adulthood with m uch f a n f are and r ecogni- tion.

The adolescent will thus fall in love — probably several times — and even- tually m a rr y o n e o f the s e h e t e r o sexual partners as he or she achieves adulthood. Most modern theorists who have studied the adolescent stress the latter's reliance on a peer group or gang. Although he did not address himself directly to th e q u e stion of adolescence, Freud did place great stress on the role of group factors in human behavior. Freud described the human being as \"a horde animal, an individual creature in a horde led b y a chief.\" \"' I n d e v e l o ping a g r o u p i n - terest, the adolescent is therefore merely re- flecting the in-group identification tendency that will be carried on for the rest of his or her life.

Freud therefore did not see a h omosexual adjustment as f u l l y a d u l t o r satisfactorily genital (see our discussion. be- l ow, p. 79). H e a l s o e m p hasized that t h e female's second' phase in the diphasic sexual d evelopment had t o b e a f e m i n i n e o n e , whereas initially she had been a \"little man.\" To accomplish this shift, th e g i r l ' s e r o t o- genic zone moves from the c l i t oris (\" little penis\" ) to th e v a g inal area proper, whi ch occurs during and f o l l owing p u bescence.\"' As this takes place the maturing woman be- comes increasingly passive (feminine ) and receptive to the sexual advances of the male, finding personal satisfaction in the penis of her lover and also in the bearing of a child. Freud realized that mere sexual activity would never bring happiness in adulthood. In his view, people who are \"sexually liber- ated\" a nd therefore promiscuous by c o n - ventional standards are also likely to be im- inature and narcissistic.

Freud therefore suggested that t o last, a mature love must consist of b o t h lustful desire and the aim-inhibited lust of \"feelings of aRection,\" like those we have for our parents during latency.\"' M a r r i ages are often begun under the original drive of lust, but in time a growing sense of affection (aim- inhibited lust ) partially r e p laces this ex- clusively sensual zeal. The marital partners say \"I not o nly l ov e m y m a te , I l i (e him (her).\" If only aim-inhibited ties of aRection are involved in the marriage (no lust ), then the love is platonic.

This trapping or pocketing of li bido dur- ing any given stage of psychosexual develop- ment is called fixation. Freud noted that the pathway to adulthood through th e p sycho- sexual stages is never w i t h ou t p r o b l ems- today we might call these hang-ups — and it is such frustrations that lead to a p sychical damming-up of libido.\"' S uch fi x a t ions can take place at an y p o i n t i n p s y c h o sexual d evelopment, and e v e n r e p e a t edly s o . \" ' Figure 6 presents a schematization of libido a s a \"river\" beginning it s Ho w a t t h e t o p from birth and continuing downward through the various psychosexual stages (which are mature, it is a good point at w h ich to con- sider this construct in more detail.

There are three pockets of fixated libido in Figure 6, because it is possible to have — and in most cases we all d o h a v e — more than one fixation point i n t h e s am e p ersonality. Usually, there is a major fixation (it is the oral stage in Figure 6 ), which lends coloring via fuero-claims to the personality, and then o thers provide secondary hues. N ot e a l s o that Figure 6 has two r i v ers of l i b i do, one labeled normal and the other abnorma/. The obvious diRerence is that in th e case of an abnormal sequence of fixations there is con- siderably more libido being fixated along the way (Freud's quantitative emphasis ) . This h eavy concentration of n o n fl o w i n g l i b i d o results in a narrowing of the abnormal river. Since this means that the personality struc- ture (id, ego, superego ) has less and less active hbido to use in current behavior, the a bnormal personality is d o o me d t o b r e a k down at some point. All o f t h e a b n o rmal's mental energy is being shunted oR to keep s omething that happened a l on g t i m e a g o enlivened at the unconscious level. Like an animal with in adequate food supplies or a machine without f u el, th e p e r son destined to be abnormal staggers and sputters along in life with a weak defensive system, a weak ego, and a lot of personal pressure from the i nternal fueros, which l i k e b i l l s of credit need to be met someday. Note also in Figure 6 that we have placed a large tributary coming into the main course o f libido, as when a s m a ller r i v e r j o i n s a larger one. This occurs at pubescence and is A baby receiving considerable oral gratifica- t ion in sensual sucking does not w an t t o move on to the demands of the anal stage when toilet-training comes on, and therefore fixates libido (builds a dam m e n tally! ) at the oral stage. A fuero is f r amed that says e ssentially \"But I d o n ' t w a n t t o l e a v e t h i s nice life. Let me be. Come back and let me focus on my sucking pleasures.\" The request to \"come back\" is being made to th e t o t al personality structure, so that even in ad ult- h ood a person fixated orally ha s t hi s u n - conscious desire to act o ut o r al n e e ds.

For ex- ample, the orally fixated adult might be fired f rom a jo b o r c o n f r on t a n u n h a pp y l o v e aRair. At such frustrating points in life, said F reud, as when a \"stream o f water . . . meets with an obstacle in the r i v er-bed,\" \"' there is a reversion of the flow back into old channels. W hen this h a p pens, all o f t h e f u e r o - complaints and claims may b e e n acted in behavior. The orally fixated man may go oR on a drinking binge, which regressively re- create the oral preoccupation (taking in ) of his major fixation point. A woman who cries easily and needs constant reassurance from her friends may be regressing to oral passive- dependencies on a regular basis.

This person is more likely to be a follower than a leader.

T h e smiling, congenial, easy going young person who is always open to influence from others is reflecting an oral-personality style. Since love is equated with the ingesting of food in the oral stage, these personality types tend to be heavy eaters — and often therefore over- weight. Any oral personality might also enjoy other mouth-related activities, such as gum- chewing, drinking, smoking, or simply talk- ing and laughing with others.

I f mother loves baby, baby gives feces when coaxed to do so on the potty; if m o t her re- jects baby, baby withholds feces in retribu- tion. For this reason, Freud took fecal con- tent in d r e ams as s y mbolizing something very valuable like money,'\" or in the case of females, as symbolizing a baby.\"' Mi sers are anal adults, for they want t o r e t ain m o ney (derivative of feces ).

Pha/lie Personality The Oedipal complex takes place during this stage and fixations at the phallic level there- fore take on the d y n amic characteristics of t his most important of al l t r i a n g les in t h e life of every person. If the Oedipal complex has not been satisfactorily resolved, the adult person will develop a neurosis (see p. 67). However, more restricted fixations and the female's rather subdued working through of the Oedipal result in d i s tinctive personality styles that are not in themselves neurotic (see self because these are all women he cannot discussion of m a l e -female d i R erences, pp. 67 — 69). We therefore expect to see a sexualized pattern in the phallic personality. This adult might be concerned with l o o k in g s exually attractive to the opposite sex. He or she may be very sel f center-ed and egotistical. The \"glamour-girl\" s tereotype fits here. U n l i k e the urethral character discussed above, the p hallic character not only fl i r t s bu t c a r r i es through on sexual liaisons with a vengeance. The \"Don Juan\" type of man, who presum- ably goes from one l ov e aRair t o a n o t h er seeking mother substitutes, is fixated at thi s level. For th e p h a l l i c p e r s onality, h etero- sexual love is more colored by lust than af- fection (aim-inhibited lust ) . These people may masturbate when tense or upset. Male phallic personalities are often driven by unconscious remnants of th eir castration a nxiety.

This attitude frames her fixation at the phallic level with what Freud called a m a sculinity c orn p/ex.

Yet this does not invalidate his views for any one individual currently active in this movement. Obviously, only a clinical case history framed from the psychoanalytical perspective would settle the issue for any individual woman. Another controversial area in which Freud- ian theory is being challenged today is that of homosexuality. A s we n o t ed a b o v e (p. 7 1), homosexual behavior w a s not con- sidered a healthy alternative to normal hetero- s exual behavior in t h e F r e u d ia n o u t l o o k . H omosexuals are one type of p h a l li c p e r - sonality. Freud's psychological explanations of the origins of homosexuality varied over the years, and he was always careful to note that genetic or h ereditary factors probably contributed to the likelihood of a person be- coming a homosexual. His theory of female homosexuality is particularly unclear, but we might take a look at the most common homo- sexual theory Freud advanced. Homosexuality begins in the phallic phase for the boy, even though his actual decision for a lasting homosexual adjustment is pre- sumably not made until around the onset of pubescence.\"' In o rder to e x p l ain h o m o - sexuality in the male, Freud made use of the from object-choice to identification (see dis- c ussion on p. 6 6 an d p . 6 9 ). The homo- sexual boy is one who has been very close to and presumably pampered, doted over, greatly p rotected by a maternal figur e (mother or m other-substitute). Rather than t a k ing t h i s mother as object in the phallic stage, thereby initiating the Oedipal complex, the male in- vert reverts from object choice and identi fies w ith his mother. He t h e reby not o nl y b e - comes feminized in his outlook, but he also seeks to re-enact the mother-son love pattern that he had enjoyed, playing the mother's p art himself and u s in g o t he r b o y s a s h i i ' substitute.\"' As he moves into latency, there- fore, his sexual instincts may be l ess aim- inhibited than those of normal boys. Other males are really projections of himself, and he seeks to cathect them with libido as stand- ins for h i m s e l f — also a variation o n t h e i dentification process. H o m osexuality a n d narcissism are therefore related phenomena, because what the homosexual is seeking is a narcissistic self-love through loving h i m self in other males.\"' This was an important theoretical point: although homosexual acts in earlier rnatura- t ion are often a n o r m a l f e a t ur e o f s e x u a l education, Freud questioned homosexuality as a satisfactory adjustment beyond the teen- age years because it was a more p r i m i t ive, i dentification-based, narcissistic pattern o f adult behavior than heterosexuality. Modern h omosexuals may dispute this view, and in time the gay community may even alter the dynamics of homosexuality.

Recall that Freud referred to the initial stage of repression as primal (see p. 60). Then later on, the individual is forced to keep re- pressed material down through a continuing repression proper (sometimes called a fter repression by his students ). Neurotics find it impossible to keep Oedipal and other content- memories out of c onsciousness without also making it known overtly in a symptom. We will now review this process, using the sche- matization in Figure 7 as a point of reference for the three-stage compromise model of men- tal illness.

Thus, as with differences in personality, we fall back on the fixation-regression model t o understand differences in ab normal b e - havioral styles.\"' Someone who as an adult is behaviorally abnormal enough to be called psychotic (insane, crazy ) woul d t h e r efore have fixated a large amount of libido at one of the pregenital levels or a moderate amount very early in the oral stage (weakening the developing personality in the process; see p. 73) . Neurotic fixations a re not s o l i b i d i - nously profound nor do they occur so early in life as the psychotic fixations. Neurotic symp- toms of obsessive compulsivity, i-n which the patient is afraid to touch anything for fear of g erms or must follow a rigid ro u t ine in l i f e w ithout variation, would be t r a ced to a n al fixations.

B u t the diRerence between normal an d a b n o r ma l r e g r ession centers around what the person is trying to accom- plish in the process. Freud believed that the neurotic does not reject reality or try to change reality as he or she understands it to be; the neurotic merely flees into illness through a regressive symp- tom-formation. The psychotic, on the other hand, rejects perceived reality in the regres- sive process and then seeks to reconstruct it in fantasy according to how he or she would prefer (wish) that i t b e . T h u s , p s ychotics concoct delusions (unrealistically false be- liefs ) and h a l l u c inations (seeing, hearing things that are not there ), whereas neurotics retain a better contact with perceived reality. Freud then suggested that the no rma/ per- sonality combines the best, most constructive features of b ot h c l i n i cal s y n dromes. \"We call behaviour 'normal' or ' healthy,' if i t combines certain features of both reactions- if it disavows the reality as little as does a neurosis, but if it t he n exerts itself, as does a psychosis, to eRect an alteration of t h a t reality.\" '\" In short, the normal person fights to keep in contact and to eRect a construc- tive outcome, a change in the external state of things. Normals neither run away from a time. Anxiety Theory Freud experienced some maj or di ff iculties getting his theory of a n x i ety stated clearly over his long career. Problems arose when anxiety seemed for a time to be taking over the energizing role that Freud had assigned to libido (and, by implication, to the energy of the Death Instinct as well ). It seems clear t hat Freud vi ewed anxiety as h e d i d a n y emotion ( see p. 46), that i s , as a feeling- tone that takes place in the physica/ realm. A nxiety is something felt in th e b o dy. It i s not s omething that r u ns t he m i n d , p a r t i c - ularly the unconscious mind! But for a long time, thanks to a way he had of referring to anxiety, it seemed as though F r eu d r e ally m eant for anxiety — a feeling rooted in t h e body — to be the main motivator of the per- sonality.

Fr eud said very clearly that, whereas hysterics convert a psy- chical excitation (fellatio fantasy ) into a physical symptom (cough or sore th roat ), anxiety neurotics convert one p h ysical ex- citation (sexual tension ) into another physi- cal manifestation (anxiety attack ) .'\" Of c ourse, we are r e f erring no w t o t h e c a s e of anxiety in an acrzzaL neurosis. In the case of anxiety hysteria (psychoneurosis proper ), the individual transforms a psychical excitation (libido) into physical manifestations (symp- toms ) along the l i n e s o f t h e compromise model in Figure 7. It was this latter use of anxiety that Freud turned to.

It is vital to ap - preciate that in th e F r eudian view, the ab- normal person (as well as the normal person ) does not behave symptomatically in order to a void anxiety. I n d eed, as w e h a v e s e e n , anxiety is often itself a symptom of \" s ome- thing else\" in the personality. Abnormal be- havior is defensive and regressive because it is seeking to avoid confronting the repressed m ental content, w h ic h i n t u r n i s m o v e d a bout in t h e p s y c h e ( mind) by l i b i d o (mental energy ) as well as by the energy of the Death Instinct. Anxiety is a physical emo- tion, \"felt\" mentally as all sensations includ- ing sight and hearing are experienced men- t ally. But a n x i ety n o m o r e r u n s t h e p e r - sonality than vision or hearing. In order to c l ear u p s uc h p r o b lems, in 1925, some thirty-odd years after proposing his first (entirely physical ) theory of anxiety to Fliess in their exchange, Freud settled on a more g e neral d e f i n i tion o f a n x i e t y a s simply \"a reaction to a situation of danger.\" \"' Anxiety symptoms occurring at stage III of Figure 7 are t h erefore seen as substitutes, as the means whereby the i n d i v i dual can avoid facing up to the return of the repressed. Rather than being a major motivator, anxiety is merely an instrumentality or a s i gnal of the real danger that is yet to come. As Freud said: \".. . t h e eg o subjects itself to anxiety as a sort of inoculation, submitting to a slight attack of the i l l n ess in o r der t o e scape its full strength. It vividly imagines the danger- situation, as it were, with the u n m i stakable purpose of r estricting t ha t d i s t r essing ex- p erience to a mere in dication, a signal.' ' \" In speaking of th e ego subjecting itself to anxiety, Freud meant t ha t t h e u n c o nscious p ortion of the ego, which k n ows w hat t h e \"danger-situation\" is, submits itself including its conscious portion to anxiety, thereby off- setting a complete confrontation or \"facing- up-to\" of the Oedipal themes that are bring- ing on the danger. Freud now specifically removed anxiety f rom being only transformed libido.'\" L i t e r - ally any situation of danger — real or imagined — could generate anxiety. Since the id is un- able to evaluate situations, it does not even \"feel\" this emotion. In fact, neither does the superego \"feel\" anxiety, which is why it can wish for s u c h h a r s h s e l f - punishments as people inflict on themselves — as when some- one cuts off a finger or a hand to \" pay for\" the past sins committed by t hi s appendage (the realization of a superego wish in overt behavior! ). Only the ego is said to produce a nd feel anxiety that i s b a sed o n i d a n d s uperego promptings, but is d on e i n o r d e r to self-deceive and avoid doing what the id a nd superego want done directly.\"' I n f a c t , Freud's final types of anxiety paralleled what he had earlier called the \"three tyrannical masters\" of th e e go, n a mely \" t h e e x t ernal world, the super-ego, and the id.\" \"' Each of these sources of influence has its own inten- tions (wishes ) that i t w o u l d l i k e t h e e g o as personality executive (arbitrator, decision maker, identity in the mi ddle ) to do, to be, to act out overtly.

She knows what t h i s i s u n - consciously (the unconscious portion of her ego knows! ). She does not want to be \"hit\" with this unacceptable wish for her mother' s death bearing down on consciousness (stage II of Figure 7 ). Hence, the anxiety and the fainting are her means of \"j umping off the track\" without r eally k n o w in g c o n sciously why she is doing so. But t h ese are merely the synzproms of her problem and as such do not cause her behavior to take place. What causes her behavior is a totally unacceptable picture of herself as harboring an unconscious wish she cannot accept into c o n sciousness; there is possibly an additional concern lest she actually do something to bring about her m other's death. Behavior is c a used by a l l these meanings, by the psychological circum- stance of her existence, and zzoz. 'by the bio- logical complex of her feelings. F reud termed the f i nal t yp e o f a n x i e t y m oral, tying it t o th e s uperego of th e p e r - sonality. Recall that in F r eudian t erms, the superego is formed out of fear (see p. 68). m ade and the dentist prepares to drill o u r infected tooth, we become fearful. Freud's first form of anxiety probably always touches on the emotion of f ear at s ome point. H e called this realistic anxiety, because it points to a factual challenge in the external world (the first of the three harsh masters ). Real- istic anxiety is experienced by a young man w ho knows t ha t h e i s t o g o i n t o b a t t l e tomorrow; he is safe for the night, but what of tomorrow t It i s t h i s k i n d o f f e a r t h a t many of t h e t r a u m a ti c n e u r o t i cs (shell- shocked ) have, for any of a number of rea- s ons, failed to master. Freud said that t h e very first (prototypical ) form of this anxiety occurs at birth, which is the first tr aumatic situation we all face.\"\" Simply growing up and taking leave of one's parents can also be seen as involving r e alistic anxieties in living.\"' The second form of anxiety relates to the compromise model (Figure 7 ) and w a s termed neurotic anxiety. If a person has an inadequately resolved Oedipal complex, then the id-wishes that have not b een p r operly repressed by the ego (and superego ) con- tinually threaten to r e t urn t o c o n sciousness following puberty (stage II of Figure 7 ).'\" The thought, \"I wish mother w ere dead,\" might come dangerously close to conscious awareness in the teen-aged girl, who might at this point use the defense of anxiety by developing fainting spells (stage III of Figure 7). She is now completely preoccupied with anxiety over her fainting (conversion ) and no longer in danger of confronting the true mental state. Note that it would be incorrect to say that this girl's behavior is \"motivated by anxiety.\" The girl is no more determined by anxiety than we would be determined by anxiety (or fear ) as we stood on a railroad track with a fr eight tr ain bearing down on us, r oaring and w h i s t l in g o u r i m m i n e n t destruction.

The id and superego are often extreme in their demands because they do not have to suRer these biologically based feelings. There is another truism of Freudian psychology to be noted here. Quite often Freud found the c ause of a n e u r otic symptom i n t h e t o o - harsh, too-demanding superego, which serves as the handmaiden of cultural taboos and prohibitions. This takes us to the final topic of this section.

Freud's attitude toward the Golden Rule is interesting in this regard: \" 'Love thy neigh- bour as t h yself' i s t h e s t r o n g est d e f ence against human aggressiveness and an excellent example of the unpsychological proceedings of the cult ural s uper-ego. Th e c o m m and- ment is impossible to fulfill ; s uch an en or- m ous inflation of l o v e ca n o n l y l o w e r i t s value, not get rid of the difficulty.\" \"' The reason the superego can become so cruel and literally wish to destroy the ego is, that as the individual checks his or her out- wardly directed hostility, the ego i d eal be- c omes ever more severe.

Although we refer to free association, the f act that Freud believed he could i n t i m e come to guess or discern his client's repressed mental contents reflected his belief in p s y chic determinism (see discussion of deter- m inism in C h a p ter 4 , p . 2 6 2 ) .

The resultant confusion of details acts as a smokescreen. A woman with an oral personality might regress to a s tate of c h i l d l i k e d e p e n dency an d \" y e s doctor\" the therapist, letting insightful com- ments go over her head by agreeing to every- thing the analyst says without really letting the insights register and thereby have an im- pact on her personality. Another way in which the client can resist is to change the nature of the r elationship, from analyst analysand (the l-atter is the per- son being analyzed ) to one of father-son or father-daughter or two brothers or two lovers. Freud found that several of his female clients began relating to hi m i n a m o s t u n p r o fes- s ional and o f te n a m o r ou s m a n n er. T h e y asked him questions about his personal life, they wanted to know what kinds of books he read, or what he did w it h h i s f ree t i me.

Final Theory o f Cure Thus far we have been considering the gen- e ral terminology t ha t e v o l ved i n F r e u d ' s thinking about the nature of cure. His final formulation brought in libido as well (which w e mentioned only i n p a s s ing a b o ve ) as fundamental to transference. The final theory of cure may be summarized in six points. 1. The neurotic is a person with significant primal repressions (Figure 6), including those surrounding the unresolved Oedipal complex. Due to the repetition compulsion, the neurotic seeks in i n t erpersonal rela- tions to r e-enact these Oedipal t h emes, t rying to find t ha t sense of love that h e or she never adequately repressed, substi- t uted, or sublimated. Freud t e rmed t h i s seeking of love in relations with others a libidinal anticipatory idea (that is, looking forward in anticipation of recapturing the Oedipal cathexes by projecting the imago onto others ).\"' This li bidinal idea, which encompasses the fuero-demand (see p. 62), is in operation unconsciously and it might be something like \"Won't you give me your love and sexual commitment>\" or \"Maybe now I can smooth things over and experience that love that was denied me earlier.\" These libidinal a n t i cipatory ideas influence the neurotic's behavior in h is or h e r e v e r y day r o u t i ne , b r i n g i n g a bout t h os e t r a n s f erences o n t o o t h e r s w hom the person must deal w i t h d a i l y (see p. 95). It i s t h i s r e -enactment With others that eventually drives the neurotic ambivalence emerge in the early sessions- the usual course of tr ansference is from a positive to a negative stage. Freud believed that successful therapy calls for a c omplete resolution of th e t r a nsference phenomenon. The full implications of the transference onto the therapist must be made clear to the pa- tient, who through insight gains an un der- standing of his or her d y n amics. As Freud put it, \"At the end of an analytic treatment the transference must itself be cleared away; and if success is then obtained or continues, it rests, not on suggestion, but on the achieve- m ent by its means of an overcoming of in - ternal resistances, on the internal change that h as been brought about in th e p a t i ent.\" \" ' Many ex-patients who leave their therapists during the stage of negative transference are highly critical of the procedure and give psy- c hoanalysis an u n deservedly bad n a m e .\" ' Even so, Freud did not favor avoiding such — what he took to be — necessities of the thera- peutic procedure; he did not th ink i t a d v i s- able to use the transference-love to manipu- late clients and thereby allow the hostile re- pressions to escape examination. The therapist must also be careful about forming a countertrans ference, w hich i n - volves the unconscious motives that the ther- apist might have acted out in relations with the client.\"' I f t h e t h e r apist has not devel- o ped adequate insight into his or he r o w n personality dynamics, then very possibly there will be a reversal of the usual procedure, in which the therapist uses the client as a \"blank screen\" on which to project imagoes. This is why Freud b e lieved that a p s y c h oanalyst should first b e a n a lyzed before personally undertaking the role of therapist.'\" I n d eed, as we shall see below, he even favored a kind of continuing, p eriodic p sychoanalysis for therapists (as patients! ) to keep them grow- ing and in command of their mental and emotional faculties.

Freud measured his success as a psychoanalyst according to the extent that he could re- m ove arnnesias dating from r o u g hly t h e second to the fifth year of the client's life when the Oedipal complex was active.'\" Because it brings out the dynamics of such Oedipal fixations, Freud c a lled t r ansfer- ence the \"true vehicle o f therapeutic in flu ence.\" \"' We must also keep in mind that transference has its resistance components to hinder therapy, and that such duality is common to neurotics who are generally a mbivalent i n b e h a v i or .' \" R e c a l l t h a t every neurotic symptom means at least two things (repressed wish p l u s r e p r essing wish! ) . 4. As the neurotic client moves through psy- choanalysis, he or she develops an arti ficial or trans formed neurosis w ithin t he f o u r walls of the consulting room.'\" T h i s i s a miniature replica of the neurotic dynamics then being acted out in everyday like. It is prompted by the repetition-compulsion na- ture of the instincts, so that th e n eurotic cannot help but reHect the Oedipal dynam- ics in the therapeutic relationship. Freud occasionally referred to this miniature re- enactment as the trans ference illness,\"' a usage that has led to some confusion, be- cause the artificial or transformed neurosis has since been called the trans ference neu rosis by some of his f o l l o w e rs. Actually, the latter phrase is better reserved for a distinction that Freud made between those m entally disturbed individuals wh o c a n profit from therapy and those who cannot. 5 . Put in m e n t a l-energy terms, w h e n we speak of positive or negative feelings be- i ng transferred to th e t h e r a pist vi a i m - agoes, we are also saying that libidinal or h ostile cathexes are taking p l a c e (Eros and/or the Death Instinct is active ). This i s another way of speaking about the l i - into therapy, because all sorts of interper- sonal problems arise as the acting-out pro- cess distorts normal social relations.\"' 2. In therapy this same acting-out process oc- curs in the tr ansference of feelings onto the therapist. There are three aspects to transference, two of which are positive and one negative. First, a n e u r o ti c t r a n sfers affectionate, friendly feelings for the thera- pist as a person ahelp— er with the power and authority to cure a sickness or solve a problem. Second, there are the positive transferences of an erotic, sexually lustful n ature that ar e a c t u ally a i me d a t t h e imago. Third, there are the negative trans- ferences of a hostile, death-wishing variety that are also aimed at th e i m ago r ather than the person of th e t h e r apist. Freud candidly admitted that it is on the basis of the first factor in transference that the re- lationship between patient and doctor i s built and out of which the therapist gains a certain power of suggestion to inHuence the neurotic to change. But it is the neur- otic who must do the hard work of facing up to the repressed contents if therapy is t o work. As Freud put it : 8 e readily admit that the results o f psy- choanalysis rest upon suggestion; by vug- g esti on, ho+ ever, u e must understand. . . the in fluencing of a person by means o f the trans ference phenomena u hich are possible in his ca te.

Shifting our emphasis to the energic type of Freudian explana- tion, we might say that psychoanalysis as a therapeutic method r e q u i res t ha t t h e client be able in fact to cathect objects.

We need the dynamic play staged by the acting-out in order to inter- pret for the client what is going on in his or hex life. Based on this capacity for cathexis to occur or not, Freud distinguished between those people who can profit from psycho- analysis and those who cannot. People, he said, suRer from two basic kinds of neu- roses: (I) the trans ference neuroses, which include anxiety neurosis, hysteria, and ob- sessive-compulsive disorders; and (2) the narcissistic neuroses, w hich i n c l u de t h e schizophrenias and the more serious affec- tive disorders like manic-depression. Today we consider the latter disorders to be psy- choses (insanity ) . The point F r eud w a s making, however, is that any mental dis- o rder takin g o n a na r c i s s i stic f e a t u r e means that the individual has removed all libidinal cathexes from the external world and affixed them onto his or her own per- sonality structure (taking self as object ). The woman who has regressed to the severe psychotic state of hebephrenia (a form of schizophrenia ) — doing nothing all day but making faces and giggling a lot, sucking her t h u mb , an d s o i l in g h e r self without concern — is no longer in libidinal contact with the outer world. She has built her dream world in he r n a r cissistic neu- rosis (psychosis ) and now lives complet ely within it as a baby, and no psychoanalyst can hope to break into her delusions as a s ignificant part of he r d a i l y l i f e .\" ' T h e m an who goes through life with all ki n d s o f physical symptoms, expecting t o b e w orried over an d c a re d f o r b y o t h e x s , does experience libidinal anticipatory ideas, meaning he does c athect others in h i s transference neurosis, and t h e r efoxe he tvoutd he a proper candidate for psycho- analysis. We could a s t h e r apists expect him to re-enact his dynamics in the trans- f ormed neurosis of t h e t h e r a p y h o u r . Using this fascinating replay of the Oech- pal situation, said Freud, \"we oblige him t o transform his r epetition i nt o a m e m - ory\" which is insight.\"' 6. In more precise libido terms, the patient i n psychoanalysis comes gradually to r e - move libido from object cathexes in the environment and from the symptoms man- i fested in the body an d t o r e d i r ect t h i s f ree libido onto the relationship with t h e therapist. This is wh y t h e t h e r a p ist be- comes so important to the client; he or she is now an object in which very rxiuch libido is invested.

It may begin this way, but in time a client should begin extending his or her growing feeling of competence to in- terpersonal relations with others, building a realm of cathected objects including aim- inhibited contacts of a friendly nature. It is also important to prevent a client from forming additional repressions. When this happens the ego has to use libido to form anticathexes, and this simply w a stes en- ergies which could be better used in adapt- ing to the external world. Gradually, the \"ego is enlarged at the cost of this uncon- s cious.\" \"' T h e m a n w h o h a d b e f o r e shrunk from people and regressed to states o f physical self-concern now b e g in s t o m eet others, to e n t ertain an d b e e n t e r - tained by them.

The t herapist waits for th e r i g h t m o m e nt , a n d when these feelings are clearly active, makes an interpretation to the young man. The re- sultant insight works, even though there may still be a d e g r e e o f r e s i s t ance to work through. But now, a related problem in this case might be this young man's inability to compete with other men. The therapist might i nclude this f e a r o f c o m p e t i t i o n i n t h e broader interpretation of th e y o u n g m a n ' s personality conflicts. But since the young man has not brought this conflict into the tr ans- formed neurosis — for example, by awkwardly t rying to compete with the t h erapist in th e use of language, only to abruptly switch and ridicule all those who use \"big w o r ds\" — no interpretation made by th e t h e r a pist based o n past life c ompetitions wit h o t h e r m e n will work .

They d o end for on e p r o b l em, bu t t h e n b e g i n again (in a sense ) to consider another problem. going back to the pathognomic situation and being recalled at that point and now a cted out (abreacted ), then the emotional release (catharsis ) signifies that a legitimate recollec- t ion is being made.

Just as many styles of behavior are subsumed by the term pe rson ality, so too we can refer to various styles of relating to clients as techniques. Evolution o f the Relationship Freud began his career like most neurologists of his day, using various physical remedies for the treatment of mental illness, including sedatives, rest, massage, hydrotherapy (for example, baths or stimulating showers ), diet control, and change of routine. Freud's cli- ents were predominantly of the upper socio- economic classes,\"' and th erefore he could send them off for a period of rest at a local resort spa. Of course, in extremely disturbed (psychotic) cases, he hospitalized the patient. Freud gradually defined a new doctor-patient relationship as he evolved the psychoanalyti- cal technique.\"' As we recall, Freud began his search for the pathognomic (repressed ) memory through the technique of hy p n otic a ge or t i m e r e - gression. The patient was asked to relax in a reclining or semireclining position on a sofa, and hypnosis was induced through the usual suggestions of drowsiness, falling off to sleep, and so foxth. As he used this technique with more clients, Freud found that not all of them could be pu t u n d e r a . sufficiently deep hypnotic state to bring about time r e- g ression. In fact, several could not be h y p - notized at all. Freud recalled that Bernheim (one of the French doctors he had studied with ) could get subjects to remember what had gone on d u r i n g a p r e v i o u s h y p n otic trance by taking their heads in his hands and e ssentially ordering t h e m (strong sugges- tion ) to do so. When one day a difficult pa- tient was not responding to the hypnosis in- structions, Freud took her head in his hands, Therapeutic Techniques The relationship between therapist and client is commonly referred to as a method of ther- apy. Though we have occasionally employed this usage earlier in the chapter, at this point we will keep more stxictly within our defini- tion of method (see Introduction ) as the ve- hicle for the exercise of evidence, and refrain from using me thod in t h e p r e s ent section, which deals with therapeutic techniques. The evidential usage would b e a p p ropriate for Freud, because he believed that psychoanal- ysis is a scientific investigation in ad dition to a curative process.

The therapist did not have to retrace these steps later after the client came out of hypnosis, when the added p roblem now arose of trying to remember what went o n in the hypnotic trance.

It was only a matter of t i m e u n t i l F r e u d n o te d a strange and annoying tendency in the client's eRorts to recall the past while not under hyp- nosis. He found them recalling all m a nner of trivia, apparently unrelated scraps of in- formation that had no hearing on their neu- rotic symptoms.

Freud began to question his clients a bout these screen memories, taking t h e m even further back in time, until he hit upon the technique of free association. For a time, Freud used both the pressure technique and free association in combination, but by 1905 he had stopped touching the client entirely (a dangerous procedure, considering the mat- ter of transferences ). Thus today free asso- ciation has emerged as the ex clusive tech- nique of the classic psychoanalyst (see p. 94 for a discussion of this technique ). oRers them.'\" Vieu of Therapeutic Change Freud was aware of the historic relationship psychoanalysis had with hypnosis, and hy way of this tie, the possible criticism that he had cured people exclusively through suggestion. He defined suggestion as uncritically accept- ing an idea implanted in one's mind hy an- o ther,'\" bu t h e d i d n o t a c c ept t ha t t h i s i s what went on during psychoanalysis. He felt that the id promptings which lay at the root of a neurosis could not be s o e asily in flu- enced, thanks to the counterweight influence of the superego and the compromise eRected by the ego. The id, after all, is illogical and r efuses to evaluate any o f i t s anticipatory ideas realistically. The th erapist can use a little suggestion because the client likes him or her as a person (see p. 98), but this kind o f suggestion is directed to the ego and i t m ight not help a t al l w i t h t h e i d !

According to Freud, suggestion is based o n sexual forces in o p e r ation b e t w een t w o people. Its power in therapy results from the childlike dependency — the re-enactment of an infantile relationship — on the person of the therapist as a stand-in for others.

T h u s , s ays Freud, \"analysis sets the neurotic free from the chains of his sexuality.\" \"' Client Prognosis and Trial Analyses Freud once suggested (half jokingly) that the ideal client for psychoanalysis is a person suHering considerably from an inner conflict that he or she cannot solve alone. This per- son would therefore come to analysis literally b egging for help.'\" A n y t h in g s hoxt of t h i s ideal circumstance — which is pxobably never realized, we might add — detracts from the prognosis (likelihood of cure ) in a given case. If a man is forced into analysis by rela- tives, this is not a good prognostic sign. If a woman is using psychoanalysis as a way of getting back at her husband through making him pay for large doctor bills, this is not a good prognostic sign. As we know from our discussion of the narcissistic neurosis (see p. 99), psychotic individuals are not good bets for psychoanalysis nor are the mentally re- t arded, the br ain d a m aged, or t h e s e n i l e members of our society. Children present a special difficulty, and in truth Freud was not much attracted to the role of child t h erapist. His f amous case of Little Hans (Volume X ) was based on the work of an intermediary therapist — the boy' s father — who saw Freud privately and t h en carried the sexual interpretations to his five- year-old son in a most open and straightfor- ward manner. In general, Freud thought it w as best for the parent and ch il d t o e n t e r into therapy together. Children externalize their problems in their cu rrent paxental re- lations and therefore it is not too helpful to search about in th eir i n t e rnal psychic lives f or solutions.

Of course, in order to get a r o un d t h e c e n sorship, these ideas must be distorted in various ways so that their content is expressed through sym- bols which must be deciphered. Dreams have a mani fest (apparent, evident ) content or story line which often appears foreign and even odd to us because we do not understand the meaning. For example, we may dream t hat we are w a l k ing u p side down o n t h e ceiling and that our hair is f a l l ing out, but it drops upward to the ceiling instead of to the floor. Each of these dream concepts would be taken as a potential content for h i d d en meaning.

Humankind's use of symbols traces back to its most primitive thought forms, and they can be seen in the various myths and religions of antiquity.\"' A dream is put t o g ether by th e u n c on- scious mind from day re s idues, which are the little bits and pieces of experience during the sleep day (day before night of dream ) on which we have probably not fixed our con- scious attention.\"' Th e d r eam i s p r o m pted by a wish fulfillment, of course, but we must keep in mind that this can be a lustful wish of the id, or it can be the self-punishing wish of the superego.

This wish-fulfilling aspect of dreaming is achieved by way of what he called dream d'or (, and its fundamental way of expression is through imagery.

Freud believed that many dream images are more pregnant with meaning than is minimally necessary to m ake them occur in the first place.\"' M a n y more wishes squeeze into the same dream image than are required to express this con- tent in the dream. Hence, it follows that no single interpretation of the manifest content can capture all of the latent content that is actually being expressed.\"' Dreams are actually the guardians of sleep, because if we could not express our uncon- s cious mental concerns in some f o rm , w e would probably toss and turn all night long.

Do not t ak e t h e m a n i f est content of a dream literally, because it never reflects the unconscious meaning intended. 2. Present various portions of the dream con- t ents to the client as a p r o m p t f o r f r e e association, and do not worry about how far this line of investigation takes you from the original dream story. 3 . Never lead or su ggest things about t h e dream to th e c l i e nt ; w a i t u n t i l s e v e r al dreams and /or free associations to dream contents suggest the direction to be taken in making interpretations.\"' F reud made m an y p r a c t ical h i n t s f o r dream interpretation over the years. The fol- lowing are examples. Dreams produce logical connections by simultaneity in ti me, so that things happening together are probably seen by the dreamer as somehow related. When a cause-eRect relationship is s u ggested, then the dream content is changed or d i storted, as by a sudden shift in scene or the distortion of a face from one person into another' s. If we dream that our parent's face changes into our spouse's, then it is likely that we see an i nfluence stemming from th e f o r me r t o t h e latter. We cannot express either /or in a dream, b ut instead link such a l ternatives with a n and so that opposites can be combined into single images or actions. Any time there is a condensation of dream figures, we must al- ways suspect that the dreamer sees a simi- larity, identity, or possession of common at- tributes between the figures (father and bulls are both strong, if also a bit too demanding ). A popular device used by the dreamer is re versal, or the t u r n i ng i n t o i t s o p p o s ite of some latent wish or i m age in t h e m a n i f est content.

Money can be a tool of resistance for the client, who can use t hi s excuse to terminate the contacts — particularly because the practice followed by Freud (and since by his followers ) was to charge for every sched- u led session, including those that a c l i e n t missed ( except under highly u n u s ual c i r - cumstances ) . The o n l y recourse, Freud thought, is simply to state things clearly to the client at the outset and then to carry on without any further embarrassment. As Freud summed it up, in any case, \" nothing in li f e is so expensive as illness — and stupidity.\" '\" Freud saw his patients for the classic fifty- minute hour. He was not much at tracted to taking notes during the hour, preferring to do this sort of record keeping between pa- t ient appointments and at th e c l ose of t h e day. In the very earliest — including the first- s essions, Freud would simply tur n th e l e ad i n the conversation over to th e c l i ent a n d say, \"Before I can say anything to you I must know a great deal about you; please tell me w hat you know about yourself.\" '\" M an y o f these early sessions undoubtedly were spent in going over details of the illness that had prompted the client to seek assistance. Grad- u ally, they would t u r n t h e i r a t t e n t i o n to dreams and other materials emerging in the free associations. Freud would begin instruct- ing the client in the basics of psychoanalysis, even as early as the fifth or sixth session,'\" but he was decidedly opposed to the patient's in- dependent reading and studying of p sycho- analysis from books.\"' F reud advised his patients not t o m a k e i mportant decisions during t h e c o u r s e o f treatment — such as choosing a profession or selecting a marital partner.\"' Hi s r eason was to limit the patient's chances of making im- portant errors in lif e decisions through the Some Procedura/ Details Although such techniques have been altered considerably today by psychoanalysts, Freud had a patient lie on a sofa while he sat be- hind the head of the patient, out of d i r e ct sight.\"' This position reflected the inHuence of his earlier hypnotic and pressure techniques, but Freud believed, too, that it was wise to e liminate feedback to th e c l i en t f r o m h i s facial expressions.

In t h e l e s ser of life's decisions, he definitely favored a hands- off policy for the therapist. When he first began treating clients, Freud went quickly into an i n t erpretation of their personality dynamics, but later in his career he cautioned against rushing the client.

He admitted that at times if a client is told that there will be only so many more sessions, this can act as a prompt to get around the client's resistance. But Freud felt that one has to use this time- setting technique sparingly, and his reference t o it as a \"blackmailing device\" obviously suggests that Freud did not think h i g hly of it in any case.\"' F r eu d s aid a n alysis ends when the analyst and patient mutually de- c ide to stop seeing one another.

Instincts have an aim, p r essure, source, and object which must be satisfied if homeostasis is to be attained, and it is through the vicissitudes of the instincts that the person experiences pleasure. That is, when the instincts rise in p ressure they have to be eased, and in t h i s return to n o r m a lcy a f e e l in g o f p l e a s u re arises. However, the vicissitudes (rising and falling ) of the instincts is not simply auto- matic, for people can intentionally bring on i ncreased pressure of an i n s t inct, as w h en t hey wish fo r s e xual excitement or t h i n k about favorite foods. The psyche has an in- nate capacity to fr ame experiences that in turn inHuence the instinctive drives to change their level and even the way in w h ich t h ey will be enacted overtly. Much of t hi s f r am - ing of experience goes on at an unconscious level. Indeed, conscious thought arises from unconsciousness in the course of development and is never more than a sm all p o r t ion of the total mind (psyche). Certain unconscious thoughts which frame wishes for external objects cannot be enacted overtly because of their hostile and /or sexual nature.

When a wish cannot be enacted, it is counteracted by another wish, leading to what Freud called repression — and thereby, any of a number of defense mechanisms can be brought to bear in order to fulfill the in- tentions of the wish. When he began attribut- ing such intentional, self-directing behavior to human beings, Freud ran into trouble with colleagues like Breuer and Fliess, who pre- ferred to remain with the biological reductive explanations of natural science. Thus, where- as Freud traced the strangulations of affect to be seen in hysteria to defensiveness, Breuer claimed it was due to an i n h erited physical condition which he called the hypnoid state. Freud was not completely insensitive to the criticisms of his t elic, anthropomorphic style of explanation, so he began to analogize to physical energies by introducing a concep- tion of psychic energies which supposedly p ropelled the mind a l ong o n t h e o r de r o f p hysical energy. He a l w a y s admitted that psychoanalysis did not provide the evidence for this energy conception, but that biology seemed to demand it, and he was, after all, a p hysician. The chief energy he used in h i s explanations and the only one he ever named was libido, the energy of the sexual instinct. As his theory developed, Freud always found it possible to explain things in either a strictly psychological manner or in an energic man- n er. Thus, his topographical model of t h e psyche, which enlarged on his initial depth model, effectively broke down the personality into three somewhat distinct identity points- t .~At 1 c th e i r l P A A ~ f l C 1 1 ~ c r o n -~ I k ~ i ~ T ' T T A n L J.

We all enter life as id creatures in a state of primary narcissism, which gradually gives way to a less selfish, more realistic approach to life- one in which we consider the feelings and a ttitudes of others with w hom w e i d e n t i f y . Much of this identification is out of fear, as i n the boy's castration anxiety p r o m p t i n g identification with the father during the Oedi- pal conflict. As a result of such identifications, the per- son begins to put down w ha t F r eu d called the ego, and its closely related aspect, the superego. Freud did not a l w ays distinguish clearly between these two aspects of the per- sonality, so that the fundamental break-down of the psyche is oppositional (id versus ego states ) . When he fi l l e d i n t h i s p i c t u r e o f opposed psychic identities representing dif- ferent aspects of life — the id ou r o r g a n i c- animalistic side, the ego and superego our sociocultural side — Freud employed psychic energies as kinds of \"precious material\" that t he three identities maneuver over to c o m - mand and to use. A wish becomes a cathexis or a fixing of li bido upon a desired object's image in the mind — literally occupying this image with precious energy that then orients the psychic structure to attain t hi s e nd. A repression of this wish becomes a counter- cathexis, or an a p p l ication of o n e p s y chic force against the other. Sublimation involves r aising the sociocultural levels of th e e n d s sought, so that, say, rather than engaging in c opulation the artist expends libido to p r o - duce a painting. Projection involves disown- i ng one's wishes by a t t r i b u t in g t h e m t o others.

Initially, the sexual was opposed to the self-preservative instincts. Later, Life was op- posed to the Death Instinct. It was also possi- ble to fuse instincts from each of these sides into a kind of (dialectical> ) synthesis. Freud never coined a name other than libido for his instinctive energy. Development was there- fore explained in terms of psychosexual stages framed around the progression and /or fixa- tion and regression of libido. Everyone moves through a course of p sychosexual develop- ment in the oral stage and then passes con- s ecutively through th e a n al, u r e t hral, an d phallic stages until latency holds the psychic s tructure in abeyance for a t i me. W it h t h e onset of puberty, the progression of psycho- s exual development continues, and i n t h e ideal case, terminates in full development at the genital stage. D evelopmental progression through t h e stages is never perfect and hence a series of more or less pronounced fixations occur, ex- plained by Freud as pockets of libidinal re- tention that can, later in l i f e , b e r e couped thanks to the operation of regression. Indi- v idual differences in p e r s onality ar e a c - counted for by the nature and extent of fixa- tion, so that personality styles are analogized to the predominant concerns of the psycho- sexual stages. Thus, the adult oral personality is most likely to be passively receptive, the anal personality orderly, the urethral person- ality ambitious, and the phallic personality narcissistic. Male-female differences are ex- plained in light of the dynamics of the Oedi- pal situation, which supposedly leaves females with a less well-formulated superego than Freud's theory of il l ness moved through several formulations but settled finally on a t hree-stage compromise f o r m u l ation t h a t combined his diphasic model of sexual mat- uration with h i s fi x a t i o n -regression thesis. Though he always accepted the possibility of biologically based (actual ) n e u roses, he viewed the majority of illnesses seen by psy- chiatrists as caused by the return of memories o nce repressed to avoid acting them out or e ven facing up to t h e f ac t t h a t t h e y w e r e e ntertained.

Al l n e u r o sis b e g ins, F r e u d thought, in an unresolved or poorly resolved Oedipal conflict. Psychosis is merely a more extensive type of mental deterioration, one in which the fixations have begun earlier in life and have involved more extensive pocket- ing of libido than is true in neurosis. Patho- logical symptoms are always the result of two wishes — both the repressed and the repressing — so that we can speak of them as transform- ing the libidinal cathexes into a symbolical manifestation of the meaning mental illness has for the person. T hough he ha d a r r i v e d a t h i s t h e o r y through analogies to physical energy, Freud o bviously retained his t e li c e m p h asis. H e spoke of symptoms as conversions of libido, b ut these signs of i l l n ess have an \" o r g a n speech,\" in that they can express the reasons for the illness. Psychosoma tic symptoms tell u s what is bothering the person. An u l c e r patient wants to be fed and cared for even though there may be a facade of indepen- dence in his or her behavior. A. constipated person is holding back not simply fecal mat- ter but the love that he or she feels has been withheld in t ur n b y o t h e rs. N e u rotics con- tinue trying to adjust to their external world of real interpersonal relations. Psychotics, on the other hand, regress and never return to reality, because their delusions and hallucina- tions serve as substitutes for real living.

In his theory of cure, Freud suggested that only those patients who can form an artificial neurosis in the therapeutic relationship can be treated by psychoanalysis. Psychotics who have what Freud termed a very severe form of narcissistic neurosis cannot be treated be- cause, in order for psychoanalysis to work, the client must be capable of removing libido f rom all other aspects of life and fi x in g i t onto the person of the psychoanalyst. This is the core of the artiFicial neurosis, and if the person is too narcissistic, this becomes im- possible. Once the libido i s r e m oved fr om outside the therapy room and fixed upon the therapist, it becomes possible for the client to redirect it in w a rdly, to restructure his or her ego by way of the transference reactions to the therapist. This all t akes place as in- sights are provided and resistances worked through. The a n alyst uses various means, such as free association, dream interpretation, and the analysis of both positive and nega- tive transference, to provide the client with insight.

H e h a d developed into a p h y s ically l a rge, solitary person, active, yet secretive and self-reliant. Going to school was never a particular joy for him; he d i sliked athletics, mathematics, and the competition for grades among class- mates. Jung tells u s t h a t h e d e l i b e r ately settled for a second-in-the-class standing which he found \" c o nsiderably mor e e n j oyable\" ' than competing for first. Even so, his father' s t utoring had put h i m a h ead o f t h e u r b a n classmates he confronted in Basel, and this superiority led to a r a t he r di fficult h a zing. H e was k i d de d a s a c o u n t r y b u m p k i n , teacher's pet, and so on. He came to despise school, using sickness as an excuse to avoid a ttending, and fo r a t i m e h e a c t u a lly e x - perienced a period of neurotic fainting spells of which he.eventually cured himself through self-discipline.' When he grew to young manhood Jung attended the University of Basel. He was in- terested in historical, classical, anthropologi- cal, and philosophical subjects, but decided on medicine because it was a distinguished pro- fession offering various alternatives for a c areer. Thanks to a s e l ection h e r ea d b y Krafft-Ehing, the f a m ous G e rman n e u r ol- ogist, jung settled on psychiatry as a specialty that could combine his more humanistic and his scientific interests.' Following graduation from medical school, jung t ook a p o s i tion at the Burgholzli Hospital in Zurich, Switzer- land, serving under Eugen Bleuler, the noted psychiatrist who had coined the term schizo- phrenia Bleuler was a pr.ofessor of psychiatry at the University of Zi i r i ch, and Jung was a lso to hold a l e c t u reship there w h il e h e conducted studies on the n a t ure of s c h i zo- phrenia. It was at th e B u r g h olzli H o s pital (from 1900 — 1909 ) that Jung reached maturity as a scientist and became a world authority on the psychology of the abnormal and the normal individual.

Their first meeting took place in V i enna in 1907, and it was memorable because Freud and Jung t a l ked f o r t h i r t e e n c o n secutive hours. In using the method of w ord associa- tion, Jung would ask a patient to respond to a stimulus word with the first word coming to mind. For example, Jung would say garden, and the patient would be f r e e t o sa y an y- thing. Jung then noted certain disturbances in the patient's word associations, such as taking a long time to speak, blocking on a w ord and n o t t h i n k i n g o f a n y t h i n g , o r thinking only of a repetition of the stimulus w ord.' By g o i n g o v e r a s e r i e s o f w o r d s several times, Jung gradually e s tablished that certain of t hese words hun g t o g ether, interlaced in th e p a t i ent's associations, and formed a comp/ex of ideas with a common core of meaning. Since these id ea ma sses were always tied to e m o t i onal c o ncerns of the person, Jung called them fe e ling toned - comp/exes.' The repressed memories and con- flicts of the Freudian school were thus experi- mentally verified b y t h e w o r d - a s sociation method. Jung did not come to Freud as a psychiatric n ovice.

In 1909 they made their famous trip to C l ark U n i v ersity in Massachusetts and it wa s t hi s e x tended contact that led to t h eir b r eak. There were three major reasons for this split. First, Jung was unable to accept the concept of libido as limited to sexual energy.

The relationship between the two cooled noticeably after the t ri p t o A m e r i ca, even t hough Jung was by then president of t h e International Psycho-Analytical Association (thanks to Freud's direct influence ). Follow- ing a stormy convention of the association in Munich in 1913 when Jung's \"heretical views\" on the (collective ) unconscious were t h e focus of debate, Freud and Jung went their separate ways. Though Jung was re-elected to a two-year term as president, future con- ventions during his tenure were made irn- p ossible by the d eveloping W o rl d W a r I , and the two men n ever faced one another again. There followed a very difficult period for Jung, during which he analyzed himself much as Freud had done (see Chapter 1 ) . His only satisfactions at this time came from his wife's emotional support and their grow- ing family. He d escribes this period, from roughly 1913 to 1917, as one of inner uncer- tainty and di sorientation.\" It was as if he w er e being assaulted by fantasies from his unconscious, and he tried t o hold them i n c h ec k t h r o ug h y og a a n d o ther means.

Unlike Freud, who theorized that mind qua mind is free of e m o t i onal content (see p.

Th e mind-body distinction is too often used as an excuse for the theorist who w a nt s t o d e t ract from the importance of the psyche by saying \"Oh, that's only a mental phenomenon, it' s not real.\" J ung was always quick t o p o i n t out that the psyche has as much validity and reality as the (physical) body events on which it is based.\" The person begins life with both a physically ordered structure (hands work much the same for all p e ople ) and a psy- chically ordered structure (people think and c reate meanings in m uc h t h e s a m e w a y ). The psyche has also developed in a purposeful, or teleologica/ line.\" This is one reason why Jung found it w r on g t o s p eak o f b e h avior in only b i o l o gical-instinctive terms.

Individual consciousness is only the flower and the fruit of a season, sprung from the perennial rhizome [root system ] beneath Psyche as a Region In Freud's theory the structures of mind are fixed in relation to the levels of mind, so that, for example, the id is constantly in an uncon- scious segment of the psyche. The id never leaves the realm of u n consciousness to take a self-directed turn around consciousness.

Even so, the reason we have the collective unconscious as the outer shell of our egg-shaped figure is so that, as in Figure 10 below (p. 190), we can drop it down deeper in unconsciousness to show that here, in closest union with the p rimordial past, we h av e c o n tents of t h e collective unconscious residing. combine (agglutinate ) into our very identity a s a person, resulting i n a n i d e n t i fi a b l e t otality withi n t h e p s y ch e k n o w n a s t h e corn plex.

Drawing on the thought of both Bleuler and Pierre Janet, he e quated such occult reactions with th e d i s- sociative reactions of hy sterics and schizo- phr enics.\" Jung noted that mechums often begin by calling out to a presence they sense during an e motionally charged trance state. It i s n o t unusual for the medium to ask this presence, \"Who is there~\" and then, of course, to allow a reply by way of the medium's voice, which may change noticeably in tone and inflection. In asking this suggestive question while in an emotional state, Jung argued, an automatism formed just as such a u t omatic a c tions are formed in cases of hysteria. This identity or p resence is not from th e g r av e bu t r a t h e r from within th e m e d i u m's ow n p s y che. It is, in short, a feeling toned complex (- some- times called feeling toned train a f th-ought ).\" The dynamics of all complexes are as follows: e motions stimulate m e ntal t h o u g h t s (the medium felt close to th e d ead p e rson, ex- perienced emotions toward the dead person ) which then agglutinate around this core of feeling (the dead p erson's at t r i butes are f ormed into a t otal i d entity com bining t h e medium's identity as well ).\" 'The life of a The Adhesive Model of Psychic Structure In order to understand how Jung describes the workings of various \"identities\" within mind (psyche), we have first to understand an adhesive mod'el of mental events that he used. Recall that Jung spoke of feeling toned - complexes in mind. He m e a nt t hat v a rious ideas, attitudes, opinions, and so on, which occur in mind tend to accumulate and com- bine around a core of emotion. In a s ense, these mental contents adhere or stick to this emotional core, they agglutinate like so many red blood cells forming clumps to fight off antibodies. This agglutination of mental con- tents in the psyche is not only a d e f ensive maneuver, of course.

Keep in m in d t h a t J ung did not b e - lieve the psyche had to be l o g i cally consis- t ent. Unlike A d l er (Chapter 2 ), who saw the totality of mind w o r k ing fo r a c o m m on end, Jung's teleology included th e p o s si- b ility of c r oss-purposes within m i n d . T w o separate mental referent points or i d e n t i ties (complexes ) could be seeking to bring about quite diRerent ends in the same personality. We now review four such points of identity before arriving at Jung's specific definition of personality. Ego On e o.f the first major complexes Jung named was the ego comp/ex, which is usually shortened to simply ego. Th e e g o' s m a j or region of activity in th e p e rsonality is con- sciousness,\" but, as we shall see, it is not the only complex in c onsciousness. The ego is that part of our personality that we usually think of as ourselves, containing more of our s trong than our w eak p o i n ts.\" W e t e n d t o think of our weak points as mistakes rather than as genuine parts of our personality. The ego is also without f r on t o r p h o n i n ess, so when we are being fairly genuine and sin- cere we are expressing attitudes of the ego. T he person that we t al k t o w h e n w e a r e a lone, as in driving a c ar, q u i e t l y (\"under our breath\" ) is the ego; that is, the ego does the talking and the answering. The contents agglutinated into the ego complex stem from our personal experience with ou r p h y s i cal body, its strengths and weaknesses, and also from interpersonal relations as we mature.\" An important factor in ego d e velopment is that feeling of success following an achieve- ment. The little girl who wins an award for a poem she wrote achieves a sense of ego development (complex formation ) in the good feeling (emotional core ) of \" I d i d that.\" \" complex depends on the emotional core, for when this feeling extinguishes so too does the c omplex.\" Returning t o t h e e x a m ple o f a religious faith, the person who loses a feeling f or God loses the total meaning t hi s f a i t h h as signified in the past. He o r sh e m i g h t recall the principles of the faith and possibly even go on attending church services. But this complex of mental attitudes and outlooks n o longer exists as a living complex in t h e psyche. Jung believed that most complexes formed in life q u i c kl y s in k b a c k w i t h d e c r easing feeling tone into the memories we all carry about in our personal unconscious. However, if a complex should encounter some related complex, it can adhere to it, and then, thanks t o the added size and i m p o r t ance of t h i s larger agglutination, the older mental contents can begin to r e t ur n t o c o n s c iousness as a \"new\" totality. There is a snowball effect to be seen in complex formation, because the s tronger the complex is, th e m o r e i t w i l l assimilate other contents in the psyche.\" As it grows in s iz e an d s t r ength, it t a ke s on d irective powers in mind, and w e b egin t o n otice its influence in dr eams, slips of t h e tongue, and, as Jung first determined (see p . 177), in o u r association of ideas gener- ally. Whereas Freud believed the dream to be his royal road to th e u n c onscious, Jung concluded, \"The via regia t o t h e u n c o n - scious.. . i s not the dream . . . b u t t h e com- plex, which is the architect of d r eams and of symptoms.\" \" Because Jung so often discussed complexes which have been formed around emotional upsets,\" many people today think incorrectly that every complex is something \"bad.\" Actu- ally, the complex-formation process is simply one of the major ways in wh ich the psyche expresses itself, and a complex can have either a positive or a negative role in th e p erson-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"C hapter 3 The Analytical Psychology of Carl Jung 1 8 7 T he ego can sometimes be the b ut t o f p rojections which ar e s en t o u t w ar d f r o m identities in th e u n conscious and mi r r ored in the ego.\" We can think our personality is becoming accident prone because we begin b reaking things o r i n j u r i n g o u r s e lves i n minor accidents. In Jungian psychology, rather than this thought being some kind of Freudian compromise among ego-superego-id, we would instead be witnessing a projection from the unconscious onto the ego — possibly as an effort to make the ego \"look bad.\" Why should the ego look bad> W e w i l l a n s w er this more fully below when w e d i scuss the balancing of personality, but for now we can just suggest that maybe the ego ha s been looking \"too good.\" So, by way of the prin- ciple of opposites, now the unconscious side of the personality wants to even up the sides a bit. The main point here is that the ego's inHuence is kept primarily in c o n sciousness i n Jungian psychology. It is not f re e to d o unconscious bargaining (compromising ) and is more the moved by than the -mover o f un- c onscious processes.\" The ego i n Jungian psychology therefore plays a lesser role in the personality than it p l ays i n t h e p e r sonality theory of Freudian psychology.

Though the persona is our cover or front in social relations, we always recognize some- thing else as more representative of our true identity ( usually, we thin k o f t h i s as our ego). The reason we equated the p ersona with collective unconsciousness at point 3 in Figure 9 is because social masks are defined for us by our group to apply across the board in everyone's behavior. As Jung himself ob- served, \" . .. what we said of th e c o llective unconscious is also true of the persona's con- tents, that is, they are of a general [objective ] It is virtually impossible to avoid forming some masks in life, at least during our child- hood and youth.

There is a side to our personality that we.are likely to ignore, because it rep- resents all those attitudes, temptations, fears of failing, and even immoral and uncivilized inclinations that we have rejected and kept from doing in the past. The emotional core of such complexes is often of a negative sort, such as envy (\"I want that w r i stwatch he' s wearing badly enough to steal it\" ) or hostility (\" If she frustrates me again I swear I' ll beat her skull in\" ). The ego considers such feel- i ngs and i d eas bu t r e j e cts t he m b y n o t furthering them only to have them form into a complex on the darker side of the person- ality. Jung called this complex of nondevel- o ped feelings and ideas the shadow or t h e alter ego, 72 defining it as follows: \"By shadow I mean the 'negative' side of the personality, the sum of all those unpleasant qualities we like to hide, together with the in sufficiently developed functions and the contents of the personal unconscious.\" \" The shadow is l ik e a n i n f e r io r p e r son- a lity within th e b r o a der p ersonality, a r e - pressed, usually guilt-laden collection of be- haviors located in th e u p p ermost layers of t he personal unconscious.\" We say it i s i n the personal unconscious, because any per- son's actual shadow is f ormed by being the opposite of those behaviors that have entered into consciousness as a part of the ego and the persona complexes. But there is knowl- edge of shadow tendencies in the collective unconscious as well (that is, the shadow is a n archetype; see T a bl e 2 b e l o w ). The shadow is not as flnely diRerentiated as the ego and persona, making it an agglutination of crude, bumbling, even confused behaviors which would shame us and alarm our friends if it m a d e i t s elf k n o w n i n c o n s c iousness.

T h e s h a d ow may have increased its role in Charlie's per- sonality, bringing out all t h ose things he is nor like consciously (principle of opposites ). Even so, Jung believed it was important for us to understand our shadows. If we get in touch with our d a rker side consciously, we do not have to be like it. But i f w e r e p r ess our darker side ( like Charlie did !) , i t c a n in time get hold of our behavior within con- sciousness and change us completely. Having presented the shadow as the nega- tive side of our p e r sonality, in h i s t y p i c al oppositional fashion Jung added t hat o cca- sionally the shadow has a po s itive r o le t o play in the personality. The rarer of the two possible situations occurs when the individual i s living a c o nscious life o f c r i m e a n d /or i mmorality. In t hi s case, the ur ges for b e - having in a socially acceptable way, caring for the feelings of others, and so on, would be repressed and formed into a good type of s hadow.\" Thus, even the sinner has a po - t entially good side, because every time i n the past when he or she opted for evil, there was this other course in life that might have been followed.

Jung viewed the self as the ultimate stage of personality growth, in which the contents of the ego, persona, and shadow are completely acknowledged and dealt with by the self. A person who has developed a self knows that he or she is both loving (ego) yet hateful (shadow ), socially concerned (ego) as well as s elfish (shadow), and energetic (ego) but also lazy (shadow ). Jung used terms like to tality, the ce nter o f per tonality, and wh oleness to capture the basic meaning of selfhood.\" Jung once analogized to the ego in de- fining the self. He said that just as the ego is the subjective point of reference for con- sciousness, so too is th e self th e s u b jective point of reference for the totality of the psy- che.\" As such, the self is an ideal, something that not all people come to realize in their lifetime. This is why i t i s o n l y a p o t e n tial identity point in the personality. We cannot become a completeindividual unless we have first combined the influences of the historical past with the potentials and aspirations of the future.

We have dropped the c ollective-conscious half of th e eg g i n l i e u of the complex of masks we now know to be the persona. The ego is set in the conscious sphere, the shadow sits near the line divid- ing consciousness and unconsciousness, in what we know as the personal unconscious. And the self is sketched in as a dotted circle down more deeply as in potentia, ready to emerge into a definite entity if the conditions are right. When Jung actually used the w ord p e r sonality, h is meaning was similar to w h a t w e know as the self; for example: \"I h a v e suggested calling the total personality which, t hough present, cannot be fully k n o wn, th e self.

The psyche is intentional by nature, and just as primitive humans might anthropomorphize a rock by projecting their subjectively generated images and beliefs onto it, so too does the modern person express unconscious-to-conscious mental contents as symbols. The human being is a symbolizi ng animal, which for Jung meant that people always create meanings that express, say, or intend something (see p. 7 of I n t r o duction for a di scussion of m e aning ). Psychic ex- pressions of meaning take on styles, so that in time we can come to know what is being expressed by recognizing the various patterns or forms of the meanings intended. Symbolism.

Since this symbolic manifestation is likely to have a collective influence behind it, a symbol can even express itself among large masses of people simultaneously.

He defined the instincts as typical modes o f action and then a d d ed t h at t h e a r c h e type might suitably be described as the \"instinct's perception o f itself, or as the self-portrait of the instinct.\"\" A r c h e t ypes are thus typical ways the psyche has of understanding exis- tence; they are s t y l ized p sychic behaviors reflecting the very essence of what the psyche intends to bring about, to learn, accomplish, or express.\" Since they come from the deepest regions of the collective unconscious, the archetypes are also called p rim ordi a1 images \"J u n . g m eant by this that archetypes are just li k e those collective thoughts that a primitive (pri- mordial ) human being had h appen outside of directed thought. There is some problem at this point i n d i s t i n g uishing th e c oncept of archetype from that of syrxibol, and uni- v ersal from fixed-and-unchanging.

He was very critical of F r e u d's tendency to ascribe a sexual significance to all elongated objects (male symbol ) or en- closed places (female symbol ) .\" Jung be- lieved that \"you get caught in your own net if you b e l i eve i n fi x e d , u n a l t e rable sym- b ols.\" \" A s i g n c a n h a v e fi x e d m e a n i n g , but never a symbol.

Continuing our parallel, in th e evolution of hands, the precise nature of fingers, how they work, and so on, depended on the use made of these appendages by the an im als t hat possessed them. It w o u l d n o t b e t o o w rong to say t ha t h a nd s m i r r o r t h e p a s t achievements of the animals possessing them, basing their f o r m o n t h e c h a l l e n ges and threats to survival that were overcome. The same goes for mind. The evolving psyche has had to confront, again an d a g a in , c ertain u niversal themes or m o t if s i n h u m a n e x - perience. These are the most basic themes of life, such as the fact that sexual identities d iffer i n m a l e - f emale r e l ations, th e a w e sensed in confronting a superhuman essence (God), or the realization of a darker side to our personality. As the hand bri ngs with i t a manipulating capacity from birth, the mind brings a capacity to express the past mean- ingful concerns and preoccupations of those animals who were fortunate enough to have evolved such higher mentalities. The mind, or psyche as Jung called it, l a ck s specific contents for these archetypal thematic mean- i ngs. The culture w i t hi n w h i c h a p s y c h e meets experience will provide the items (and the words naming th em ) on th e b a sis of which a symbolical analogy can be drawn- such things as water lilies, the stin, or people dancing in a circle — but it is the n a t ure of the psyche to make such symbolizing possi- ble.\"' And t h i s symbolizing capacity has a stress on the distinction between symbol and sign. Jung is saying that in h a v ing evolved a nd differentiated over t h e c e n t u r i es, t h e psyche has become a process in which sym- bolizing takes place. This is the most funda- rnental nature of m i n d , a s a t e l e o l o gical, symbohzing process. Ideas are framed within those signs that our culture teaches us as we grow up. Hence, the archetypes are at the r oot of t h a t m e a n in g t h a t i s s y m b o l i z ed through cultural names for certain im ages.

This h and paints a b e a utiful p i c t u re, an d t h e delicacy of its movements gives us some idea of what its owner's life has been like, while that hand is preoccupied with stealing from others, thereby revealing an alternative possi- bility for the hand w h ich m i gh t h ave been that of an artist' s.

Possibly the most appropriate phrase Jung used to capture the meaning of archetypes was \"a priori categories o f possible f u n c tioning.\" \" ' T h e y a r e a p riori because they come to us through in - heritance before birth, and are already there for possible but no t n e c essary functioning O ver the years, thanks to hi s s t ud y o f dreams, mythologies, legends, religions, and even alchemy, J ung came to c l assify t w o broad categories of archetypes. First, there were the personi fying archetypes,'\" which naturally took on a humanlike identity when they functioned in the psyche. For example, there is the anima in m a n a n d i t s c o u n t er- part in woman, the animus. The anima rep- resents all o f m a n ' s a n c estral experiences with woman, and the animus represents all of woman's ancestral experiences with man.'\" J ung believed that the most d i rect way i n which the unconscious can influence us is through an act of pe r s oni frcation (turning objects, moods, things into persons ).\"' When a primitive man anthropomorphized a rock, projecting unconsciously his subjective mental contents onto objective reality, this was per- sonification; and when we now d r eam of a \"wise old man,\" that too i s th e p ersonifica- tion of all o f o u r i n h e r i ted p sychic experi- ences with wisdom, authority, cunning, and so forth. The other category of prim ordial images Jung termed trans forming archetypes. These are not necessarily personalities, but include typical situations, geometric figures, places, and ways and means that express the kind of transformation that might be taking place within the personality. We w il l b e d e a l ing with transforming archetypes when we take up Jung's psychotherapy; some examples are the circle, quaternity (a set of four ), and most important of all, the sel f By and .large, t ransforming archetypes emerge when t h e personality is moving for change and partic- ularly that balancing change that will result in a total personality. Table 2 presents a list of Jungian archetypes. Note that the shadow is an archetype. It will play an important role in psychotherapy, along with the anima. The ego and persona are not listed in th e t a ble because most of their content i s c o n s cious.

Fairy tales usually have interesting combina- tions of archetypal identities, and Jung often used such children's stories as examples of his theoretical outlook. The best approach to an understanding of the archetypes is to take up these constructs a s they emerge naturally i n t h e Jungian topic under consideration. One term that we s hould know at t hi s p o in t i s d o m i n a nt (s). In some of his writings jung seemed to use this term as synonymous with archetype,\"' b ut with this usage he also had in m in d a special instance of archetypal manifestation. He seemed to use it when stressing the actual functioning, the bringing to bear of an arche- type into the stream of m e n tal f a n t asy — as d uring a dream, reverie, or other f or m o f imagination.

Here is the heart of Jung's position. Instinct is not an i s olated' thing, n or c an i t be isolated in practice It always brings in .its train archetypal contents o f a spiritual nature, life itself as an energy process, one that was always directed toward some goal. He said, \"Life is teleology par excellence; it is the in- trinsic striving towards a goal, and the living organism is a system of directed aims which seek to fulfill themselves.\" \"' Energies are therefore expended in relation to goals, pre- sumably even in the physical sphere, but un- questionably so in th e p sychic sphere. Self- direction or s u bjective direction i m p l ies a capacity for conscious, willful choice.\"' Jung saw this as an ego function in the personal- ity,\"' and i n o p p osition to the tvil/ he sug- gested an instinct concept. \"According to my view, all those psychic processes over whose energies the conscious has no disposal come w ithin the concept of the in stincts.\"\" ' W e say that our behavior is instinctive when our e go does not wi l l f u ll y d i r ect it , s o t h a t i t a ppears to be happening automatically.\"' I t rarely occurs to us that t h ere may be ot h er complexes with their own i n t e ntions bring- ing this \"automatic\" behavior about.

Assume that as the ego was developing, the socially ac- ceptable behaviors were b e in g o r g a n i z ed (agglutinated via adhesive model ) into this ego complex. Over this same period of devel- opment, all of those pleasant mannerisms we put on in public — the politeness and cheeri- ness when we feel rotten, the pretended con- c ern about the health of p eople whom w e basically dislike — would he going to form our persona complex (masks ). Since each of the good and stronger aspects of behavior has its opposite possibility, we can think of several behavior potentials which have not been in- corporated into consciousness.

Now, unless we are aware that we do in- deed have a shadow, and that those immoral and unfair behaviors we see in o t h ers are actually in u s t o o (as rejected alternatives under projection ), we will begin to develop a one-sidedness in our psyches. Another type of one-sidedness occurs when we identify our e gos with our masks, when we t h in k t h a t t he superficial face we s how t o o t h e r s i s really who we are. This also makes us likely to be manipulated by the group (see p. 195), because the group sets the styles incorporated by the persona. complex.

We h av e symbolized this at step 3. Note that as the complex forms, as the contents of the unconscious agglutinate, all kinds of mental contents may go to make it up. Thus, a complex might include not only those things we never were — never did before — but also various archetypal identities can form into the complex by way of symbolic al ex- pression. The archetype at step 3 is the small star-burst moving up from the collective un- conscious to agglutinate with the other con- tents of the complex. We will have more to say of how archetypes do this when we take up Jung's theory of psychopathology (see espe- cially Figure 15 ). The shadow does not al- ways combine into the complex, but usually i t does and so we p r esent it t h i s w a y f o r simplification. Since the newly forming com- plex has considerable libido at it s d i s posal, thanks to the extensive repressions and the o ne-sidedness of the individual, it can n o w e merge into c o n sciousness under it s o w n power (step 0). This is what we were allud- ing to above ( p. 188), in r e f erring t o t h e sudden change that came ov er \"good old Charlie.\" When th e s h adow-in-combination with other u n c onscious factors comes into consciousness, it presents the other side of the personality.

Causality versus Synchronicity Surely the complex that emerges into con- sciousness, popping up from below as a cork might break w a ter l e vel i f r e l e ased from one's grasp beneath the sea, must be thought of as a completely self-contained, determined entity. Jung cautioned against the naive view that we h u m ans are w ha t w e c o n sciously think we are as a personality. \"The truth is that we do not enjoy rnasterless freedom; we are continually threatened by psychic factors which, in the guise of 'natural phenomena,' may take possession of us at any moment.\" \"' Not only are we i n fluenced by unconscious personal forces in Jungian psychology, but the psychic inheritance from antiquity enters in to direct our fate to some degree.

A hard d eterminist believes that everything t a kes place as i t h a d t o happen, and that events could not have gone otherwise than they did. A soft d e t erminist claims that although m any t h i n g s had t o h appen as they did, a t l e ast s ome o f t h e events that took place could have gone other- wise (see Chapter 4, p. 262 for a discussion of determinism ). Even better evidence justifies the cl aim that Jung actively rejected the hard d e ter- m inist's position. Probably more t h a n a n y other psychoanalyst, Jung wrestled with th e problems of whether or not it is possible for t he cause-eRect principle to explain all t h a t w e know of h u ma n b ehavior. W he n j u n g used cause e fject he-re, he referred to e ff 7cient causation (see p. 2 of the Introduction for a discussion of the v a r i ous f o r m.s of c a usa- tion ).

Ad justment Mechanisms Repression versus Suppression Jun.g believed that repressions start as volu ntary su p pres sions, that we actively try to keep something disliked (bad) out of consciousness, and then in time the boundary between consciousness and unconsciousness is crossed by the nega- tive mental content and a repression results.'\" The reasons for repression were as varied for Jung as they were for Freud (see Chapter 1 ), but of course, J ung did not fi n d q u i t e s o many sexual involvements in repressed mate- rial as Freud did. Sometimes we might di s- l ike feeling g u il t o v e r o u r b e h a v io r a n d actually repress a mora/ i mpulse to do t h e right thing for past sins and take our medi- cine. In this case, the right impulses become a bad alternative because we do not want to be punished, so we end up r e p r essing our better side. Projection versus 1ntrojection. W e h a ve a l- ready seen that Jung made extensive use of the projection construct. He vie wed this as unconscious and automatic,\"' i n m o s t c a ses resulting when one individual transfers psy- c hic contents onto another.\"' O n l y t h e u n - conscious can project, and this mechanism is o ne of the oldest in the hi story of h u m a n - ity.\"' What w e a ctually do i n p r o j ection is to blur th e d i s t i nction between subjective and objective experience.

Once the personality is balanced Jung spoke of it as having achieved uholeness, so that all three of t h ese meanings interrelate. Jung also used the t erm co m p e nsate in a special way, as when he suggested that the anima could compensate the persona.\"' We will take up this usage below, when we dis- cuss Jung's approach to psychotherapy. Disci' erentiation (Discrimination ) and Opposi tion. Since Jung used these terms to explain the adjustment mechanisms, we should con- sider them as such. Repression was further explained as a. loss in differen tiation b etween the conscious and unconscious, or projection was said to be a failure in discrimination be- tween subj ective and obj ective experience. Jung believed that the human being's ability t o make such differentiations is due to t h e principle of opposites. Since we can readily s ee duality i n e x p e r ience, we ca n a l w a y s split it up into that and not that, many times - over. A period of time in the bathtub is en- j oyable, but when the w ater is too ho t t h e experience is not w h at i t is ot h e r w i s e. As infants and children, we break up our experi- ence through such oppositional contrasts even before we have words to n ame t h i ngs hot or cold. Identifi cation, P ossession, Numinous, Assimi- lation, and In flation. In t h e c l a ssic psycho- analytical sense, Jung would accept identi fication as one type of i n t r o jection, and he — as when we take in (introject ) a parental a ttitude and make it ou r o w n .' \" H o w e v e r , when Jung used this term in th e context of a nalytical psychology, he w a s u s u a ll y r e - f erring to i m i t a t ions of on e a s pect of t h e personality by another. We have already seen this above, where we said that the ego could identify with the persona (see p. 187). It is also common in Jungian psychology to hear of the ego identifying with a potent complex that has emerged from unconsciousness into consciousness (combining th e shadow ) .\"' Since this complex might also bring an arche- type into its constellation, Jung occasionally referred to an identifi cation with the arche type.'\" Wh en this happens, Jung would say that a possession has taken place, in that now the personality is under direction by uncon- scious meanings which have fixed on a sym- bol to almost hypnotize the person. To cap- t ure this idea of a p o wer u n der w h ic h t h e individual falls, Jung borrowed a term from R udolf Otto : n u m i n o sum.\" ' A n u m i n o u s mental content occurs to th e p e r son as an idea, hunch, or even an image of what some- thing is or is about to become in some really i mportant sense. Something bi g i s a l w a y s taking place in a numinous mental event, so that it is sensed as containing a p ower be- yond reason. These are superhuman con- ceptions which often im ply t h a t s o mething divine is being expressed. The idea, which arose in ancient Jerusalem, that \"God is born o n earth\" was an example of such a nu m i - nous idea. A l ess-benign example was the one mentioned above (p. 195), of how a c ommunity fell under the dorrunant in t h e Nazi swastika. This symbol had a numinous q uality about it . A l m ost a l w ays, w hen w e have a numinous experience developing in a single personality or in a collective group, there is an archetype involved. If the ego identifies with the complex or the archetype contained within it , an i n /a- tion o f the personality can take place.\"' I n even referred to it as un c onscious imitation"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"C hapter 3 The Analytical Psychology of Carl Jung 2 0 7 other words, the ego can presume that it has the superhuman power (numinosity ) of the complex causing it to inflate its importance.'\" Assume that a man has the idea that he is the son of Satan. jung would say that this man h ad, upon forming a c o m plex through t h e steps of Figure 12, constellated a daemonic power (Lucifer ) archetype in i t a n d n o w has identified with these contents to presume that he is an offspring of the devil (or is the devil himself ) . The same would g o f o r a woman who thinks she is the Blessed Virgin Mary (that is, a variation of the Earth Mother archetype; see Table 2 ). Another term th at Jung sometimes used to describe a special type of i d e n tification — really a u n i f i cation — was assimilation. By this he meant the en- veloping of one psychic identity by another, so that the engulfed identity is l i t erally no longer differentiated in the personality. Thus, Jung said the self could assimilate the ego in toto, which would not be a good thing for the personality.\"' Progression versus Regression. Jung took these terms from Freud but modified them to suit his own purposes (see p. 47). Pro@res sion w as interpreted teleologically \"as t h e daily advance of the process of psychological adaptation.\" \"' Regression, on the other hand, was the \"backward movement of libido\" that t akes place when th e p e rson i s t r y i n g t o recapture something important in his or her past.\"' Al t h ough he r e f erred to something l ike it in a f e w o f h i s w r i t i n g s , Jung did not really make use of the concept of Pxa- tion. Regressions happen all right, and libido (life energy ) is blocked resulting in a r e - experience of early memories — even reaching back into the racial history — but this is seen d ifferently from Fr eud due t o Jung's teleo- logical interpretation of l i b i do . S o m ething that is telic works forward, as a reason that is being expressed or an end (telos ) toward w hich life i s p r o g ressing. If l i b i d o fl o w e d backward at some point, it w o u l d s eem to be reversing the usual course of telic advance.

The going back is only the first step in a total effort t o r e i n state more balanced progression. The perfectionist now admits to occasional errors and laziness, the pessimist now confesses having a spark of o p t i m i sm f rom time to t i me , an d s o o n . L i f e ' s p r o - gression is now more whole than before. Constellation and Mobiliz'ati on. By constella- tion Jung meant: \". .. the fact that the out- ward situation [external life circumstance ] releases a psychic process in which certain [psychic] contents gather together and pre- p are for action . . . . The constellated con- tents are definite complexes possessing their o wn specific en ergy.\" '\" T h i s d e f i n i t i o n stresses the energic potential, the fact that a significant amount of l i b id o i s m a d e av ail- able for an organizing of p sychic contents. In terms of our adhesive model, however, we can say that the psychic meanings that are constellated have been mobilized into a single b ody of importance or significance.'\" T h i s is so because J ung did in fact speak of th e mobilization of complexes like the shadow, for example, or he referred to the mobiliza- tion of one's psychic virtues as a first step toward self-realization.\"' 1ndividuation an d T r a n s c e n dence.

Jung used this concept of transcendence to d e scribe th e p r o c e ss whereby all of the opposites and group pres- sures are finally united in the personality.\"' Time-Perspective Constructs Jung did not work out the elaborate psycho- sexual levels that we find in Freud (Chapter I).

This criticism stems from his telic in- t erpretation of p r o g r ession, libido, an d s o on.'\" If l i f e i s o r i e n ted t ow ard goals in a p urposive sense, then what does it ad d t o retrace our theoretical steps in order to find the presumed meanings of the past > Even so, jung did outline some general periods in the life cycle. prehistoric developmen t of consciousness by humanity.\"' He stressed the influence of our r acial history enough t o s u g g est t ha t o u r true fathers and mothers are not our parents b ut our g r a ndparents.'\" C h i l d re n ar e n o t born empty-headed or tabula rasa, said Jung (see p. l l of th e I n t r o duction for a d i s cus- sion of this concept ).

R ecall that consciousness begins in t h e child's differentiation of I or m e (subj ective identity ) from that or i t (objective reality ). This is the first step in acquiring knowledge, a nd it occurs through the p r i n c i ple of o p - p osites. But th e second step i n acquiring knowledge takes place when the infant puts two psychic contents into a (meaningful ) re- l ation, such as t y in g t h e v i s u a l i m a g e o f mother to the sensations of satisfaction from taking in n o u r i shment (drinking milk ).'\" The child learns \"mother brings milk to me\" even before this insight can be put into actual words.

A fleeting \"possible intention\" of t h i s s o r t is repressed because of its inappropriateness; later in life it mi ght come back as a \"mem- ory.\" Actually, we had never fantasied sexual copulation with our parent in infancy at all.

Th e o l d e r p e r s o n m u s t never look back, but rather \" l oo k i n w a r d .\" People at this age have a marvelous chance f or individuation because they h av e n o w lived long enough to experience many dif- ferent situations as well as t h ei r o p p osites.

In continuing the teleology which is life into an a f t erlife, these archetypal sym- bolisms are to be cultivated, personified, and understood as important psychic necessities. Immaturity Rather than Fixation Jung admitted that there is a t endency for people at all ages to look back to an earlier time in life when things seemed to be work- ing out better for them. The teen-aged boy w ishes that he could h ave t hat f e eling of simple certainty and security that the protec- t ion of the p arental home had g i ven h i m . The married woman of thirty wishes she had the freedom of her teen-age years. The aging man of sixty wishes he had the vigor of his thirties. All of these natural desires for a re- p lay of the l if e c y c l e are normal enough. Life is challenging, there are constant deci- sions and commitments to be made, and one might easily sentimentalize about a bygone If the individual has not actually become free from the childhood environment with its dependency upon parents and other adults, l eading to an i m m ature outlook on l i f e i n adulthood, Jung would call this immaturity Individual-Differences Constructs Jung was very sensitive to the problems of t yping people, and he u n d e r took th e t a s k with some reluctance. He felt that when we name a type, we are speaking about statis- t ical averages and not about people.\"' T h e danger in this is that the theorist may force his conceptions onto others in a n a r b i t r ary way, more to justify a point of view than to capture the accuracy of the in d i vidual case. For his part, Jung wanted a scheme that c ould capture th e o b v i ou s c o m p l exity o f behavior yet also not l ose th e o p en-ended features of the psyche. He was interested in the general problem of how it w a s t h at w e came to type personalities in the first place. J ung therefore turned t o h i s t o r y , and he studied a number of earlier typologies to find some common thread among them. Thanks to his scholarly approach, Jung moves us in his book Ps ychological Typ e s (1946, first published circa 1920 ) over the ages from the early Greeks like Plato and Aristotle, through t he thought of c h u r c hmen l i k e T e r t u l l i a n and Origen, down to the more recent views of psychologists like Friedrich Nietzsche and William James.

He named this bipolar dimension the in t r o ver sion versus extraversion polarity in p s y chic attitude. Thus, for example, Nietzsche's Apol- lonian and James's tenderminded types were introverted in psychic attitude, and the op- posite types of Dionysian and toughminded were extraverted.\"' T h i s c l a ssification was helpful, but Jung also needed a way of ex- plaining how th e v a rious psychic behaviors we know of as t h i n k i ng, seeing, or feeling were ordered mentally even before we could s peak of them as taking place in an i n t r o - v erted or e x t r averted manner. Basing h i s line of theoretical development on the nature of the psyche as an active agent, Jung then named a series of what he called functions. as well as conscious ) psyche to judge what is taking place, whether events change, what the potentials of any item are for the future of the person, and so on. As Freud could do (see p. 44), Jung oc- c asionally gave his constructs both a p s y - chological and a n e n e r g i c i n t e r p r etation. Thus, Jung defined t h e fu n c t i o n ps y c ho- logically as \"a certain form of psychic activity that remains theoretically the s ame u n d er varying circumstances.\"\"' C o n s idered ener- gically, a function was a constant libido ex- penditure, a means of keeping li bido chan- neled into a fixed activity. If w e n eed some basic continuity in the psyche so that we can recognize changes by way o f c o n t r a sts to these regularities, then how many such func- t ions are necessary to c o ve r o u r p s y c h i c needs> Since these needs are like structural features of the mind, we m i gh t h ave taken them up under ou r s t r u ctural-construct dis- cussion. We did not do so because they were written specifically for individual differences. Jung felt that four fu nctions could properly account for the basic psychic equipment of human beings, as follows: There are four aspects o f psychoLogicaL orien tation, beyond tvhich nothing fundamentaL remains to be said. In order to orient our- seLves, ue must have a function uhich ascer- tains that something is there (sensation ); a second function tvhich estab''shes what it is (thinging),' a third function u hich states whether it suits us or not, wh ether see nish to accept it or not (feeLing); andafourth ' function which indicates u here it came from and where it is g oing (intuition ).\"' The functions are part and parcel of th e psyche. In one sense they define the psyche in action. In theory, all four fun ctions begin as conscious psychic activities,\" 0 but in short o rder we begin to r el y o n o n e o r t w o i n c onsciousness rather than al l f o u r . B e f o r e Basic Functions o f the Psyche Jung's construct of function can be thought of in tw o w a y s : a s a p s y chological or a n energic (libidinal) tendency to remain con- stant in order to ju dge the changing condi- tions of experience. Judgment always calls for a fixed standard or frame of reference against or within which to r elate what we are con- sidering. For example, we us e a s t a n dard measuring unit (ruler ) to judge whether one fish is really longer than another. Knowing that our finances are fixed by a certain level o f income, w e c a n j u d g e w h e t he r s o m e desirable item (like an imported sports car ) is to be considered a potential purchase or n ot. The psyche needs its set of fi xe d c o - ordinates within which to evaluate and order the many sensations, feelings, hunches, and ideas that arise in the course of life.

In this sense, thinking and feeling must always con- Even so, Jung considered both thinking and feeling to be ra t ional functions.\"' W e tend to think of emotional decisions as prone to be illogical and to that extent nonrational. But Jung was driving at the fact that both t hinking an d f e e l in g ar e c o n c erned w i t h judging the worth, truth value, significance, or import of a m ental content. This always involves a subjective factor, because what is valuable to one person may not be valuable to another. Thinking emphasizes truth versus falsity or pl ausible versus implausible, and sensation function. f eeling emphasizes like v e r sus d i s l ik e o r attraction versus repulsion, but in either case the point of the function is to judge or assess, and the very essence of rationality is ju dg- ment, the making of decisions, or the choos- ing of an alternative. The other set of opposites Jung called the irrational functions. H e did n ot m e an t h a t they are contrary to reason but m erely out- side of the province of reason. They are not psychic functions that have as their role the directed judgment and assessment of mental c ontents, but r a t h e r t h e y m a k e p s y c h i c material available so t ha t s u c h r e a soning processes can be carried out.

This man t e n d s to forget appointments, and he has to count o n his wife to keep the bills paid on t i m e . He can be stubborn at times and is not al- ways worried about what others think when he gets this way. His ! m practical ideas often give his behavior a childlike quality, but here again he is not upset when others consider him to be eccentric in any way. As we might recall from his biographical overview, Jung was himself an introverted type, and he be- lieved the twentieth century is an age of ex- traversion, a difficult time for th e i n t r overt to live. By claiming introversion or extraversion is fixed by nature, Jung may appear to have built a one-sidedness into his theory. This is not really correct, however, because the prin- ciple of opposites is used in the case of the attitudes as in the case of the functions. Thus, if the superior function — whether by nature' s prompting hand or otherwise — adopts an ex- traverted attitude, then the inferior function o ffsets the tendency by adopting an i n t r o - verted attitude. Reaching back through history, Jung con- trasted Plato (introvert ) with A r i stotle (ex- travert ) and then later Kant (introvert ) and Darwin (extravert ).\"' Aristotle and Darwin surely placed considerable emphasis on the importance of external fact-finding, whereas Plato and Kant w ere more concerned with the internal workings of mind per se. Jung also gave examples of personality types that combined his functions and the extraversion- introversion attitudes, and we will n ext sur- vey a number of these observations.

In order to balance oR any tendency to one-sidedness, we have to confront the other side of our conscious per- s onality and see that we are also what w e are not! We accomplish this balanced over- view by way of the transcendental function. How do we achieve this confrontation with the unconscious> The transcendental func- tional process involves \"a sequence of fan- tasy-occurrences which appear spontaneously i n dreams and v i s i ons,\" \"' w h i c h a c t a s pacers of the individuation process in psycho- therapy. If we w ere to t ak e t hi s d i scussion further, it would carry us into Jungian psy- chotherapy, so let us now put the concept of transcendence aside until we once again pick it up in th e r elevant section. However, this would be the appropriate point at which to introduce another personality term that Jung u ses and that we w il l a l s o t ak e up i n t h e general context of individuation during psy- chotherapy. The mana personality is a kind of inflation of the conscious personality. Con- sciousness becomes puRed up when a mana p ersonality forms, and t h er e i s a d e c i d e d rejection of unconscious factors at this time because the person mistakenly assumes that he or she knows all there is to know about the psyche. In a ctuality, consciousness has been possessed by this very unconsciousness. Primitives often acquire this sense of per- s onal power in their tribal rites.'\" I n a w a r dance the primitive man can w or k h i m s elf into a state of fr enzy and l i t erally feel th e surge of power (mana) taking over his con- sciousness as he dashes oR to do battle. Jung argued that even the modern individual can l ose his or her identity in th e r eality of t h e m oment as a crowd m e mber, and t hen i n response to the collective promptings (arche- types ), swell up into a self-proclaimed super- person. In fact, this is what occurred during the rise of Nazi Germany, when crowds not o nly fell under the sway of a W o t a n (war g od) archetype but t h e mana personality dominant as well ( see p. 195).'\" A n o t h e r time when an individual is likely to develop a mana personality is when th e i n d i v i dua- tion process misfires. Individual as Coll'ective Identity J ung made it clear that he could not t h i n k of the life of a people as in any way diRerent from the life of an individual. \"In some way or other we are part of a single, all-embrac- ing psyche, a single 'greatest man,' the homo m aximus, to q u ot e S w e denborg.\" \"' T h i s collective identity has a history, one that is \"written in the blood\" but also shows itself through individual behavior, so that it is the person who moves history rather than vi ce versa.'\" To d i Rerentiate between individual people, we must at t i m e s d i f f e r entiate be- t ween the groups of people to w h i c h t h e y are historically related.

He di d n o t say that a Jew (or any Semite ) is incapable o f understanding E u r opeans. H e m e r e l y claimed that in order to do so, the Jew would have to make use of a p s ychology written specifically for the European's unique history. Jung's supposed anti-Semitism stems from a misunderstanding of what he was claiming about the psychology of c o l lectives. Thus, Jung made the point that the Jewish people — because of a h i s t ory o f s u p p r ession by other \"races\" (nationalities, and so on ) — had n ever acquired that tie to th e l and t hat t h e European had achieved. The Jews were un- able to own land in m an y o f t h e c o u ntries w here they w er e a l l o we d e n t ry , m a k i n g them fluid and mobile in both the economic and the psychological spheres of life. Even as they moved about without ties to the land, t he Jewish people were acquiring a h i g h level of culture, so that Jung said they are more civilized as a people than are Europeans. Now here is the point of c o nfrontation be- tween Freud and what j un g c onsidered his Jewish psychology. Since the Jew is not as barbaric as the European, he can look into his unconscious with less threat of a danger- ous upheaval than can the European.'\" Whether Jung was correct in hi s cl aims about the Jewish character and its supposed weakened tie to the land — particularly since not nearly so important for our pu rposes as t he recognition that j u n g w a s a p p l y in g a construct to a people in th e same way th at we are accustomed to apply such constructs to an individual. Jung was prone to do this in many of his writings. For example, he was critical of the tendency of the European per- son to ape the m ental exercises of Eastern p eoples. Many people wr ongl y t h i n k t h a t J ung advocated the study of y o g a o r Z e n Buddhism as a balancing tactic in their lives. Actually, Jung was opposed to the pr actice of yoga for a European, because the latter's p roblem is not one that w i l l r e s p ond t o a greater control over consciousness — which is yoga\"' — or to the utter submission to the unconscious promptings of nature — which is Zen Buddhism.\"' Europeans must flnd their own \"way\" (Tao), because they have evolved a certain history, one that stamps their pecu- liar nature, and one that cannot be borrowed from another historical tradition. T herefore it is sad ina'eed u hen the Eur o pean departs from his otvn nature and imitates the East or \"a f jects\" it in any u a y . T he possibilities open to hi m t v o ul d b e s o much greater i f he r vould remain t ru e t o himself and' evolve out o f his otvn n a ture all that the East has brought f orth in t h e course o f the millennia.\" The most serious problem facing modern humanity is its one-sidedness.

The rise of Nazism, the decline of moral fiber, even the conflicting schools of modern art w ere seen by him as early si gns of t h e u n c o n scious upheaval closing in on the one-sided materi- alism of Western society.

Modern W estern humanity still has time to t ur n i t s attention inward and thereby not only recoup lost possibilities but extend its level of self- realization.\"' Male versus Female Psychology The final individual-difference constructs to which we might refer in Jungian psychology c oncern masculinity an d f e m i n i n i ty . C o n - sidering the conscious personality first of all, J ung claimed that women are ruled by t h e principle of Eros (Love), whereas men are ruled by the pr i n c i p le o f Logos (Logic). Women are thus guided as conscious per- sonalities by a capacity for relating to others Eros relates to the binding, uniting, and also l oosening and separating of p o r t i ons f r o m the whole. This includes not only life-giving (birth) activities, but interpersonal contacts u nion, no t a s e x u a l c o n t r a c t . \"For her, marriage is a relationship with sex th r ow n i n as an accompaniment.\"'\" A m a n ' s c o n - sciousness, however, is ruled by l o gical ob- jectivity, interest in specifics, discrimination, sions. judgment, and in sight ( which is wh y t h e thinking function is more often superior in the male). L o gos r elates to t h o u g ht, con- fidence in fi n d in g s o l u t ions, and c e rtainty in drawing c o n c l usions.\"' J udging fr om t hese conscious principles, it w o ul d f o l l o w that as a compensating manifestation, the un- conscious should present us with a contrast- ing psychological picture. And so it does. Jung found rather early in his studies that male patients often r eported f e m i n ine-like m oods in t h ei r d r ea m s y m b ols, an d c o n - versely, women reflected opinionated mascu- line styles of symbolic expression. He viewed these as tied to the archetypal manifestations of the animus ( Latin for \" m i n d \" ) and the anima (Latin for \"soul\" or \" l i f e-giving prin- ciple\" ). The animus, which i s t h e refore f ound in t h e u n c o n scious of t h e f e m a l e , arises at times in symbols to compensate f or the female's conscious attitude a s u s u ally manifested in the principle of E r os.

The extent of dis- t urbance we eventually suRer from will d e - p end on th e number of i n c ompatible op- posites we generate in living, and how soon it is before we attempt to compensate for our lack of balance. According to Jung, \"the vast majority of mental illnesses (except those of a direct organic nature ) are due to a disin- tegration of consciousness caused by the ir- resistible invasion of unconscious contents.' \"' He never totally rejected his early theory that certain mental disorders — particularly those in the family of schizophrenias — might some- day be traced to a metabolic toxin of some sort.'\" But Jung's unique theoretical contri- bution lay, as had Freud's, in the explanation of the functional disorders. Jung traced the autonomy of complexes to their emotional core (feeling tone ). He em- phasized that emotions behave as the more primitive thought processes once had for early humanity; that is, they are not willfully pro- duced by people but simply happen to them. We can even see this happen to us if we are under a great deal of e m o t i onal stress, as when character traits that shock us emerge against our will. We later say, \"I don't know what came over me,\" as we recall behaving in an excessively jealous, spiteful, or self-pity- ing manner following a frustration in life.\" ' If this sudden c hange takes place in o u r n ormal behavior, imagine what i t m u s t b e l ike for th e a bnormal person.

W e find t h e p s y c h o tic p a r a n oi d s a y i n g, \"Someone has me under electronic control, t rying to force me to do things I do n't w a n t to do.\" Insanity is thus an invasion from the unconscious of contents that are flatly incom- patible with the intentions of the ego. There- fore, the intentions of these shadow contents (complexes ) cannot be assimilated into con- sciousness. By assimilation, Jung meant ac- cepting and integrating (constellating ) these f ormerly repressed contents with t h e m o r e opposite of assimilation is dissociation, which i s another way of e x pressing the f act t h a t t he personality is being split apart b y c o n - flicting intentions. W hen a complex is a c tive w i t h i n c o n - s ciousness, we are as if i n a d r e a m s t a t e , with conscious and unconscious factors mix- ing together without assimilating each other. A dramatic example of t hi s w o ul d b e t h e multiple personality forms of hysteria, in w hich two o r m o r e p e r s onalities seem t o take over consciousness in turn; actually, the original conscious personality (the one fash- ioned before the illness ) remains out of direct contact with the emergent personalities (the ones formed via the illness ). The latter, sec- ondary personalities (complexes ) invade con- sciousness and push the original personality aside, keeping it therefore in the dark as in the Jekyll-Hyde conflict of the classic tale. In the same way, lesser complexes as part-person- alities within consciousness can make them- selves known to the ego even though the ego f amiliar elements of c o nsciousness.'\" T h e"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"222 M i x e d K a n t ian-Lockean Models in Classical Psychoanalysis Part I may feel they are not part of its identity. The person may say, \"I know that at times I lose control and do some pretty crazy things. But I am not myself at t h ose times. Something ' clicks' in my head and I c a n't control my - self.\" At other times, the ego may not even be aware of the operation of a complex with- i n consciousness side by side with it s v e r y routine behavior. Such a person may black- out for brief periods and not recall his or her atypical behavior during this time.

Take a dream, for example, which is a simple type of pro- j ection: by p u t t i n g i t s c o n t e nt s i n t o t h e dream, the unconscious makes it possible for the ego (consciousness ) to learn — with the help of th e t h e r a pist — what \"that\" d r e am means to \"me.\" In time, through such study, the ego may be able to assimilate the incom- patibilities of the complex as projected into the dream. The ego learns that the meanings of the dream are not foreign to the person- ality, but merely represent another side to the personality.

When an individual for any of a number of reasons no longer attends to the prompt- ings of the collective (superego ) to balance, let us say, a one-sided pattern of selfish be- havior, serious consequences are likely to de- velop. This person is essentially saying, \"I k now what I a m d o i n g i s w r o n g b y c o n - ventional standards, but I don't give a damn.\" Maybe, were he or she to examine the be- havior further, only modest changes would b e called for.

Though he was suspicious of the collective mentality and did no t w an t t h e i n d i v i d u al to be easily swayed by it, he also believed that there was much wisdom in certain collective promptings born of past ages in meeting life' s challenges.

Jung was critical of both Freud and Adler for downgrading the spiritual needs of hu- man beings. He felt that they had too readily accepted the premises of nineteenth-century science and thus had become overly material- istic in outlook.\"' H u man beings are morally r esponsible, they have a n i n t e l l ect w h i c h evaluates and strives for a better purpose in life, no matter what that judgment of better i s based on.'\" In f a c t , Jung drew a parallel between the conception of sin and that of re pression Once the h.uman mind had invented a sin concept, people had no alternative but t o conceal or r e press their sinful p r o m p t - ings.\"' And since they invariably see alterna- tives open to behavior which are si nful, a psychic division into conscious good and un- conscious bad choices is possible. These latter, repressed contents take on the coloring of a secret, which of course means that the indi- vidual nursing secrets is likely to be cut oR from the support of other people.\"' Secrets are divisive mechanisms which permit indi- viduals to shrink back from external reality and remove themselves even further from the ethical tenets of their society. Evasion always plays a role in n e urosis. \" If we follow t h e history of neurosis with attention, we regu- l arly find a c r i t i c a l m o m en t w h e n s o m e problem emerged that was evaded.\"\"' In addition to suggesting that people may fall ill for lack of a conscience, Jung said also that some people develop neuroses because they fail to live up to their potentials. He said t hese are usually people of a h i g he r t y p e , who simply have never gotten t h e mselves u nderway in l if e s o t h a t t h e y h a v e m u c h m ore to give than they now r e v eal.\"' F o r example, a young person with exceptional in- tellectual skills gradually l oses i n terest in c ollege, drops out, and drifts i nt o a p e r i o d of living aimlessly, relying heavily on alcohol and drugs to get through the day. The indi- vidual eventually conquers this addiction, but f rom then on li ves a simple lif e o f m e n i a l work, never thinking about anything. Grad- ually, the person begins to feel uneasy and complains of nightmares in which he or she i s being given the \"weight of the w o r ld\" t o shoulder. The person also questions every- thing to be done and cannot seem to make the simplest decisions anymore. Jung would s ay this complex formation was due to t h e young person's \"retarded maturation of per- sonality.\" \"' People like this need to achieve self-realization so that th eir a b o v e-average potential may be realized. Average people can live average lives successfully, but a naturally s uperior person is living one-sidedly at th e average level. Meaning Creation and Symbols in I/lness One of the reasons why some people develop a neurosis is because they have no p r oper symbol through which an archetype can ex- press meaning in consciousness and thereby facilitate a balancing of the personality. Sym- bols are like bridges between the conscious and unconscious portions of the psyche.

The archetype comes to direct the ego, which is itself then said to be po ssessed by the archetype. For example, th e p s ychotic young man who thinks himself a great savior of mankind by senselessly killing a popular political figure might have fallen under the numinosity of a h e r o a r c h e t y pe, p ossibly constellated (agglutinated ) with the w i z ard archetype because of the supposed cunning involved in laying his murderous ambush. In t his instance, the poor deluded ego w o u l d have no understanding of the meaning of its a ctions. It would h ave been th e t oo l o f a shadow complex dominated by the archetypal themes of salvation, retribution, and devious- n ess. Of course, not all o u tcomes of n u m i - nous experiences are so horrible. Anything that acts on the individual ego with a great intensity and urgency is numinous.'\" ties with stored libido (numen ) releasing this l ibido in the act of c o m pensation with t h e goal of answering the question posed (\"Why was I born>\" ). However, since no symbol in consciousness is available through which a rchetypal promptings in the form of l i b i d o release are expressible, the only alternative is for the libido to reflow or regress. Regression is not giving up the compensation, but rather cycling back again to the roots of the collec- t ive in hopes of achieving a rebirth.\" ' O n the right-hand side of Figure 15, we have the other possibility in which a bridging symbol is available, so that now the li b ido released by the archetypes (numen ) does achieve a c onscious-meaning expression. The w o m a n can now communicate with her unconscious, assuming that she has the insights of analyti- cal psychology to help her. Her collective un- c onscious has something to say about wh y she is living and what is to be expected of her as a member of the human race. Symbols that act in the way just outlined were termed symbols o f trans formation, be- cause they transformed the libido from a po- tential (numen ) to an actual expression of meaning.\"' J ung believed that human beings need to symbolize like this just as much as t hey need to eat and drink.'\" I f w e c a n n o longer find meaning in th e symbols of our forefathers, then we must find new symbols or risk falling out of touch with our roots- as embodied in our primordial images which define for us the very nature of our human- ity.'\" This can be very dangerous. Not all symbols are of the t r ansforming variety, of course. As we can recall from our discussion of complex formation, an arche- type can constellate into a complex which is forming and then make its eRects known in c onsciousness, even though i t i s , s t r i c t l y speaking, of th e u n c o nscious. This occurs when the ego identifies with th e c o m p l ex active in consciousness. In a manner of speak- ing, the ego slips into unconsciousness by way ¹u r o sis versus Psychosis Precisely when a neurosis will appear depends on the degree of one-sidedness evolved in liv- ing and the consequent possibility of keeping the constellated complexes under repression. jung did not feel that all neuroses have their b eginning in the first five years of l i fe.

However, because of his psy- chological explanations of all m e ntal i l l ness based on t h e s t y l i z e d -meaning-expression model (complexes, dissociations ), Jung must actually be counted as holding to the quanti- tative view as regards neurosis and psychosis (see p. 87 of Chapter I fo r a d i s c ussion of this issue ). Jung saw m any p a t i ents mov'e f rom neurotic to p s y chotic states in t h e i r lives, and he rejected the suggestion that they might have been latently psychotic all of the Psychosis is therefore an extension of the division of personality that begins in complex formation as a neurosis.

It is the polarization of seemingly incom- patible opposites in the personality that brings on mental illness, so what t h erapists must do is to bring the two halves of the client's psyche back together again.

Jung called this therapy a form of he r m e neutic treatment.\"' The zoot of this word is from H e r m es, the messenger of the Greek gods. Hermes thus brought meanings (information, messages ) to the gods from various places. During the Middle Ages, theologians adopted the ter m hermeneutics to convey what they were doing in the Holy Scriptures. That is, they were trying to find every bit of i n f o r m ation that was presumably there, including semihidden meanings i n symbols and th e i m p o r t o f things that might not ha ve been said when they should have. In like fashion, the Jungian therapist helps a patient extract from his or her unconscious all of those meanings that are potentially t h e re , s e eking e x p r ession through symbols of transformation in corn- pensation for the one-sidedness of conscious- ness (see Figure 15 ) . Symbols therefore \"compensate an unadapted attitude of con- sciousness.\" \"' They are an essential ingredi- ent of the curative process, but they can cure only when experienced as a living phenom- enon in psychic life.'\" It is not enough to know the meaning of our dream and other fantasied symbols. We must confront the implicat ions of the symbol and make a decision as to which side of the question we will l iv e on, preferably accom- plished by turning the complex that troubles us into a person (personification ). For ex- ample, if th e p e rson discussed earlier had failed to move to a better Iob location and d enied that this wa s du e t o a s t r o n g d e - pendency on family and friends, the neurotic complex that m i gh t t h e n h a v e d e v eloped would have dependency as a central theme. The conscious ego would consider itself suc- cess-oriented and independent, but when the n eurotic complex appeared, it w o ul d h a v e definite signs of dependency and fearfulness involved. In order to clear up this split in the personality, it would be hest if th e neurotic complex could be turned into a person (per- sonification ) with whom consciousness (ego) could openly debate and discuss the course of life to he followed (confronta.tion with th e unconscious ). By personifying our other half, we can speak with it and hash out all of the attitudes it represents and come to some form of balanced overview which takes both sides into consideration and accepts them more or less. This solution is not al w ays completely satisfying to either consciousness or uncon- sciousness; hut then, that is the nature of life! Jung once referred to the course of analytical treatment as \"rather like a r u n n i n g c o nvex- sation with the unconscious.\" \"' The Stages o f Psychotherapy In order to help the client achieve a state of psychic balance, Jung encouraged the analyti- cal therapist to promote a kind of di alectical process in the therapeutic relationship (see p . 8 of t h e I n t r o d u ction f o r a discussion of dialectic ).\"' By p e r m i t t ing a c o m p l etely free and equal climate to emerge in the re- lationship between therapist and client, spon- taneous and o p e n c o n f r o n t ations s h ould emerge between participants. Not only does the relationship take on dialectical coloring, but the internal dialogue between conscious and unconscious contents are also viewed as dialectical in nature.\"' Jung insisted that the prime rule of hi s t h e r apy was t o c o n sider each case uniquely and to give a patient com- pletely equal status in t h e t w o - p erson en- counter.\"' Indeed, the therapist is constantly in thexapy with each client and can therefore make no claims to superiority except in the sense that he or she has devoted more hours t o personal insight and t h e r efore ma y b e somewhat more balanced than th e average"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"230 Mi xed Kantian-Lockean Models in Classical Psychoanalysis Part I knows for certain that elucidation has begun when such projections appear.\"' Jung had many things to say about transference over the years. He began hi s t h e orizing r a t h er traditionally, viewing transference as a special type of projection in which pa.rental (mater- nal or paternal ) imagoes are attributed to the therapist.\"' H e a lso spoke of l i b ido ca- thexes which had been fixed on the therapist and needed to be removed and reinvested in the patient's personality after t r a n sference had been resolved.\"' This is all very similar to traditional Freudian theory (see Chapter 1 ) . However, Jung was to e x p and o n t h e c onstruct of tr ansference, and i n t i m e , h e even dismissed its importance in cure. As we k now from C h apter 1, fo r F r e u d a t r a n s - ference was the sine qua non of psychother- apy. Jung, on the other hand, eventually said that he did not th ink t r a nsference onto the doctor was a necessary precondition for ther- apy to take place.\"' Other forms of projec- tion could serve the course of t h e r apeutic insight equally well. Jung viewed th e client's sexualized ef- forts to relate with the therapist as a gross distortion of th e f u n d a m ental social bond uniting all people.\"' N e urotics do not want sex with the therapist, but rather a true social relationship which they cannot take responsi- bility for establishing. In the positive trans- ference, we therefore see neurotics giving love in hopes of receiving direction in their lives as children do. Because they are adults, they sexualize this love. The patient submits to the therapist as a slave to the master. Since regression also accompanies the p r ojection of unconscious contents, there is often con- siderable infantile acting-out in the relation- ship. The therapist can be made into a father, mother, or even a combination of p a r ental figures. In the Jungian view, it is even possi- ble for a patient to project himself or herself a s an imago onto the therapist,'\" T h i s i n - tensified tie to the doctor thus acts as a com- p erson. But this experience is never to b e used as a club over the client's head. The course of a n a l y tical p sychotherapy can be broken down into four stages. These are not clear-cut, nor is i t n e c essary for a person to carry out all four steps in order to get a positive outcome from therapy. In the opening sessions with a client, the therapist finds the stage of con fession developing quite spontaneously. Jung said this was the goal of the cathartic method introduced by Breuer and Freud (see Chapter 1 ). Cathartic re- lease proves that a neurosis is more than just an intellectual problem. To clear it up there must be some involvement of the emotions as well. Doubtlessly catharsis — making con- fessions — was the means employed by people for centuries to balance. A sin is really the beginning act in a move to split the person- a lity between what ought and w ha t o u g h t not be done in l i fe. I n t h e n r e pressing the guilt over sinning, we ensure that a complex will someday arise around these very denials. Confession alone will no t s erve to b a l ance the personality of everyone, but Jung felt that certain rather uncomplic ated p ersonal- ities can actually gain full therapeutic benefit from regular use of the confessional (for ex- ample, the Catholic sacrament ). As the sessions slip by, the therapist will find the client moving out of a confessional mood and wanting to explore his or her past life. This gradual change signifies that the second stage of therapy, called elucidation, is begin- ning. To elucidate is to make clear or explain something, and this is what the therapist be- gins doing. T hi s e x p l anatory process stirs up the client's psyche and in short order he or she begins projecting (positive and /or negative ) u n conscious contents onto the therapist. This is trans ference, and a therapist"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"C hapter 3 The Analytical Psychology of Carl Jung 2 3 1 pensation for the patient's faulty attitude to- ward reality.\"' The aim of transference is clearly the re- e stablishrnent of r a pport w i t h r e a l i ty , t h e uniting of th e split i n t h e p e r sonality that has forced the neurotic into a continuing re- treat from life. If the doctor and the patient lack mutual understanding, the break from life is not likely to be restored. Once the pa- tient realizes that he or she has been project- ing onto the t h e rapist, the t r ansference is resolved, and the stage of elucidation comes to an end. Before this can happen, however, any countertrans ferences w hich may e x i s t must also be resolved. It is i n e vitable that countertransferences will develop in the rela- tionship because \"ail proj ectionr p rovo( e counter proj ections.-\" \"' T h i s i s w h y Jung claimed that the therapist is constantly work- ing at his or he r ow n t h e r apeutic advance with each client seen. Jung once observed that \"a therapist with a neurosis is a contradiction in terms.\" \"' T hi s m ust be the case, because a sick therapist would have no ability to sense the unconscious projections likely to pass be- tween doctor and p a t ient. I n c identally, in Jungian therapy a patient has as much right to identify (interpret ) countertransference as the doctor has to identify transference.\"' The third stage is that of ed u c ation, in which the therapist helps the client to learn about all of those personal and extrapersonal things he or she has found lacking as knowl- edge or behavioral alternatives in the past. The emphasis shifts now to the present, where concrete efforts are made to change behavior. Naturally, such changes are dependent on value judgments, and the client has as much to say about what will b e changed as does the therapist.\"' jung believed that Adler ac- tually began his therapy at about this stage of education, whereas Freud had been content with ending his therapy at the close of eluci- dation. Since jung believed that we seldom get rid of an unhealthy psychic state by simply understanding it, he felt it was necessary to train the client to live a more satisfying life a fter we ha d p r o v i ded i n s i gh t a b ou t t h e past.'\" Jung did not offer any set recipe of training aids at this point. W h a tever needs d oing in the u n i qu e l if e h i s tory w il l h a v e been made plain by this time. The selfish or timid person will m ak e c o ncrete efforts to meet and lend aid to others. The narrow per- son will begin reading more widely, earning a broader perspective on life. The too inter- personal activist will learn to enjoy solitude, a nd so on. The therapist will h ave to l e n d moral support to the client at t hi s t i me, en- couraging him or her as a person would coax any friend to develop more fully. For many clients these first t h ree stages w ill suffice, and therapy w il l n o r m a ll y b e ended. However, occasionally a therapist will discover a special client whose problem is not curable by a therapy that aims at normalizing people. These individuals have potentials be- yond the average, and hence, \"that it should enter anyone's head to educate them to nor- mality is a nightmare.. . b e c ause their deep- est need is really to be able to lead 'abnormal' lives.\" '\" When a client of this type appears, t he therapist has to move to th e f o u rth an d highest stage of therapy, trans formation. Selfhood ancI Individuation via the Tranrcena'ental Function The stage of trans formation is a completely unique view of the therapeutic process, which no other major therapy has ever quite cap- tured. It demands that w e b r i n g t o g e t her many of the terms learned above to describe the process of self-realization or s e lf-emer- gence. The general process by which we ac- complish this self-realization Jung called indi vidttation.

Thanks to the libido generated by the tension of opposites between shadow fac- tors and consciousness (ego sphere ), there is an enlivening of psychic processes.'\" It does no good to try to destroy the shadow com- pletely or to project it oB o nt o o t h ers. We must learn to live with our shadow and even take strength and direction from an interper- sonal association with it by wa y o f p e rsoni- fication.\"' One might reasonably expect Jung now to claim that the shadow must be personified and confronted in the process of transforma- tion. Yet, this is not precisely how the con- frontation with the unconscious comes about. Rather, it is the anima, standing directly be- hind the shadow, so to speak, and directing the shadow's actions in the psyche, that must be confronted in personified form.\"' Jung's usage of the term anima in this sense is cap- tured in the following: \"I h av e defined the anima as a personification of the unconscious in general, and have taken it as a bridge to the unconscious, in other words, as a func- tion of relationship to the u n conscious.\" '\" Why does the anima complex now take on the meaning of our e n t ire unconscious life in place of the shadow> There are two rea- sons for this technical adjustment. First of all, Jung did not w ant th e ego confronting and defeating the shadow during transforma- t ion because — in line with hi s v i e w o f i t s utility — the shadow must continue to have a role in the psyche foLLouring individuation. Second, and d o u b tlessly mor e i m p o r t a nt, Jung had the anima stand as representative for the unconscious during transformation be- cause this is what h e d i scovered happened in his own c ase, during hi s p e r sonal self- analysis. In describing his self-analysis, Jung said that he was prone, when under a state of tension, to do something with his hands — to paint a picture, hew a stone, or record some- thing (a fantasy ) in w r i t i ng . T h i s c r eative urge made his moods concrete, for he literally made them come alive in t hi s seeming ar- tistic activity. One day, while he was writing down some fantasies which had been actively pressing upon his consciousness, Jung was prompted to ask himself a q u estion. Some- t hing happened then which b r o u ght h o m e h is theory of complex formation in a m o s t dramatic and uniquely personal way; that is, a voice independent of his conscious control answered his query, as follows: When I uas writing down these fantasies, I once asIted myseL f, \"What am I r eaLLy do- ing? Certainly this has nothing to do w i t h science. But then what is it?\" W h e r e upon a voice seithin me said', \"It is art.\" I wa s aston- i shed.

Once out in the open of consciousness, the anima was found to h av e decided opinions in opposition to t h ose of Jung — that is, his ego. She told Jung that he was doing something \" arty,\" an aesthetic ex- ercise which had no real significance except possibly as a kind of pleasurable pastime. J ung did not accept this view. I f al l h e was doing was \"art,\" then the balancing process would have no personal significance. In other words, the anima was resisting indi- viduation by detracting from its importance. And since the anima u as Jung — that person- ality which he was unconsciously — what we see here is one part of Jung resisting therapy. H is conscious personality, his e go, w o u l d have no part of this resistance and countered w ith an argument of it s o w n . I n t i m e , t h e anima accepted Jung's vocal cords and re- sponded to his counter with the logic of the female. And so it goes — the constant struggle of opposites, separated into polarized identi- t ies over the years and no w c o m i n g t o a confrontation by way of a n i n t e r nal debate of the attitudes to be taken toward life. The anima is a great threat to conscious- emerge the victor. If consciousness is to win out, then it must press its case unflinchingly. U ery often the shadow side of s uc h a r g u - ments are illogical and therefore because of such inconsistency they can be shown to be impractical. Even so, the conscious viewpoint (of the ego ) must accept the fact that these are arguments of the personality system, com- ing back today because they mere rejected and unrecognized earlier. Take Jung's anima ness because in this internal debate she could"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"234 Mi xed Kantian-Lockean Models in Classical Psychoanalysis Part I attitudes, for example. Since the anima dis- credited Jung's psychological eRorts to bal- ance as art, we might surmise that she was returning all of t h ose nonscientific attitudes that Jung may have rejected in the past. Jung may have, as a younger man, been so anxious t o appear the p e r fect scientist that h e r e - pressed any suggestion that hi s a n a l y tical p sychology was even slightly \" t a i n ted\" b y art. Now, when the complex that had formed around this and other attitudes returned, it had precisely this formerly rejected point of v iew to express. He was doing art and no t true science after all! \"' Many of the anima's arguments hit home, and they alter our conscious attitude (speak- i ng now f r o m t h e p e r s pective of a m a l e client ) toward our parents, our careers, our v ery selves. But since the anima is a t t h i s point necessarily one-sided, we cannot submit to her pronouncements completely. We must depotentiate her lest we simply move fr om one type of one-sidedness (conscious ) to an- other type of one-sidedness (unconscious ) by identifying with he r v a lu e system (be pos- sessed by her ) . What we need is a balancing wholeness and therefore transformation i s always concerned with educating the anima (or the animus for the female ).\"' How does j u n g g e t t h e i n d i v i d u a t i on process underway> He tells us that he asks a patient to take some aspect of a dream or possibly just any fantasied image which has occurred to him or her and then to elaborate or develop it spontaneously. \"This, according to individual taste and talent, could be done in any number of ways, dramatic, dialectic, visual, acoustic, or in th e f or m o f d a n c i ng, p ainting, drawing, or modelling.\" \"' Fo r ex - a mple, a client might t ak e an i m ag e o f a m ountain which keeps coming into hi s o r h er dreams, and then paint it o r s c u lpt i t , or try to capture its monumental impact by writing about it or dancing about it in some spontaneous fashion. Quite often this reduces the frequency and vividness of the mountain i mage in dreams. Why > B ecause now t h e meaning coming through this symbol of the mountain (hermeneutically ) is being d ealt with a'irectly. By creating the \" a r t i stic\" pro - d uction, we are creating th e m e a n ing t h a t presses on our consciousness from the other side of consciousness. The mountain is that symbol of the right-hand side of F i g ure 15 that creates meaning. In time, we will be able to personify the anima or animus, and then the balancing effort to depotentiate it begins and hopefully ends with totality rather than f urther one-sidedness. When this totality i s achieved we have successfully individuated, that is, become a new individual! Thus Jung referred to india'iduarion as a \"process of dif- ferentiation,\" \"' or as the \"process by which a person becomes a psychological 'in-divid- ual.' \" '\" Since it balances all sides including potentialities not yet r e a lized, we can also think of it as the process \"in which the pa- tient becomes what he really is.\" '\" The purpose of the dialectical process of confronting the anima is to bring these con- t ents into consciousness, but then w e m u s t also break up these personifications for they a re autonomous complexes with t h ei r o w n supply of libido (numen ).\"\" If we can break t hem up, then w e c a n m a k e use of their l ibido stores in a h e a l t hy, b a l ancing w a y .

To demonstrate this process of i ndividuation we must bu ild o n t h e m o d e l for symbolic-meaning creation in Fi g ure 15 and the centering of the personality of Figure 16. Figure 17 combines these two features into a schematization of th e i n d i v i d uation process. We have our familiar egg-shaped psyche in Figure 17. Note that at point 1 we show libido regressing into unconsciousness where t he shadow is being j o i ned b y t h e a n i m a archetype with its numen (stored libido ) to constellate into a p o t e n t i a ll y a u t o n omous complex. The more one-sided the personality becomes the larger is this unconscious com- plex (which could include other archetypes a s well as th e a n i m a a r c h etype and t h e shadow ) . When t h i s unconscious complex g ets large enough, it w il l e m e rge i nt o t h e conscious realm, particularly when prompted to show itself as by Jung's question or by a symbol of transformation like the mountain image. In the latter case, the mountain image might be personified via the Wise Old Man of the Mountain, such as a leprechaun or a gnome from a children's fable (see Table 2 ). This is what we have pictured at point 2 of F igure 17. Now , t h e a n i m a a n d t h e ego confront each other as opposites. The series of six lines looping between the ego and anima at point 2 signify the tension of dia- lectical exchange as these opposites wrestle for control of the personality. At point 2 the shadow is for all practical purposes ihcldded within th e a n im a ar che- type. The anima i s a c t ually no w e q u a t ed with unconscious contents a nd the ego i s equated with conscious contents of the psy- che. By the time we reach the stage of trans- formation, most of the persona factors would have been confronted and removed during elucidation and so forth, so we have not in- cluded the persona complex at point 2. The task now facing the ego, which has essentially invited the anima to a confrontation by ask- ing it to assume a personified form, is to de- potentiate the anima and t hu s b a l ance the personality. The dialectical confrontation (de- bate, discussion, feeling-toned expressions of preference, and so on ) between these two identities continues over points 2 and 3. Note that at point 3 we show the self be- ginning to take form, emerging as an arche- typal symbol from the collective unconscious. But before the self can r e ally em erge (be realized ) as an actual point of i d e ntity, the anima will have to be depotentiated. If the anima is depotentiated, then its numen will be used by the emerging self archetype to form an identity point at the very center of the personality (a la Figure 16 ). If the anima is not displaced, then of course a self-bridge would not f or m t o c e n te r t h e p e r sonality. We show at point 3 that a depotentiation has i ndeed occurred by having a k in d o f b u r s t - ing of the anima complex, with it s e n ergy gravitating to the emerging self which now is actually constellated into an identity. At the same time the shadow leaves to return to it s customary level of unconsciousness. Point 4 is then a schematized version of a successfully individuated personality. Note at point 4 that the self acts as a bridg- ing pipeline through which li b ido can now How in bo th d i r e ctions. Instead of h a v i n g f ree libido regressing as at point 1 i nt o t h e unconscious each time the conscious person- ality opts in favor of on e b e h avior pattern o ver its opposite, we now h a v e f o r m e d a major identity which can accept both sides t o the personality. We h a v e r e t a i ned t h e polarity of the personality. There is still an ego in consciousness enacting the good be- haviors (that is, the chosen alternatives we show to others ) and a shadow in the uncon- scious constellating the bad behaviors (those"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 The Analytical Psychology of Carl Jung 237 only we know about ourselves completely ). The self looks in both directions, accepts both sides, takes strength from t h e m u l t i p l i c ity and contradictions of the personality which both \"is\" and \"is not\" a t the same ti m e . Note also that the i n d i v i duated person no longer needs to use a persona complex. The individuated person is a genuine human be- ing who no longer hides behind masks. The emergence of the self presents some problems for the ego, which is in many ways displaced and itself defeated by the arrival of a new focal point fo r t h e p e r sonality.\"' T he self is closer to th e i n f e r ior t ha n t h e superior function on the basis of which the e go has been operating; wit h t h i s s h if t i n emphasis the ego is threatened.\"' Similarly, if the ego-dominated consciousness has taken on an extraverted coloring it must now find meaning in t h e i n t r o v e rted c h aracteristics brought to light by self-emergence.\"' This is a ll very upsetting to the ego, which in f a ct does not always give up its important posi- tion without a fight. There is often a dialec- tic carried on between the ego and the self, except that in this case there is no depoten- tiation and in fact the self always prevails.\"' The point is, our ego is a very biased, short- sighted psychic complex. It ha s n o p r o p er appreciation of the historical antecedents of humanity. The self, on the other hand, takes a much larger view of things. In fact, Jung once re- ferred to it as an objective ego, meaning that the self has a m or e u n i v ersal character.\"' The self originates in an archetypal prompt- ing and then emerges into consciousness by way of a symbol, or else the libido, set free by the depotentiation of the anima, and the numen of the self archetype will not be put at the disposal of consciousness to solidify t he self-bridge. Jung called a s y m bol t h a t converts energy in this fashion a libido ana longue. s\" The libido analogue is thus a special case of the symbol of transformation, which emphasizes the role o f s e l f - emergence in the personality. Li b id o a n a l ogues channel libido and change the form it takes from the f orm of the anima to th e f or m o f t h e s e l f . We refer to libido analogues when we ar e c oncerned with symbols of th e s e lf, w h i c h we will take up below. Another benefit of individuation, in addi- t ion to b a l ancing th e p e r s onality, i s t h e widening of consciousness that occurs, even though the individual no w a p p r eciates the i mport of unconscious factors in his or h e r life.\"' This is a typical Jungian paradox: we enlarge consciousness through r ecognizing the importance of the unconscious (especially the collective factors ). Jung once defined the transcendental function as \"getting to know the counterposition in the unconscious\" and he gave an example of how some such in- s ight could be mentally helpful i n t h e f o l - lowing comment: \"A Ch ristian of today, for instance, no longer ought to cling obstinately to a one-sided credo, but should face the fact that Christianity has been in a state of schism for four hundred years, with the result that every single Christian has a. split in his psy- c he.\" \"' T h u s , s omeone with a r e l i g i o u s problem is not out of step with hi story.

Sometimes, when it is near defeat the anima can deceive the ego by appearing to depotentiate, only to have at t hi s precise point in time a substitute archetype take its place with the express purpose of so fascinat- i ng the ego with it s p o wer o f i n s i ght t h a t the ego will be possessed (that is, identify with the substitute ). By doing so, the anima succeeds in having the unconscious direct the life and time."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"238 Mi xed K antian-Lockean Models in Classical Psychoanalysis Part I conscious after all. Jung called this replace- rnent for th e a n im a t h e ma n a p e r s onality (see Table 12 where ma na is l i s t ed as a n archetype ). Recall that mana conveyed extra- ordinary potency (numinosity ) to the primi- tive intellect. Th e e g o i n fl a t io n r e s u l t ing would usually come about as follows: at the point when the anima seems to be depoten- tiated several insights are achieved by the ego. The ego has benefited from the creative ef- forts during the fourth stage of th erapy. It now feels as if it had conquered the uncon- scious and that it no w k n o w s a g r eat deal about all aspects of the psyche. Sometimes these insights are frightening, so that Jung speaks of a positive or a negative type of in- Ration.\"' But th e point is: the ego becomes drunk with power over its success in forcing the anima to withdraw and seeming even to depotentiate. What may really be happening is that in t aking credit for t h e d e f eat of t h e a n i m a , the ego has actually identiFied with a mana a rchetype and slipped into a s t at e o f t h e mana personality. This is most likely to hap- pen if the ego has become deeply involved in mythological themes, which hold great fasci- nation (numinosity ) for h u ma n b e i n gs.\"' Tales in which a person is said to have made a pact with th e d e vi l i n o r d e r t o a c q u i r e daemonic power are essentially based on this dynamic of an identification with th e com- bined mana and devil archetypes. Manics or paranoids who try to convince us that they have unusual talent in business or political leadership might seem very convincing — since they are, after all, speaking from an unusual perspective ( out of t h e unconscious ) — yet something smacks of th e e x treme, the ex- cessive, and the overly pat in their urgent re- q uests for ou r m oney or v o tes, an d w e instinctively draw back from them. Some peo- leaders. pie do not. They follow such mana person- a lities believing t he m t o b e c h a r i s m a t i c If the mana personality evolves in therapy, t he client begins once again to m ak e p r o - jections onto the therapist, thereby reviving t ransference. This is on e o f t h e s i g n s t h e therapist uses to recognize this setback in therapy.'\" The client might begin to idealize the therapist as a m a gical healer (positive transference ) or criticize the therapist in any of a number of ways (negative transference ). Sometimes this criticism seems warranted, so that in either case, if the therapist is unfa- rniliar with th e m an a p ersonality dynamic, he or she may be fooled into believing that the neurosis has been cured. Sometimes these mana personalities profess to be a n alytical therapists and extend the Jungian therapy to lengths that offended the founder of analyti- c al psychology. In several of h i s w r i t i n g s , jung expressed concern over these supposedly enlightened healers, many of whom h ave a social action program in mind to \" m ake this a better world.\" They are not co n s cious of their unconscious direction (possession ), and h ence it is a case of the b l in d l e a ding t h e The correct way to h andle a m an a p e r- sonality is first, to recognize it, and second, t o repeat the p r o cess already ou t l ined i n F igure 17, only this t im e w i t h t h e a i m o f depotentiating the mana p ersonality rather than the anima.

T his representation is t ru e t o Jung's prin- ciple of opposites, which continues to operate after individuation is completed. As noted above, having depotentiated the anima — and possibly also the mana pexsonality — the ego still needs its polar opposite against which libido may be generated. The self acts as the continuing vehicle (bridge, pipeline ) for the balancing of thi s d i alectically generated li- bido, and the contrast provided actually vital- izes the personality as a whole.\"' The question remains: is i t p o s sible to individuate the personality in other than an analytical setting> Could a person self-realize in a general life setting, for example> Jung felt this was possible. In fact, he thought of the individuation process as quic (ened mat uration, a term he borrowed from G. Stanley Hall.\"' He m e ant that just as many people mature into a far-reaching wisdom over their life span, particularly in the latter half of the life cycle, so too does the ind i v i duated pa- tient in analytical therapy acquire a v i sion of life beyond his or her years. Such people m ature befoxe their t i me, bu t t h e y m i g h t have done so in any case. Symbols of Trans formation in Mythology, Religion, and Alchemy We come now to a p ar t o f a . n alytical psy- chology that has probably done more to give jung the reputation of being mystical than any other aspect of his theory. Believing as h e did that s y m bols cured t h r o ug h t h e i r molding of insight by way o f t r a n sforming l ibido,'\" Jung was fascinated by the m a n y ways in which he found humanity trying to correct for its collective one-sidedness thxough the manipulation of a r c h etypal syxnbols- that is, symbols through which an archetype may be seen expressing its particular mean- ing. The main archetypes of transformation discussed by Jung are the quaternity and the mandala, and we shall lim it o ur c o n s idera- tion to these two because not only are they in a sense identical, but they in cl ude i n t h e i r meaning virtually all of the organizing, uni- fying, or balancing symbols he discussed. The word ma ndala i s Sanskrit f or \" c i r - cle,\" '\" and quaternity (from the Latin quatre, meaning \"four\" ) refers to geometrical figures having the property of being divisible by four, having four sides or four directions, and so on. If we consider a circle or a four-pointed (-sided, and so on ) f igure, it is easy to see that analogies to totality or w h o l e ness are relatively easy to come by. Circles impel us to consider their centers, as we draw our atten- tion within the circumference, hence inward"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"240 Mi xed Kantian-Lockean Models in Classical Psychoanalysis Part I to the heart of the figure, very naturally. As- suming now that a personality needs to sym- bolize a centering tendency, as stylized in Figure 16, for example, what m or e ap pro- priate image could we select than a circle> And so it i s t h a t i n a n a l y t i cal p sychology any circular, spherical, or egg-shaped forma- tion which appears in dream or waking fan- tasies is considered a mandala symbol. Some common examples of mandalas are wheels of various sorts, eyes, flowers, the sun, a star, rotation (including a swastika! ), snakes hold- ing their t a i ls, enclosed places like court- yards, and whirling about centrifugally (like the dervish dances ). Bringing mandala and quaternity symbols together, Jung said the m ost common forms o f m a n d a l as are the flower symbol (twelve or sixteen petals focus- ing our attention on the pistil ) and the wheel symbol (eight or twelve spokes focusing at- tention on the hub ), but he also noted that a frequent symbol for the mandala was the cross (focusing attention on the union point of the four-sided structure ). The number four is a common quaternity s ymbol, of c o u rse, including al l n u m b e r s divisible by four (as the flower and w h eel e xamples just c i t e d ) . Thu s i f a p a t i e n t dreams of four ugly witches mixing a pot of some sort, we might interpret it as a quater- nity (four) and a mandala (the round pot ) c onstellated into on e d r e a m t h e m e . T h e fourth point is said to e x p ress a balancing tendency in the psyche. One is single, two is only half-complete, three adds a tension calling for a complete coverage, but only four gives us that w e l l -rounded, spatially com- plete image as the four points of a compass (direction ) , the four sides of a b o x (com- plete enclosure ), and so forth. Jung claimed that the primary colors of red, blue, green, a nd yellow reflect a quaternity, as did t h e early speculations on the nature of the un i - verse in terms of the supposed basic elements of earth, fire, water, and air.\"' I t i s n o a cci- dent that Jung has four steps in his therapy, with the fourth being the one during which balance occurs. Jung reminded us that pri m i t ive peoples often insist on a more fantastic explanation of birth than their own good sense would sug- gest. For example, they might go on claiming that sexual intercourse has nothing to do with pregnancy, even in the face of their personal experience or the proof being given them by civilized peoples. Jung also underscored a tendency that any mother might find true of her child. That is, children not only seem to prefer a mythological explanation to a scien- tific or a truthful one, but they often simply \"forget\" the scientific explanation when it is forced on them. A seven-year-old child will n ot always give up his or her b e l ief in t h e stork or Santa Claus simply because a modern parent does not want the child to believe in fairy tales and therefore informs the offspring about the facts of life. Jung believed that this fascination with myth is basic to the human being's capacity for abstraction. People are n ot really organisms designed to fi t t h e i r thought to the f acts of l i fe . B e sides, if w e must someday realize a self that is not itself real (factual ) but merely a possibility, then we have to develop a background of experi- ence with my thologies of v a r i ou s sorts so that we can transform when the opportunity arises. This is a vital human process, one that needs practice, and one that might be termed sp~'ri tual b ecause it i s n ot involved w i t h reality at all. As Jung summed its importance up, \"Side by side wit h t h e b i o l o g ical, the spiritual, too, has it s i n v i o l able r i g h t s.\" '\" Hence the gremlin was a symbol of a modern myth, b u t the archetypes that went i nt o i t s fashioning might have included the Trickster, D aemonic Power, an d p o s sibl y e v e n t h e Devil (Lucifer ) (see Table 2). Thus myths have a compensating role just"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Chapter 3 The Analytical Psychology of Carl Jung 24I. as dreams do. Myths arise from our uncon- scious, and they often make their first appear- ance in the form of a dream.\"' Jung defined t his feature of his t h eory as follows: \" M y - thology is a pronouncing of a series of images that formu.late the l i f e o f a r c h e t ypes.\" \"' Since archetypes express meaning about all kinds of experience, it is possible to have my- thologies reflected in s c i ence, religion, or political ideologies, that is, literally anything humanity finds itself doing. We do not make up myths, they are like the primitive thought forms that simply happen to us independently of our conscious will.\" ' T h e c o m p ensating balance that results when they m ake t h eir appearance can actually be thought of as an elongated individuation process.'\" Interpret- ing the mythological symbol is thus an im- portant part of i n d i v i duation in t h i s s ense. Jung did precisely this with fl y in g s aucers, a post — World War II p henomenon which he interpreted as the emergence of a modern myth.'\" Fl y ing saucers were viewed as pro- jected mandalas, put up in the sky by people needing a new balance within their psyches. In this age of science, when the old symbols (myths, religions ) are losing their capacity t o transform li b id o an d t h u s b a l a nce t h e personality, a new symbol and its underlying myth is taking form. Since there is often a religious twist given to the saucer myth, Jung took this to mean that people's spiritual needs are being projected in an effort to find a new relevance for the nonmaterial side of life in this materialistic age. Jung said on several occasions that the Ro- man Catholic church, with its wealth of sym- bolic rites and its liturgical dogma, holds a decided advantage over the Protestant sects (of which he was once a member ) when it comes to promoting individuated balance.\"' Religious belief systems excel the more ra- tionalistic systems of thought because they alone consider both the outer and the inner p erson.\"' Th e appearance of a papal bu l l (an oF icial document issued by the pope ) was for Jung a happy development, because this suggested that some of th e o l de r r e l i g ious s ymbols might no t b e d y i n g a w a y c o m - p letely.\"' N o t h in g i s m o r e d a n g e r ous t o modern humanity than the disappearance of such symbols, for they act as the media for compensating archetypal th emes. F u r t h er- more J ung held that people who d eny t h e patent fact that they are often moved by what can only be called a religious prompting are just as likely to slip into a one-sided neurosis as those individuals who refuse to admit that their religious faiths are occasionally shaken by doubt.\"' As to specific religious beliefs, Jung sug- g ested that the concept of a n eternal sop[ serves a good purpose. In the first place, by believing in a hereafter, the individual retains his or her teleological approach to life and thus maintains a sense of personal advance throughout the years on earth. Secondly, the average person's belief in a soul reflects the underlying possibility he o r s h e e n t e r tains that a unity can be achieved in the person- ality.\"' In t h i s sense, the soul is the bridge we can utilize to achieve that totality of per- sonal being most people refer to when they s peak of G o d (an archetype signifying unity ) .\"' Since, as we know, individuation calls for the emergence of a s el f s y m b ol , r e l i g ions might be expected to have created a self- symbol. And so they have: Christ is the sym- bol of selfhood, combining such opposites as God and man, inner and outer, divine and corporeal.\"' Christ also meshes with the Hero archetype,\"' balanced by th e o p p o site fact that he was also a victim. We can see in the myth of a man m ade into Go d t h e r i s e of t he self, the realization of th e m o s t n o b l e aspects of our human nature novv personified in the figure of Christ. The symbolism of the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"242 Mi xed K antian-Lockean Models in Classical Psychoanalysis Part I Catholic mass captures this in transubstantia- tion, which refers to the turning of bread and wine into the body and blood of C h r i st. In the same way that a man wa s t r ansformed into God, a priest now t r ansforms material of one sort into material of another, higher sort Th.e resultant sharing of this body by all the faithful in the act of communion brings about a totality which is i n a l l e s sentials a direct parallel to individuation in psychother- apy. Thus Jung can say, \"In this sense. . . we can speak of the Mass as the rite o f the individuation process.\" \"\" Jung had some very interesting, unusual views on the nature of religion and its my- thology.

Related to this was the issue of evil. Is evil an active principle in the world, as one might say that goodness is > If so, what is the relationship between God and the obvious existence of evil| The early Gnostics (theologians ) had speculated on this problem, and they had accepted the fact that God was both good and evil in H i s i m p a c t on human beings. Later, St. Augustine and others defined evil in t he n e gative sense as the \"absence of good,\" but Jung could not accept this definition because it seemed an o bvious denial of what we' know to b e t h e Writing in hi s a u t obiography, Jung tells u s that as a v ery y o ung ma n h e h a d t h e f ollowing insight r e garding th e G o d c o n - cept: \" God is not h u m a n . . . that i s H i s g reatness, that n o t h in g h u m a n i m p i n g e s upon Him. He is kind and terrible — both at once — and is therefore a great peril f r o m which everyone naturally tries to save him- self.\" '\" Jung was thus prone to refer to the \"dark deeds of God,\" \"' an d h i s i n t e rpreta- tion of the biblical account of Job, who suf- fered though he was a good man, was that God simply had no appreciation of the sup- posed evil He was inflicting upon Job. God gives and He t a kes away, an d f r o m H i s vantage point there was no real understand- ing of why Job complained so. Th anks to His confrontation with Job, God decided to b ecome human — that is, He sent H i s S o n d own to earth in th e f o r m o f a m a n . T h i s a ction provided God with a v i e w o f t h i n g s from the human being's slant.

He li ked to point out that even jesus taught us to pray the Lord's Prayer in the most quizzical fash- ion, and said, \" 'Lead us not i nt o t e m p t a- tion' — for is not this really the business of the tempter, the devil himselH\" \"' Because he viewed religion as an impor- tant part of human li ving, and he was also willing to talk about religious beliefs in the way that he did, many people honestly feel that Jung believed in the existence of God as a formal h y p o thesis within h is t h e o r y . Others think that he was deviously trying to bring psychology back to the older religious beliefs. Neither view is correct. Jung made i t quite plain that God i s no t r e al, for n o - where can He directly touch our lives. He is s ensed as a power within, bu t a s w e h a v e already noted, such a numinosity could just as well be considered daemonic as divine.\"' Psychology is in no position to m ake meta- physical statements of this nature in any case.

Actually, boiled down t o i t s e s sentials, the Jungian interpretation of alchemy is identical with the individuation theory we have been reviewing in terms of m y t h o l o gies and re- ligions.

One could say that its prototype was something aki n t o t r a n s u b s tantiation.

Alchemists also searched f or the basic substance that went t o m a k e up all things, thinking of t hi s physical mat- t er as a kind of d i v ine prison in w h ich t h e God spirit was confined; this was called lapis or the stone, or sometimes combined as the lapis stone. Alchemists thus set out to find the secrets of matter, which they believed contained the divine soul (self symbol ) as a captive waiting for release. As Jung said of th e a l chemist, \"His a ttention is no t d i r e c ted t o h i s o w n s alvation through G o d's gr ace, but t o t h e liberation of God from the darkness of mat- ter.\" '\" T h ese men w ere extremely devout, and the aim of changing lesser metals into gold or quicksilver was not to acquire riches. If such a discovery could be made, then we would have an empirical demonstration of the existence of God! D u r in g t h eir pseudo- chemical work, alchemists often had halluci- nations and other hysteroid states in which complexes of various sorts w o ul d e m e r g e and confront them in personified form. They projected their unconscious contents onto matter to such a degree that the product to be extracted from matter as a divine essence was called co@i tati o ( having to d o w i t h thought ) .\"' A c l e a r i n d i c ation that a n i n - dividuated self was being sought in the sym- bols of alchemy can be seen in the statement of Dorn, one of the famous alchemists Jung studied, who once urged his peers to \"trans- mute yourself from dead stones into living philosophical stones!\" \"' In short, just as the patient in psychotherapy works through art forms to individuate, so too did the alchemist w ork at his experiments in a n e f f o r t (un- known by him ) to fin d h i s unique self- i dentity.

The a l c hemists began t o make a distinction between the psychological (mystica ) and the material (physica) aspects of their study.\"' The older symbols lost their fascination (numinosity ), and men calling themselves alchemists were no longer seeking individuation so much as they were literally trying to t ur n l ea d i n t o g o l d .

The irony of modern times is that, though we profess an almost religious con- v iction that consciousness is all there is t o psychic living, we are steadily falling more and more under the direction of unconscious collective forces.'\" As his example, jung took the horrors of two world wars in his lifetime.

T hough Jung favored listening to th e c o l - lective promptings of t h e u n c o n scious, to learn from what these group symbols had to say, he rejected the reliance on collective solu- tions so many people advocate in m o dern times. He once observed, \"The steady growth of the Welfare State is no doubt a very fine thing from one point of view, but from an- other it is a doubtful blessing, as it robs peo- ple o f their i n d i v i d ual r e sponsibility an d turns them into infants and sheep.\" \"' Lest Jung seem an archconservative and r eactionary, we should add that he had an ethical view of how people ought to behave which, if f o l l owed, would l ead t o a s o c i al order in which variations and even contradic- tions in personal behavior would be welcome moral inclinations. Sometimes our automatic as uniqueness and individuality. Jung called b ehavior that is a ccepted from t h e g r o u p without a p ersonally reasoned basis moral behavior. As we a re g r o w i n g, o ur p a r e n ts and other important social influencers pro- v ide us with th e m o res of th e g r o up, a n d we accept these principles emotively, based entirely on the feeling-toned fact that t h ey are considered appropriate by everyone we know.

Jung admitted that suggestion plays a certain role in all therapies, but he distinguished be- tween conscious and unconscious suggestion.

But on the issue of wholeness and totality, there will b e a n i d e n t i t y b e t w een client and therapist, for t hi s i s w h a t s e l f realization means. The therapist must show the way in his or her ow n a d a p tation, and jung can thus say, \"The great healing factor in psychotherapy is the doctor's [balanced] personality.\" \"' The so-called transference re- l ationship is nothing more t ha n a r u n n i n g series of projections sent the therapist's way from the unconscious of the client. Interpret- ing the origins of these imago projections is helpful, but this alone can never produce an attitude of healthy adaptation toward life in a teleological sense. By reducing today's re- lationship attempts to yesterday's imagoes (see p . 230), we constantly frustrate that w h i ch the patient needs most — a feeling of rapport Therapeutic Techniques Dialectical Equality in the Relationship The prime rule of analytical psychotherapy is that it is a diaLectica/ procedure, in which the individuality of the sufferer has as much right to existence as do the theories and individu- a lity of th e d o c t or .\" ' T h e a n a l y t i cal p r o - c edure is dialectical in tw o w a y s : (1) the patient and therapist have equal rights in the dialogue,\"' and (2) the conscious and the un- c onscious square oR o n e q u a l t e r m s i n their confrontation.\"' Real change demands openness and equality with a n o p p ortunity for either side to express a point of view.

The neurotic person does not have to deny, lie, s in, keep secrets, or fight the m ores of t h e group anymore, because the path from which he or she had strayed so long ago has been rediscovered. where we now appreciate what Jung meant hy the \"hermeneutic treatment of imaginative ideas.\" \"' Symbols are not to be thought of as defensive maneuvers on the part of a client. R ather than covering up o r h i d i n g u n c o n - scious meanings, the symbol tries — as Hermes did for the g ods — to convey this meaning. Freud was w r on g t o d i s t i n g u ish b e tween manifest and latent dream content, because: \"The 'manifest' dream-picture is the dream i tself and contains the w h ol e m e a n ing o f the dream. When I find sugar in th e u r i n e, it is sugar and not just a facade for albumen.

The first, tied more closely to free association, Jung called am pli ficati on. He t ook this term from a l chemy, wh ere it r e - ferred to the fact that an a l c h emist would often let flow a series of psychic images and analogies while concentrating on his chemi- cal studies.'\" Though he failed to appreciate what was occurring, the alchemist was in fact enlarging upon the context of s om e arche- typal symbol which was expressing itself in his ritualized experiments and the theory he was following to justify them. T h i s p r ocess o f \"taking u p t h e c ontext\" is w h a t Jung m eant by amplification.\"' T h e c l i en t t a k e s up each prominent point of his or her dream, and then lets a spontaneous flow of imagery Hermeneutic Techniques o f Amplific ation and Active Imagination Jung always believed that the free-association procedure used hy Freud led to the uncover- ing of the same type of complex that he had discovered in his association experiments.\"' He therefore used various kinds of association t echniques in therapy, at t i mes giving t h e client clue-words or i m ages to r e spond to and also adapting the completely free associa- tive approach in which the client says what- e ver comes to mind spontaneously. In ti m e he came to the conclusion that free association is not enough for a complete elaboration of the complex through the symbols involved. We can get at the repressed complex through free association all r i g h t , b e c ause mental e vents are linked together in the mind w i t h 100 percent necessity (see Chapter 4, p. 266 for a discussion of hard determinism ).\"' In fact, we could probably start the association p rocedure with a l in e t a ken f ro m a n e w s - paper.\"' All roads lead to the complex in the psyche. But what we want in addition to this identification of the complex is a means of understanding what i t i s t h e u n c o n s cious wants us to do about the client's problems, the kinds of compensations to he made, and the change in conscious attitudes called for.

This is not the same thing as free association, because the client is not allowed to go from d ream image to t h ought an d t h e n r a m b l e on away from th e d r eam i m a ges as such. For example, if as Jung's patient we dreamed of a mountain scene, and then by concentrat- ing on this dream image we were reminded of a vacation last summer during which time we had a dreadful argument with our spouse, Jung would not consider it proper amplifica- tion if w e w er e t o g o o f f a n d r e h ash our marital problems — letting the dream per se slip from view. This would be a freely asso- ciated identification of a complex or problem area, but what he would hope to do in having us amplify is find out what the unconscious is saying to u s. Jung would therefore en- courage us as follows: \"Concentrate on the mountain scene. What is happening> What comes to mind > Describe it all in full detail, including any changes that might occur as you experience the succession of images.\" If we were to follow Jung's instruction, we might be surprised that our mind's eye will indeed begin to witness a scene of some sort, either limited to th e d r eam a s r e called or p ossibly even e x t ending b e y on d i t . T h e mountain might change its shape. Someone might begin falling down the mountain. We might find that f ro m b e h ind th e m o u ntain the sun was beginning to e m erge, and so forth. Based on the recall of the dream and a ny additional action that m i gh t o c cur i n the reactivated scene, Jung could now help us learn the broader meaning of the dream symbols that have emerged. He might draw a parallel with the fantasied mountain scene and some relatively obscure Norse legend about mountain folk who had great strength o f will.\"' T h i s m a y s t r ik e u s a s v ery o d d because not only are we rather timid and un- able to get hold of our l i fe, but we have al ways been somehow ashamed of our Scandi- navian lineage. In ti m e, Jung would show us that this is precisely what our c o llective unconscious is trying to cure t h r ough com- pensated dreaming. It is telling us essentia]iy to balance attitudes, to drop th e o n e-sided timidity and advance on life even as we take p ride in our n a t i onal r o o t s (the pride we c ould have taken years back but di d n o t ). The meaning of the dream is right there in t he manifest story line. One d r eam of t h i s s ort might not convince us, but i f w e w e r e t o have a number of them l ik e t h is, all r e - lating in some way to our personality prob- l ems and making th e s ame p o in t t h r o u g h dream symbols, we might begin taking our u nconscious seriously. Thi s i s w h a t Jung meant by hermeneutics, and in time he was to extend this technique to go beyond simply a dream context as such. This broader hermeneutic application is active imagination, which Jung defined as \"a sequence of fantasies produced by deliberate concentration.\" \" In a sense, this is a highly sophisticated form of daydreaming, which is w hat Jung was d o in g w h e n h e s t u m b l e d upon his own complex (see p. 232).

I n like fashion, it is often true t hat h u m an b eings symbolize their need for a r e t urn t o social intercourse (relationship ) with others by dreaming of sexual intercourse. The l a tter serves an analogical function for the former, so to speak. Over the years Jung had many opportuni- ties to make interpretations of symbolic con- tent — both in dreams and other rriythological, religious, and alchemical contexts. In order to give the reader some flavor of his style of symbolic al interpretation, we h ave l i sted a number of symbols taken from his works in T able 3. Note th e d e cided lack o f s e x u a l interpretations. Coming now to the practical style of in- terpretation, J ung would usually b e gin b y having his clients free-associate to a dream image on the order of Freud's approach, to w hom he gave credit as his teacher.\"' H e departed from t h e c l a s sic f r e e -association pr ocedure by voicing his own free associations in the dialogue to supplement the thi nking o f the clients.'\" S i nc e th e t h e r a pist i s i n therapy and many symbols have a collective Insight, Symbols, and the Strategy o f Interpretation Jung once said that the psyche needs to know just like the body needs food — and not just a ny food or k n o w l edge but t ha t w h i c h i s appropriate and n ecessary for e x i stence. \" The symbol is the groping means by which t he mind comes to k n o w i t s n e w m e a n - ings.\"' Symbols are made up of cultural con- t ents used a s a n a l o g ies an d m e t a p h o r s through which they can ex press meanings never stated before. It is as if the archetypes were by nature dumb, and in order to express their compensating significance, they had to reach out and fix on whatever it was that the mind had learned in it s p a r ticular culture. For example, if the theme of birth or rebirth is being pressed by the Self archetype during individuation, a fish image may be used sym- bolically in the dream as an analogy to a fetus in utero (both organisms surrounded by water; see Table 3, p. 250 ). The dream would be about fishes, but the archetypal theme in- volved would be (re)birth (individuation ).

This ther- apy series was not going well, and the next day he told the client that probably the rea- son it was not moving along was his fault. H e had been thinking less of her t ha n o f other people, and his unconscious was now trying to compensate for his conscious atti- tude of looking down on her by forcing him to strain in the opposite direction of looking up at her. The client admitted that she had f elt this countertransference attitude on h i s part, and from then on the therapeutic rela- tionship improved considerably.\"' J ung agreed with Freud t ha t n o p e r m a- nent harm results if a therapist makes an in- correct interpretation at any given point dur- ing therapy.

Regarding the kind of patient he saw in therapy, Jung ob- served: \"About a third of m y c a ses are not suffering from any clinically definable neu- rosis, but from the senselessness and aimless- ness of their lives; I should not object if this were called the general neurosis of our age.

Jung's principle o f opposition, t h r o ugh w h i c h h e a l w a y s seemed able to find one contrasting or con- tradicting mental content to o ff set an other, is reflected in this division of the psyche. We also have the ego opposed by the alter ego or the shadow, and every type of behavioral style manifested on one side of th e p syche h as its opposition on the other side. If t h e ego is introverted, the shadow is extraverted, and if the th i n k i ng-sensation functions pre- d ominate i n c o n s c i ousness, th e f e e l i n g - intuition functions color unconscious life with a style quite the opposite. It is ou t o f t h i s totality of opposites that Jung could eventu- a lly weave a balancing nodal point i n t h e emergence of the self, that unifying identity o f the complicated psychic realm, the o n e among the many. J ung's adhesive model o f t h e p s y c h i c s tructure was prompted by hi s early w o r k in free association, in which he felt that he had proven th e e x i stence of f e e ling-toned complexes. This theoretical notion of a com- plexity of mental contents — a complex — was then to provide the basis for all of his mental c onceptions. Complexes were said to f u n c - tion psychically under their ow n d i r e ction, and they could form anew over the life span of an individual. Some complexes like the ego, persona, and shadow seemed to form quite r eadily, thanks to t h e v e r y f a c t o f living. In l i v i ng, w e h ave to affirm c e rtain behaviors (ego, persona ) and deny o t h ers ply go away. The difficult thing in l if e is to somehow bring about an understanding and even a communication between the affirmed and the denied sides. This is what the self c omplex affords because it a ct s a s a g o - between and a representative of both sides of the psyche — the conscious and the uncon- scious. As Jungians, we always stress both sides of the psyche, because there is a sense in which the person begins life totally under t he sway of u n c o nscious thought, bu t n o t only a persona/ realm of unconsciousness. Here is where Jung built on the concept of the unconscious that Freud and Adler had employed. Keeping his pr inciple of o p posi- tion in mind, Jung essentially said that just as we have group influences on our conscious thought so too do we have group influences o n our u n c onscious thought. Ou r f a m i l y , social order, and civilization inHuence what w e think about the w o rld w e n o w l i v e i n . But so too does our h i s t orical heritage of others who have \"thought before us\" influ- ence how we t h in k t o d ay .

Th e w o r k in g o f the hand and th e w o r k in g o f t h e p s y c h ic apparatus have this common influence from out of the past. Hence, in the collective as- pects of our psyche there are general forms of expression, vaguely f r a me d a r c h etypes, which can be brought to bear in expressing some needed thought — a bright idea, a stroke o f insight — at the ri gh t t i m e . T h e s e p r i - mordial images are a p r i or i c a t e gories of possible functioning. We can personify them, turning them into living figures in our mind, or we can get to understand them through other forms of symbolical mediation. For ex- a mple, in a n o v e r l y m a s c u l i n e man the a nima archetype may enter i n t o a d r e a m calling him back to his feminirie possibilities; i n an overly feminine w o ma n t h e a n i m u s archetype can provide the opposite (mascu- line ) balancing outcome for h er.

Husserl called this approximation t o g e n e ra l a g r e ement intersubjectivity Th us his forma.l position on psychology was idealistic, as suggested in the following: Everything that in the broadest sense o f psy chology tve call a p s y c hical p h enomenon, tvhen looited at in and for itsel f, is precisely phenomenon and not n ature [that is, nou- menal existencej . . . 3 p h e n o m e.non, then, is no \"substantial\" u nity,' it ha s n o \"real properties,\" it gnotvs no real parts, no real c hanges, and' no causa)i'ty; all t h ese u o r d s are here understood' in the sense proper to natural science.' The physical scientist can properly define things materialistically as \"really existing\" and can see things in t e rm s o f a n t e cedent events pushing consequent events along in mechanistic fashion. But can we as psycholo- gists define the natural scientist as a human being, who must therefore behave from with- in a phenomenal understanding of reality in s imilar terms> Husserl said that w e c o u l d not. Human beings are moved by intentions, by goals and aims which they strive to rea- lize in a peculiarly nonmechanistic fashion.

Consciousness is funda- mentally intentional; it seeks to know things beyond itself yet in patterned relation to the self. Phenomenology seeks to clarify how we become conscious o f these related events in experience.' In the phenomenological method, we are not studying that but th i s, our very existence as conscious, meaning-creating be- ings.

Es- sentially, this p e rceptual p h enomenon ac- counts for our seeing motion solely as th e temporal displacement of perceived objects in our visual field, even when no actual ex- t ernal movement is t a k in g p l a ce.

Gestalt psychology takes root in p erceptual s tudy, though its f o u n ders were t o e x t e nd t heir descriptions t o h i g h e r m e n t a l p r o - cesses, personality, and even social organiza- tions.\" An d i n d o i n g s o , t h e y s p ecifically advocated the use of phenomenology, which they defined as follows: \"For u s p h enome- nology means as naive and full a description o f direct e xperience as p o ssible.\" \" T h i s emphasis on naive (simple, unsophisticated ) description is a t y p i c a l p h e n o menological c aution, that we as scientists not allow o u r assumptions regarding what is \"good\" science or \"factual\" description to get in the way of t he human e x p erience w e a r e trying to understand. For example, science teaches us that some things are sensations and other th i ngs are realities. A cloud may appear threatening to us as it approaches from across the sky, but this threat is not really being seen. The cloud i s just a collection of l i q ui d m a t e rial p a r - ticles.

T he y c a n only perceive (see, understand ) what th ey perceive, and hence the natural environment i s experienced in quite other terms than i t appears to a modern person. Indeed, Kohler once suggested that modern people cannot he completely naive about their phenomenal understanding of life, so biased have their perceptions become, thanks to the in Huence of natural science.\" The primitive belief in spiritual forces, such as m ana. (see Jung, Chapter 3 ), can thus be taken as a directly perceived phenomenal experience. Making an analogy to p h y sical science, the gestaltists spoke of a field of v i s i o n, organized into a molar totality (unitary mass ) a nd acting as a g e s talt. T h o ug h i t i s a constantly changing field, the relative prop- e rties within t h e fi e l d o f v i s i o n r e m a i n somehow constant and obey certain /atas o f organization. T he suhparts of t he t o t al a r e articulated th at — is, divided into distinctively recognizable suborganizations — but the over- all eRect of the molar totality cannot be pre- dicted from a st udy o f t h e s e p arate parts. The whole is something uniquely diRerent from or greater than the sum of its parts. We might say the whole transcends reduction to the parts. Over a period of years the gestalt- ists named a s e ries of l a w s t h a t d e s c r i be how this phenomenal field is organized, as follows: Law of unit formation and segregation. Uni- f orm st i m ulation p r o d u ces a c o h e s i v e (united ) field, whereas inequality in level of stimulation produces articulation (divi- sion ) in the field.\" A c i r cle or ring would be an example of the very cohesive field, unbroken by articulated inner parts. If we n ow begin d r a w in g l i n e s t h r o u g h t h e circle, making it i nt o a c a r t w heel design, we are increasing the complexity of articu- l ation.

A blob, with its disbalanced, uneven edges, is dif- ficult to p i c t u r e o r d e s c r ibe a ccurately, whereas a nicely proportioned outline like a teardrop shape is quickly recognized and readily recalled.

Items in the perceptual field that are equal or s i m i l ar in nature will be grouped together, as will items that are simply placed close to one a nother.\" In v i e w in g t h i s s e ries of d o t s we are prone to see three groups of three dots, rather than nine dots in a row. So long as each articulated subpart of three dots is fairly close to the others, we tend to relate the total as a gestalt, because after all, they are all equally dots. How- ever, if we extend the distance between the subparts, we would ev entually see three diRerent totals rather than three subparts of one total. These laws of organization are not mutu- ally exclusive categories of description. They c an interact as, for example, when a g o o d c ontinuation either might combine w it h o r m ight counter closure in o r der t o b r i n g a melody to a close or keep it going for several m ore notes. In the final analysis, all of t h e laws are referring to th e same gestalt phe- nomenon. The gestaltists formalized this com- monality by saying that a law o f pragnans' subsumed or was the most general phrasing of all the other laws of or ganization. Prag- nanz holds that \"psychological organization will always be as 'good' as the prevailing conditions allow.\"\" B y g o od , th e gestaltists meant regular, symmetrical, simplified, and perfect articulation of w hat t he y c alled the f igure — that is, the content on w h ich w e f i x attention when we perceive anything (what w e see, hear, smell, t o u ch, an d s o o n ). Furthermore, it is possible to speak of such figures only if we a lso consider the ground on which they rest. A closed circle, for ex- ample, closes a cohesive figure set against a background of cohesiveness, as when we draw a circle on a b l a ckboard. The b l ack- board acts as the ground for the circle. The contour of the circle is defined inwardly, so that the only wa y w e s e e an y fig u r e — the circle or a f r i end — is as a figure fr amed-in by a ground. We can thus name another all- embracing lau' o f figure against ground for- - mclrion: \". . . if two areas jof the perceptual field] are so segregated that one encloses the o ther, the enclosing one w i l l b e c om e t h e g round, the enclosed the fi g u r e .\" \" W h e n we now add that this figure will t end to be as simple, well articulated, and cohesive as possible, we have rephrased the law of prag- nanz in figure-ground terms.

Isomor- phism claimed an ia'entity in pattern for the phenomena ( thought) an d t h e n o u m e n a (the swirling atoms and molecules in matter ). In this sense, gestalt psychology takes on a n ativistic tone.

Feelings of pleasure and pain, wishes, desires, ulated subparts of the ego organization. The ego, in turn, was vi ewed as in a r t i c ulated relations with and a subpart of other divisions of the field, such as the family, neighborhood, social class, and so on.

For example, if we pass by a mailbox on our stroll t o o u r p l ace of work each m o r n ing, t ha t m a i l b o x i s n o t quite the same item in ou r l i f e s p ace each morning. On the morning when we have no letter to drop, it is merely a potential obstacle in our path like any other object — a tree, a p ost, or whatever. But o n t h o s e m o r n i n gs when we have a letter to mail — and especially when it is an important letter — the mailbox takes on q u it e a d i f f e r en t F i g u ral s t a tus. Rather than being something to be stepped around, the box literally beckons us to use it (acquiring great positive valence ). Phe- nomenologically speaking, it t akes on wh at Lewin called a demand character, so that it w ould be as correct to say t h a t t h e \" b o x brought us to it\" as it w o uld be to say \"w e went to the box.\" We usually say the latter o nly because of our e gocentricity, but t h e field forces of our life space play no favorites. The stresses and strains of disbalance when one aspect of the field beckons rriust be thought of as acting in a molar fashion \"all at once\" to re-establish harmony (pragnanz ) . The p erson is merely one fi g u r e among other figures set against an environmental ground. Lewin hoped that one day a mathematical system could be adapted to measure the molar activities of the life space. He thought that the nonquantitative form of geometry known as topological geometry would have the best chances to handle the structural and p o si- tional factors in the life space. Actions in the life space were not always identical to those o rthodox gestaltists did. He an d h i s m a n y students worked out a number of alternative concepts, some of which directly overlapped the traditional gestalt theory, though others did not. One such concept was the level o f aspiration.\" Le win's field theory emphasized that human behavior is directed toward goals and that people set their ow n e x pectations for what t hey w i l l t a k e t o b e s u c c ess or failure in l i f e . F o r s o m e — even talented- students, a grade of C w i l l b e c o n s i dered successful attainment, whereas others will be a s crushed by this \"low\" grade as if it w e r e an F. The former have acquired the habit of s etting low l e v els of a s p iration fo r t h e m - selves, whereas the latter have come to pro- ject high levels of aspiration — at least in this one sphere of possible achievement. Lewin called th e c o u rse o f b e h a v i oral action carried out in the l ife space the path or pathu ay, When Juan makes his way from h ome to hi s j o b a s a l a t h e o p e r ator, h e follows a p a t h w a y f r o m o n e a r t i c u l a t ed region of his l i fe s pace (home) to another (job). Juan likes working on a lathe so this job goal has a positive valence, but he dis- likes having to go into the m ain office and speak with his head boss. The main office bears a negative valence for Juan when he m ust direct his path of behavior to i t a s a goal. As we n o ted i n C h a p ter 6 (p. 401), Neal Miller's researches on frustration and conflict were based on these Lewinian con- structs of goals, pathways, and valences, as well as barriers to the attainment of g oals. Of course, Lewin always kept th e v a l ence of a goal in the life space of the person who is essentially making the environment what i t is. The n egative meanings of th e m a i n office are in the final analysis due to Juan's psychological outlook.

There is a l i m i t t o t h e d i f - ferentiation of the l if e space. Lewin called this the cell, but rather than viewing it as a b uilding block of th e l i f e s pace in th e r e - ductive style of Wundt an d H e l m h o ltz, he considered the cell a cohesively stable organ- ization which requires no fu r ther subparts. At the upper reaches of organization, we can begin speaking of the social group enter- i ng the o r g a n ization o f o u r l i f e s p a c e . Actually, during the last decade of his life, Lewin was moving away f ro m p e r sonality theorizing toward the role of social theorist. He probably did more for the establishment and development of social psychology than any other theorist in the history of psychology. In 1939 he coined the phrase group dynamics, and in th e e a rly 1 940s he established the Research Center for Group Dyn amics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (later moved to the University of M i c higan following his death ). He and hi s s t u dents p erformed the fi r s t c o n t r o l le d s t u d i es of leadership, in which they contrasted demo- cratic, authoritarian (autocratic ), and lais- sez faire (indiRerent, weak ) types of group l eadership.\" Th e m o de l t h a t u n d e r w r o t e this new area of g r oup d y n a m ics featured the typical gestalt emphasis on totality, organ- ization of s o cial r o l es, an d t h e r e s u l t ant c hanneling of h o stile t ensions outward t o scapegoats, and so forth. Lewin also worked on propaganda and the role of prejudice in the control of human relations. Indeed, his life work always bore the stamp of relevancy and p ractical application. Yet h e w a s f o n d o f saying, \"There is nothing as practical as a good theory.\" \" Thanks to his open m in d an d p r a c tical approach, Lewin and his associates (Ronald L ippitt, L e l an d B r a d f o rd , a n d K e n n e t h Benne ) initiated th e i n t e rpersonal activity t hat has been called T - g r o up s (Training groups ) or sensitivity training or en c o unter groups.\" In 19 I6 the researchers from MIT were holding a summer workshop aimed at training leaders to become more capable in the battle against racial and re l igious prej- u dice.

A research staff observed and recorded these group discussions and then latex that evening discussed their findings with Lewin in a kin d o f s e c ond g r ou p ex change. Ap- parently some of the subject-participants also attended these evening reporting sessions, w hich were conducted on th e c a m pu s o f Teachers' College, New Britain, Connecticut. When the point of view being expressed by the research psychologist conflicted with that o f a subject-participant's memory of w h a t h ad taken place that day, a k in d o f s p o n - t aneous group dynamic took p l ace i n t h e often heated discussion that followed. Rather than discourage such commentary from his subjects and the debates that re- sulted, Lewin in typical spontaneous fashion pounced on the opportunity and literally be- gan a second study of g r o u p i n t e r actions b ased on the f eedback from e a r l ier i n t e r - actions. The d i s cussion i n t h e s e e v e ning sessions became increasingly personal, and a participant necessarily gained insights con- c erning his or her i m pact on others in t h e group.

Rogers 5 7 5 Chapter 9 Applied Phenomenology: The director of th e R o c hester Guidance Clinic that Carl Rogers came into contact with th e philosophy of treatment advocated by Rank- ian social work, and w e s h al l see definite parallels in the two outlooks. It is essential that we grasp Rank's con- victions regarding th e p u r p ose of p s y cho- t herapy. He never tired of saying that t h e therapy relationship is for the client and not the therapist. If a therapist insists on pressing a pet theory onto th e c l i e nt, g eneralizing from past clients to the human being now p resent, he or she can never cure w hat i s wrong in th e l i f e of th i s ne u r o tic. Rather, says Rank, \"In e ach separate case it i s necessary to create, as it were, a theory and technique made fo r t h e o c c asion w i t h o ut trying to carry over this individual solution to the next case.\"\" T h e e R ective therapist always knows the clients individualized out- l ook on life and is able to discuss it in t h e client's omn language.\" Technical jargon is to be shunned. It is the spontaneity and the uniqueness of th e t h e r apeutic relationship which is the precious aspect of therapy — and that which cures — rather than the fanciful, high-blown theories of the therapist. The central problem facing the neurotic is the problem of every one of us as we grow to maturity. We m u s t l e arn t o e x p r ess our personal will and thereby take command of o ur own l i fe. I f w e f a i l t o a t t a i n t h i s i n - dependence from mother and father, we will go through lif e d e f e ated an d m i s e r able, hating those who repress us and hating our- s elves for not w i l l in g p o sitively. By g i v i n g up, the neurotic expresses a negative form of w ill, opting essentially for a flight f ro m r e - sponsibility. After e xperiencing feelings of complete defeat, the neurotic person enters therapy and sees the therapist as a symbol of all that is positive in the sphere of willful behavior. This i d ealization occurs because the neurotic projects his or her positive will o nto the t h erapist. Rank b e l i eved t hi s i s what Freud meant by transference. But there is ambivalence in this transference, because the neurotic would l ik e t o b e c ome a p o si- tively willing person like the t h erapist and t herefore resents the therapist to a n e x t e n t . B eing fundamentally afraid t o w i l l p o s i - tively, the client puts this eRort oR and submits dependently to the therapist's mill. One can see glirnmerings of a client's more positive will when he or she stands up to th e t h er- a pist and argues against this or t h a t i n t e r - pretation made in the course of the analysis. Freud incorrectly referred to t h i s a s r e sis- tance,\" considering it frustration of t h erapy, F or Rank, so-called resistance is th e v e r y heart of success ful therapy, for it signals the fact that the client — long subjugated by the wills of others (parents, peers, teachers, and so on ) — has finally begun to express his or her own positive will. Of course, the time it takes for a client to come to this stage of independence (\"resis- tance\" ) in therapy varies. If therapists assume that clients are slaves to their past, unable to shake oR the mistakes of their childhood, so that much time is devoted to searching about for these long-forgotten fixations, then clients may never gain the maturity to do their own thinking in psychotherapy. Even worse, the client's occasional \"resistances\" are likely to be crushed as childish re-enactments by the a uthority of th e t h e r apist.

However, as a theoretical development,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"PaIt rII 576 Ka n t ian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook R ank viewed the t e r m i nation as th e h i g h point and most crucial phase of therapy. He drew direct p arallels between th e a n x i ety generated iri the client at this point and the separation anxiety the c h i ld e x p eriences in being born (birth trauma ), in leaving mother t o attend school as a child, i n l e a v ing t h e f amily to t ak e u p a n i n d e p e ndent l if e i n young adulthood, and so forth. . These are the clear acts of commitment to life we all must make. In growing to adult- hood by degrees and t hu s e xpanding our consciousness, we all take on th e r e sponsi- b ility of s e l f - d i rection, w h ic h m e a n s w e e xercise our positive w i l l f u n c t i on . R a n k found his clients reliving all of these separa- tion situations during the end stages of ther- apy. In their dreams he saw birth symbols and came to view therapy termination as a form of rebirth — paralleling the religious acts of baptism which h ave fo r c e n t u ries been characterized as being \"born again.\" As such, particularly since the client plays a major role in directing this rebirth, Rank considered it a creative a ct. In the R a nkian w o r ld v i e w , each person constantly creates his or her own reality. Here is a de fi n it e ti e t o p h e n ome- nology and existentialism. Just as a person m ust. perceive t h i ng s p h e n oinenally a n d n ever know them d i r ectly, so too m ust h e or she believe in some things that are illusory — points of 'view that are more or less socially acceptable opinions. Hence, said Rank, \"The individual often lives better with his concep- tion of things, than in the knowledge of the actual fa'ct, perhaps is able to live only with h is own conception of th i ngs.\" \" S i n c e l i f e is fraught with o p i n i ons, what better than to live by our ou n opinions> It is therefore not important that we as therapists discover the real facts o f h o w t h e c l i e n t b e c am'e neurotic. It is of secondary concern that we h ave a unifying, single theory of th e n e u - rosis. What is important is th e decision on t he part of a n e u r o tic t o c r e ate hi s or h e r own cognitive-phenomenal world and to live w ithin i t w i t h w i l l f u l c o m m i t m en t f r o m day to day. When this commitment is made, the neurosis ends. There are other in fl u ences on R o g ers's thought that could be detailed, such as Lecky's (1945) self-consistency construct or Snygg and Combs's (1949) view o f t h e p h e n o m enal self.

The raw feeling would be phenomenally experienced, but its meaning or th e s i g nificance of it s p a t t ern would not.

T h us, i n a sense, Karen's bodily reactions are always in line with the proper attitude toward Lisa, but her consciousness or mental aw areness may be out of k i l ter w i t h w h a t i s a c t ually taking place. Hence, the feelings we h ave in relation to all aspects of life are very im- portant in defining what its various situations and circumstances mean t o u s (potential symbolization ). Indeed, the phenomenal field defines the person's subjective reality.\" \"Man lives es- sentially in his own personal and subjective world, and even his most objective function- ing, in science, mathematics, and the like, is the result of subjective purpose and subjec- t ive choice.\" \" B e h a v io r i s a l w a y s g o a l oriented, organized by the phenomenal field a nd carried out as a total gestalt.\" W h a t w e call objectivity in science is merely a special instance of intersub >ectivity, in that individ- uals called scientists have agreed to use a common terminology and means of observa- t ion which m a kes sense to each o f t h e m sub>ectively.

In his first book on the n ature of emotive, organ- ismic learnings i n p s y c h o therapy, Rogers sounded the note he would continue to ex- press over his long career: \"They are learn- ings with deep emotional concomitants, not learnings of intellectual content, and hence may or m ay not fin d c l e ar verbal expres- sion.\"\" W e c a n not a l w ays state the reasons f or our feelings.

Rogers would therefore say that the needs of the organism are n ot a l w a ys consonant with the needs o f the self \"T h e o .rganized subportion of the phenomenal field we know as the I or me may not have it as a goal to e nhance the organism by moving in th e d i - rections spontaneously felt (emotions ) to be the natural, correct ones. Darleen is with a g roup of popular n e ighborhood girls w i t h whom she would like to be identified, when t hey begin p o k in g f u n a t a n o t h e r g i r l , Martha. Martha is being painted as a drudge and a bore. Darleen does not really agree with this assessment, and she feels uncom- fortable making fun o f o t h ers in an y c ase. B ut she goes along wit h t h e r i d i c ul e a n d overlooks the fact that she feels terribly in- genuine and even guilty in playing the game of popularity. Her sel f needs to be popular have come into conflict with her organismic neeCs t o be t r ue t o h e r s e lf I f s h e . w e r e genuine in this instance (organismic need ), she would risk her opportunity to be known as one of the popular girls in her neighbor- hood (self need ). This takes us into what Rogers calls the valuing process. In defining his or h er s elf- concept, an individual di f f erentiates certain preferences articulated with i deals and feel- ings of commitment to certain ends.\" Of t en a value is sensed directly by way of \"sensory t ively or intuitively that \" t hi s I l i k e \" o r \" I have never really felt right doing that sort of thing.\" Many of our formal values as encom- passed in our self-concept are handed to us by our culture as reflected in th e a t t i t udes of our parents. We are taught what is right and what is wrong in behavior. We come to value certain religious and p o l i t i cal v i ews. The trouble is, sometimes what w e s e n se viscerally (deep, in our i n t e r nal o r gans or guts ) does not coincide with w h a t w e t e l l ourselves consciously. When this happens, we witness a confrontation of the n eeds of the organism with those of the self. Faced with personal inconsistency, we are forced to ask ourselves, \"What do I r e ally believe in any- how ~\" The reason we i n v ariably ask o u r selves this question is that, along with a n eed for o rganismic enhancement and g r o w th , t h e individual has a need to be s e l f consistent. - \"The only channels by which needs may be satisfied are those which are consistent with t he organized concept of self .\" \" I n o t h e r words, in organizing the confi.guration of the self-concept, we do no t s i m pl y a c cept and articulate within it all of th e e v i dence avail- able to us. A person who considers himself or herself brave may have a fl eeting sense of fear in a dangerous situation vvhich he or she does not articulate and combine into a self- concept. This sincere organismic reaction is therefore ignored because it is not consistent with the self-concept being fu r t hered. Any such self-inconsistency is experienced as a threatby the i nd ividual.\" ' R ogers noted how w e l i k e t o t h i n k o f ourselves as a Finished product, complete and o r visceral reactions.\"\" W e k n o w i n s t i n c -"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 Applied Phenomenology: The Client-Centered Psychology of Carl R.

T o think of ourselves as a fluid process of con- tinuous change is upsetting, especially since these changes when they come on us often contradict what we have assumed our com- pleted identity to be. Yet Rogerian theory is saying precisely this: the self is never finished, it is a c o n stant pr ocess of change within spells of sameness. Hence, it is correct to say that both the o r g a n ism (biological being ) and the self (psychological being ) are pitched t oward actualization — that is, gr o w t h , en- largement, enrichment, and diversity.\" They may not always agree on the goal of impor- tance, but both sides to our being are agreed on the gestaltlike necessity to develop into a totality. One does not move in this enlarging direction without sensing ever-recurring pe- riods of. inconsistency in that totality. When this happens, new tensions develop and a sense of needing to b e w h o l e — self-consis- tent — once again is renewed. This is exactly comparable to the way i n w h i c h pr a g n anz operates, and so it is not w r on g t o suggest that this principle underwrites Rogers' funda- mental theory of motivation. see in his general mood that he is depressed and defeated, we begin to suspect that he has a picture of himself (self-concept ) which is a t variance with how h e i s a c t u a lly l i v i n g organismically. There is a lack of congruence between his emotional life (organism ) and his psychological outlook (self). Congruence is defined as follows: \".. . w h e n s e l f-experi- ences are accurately symbolized, and are in- cluded in the self-concept in this accurately symbolized f orm, then the state i s on e o f c ongruence of self and experience.\"\" A m o r e pers'onalized definition would be: \"The term 'congruent' is one I have used to describe the way I would like to be. By this I mean that w hatever feeling or a t t i t ud e I a m e x p e r i - encing would be matched by my a w areness of that attitude.\"\" To be incongruent i s thus to b e o ut o f k ilter with w ha t on e t r ul y i s a s a h u m a n being. This condition can come about entirely a ccidentally, as in th e case of g r o w in g u p with parental values which one never truly commits himself or herself to; one just goes along because it is expected. Or one mi g ht actually bring on this state personally by re- fusing to be open to experience, by playing a role with others, by never being sincere with oneself, and so on. There is a range of con- gruence-to-incongruence, s o that th e e x t e n t of inner t ension (psychoIogical maladj ust- ment ) can vary. In i ts m o re e x t r e me form the state of incongruence can be quite harm- ful; \"This state is one of tension and internal confusion, since in some respects the indi- v idual's behavior will b e r e g u l a ted by t h e [organis mic] a ctualizing tendency, and i n o ther respects by th e s e l f-actualizing t e n - dency, thus producing discordant or in com- prehensible behaviors.\"\" Thus, in a r ea l s ense, the d i r ectionality taken by the self-concept strains against the spontaneous organismic actualizing tendency. Congruence versus Incongruence and Positive Regard It is freedom from inner tension that indexes the extent of psychological adjustment a per- son has achieved.

It would be best for him to admit to these sincere feelings, and moti- vated by their negative prompts, set a course in his l i f e t h a t c o u l d r e a l i stically correct things. If he actually would do this, then we would all notice a change in his persona/ity, a change Rogers would call a grou th because now, rather than working at cross-purposes, his total phenomenal being (his personality gestalt ) would be congruent. It w o ul d s t i l l have problems to work out in relation to the world, of course, but it would be underway again. What has changed in cases like this is the inner alignment. A fixed structure has not been altered. Rather, a process has once again begun to flow f o r w ard t o accomplish goals, including difficult ones. In his studies of what it takes to be con- gruent, Rogers hit on the factor of po sitive regard in human relations. This is defined as follows: \" If the perception by me o f s o m e self-experience in another makes a positive difference in my ex periential field [that is, phenomenal field ], then I am e x p eriencing positive regard for that individual. In general, positive regard is defined as including such at- titudes as warmth, liking, respect, sympathy, a cceptance.\"\" Dr aw ing on the work of o n e of his students,\" Rogers was to add to his en- hancement principles and the need for self- consistency, a \"need f' or positive regard\" which each person is said to possess.\" We cannot have a feeling of self-regard — a sense of personal acceptance — unless we feel posi- tively toward our entire organism and accept it for u hat it i s , r a t h er t h an m e r e ly w h a t someone has told us it is. Before we can sense c ongruence we m u s t fi r s t sense \"I am worthy\" or \"I can be what I feel myself to be without shame or apology.\" At heart, S t an- ley's incongruence is due to the fact that he has not come to accept himself as a unique person. His pretended optimism is therefore a defensive act, done to appease others and earn their positive regard. As in th e case of m ost defenses, the brittle a d j ustment th ey permit for a time tends to break down. Defensiveness versus Spontaneity D efensiveness is brought on b y a g r o w i n g sense of anxiety, which in turn ind icates that there is a disparity between the concept of s elf and th e t o t a l organismic experience pressing through to awareness \"An .attitude at variance with the symbolized belief system i s differentiated as a figure from out o f t h e ground of the phenomenal field. In order to maintain the picture of self a s symbolized, the individual now begins several maneuvers which are comparable to the classical defense mechanisms. Thus, Rogers is likely to speak of introj ection w hen he is r e f e rring to t h e f act that w e t a k e i n v a l u e s f r o m o t h e r s , usually our parents, and thus make it appear that these are our personal values when in fact they may or may not be.\" H e a lso used repression but gave this defense or adjust- ment mechanism a uniquely Rogerian inter- pretation. \" . .. it would appear that there is the organic experience, but there is no sym- b olization of this experience, or only a d i s- torted symbolization, because an adequate c onscious representation of it w o u l d b e e n - tirely inconsistent with the concept of self.\"\" This notion of a distorted symbo/ization 'is central enough to be considered a Rogerian mechanism of defense. It is closely related to what Rogers sometimes called de nia/, and in Human Behavior"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Chapter 9 Applied Phenomenology: The Client-Centered Psychology of Carl R. Rogers 5\"1 both of these concepts rely somewhat on the phenomenon of subception (see p. 5M). A good summary definition is, \"When an ex- perience is dimly perceived (or 'subceived' is perhaps the better term ) as being incongru- ent with the self-structure, the organism ap- pears to react with a distortion of the mean- ing of the experience (making it consistent with the self ), or with a denial of the exis- tence of the experience, in order to preserve t he self-structure fro m t h r e a t.\" \" F o r e x - ample, if Cora, a college sophomore, thinks of herself as a poor scholar but earns an un- expected A on an examination, she can retain her low level of positive self-regard by dis- torting the symbolized conceptualizations of this success experience and saying, \"The pro- fessor is a fool\" or \"It was pure luck.\" Rogers would occasionally refer to such distortions as rationalizations.\" The final Rogerian mechanism that can be used defensively deals with /ocus o f evalua- te'on. Each person acquires values in life; the locus of this valuation bears directly on the r esponsibility an individual will t ake for h i s o r her behavior. What i s t h e s o u rce of a person's values > Rogers observed: \" . .. an internal locus of evaluation, within the indi- vidual himself, means that he is the center of the valuing process, the evidence being sup- plied by his own senses. When the locus of evaluation resides in others, their judgment as to the value of an object or experience be- c omes the criterion of v a lu e fo r t h e i n d i - vidual.\"\" A \" m a m a's boy\" who never man- ages to untangle himself from mother's apron strings would be putting his locus of evalua- t ion into her i d e ntity. H e w o u l d t h i n k a s mother thinks and value what mother values. Though it would be difficult to see how or- ganismic enhancement or self-enhancement m ight be achieved in this flight f ro m i n d e - p endence, the young man w o ul d a t t a i n a s hort-term advantage by shifting hi s l o c u s of evaluation from his self to his mother. She w ould be deciding things for h i m , f r e e i ng him from the responsibility of making choices in life. To that extent, this maneuver would represent a type of defense. Running through Rogerian theory on the matter of defensiveness is an opposition be- tween the status quo and spontaneity. Indi- viduals caught up in d e f ensiveness are not truly free to be spontaneous. They live by distorted preconceptions of themselves. A pre- a dolescent boy may subceive \"I w o ul d l i k e t o 'punch' my y o u n ger b r o t her\" bu t d e n y t his potential symbolization f r o m a w a r e - ness — that is, fail to diRerentiate and articu- late as a figure on the ground of th e self- b ecause he already thinks of h i m s elf a s a good boy. He is therefore too rigidly fixed to accept the new understanding of what he is truly like. This distorted symbolization need not involve only negative behaviors like strik- ing others. It would be j ust as possible for this boy to subceive the warmly emotional feeling of \"I w an t t o t el l b aby b r o ther that I love him\" and yet fail to do so because of h is self-concept as a \"tough l i t tl e bo y w h o does not act sissified.\" The repression of a positive experiential prompting p r oves, said Rogers, that it is no t o nl y e v i l p r o m p t i n gs that are denied to aw areness.\" I n d eed, the relative goodness or badness of an e x peri- ential prompting is irrelevant. It is the con- sistency or i n c onsistency of a n e x p e r i e nce with the self-concept that determines whether it will be m ade conscious (symbolized ) or not (denied or distorted symbolization ).

He considered these to be secondary factors in the u n der- standing of personality, because no matter what inborn structures may be present they all serve the master motive of organismic en- hancement in any case. Out of a general tendency for organismic enhancement and a c tualization, the child gradually diRerentiates a self-concept. Self- identity is grasped along with a personal lo- cus of evaluation in th e i n t e rpersonal rela- tions carried on wit h p a r ents, siblings, and o ther people. Precisely what th e n a t ure of this interpersonal style will be — whether shy and uncertain or bold and o u t g oing — is up to the child's unique subceptions and per- ceptions in the articulation and d i B erentia- tions being organized into th e t o tal gestalt of the phenomenal field. Each life is subjec- tively unique. In Rogerian terms, the person ality w ould i n c lude th is u n i q ue t o t a lity o f the phenomenal field — self-concept, style of relations with others, important goals di8er- entiated as figures toward which behavior is oriented, and so on.

Just as we can f rame a hostile environment when people pick us up from the crib, so too can we look at our selves negatively.

He is unable to change his perspective on what is or is not a successful \"son,\" probably be- cause he was never given the chance by his o wn father to be h i m self an d d o h i s o w n thinking and e v aluating. Rogers once d e- scribed the correct approach for a parent to take who has an oRspring mi sbehaving in some way and who therefore needs talking so the boy makes every effort to do so with o nly bad results for he i s simply not well c oordinated. Derek's excellent talent a s a scholar does not bring m uch sincere praise from father, however. As a result, we see the development of a boy who foolishly devalues himself for not b e ing w h a t h e r e a lly d o es not want to be in any case. Too often, Rogers noted, adults make their positive regard for the child conditional — that is, depending on whether the child will first do something or achieve something the adults want accom- plished or conformed to. They are unable to provide the young person with unconditional positive regard, which requires an acceptance of the individual exactly as he or she is. Language enters here as well. As he moves from infancy to early childhood, Derek must symbolize (name, develop a system of ideas about ) his experience. In line with our d i s- cussion of th e d e f ense mechanisms, he is likely to symbolize only t h ose v alued be- haviors and attitudes his parents and other adults consider valuable. He will necessarily think of himself as a failure in l if e because he cannot fulfill his father's phenomenal-field expectations, even though if he had been left to his own spontaneous phenomenal diReren- t iations and ar t i culations, he w o ul d h a v e found positive self-regard in his good school work. This incongruent state of affairs, in which the v a luation p r ocess has been re- p ressed organismically in favor of a n i n a c - curate self-estimation, is called distorted sym- b olization. Instead of symbolizing what h e really is, Derek has distorted the self-concept which he now carries through life and which ensures his low self-regard. Rogers is a great believer in th e superi- ority of l e a r ning b y a c t u a lly e x periencing things, rather than by simply being told or taught them. A parent who expresses his or her own views of things yet allows the child leeway to test out a position at variance with t he parental view w ill — in the long r u n - to: 1 can understand hoar satis fying it feels to you to hit your baby brother (or to defecate arhen and urhere you p/ease, or to a'estroy things ) and 1 /ove you and am quite ari//ing for you to have those fee/ings But 1 a.m quite ui//ing for me to have my feelings, too, and 1 feel very distressed when your brother is hurt (or annoyed or sad at other behaviors ), and so I do not /et you hit hi m .

On the other side of the coin, once Derek really understands what"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Part III 594 Kan tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook his father's feelings mean in t h eir r e l ation- s hip, a new p e r ception of a t h l e tics m i g h t arise on his part. Derek enjoys pleasing his father, and it is possible that he has overesti- mated what his father expects of him. Possi- bly he could be less than a star in one of his favorite sports and still earn dad's respect.\"' Note that when Derek came to this point, he would be taking over the locus of evaluation. No longer would he routinely be doing what h e thinks dad insists that he do. He w o u l d now be working through an alternative more pleasing to himself and yet acceptable to his father. Rogers believed that this type of sin- cere, open, interpersonal exchange encourages the taking of responsibility on both sides and thereby furthers the growth-as-enhancement that human development always is. Rogers, who felt that such formulations are unnecessary until and unless clear phenom- ena call for explanation. One therefore looks in vain for a series of technical theorotypes in R o g erian p sychol- ogy. At the same time, however, generalized commentaries on certain types of adjustment, and even descriptions of definite personality traits, can be found in Rogers's writings. With full appreciation for his theoretical position, w e will now review a handful of t h e m o r e i nformal constructs used by R o gers to a c - count for individual differences. Dependent versus Independent. A clear t heme in Rogerian wr i t ing d e als w it h t h e matter of whether or not the person takes on an independent or a dependent pattern of be- havior. We can see decided Rankian influ- e nces emerging here. Speaking about t h e most difficult client to deal with th rough his therapy approach, Rogers noted: The attitudes tvhich most frequently seem to be ine fjectively handled are those tvhich might be c a l led \" a g g ressive dependence.\" The client tvho is certain that he is incapable of ma(ing his o tvn decisions or managing himself, and uho i n sists that th e counselor must ta (e over, is a type of client arith whom tve are sometimes success f ul, but not i n fre quently unsuccess ful.\"' When he discussed the kind o f c l i en t b e st suited for his therapy, Rogers suggested that he or she should have achieved a reasonable level of independence.\"' It s eems clear that this dimension of personality held great sig- n ificance for Rogers, and it r e l a ted t o t h e question of locus of evaluation. A dependent person surely does not, and often cannot, as- sume responsibility for the lo cus of ev alua- tion that has been f r amed i n t e r n ally. D e - pendent people look outward for s t a n dards to introject uncritically. Individual-Differences Constructs Rogers is opposed in p r i n c i p le t o p i g e o n - holing people into personality classifications of any sort. He once said, \"The client is the only one who has the potentiality of knowing fully the dynamics of his perceptions and his behavior.\" \"' In a sense, Rogers permits each individual to w r it e hi s or he r ow n p e r son- ality theory in order to describe the unique nature of the person's pheriomenal field. To f orce our concepts on others is to d o v i o - lence to the fundamental Rogerian outlook on interpersonal relations. This is why non- d irective or c l i e nt-centered theory ha s a l - ways treated lightly the need for a fixed series of personality constructs. In his first book on individual therapy, Rogers avoided the ques- tion of a personality theory altogether, only to be criticized later because his views failed to proceed from a coherent formulation of t his sort.\"' T h i s i n t e r e sted an d a m u s e d"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"C hapter 9 Applied Phenomenology: The Client-Centered Psychology of Carl R. Rogers 5 9 5 Self Ide-al versus Self I n s o m e o f h i s r e - searches, Rogers used a concept of the ideal s elf or self-ideal, which he defined as \"t h e self-concept which the individual would most like to possess, upon which h e p l a ces the highest value for himself.\"\" ' T h e i d eal self is essentially a goal toward which the person would aspire if all things were equal in the s ense of opportunities being a v a ilable t o achieve the valued level of behavior. Unfor- tunately, people often have differentiated and articulated various barriers to the attainment of their ideal selves. Sometimes their ideals a re not really theirs, and they can in t i m e change this side of the ledger as well. But in the main, R o g ers assumed that people h ave a reasonable understanding of w h a t they would \"like to be like\" if all things were equal. Rogers and his students have made use of a sorting procedure adapted from Stephen- son's Q-technique (1953) to measure the ex- tent of relationship between perceived self (\"how I am\" ) and self-ideal (\"how I would like to be\" ) . The procedure followed is quite simple. Clients about to enter t h erapy sort several statements which may or may not de- scribe them accurately as individuals. Each statement is printed on a separate card, and it might read \"I f eel p l eased to meet other people\" or \"Rather m inor things tend t o upset me.\" There is no fi xed t ype of state- ment. The main point is that a client must sort these cards according to certain statis- tical assumptions (approximating a normal distribution ), usually on a seven-point scale f rom \"like me \" t o \" n o t l i k e m e . \" H a v i n g completed this sorting (taken as the con- scious self-concept ), the client re-sorts the same cards into a scale of \"most like an ideal person\" and \"least like an ideal person.\" The definition of what id e al me ans is of course made clear to the sorter (\"someone you think w ould be near perfect and like w hom y o u would want to be\" ). The two sortings can then be statistically intercorrelated and even factor analyzed. Rogers's studies usually em- ployed a simple correlational measure indi- cating to what extent a self-concept and an ideal-self concept were identical. The assump- tion is that the gr eater the positive correla- tional value, the more highly a person thinks o f himself o r h e r s elf. C l i e nt s h av e b e e n shown to acquire higher correlations follow- ing psychotherapy than b e f or e t h e r apy.\"' Rogers therefore used this scale as a measure of therapeutic improvement. Vulnerability. \" Vulnerability i s the term used to refer to the state of incongruence be- tween self and experience, when it is desired to emphasize the potentialities of this state for creating p sychological di sorganization. When incongruence exists, and the individual is unaware of it, then he is potentially vul- nerable to anxiety, threat, and di sorganiza- tion.\" \"' Hence, just as we can draw distinc- t ions between people on th e b a sis of h o w similar they are to t h ei r s e lf-ideals, so too can we speak of differences among people in degree of vulnerability to maladjustment. Mature Behavior It i s a l so po.ssible to think of individuals as more or less mature in their behavior.

How- ever, since Rogers did name the ideal person as a worthwhile goal for humanity, we could do no better than end our consideration of his individual-differences concepts by citing his definition. \"It should be evident that the term 'fully functioning person' is synonymous with optimal psychological adjustment, op- timal psychological maturity, complete con- gruence, complete openness to experience, complete extensionahty, as these terms have been defined... .

However, if a person's self- concept is incongruent with th e o r g anismic valuing process, so that he or she holds to a s elf-concept that is not t r u l y r e fl ecting t h e underlying organic feelings, then we find in- creasing tension developing in the personality structure. Lorie feels surprisingly unenthu- siastic and confused about herself. Her mood should be one of excitement and satisfaction because she leaves for the big city next week to take up her new job. She has always said she wanted to go off to the city like her older s ister. This is her c h ance to d o s o .

Since be- h avior is always current, we ca n fi n d o u t what it means by taking the proper attitude of openness and genuineness. But what usually happens is that a person like Lorie who be- lieves that her self will be actualized in th e big city and wh o s enses thereby incongru- e nce between her self-aspirations and h e r spontaneous feelings about these aspirations, begins to develop an overlay of threat.

When the un- derlying incongruence approaches awareness — is close to being a perception — the person moves from threat to outright anxiety. Anx iety is a heightened state of fear with an em- p hasis on anticipation of d i saster. Lorie i s sensing threat in the present, but on the day when she is scheduled to leave home, feel- ings of anxiety will pass like waves through her body. This anxiety, however, is likely t o p a ss, and in time Lorie will w or k ou t her adjust- ment problems, either coming to like the city after all or, more probably, returning home to build a life in the smaller community. In the case of a more serious maladjustment, the person will not examine the underlying rea- sons for feelings of threat or anxiety. Instead, defenses will be tightened and symbolization will be distorted even more. The young man who subceives a h o mosexual im p ulse be- c omes touchy about j o kes i m p l ying h e i s sexually interested in his male friends or re- acts with disgust at the effeminacy of cer- tain men, and so forth. As long as a defensive separation of emotion from conscious intellect can be sustained, the young man will go on f unctioning reasonably well. However, it i s likely that in time so much insincere decep- tion will t ak e p l ace that pr ofound psycho- logical maladjustment will develop. It is when the person begins to sense (sub- ceive ) that he or she cannot resolve the grow- ing tension o f incongruence, so that neither self nor o r ganismic actualization is t a k i n g place, that help is sought in the form of psy- chotherapy.\"' The extent of b ehavioral dis- organization (symptoms ) varies, but one thing all neurotic people have in common is this sense of ineptness or low positive self- r egard. With each passing day they find i t more difficult to understand what is taking p lace in their l i v es. It i s a l m ost a s i f o n e were living with a stranger but in t hi s case the stranger is oneself. Put another way, the individual has lost c o m m u n ication within his or her personality system, and this break- down affects interpersonal relations as well. As Rogers summed it up, \"The emotionally m aladjusted person, the 'neurotic,' is in di f - f iculty first because communication wi t h i n himself has broken down, an d s econd be- cause, as a result of this, his communication with others has been damaged.\" \"' I n t e rnal incongruence always breeds external incon- gruence. The Irrelez'ancy o f Diagnostic Distinctions In the same way that Rogerian theory dis- misses categorizing people into p r eselected, hence arbitrary and unnatural, designations of pet sonality, so too does it argue that diag- nosis is unnecessary.

Al l m y l i f e I h a v e wanted to be an engineer, just like dad.\" The question is: are these consciously accepted engineering goals congruent with the organ- ismic valuing process (feelings), or are they introjected and distorted values pressed onto the self-concept by others> Randy is merely aware of a symptom: he cannot concentrate, he cannot sleep, and so on. The thought that he s hould work a t c r o s s-purposes with w h a t he wants stymies him . A s R o g er s n o t e d, \" . .. the neurotic behavior is incomprehen- sible to the individual himself, since it is at variance with what he consciously 'wants' to d o, which is t o actualize a self no l o n g er c ongruent wit h e x p e r i ence.\" \"' A t other times, a neurosis may represent the defensive m aneuvers of th e i n d i v i d ual t o avoid be- c oming aware of h i s o r h e r l a c k o f s e l f - consistency. All of th e d e f ense mechanisms discussed above may enter here. When efforts to keep up incongruence in the personality lead to excessive distortions in r eality, then w e ca n b e gi n s p eaking o f a psychosis An exampl.e of a mild distortion of r eality might b e w h e n t h e i n d i v i d ua l r e - fuses to accept responsibility for a misadven- ture in life which was clearly his or her fault. The person senses this guilt organismically (via feelings ) but denies it, asserting that \" that was not due to anything I di d.\" If t h i s i nsincerity continues and e x t e nds i n t o a spects of life, r ather t ha n p r e serving t h e b rittle structure of the self, in t i m e a c o r n p iete split from r e a lity m i gh t r e s u lt. N o w the person says, \"Other people are always b laming me. Everyone seems to be ou t t o g et me, maybe to kill me \" (paranoid delu- sion ). Other forms of escapist fantasies can then intrude, so the t h o r oughly d i s j ointed p ersonality now t akes refuge in s om e p r e - posterous insight: \" They want t o capture and torture me because I'm really the rein- carnated Jesus.\" An individual who has slipped over th e brink of rationality to this extent might be gin hearing voices or seeing images as well (hallucinations ). Since the phenomenal field i s organized by all factors active from m o - ment to moment, it f o l l ow s t ha t p e rceptual distortions can become great if the f alsifica- t ion somehow holds things together. If w e i nwardly feel that t h i ngs are about t o e x - plode with terror, then \"seeing\" an evil fig- u re lurking about w i t h c l e a rl y h o s t ile i n - tentions helps us to account for our extreme anxiety.\"-' During t hi s entire course of de- t erioration, the i n d i v i dual s r e l ations w i t h others suRer. One cannot speak of n e u rosis and then psychosis without thereby speaking of interpersonal relationships. Rogers made quite clear that, to the extent one individual i n an i n t e rpersonal relationship i s i n c o n - gruent, the relationship suffers in that it en- courages incongruity in the other; it di storts the nature of the t ru e i n t erpersonal experi- ence, and it seriously handicaps any form of genuine communication e merging.'\" O n c e again, internal incongruence breeds external incongruence.

It is the client who must change, and the therapist must trust him or her to do so. In his earliest phrasing of what h e then c alled t h e therapist' s hy pothesis, Rogers wrote, \"Efjective counselzng consists of a definitely structured, permissi ve rela tionship uhich aLLows the client to gain an understanding o f himself to a degree which enables him to ta (e positive steps in the light of his new orientation.\"'\" T h e k e y w o rd i n this statement of therapist values is relation ship. Rogers made clear that the most essen- tial ingredient in therapy is the creation of a free and permissive relationship having the characteristics of w a r m th , a cceptance, and f reedom fro m c o e r cion.' \" C e r t a i n l i m i t a - tions had to be placed on the client, of course. The therapist could not be assaulted or office furniture broken. But all such restrictions in the structuring of t h e c l i e n t-therapist rela- t ionship were to b e k e p t t o a m i n i m u m . Rogers expanded this t h erapist hypothesis into what he called the cl ient centered hy- - pothesis, as follows: ... we may say that the counselor chooses to act consistently upon the hypothesis that the individual has a sufjzcient capacity to deal constructively uith al l t h o s e aspects o f his life u 'hich can potentz'aLLy come into ca n scious awareness. This means the creation of an interpersonal situation in which mate- rial may come i nt o t h e c l i e n t' s asvareness, and a meaning ful demonstration o f the coun selor's acceptance o f the client as a person who is competent to direct himsel f.'\" Over the years, since first expressing this client-centered hypothesis, Rogers moved gradually to espouse the therapist's growing openness in revealing himself or h e rself as a person. There was good r e ason fo r h i s c hange in approach, and we w an t n o w t o capture those reasons. In the earlier form u - lations, the relationship was pitched entirely in the direction of the client's identity. ... the relationship is experienced as a one- way affair in a very unique sense. The whole relationship is composed o f the self of the client, the counselor being d e p ersonalized for purposes o f therapy i nt o b e i n g \" t h e client's other sel f .\" Lt is this w a r m willing ness on the part o f the counselor to lay his own sel f temporarily aside, in order to enter into the e x perience o f the c l i e nt , w h i c h ma(es the relationship a completely unique one, unli (e anything in the client's previous experience.'\" Rogers was careful to emphasize that there should be no evaluation of the client by the therapist (to parallel his dislike for diagnosis in general ), no probing, no interpretation of what the client is supposed to be doing, and \"no personal reaction by the counselor The relationship is thus client-centered be- cause it is the client who needs to reopen an inner communication between o r g a nismic a nd self-evaluations of what i s w o r t h w h i l e a nd important in life and w hat i s n ot.

In time, the idea will occur to her, \"If this 'doctor' can accept me as I am, even with my o bvious shortcomings, why c a n' t I a c c e p t myself as myself >\" This attitude is often the first step toward change. As Rosa increasingly puts herself in touch with her o r g a n i smic v a l u es (reflected in feelings about the various things considered ) and rejects those values of the self that are d istorted and ingenuine, she wil l p r o m o t e congruence. She might think, \"Some of what I can't accept about myself is what m o ther always expected of me. She wants me to be l etter-perfect in m y s p eech and t o a l w a y s make a good impression.

In fact, Rogers was to take t hi s g eneral theory of change and raise it to a lan o f interpersonal relations which he felt had relevance to all human interactions, inside of therapy or out. Assuming a minimal mu t u al ui 1 l ingness to be in contact and' to receive communications, u e may say that the greater the commu- ni cated congruence of e x p e r ience, aware- ness, and behavior on the part o f one indi vidual, the more the ensuing relationship uill involve a tendency toward reciprocal com- munication ui th th e s a me q u a l i t ie s, m u t u - ally accurate understanding o f the communi cation', improved psychological adjustment and functioning in both parties, ana' mutual satis faction in the relationship.\"' This interpersonal prescription has occa- sionally been termed the he l p i ng r e l a tion ship,'\" and it is a lso a significant aspect of what is called the process equation of psy- chotherapy.'\" The basic idea is that one per- son in a r e l ationship — be it therapeutic or simply social — intends that there should come about in another person \"more appreciation of, more expression of, more functional use o f the latent i n ne r r e sources of th e i n d i - vidual.\" '\" T h e R o g e r i an w orld view h a s every person a therapist for every other per- son.

H owever, on t h e m o r e p r a c t i c a l p l a n e , Rogers discussed the issue of trans ference in t erms of client-centered counseling. He ad - mitted that transference phenomena seem to come up in client-centered therapy but at a much reduced level when compared to that o f psychoanalysis. As he p u t i t i n 1 9 5 1 : \"Thousands of clients have been dealt with by counselors with whom the writer has had personal contact.

If Dolores is being counseled by a Roger- ian therapist and somehow develops a trans- formed neurosis (see p. 98), Rogers would say that this has occurred because the ther- apist she was seeing mishandled the case. 1nright and Trans ference One of the clear implications of the client- centered approach as first conceived was that clients have to find t h eir ow n e x p l anations for why they suRer from psychological mal- adjustment.

The t h e rapist may h a v e unknowingly supported value statements is- s uing from th e s elf-concept, a body of a t - titudes and beliefs that are no t c o n g r uent with the spontaneous feelings that Dolores is having about her life. Rather than accept- ing feelings of love or hostility from Dolores for what they were — honest reactions in the here and now which could be explored to see what they mean — her therapist probably tried to relate these to past figures in her life, such as her father or mother.' ' Emotional displays toward a therapist are o ften just w h a t t h e y a r e . A s s u ming t h a t Dolores had a male therapist, his manner in the relationship may have been sexually at- t ractive or even seductive. By t a k in g t h e authority role, such a therapist could invite t hrough a d i s play o f p o w e r a l l k i n d s o f subservient and sexually flirtatious behaviors from a female client.

In 1941 he thought of counseling primarily in t e rms of a one-way emphasis on the client. This had changed by 1959 to the view that sometimes the therapist has to speak out personally in the relationship. This is especially called for when certain emotions are pressing onto the t herapist's subj ective awareness.\"' I n t h i s case, to ignore the feelings generated by the organismic valuing process would be to pro- mote interpersonal incongruence. The ther- a pist might be feeling something like \"Y o u sadden (surprise, shock, and so on ) me by your attitudes,\" but would not c o m m u n icate this to th e c l i e nt.

' Summing u p t h i s p r o cess, Rogers essentially defined psychotherapy as follows: \" Psychotherapy deals primarily with the or - ganization and functioning of the self. There are many elements of experience which the self cannot face, cannot clearly perceive, be- cause to face them or admit them would be i nconsistent wit h a n d t h r e a t e nin g t o t h e c urrent organization of the self.\" \" ' The therapist acts as a companion, as an acceptant alter ego who helps the client work his or her way through a dark forest of rnis- u nderstanding and confusion.'\" I n m a k i n g this passage, clients come to experience them- selves in new ways even as they reject the older ways of self-definition.'\" In a very real sense, psychotherapy is a \"learning of self.\" \"' Of course this learning will not take place if the proper relationship is not formed. From the outside, psychotherapy might be defined as the \"alteration of human behavior through interpersonal relationship.\" \"' It w a s w h e n he attempted to name the essential elements in this relationship that Rogers made it most clear that he put more trust in attitudes than formal theories. One cannot teach psycho- therapy in textbooks. Every research study he did convinced Rogers more that \"person- ality change is initiated by attitudes which exist in the therapist, rather than primarily by his knowledge, his theories, or his tech- n iques.\"\" T h e t r u e facilitator achieves ther- apeutic ends by a p proaching i n t erpersonal relations with the nondirective attitude that permits others to be themselves.\"' Figure 25 s c h ematizes the pr o c e ss o f change taking place in a client's self-concept (removed from the phenomenal fields of Figures 23 and 24 ) as he or she progresses t hrough nondirective therapy. Let us t h i n k of this in terms of a specific client: jesse is a young man who did not fi n ish high school, has had a poor work record, and is at present very undecided about what to do in l i fe. He has moved t h r o u g h v a r i o u s p e r s o n ality phases in the past, playing the l a d y's man and the tough guy, including a few scrapes w ith the p o l ice. H e h a s r e c e ntly l os t h i s driver's license through an arrest following a minor automobile accident in which he was discovered driving w h i l e i n t o x i c ated. H e enters nondirective therapy expecting to hear another series of lectures from authority. This d oes not happen, of c o u rse, and i n t i m e , thanks to the permissive therapeutic climate, J esse begins to talk more an d m o r e a b o ut himself. At point 1 of Figure 25 we see jesse's self-concept upon entering psychotherapy. It is a poor gestalt, with pieces that do not fit together well, as they are distortions of the r eal organismic valuations he wa s m a k i n g years ago. Jesse is not as tough or as sure of himself with the opposite sex as he has pre- tended to be i n t h e p a s t .

A c t u ally, R ogers and hi s c o l - leagues worked out a scale measuring seven stages o f movement in t h e r a peutic cure.'\" The specific points on this scale are not rele- v ant for our p u r poses, but we m i gh t n o t e the general scheme as an example of Rogers's theory of cure. The first stage is fixity and re- moteness of experience, like our client Jesse who is not even sensitive to his feelings. He is rigid and unbending at this point, unwill- ing to admit to personal problems of any sort. Here is where other people are blamed for his plight. Gradually, in stages two and three, jesse begins to become aware of himself as a feeling organism, sensing his evaluative re- actions in relation to l i f e s experiences. At stage four, Jesse's outlook on life is more re- laxed and objective, enabling him to become aware of the contradictions existing between his feelings and his everyday experience. He is amazed at t h e g r e a t e r u n d e r standing achieved by honestly letting his feelings point the way. As a result of the confidence stem- ming from the accuracy of his feelings, Jesse begins to t r ust h i s s p o n t aneous emotional sensations more and more. By the fifth stage, feelings of great importance are beginning to well up in Jesse's awareness, surprising him and teaching him a great deal about himself. He is fascinated by t hi s p r o cess of spon- taneous change and tries to understand the meanings of these feelings. Once he has an understanding of the feelings, he also has an idea of what must be done about them, what they are suggesting to him as a. course for Occasionally a feeling tone fails to make itself known clearly to Jesse. He has a \"kind of\" feeling about his high school pr incipal which is not clear as to its meaning. A work- ing-through of such partially known feelings is necessary at this point until, al ong about stage six, they break loose and Hood jesse's a wareness with insight. T hi s i s a b ou t t h e time when J esse begins putting t h i ngs t o - gether again, reorganizing hi s s e l f-concept in the process. He is now fully aware of the locus of his feelings and of th e e v aluations they imply. He no longer thinks of h i m self as an object to be moved about by others or by circumstances, but takes responsibility for s elf-direction. Subjectivity i s n o l o n g e r a threat, In the final or seventh stage, Jesse be- comes a fully functioning person. There are a half-dozen or so essential in- gredients that must be present if R o g erian therapy is actually to wor k l i k e t h i s . F i r s t, two people must be in contact, which means that there is communication between them. One of them, the client, must be incongruent though he or she may experience this incon- g ruence as anxiety and no t se e t h e a c t u al problem. The o t her p e r son, th e t h e r apist, must be congruent in t he re l ationship. Fur- ther, the therapist must be experiencing un conditional positive regard, which is defined as follows: \" . .. if th e s e l f-experiences of another are perceived by me in such a w ay that no self-experience can be discriminated as more or less worthy of p o s i t ive r egard than any other, then I am experiencing un- c onditional positive regard for t h e i n d i v i d - u al.\" \"' T h i s i s essentially the at t i tude of nonjudgmental acceptance Rogers always in- sisted upon in the therapist's behavior. An- other requirement is that the t h e r apist gen- uinely feel an empathic understanding of the c lient from th e l a t t er's f r am e of reference.

However, because of the extent of this literature, we will only consider selected aspects of his writings as examples o f what R o gers understood to b e m e n t a l health. In his earliest papers, as he was working out the essentials of a t h e r apeutic relation- ship, Rogers s tressed the necessity for t h e i ndividual t o b e m o r e o b j e c t iv e i n s e l f - p erceptions.\"' T hi s d o e s not mean seeing oneself as an object, something acted upon and manipulated without i n t e r nal c o ntrol. Rather, it i m p l ies a more willing, honest, and open acceptance of whatever our feelings indicate. Another characteristic of mentally healthy people is that t hey l ose th eir self'- consciousness as they develop greater self- awareness. We are self-conscious when we are out of t o uch w i t h o u r g e n u in e b e ing. Once we accept who we are, there is no rea- son to be concerned about ourselves in self- conscious fashion.\"' Neurotics are symptom- laden because they are continually on guard and sensitive to the reactions of others. Their symptoms are t h ei r d e f e nsive shields. A h ealthy person is no t c o n cerned wit h t h e r igid requirements that others hold out a s b ait or reward fo r w h a t t h e y w a n t d o n e . Healthy i n t e r personal r e l a tions a re no t achieved by such unyielding manipulations of one person by another. A healthy person is not entirely wi thout defenses, of course. Th r eats will naturally arise, and even the most self-enhanced indi- vidual will from t im e to t im e e x hibit a cer- tain defensiveness.\"' But the mentally healthy p erson is mor e a w a r e o f t h i s p r o t e c t i v e maneuver when it arises, and in m ost cases, will drop its use as soon as possible. If more o penness in life were the rule, it w o ul d b e easier for all of us to drop our defensiveness. As long as we recognize when we are being defensive, we have not slumped to the level of the first stage of the p r ocess of change, wherein the individual is unaware of feelings a ltogether. Hence, in d e fi n i n g m e n t a l o r psychological adjustment, Rogers was to say, \"Optimal p sychological a d j u s tment exists when the concept of self is such that all ex- periences are or may b e a s similated on a s ymbolic level into th e g e stalt of t h e s e l f - Awareness thus continues to be the central c oncept in Rogerian definitions o f m e n t a l health. Mentally healthy people are open to experience, trusting of their organism, accept- ing of their subjectivity as evaluators of their phenomenal experience, and willing to be a process of change.\"' T a k in g a p h r ase from the existential philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, Rogers said that to be fully functioning is \"to b e that self w h ic h o n e t r u l y i s . \" \" ' T h i s state necessitates dropping facades, moving away from rigid compunctions, meeting ex- perience as it is and not doing things simply to please others, accepting responsibility for s elf-direction, and m o v in g a l w a y s t o w a r d new aspects of life w i t h a n a c c e ptance of others and a trust in one's self.\"' T h e se are the essentials of what Rogers was finally to call existential livin g, a c o n c e pt t h a t c o m - bines his phenomenological approach and his emphasis on the changing processes of life. Existential l iving is t h u s t o l i v e w i t h \" a maximum of adaptability, a discovery of structure in experience, a flowing, changing structure."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"C hapter 9 Applied Phenomenology: The Client-Centered Psychology of Carl R.

An Evolutionary Theme and a ¹t u r a/ E t h i c Rogers had us evaluating our lives spontane- ously and, through considering our feelings in relation to various alternatives, opting in a direction that will i n e vitably promote the welfare of everyone. Yet, can we really trust our feelings like this> Rogers would seem to neecl additional theoretical j ustification for t his optimistic view o f p e o p le, w h o sup- posedly fall back on subjective feelings to opt unselfishly for the betterment of all. Inter- estingly, though it was not given prominent emphasis in his earlier writings, we can in- d eed find a theoretical justification for t h i s positive outcome of the organismic valuing process in Rogers's theorizing. This justifica- tion stemmed from an evolutionary view o f human nature, in w h i ch v a l u es are carried by the organic processes of life. We might even say that these processes are the essence o f life, the truest reflection of w hat w e a r e as human beings, because they are closest Hence, as in his wisdom-of-the-organic as- sumption discussed above (see p. 584), we find Rogers essentially contending that when we are mentally healthy, our tie to physical organic nature is closest. Congruity is a gen- u ine tie to n a t u ra/ p r o cesses, a tie t hat i s never made or shaped or controlled into ex- istence by cultural (made by people ) arti- facts. There is no way for human beings to manufacture congruity, because it can only arise naturally, as a process of being in touch w ith an d c o n s i stent w i t h o n e ' s o r g a n i c totality. This unity with perceived experience is what Rogers meant when he wrote in 1951, \"From an external point of view the impor- tant diRerence I following reorganization of the self ] is that the new self is much m o r e nearly congruent with the totality of experi- ence — that it is a pattern drawn from or per- c eived in experience, rather than a p a t t e r n i mposed upon experience.\" \"' T h e r e i s n o way in which to create a sense of congruence artificially. Congruence is the very opposite of artificiality. It is actually a movement back into nature as spontaneously experienced by an organic being. Rogers brought this point home as f o l l ows: \"Thus the therapeutic process is, in its totality, the achievement by the individual, in a f a v orable psychological climate, of further steps in a direction which has already been set by his growth and mat- urational development from the time of con- ception onward.\" \"' Client-centered therapy is thus not a form of human engineering nor a method of con- trolling nature to meet an arbitrary end. The only end acceptable to Rogers is that spon- taneous state of uncontrolled — literally natu- ral — living. In 1959 he stated, \" . .. psycho- therapy is the releasing of an already existing capacity in a potentially competent individ- ual, not the expert manipulation of a more or l ess passive personality.\" \"' W e n o w b e g i n to see what Rogers considered the human's capacity for self-enhancement. As congruence is fostered both intrapersonally and interper- sonally, the potentials for a b r o a d ened ex- perience are of necessity enhanced since peo- ple do not need to act defensivly, to turn oR sincere promptings. If nature prompts, why should we deny this prompting> Drawing on more than thirty years of experience as thera- p ist and consultant, Rogers in h i s m a t u r e statements began to see that a/i people move in the same general direction of e n h anced experience, provided that they ar e a l l o w ed to be free in their relationships. \" . ..

Rogers has seen clients in many different c ountries and engaged in t h e r apy o r e n - counter groups with therapists of quite dif- f ering personalities, all moving t o w ard t h e c ommon organismic values he outlined i n such detail. Putting this commonality in nat- ural terms, he observed, \"I like to think that this commonality of value directions is due to t he fact that w e a l l b e l o n g t o t h e s a m e species — that just as a human infant tends, i ndividually, to select a diet similar to t h a t selected by other human infants, so a client in therapy tends, individually, to choose value directions similar to t h ose chosen by other clients.\" \"' When people are free to choose, they choose alike, and the valued goals se- l ected are goals that make fo r t h ei r \" o w n survival, growth, and development, and for the survival and development of others.\"'\" This is to say that in any culture, at any time in history, the mature individual would opt for these very same values.\"' T h us, Rogers defended a universal natural ethic, rooted in the very fabric of organic life and transcend- ing cultures. He makes this plain in the fol- lowing excerpt: Instead o f universal values \"out th e re,\" or a universal value system imposed by some group philosophers, r— uLers, priests, or psy chologists u Ie have the possi— bility o f uni- versal human value directions emerging from the experiencing organism.

Yet the great stress placed on a therapist's approach (avoiding making decisions for clients, turning th e d i scussion lead over to the client at al l t i m es, and so on) seemed to impress some of Rogers's col- leagues as shrewd \"how to \" s t eps of c l i ent m anipulation.

Hence, he drew this parallel: \"To my mind the 'best' o f education mould pro duce a person very similar to the one pro duced by the 'best' o f therapy.\"'\" This would seem to make every teacher a therapist. Yet an e ve n m o r e f u n d a m ental truth is that every person is a therapist! Many o f Rogers's later papers are taken up w i t h discussions of how congruence can be pro- moted in various interpersonal settings. For example, parents must be congruent in their r elations with t h ei r c h i l d re n a n d a c q u i r e that sense of trust that will permit the child at a certain time i n l i f e t o b e a s e p a r a te p erson.\"' Every member of a f a m i l y m u s t be allowed the dignity o f s e p aration fr om time to time, with the freedom to have soli- tude and hi s o r h e r o w n p r e o c c upations. R ogers was not seeking a w o r l d o f h a n d - h olders with sm il ing f a ces wh o p l ac e t h e group above the individual. In fact, his view was that one cannot be creative unless he or she has the capacity to accept the feeling, \"I am alone.\"\"' T h e c r eative individual hopes t o communicate with others in t i me, but i n order to be capable of independent thought, he or she must retreat to a psychological if n ot literal corner in life f rom t i m e t o t i m e . Rogers proposed a few rules which might facilitate congruence in i n t e r p ersonal rela- tions. For example, what if a f a m il y d i scus- sion or a labor-management arbitration were to follow the rule, \"Each person can speak up for hi mself only af t er h e h a s f ir s t r e - Generalized PrincipLes for Interpersona/ Behavior T he interpersonal concern for t h e \"other\" should not be limited to therapy. Rogers ex- t ended his view o f t h e r e l a t i onship to a l l manner of i n t erpersonal and even i n s titu- tional situations. An eRective facilitator in the classroom sets an open climate, helps the class choose its goals, trusts the students to direct their own s elf-actualization, and be- comes a participant learner within the total process.\"' Rather than fi l l in g t h e h e ads of students with facts, as in th e m u g - and-jug view of l e arning, Rogers saw th e t e a cher working as a resource person for the student body. Effective teachers share t h emselves with their s t u dents, recognize and a ccept their own limitations, and encourage the ex- pression of emotions as well as i n t ellectual insights in the classroom.

T12e Basic Encounter Group As we have noted above, Rogers's approach is more personally revealing and open in the encounter group than it is in individual psy- c hotherapy. The basic ph i losophy of c o n - gruence and relationship remains the same, but encounter groups have demands of their own which require special techniques. There is really no adequate definition of an encounter group. Recall that the first such g roups were e s sentially p o st-mortems o n Lewinian researches (see p. 573). These evolved into an attempt to treat several indi- v iduals together in w h a t i s t a n t a m o unt t o group therapy. The number of c l ients in a contemporary encounter group can vary from t hree or four u p t o a s m a n y a s fi f t e e n o r twenty, but the usual size is from six to ten. Some group therapists have taken strictly Freudian views of illness and cure, and the level of interpretation in such approaches is virtually identical to interpretations in indi- vidual therapy. Other group therapists have relied more on gestalt psychology or Lewin- i an small-group theory to p r o v id e t h e r a - tionale for what goes on w he n p e ople get t ogether, motivated by a n i n t e r est i n s e l f - knowledge and greater facility for r e l ation- ships. Rogers found himself trying to m a x i - m ize everyone's freedom in th e g r o ups h e conducted. \"In an encounter group I l ove to give, both to the participants and to myself, the maximum freedom of expression.. .. I do trust t he group, and f i nd i t o f t e n w i s e r t han I i n i t s r e a c t i ons t o p a r t i c u lar s i t u a- Encounter groups are customar ily held at a somewhat removed hotel, motel, or resort area.

Though he devoted little space to the topic of resistance in his w r i t i n gs on i n d i v i d u a l therapy, Rogers did take up this phenomenon in regard to groups. \"Silence or muteness in the individual ar e a c ceptable to me pro- v iding I a m q u i t e c e r t ain i t i s n o t u n e x - p ressed pain or resistance.\"'\" I t w o u l d a p - pear that if a g r o u p f a c i l i t ator d o es sense resistance in a group member and then ex- presses this feeling to the member, he or she would essentially be i n t e rpreti n g o r p r o - viding insight of sorts to the client. Rogers would have no argument with t hi s sugges- tion. He would merely stress that the focus of his interpretative comments is always on the ongoing behavior o f g r o u p m e m b e r s, specifically as these behaviors impinge on his personal phenomenal field.

Rogers has used all of these group When a group begins to settle down to its task and people loosen up enough to say what they honestly feel, a number of problems may arise as cextain members find this frankness and openness unbearably threatening. The skills of the facilitator enter at this point to know exactly when an encounter is getting out of hand, and so on. Many psychologists oppose the encounter-group znovement be- cause of the harm such experiences can have on people, sometimes even with the most ex- perienced facilitators present.

Facilitators who manipulate the group, make rules for it, or covertly di- rect it toward preconceived ends are not rec- ommended. The hi strionic facilitator, who judges success by how m a n y p a r t i c i pants weep, is also to be avoided. Rigid facilitators, w ho have some one thing t o a c h i eve li k e \"drawing out th e b a sic rage in everyone,\" are not going to help a group become what it otherwise could. Rogers would not recom- mend facilitators who have such severe per- sonal problems that they constantly turn the center of attention on t h emselves. He also did not favor the type who doles out dynamic interpretations at every turn. Finally, Rogers did not advocate facilitators who w i t h h old themselves from personal emotional partici- p ation in th e g r oup — which would be t h e o ther side o f c o m p l etely d o m i n ating t h e , «roup with personal hang-ups.

Rogerian personality theory therefore be- gins on the assumption that each of us lives w ithin our ow n p h e n o m enal f i e ld , w h i c h combines unique mental and bodily experi- ences into an overall understanding of sub- jective reality. We have important physical reactions — feelings, moods, emotions — which d efine this reality and with w h i c h w e m a y or may not be in touch. When w e are cog- nitively aware of a feeling, Rogers would say we have symbolized it. Sometimes we can subceive a personalized emotion — a meaning- f ul indication of how we are fr a m ing a l i f e circumstance — even before we have given it symbolical form, or symbolization. The iden- t ity of t h e p e r son i n R o g e r ia n t h e or y i s Chapter 9 begins with a review of the gestalt- p henomenological school of t h o u g h t that Rogers was to base much of his theory on.

It is impossible i n principle for a n y one else to k n o w o u r selves the way u e know our selves, because to do so, the other person would have to be in our subjective reality. Hence, even so-called objective descriptions of behavior are in real- ity intersubjective accounts. The self-concept emerges from the phenomenal field as a fig- ure from the ground, and when we are not focused on our selves, it can lose articulation and become an undiRerentiated aspect of the ground. We can lose ourselves for a time as we focus on other figures of interest in our subjective phenomenal fields. T here is a single, master motive in l i f e which Rogers called o r g anismic enhance- ment. This is a desire on the part of all living organisms to extend the range of their phe- nomenal fields and to enrich them through further articulations and d i f f e r entiations- much as we enrich diamonds by cutting more facets into their t otality. A p r o b lem a r ises, however, in the f act t hat t hi s e n hancement takes two forms. There are needs of the or- ganism and needs of the self which must be satisfied. The former are essentially natural and personal, whereas the latter are taught to us by important figures in our lives — parents, t eachers, and the society i n g e n e r al. T h e person organizes his or her self-concept ac- cording to a valuing process which strives to be acceptable to others and internally (self-) consistent. Feelings that may be genuine and accurately reflect the organismic valuing pro- cess may be denied in f a vo r o f a s o c i etal value that implies that the person should not be experiencing such emotions. This results in threat, and the person may then d i stort the symbolization of the accurately perceived emotion. Ideally, there should be a matching up or congruence of the organismic (emo- tional, feeling ) and the self-concept (psycho- logical, social ) aspects of p h enomenal ex- p erience. However, a c e r t a i n a m o u n t o f incongruence is u s u ally e x p e rienced, and when this disbalance is excessive, we can even speak of psychological maladjustment. Unfortunately, human beings often lack positive regard for each other, so that when one person deviates from a traditional way of b ehaving, even though this i n j u res no o n e else, there is a certain amount of pressure to bring this deviant hack into line. Parents in p articular are likely to i g n or e a c h i l d' s i n - dividuality and press upon him or her values the child does not sincerely or organismically feel in tune with. A ccording to R o gers, re- pression occurs when such unacceptable feel- ings are not symbolized. Such denial can be rationalized away for a time, but eventually t he internal locus o f e v a l u ation s h i ft s t o what others think and feel rather than what the person thinks or feels. The person is now e ssentially victimized by others, who m o v e h im or he r a b ou t l i k e a n a u t o m a t on. I n order to mature properly and become what Rogers called a fully functioning person, the i ndividual must b r i n g b a c k t h e l o c u s o f evaluation to an internal frame of r eference, r elying o n o r g a n i s mi c e n h a n cement. I n achieving this internal congruence, the per- s on would eRectively become m or e i n d e - pendent in behavior. The mature person in Rogerian terms has achieved independence from parental pressures. Rogers's theory of illness stems from the incongruence construct and the distortion in s ymbolization it i n v a r iably results in . T h e person is vulnerable to attacks of a n x i ety, threat, and disorganization because he or she does not feel up to th e events that seem to throw life i nt o o n e c on flict a f t e r a n o t her.

Rogers 6 1 5 through diagnosing a symptom picture, but he did refer t o m o d e r ate incongruence as neurosis and extreme incongruence as psy- chosis. Rogers devoted considerable atten- tion to his theory of cure which was based on what he called nondirective or client-cen- tered therapy. The client-centered therapist assumes that a client can deal constructively with all those aspects of his or her life that can potentially come into conscious aware- ness. The climate of the th erapeutic contact is all-important here. Rogers called this a helping relationship, an interest by one per- son with empathic understanding of and un- conditional positive regard for the problems of another person. Effective therapists are congruent individuals who create a process equation in the therapeutic contact which in- tends that there be more open expression and functional use of the client's inner resources. T he client must be encouraged to rely o n organismic feeling tones, which reflect sin- cere values and preferences that would set l ife on a h e althy t r ack i f t h e y w e r e o n l y taken into account. Hence, the therapist is a facilitator of this genuine acceptance of what t he person is r a t he r t h a n a n i n d i v i d u a l striving to mold or shape the person accord- ing to some preconceived image or plan. This emphasis on the spontaneous and. genuine gives Rogerian theory a decidedly existential- Rogers considered insight to be the percep- tion of new meaning in the client's own phe- n omenal experience. He did no t d w e l l o n transference in the F r eudian sense, feeling that if the person does indeed transfer feel- ings meant for another onto the therapist, it is the behavioral manner and attitude of the therapist that has invited this t r ansference. The client-centered relationship focuses on c ongruence — both in th e b e h avior o f t h e therapist and it is hoped, as time passes, in the behavior of the c l ient as w e ll. Psycho- therapy is a process of change in which the s elf-concept comes more into l in e w i t h t h e o rganismic valuing process, thanks to t h e open, accepting, positive regard of the thera- pist in the t h erapeutic relationship. Rogers broke down this process of change into seven stages of movement. He also conducted ex- tensive empirical studies of these stages. In the final analysis, awareness was the central c oncept in R o g ers's definition o f m e n t a l health. Psychologically well-adjusted people a re open to experience, trusting in t h eir o r - g anism, accepting of t h e i r subjectivity as evaluators of their p h enomenal experience, and willing to be a process of change. The emphasis on organismic trust led Rogers to envision what we have termed a u n i v ersal natural ethic in human relations. That is, he came to refer to a w i sdom in o r g a nic feel- ings, leading to natural valuations made of l ife which are beyond th e so cial o r der a s such. Organisms that react naturally to their feelings about things enhance their survival chances, and particularly so when considered as a member of a s p ecies. The species is likely to survive if its members take organis- mic valuations into consideration. This growing e m p hasis on n a t u r a listic bases of valuation paralleled Rogers's own d evelopment as therapist, moving him f r o m a one-to-one therapist in individual therapy to a facilitator of the encounter group. Since Rogers always held that congruence in one person promotes congruence in another and vice versa, in the final analysis, every person becomes a therapist. Hence, even in an en - counter group where only one f acilitator is present, several individuals may promote through healthy i n terpersonal relationships of a congruent nature the psychological ad- justment of all the members.

Too many Christians, said Kierkegaard, repeated meaningless prayers and nodded i n a g r e e- ment to dogmas of their religion which they never understood, much less put into practice. Religion was no longer a living force in their lives. People had become alienated from their f aith. Nietzsche had a si m i la r c r i t i c ism t o make of the established philosophies of his t ime.

Marlene is a wretchedly sad and unloved person, who turns all signs of a ff ection i nt o h u m o r ous taunts. She belittles what she wants most. Sartre said that psychology as a science of be- havior has become alienated f rom its subject matter because, rather than capturing phe- nomenal reality in its theories, it has turned human beings into m a c hines.' Sartre also strongly developed the idea first suggested by Kierkegaard — that group pressures like na- tional identities (being an American, German, and so on ) have become so great in our time that everyone lives in self-alienation. We can- not be who we spontaneously and phenom- enally are because of the many subtle pres- sures to conform, to be as others would have us be and as everyone around us is. Authenticity Kierkegaard was the first philosopher to point g roup or culture define who w e a r e (self- alienation ) . Modern concepts of th e m a s s person, who sells out by submitting to what the system says he or she ought to be, have t heir roots in K i e r k egaard's attack on t h e l ifeless rituals o f t h e C h r i s t i a n c h u r c h . ' Nietzsche spoke of the >vill to po~er (see p. 135) as being th e h u ma n p e r son's funda- mental capacity to be self-creative and hence authentic (real, genuine, spontaneous, and so on ). As long as we base our lives on what we are — what we think, f e el, desire — then we cannot be self-alienated or self-estranged. Our conscience urges us only to be free, to be ourselves as we constantly experience life unafraid; gui/t is that feeling we suffer when we do not assume this responsibility but let others define who we are.' Jaspers' philosophy dealt with the opposi- tion between authentic and inauthentic living. He referred to Dasein as being there, or literally, the objective fact that we do m ate- rially exist.' Nature automatically determines that we exist in this sense. But another realm of existence that Jaspers termed being one - selj demands personal action before it is real- ized (created ). To be oneself requires effort, personal decision, and the selection of alter- n atives that might not p r ov e p o p ular. T h e group cannot provide this being-oneself for u s. It can, however, set limits o n w h a t w e might be. The point is not to reject all of its views about what is good and /or proper in life, but to realize that only individual effort can bring about being-oneself. For Heidegger, authenticity was fulfilling one's possibilities.' That is, we ca n b ecome what we aspire to be. As humans we can see a \"potential being\" ahead of us and work to become that unique self. The term Dasein as used by Heidegger includes this possibility, this tentative projection of what \" might b e\" in the future. We also realize that our pos- s ibilities are not u n l i m i t ed. O t h e r h u m a n beings have established certain p r escribed ways of doing things, as codified in our laws. We can go along with t hi s established rou- t ine without question — which would m a k e us inauthentic — or we can evaluate, accept, discard, and affirm our own ways of possible living — which when realized in our l i f estyle w ould make us authentic.'

We admire Aaron, for though he is a conventional person, he has a style all his own which he obviously has carved out for him- self and within which he feels at home.

To the objectivist, a person is \"anyone\" or \"everyman\" or a \"plastic p erson.\" The danger is that w e a l l o w o u r - selves to become a part of this objective mass, t his faceless crowd of o b jects wh ich m o v e about like ants conforming to the manipula- tions of science, church, and country without subjectively examining and creating our life- styles for ourselves. To be is to emerge from the background of n o t h ingness as a figure emerges from the ground (see p. 570). Subject versus Object The person who l i ves in authentically, said Kierkegaard, who lets others define his or her identity, begins to think of that identity as an object and not as a subject.\" Ob jects are things to be factually described, manipu- lated, and put in their place because they are p assive. The subjective side to l i fe, on t h e other hand, involves action, a desire to cre- ate that which is not yet factual but a mere possibility. In morality, for example, we pro- ject an \"ought\" as a possibility and then make i t a reality in our l i fe. We say \"A man a n d w oman who marry ought to b e f a i t hful t o each other,\" and then create this pattern in our own, subjectively determined pattern of behavior. If w e m e r el y e x press this moral principle objectively, it remains a mere pos- sibility and hence we never make it so.\" To b ring moral p r ecepts alive, we m u s t fi r s t think of o u r selves subjectively, recognizing thereby that we have a unique responsibility to do something more than just pay lip ser- vice to what is being stated. Jaspers made a similar point in speaking about the error o f l e t t i n g m o d er n s cience define who we are as persons. Science levels everything on earth into a common form of description and analysis, confounding thereby t he objective realm of being-there with th e subjective realm of being-oneself.

Randal may have entered the priesthood on equally unreasoned grounds — to obtain the same cheap solution to a l if e p r o blem th at faces all of us. Sartre called this self-decep- tion bad faith, by which he meant letting our- selves down and not really fulfilling the pos- s ibilities open to us in l i f e.\" T h e t h r u s t o f existentialism is thus to put the individual at the center of life, personally responsible for what then takes place in that life. We cannot sidestep this responsibility and claim that we behave as we do because of our parents, our s ociety, or our r acial inheritance. We m u st r ecognize that e ve n w h e n w e r e f u s e t o choose, to act, to commit ourselves to a direc- tion in life, vve have aLready chosen.

He tends to blame others for t h i s sense of boredom, but the truth is he is per- sonally unable to commit hi mself creatively to life. Hence, as Heidegger said, his anx- i ety reflects his nothingness, which in t u r n manifests itself as boredom.\" Anxiety can be a constructive factor i n l i f e , f o r a s b o t h Kierkegaard and Heidegger stressed, out of anxiety is born the motivation to conquer in- decision and self-deception. Anxiety is in one sense the beginning of self-affirmation. We are afraid, but this means we \"are,\" and in our being, we can as identities alive to the p ossibilities in things bring about a t o m o r - row that is more authentic than today. Absurd The last concept we will consider as typical of existentialistic philosophy is absurd. This word has been used in both a positive and a negative sense by the existentialists. Kierke- gaard used it in the more positive sense, as a b asis for belief. For something t o b e t r u e „ we have to believe it, and, said Kierkegaard, when we come right down to it, all belief is subjective in nature. This makes all truth sub- jective as well. Well, it i s c l early absurd to Anxiety, Dread, Despair The existentialists use words l ike an x i e ty, dread, and despair to d e s cribe inauthentic living. Kierkegaard spoke of. anxiety as the \"sickness unto death,\"\" r e sulting from self- alienation (inauthenticity ) and g i v in g t h e person nothing but despair to look forward to.

Yet when we think about this subjectively, it is the very absurdity of this sequence of events that lends it believability.\" Paradoxes and absurdities always seem to bring us up short, make us think about what they are driving at; i n t h i s wa y t he y carry great weight as evidence. When we honestly look at some things privately and openly, as s ubjects, we are moved to t h i n k , \"That is just so unusual, so odd, so different that there must be some truth to it. It is absurdly true.\" Sartre, on the other hand, used the term absurd in a more negative sense. He tended to view absurdity as a way of talking about human existence. The human drama is full o f absurdities. We h av e t h e a b s u rdity o f death, bringing to a n en d n a t u r e's highest creation.\" We h av e th e absurdity of c l ash- ing moralities, where opposed sides are drawn a long a lin e o f a r m e d c o n fl ict a i m in g t o d emolish one another in the n ame of t h e i r God (Who is often the same ). We have the absurdity of birth, in w h ich material advan- tages are partitioned according to c l ass or race. And the more complex modern life be- comes, the more absurd it becomes. The im- plications of Sartre's rather pessimistic summa- tion is that i f w e w o u l d e ach c ontemplate these absurdities in our own subjective state of existence, we could in time remove them through individual commitment and action. B uddhism. Oriental p h i l osophers and h i s - torians stress the style of thought among In- dian, Chinese, and Japanese peoples.\" The remarkable thing about Buddhistic thought is that, although it differs from existentialism on the active-passive dimension (see below ), t his religiophilosophical world v i e w s h a r es many ideas with existential philosophy. Many of the pop (popular) philosophies of the 1960s and 1970s in the West have combined existential themes of authenticity and s u b- j ect-object with t h e themes of B u d d histic writings, so that today we often hear Kierke- gaard and Sartre being wound into conversa- tions centering on some wise Indian guru or Japanese Zen master. In this section, we will try to capture the essential themes of Oriental philosophy, and to show how t hey r elate to existential-phenomenological thought. Existential Themes in Oriental Philosophy In recent times there has been much interest shown in the philosophy of the East by West- erners, particularly in the world view of Zen The Quest for Unity Buddhism took root from the even more an- cient religion of H i n d u i sm, wh ich t r aces its lineage back to the ancient sacred writings of t he Vedic li t erature i n I n d i a (about 1500 a.c.).\" These writings placed great stress on the interrelatedness of everything in lived ex- perience, so that a state of alienation would be considered very unnatural and even im- m oral.\" T hi s t h eme — of searching for t h e unity that exists in nature, which must not be violated by introducing false dichotomies or intellectualizing about nature r e m a ins fore- most in Buddhistic philosophy. We see here a parallel to existentialism s authenticity in that what is most authentic, real, and natural is what lives spontaneously and free of what must always be arbitrary and forced distinc- W estern science teaches us that to k n o w a nything, we must first break i t d o w n i n t o its presumed parts ( reduce the one to t h e m any pieces that make i t u p ). Buddhistic tlOnS."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 Existential Analysis or Daseinsanalysis: Binswanger and Boss 625 philosophy runs counter to such reductionism, challenging us to r e m ember what the ge- staltists taught us (see p. 569), that we can never find the whole by merely summing up its parts. The concept of complete totality in all things is captured by the Hi ndu concep- ception of Buddha These .concepts symbolize both a deity and also the ultimate in unity we all can find if we w il l bu t m ake an internal search, finding within our personal identity a kind of universal soul to which we can re- late. Each person makes this internal search individually, and it i n v olves an active com- mitment similar to what we saw occurring in the Jungian individuating (balancing ) pro- cess (see p. 206). Jung, of course, relied on Buddhistic writings to support his theory of the centering of the personality. According to the traditions of H i n d ui sm and Buddhism, all theories about reality or the nature of life are equally true.\" Western- ers presume that one point of view m ust be right and the others wrong, hence they search for a single account of reality by looking out- w ard, empirically testing this an d t h a t i n hopes of finding the t r u t h. T r u t h i s i n t e r - preted as something split oR from error, and what is erroneous is therefore useless, to be tossed aside onto a slag heap of meaningless experience. The Eastern philosophy strives to liberate the person from this outward search and replace it with a kind of internal exami- nation of the question-answer, proof-finding process itself. As a counter to the splitting-up process in knowledge seeking, early Buddhis- tic philosophy proposed a negation o f t h e dualities being proposed by other philosophies of that time. The great Buddhistic philoso- pher Nagarjuna (c. A.D. 100 — 150 ) proposed a widely cited Eightfold Negation. In doing so, he claimed there was neither birth nor death, neither coming nor g o i ng , n e i ther p e rma- nence nor extinction, and neither unity nor diversity.\" This denial sounds strange to our Western ear, but the point involved is that when we first pose dichotomies like life versus death or coming and going, we of n e cessity force ourselves to say where we are in r e lation to them. Are we dead or alive t What is death > What is life> Is nature dead or alive> When w e die, are we no longer a part of n a t u r e > A re we coming or are we going in l i fe > I n relation to what t If we are going, then what direction ought we to take| If we are coming, where have we been and why did we leave> AII of these ridiculous questions, said Nagar- juna, spring to our m i nd s only b ecause we first split up our existence needlessly. What Nagarjuna sought was the \"middle path\" of existence, or as it is called, nirvana. By rejecting such dichotomies placed onto n ature, we avoid t h e t e n s io n o f e x t r e m e s (either-or ) and attain a b a l ance combining b oth sides into a unity, totality, or \" m i d d l e path.\" Once again, Jung's centering process in individuation best captures the meaning here of how we can find our complete selves inwardly and attain a m or e b a l anced mid- point (see p. 231 ). It is clear that Buddhistic p hilosophy is heavily dialectical and that i t contrasts dramatically with the more demon- strative emphasis given to logical reasoning in the West (see p. 11). The Indian Hindu, for example, would not reason as a Western scientist and say that we can see what is there on a table or see nothing at all; in stead, the Indian mentalit y h as it that \"looking at t h e table, we can say that there is no cat th ere, just as we can say that there is a book there.\" \" It is when we afFirm (express a belief in ) our own body, our own mind, our own per- sonal egos that we separate ourselves from Brahma (or Buddha ).

Once the focus of our search for knowledge has shifted from are (self) to are not (unity, Brahma ), we rise to a l evel of harmony (balance, centering ) that transcends a ll our previous experience and where di - chotomies are unnecessary and the striving for certainty is pointless because a direct knowl- edge of nature is achieved by becoming one with it.

It also appears to the Westerner that the Buddhistic philosophy achieves en- lightenrnent by denying the validity of a ques- tion put to nature. Though this is true, we must appreciate that the Easterner has tradi- tionally sought to live with and in the natural order, rather than seeking to alter it or even destroy it, as our fears today about pollution and catastrophic warfare surely imply can take place. In a sense, Western thought has em- phasized the thesis-antithesis schism of dia- lectic, whereas Eastern thought puts its em- phasis on the synthesis. Probably the most f amous of d i a lectical concepts of Oriental philosophy is the y i n - yang principle, w hich can be traced to the ancient collection of wri t ings known as the Tao Te Ching (c. 600 s.c., probably of mul- tiple authorship ). This principle attempts to explain the actions of all things in nature and might be contrasted with th e d e m onstrative principle of constancy which Freud wrestled with as a tool of explanation (see p. 53). The yin force or element is described as passive, receiving, and meek (on the face of things ); yet, like the female or mother, yin represents the potential for infinite creation in the world. In this sense, yin is closer to tao or the tt ay- that is, the creative principle that patterns the g rowth and development of e v e rything i n nature. The yang force is m or e active and b old, showing its power openly i n a m o r e masculine sense. Harmony as a kind of dialec- tical balance between yin and yang is most d esirable, although it is t r a d itional in B u d - dhisrn for the enlightened person to hide the more aggressive yang forces and thus appear overly passive to the Western intellect. Yin and yang thus interact dialectically to bring forward the creativity of tao. We can see this exchange of active and passive in all things, as in, for example, the developments of the weather in which wind and storm (yang) are followed by sunny calm (yin) to encourage growth (tao) in all vegetation. The Buddhistic ideal of the strong (yang) person appearing passive (yin) has even been i ncorporated into t h e m a r t i a l a r t s o f t h e Orient, such as jujitsu or kung fu . Th e p r e- ferred style in these encounters is to use the opponent's aggressive moves (yang) as a self- defeating act. For example, by deftly grasp- ing the arms of a person who lunges for us, we can fall backward and, using our legs as a lever, carry this lunge through to catapult the aggressor behind us. The d e f t ness and style of our action is effortless (yin), but the outcome can be devastating nevertheless. Not all Chinese philosophy is dialectical. Confucianism is more demonstrative in tone, oriented to tradition and parental authority.\" Confucius (551 — 479 s.c.) was critical of the rulers of his time, whom he felt were uncon- cerned for the welfare of their citizenry.

H e b e - lieved that there is a right and a wrong way in which to behave, and it was absolutely es- sential to respect one's parents as supreme a uthorities. The demonstrative flavor of hi s approach is clear, and we would look in vain t o find a d i a l e c t ical contradiction i n h i s W l ltlllg S. But the more characteristic spirit of Chi- nese thought is dialectical, and there was even a dialectician school of philosophy founded by Mo Ti which represents one of those unbe- lievable parallels in the history of t h o u ght. Mo Ti lived from c. 470 to 391 a.c., a span of years which is almost identical to the life of the great Greek dialectician, Socrates (who lived c. 470 — 399 a.c. ). There was no possibility o f cultural contact here. The fact that t w o human beings of such diverse backgrounds could frame a world view around the pl ay of dialectic surely argues that there is some- thing basic to human nature in this opposi- tional, contradictory, paradoxical manner of thought. It was not u n ti l 1 227 that D o g en brought the Soto Zen sect of Buddhism to Japan. We Find in his writings the paradoxical s tatements of this p h i losophy, such as th e often cited query \"What is the sound of one hand, clapping>\" Such paradoxical statements are called (oans, and they are frequently used as the focus of attention in meditation exer- cises (see below ). Muso (or Soseki ) followed Dogen, and the general style of master-stu- dent instruction in Zen was perfected under his leadership and example. As we have noted above, Zen Buddhism is the speciFic school of thought that was popularized in America, beginning in the 1950s and continuing to the present day (influenced to a great extent by the writings of. Alan W. Watts\" ). Thus far we have seen many similarities between the philosophy of existentialism and Oriental philosophy. Both approaches call on the individual subject to b ecome authenti- cally balanced and in tune with the world as experienced phenomenally. Both approaches stress the alienation that results when we try to press onto nature our theories rather than listening to nature sensitively and accepting what we hear without bias or prejudice. They each value sincerity and tranquil acceptance of life a~ it ir. But there is a major difference between Eastern Buddhistic p r ecepts and W estern existential precepts, having to d o e ssentially with th e n o t ion o f c o m m i t m e n t . As we have seen, the existentialist stresses the need for action, for putting one's values t o action in some concrete way r a t her t h a n accepting the status quo. The Zen Buddhist, on the other hand, views such commitment as an inward action, a coming to terms with oneself rather than with the external world. The external world is not to be acted upon so much as accepted for what it is. Existential- istic arguments were used to justify civil dis- obedience in America during the 1960s Viet- n am War p eriod. Believing i n w h a t t h e y were committed to, certain ind i v i duals took a Nietzschean leap into th e s i t u a tion a n d burned draft (conscription ) cards, demon- strated illegally, destroyed records and prop- erty, and so on. The stress here on yang over yin is not consistent with Buddhistic precepts, where presumably a more passive resistance would be the style followed. This contrast between East and West can also be seen in a comparison of Socrates as dialectician with t h e t y p i ca l Z e n m a s t er' s method of instruction.\" Though both meth- o ds of seeking insight, kn o w l edge, or e n - lightenment are based on a d i a l ectical ex- c hange between teacher and s t u d ent, t h e manner in which this instruction is carried out differs tremendously.

He might give an answer that is completely unrelated to the question; he might simply raise a finger or a f ist as a kind of reply; or he mi ght pick u p a small stick and t h ro w i t a t t h e s t u d e n t . Often he remains silent. If the student prods for knowledge long enough, the master might ask the student to meditate by focusing on some koan (\" What is the sound of one hand clapping > \" ) . In the l i t erature of Z e n , o n e r o u t i n e ly reads of students going from one master to another, trying various questions out on them, getting assorted replies or queries of the para- doxical type mentioned, all the while suffer- ing a sense of almost unbearable frustration.

Socrates at times frustrated his stu- dents, but this was due to the sense of con- fusion his i n v olved questioning sometimes brought on. The Socratic dialogues did not always end in clear-cut answers, and occa- sionally they led t o u n e x pected paths that created more problems for the student than they solved. But the Zen student's irritation s temmed from th e f r u s t r ation of n o t e v e n getting started on the road to k n o w ledge- or so it seemed! What students had to learn, of course, was that there is no such road Al l o f t h e . ques- tions they put to the Zen m aster could not s atisfy their hunger for k n o w l e dge i n a n y case. Knowledge must lead somewhere, it must find that focus or nodal point at which oneness (Buddha) is grasped, understood, and accepted. Questions do not lead to such unity. They break up the totality of experi- ence, posing those dichotomies that we pointed out above detract from unity. When they attain per fect enlightenment, Zen stu- dents no longer raise questions. The Hindus call this understanding of the unity of nature nonattachment. This does not mean that the Zen student forgoes life or loses interest in the commitments of everyday experience. Emo- tions are a vital aspect of this t otality, and p leasures can be taken so long as t hey d o not come between the person and the experi- ential totality.\" Someone who would pursue pleasures in a selfish manner, for ex ample, would destroy the unity of experience which knows no selfishness. Nonattachment merely signifies that the person can experience all sides to life, feeling both positively and nega- tively on the same experience without fear- ing that this somehow violates the logic of life. Life is dialectical and adrruts of contra- dictions within its overriding unity. Psychotherapy and Zen Buddhism Zen Buddhism is sometimes considered in the context of psychotherapy, and b efore leav- ing this section on Oriental ph i losophy, we should address this possibility. A c t ually, a person who entered a relationship with a Zen master would not b e g e t t in g \" t h e r apized,\" if we mean by this having one person some- how cure or readjust the lifestyle of a second person.

As we have seen, the Zen master would have no formal ideology — no theory- to oRer. Distinctions between conscious and unconscious would not be accepted. In time, t he point would b e d e m onstrated that r a - tional considerations — the verbal questions and answers we discussed above — only get in the way of the person's liberation from the problems of his or her past life. We have to forgo our dependence on rational concepts, on the explicit, demonstratively precise ex- planations we assume must be present in life to account for why things are as they are.\" In a sense, Zen would consider such intellec- tualized eRorts at explanation to be a form o f defense mechanism, a way w e h av e o f dismissing immediate phenomenal experi- ence in preference to some way we want to think, believe, or justify what is taking place. We can turn oR our real feelings and go on intellectualizing. Zen practices are quite simi- lar to Rogerian therapy in t h i s s ense (see Chapter 9 ). But there is more to Zen, particu- larly in regard to the meditative experience. Z en masters since D ogen h av e d i s t i n - guished between thin (ing, nor-thin (ing, and nonrhin (ing.\" T h i n k i n g i n v o l v e s c a t ego- rizing things, naming them, applying arbi- trary schemes in questions, answers, and so on. Not-thinking refers to a rejection of this process, a refusal to conceptualize anything. But nonthinking is neither of t h ese things. Nonthinking is a preconceptual state of mind, a purely spontaneous phenomenal state of being which is fundamental to both thinking and not-thinking. When the Zen master med- itated i n a s eated posture, the aim h e r e i s to attain the state of nonthinking. This state i s said to t r a n scend t i m e (transcendental meditation ). That is, the rneditator steps out of time's unilinear (demonstrative ) flow for brief periods to fix his or her attention on a koan, a mantra (richly flowing word ), or a manila (graphic, usually circular image ). The focusing of consciousness here immerses the person in the present and also removes him or her completely from th e c u stomary state of seeking t o c o n c eptualize (name, know, question ) things or negate such con- ceptualizations. When the person is able to achieve a state of nonthinking, Zen advocates contend that h e or she has arrived at th e v i r t u a l r o o t - s ource of all thought. Harking back to o u r discussion of gestalt psychology in Ch apter 9 (see p. 567), we might say that nonthinking is like a generalized ground on which mind must build. Once we achieve this state, we do not need to review our past lives in that freely associated sense that Freud employed to find the causes of today's problems. We have gone beyond such mental conceptions to the basic flow of life as ground to all else. This capacity to transcend the fixed figures of the mind (that is, conceptions, ideas ) and m elt into the g r ound o f a u n i fi e d t o t a l i t y (Buddha) sets the person free from so-called unconscious forces, fixations, hang-ups, or Functioning in the present the person can now return from the meditative interlude to b egin a new middle path to l i v in g w i t h o u t d ichotomizing it at every tu rn . T h i s i s n o t simply a return to normalcy, it is a positive elevation, an a d v a nce t o s u p e r n o r m alcy. There is no longer any need for resistance or defense because there is nothing t o d e f end against. If unconscious conflicts existed be- fore, they only did so because the person had not yet transcended the unnatural d i v i sive- ness of his or her psyche to live a more bal- lanced life of nirvana.

Biographical Overview of Ludwig Binswanger and Medard Boss Two men have taken the lead i n a p p lying existential philosophy to personality and psy- chotherapy.

The actual founder of existential analysis or Da seinsanalyre (after Heidegger ) was Ludwig B i n swanger, who was born in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland on 1> April 1881. There was a tradition of medicine in his family, and Ludwig decided to follow it, taking the M.D. degree from the Univer- sity of Zurich in 1907. He studied under jung for a time and also took an internship with Eugen Bleuler (see p. 177). ln 1911 Binswanger succeeded his father as director of the Sanatorium Bellevue at Kreuz- lingen, a position he held for over four decades during which he earned an international rep- utation. Although he studied with ju ng, the major therapeutic interest among the Swiss in the first decade of this century was Freudian psychoanalysis. Binswanger became active in t his area of p s ychiatry an d g r a d u a lly c e - mented a personal friendship with F r eud- who visited him in 1912 when B i n swanger was ill.\" G r a d u ally, h o w ever, B i n swanger became disenchanted with Freud's seeming need to explain human behavior i n e ssen- tially dehumanizing terms — as being due to energies, psychic systems, and the like. Some- where in t hi s t r a n slation, Bin swanger felt Freud was losing the phenomenal reality of human experience. There followed a period o f reading and study d u r in g w h i c h B i n s - wanger became interested in the philosophy of Heidegger.

Binswanger delivered a lecture in Vienna on the occasion o f Freud's eightieth birthday i n w h i c h h e attempted to contrast psychoanalysis with a more existential view.\" Th e p a per was not well received by the Freudians, and not until recent times has existential thought made in- roads on the c l assical analytical position. ' B inswanger and Fr eud r e m ained on g o o d personal terms through all of their disagree- ments.\" In 1956 Binswanger stepped down from hi s d i r e c torship o f t h e S a n a t o r i um Bellevue, though he continued to study and write until his death in 1966. Our second existentialist, Medard B oss, also graduated from the medical school of the U niversity of Z u r i ch. H e w a s b o r n i n S t . Gallen, Switzerland, on 4 October 1903 and is currently professor of psychotherapy at the University of Zurich Medical School, as well as the director of g e I n s t i t ut e o f D a s eins- analytic Therapy t h ere. Boss also studied Jung, Bleuler (his former teacher ), and, of course, Freud. Though he wa s t o d i s agree with the founder of Da s einsanalyse (trans- lated as \"Daseinsanalysis\" ) on certain points, Boss acknowledged that he was initially stim- ulated to study Heidegger by the writings of a nd then p e rsonal contacts wit h L u d w i g Binswanger.\" Boss became a close personal friend of Martin H e i degger as well. He has written more extensively than B i n swanger and has also lectured in th e U n i te d St ates and South America. For many years Boss was the president of the International Society for Medical Psychotherapy. Boss uses the ter m Daseinsanalysis, b ut we c a n c o n s i der t h i s translation i n t erchangeable with D a s e i n s analyse, both of which are synonymous with \"existential analysis.\" Personality Theory Structural Constructs The Centrality o f Phenomenal Meaning for the Person as a Body-Mind Gestalt Phenomenologists believe that the only reason the so-called problem of how body can inter- act with mind arises in psychology is because we have split the person up into t h ese two sides in the first place. When experience is studied phenomenally, Bin sw anger noted, t he person \"is and remains a unit .\" \" B o d y and mind are always found to be two sides to the same thing — being! This is w h at i n t e r- ests the existentialists, the study of being, or to use the technical term meaning the same thing, ontology. When we look at t he prob- lem of mind v ersus body ontologically, we find that it d oes not exist. People live out their lives without drawing such distinctions; they know themselves as living beings pri- marily and only consider a mind-body issue when it is raised for them by scientists as a theoretical i s sue. P s y chological s c i e ntists would like to solve this problem of their own making, but it i s o f c o u r se u n solvable be- cause it is based on a phenomenologically un- true division of our being.\" Since scientiFic explanatioris must be based on what is there (bodily substance ) and not on what is not there (substanceless thought ), psychologists conclude that they must reduce the phenomenal to the physical. ' Existence is viewed as what really exists, and in the pro- c ess of scientific explanation, we fi n d t h e person being turned from a su b j e ct in to a material object.\" Yet Boss noted: \"Without a s ubject nothing at al l w o u l d e x i s t t o c o n - front objects and to imagine them as such. True, this implies that every object, every- thing 'objective' — in being merely objectivized"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 Existential Analysis or Daseinsanalysis: Binswanger and Boss 633 by the subject — is the most subjective thing possible.\" \" Ph enomenally c o n sidered, w e are our experience. We do n ot h a ve i d e as about things; we are o ur ideas.\" Wh en w e stand before a beautiful tree, we do not face it with our consciousness or perceive it with our eyes or brains. The tree is simply there in phenomenal awareness, it presents itself to us as we experience it for what it is.\" This is not to deny that brain processes go on as we come to know the tree. The tree's image surely appears on our retina, and ner- vous impulses can be measured as they move toward certain areas of our brain. But what has this to do with the meaning we experi- e nce in our r e l ations with th e t r ee > V e r y little, said Binswanger, who added concern- ing the r ol e o f s u c h b i o l o g ical p r o cesses, \"What we perceive are 'first and f o r emost' not impressions of taste, tone, smell or touch, not even things or objects, but rather, mean- ings.\"\" Boss enlarged this theme by noting that \". .. man cannot see, hear, and smell because he has eyes, ears, and a nose; he is able to have eyes, ears, and a nose because his very essence is luminating and world-dis- closing.\"\" T o s u g gest that the eye \"causes\" the meaning of tree through vision is to com- pletely overlook the phenomenal realm. Hence, as existentialists, we may speak of the \"body,\" but we recognize in this merely a partial realm of existence, one that has no real significance for phenomenal experience. The s cientific truths about b r ai n f u n c t i on, t h e chemical actions of the nervous system, and so on, may well be valid, but the subjective meanings of existence are not to be found in chemical substances or biological processes; indeed, the concepts of instinct, libido, and drive are considered equally meaningless as descriptive terms for experience — regardless of their facticity (the given fact that a person has instincts as he or she has ears ).\" Bins- wanger referred to the bodily sphere of experi- ence as the eigentvelt (see below ). Existence, Being in t-he -Wo-rM, and Dasein as Endo@ ed' or Disclosed The core theoretical constructs used by our existentialists are ex i s t e nce, b e i n g in the- - tvorlcl, and Dasein. All these terms refer in one way or another to being, and we can ac- tually think of t hem as synonyms. Being is central to existence, and it transcends in im- portance all other q u a l i t ies o f e x p e rience, such as colors, the size and weight of mate- rials, the feelings we may experience as emo- tions, and so on. Being is something in phe- nomenal existence, even though i t i s n o t something that can be captured by the usual terms we employ to say what something is. To clarify what we are driving at h ere, we c an review an argument that w a s fi rs t a d - vanced by Hegel and later adapted by Hei- d egger concerning the nature of being.\" I t runs as follows: suppose we were to explain the being-ness of one of nature's most com- mon items, the chunk of earth k n ow n as a rocket. If we now ask, \"Is the rock's being-ness due to its color>\" the answer would be, \"No, its being is not due to its color.\" Comparable questions about the rock's shape, its material substance, its weight, and so forth would also be answered in the negative. A. rock's being or not-being is not quite any of these quali- ties — even when we put them into combina- tions (gestalts ). Stripped of all it s q u alities, therefore, we would still have failed to cap- ture the is-ness of the rock. Even more para- doxical, after all of th e q u alities have been r emoved from th e r o c k , w e w o u l d h a v e nothing Heidegger as H.egel before him thus concluded that being and n o t h i n g ness are closely related. Hegel considered these as op- posites and Heidegger viewed these as inde- pendent though partially identical states of existence.\""},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"634 Kan tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook Part II I One might say: \"But this is surely non- sense. For all practical purposes and insofar as it is possible to prove anything, a rock is the sum of its qualities, which I perceive and name as a 'thing.' When the properties are not there, the rock does not exist and there is no such concept as 'heing' to he concerned about.\" Granting this retort for a rock, what does one say in response to a person's sel f examination?

But Bins- wanger and Boss do not come at this study in exactly the same way. B i n swanger em- phasized the ways in which phenomenal ex- perience is made possible or endoued w i t h meaning by the h u man b eing's most basic ways of looking at and thinking about it. To endow is to furnish something which in turn m akes something else occur. Boss, on t h e other hand, emphasized the m e aning d i s closed to the human being by existence, as if it were not so much how we look at existence that matters but how existence reveals itself t o us. A d i sclosure is an opening up o r a making known. Returning to the example of phenomenally perceiving a tree, Binswanger would suggest that our phenomenal frame of reference lent (endowed ) meaning to t ree, whereas Boss would say that th e t r e e simply presented (disclosed ) itself t o o u r p henomenal awareness. Thi s c o n t r ast i n v iews wil l b e c om e c l e arer a s w e m o v e t hrough the m or e t e c h nical t e rm s o f t h e theories. T urning t o B i n s w a nger fi r st , a m a j o r structural construct employed in his version of existential analysis might be called the a priori ontological structure.\" 9 p r i ori me a ns \"coming before,\" and ontological structure refers to the kind of beginning frame of ref- e rence the person has i n c o m i n g a t l i f e . Binswanger also called these basic assump- tions about life toorLd designs. W-e say that Melissa is an optimist because she greets each day with an expectation that everything will go well. Greta, on the other hand, is called a pessimist because she always e xpects the worst to happen. These are the attitudes that Melissa and Greta endo' their existence with daily — beginning assumptions of a positive or negative variety. Examples like these are rather complex and far removed from the a priori ontological structures that we all bring to bear as infants and young children. Bins- w anger held that w e a l l b e g i n v e r y e a r l y in life making certain assumptions, given our very narrow and poorly formed understand- ing of things. One such example of a primi- tive world-design might be the belief by an i nfant that th e w o r l d i s something to be sucked and tasted, since this is the extent of his or her experience in the first weeks of life. T hese a priori structures are not t o b e thought of as inherited ideas, nor was Bins- w anger interested in trying to fin d ou t h o w many ontological conceptions a person carries about at any one time — though he did men- tion this point in his theory of illness.\" What B inswanger wanted to convey i n t h i s c o n - struct is that human beings begin to f r a m e a matrix of meaning within wh ich they con- tinually k no w t h e i r o n g o i n g e x p e r i e nce."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 Existential Analysis or Daseinsanalysis: Binswanger and Hoss 635 simistic fashion. There are various ways in which the existen- tial analyst can come to recognize a person' s most basic presumptions. \"Language [that is, what a person says about life ], the po- etic imagination, and — above all — the dream, draw from this basic ontological structure.\"\" Optimism or pessimism would surely be easy to identify in how a person speaks about life or the sorts of poetry he or she would write. Dream themes are full of such attitudes as well. Boss was none too pleased with Binswan- ger's explanation of ho w o u r b e i n g - in-the- world supposedly takes place — as if it were framed in b y a n o v e r r i d i n g a b s t r action coming before concrete experience is pos- sible.\" For Boss, existence is not predicated on anything; it si mply happens. Being is a concrete happening that needs no preliminary structure to lend it meaning. \"Fundamentally, 'being' always means 'coming forth and last- ing.' How could any such coming forth and lasting be possible without a lightened realm into which this happening can take place|\"\" In other words, if we let M elissa and Greta tell us phenomenally about their lives, they will in n o s ense tell us about assumptions, world-designs, or ontological structures. These are conceptions that Binswanger used, but they are not part of the immediate experience of our two women. Melissa's life simply hap- pens in optimistic fashion, whereas Greta s life continually discloses itself to her in pes- Boss viewed life as if i t w e r e c onstantly emerging under the rays of a torch or flash- light, carried by the living person. The rays are actually the person's awareness of concrete experience, the structured phenomena of life. As Boss noted, \"The very word 'phenomena' ... is derived from phainesthai, i.e., to shine forth, to appear, unveil itself, come out of concealment or darkness.\"\" Hence, for Boss, a phenomenon is \"that which shows itself.\"\" Binswanger would say that the phenomenon is found most directly in th e l a n g u age ex- pressions of an individual as a world-design.\" There is a kind of chicken-egg problem de- veloping here, for according to Binswanger, the world-design helps frame the meanings to follow in p h enomenal experience. Boss, on the other hand, pointed out that it could well b e that th e w o r l d - design i t self h a s b e e n shown to the person out of a more primitive (original ) form of being.\" Both men stressed the importance of mean ing to existence. They also were in agreement that existence consists of a being (sein) there (da) that is always immediate and ongoing, a right-now happening that must be studied in its own terms and not taken out of context or otherwise contorted by theory. Hence, we can think of the Dasein (there-being ) as be- ing-in-the-world or existing concretely. There is also the idea here of the human being as an aspect of nature different from, for exam- ple, subhuman creatures or inanimate struc- tures like rocks. Binswanger noted the \"dis- tinction between human existence (Dasein ) or being-in-the-world, on the one hand, and nature on the other.\"\" Boss defined Dasein in terms of his light analogy, which he called luminarion, and emphasized that the t h e re (da) of Dasein is a luminated happening.\" We can essentially equate luminarion w i t h disclosing, as the following definition by Boss makes clear: \"Dasein, thus being essentially ' and primordially of a d i sclosing, i.e., lumi- nating, nature, shines forth at any given time. But — as with every kind of 'light' — its lumi- nation varies as to color and brightness.\"\" The fact that l u m i n a tion v a r ies u n der- scores the fact that Dasein (existence, being- in-the-world ) takes o n d i ff e r en t f e a t u r es. Binswanger thought that D a sein i s e x peri- enced in both a temporal and spatial sense. O ur existence passes through t i me , an d i t extends outward in various directions. Even"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"636 Ka n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook Part II I though we have a memory of the past, Bins- wanger would say that the primary emphasis i n the temporalization of D a sein i s o n i t s pitch toward the future.\" T hi s is sometimes called futurity and it r e f e rs to the fact that human beings always frame their upcoming simply shaped by what has gone before. We intend that certain things come about in our lives, and then m aneuver circumstances as best we can to attain our ends. Sometimes we are unable to maneuver or o therwise change things about an d h e n c e must direct our behavior according to what already exists or must be carried out. For ex- ample, we are born into this world with cer- tain physical equipment, into cultural envi- ronments with a l r e ady e stablished beliefs and laws. We c a nnot b ecome outstanding athletes if we lack the physical stature, and it hardly seems reasonable to object to every law now on th e b o oks in ou r s o ciety. The existentialists would say 'we are th r o wn b y such circumstances.\" Related to this concept of being under the constraints of our physical and cultural heritage is the concept of hi s - toricity \"B i n s w a n.ger would be more likely to use this concept, by which he would mean the world-designs and related assumptions that have been worked out and br ought to l ife by our ancestors. Our Dasein is in t h i s way continuous with the Dasein of our fore- bears. Historical precedents are thus one way of speaking about the thrownness of Dasein; there is a facticity about the history of a peo- ple which any one person born into the group must recognize and appreciate if he or she is to feel adjusted. We tend to call i n f luences from out of our p ast social norms or social values, but they are in f act simply the hi s- toricized aspect of our present Dasein. Dasein is at al l t i m e s a g e stalt totality. Boss said, \"There are myriads of ai P e rent modes of human relationships and patterns of behavior toward what is encountered, all of them constituting m a n' s o n e f u n d a m e ntal nature, i.e., his unique way of b e ing-in-the- world as the disclosing, luminating realm of w orld-openness.\" \" A s a t o t a l i t y t h e r e i s always the communal or social aspect to con- sider. Though we can speak of the in divid- ual's Dasein, we must not forget that an as- pect of \"being there\" is \"being with\" others.\" We are not cutting up existence into individ- u al private worlds when w e s p eak o f t h e Dasein. Binswanger condsidered the Dasein to be a gestalt total consisting of three differ- entiated aspects or \"worlds\" ( tuelts ): (I) eigenu elt, the self-world of inner feelings and affections, including all of t h ose experiences we think of as wi t h in ou r b o d i e s; An d re w feels love or anxiety in h i s e i g e nwelt; (2) urn+ el', the environment or world around us, including both animate and i n a n i mate fea- tures of existence; Andrew perceives trees and city streets with people walking along them in his umwelt; an d (3) mitarelt, the social world, the interpersonal world of p eople as psychological rather than physical beings, in- cluding all of t h ose things we mean by so- ciety; Andrew meets others, argues, fhrts, and feels an allegiance to causes in his mitwelt.\"' This last aspect of existence has been high- l ighted by Boss, who noted that \" the worl d of Dasein is essentially Mitchel't.\"\" W e l i v e primarily in r e l ation to o t he r p s ychological human beings. If our Dasein is to some extent thrown by the intentions of people in earlier times (as in our legal systems, and so on ), then it must be possible for us to project possibilities for fulFillment into our future and the future of others who come after us as well.

Th e e x i stentialists speak of c a r e (caring) when they discuss the willingness a person has to commit himself or h erself to change and growth by way of fulfill ing pos- sibilities.\" It ta kes courage to grow, for we must transcend the familiar and the accepted to put ourselves at ris ( in t he h e n c eforth (future ) of our life existence. Technically speaking, no formal construct of self has been proposed by the existentialists, even though the word per se is used descrip- tively as an ia'entity concept.\" Hence, we can for the purposes of discussion use the general term identity to refer jointly to that aspect of Dasein that other theories mean by references to the sel f, person, human being, I, Me, man, teoman, and so on. All of these words can be found in the writings of the existentialists as symbols of identity. In considering identity according to existentialism, we rriust also keep in mind the endowing versus disclosing dis- tinction which B i n swanger and B oss have drawn in their outlooks. Figure 26 presents a schematization of the Dasein and identity, as modified according to meaning-endowing or meaning-disclosing features of the Dasein. Point 1 of Figure 26 is a figure-on-ground arrangement, with the global figure labeled \"identity\" and the entire complex (of dark- ened global figure and dashed-line arrows ) labeled the \"Dasein.\" It is not unusual for the existentialists to speak of the self as a form of emergent (that is, figure ) on th e b ack- ground of the Dasein, so we begin w ith this tactic.\" Assume that we think of th e global- identity figure as Andrew, who confronts life daily by way of the three worlds of Dasein. Andrew cannot be passive in this confronta- tion. He must act, decide, and commit him- self to the facticity of his existence and to the necessity of fulfilling his possibilities if he is to live authentically. Point 2 in Figure 26 is a side view of the Dasein, with the identity portion arbitrarily pulled out away from the gestalt complex as a whole, stretching the fabric of Dasein with- o ut disturbing the totality of po in t 1 . O n c e again, the identity a s pect of D a s e in is n o t other than the Dasein. Andrew is always one Dasein and Identity Now that we have reviewed the nature of be- i ng and the g l obal view o f D a s ein w h i c h e xistentialists advocate, we mi gh t a s k , \"Is there a concept of self or personal identity which is used to explain personality>\" This question may be answered with both a no and a qualified yes. That is, strictly speaking, the existentialist, like any convinced phenomenol- ogist, is opposed to categorizing experience according to some a r bitrary p r econception (see pp. 755 — 758). To name a self in the per- sonality means we must speak about the self versus the environment, or the external world confronting the self. This structural split is not acceptable. Freud was thus taken to task b y the existentialists for having split up th e u nity of e x p erience into a n i d , e g o , a n d superego.\""},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"IDENTITY, SELF, I, ME, PERSON, MAN, HUMAN DASEI N MEANING MEAN I NG MEAN I NG-ENDOWI NG / l MEAN I NG-D I SCLQS I NG 3 4 g ( ( • gggaeam Figure 26 The Dasein and Identity Tezms"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 Existential Analysis or Daseinsanalysis: Binswanger and Boss 639 as a being-in-the-world.

In o t h e r w o r ds, w h ether w e want to say that Andrew's world-designs (as- sumptions ) endow Dasein with meaning or the Dasein discloses meaning to Andrew, the point to which meaning Rows or is anchored is the I, self, Me, or whatever term Andrew might use to describe his identity.

At point 3 w e can see the different em- phases placed on the role of meaning in the stretched Dasein (that is, assume we h ad t aken hold of th e i d e ntity as i f i t w e r e a marble in a liquid mass and simply pulled it away from the center without removing it from the total mass, which simply stretched ).

Andrew would be sending his assumptions o utward, finding a l w ays i n l i f e w h a t h i s frames of r e f erence meaningfully express. Boss, on the other hand, thought of the mean- ings of the Dasein as flowing inward toward Andrew. Thus we have labeled the arrows moving inward, toward identity as \"meaning- disclosing.\" Rather than seeing the person as projecting subjective inner perspectives onto the world, Boss argued that: \"... the 'essence' of a human being, as phenomenological in- vestigations of dream phenomena have shown time after time, is of quite a different kind: man 'ex-ists' in the very literal sense of the word.

One day, as she was skating, the heel on her shoe gave away, and inter- preting this as a collapse of her entire world, she fainted. She had relied too much on an either-or key-theme in wh ich a m o d erating ontological category — for example, of the un- expected or chance event — did not exist. The cause of the fainting was not some repressed and hence unconscious conflict or wish but the even more basic factor of a constricted Dasein. ness of Dasein.\" They make no a t tempt to reduce the m or e p s y chological aspects of Dasein to such elements, although occasion- ally the term en e rgy m a y b e u s e d in t h e sense of putting forth effort to achieve some end.\" Boss spoke of a p erson's mood, pas- sion, or affect as coloring his or her Dasein. This can alter a person's existence noticeably.

This creative ability is what dis- tinguishes the human being from the lower animal. Binswanger said, \"The tsubhuman ] animal has its environment by the grace of nature, not by the grace of freedom to tran- scend the situation.\"\" A p e r son, on the other hand, can be many things — a student, marital partner, business person, artist, and so on- all in one span of time or at v a r i ous times over his or her life.\" Indeed, we human beings are probably always more \"about to be\" some- thing we are not quite yet than we are any- thing fixed and \" g i v en.\" Boss reflected this emergent theme when he said, \"In reality, man exists always and only as the myriads of possibilities for relating to and disclosing the living beings and things he encounters.\"\"' If Dasein is thrown and assumes a pitch from time to time, how can we suggest that the human being is free to choose one man- ner of behavior over another> The existen- tialists have probably devoted more time to this question of freedom and choice than any other group of thinkers in modern times.

How does anxiety arise in the first place ~ Binswanger pointed out that part of being in a u orld is concerned with the likelihood that this world will f ad e i nto no t h i n g n ess. It is this basic loss of world that he calls existential anxiety. This form of anxiety is not an emo- tion, it is not felt in a heightened, tremulous s tate of terror w i t h p e r s p iring h a nd s a n d quaking voice. Binswanger once described a bland, soft-spoken client of few w o rds as \"a burned-out crater\" and added that this state was not a feeling or an affect: \"but an expres- sion of existential a n xiety, that i s , o f t h e draining of the existence, and of its progres- sive loss of 'world.' Of course, loss of world i s accompanied by loss of self. W h er e t h e existence is no longer in a position to design the world freely, it also suffers the loss of the self.\" \"' Existential anxiety is thus the reason why some people feel bored, empty, and void. Melanic does not seem to be suffering from anxiety, since she is constantly moping about, c omplaining about how b o re d sh e is . B u t Binswanger would say that sh e i s a c tually suffering from the \"nothingness of anxiety,\" which has petrified Melanic's Dasein, narrow- ing its horizons and n egating al l c h a n ces that she will be sensitive to the possibilities for growth in the future.\"' Recall that being and nothingness are related concepts. Hence, everyone is motivated to enrich Dasein and thereby avoid the nothingness of existential anxiety. The other form of anxiety, which is neu- rotic in tone, is also likely to be experienced by all of us from time to time, but it is more an unpleasant sensation we usually identify a s feeling uptight, j u m py , s h a ky , an d s o E xistential versus ¹ u r o t i c F o r m s of Anxiety and Guilt Though the last section ends on a positive note, the truth is that not all people opt for freedom or try to transcend their current cir- cumstances to achieve a f u t ur e p o ssibility.

In s p eaking a b ou t w h y p o s s i bilities are or are not achieved or furthered by the individual, Binswanger and Boss emphasized the concepts of anxiety an d g u i l t , r e s pec- tively, even though at a certain level, these constructs seem identical. Binswanger thus d i stinguished between what he called existential anxiety and what we may term ne urotic anxiety. All a n x i e ty stems from difficulties in the world (mitwelt, umwelt, eigenwelt ) as experienced by the in- dividual.'\" Rosa is flooded with a n x iety at the prospect of having now to actually take charge of her life, to leave her parental home, find a job, and seek her own circle of friends. Her world seems to have disintegrated as she now faces the prospects of living authentically for the first time in her l i fe. T hi s authentic living is still merely a possibility. Whether it will be actualized remains to be seen. The existentialists note that anxiety often begins with a feeling of uncanniness, such as when things begin happening that seem unfamiliar to our previous experience.\"' Something un- natural or weird is taking place, but we are in the dark about why this is happening.

If one aspect of their world does not go well, they can move on to another for they have alternatives at hand. The constricted person, however, like the young woman who fainted while skating, must surely sense a loss of world (that is, anxiety ) more readily. Although Boss referred to anxiety as a mood, or the pitch of Dasein, he developed the themes we are now considering under the construct of guilt.\"' T h a t is, we can dis- tinguish between an existentiaL gniLt and a neurotic guilt on a l m o st the same grounds that we have distinguished between these two forms of anxiety. By existential guilt, Boss meant a primary or basic debt the person has, to carry out possibilities in existence that keep presenting themselves and that would allow the person to further his or her potentials, en- rich life in some way, improve things, and so on.\"' If we t h in k of al l of t h ose things that need doing in l i fe, that have to be accom- plished in order for Dasein to be enlarged and enriched in meaning-openness, then we must surely recognize that all human beings sense a basic indebtedness to their future. We feel a sense of responsibility for our f u t u res be- cause that is where we are always creating ourselves. Think of all those things we know — deep in our hearts — that we should have done or could have done in our past lives that would have enriched our e x istence today! And in the present, we know that with every act, with every choice we make, we must of necessity close out o t her p o ssibilities that might be open to creation if we had chosen them instead of the alternative we opted for. This too puts us behind the flow o f e v ents as we ponder \"Have I done the right thing>\" For this reason, Boss viewed the human being's basic life situation as being one of guilt. If being and nothingness are two in - evitable aspects of existence, then being and guilt are also necessary aspects. And here we can speak of the conscience in existentialism. \" Man is aware of existential guilt w hen h e hears the never-ending call of his conscience. T his essential, inevitable b e i n g-in-debt i s guilt, and not merely a subjective feeLing of guilt.\" \"' As existential anxiety is not simply an emotion, existential guilt is not simply a feeling. We are down to th e b a sics of exis- tence here. Neurotic guilt, on the other hand, is a form of derived guilt in w h ich the indi- vidual has suffered the misfortune of having b een reared in a given environment.\"' T h i s is the result of historical accident, an unlucky development which might have been other- wise in this person s life. But existential guilt is something we all mu st experience as we commit ourselves to the possibilities of our Dasein, and woe to the psychotherapist who fails to distinguish between these two funda- m entally different m a n ifestations of g u i l t . Neurotic guilt can sharpen and worsen exis- tential guilt, but the reverse is not true. Psychodynamics and the Adjustment Mechanisms lf Dasein cannot be split into conscious and unconscious regions or into the subdivisions of ids, egos, or superegos, then surely it can- not be made into a past which now psycho- dynarnically influences the pr e s ent.\"' F o r Boss, defense meant that the individual is un- willing to become aware of a certain world- r elationship which i s u n d e r l u m i n a t i on .\" \""},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Part III 644 Kan tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook T he more A l v i n t r i e s t o d e f e n d h i m s e l f against the lumination in his Dasein that he is relating to others in a childish, dependent manner, the more certain it is that he will go on acting in this fashion. He r eally cannot escape this behavioral pattern no matter how much he looks past the lumination which is there for the seeing if he but looks. We can- not hide the real character of our behavior from its world-openness. The theories o f F r e u d i a n a d j u s t m ent mechanisms all presuppose some arbitrarily reductive, divisive breakdown of e x i stence. Take, for example, Freud's concept of intro jection. Boss saw an entirely diBerent phe- nomenon here. \"Wherever so-called intro- jection is observed, nothing has been takenin. On the contrary, a human existence has not yet taken itself oui of and f r eed itself from the original being-together undividedly and undiscriminatingly wit h s o mebody else.\"\"' Freud seemed incapable of looking directly at the phenomenal reality of experience to de- scribe what was luminated directly. Rather than our c a l l in g s o mething re p ressed, we would be more accurate if we said that an aspect of existence is unable to become en- gaged in an open, free, authentic, world- disclosing relationship.\"' A p e r son does not project into Dasein, but finds there what ex- perience means as he or she luminates exis- tence.\"' Who is to say that a subject's Dasein is a projection of something else> Although Binswanger agreed with Boss in this general matter of defense and so-called m echanisms of a d j ustment, he w a s m o r e likely to use language that smacked of these meanings — often in an i n f o r mal sense and occasionally with apologies.\"' So-called de- fenses are merely one way of speaking about world-designs. For example, if a person en- dows Dasein with the meanings of solid cer- tainty versus holes of uncertainty, then he or she might well take in meaningful p atterns from others in order to fill th e areas (holes) of phenomenal uncertainty.'\" Such fill ing-in or taking-in can be t e r med in t r o jection o r identi ication f o r a p r a c tical c l i n i cal p u r - pose.'\" But we must never forget that it takes a more basic assumption (a priori structure ) to be in operation before the defense mech- anism is possible. Binswanger made informal references in his writ ings to r e g ression, re- pression, and progression, each of which were interpreted diRerently from Freud.'\" H e had rather severe reservations concerning sublima tion, however, since it i m p l i e s t h at s o m e - t hing higher l i t erally comes ou t o f s o m e - thing lower — and this is essentially the reverse form of the reductive explanation that exis- tentialism has found unsuitable.'\" One genuine mechanism (in the sense of a stylized behavioral tactic ) can be laid at the f eet of the existentialists, and that i s w h a t might be termed irusti ng to fate. To 'believe that fate will somehow enter into one's exis- tence and decide alternatives for one is an escapist device that many people use.'\" Such individuals relieve themselves of existential anxiety by saying, \"Oh well, no need to feel guilty or worry about how thi ngs are going. It was my destiny to be here and you can' t argue with your fate.\" Time-Perspective Constructs Dasein's Historica/ Development The existentialists have not worked out a de- t ailed scheme for the description of h u m a n development. Their feeling is that Freud and o thers stressed development based on b i o - l ogical assumptions,\"' w h ich c a lls fo r s u ch notions as growth, physical stages of matura- tion, and so on.

Even though this originates in the relationship with mother (mitwelt ), the child begins to separate himself or h e rself (eigenwelt ) from the rest of w o rl d t h a t i s not self (umwelt ) by stopping the ingestion (sucking) of milk. If th e r elationship in the mitwelt- (with mother ) does not i m p r ove, the child can become seriously ill and, even following treatment, can retain an unnatural splitting up of D a sein into w o r ld s that fail to influence each other with ease. The more normal developmental progression is for the eigenwelt, umwelt, and mitw elt t o act as a totality and maintain an o p e n ness to each other as the child learns about these three aspects of existence over the years. The Tas( of Life If there is a central theme i n t h e e x i sten- tialist's view of what life development is all about, it is that we as individuals must ad- vance on life actively and assume the respon- sibility of meeting our possibilities to enrich and extend Dasein. Each of us m ust attain indepena'ence from the thrownness of rigid nature, paternal direction, and those related social forces that take decision and choice out of our hands. The major life theme and chal- lenge of existence is thus dependence ind'e pendence. Though they r e f e rred to s t a g e s merely informally,\"' ample evidence suggests that a mature-versus-immature existential life pattern\"' was being used by both Boss and Binswanger in their assessment of life's devel- opmental aspects. Boss reflected this attitude when he observed that \"... the child's world must die and give way to ever more grown- up ways of behavior.\" \"' Major shifts in the nature of Dasein take place at important points in life. Probably the first and most general change in Dasein oc- curs during that period w he n l a n g u age is being learned. The very concept of phenom- ena in existentialism rests upon l a n g uage capacity, for as B i n swanger ha s o b served, \" . .. it is in language that our world-designs actually ensconce I settle into ] and articulate Iclarify] themselves... .\" '\" Of course, many thrown aspects of Dasein are already given in t he language structure which t h e c h i l d i s"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"646 Ka n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook Part II I taught.

Identity problems are quite common during adolescence, and it wa s i n t h i s s e nse that Binswanger was likely to use the term iden tification to say that a meaning relation to peers is cemented during the teen-age years.\"' This gradual shift from f a m ily t o c o m plete independence is furthered over adolescence u ntil adulthood. Adolescents have by n o w elaborated their world-designs and luminated existence in their own subjective fashion. So- The Role of Religion Binswanger and Freud had one of their most fundamental disagreements over the human beings religious inclinations. Freud thought of religion as an adult type of d ependency. People were trying to extend their paternal affections into a cosmic principle — a father in the sky. Binswanger argued that this seemed to be another one of t h ose r e ductions that F reud was so fond of, r e ducing one t h i n g (religion ) to another (paternal fixation ) . Binswanger tells us of his retort to Freud. . . . I found myself forced to recognize in man something li (e a basic religious cate- gory; that, in any case, it tvas impossible for me to admit that \"the religious\" tv as a phe- nomenon that could' somehow be derived from something else.

This is called a stucg Dasein, in the sense that it is n ot moving f o r w ar d t o m a t u r e p r o p e r l y, which in turn amounts to a constriction. The Freudian Oedipal conflict is viewed as an irn- mature pattern of a stuck Dasein, in whi ch extreme dependency on a parent is the major f eature.\"' Th e e x i stentialists do no t a g r e e with the sexual interpretations of Freud. Sex is a possibility which arises at one point in life, and by adulthood a well-adjusted person has usually affirmed this choice and acquired a sexual partner. However, if an adult were to opt for a l i f e o f r e l i g i ou s celibacy, this would not necessarily mean the person had taken an abnormal course.\"' F r eu d g r eatly simplified things in his overly sexualized ac- counts of behavior.

Psychopathology and Psychotherapy Theory of Illness Constricted Dasei n The personality system that advances on life with only a fe w a p r i o r i o n t o l o gical struc- tures is most vulnerable to ab n ormality.\"' Dwight has grown up t h i n k ing t ha t p eople are either good or bad, and that one either succeeds perfectly in what on e a t t empts or fails completely. Given this set of life assump- tions, it is no wonder that D w i gh t e nds up one day feeling paranoid, that he experiences p eople as evil and desirous of making h i m suRer miserably. With only one or two world- d esigns to fall back on, our wo rl d m ust i n - evitably shrink. The more constricted it be- comes, the more likely it is t hat a s i tuation will arise that cannot be understood — lead- ing in turn to that sense of uncanniness that signals the onset of anxiety (refer above ). In a sense, a person with limited world-designs suffers an u n freedom to a c t, b e c a use not enough alternatives are open to him or her.\"' Dwight's problems stem from wanting things to be too perfect in life, and this is a frequent c ause of difficulty for p e ople. W e t en d t o idealize things in our Dasein, confusing what ought to be in life with whatis. This is an ex- ample of finding the eigenwelt (self beliefs ) Individual-Differences Constructs Since the existentialists are particularly sensi- tive to the alienating possibilities of theories that supposedly capture why Dasein is as it is, they naturally are reluctant to name a host of theorotypes. What one means by types, such as anal, oral, and so forth, is that a given and restricted world-design has taken hold of an individual.'\" A n a l i ty, fo r e x ample, may be true of miserly people, compulsive people, and so forth. This world-design is probably one of viewing the world as a hole, to be filled up.\"' This filling premise makes possible the eventual clinical picture of anality, since the f ormer pr eoccupation f r a me s an d h e n c e shapes the latter. Subsequent fillings m ay also take place, and we may call the person a compulsive hoarder of m o n ey, affection, ideas, and so forth. Of course, in order to apply their theories to all people, the existentialists have to gen- eralize their concepts. We have already seen how they speak about what is essentially a de- pendent-versus-independent Dasein p a t tern in the growing c h i ld . T h e y a lso speak of t radition-hound people who are t h r own b y the attitudes and beliefs of the i n a uthentic everybody rather than living by the authentic v iews peculiar to t h emselves.\"' W e might therefore accuse the existentialists of doing precisely what they find o b j ectionable in Freudian theory.

Former friends a nd associates describe him as a v er y d i s - turbed, highly immature, and resentful hu- man being. He does not know quite what to make of himself, but feels certain his prob- lems are due to other people and not himself. individual s own actions. Dwight is the cause of his own difficulties, for, as Boss has ob- served: \"... in the strict sense of the term, no event in the life history of a person can ever be the 'cause' of neurotic symptoms. Per- sonal experiences merely initiate inhibitions against fully carrying out al l p o ssible inter- personal and interworldly r e l ationships.\" '\" This attitude places the major responsibil- ity on Dwight's shoulders to move beyond the difjiculties of his environment, where because o f a harshly demanding parent, he m i g h t have indeed felt that things were either per- fect or totally unworthy. But as he came to find other people having other points of view, he was not forced in any necessary way to go on limiting his Dasein to the characteriza- tions of his parent. By constantly focusing on his past and blaming his parent for the lat- ter's overprotectiveness and unrealistic stan- d ards, all D w i gh t a c c omplishes is f u r t h er constriction, because his problem is not in the past but in the present and the future. Dwight has never been willing to commit hi mself to authentic living b y fi r s t a c c e pting r e spon- sibility for remaining where he is now at in life. For this reason the existentialists would describe Dwight as living — like all abnormal individuals — in a state of selj chosen un f-ree dom.'\" The point of growing up is that we must learn to t r a nscend, wh ich i n c l u des r i s ing above the difficult experiences of life, and to carry out our potentials by authentically com- mitting ourselves to the new avenues the fu- ture opens up. Some people have more diffi- cult times than others, but if we cl i n i c a lly examine the life histories of abnormals, we often find that they have permitted minor life setbacks to defeat them. It is th e subjective i nterpretation of s e t b acks t ha t c o u n t s , o f course.\"' Dw i g h t's serious problems began the first day of hi s h ig h s chool attendance when he tried to have a course changed but was denied.

When things go wrong for a long period of time, an abnormal person may re- ject the mitwelt i n p r e f erence to a f a n tasy life, but at least in the beginning, the abnor- mal adjustment accepts direction from others only too willingly.

Boss once analyzed a nine-year-old boy who was terrified of p o l ice dogs and con- cluded that the boy \"could not achieve a free relationship to his own impulsive and sensual possibilities of relating, nor to the realms of being which show themselves in the light of these possibilities.\" \"' Binswanger has noted that many abnor- mals vary the fixing-on-fate defensive maneu- ver by projecting a certain amount of in au- thentic futurity. Thus, through emphasis on superstition, luck, and magic, the immature person hopes to oRset doom by performing some rite, saying certain words, carrying a potent charm, and so forth. Normal manifes- t ations include knocking o n w o o d o r b e - lieving in lucky numbers or rabbit's feet, but an overreliance on such devices suggests that an existential u easiness has developed. \"By existential weakness we mean that a person d oes not stand autonomously in his w o r l d , that he blocks himself off from th e g r ound of his existence, that he does not take his exis- tence upon himself but trusts himself to alien powers, that he makes alien powers 'respon- s ible' for his fate instead of himself.\" \"' T h e various forms of mental illness are thus ex- tensions of a tendency to surrender the self to others, to circumstance, to a world-design that limits authentic growth. Di fi'erential Diagnosis S ince the existentialists are critical of t h e classic medical model of disease as reductive, they are reluctant to diagnose their patients i n the style of this m odel.\"' O n t h e o t h e r hand, they do no t d en y th e l e g i t i macy of clinical pictures and over the years they have offered a number of explanations of the so- called clinical e n t i t i es.'\" Sy m p t o m s a r e v iewed as f o rm s o f c o m m u n i c a t ion, a n - nouncing the existential problem in which the person feels himself or h e r s elf t r a p ped.'\" Often the symptom is just as much a possi- bility as is any other form of behavior.

T h e symptom often conceals a world-relation the individual does not wish to be open about.\"' Dwight's hostility toward his harshly domi- n ating parent comes through a s a s e v e r e stammer which he displays each time he must speak to his parent. In the final analysis, said Boss, the diagnostic picture always emerges in a social context. \" . .. No psychopathologi- cal symptom will ever be fully and adequately understood unless it is conceived of as a dis- turbance in the texture of the social relation- ships of which a given human existence fun- damentally consists, and that all p sychiatric diagnoses are basically only sociological state- ments.\" '\" The existentialists view neurosis as an in- creasingly serious constriction of Dasein with the accordingly self-surrender of a u tonomy and independence.

Thus, a figure appears to tell the psychotic what to do and t o p ass judg- ment on these actions once they are carried out. The self-surrender of abnormality comes back in this literal form with a vengeance. To further r o un d ou t t h e p i c t u re, p s y- chotics usually concoct some kind of d e l u - sional system. Here again, though false from our vantage point, these belief systems must be considered as genuine aspects of the Dasein within which the psychotic is living. Binswan- ger suggested that a delusion — especially of persecution — is always lurking somewhere in the psychotic state. Because of this central dynamic of feeling persecuted, the psychotic inevitably comes to hate those whom he or she considers to be enemies.'\" T h ere is al - ways a good deal of hatred in psychosis, and by so directing hatred to others, the psychotic individual can take the spotlight oR his or her p ersonal responsibility. Indeed, this is h o w self-identity is eventually lost i n p s y chosis, As Binswanger noted: \"Where there is delu- sion there can no longer be any genuine self. To speak of a ' d elusional self' would be a contradiction.. . . \" \" ' I n t i m e , t h e p sychotic loses all sense of distinction between inside and outside, between what he or she is as a self-identity in existence and what the world is as another aspect of that existence.\"' When t his occurs, th e p s y chotic i n d i v i d ual h a s slipped completely into a thrown state. Neu- rotic anxiety is compounded by e x istential anxiety, and the future is bleak indeed. We will next examine some of the classic clinical syndromes which the existentialists have mentioned in order to i l l u s trate their approach to diagnosis. ulcer. Ulcer cases. The world-relation typical of an ulcer patient emphasizes seizing, overpower- ing, and taking p ossession of the e n viron- ment, so that everything is robbed of its in- dividuality.'\" Th e c o nsiderable concealment of this demolishing pattern among ulcer pa- person may appear to be unaggressive, even passive, but the somatic (bodily) realm be- haves in the style that typifies the Dasein's true structure. Food is grasped, cut up by the teeth, and plunged into the stomach and in- testine, where it is literally demolished by an overabundance of motility, hydrochloric (di- gestive ) acid, pepsin, and the enzymes of the p ancreas.\"' As a b y -product of t h i s w o r l d - disclosing pattern, the symptoms indica te the actual intestinal damage known as a peptic t ients renders its manifestation inward.

She then coughs softly and looks at her husband as a child looks at a parent. It is far more obvious in hysteria than in almost any other disorder t hat the patient i n m a k i n g p h y s i cal co m- plaints is seeking to be cared for. Usually we find, as in the case of Valerie and her hus- band, that the hysterical patient has formed an almost organic bond with another person — usually a parental substitute. Symptoms tend to be dramatic, including various trem- ors, limp extremities, even blindness.

Phobia Ph .obias (unnatural fears ) guard against an individual s losing hold of his or her world completely. As long as Luke can focus his anxiety on dirt, he can at least keep a certain order in h i s l i f e a s h e p l an s h i s r outine and m a n e uvers th r ough th e d a y , making certain he stays clear of filthy things and the germs he presumes they carry. With- out this phobic concern, Luke's world would reveal its nothingness and precipitate in turn a really traumatic existential predicament.\"' Luke also uses various magical rituals and lucky charms to keep his world in o r d er, a not infrequent accompaniment of the phobic symptom. Sexua/ Abnormality. In m o s t i n s t a n c es, a person with a sexual abnormality is finding it difficult to affirm an d m ak e r eal th e p ossi- bilities that Dasein is luminating in the sexual sphere.\"' The p eeper cannot participate in sex but wants desperately to observe acts of sexual copulation. It is relatively safe to ob- serve from afar, even though a threat is posed by the fact that a law is being broken in tres- p assing and wi n dow p e eping. Th e h o m o - sexual cannot give himself or herself to an opposite-sex partner; the essence of this pat- batory sexual activity by entering into a sarne- s ex relationship. In e v er y i n s t ance of a n abnormal sexual tendency, we can find a time in development when the afHicted person did not accept the responsibility of committin g himself or herself to possibilities a maturing physical status had brought. Obsessi ve Com pulsive Neurosis -Obsessive. individuals invariably h av e w o r l d - designs t hat are highly i n t e llectualized.\"' T h a t i s , e verything is expected to fall into line w i t h pure, conceptual thought. Life is like a huge conceptual puzzle that does not require emo- tional commitment so much as accurate, logi- cal thinking. The strategy here is clear, for the obsessive-compulsive person finds in this world-design a kind of defense against having t o form close interpersonal ties in the m i t - welt. People can be dealt with on an affect- less plane, as if they were logical machines. The existentialists do not deny the Freudian anality tie-in to this syndrome, but they see in this relation a f ear d e veloping of o ne' s c reature, emotive, n o n i ntellectual si de. I n other words, anal tendencies of neatness and precision develop because the person is deny- ing his or her basic humanness. Just as logical machines do not produce organic waste nor invite disorder, so too the obsessive-compul- sive individual likes to have a life free of hu- man frailty, including fecal matter, filth, or disorder of any variety. Fearing to be quite that human, the person denies possibilities and approaches life in a more idealistic, super- human, intellectual vein.

The manic- depressive person seems to be on the verge of finding a p e r spective, a w o r l d -design that would put hi s o r h e r e x i stence into order. There are periods of clarity, and yet in each period, there seems to be another alternative suggested, so that the manic-depressive seems a lways to be moving between two w o r l d s. And there are mood changes accompanying these shifts, so that we see euphoria (elation ) on the one hand and m e l ancholy (depres- sion ) on the other. The melancholy seems to come on when things projected in a state of euphoria do not work out as expected; these possibilities are not realized because in fact the person is being thrown. At t i mes of fail- ure, the manic-depressive person is likely to blame others for hi s o r h e r f r u s t r ations.'\" Not infrequently, those receiving the blame are the very ones who direct the abnormal person's life, but what is required is not re- crimination or fault-finding. The m a nic de- pressive must. begin l i v i n g a u t h e n t i cally. When he or she cannot do so, there are often s evere guilt feelings, sometimes taking t h e form of self-destructive tendencies (suicide attempts, and so on ).\"' Suicide, however, is another of those avoidant behaviors wherein, rather than solving life problems, the person is defeated most finally by them.

If we now confuse this form of guilt with guilt over something far removed from th e existential predicament of the present — a Fixation or un- resolved Oedipal c o m p lex — we eRectively teach the client that he or she should not be feeling this guilt. It is removed from the on- going present and cannot be relevant to what is now taking place. The existentialists feel that the Freudians arbitrarily decide on which of the phenomenal experiences to take seri- ously in this fashion, distorting the client s Dasein in th e p r o cess. Existential analysts t ake al/ phenomenal experience at its f a ce value, seeking the meaning for present exis- tence of all moods and emotions. As clients begin to respond to their feel- i ngs, see possibilities in t h ei r f u t u r e , a n d make attempts to achieve these possibilities, they steadily increase their independence and sense of well-being in lifestyle.

If th e t h e r apist ac- cepts the role of a parent and somehow — pos- s ibly through distortions in his or he r o w n D asein — encourages such a pattern i n t h e client-relationship, the therapist is sure to gen- erate hostility in the client. This is what the F reudians have done, although t h e y m i s - t akenly interpret this natural irr itation wi t h their method of relating to the client as nega tive trans ference.\"' B oss observed that if a m a l e a n a l yst i s aware of the childlike nature of th e f emale neurotic's Dasein, he will never confuse the e rotic demands she m a kes o n h i m w i t h \"grown-up sexuality.\"\"' H e w i l l a p p r e ciate t hat these demands arise fro m a c h i l d l i k e longing to be loved and cared for as a small daughter. The therapist must appreciate that in psychotherapy clients have to at some point live out or \"act out\" those world-designs that are ever active in their Dasein. The existential analyst makes these known through proper interpretations and thereby encourages the client to begin advancing on life t h r ough a more appropriate w o r l d -design — which is worked out through phenomenal self-study. The therapist might say to a female client at some point, \"You seem to express your love to me as if I were your father. Have you ever thought about this> Are there times, for ex- ample, when you can love other p eople in some other way than a daughter-father way t\" T he client naturally fi nd s i t d i f fi c ul t t o make this phenomenal study and often feels a certain degree of resentment in being en- couraged to do so. Some clients are literally terrified by the threat of having to face their Dasein openly, and at this point we are likely to see signs of resistance.'\" It is here that the therapist must demonstrate his or her greatest Relationship, Trans ference, and' Resistance The existentialists believe that an essential ingredient in therapy is the sense of trust a patient has in his or her relationship with the therapist. Binswanger spoke of the therapist as \"the post to which existence clings while adrift in the whirlpool, from whom it expects aid and protection as a sign that some inter- h uman relationship is still possible.\"\"' T h e severely disturbed person needs to be rescued by someone else.\"' B oss em phasized that these are genuine relationships between two human beings, and any love expressed by the client for the analyst is therefore \"love of the analyst himself, no matter how immature and distorted it may appear because of the limita- tions of perception imposed on the patient by his earlier relationship to his real father.\"\" ' In other words, existential analysis would not want to detract from the present situation by r educing it t o t h e p a s t e x p erience of t h e client. The existential analyst is at all times kind and reassuring, respectful of all that emerges from a client's Dasein, and above all, permis sive in the relationship.\"' Of course, this per- missiveness does not mean that the existential analyst is passive, allowing the client to direct therapy entirely to his or her whim. Permis- siveness encourages clients to be open, so that now, for possibly the first time in their lives, they can live out their true being in relation to their therapists. The existentialists accept the clinical facts of trans ference and resistance, but they inter- pret them differently from the Freudians.

The therapist en- courages the client to begin in a small way, looking openly at first at the luminations of Dasein. As more confidence is achieved in this vein, the therapist can help th e c l i ent set modest goals for actualizing those possibili- ties that have a high probability of being re- a lized outside the consulting room i n l i f e proper. The existential analyst is completely committed to the client, even to the extent of going to the latter's home during t i mes of crises to provide support an d e n c o urage- ment.\"' A c l a ssical Freudian analyst would never do this, feeling that this would suggest countertransference on the part of the thera- pist. In fact, many c r i t ics of D a s einsanalysis charge that the approach formalizes counter- transference into a technique of therapy. Boss rejected this criticism and observed that a decided healing agent i n t h e r e l a t i onship must necessarily be what he called psycho- therapeutic eros. This is not like a ny o ther love relationship in h u man experience, not like a parental, romantic, friendship, or even a religious love for others.

In the strict sense, existentialistic thera- pists do not like to use doctrinaire techiques, because they fear these stylized steps of how to do therapy may alienate the client from his or her true phenomenological experience.\"' For example, the methods of free association (Freud) or amplif ication (Jung) tend to take the client away from what i s i m m e diate or current in the Dasein to some other or earlier locus of concern, which is then said to be the important or real cause of the pr oblems in living.

If the patient prefers, he or s he may lie down, but t hi s p o sition is n o t essential.\"' Existentialists follow most of the customary procedures of classical analysis; the therapist generally listens silently and tries to enter into the m e a ning-disclosing relation- ship of the client.\"' F ree association may be used but never in a rigidly doctrinaire fash- i on.

The point of thei nterpretatian is to clarify a world-design, although it may be some time before such insights are possible.

Furthermore, the so-called deep interpretation is not likely to be made by an existentialist therapist, because he or she sees these depth eRorts as reductive attempts. Hence, the interpretations are prob- ably more at the level of common sense. A good example of Boss's interpretation, made to a female patient and bearing content that a classical analyst would consider Oedipal, is as follows: Perhaps those feelings totvard me that came over you, and that you had for your father in t hat dream, and your u i s h t o h a v e p r e t t y clothes and to be attractive, are still far too big and unmanageable for you.

There is no in t r icate superstructure of per- sonality theory here to bring into an interpre- tation. We ar e c o n c erned as e x i stentialists with the person's ever-present world, hence interpretations are made in terms of the pres- ent life setting. There is also a form of chal- lenge put to the client to begin meeting the p ossibilities revealed in th e D a sein.\"' B o s s observed: \"The Daseinsanalyst often asks his patients, 'Why not >' th ereby encouraging them to ever greater tests of daring. 'Why is it that you don't dare to behave in such-and- such a manner during the analytic session >' is a question which is often asked in place of the usual analytic 'Why.~' \" \"' Of c o urse, we should not put the \"why n ot\" q u e stion to a client too early in the analysis, for this would p lace undue pressure on him or he r t o a c t . But it is apparent that given the great com- m itment they h ave t o t h e c l i e n t a n d t h e g entle pressure they are wi l l in g t o p u t o n their clients, the existential analysts take a highly active role in therapy. Dream Interpretation The existentialists make use of dream inter- pretation, and in fact, Boss wrote two books (1958, 1977) on the t o p ic. C onsistent with their broader view, the dream is seen as a le- gitimate aspect of Dasein. Binswanger viewed it as somehow entangled in the eigenwelt, re- f lecting a certain amount of c o n f u s ion an d self-forgetfulness there.\"' In ou r d r e ams we m ean to act, but seem immobilized by t h e passing of visual events.\"' Binswanger added, \"To dream means: I don't know what is hap- pening to me.\" \"' B oss was critical of Bins- w anger on this p o int, f eeling t ha t h e w a s diRerentiating unnecessarily between wake- fulness and dreaming, and that he assigned much too passive a role to th e d r e amer.\"' Boss emphasized the totality of Dasein when he said, \"Waking and dreaming, as but two diRerent modes of carrying to fulfillment the one and same historical human existence, be- long fundamentally together in that one ex- istence.\" \"' When we are awake, our Dasein p resents itself as more alert, bu t o t h e r w i s e there is no basic diRerence between being asleep and dreaming and being awake.'\" Boss emphasized that \"we have no dreams; we are o ur dreaming state.... \" \" The dream"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 Existential Analysis or Daseinsanalysis: Binswanger and Boss 657 state is a co m pletely subjective experience which can, for example, present us with new perspectives on the experience of time and space.\"' Events change rapidly, and we move backward and forward in time; there are dis- tortions, but this does not make the dream a product of some unreal other world (Dasein ). Our waking and d r eaming w o r lds are op- p osite sides of the same coin.'\" W e d o n o t take dream contents and call them symbols of something else. We take them in the phe- nomenal reality at their own level and then explore the meaning as expressed for the in- dividual tvith that in d i v idual.'\" B o ss called this unbiased study of p h e n omenal reality phenomenologi cal observation.'\" For example, assume that Ivan comes to us for therapy and that in th e course of treat- ment he tells of a dream in which his teeth are being removed or o t h e r wise tampered with. Boss noted that Freud would have con- sidered such a dream to be involved with mas- turbation — as the wish to m a sturbate, guilt o ver masturbating, o r w h a t e v er .\" ' W h y would Freud think that teeth somehow sym- bolized masturbation> Because in the slang Viennese dialect of his time, to \"rip one out\" (as a tooth ) referred to onanism (penis re- moved before ejaculation during intercourse ) o r to m a s t u rbation.'\" B o s s s h o w e d h o w Freud's interpretation completely overlooked t he fact that teeth actually serve us in t h e realm of seizing, gripping, capturing, assimi- lating, and gaining power over things. The e xistentialistic therapist would n e ver l i m i t himself or herself to the single and clearly arbi- trary symbolic interpretation of the Freudian analyst. To be fair to the Freudians, we are not entirely certain an analyst would be this routine i n m a k i n g i n t e r p r e tations t o day, either. But Boss was addressing Freud's writ- i ngs, and his m ai n p o i n t w a s t h a t w h e n something appears in a d r e am, w e s h ould consider it more openly than he felt F r eud did. Freud seemed to Boss to have been more interested in advancing a theory than in ob- serving and capturing the phenomenal truth. Boss distinguished between objective and subjective dream interpretation.'\" F r eud ap- proached the dream objectively, hoping to iso- late a theme common to all dreamers. Hence, if Ivan went on from his teeth dreams to dream that he was plowing a fi eld, Fr eud's sexual bias would suggest ipso facto that the plow w as really a penis and the furrow i t p a r t ed w as really a vagina.'\" O n c e a g a in, F r e u d would be overlooking relevant alternative in- terpretations, such as that it m i g h t r e flect a p rompting to p ic k u p l i f e again, to forge ahead and break new ground by meeting re- sponsibilities and affirming p o ssibilities, no matter how much effort mi ght be r equired. Boss said that dr e am i n t e r p r e t a ti'on co mes down to two main questions.\"' Fi r st, to what phenomenon is th e p e r s on's D a sein suffi- c iently open, so that it s h i nes f orth i n t h e dreaming state > Second, upon a w akening, can the person recognize features in existence that are identical in essence with the dream phenomena> In drawing the latter parallels, Boss referred to this as explication.\"' T o e x - plicate is thus to enlarge on the meanings of d reams, relating them t o t h e D a s e i n a s a w hole — including the w a k in g s t a te.

For example, a person m ight dream that h e o r s h e w a s a t h i n g , rather than a person. This would suggest ex- istentially that the person was being made aware of a certain inability to act or commit i n the wa k in g s t ate.\"' T h e d r e a m w o u l d suggest that the person was an i n a n imate, inert something rather than a human being. The terror dreams of children often involve wild animals or strange creatures. We can view these existentially as fearful reactions to certain newly discovered sensuous or hos- tile possibilities that the child is just becoming aware of. As such, the strange creatures do not symbolize anything needing covering up. The creatures rather capture precisely what is going on in the conscious aspect of Dasein. A man dreams that he sees his brother lying d ead in a casket, having been ki l led i n a traffic accident. Boss would interpret this not as a covert (hidden) death wish for a sibling but as the projected softer, loving side of life, a side this man had been turning his back on in his egotistical devotion to business mat- t ers.\"' The dream is telling him t ha t h e i s killing oB his humane side in the vain pur- suit of material wealth. Note the uncomplicated approach to dream interpretation here. There is no claim made of a dream censor, distorting what is into wh at is not.\"' Dreams merely supplement the rest of our experience. In a true sense, they alert u s to possibilities developing in life.\" ' T h i s is where their use in therapy is particularly relevant. We can, as e x istential therapists, base our \"why not~\" questions to the client on material and b ehavioral directions sug- gested by dreams. The person's childishness can be brought out in a dream,\"' but also the person's better side can be suggested in the dream content.\"' B y d i s cussing the dream content and drawing implications therefrom, existential analysts can usually find something vitally meaningful to their clients from which to begin a new approach on life. Chapter 10 begins with a survey of the major themes that have issued from the philosophy of existentialism: alienation, authenticity, sub- ject versus object, commitment, action, anx- iety, dread, despair, and absurdity. Philoso- phers who have been important in this school of thought include Ki erkegaard, Nietzsche, Jaspers, Heidegger, Sartre, and Marcel. In re- cent times, the themes of existentialism have been paralleled with similar concepts in Ori- ental philosophy, and Chapter 10 reviews in broad outline the essentials of this Eastern outlook. Beginning in ancient Hinduism and extending into B u d dhism — particularly Zen B uddhism — these concepts of living in un i t y with nature have enjoyed great popularity along with existentialism. It would not be in- c orrect to say that th e second half o f t h e twentieth century has been an age of existen- t ialism, providing t hat w e u n d e r stand t h e parallels across Western and Eastern philoso- phies. The two personologists discussed in Chap- t er 10 — Boss and Binswanger h av e b o t h drawn from the writings of Heidegger. Their a pproach is based on a study o f b e i ng , o r as it is called, ontology. The German word Dasein has the meaning of \" b e i n g t h e r e ,\" hence analysis of i m m ediate experience is w hat Daseinsanalysis attempts to do. E x i s - tential analysis (Daseinsanalysis ) focuses on the phenomenal experience of a person as it is i mmediatel y experienced.

Boss, on the other"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Chapter 10 Existential Analysis or Daseinsanalysis: Binswanger and Boss 659 hand, emphasized the meaning disclosed to the human being by existence, as if it were not so much how we l oo k a t e x i stence that matters but how e x i stence luminates or re- veals itself to us. Binswanger viewed the person as bringing to bear certain a priori ontological structures, or world-designs, which function at the phe- nomenal level and make experience what it is to t h e i n d i v i d u al . T h e s e p h e n omenal frames are what endow Dasein with mean- ing. Boss, on the other hand, felt that Dasein is not framed by a priori structures, but rather shines forth or l u m i n a tes the p h enomenal realm with meaning. Dasein was said by both Boss and Binswanger to be pitched toward t he future. T h er e i s a l s o a h i s t o r i city t o Dasein, a past that reflects the commitments a nd actions of earlier h u man b e i ngs w h o have pitched their Dasein into their futures and in the process thrown the current Dasein of people in one d i rection rather than an- other. Binswanger distinguished three worlds (welts ) in th e t o t a lity o f D a s ein : (I) the eigenwelt, or world of inner feelings and af- fections; (2) the umwelt, or the physical en- vironment around us, including both animate and inanimate things; and (3) the mitwelt, or the social world of people, including all those things we mean by society. To avoid being completely (I00 percent ) thrown by the intentions of others, we must behave authentically, assume responsibility for our commitments, and exhibit care in further- ing the possibilities that come up in the fu - turity of ou r l i v e s . W e m u s t o c c asionally transcend the familiar and routine ways of d oing things and pu t o u r selves at risk b y making new commitments. Though there is no formal sel f concept in existentialistic per- sonality theory, there is an emphasis on the i dentity of th e p e r son, wh o c o mes at l i f e phenomenally and opens it up to alternative possibilities. If this is not d one, the Dasein c an constrict. Emotions reflect th e u n i q u e pitch of Dasein that a p e r son ma y e x peri- ence at any point in t i m e . B i n swanger dis- cussed the difference between existential anx- iety and neurotic anxiety. The f o r mer i s a sense of alienation, a loss of world that might be captured in the idea of nothingness. It can be experienced as boredom and em ptiness. N eurotic anxiety stems m or e f r o m a c o n - stricted world-design, a simplistic and u n - r ealistic framing of the wo rld w h i c h m a k es the person vulnerable to collapse in the face of a challenge. Boss makes a comparable distinction be- t ween two kinds of g u i lt . E x i s t ential guilt arises from the basic sense of indebtedness that the person bears, since it is not possible t o fulfill every option in l i fe. A ff i r m ing on e alternative, we forgo many others. This kind of guilt is borne by all of us, and it reflects a s cience prompts such existential guilt, a n d this is not a s i c k ness as Freud sometimes made it appear to be. Neurotic guilt, on the o ther hand, is th e r e s ul t o f h a v i n g b e e n reared in an unhealthy environment. Com- mitment always brings about existential guilt of one sort or another. But neurotic guilt can spring from a lack of commitment, or it can sharpen the pain of existential guilt. Even so, we should keep these two types of anxiety and/or guilt separate. Psychotherapy aims at removing the neurotic forms but not the ex- istential forms of anxiety and /or guilt. Rather than speak of repression, the exis- tentialists suggest that an aspect of D a s ein has remained closed and inauthentic. Most of Freud's defense mechanisms are said to be due to underlying world-designs (Binswan- ger ) or inauthenticity (Boss). The existen- tialists criticize both psychoanalysis and be- h aviorism fo r a t t e m p t in g t o r e d u c e t h e Dasein to something else. Rather than taking Dasein as it is, these schools of therapy re- r ealistic assessment of e x i stence.

One genuine defense mechanism the existentialists might be said to recognize involves trusting to fate. To believe that fate will somehow enter into one's existence and decide alternatives is an escapist device which ultimately denies authentic living. The exis- tentialists do not a ccept clear-cut stages in life, but they do recognize that Dasein always has an historical development. The task of life is essentially to gain one's independence from the t h r o w n ness of others — or at least reduce the extent of s u c h d e p endency. If the Dasein does not move forward and be- come enriched in maturing, the existential- i sts speak of a stuck D asein, much i n t h e vein of the Jungian conception. The existen- tialists are also much more accepting of a r ole for religion in th e l i f e o f p e o ple. T h e existentialists do not wish to categorize peo- ple into typologies, but take a very individ- ualized view of each personality as a unique p roduct of th e i d e n t it y c o ncerned. To b e overly tradition-bound is to live an inauthen- tic life of \"everybody.\" The theory of illness employed in existen- tialism follows the themes of a c o nstricted Dasein, a stuck Dasein, or the self-chosen un- freedom leading to a kind of existential weak- ness for the individual, which then collapses a ltogether. Neurotics are people who h a v e created their own seriously constricted Dasein, surrendering their autonomy to o t h ers and eventually paying the price of inauthenticity. psychotics in their delusions and hallucina- tions reflect a completely new form of being- in-the-world, one in w h ic h s u pposed, inde- pendent forces t aunt, t h r e aten, and then actually direct what will take place. Each of the classic syndromes — ulcer cases, hysterias, phobias, sexual abnormalities, obsessive-com- pulsives, schizophrenias, and m a n ic-depres- s ives — reflect their own unique form of t h i s existential weakness and constricted Dasein. It i s not t he s pecific diagnosis that is i m - portant, but an h i storical understanding of the unique Dasein framed by or illuminated to the identity concerned. The mentally healthy person is said to be free to choose, hence transcend the given of life to affirm possibilities, assume a mature outlook, and be i n d ependently responsible. Daseinsanalysis is an insight therapy which seeks to aid a person to achieve these three broad goals in l i fe . Th e f u t u r e i s s t r essed because the person must let th e p ast stand and begin building a better life in the hence- forth. It i s i m p o r tant for t he c l i e nt to t r u s t the therapist, and existentialistic therapists take quite an active role in the establishment of a genuine, permissive relationship. Boss f elt that an important healing agent in t h e relationship is psychotherapeutic eros, that is, a unique kind of s elfless reverence for the client's existence and uniqueness. We are re- m inded of Rogerian writings at t h i s p o i n t . If the therapist cannot feel this commitment for the client, he or she should discontinue the therapy contact. Though something like positive or negative transference arises in ther- apy, the existentialists refuse to accept this as the literal transferring of anything. There is either some immature, groping attempt to c ement a bond t o t h e t h e r a p i s t (positive transference ), o r probably there i s a w e l l - deserved feeling of irritation for the fr uitless procedure (negative transference ) of observa- tion and m i s i nterpretation by t h e p s y c ho- analysts.

Interpretations are aimed at clarifying the world-design predicating th e p e r son' s phenomenal experience. Many of these inter- pretations bring out the stuck Dasein, the un- willingness people have to mature and as- sume responsibility in l i fe. Boss referred to the study of dreams as phenomenological ob- s ervation, which means that he tried to u n - derstand the dream at it s ow n l e v el, rather than making it fit some preconceived scheme. In a manner similar to Jung, the existential- ists reject Freud's manifest-versus-latent-con- t ent theory of d r eam f o r m ation.

Because of the central role he assigns to evolution in his concept of devel- opment, and because of his great emphasis on the developmental stability (he called this equi librium ) of higher-level cognitive conceptions, we have chosen to characterize Piaget's theory as evolutionary rationalism. This m e a n ing will be clarified as we move through Piaget's thought. In a sense, Piaget is to the phenomenologi- cal-existentialistic s chool of t h o u g h t (see Chapters 9 and 10 ) what Bandura (see Chap- ter 7 ) is to the behavioristic school of thought. That is, Piaget has tried to be comprehensive in his explanations of human behavior; in doing so h e r i v a l s B a n d u r a's eclecticism. However, where we saw Bandura uniting be- havioristic with cognitive terminology having less of a mechanistic sound to it (see p. 'N7), we will find P i a get moving i n t h e r e v erse d irection, so that h i s f u n d a m entally n o n - mechanistic theory e m b r aces t e r m i nology taken from cybernetics; he is willing to draw parallels between his explanations and those of clearly mechanistic theorists.' Even so, Piaget is a decidedly individualistic theoreti- cian who has much to say about human be- havior that is unique. Biographical Overview Jean Piaget was born on 9 August 1896 at Neu- chatel, Switzerland and died on 16 September 1980 at Geneva. His father, a t eacher and scholar of medieval literature, set the pattern for Piaget s own lifestyle in which a devotion to the study of factual matters is uppermost. Piaget tells us that he has always \"detested a ny departure from reality,\" ' and t hi s a t t i - tude takes on even greater significance when we realize that his m o ther a p parently suf- fered from pronounced neurotic tendencies. F or a t i m e h i s m o t h e r ' s maladjus tments spurred an interest in psychoanalysis and ab- normal psychology, but after he had achieved independence from his parents, Piaget lost all interest in such topics, preferring, as he tells us, \"the study of normality and of the work- i ngs of the intellect to that of t h e t r i ck s o f the unconscious.\" Piaget was a child prod- igy. At the age of ten, he submitted a one- page article on the albino sparrow to a jour- nal of natural history, and it w a s a ccepted for publication. He then obtained permission to study after hours at the museum of natural history in Neuchatel, specializing eventually in land and soft-water shells. He was on his way to becoming a naturalist and almost all of his free time was spent in collecting mol- P iaget continued to p u b l is h i n n a t u r a l h istory throughout his t een y e ars, and a n amusing outcome of his growing reputation i n the scientific li t erature wa s t h a t h e r e - ceived a letter oBering him a position as cura- tor of a mollusk collection in another town while he was still in secondary (high) school.

H e w a s given a traditional education in t hi s regard, but eventually he worked f ree o f r e l i g i ous dogma, preferring a completely scientiFic out- look. In his mid-teen years, an uncle, worried about Piaget's narrow interests in m o l l u sks, encouraged him to read Henri B ergson, the philosopher who espoused creative evolution.

Piaget was i m - pressed by this idea, but he also felt that Berg- son failed to provide an experimental basis f or his theories, and t h erefore, they w e r e open to easy rejection. After he had taken the baccalaureate de- gree in 1915, Piaget threw himself into the reading of a broad range of scholars, includ- ing Kant, Spencer, Comte, Fouillee, Lache- l ier, Boutroux, Lalande, Dur k h e im, T a r d e,"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i n d s of C onstructive Theories: J ean Piaget aud George A. Kelly 6 6 ' 7 Le Dantec, James, Ribot, and Janet. An im- p ortant teacher of this period was A . R e y - mond, a logician who in t roduced Piaget to the study of psychology and scientific meth- odology. Piaget learned from Reymond that \"logic stems from a sort of sp ontaneous or- ganization of acts.\" ' This idea of an organi- zation of acts into logic would combine with the Bergsonian conception of evolution as a dynamic, creative movement and remain with Piaget forever after. We will see its mature development in P i a get's conception of in- creasing stages of equilibration in d e velop- ment, culminating in the stability of mathe- matical formulations (refer below ). In 1918 Piaget took hi s d o ctoral degree from the University of Neuchatel, with a dis- sertation on the mollusks of Valais. He had by this time acquired an interest in psychol- ogy, w hich proinised to c o m bine hi s b i o - logical and philosophical interests. He went to Zurich hoping to w or k i n a p s y c h ology laboratory, but found nothing satisfactory. In the autumn of 1919 he went to Paris, where he was to spend two years studying patho- logical psychology at the Sorbonne. Piaget learned to interview m e ntal p a t ients here, which was important to his later work, be- cause he always considered his research style to be an adaptation of the clinical method.' He also studied more philosophy of science and was notably influenced by the historical- critical method of Brunschwieg. This is im- portant to our understanding of Piaget, for in his subsequent approach to the study of ge- netics, we have more than biology reflected, we have a decidedly historical interpretation of development being employed as well.' His career as genetic epistemologist really began when Piaget was asked to standardize some reasoning tests on Parisian children. He was given the right to use Alfred Binet's lab- oratory at the grade school of the rue de la G rangeaux-Belles in Paris. Binet, who w a s t hen deceased, had achieved fame for d e - vising the first effective means of assessing intelligence through the use of (IQ) tests. Rather than simply standardizing the reason- ing test he was given, Piaget engaged the c hildren in d i scussions patterned after t h e psychiatric questioning he had learned in the clinical method. He found that children up to the age of eleven or twelve have difFiculties unsuspected by the adult in identifying such t hings as the part common t o t w o w h o l e s . F or the next fe w y e ars, he c o n t i nued h i s study of both normal and abnormal children, which in time convinced him that here was that method of studying developmental-evo- lutionary processes that he had found want- ing in Bergson. He could actually study the laws of mental development empirically. For example, he found that logic is no t i n b o r n b ut rather develops little by l i t tl e o ver t h e childhood years. Concepts of cause-eRect are not understood by children until t hey h a ve reached a certain stage of development. Piaget interpreted this development as an evolution o f mental structures. In a s e n se, he f o u n d himself studying an \"embryology of i n t elli- gence.\" ' The next career move by Piaget established him professionally and fixed his life's course thereafter. In 1921 he was offered and ac- cepted the position of director of studies at the Institut J. J. Rousseau of Geneva. His re- sponsibilities involved guiding and associating with students working on advanced degrees, i ncluding the d i r ection o f t h e i r w o r k o n studies of Piaget's choosing. Piaget had by now decided to study th e d e v elopment of thought for itself, using his ne w i n t e r view method which would take him in d i r ections he could not necessarily predict but was will- ing to follow. He and his students did their work at the primary school of the Rousseau institute and the local public s chools.

He w a s widely read and i n v ited t o m a n y d i ff e r ent countries where he presented his researches and theories of development. As th e y ears passed, I iaget broadened the scope of his in- vestigations, studying not only language and the verbal expression of ideas but the manip- ulations and experiences young children have with objects even before they have learned their native tongues. He also worked to per- fect his theoretical formulations, noting in later years that sometimes his colleagues took more interest in his empirical findings on the s tages of development than they did in t h e basic theory on w h ich th e r e searches were based.' This is a distinctive characteristic of Jean Piaget — a desire to advance theory as well as method (empirical research findings ). We will in this chapter emphasize his theory and deal in less detailed fashion than is cus- tomary in books on Piaget with his develop- mental studies per se. In 1925 his former teacher, A. Reymond, v acated the chair of philosophy at the Un i - versity of Neuchatel, and Piaget was given a portion of this appointment. Later he was ap- pointed to the science faculty of the Univer- sity of Geneva, where he taught child psy- chology. Piaget has also taught courses on the philosophy of science, a nd we see i n h i s mature writings a genuine concern with the problems of scientific investigation and ex- planation. Much has been said of P i a g et's children, two daughters and a son born be- tween the years 1925 and 1931. With the help of his wife, Piaget carefully studied and re- corded the development of hi s c h i l dren, so that in some of hi s w r i t i n gs, he refers not only to subjects selected from the local school system, and so on, but also to o bservations m ade on his own c h i l d ren f ro m c r a dl e t o school years. Over his long career, Piaget has worked with m an y c o l leagues and friends, but two who should be specifically mentioned are A. Szeminska and B. Inhelder. His pub- lication rate of articles and books relating to genetic epistemology has been astonishing, and today he is cited in the wr i t i ngs of col- l eagues with a f r e q u e ncy second onl y t o Freud. His worldwide appeal has remained constant, and his books are regularly trans- lated into many other languages. In 1929 Piaget became a professor of the h istory of scientific thought at t h e U n i v e r - sity of Geneva; within a fe w y e ars he was also named a codirector of the Institut Rous- seau, w hich eventually afFiliated wit h t h e university. In 1939 Piaget was made profes- sor of sociology at the University of Geneva, and a year later, moved to a chair in experi- mental psychology. He was also named direc- tor of the un iversity's psychological labora- tory. After World War I I e n d ed, Piaget was named president of the Swiss Commission to UNESCO and later served on it s executive council. In 1952, he became a pr ofessor of child psychology at the Sorbonne. In 1955- 1956 Piaget founded an international Center for Genetic Epistemology at the U n i v ersity of Geneva. Here, he assembled a staff which studied various aspects of mental d evelop- ment from an i n t e r disciplinary perspective, employing knowledge from the biological sci- ences, psychology, sociology, m a t hematics, a nd cybernetics, to name only a few o f t h e sources Piaget is willing to tap.

At first, we reach reflexively, but as we practice our reaching, we are learning in a way that is no longer reflexive nor simply To understand Piaget, we must first grasp that he distinguishes between the copying of an action by internalizing (or interiorizing ) its actual pattern of motion and the copying o f an action by i n t e rnalizing an i m ag e o f w hat needs to be done or ho w i t i s t o b e carried out.\" We do not learn about life by first forming an image of what needs doing o r what we w ish w o ul d h a p pen an d t h e n carrying this action forward to o v ert action. The analysts of Part I looked at the infant's mind (psyche ) in this way and P i aget dis- agreed with them. We must f' irst act and then g radually learn what we can o r c a n not d o over our life's ever-changing course. Piaget emphasizes that \"as regards action itself, we have time and again seen that it plays a fai. m ore fu n damental r o l e t h a n d o e s t h e image.\"\" T o i n t e r i orize is thus to t ake in a cognitive awareness of the patterned action by abstracting from our play in the crib. As we grow older, we can, of course, copy the be- havior of others by simply observing them and forming an image of their b ehavior, as in Bandura's modeling conception (see p. O3). But there is a long period of d evelop- rnent between the crib and this adult stage of behavior. T he most basic structure o f a c t i o n i n Piaget's theory is called the scheme (also re- ferred to as schema ). A scheme may be de- fined as \"what there is in c o m mo n a m on g several different and an alogous actions.\" \" For example, one such scheme might con- cern the understanding of distance. Infants learn, through reaching and m o v in g about a nd through others moving i n r e l a t ion t o them, that things and /or people may be close Structural Constructs Construction o f Patterns Among Relatea' Actions Piaget's lessons from Bergson and Reymond left him as unwilling to focus on static, un- changing structures as are the phenomeno- logically oriented theorists of Part III. Living organisms may take on patterned shapes, as all things in experience take on patterns, but we must always appreciate that the basic na- ture of reality is change, movement, and de- velopment.

T h i s k n o w l edge permits the maturing child t o g e n e r alize from one action situation to another. Moving toward the kitchen sink is similar to reach- ing for a toy that is away from our side. Even so, Piaget does not consider a scheme to be identical to a concept of the understanding. Concepts are broader, taking into considera- t ion both what is common and what is dif- ferent about not only actions but all sorts of things (see George Kelly's definition of con street, p. 713 ). A scheme is what is common among diRerent actions carried out at diRer- ent times — like our moving about to c l o se distances between ourselves and other people or th i ng s i n m a n y d i R e r e n t s i t u a t i o ns. Though each person frames his or her scheme individually, it is also true that, because life is similar for everyone, the schemes we all make up share common meanings, by anal- ogy if nothing else. It is such shared schemes that make the learning of language possible.\" We can communicate through words because we have begun our understanding of things in schemes which permit us to grasp words, as the specific word distance is learned after we have already formed a scheme of this life experience. When Piaget looks at the human mind as a totality, he thinks of the schemara (plural for schema ) as interlacing parts of this much broader structure — reminding us of the field theories of gestalt psychology (see p. 571). Piaget does not consider himself a gestaltist, but he admits that had he read Wertheimer or Kohler early in h i s c a reer, he probably would have become a member of this school of thought.\" But he is surely within the the- o retical traditions of Part II I o n t h e m a t t e r of looking at behavior globally rather than reductively. The whole-pattern is not just the sum of its p a r t-patterns. The part-patterns (schemes ) interlace and ar e i n constantly elements that count.\"\" shifting relations both internally and exter- nally with other part-patterns to form in turn a whole-pattern. When we as children put to- gether schemes of distance with other schemes like \"resting upon,\" we can achieve a whole- pattern, enabling us to m ov e t o w ar d s ome- thing (for example, a table ) to place some- thing upon it (for example, a cup ). Two s chemes — \"distance\" and \" r e s t in g u p o n \" - combine into a m or e complex structure of action. The resulting w h o le-pattern is c r e- a ted not as t w o s i n g le s a d d in g u p t o a double but as a new pattern o f relationship, a d istinctive singularity u n i q u e u n t o i t s e l f . Piaget is careful to point out that in the forrna tion of patterns, it is \" th e r e l a tions among The term Piaget uses to speak generally about patterned relationships like this is struc sure.

This is called a ssociativity in m a t h ematics, and t h ere ar e o ther transformations that c o ul d b e c i t e d , such as closure, unity, and inversion. How- ever, for present purposes, all we need grasp is the fact that p atterned relations can be changed within a structure even though the overall systematic form remains identifiable. It is in this sense that Piaget can say \"trans- formation and i d entity ar e f o r ever i n sepa- rable.\"\" T hi s reminds us of the Heraclitian insight that we never step in the same river twice, even though there is a constant river- form (logos) moving before our eyes each day (see p. 4). The river transforms itself as an ongoing system even as it r e t ains its identifiable pattern. Referring to the transformation of physical objects like this is not inappropriate. Piaget n otes that \"a structure would lose all t r u t h va ue if it did not have this direct connection with the [ physical] facts.\"\" A s a g e n e t i c epistemologist, Piaget is primarily interested in the structures that relate to the formation and meaning of knowledge, but knowledge would have no validity if th e s t r u ctures of the mind failed to match up to the structures of physical reality. The reason our m e ntal structures do coincide to our e x p erience of r eality is because they actually begin in th e physical patterning of real events.\" As sug- gested in the quote above regarding animals changing their species, the very survival of organisms in nature depends on their capacity t o structure physical patterns favoring ad - justrnent to reality. Thus, Piaget notes, \"The organism adapts itself by materially construc- i ng new forms to fit t he m i n t o t h ose of th e universe, whereas intelligence extends this creation by constructing mentally structures which can be applied to those of the environ- ment.\"\" T h us, the physical body of any ani- m al represents a structure having b ot h a n i dentifiable for m a n d a l s o a con s t a n t l y changing process of interaction with the en- v ironment in w h i c h i t t a k e s o n c h e m i c al nutrients and gives oR wastes to carry on the From these basically physical exchanges, a higher-order organization occurs which is also physical; the structures involved, however, p ermit that c r eative i n t erplay w i t h n a t u r e that Piaget referred to above as \"transform- ing the world\" i n h u m a n b e h a v ior. T h e se higher-order structures also develop through t ransformation of e a r l ie r f o r m s . \"Actually the whole process of development, starting o ut with perception and culminating in i n - telligence, demonstrates clearly that transfor- mations continually increase in importance, as opposed to the original predominance of s tatic perceptual fo r ms.\" \" T h i s i d e a o f moving from the static and un changing to the fluid and flexible structure is important in Piagetian developmental theory.

In doing so, we construct structures by our own design. This brings us to th e c entral theoretical term employed by both theorists of this chap- ter. Piaget dramatizes its importance to his structuralist theory when he states, \"There is no structure apart from construction, either abstract or g e netic.\" \" U n l i k e G e o r g e A . Kelly (see below, p. 713 ), who viewed con- struction as a purely cognitive (mental ) pro- cess, Piaget suggests that we have both a ma terial construction of b o d i ly a d a ptations in organic evolution (generating new species, and so on ) and also a more abstract, cogni- tive construction o f structures which the hu- man being uses to transform his or her world (see earlier quotes in this section ). We might say that for P i aget, the general term c o n struction m eans to b r i n g a b o ut a s t r u c t u r e (schema, and so on ) in th e o n g o ing, sys- tematic processes of both organic and mental life. In g e n eral, t hi s t a k e s p l ace t h r o u gh either combination and /or difjerentiation of part-structures (schemata ) or whole-struc- tures.\" In organic evolution, an animal might differentiate by evolving a unique appendage (fin, claw, and so on ), making p ossible rno- tions that better adapt it to reality than an- other animal. In the case of human beings, a structure might have been created by com- bining two seemingly unrelated schemes in an unusual way. For example, the discovery of t he wheel might h av e o c curred w hen t h e human animal put together the scheme \"roll- ing\" with th e s c h eme \" unmoving\" i n a unique way by having a stable bed of wood undergirded with poles and slices of logs that The outcome of both (organic and cogni- tive ) constructions is a new structure, and in Piagetian theory, it is u sually assumed that such changes are advances or pr ogressions over what had existed to that time. An animal b etter adapted to the physical world is i m - proved over one not so endowed, and a rea- soning human being who can reconstruct the w orld of natural f o rm s can t r a n sform i t t o his or her liking. The essential point in both organic and cognitive construction is that the a nimal is actively involved in w h a t c o m e s about. Piaget dislikes th e B r i t i s h A s socia- tionistic account of behavior w h ic h m e r ely assumes that the newborn child is a reactive mechanism having the capacity to know that when a stimulus occurs, it is spatially located either \"over here\" or \"over there.\"\" To the contrary, says Piaget, \"the perception of space involves a. gradual construction and certainly d oes not exist ready m ade at t h e o u t set o f mental development.\"\" T h e p h y s i cal envi- ronment does, of course, impinge upon the developing person to influence what organic or cognitive structures will be f o r m ed, bu t there is also a reciprocity of structural forma- tion. Reminding us at this point of Bandura (see Chapter 7 ), Piaget says: \"Knowledge does not begin in the I, and it does not begin in the [ physicalI object; i t b e g i n s i n t h e interactions. . .. there is a r e c i p r ocal and simultaneous construction of th e s u bject on the one hand and the object on the other.\"\" Cognition as Equilibrating Operations Since mental activity (cognition ) is a sys- tematic process of constructing e x perience (making structures ) through an i n t e raction could rotate."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"T heories: Jean Piaget and George A.

This heavy reliance on th e p h y sico- biological basis of phenomenal understanding s ometimes leads to confusion am ong t h o se who study Piaget. He seems to be saying that mind reduces to body, and therefore it is a kind of secondary phenomenon. Though one might argue that this is the practical outcome of his theory, Piaget at least does not want to suggest that mind or cognition reduces to the physical body. Mind has legitimacy in its own right, and through his uniting conception of c onstruction, Piaget attempts t o s h o w h o w patterned structures occur at both the organic and the cognitive levels of existence. All he wants to do is remind the phenomenologists that their cognitive conceptions are not given at birth, but must in f act begin in th e c o n- structive capacities of the body as foreshad- owed in the reflexive movements, the sensori- m otor actions that w e a l l b r i n g w i t h u s biologically when we are born. The develop- m ental course of construction is t h u s f r o m body-to-mind as a matter o f fact! W h at i s important is to recognize the structuralisrn of this constructive process and not to try reduc- ing one level (mind) to the other (body).

The first of t h ese is assimiLation, or the taking-in of the surround- ing environment on the basis of an existing scheme or the more complex (whole-)struc- t ures they make up.\" F r o m t h i s p o in t f o r - ward, we will refer simply to the schemes or schemata that people construct, recognizing b ut not m e n t ioning t ha t t h ese m or e b a s i c with the physical world, Piaget must no w propose terms that enable us to describe how this mutual interdependence of the subject (person ) and o b j e ct (environment ) takes place. This is somewhat of a c h i c k e n-egg problem, difficult for all theorists to deal with. F ew theorists of t h i s v o l u m e (including Jung) have wanted to say that a person is born with all of his or her knowledge struc- tured into understanding (innate ideas ) . Ob- viously, we all learn from living. The behav- iorists of Part II are prone to emphasize the environment, but even t hey r e cognize that the organism must somehow process (pattern, order ) the stimuli that are input, and Ban- dura in particular insisted upon the role of an active organism in r eciprocal interaction with the environment. The phenomenologists of Part III have tended to put their emphasis on the person's conceptualizations, which are essentially what is meant by the phenomena, in preference to t h e i n d e p endent r e ality, which is more on the side of the noumena. The phenomenal field of R o g ers (Chapter 9), the world design of Binswanger (Chap- ter 10 ), or the personal constructs of Kelly (see below ) all point to a k i n d o f p e r s o n- over-environment ( phenomena over n o u - mena ) emphasis on the source of knowledge and understanding. Piaget is no real excep- tion to this rule. He f o cuses on the person a s actor and conceptualizer, but unlike t h e other phenomenologists, he insists on study- ing the biological basis of construction. T hat is, the patterns of structure that th e other phenomenologists of Part III accept as given in the phenomenal realm are said by Piaget to be derived from organic develop- ment. It is pointless to speak of a phenomenal field as ordered spatially in the newborn child, when, so far as Piaget is concerned, experi- m ental evidence proves that children m u s t construct their life space over a period of time.

For example, a baby may observe s omeone's eyes close and open w i d e o n c e again, and in t r y in g t o a s similate this, the baby may open and close his or her mouth.\" The assimilation here is in error, and in order for the action to b e i m i t a ted p r operly, the child will h av e t o d i ff e r e n tiate between a visual-action scheme an d a m o u t h - a c tion scheme. In making this accommodation, the child is drawing an analogy between mouth a ction and eye action, but the point i s t h a t through experience, a behavior has had to be modified and reschematized. In like fashion, throughout life we are forced to m o dify or transform our schemata in the f ace of new experience, as we learn that we cannot grasp t he moon or t ha t e v erything w e p l ac e on water does not float. Life is a continuing interplay of assimila- tion and accommodation in our growing cog- n itive understanding, and in o r d e r fo r o u r lives to be reasonably well adjusted, it is good for these two processes to be w el l c o o rdi- nated.\" There is a reciprocal interaction go- ing on here, and if it is not balanced off rea- sonably well, the person can become rigidly fixed in schemata that are no longer reality- oriented, or conversely, can be readily swayed by irrelevancies in the environment. Piaget calls such reciprocal balancing relations equi librium, which in this instance he would de- fine as the compensatory adjustments made in personal action in response to intrusions from the external environment.\" H o w e v er, he has a much broader referent in mind in his equi- l ibrium concept, one that c o v ers both t h e physical and th e p s y chological aspects of structures can be combined into th e l a rger w hole-structures or s t r u c t u res p r o per d i s - cussed in the previous section. All organic life tends progressively to assimilate more and m ore of t h e s u r r o u n d in g e n v i r o n m ent a s growth proceeds (for example, the chemical substances in foods and water are assimilated during development ). In constructing struc- tures at either the organic or th e c o g n i tive level, the organism is a ssimilating. Babies suck their thumb because they have assimi- lated this appendage to the schema of their mother's breast.\" As children mature, they can assimilate all kinds of actions of others by drawing a sort of analogy between their schemata and the observed behaviors. Piaget calls this prehen sion, which is an early form of imitation that can occur without the use of language.\" An- other form of assimilation occurs, called the circular reaction, which Piaget describes as f'ollows: \"A circular reaction is a reproductive assimilation. It is the mechanism by which a scheme is developed. The child performs an a ction, is interested in th e r e s ult, an d r e - peats the same action again. . . . It is this repetition that engenders the scheme.\"\" By repeating an action such as picking up a toy, the infant gradually differentiates the specific m ovements, structuring or c o n structing t h e schema of \"picking up\" as something distinc- tive from the schema of \"reaching.\" Assimi- l ation is, therefore, another way of t a l k i n g about the construction process, a process that has two sides.

Thus, he can say, \" . .. |the] developmental theory necessarily calls upon the concept of equilib- rium, since all behavior tends toward assuring an equilibrium between internal and external factors or, speaking more generally, between assimilation and accommodation.\" \" In other words, as the maturing individual experiences disequilibria\" be t ween the internal (assimi- lation ) and the external (accommodation ) re- lations of its functioning schernata, a motive is generated to rectify the disbalance. We will take up Piaget's motivational constructs be- low, but for now we merely wish to demon- strate that, according to Piaget, in resolving the disequilibria successfully, the individual necessarily progresses, advances, that is, d e velops higher and higher levels of structure. Furthermore, according to Piaget, the equi- librations (acts bringing about equilibrium ) that have been achieved in the past remain with the person, so that as life proceeds, the person who develops successfully should be m ore advanced than the person who d o e s not. In general, adults, because of the very fact that they have equilibrated for years, are more advanced cognitively and emotionally than children. P ut another way, as we go along l i v i n g our lives, we gradually work out a set of use- f ul notions and points of view t hat fi t o u r understanding of reality pretty well. We call this our knowledge or our intelligence. The four-year-old child has a shaky grasp of what the concept of school or schooling means, but as the person develops over the y ears through elementary and s e condary school e ducation, an in creasingly stable an d a l s o complex and sophisticated understanding of school develops. As we saw in the transforma- tions of mathematics discussed in the pre- vious section, higher-level thought always has this quality of being able to change relations without losing the identifiable structure (re- call Heraclitus' Logos and the ever-changing As noted in the introduction to this chap- ter, Piaget's entire approach to the study of c ognition has borrowed h eavily f r o m t h e terminology used an d r e a soning p r o cesses followed by mathematicians.

Piaget refers to this breaking free from what we literally per- ceive in order to cognize, to thing about the various aspects of what we perceive, as decen tration (or the act of a' ecentering ). To be glued concretely to merely what is perceived (schematized ) is called centration (or the act of centering ). To be c reative in r e a soning, we have to decenter and lose our simplistic understandings of our external reality. When we decenter, we can improve our level of ad- justment, because \"decentration . . . results in equilibrium between assimilation and ac- these particulars that \" I a m n o t a t h l e t i c .\" Later, when someone asks us to try golf, we may deduct from our generalization (\"I am not athletic\" ) to a judgment on the particu- lar prospect facing us and conclude, \"I will be terrible on the golf links.\" The question of accuracy is not at issue here. We may indeed be a poor athlete, or it may be that we have not yet found our sport. But in reasoning as we do, we are in eRect moving up and down a hierarchy of levels of abstraction (see p. 20). We move from the particular (less ab- stract ) to the general (more abstract ) in in- ducting and vice versa in deducting. How- e ver, Piaget has found that early in l if e w e also move from the particular to the particu- lar, unable somehow to abstract in our more s yncretic style of t h o u gh t t o c o n s t r uct a hierarchy of f r o m l e s ser to m o r e a b s tract meanings. Piaget calls this reasoning at the level of particulars transd'uction. ' W e would r e ason tr ansductively if w e played golf and found ourselves doing well at this sport, and concluded thereby that our tennis, soccer, or swimming skills had al so improved. In other words, we would not have diRerentiated within the structured class of athletics the one sport in which we did well f rom the others in w h ich w e di d n o t . I m - proving in one (particular ), we assumed we improved in another (particular ). Except for the brain-damaged or the mentally retarded, adults do not ordinarily reason transductively, but children always begin reasoning this way before they think more hierarchically by way of induction and deduction. Piaget gives as an example the case of a child who reasoned that if a hunchback had inRuenza and was cured of it, the First a8iction would disappear as well.\" Another way in w h ich Pi aget has defined transduction is as \"reasoning without reversible nestings of a hierarchy of classes"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Tsvo Kinds of Constructive Theories: J ean Piaget and George A. Kelly 6 7 7 commodation, an equilibrium which of neces- sity tends towards a reversible structure.\"\" W hen a r e v e r sible st ructure e x i sts i n thought, this means we can turn it around in mind and look at it from all sides. Our child can essentially say, \" Wait a minute. I h a v e been thinking t assimilation j that sickness is sickness' but maybe looked at from that per- son's problems over there [accommodation ], this is too simple. My point of view just may not fit the facts over there.\" This would be an example of reciprocaL reversibiLity, ' with the reciprocity (inverse relationship ) taking place between assimilation and accommoda- tion. Piaget also refers to negationaL revere ibiLity.\" In this case the person is capable of questioning his or he r ow n v i e w p o i nts by essentially negating their certainty (\"I could be wrong, maybe a hunchback isn't an illness like a cold after all\" ) or by bringing the facts into question by negating them (\"How do we know these so-called innuenza symptoms aren't due to an allergy>\" ). Once we are able to do this, an important development occurs in cognition. \"It is this freeing from percep- tion that marks the beginning of operations properly so called, which are thus seen to be the result of the progressive reversibility of thought.\" \" The concept of the operation or operational thin (ing summarizes in a way all of the cog- nitive constructs that have been advanced to this point in Chapter 11. This is as close as we get to saying \"thought in action\" or \"cog- nition\" in Piagetian theory. There are four c haracteristics of an operation.\" It i s a n i n - teriorized action, so that it can be carried out in thought as well as executed materially in physical behavior ( that is, we ar e t a l k i n g about cognitive as well as organic structures in referring to operations ). An operation is a reversible action, so it can be enacted in op- posite directions. Operations also have an in- v ariant structure about them, r etaining t h e identifiable characteristic of the system even though they change relations through revers- ibility. Finally, no operation exists alone; it is always related to a system or t o tal st ruc- ture. This latter point is i m p o r t ant because i t tells us t h a t o p e r a t ions ar e m o r e t h a n schemata and always involve a \"co-ordination o f differentiated actions within t h e f r a m e - work of a single whole.\"\" As we shall see, operational thought begins at what Piaget will call a concrete level, one that is above transductive reasoning but that is still not very advanced (developed ). The child will begin to interrelate different parts of a total pattern under consideration with- o ut yet attaining the definite m o b ility a n d complete reversibility of th e m o r e r a t i o n al operations of the adult.\" Th e m o r e r ational t hought becomes and th e m o r e i t a t t a i n s equilibrium (including the Heraclitian iden- tity of form ), the more abstract it becomes. And with this abstraction we witness an ever- increasing stability of o r g a nizational struc- ture; in eRect, thought becomes increasingly systematic. The highest levels of such abstrac- tion occur in the operations of formal logic and/or mathematics.\" The person can now think of m u l t i p l ication as an \"addition of additions,\" reRecting a beautifully reversible construction in which multiplication and ad- dition are one, even though they are also kept separate in schematic organization. The critic might object that mathematical reasoning is not based on the motions of an action, but P iaget's fundamental assumption is that al l mathematics arises from action patterns. M athematics for P i a get i s s i m p l y t h e higher stages of biological evolution, a purely \"man-made\"\" construction that defines rela- tions among inanimate actions and provides a set of universal structures of great stability a nd reversibility.

Piaget's f u n d a mental a s sumption about human nature, and the reason we have called him an evolutionary rationalist, may be seen in the following summation: \"Hence the universe is known to man only through l ogic and mathematics, the product of h i s m ind, but he can only k no w ho w h e c o n - structed mathematics and logic by studying himself psychologically and biologically, that is, in terms of the entire universe.\"\" smelling, feeling, and so o n ).

We picture ourselves go- ing into and coming out of h o uses, both as we actually do enter and leave, but also later in our imagination. The fact that we can think about things like houses even when we are not perceiving them (no house is directly present ) signifies that we have represented these schemata in mind. Representation or imagination is not only ac- tive when w e a r e a w a y f r o m h o u s es, of course. To represent an object in mind when it is present is the same operation as repre- senting an object in mind when it is absent.\" Here is where we find a decidedly phenom- enological emphasis in Piagetian theory. He does not want to say that we use our active imagination in thoughts only w h en we a r e not in direct contact with environmental ob- jects (people, things, weather conditions out- side, and so on ) . We constantly use our imaginations in constructing our kn owledge of the perceived world. Of course, being able to represent this world allows us to go beyond the present situation facing us, extending our cognitions (thoughts ) out into both space and time.\" We can place ourselves into the past or the future, jump over in mind from where we are to where we might be in location. Since representation tends to bring in (in- teriorize ) the external world to the cognitive sphere of understanding, we can also see it as a form of accommodation.\" T hat is, even though there is always the equilibrating in- teraction of assimilation and accommodation going on, the basic thrust of representation is t o accommodate th e m e n t a l s c h e m at a t o something else. A r e p resentation represents something else. Piaget would say that as rep- resentation becomes increasingly abstract, we can begin speaking of concepts taking place in mind, rather than images.\" That is, as we The Dynamics o f Human Operations We now have an understanding of Piaget's highly fluid conception of p atterned orders (structures ) taking form across all levels of life, beginning in th e o r ganic and evolving to ever-higher stages of stable identity and r eversibility through equilibration. With th i s background, we can now review a n u m b er of concepts bearing on the higher-level opera- t ions — remembering always that w he n w e speak of an operation, we are speaking of an interiorized structure, hence a mental organi- zation of some pattern. N ow , p a t t erns exist independently of m i n d i n p h y s i cal r e ality.

W e h av e p er- c eived many houses, but now i n t h i n k i n g about the concept \"house,\" we might begin getting all kinds of ideas about what a house might be someday. We might even redesign the typical house and come up w it h s o m e- thing that does not even look like the actual h ouses we have perceived in th e p a st. I n order to do so, we would have to decenter and, through higher-level conceptions based on reversible operations, dream up an alter- native in our mind which is entirely creative. To the extent that we center on perceptions, o ur representations remain very r i gi d a n d concrete, and therefore they are unlikely to be very creative or innovative.

Thought is a c ontinuous series of constructions in w h i ch the hierarchical classes, groupings, and sys- tems of knowledge gradually evolve over the years of maturation from childhood to adult- hood.\" Mind is t h e refore a continuing pro- c ess of constructive activity w i t h a l a r g e a mount of self-construction involved.\" W e will discuss the role of self below, as an aspect of the motivational constructs in Piagetian theory. As we shall see, Piaget does accept the role of an identity factor in human behav- ior. People construct their worlds, and they construct a picture of themselves within this complexity of interlacing factors. The natural attitude of the mind is to be credulous, that is, to believe everything that is perceived and c onstructed as basically true.\" Y o un g c h i l - dren demonstrate this most clearly. It is not until later that doubt creeps in (via recipro- cal or negational reversibility ), and it is some time before the young person can understand what it means to look at things hypothetically. Having seen how Piaget accepts a phe- nomenological theme, we might now demon- strate the reverse instance. This arises when Piaget tells us: \" . . . there are n o i n n a t e structures in the human mind w h ich simply come into being.. . al l ou r m e n tal structures must be constructed.\"\" T hi s position would directly contradict what some existentialists call the a priori ontological structure (see p. 634). The gestalt laws of o r g a n ization are also interpreted by many psychologists to exist mentally as an aspect of human nature from birth (see p. 568). Though P i aget realizes that assimilation must come b e f ore accom- modation in all circular reactions — because to accommodate means a previous schema exists and this \"implies assimilation\" \"— he also contends that the very e rst time a scheme is organized (in early life ), this process is based on the copying of a biological structure M in d . begins by accommodating bodily c o nstruc- tions which assimilate at the o r g anic level. For example, a common organic assimilation is that of taking in f oo d n o u r i shment. W e might say that the infant accommodates this taking-in organic scheme to an i n t eriorized mental assumption by credulously believing all that is perceived is true (\"taken-in\" as per- ceived without doubt ) . There are innate bodily structures in the form of sensorimotor actions called reflexes. The sucking response is one such example, and so from birth, the child begins to suck at t he mother's breast automatically and t h e n later assimilates to this action (as we have noted above ) his or her t h u mb . L o o ked at this way, the mind may be said to imitate or learn from the innate structures of the body.

Bodily constructions are not operational. They lack the reversibility and the stability of form that we have seen characterizes ab- stract levels of thought. Hence, in time as we mature, we all l i t e rally create a sphere of c ognitive understanding w h ic h m a k e s u s more than strictly organic organisms. Indeed, o ur mental operations take on g r e ater i m - portance in our personal lives and for human- ity as a whole than the innate organic struc- tures on the basis of which they have been patterned. T his treatment of ho w m i n d o r g a n i z e s from the innate structures of body is unique and stamps Piaget as a theorist apart from the mainstream of the phenomenological-existen- tialistic school — a school to which he is never- theless closer than either psychoanalysis or behaviorism. When Piaget uses the term be havior, h e couches it in l i g h t o f t h e b a s i c terminology we have been considering. Thus, h e observes that \"every behavior.. . h a s tw o poles: assimilation to earlier schemas and ac- commodation of these schemas to new situa- tions.\"\" Behavior is action, and it therefore bears a necessary relation to the entire pr o- cess of beginning life i n s ensorimotor con- struction and moving through development to the cognitive operations of mind. Behav- ior also involves motives and valued goals, but as these are properly motivational concep- tions, we will put them oR for consideration below. Piaget would say that w hat i s g e nerally called intelligence consists of establishing per- manent relations between schema that cover greater and greater spatiotemporal intervals. Our representations extend a c ross various perceptions and organize into a stable, perma- nent understanding of what seems related to what, or how one event bears an implication for another event.\" Implications reach for the future and therefore we call intelligent those We can plan our actions and anticipate their outcomes before they even take place when we behave intelligently. Piaget has no faith in so-called IQ tests, feeling that though statis- tical findings of a p e rson's performance on various tasks in relation to other people's per- formances may have a pr actical benefit in prediction, they never tell us anything about the operations involved in d o in g t h ese IQ tasks.\" This interest in how th e p erson ac- tually accomplishes a task, remembers, or- ganizes, and so on, is what got Piaget started on his long career as genetic epistemologist. The emphasis on permanence in relations among schema in Piaget s view of intelligence is important, because this is what he means by conservation, a characteristic of operational thought he has studied in great detail. Piaget r eminds us that every n o tion w e h a v e i n common sense of a lasting value presupposes a fixed or set structure, a permanence in def- i nition.\" Fo r example, when we discussed the constancy principle in Chapter I (see p. 52), its fu ndamental idea wa s t h a t s o m e- thing (force) remains permanent in a closed system. If we look at o ther w i d ely accepted scientific principles like that of inertia or con- sider moral precepts like the G o l den Rule, what gives them meaning is the fact that we can all grasp a permanent, unchanging given that retains its structure, even though we may apply this organization to d i f f erent specific instances. We may speak of inertia as it af- f ects the rolling w h e els of a r a c i n g a u t o - m obile or the tu mbling of a r o c k d o w n a s loping hill. T r e ating o t hers as w e w o u l d have them treat o u rselves may serve as a principle in r elating to p e ople o f a l l a g e s, races, and sexual identities. The principles do not change. Piaget believes that it is this ten- dency for thought to take on such permanent conceptual organizations that gives the exis- actions that order fut ure l i nes of b ehavior."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i n d s of C onstructive Theories: Jean Piaget and George A.

We m i gh t b e tempted to conclude from this that there were a priori organizations in mind necessitating s uch a discovery, no m a tter wh o d i d t h e thinking. Piaget, on the other hand, would hold that it was because of the developmental evolution of higher-level operations that this common discovery was possible. Both New- ton and Leibniz, beginning as children and following the leads of other thinkers who had already constructed certain stable (conserved ) mathematical structures, carried this evolu- t ionary process forward to it s n a t u ral a n d necessary end state. This development was not an e ffect of an a p r i o r i s t r u c t ure but rather a point o f arriva/ f ollowing a l o n g period of construction. More than one mind could make the journey to arrive wh ere it did, but the end state of pe r manent (con- served ) mathematical or der was evolved nevertheless. We have now seen Piaget both agree and disagree with aspects of the phenornenologi- c al-existentialistic theoretical line. We h a v e also suggested that Piaget is clearly not a be- havioristic theorist, since he believes that stim- ulus input would never directly influence be- havior until a f ter i t h a d b e e n c o n structed and equilibrated. This would seem to remove P iagetian theory f ro m a n y h i n t o f h e i n g m echanistic. However, as we n o ted i n t h e introductory comments to t hi s ch apter (p. 668), it so happens that Piaget does embrace cybernetic theory, a point of view that many personologists believe is not truly compatible with his otherwise more humanistic orienta- tion. The feature of cybernetics that attracts Piaget is the feedbac ( loop. Recall from Chap- ter 7 (p. %0) that feedback occurs when a p ortion of the ou tput f r o m a c o m p u t e r r e - turns as input to the computer, so that there is a possibility for a d aptation t o c h a n ging For example, a robot employing the mech- anisms of cybernetics might have its core elec- t rical computer send output to it s \" l e gs\" i n - dicating a move to the left. Novv, part of this o utput message would also return as i n p u t t o the core computer, so t ha t i f t h e l e g s bumped something while underway, this new message of \"getting bumped\" in conjunction with \"moving left\" w o ul d corr lbine as new input to the computer. In this case, thanks to the computer's program, a new output could be sent to the legs, like \"back up and move ahead to the right\" or some such. Wi t hout the additional feedback of \"moving left,\" the computer might have continued sending the legs to the left in an ineffective effort to get past whatever the obstacle was. Feedback is essential information if an ongoing process is to modify or regulate its course while con- tinually underway. Piaget has concluded that feedback is es- sentially the same thing he had earlier called the circular reaction of the equilibration pro- cess, and the reason he holds out h ope of uniting his theory with cybernetics is because he believes that both approaches deal with the question of self-regulation in an ongoing process. In discussing his construct of equil- ibration, Piaget once said: Noir I d i d ' no t u s e c y bernetic ter minology when I began talking o f this factor, but none thewless since the beg'nning I ha v e in s is ted that it uas not a balance o f opposing forces, a simple case o f phys ! cal equilibrium but tha't it was a sel f regulation And -o f course .today cybernetics is precisely that, the study o f seLf regulating models.' circumstances."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Part III 682 Ka n tian Models in the Phenornenological Outlook P iaget does not delude himself into t h i n k - ing that human beings are identical to robots or computers, of co urse: \" . . . even if w e could build a maximally complex computer and keep using it over and over again, this computer will never change.

Even so, as a description of th e u n d e r l ying m e cha- nisms of both organic and cognitive construc- tions — interacting assimilations and accom- modations — the feedback model is h e l p ful, and therefore Piaget intends to use it.\" We can define genesis as a relatively deter mined system o f trans formations comprising a history and leading in a continuous manner from state 3 to state 8, state 8 being more stable than the initial state and' constituting. an extension o f it. For example, in biology, ontogenesis leads to the relatively stable state of adulthood.\" We have discussed ontogeny in C h apter I (see p. 65); it r e l ates to the d evelopmental study of an organism through stages, from conception through in utero ma turation, and after birth, through childhood to adulthood (maturity ). Piaget holds that the course of t his development is on e o f m o v i n g f r o m s tructure to structure, in w h i c h t h e r e i s a formative transition from an unstable, weaker t o a more stable, stronger structure.\" I t i s therefore correct to say that for Piaget, devel- opment is synonymous with progress. We see a heavy biological emphasis in Piaget's theory of development, but this is not precisely an emphasis on the physical matter being transmitted from one h u man genera- tion to the next — like germ plasm, for ex- ample. Though we find Piaget saying in one context that his aim is to \" u n c o ver the psy- chogenetic and biological roots of thought,\"\" in another context he emphasizes that \"knowl- e dge is not predetermined in heredity; it i s not predetermined in the things around us- in knowing things around him the subject al- ways adds to them.\"\" In other words, though human beings have organic structures which undoubtedly have evolved and which are in- fluenced by genetic codes carried by the very protoplasm of parent to offspring, the struc- tures of t h o u ght — knowledge — are not so transmitted. Even though the thought of chil- dren bears a resemblance to the thought of primitive peoples and the thought of adults b ears an identity to the th ought of th e a n - cient Greeks, and so on, this is not proof that we have inherited our thought p r ocesses or Genetic Epistemology as Evoluti onary Rationalism W e can now l oo k i n m o r e d e t ail a t w h a t Piaget means by ge netic epistemology, be- ginning with the dictionary definitions of the two words making up t hi s phrase. The ad- jective genetic refers to the origins, develop- ment, and antecedents of something. For ex- ample, if we were to study the biochemical determinants of hereditary transmission from p arent to child, we w o ul d b e s t u dying t h e genetic code. The noun gene refers to such a determining element in the germ plasm, con- trolling hereditary transmission like this. The noun epistemology r efers to t h e s t u dy o r theory of the nature and grounds of knowl- edge, including such topics as the limits and validity of what we know. Putting these two t erms together, w e c a n u n d e r s tand w h y Piaget defines genetic epistemology as the study of \"both the formation and the mean- ing of knowledge.\"\" Piaget's specific definition of genesi~ com- bines the meanings of antecedents, transfor- mations, and increasing stability, as follows:"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Chapter ll T w o K i n d s o f C o n structive T heories: jean Piaget aiid George A. K e l l y 683 it does our own!\"\" that children are re-enacting a primitive time of the race (ontogeny recapitulating phylog- eny; see p. 65 ). Piaget suggests that quite the reverse is true, because \"since all men, including 'primitive men,' started by being children, childhood th i n k in g p r e ceded the thought of our most distant ancestors just as The study of genetic epistemology must be s een as a scientific study in i t s o w n r i g h t , calling for interdisciplinary contributions but never fully accounted for by r e l ated fields, such as biology. Since, according to Piaget, mind begins its development by interiorizing the structures of the body, it is here that the b iological roots of thought may b e said t o occur. Biology has a contribution to make to genetic epistemology, but it is a vain hope to e xpect that th ought ca n b e e x p l a i ned i n terms of physical matter. Genetic epistemol- ogy teaches that the mind is constructed by its own actions, primitive and u n stable at first, but in time increasingly stabilized, con- served, and reversible — made better and bet- ter, thanks to the actions of the person on the source of knowledge in the environment.

The clay is then baked and in time, a bronze statue is cast, further strengthening the artist's conceptualization. In like fashion, the evolution of mind is an active process of shaping and reshaping knowledge until that stability in abstraction we outlined above is Piaget refers to his style of theorizing as constructivism.

Evolution or development becomes a two-way street, influenced by p h y sical (hereditary ) genesis but also by c o g n i t i v e (behavioral ) genesis. Lower animals construct their physi- cal structures by assimilation and accommo- dation just as higher animals construct their rational cognitive structures by assimilation and accommodation. Piaget's theoretical con- structs can hold \"up and down\" the levels of a nimal evolution. And w hen w e l ook m o r e closely at the constructions of mind, we find Piaget standing against the behavioristic type of explanation in which it is said that mind \"inputs\" schematic structures from reality in ready-made fashion. Though Piaget may use the language of cybernetics in trying to cap- t ure the self-regulatory nature o f h u m a n thinking, he never forgoes that phenorneno- logical insistence upon the mind as having the capacity to organize its ourn schemata. This is why Piaget can say that \"develop- ment is more fundamental than learning\" \"' in the construction of schemata. The person d oes not learn cognitive operations in t h e same way that language is learned. Learning is a concept that characterizes the ongoing equilibrations of the ever-improving schemata over the years.\" There would be no learning possible unless the organism did not already possess this native or innate capacity to struc- ture experience.

Logical reasoning on the other hand reflects the active patterning of this knowledge, quite aside from the specific content that is being ordered and conveyed.\" Even a person reared in the wilds of nature who had never learned a language would reflect a logic in his or her crudely unstable cognitive operations. Hence, j ust as we will no t fin d t h e r o o t s of m i n d exclusively in the p rotoplasm of hereditary transmission, so too will we not find it exclu- sively in the input shapings of sociocultural instructions.

It i s a m i s t ake to b e l ieve t hat because the body suffers from a b i o - c hemical lack, this i n sufficiency can br i n g about behavior. Not until this disequilibrium is both sensed physiologically and oriented toward a goal can we speak of the actions oc- curring as genuine behavior. Behavior is not centered on survival; to the contrary, it has decentered from the aim of \"just getting by\" both to expand the en- vironmental range within w h ich th e o r gan- ism behaves and to facilitate the organism's mastery o f this environment.\" B e havior i s action par excellence. Whether we think of the wild animal roaming through the forest in search of food or the human being coming alive intellectually in going to school, all be- havior moves outwardly to assimilate more and more experience. As long as this mastery occurs without a hitch, we can speak of adap tation or adjustment in the organism's behav- i or.\" In t h i s c a se, equilibration is m o v i n g along nicely as development proceeds. If a dis- equilibrium occurs in behavior, then we can consider this a need o f the organism.\" Th i s term is used when the disequilibration is not severe or chronic. Marie is not presently liked by her peer group in school. As a new student who has just moved into the school district, she has yet to prove herself to the other stu- dents. Marie is direquilibrated and needs to accommodate to the fact that the other chil- dren expect her to do more than simply be polite to them. She has to relate more per- sonally to them, play with them, and reveal herself as a regular person. If she does indeed make this accommodation, Marie's need for acceptance will be resolved. If she does not, if she is for some reason unable to adapt, then her disequilibration will become chronic, and we could refer to M a ri e as ma l a dapted or maladjusted. Personality as a System Thus far we have made it appear that emo- tional schemata do not occur, but this is not true. Piaget uses the term a ffection rather than emotion, but he makes it quite clear that all thinking is shot through with the interests and biases of emotional schemata, and that we must always consider the ongoing actions of affective equilibration in h u m a n b e h a v- i or.\" Affective schemes are harder to g e n - eralize than intellectual schemes. There is an energic quality a b ou t a ff e c t iv e s c h emata, which makes t he m d i s t i n ctively di ff e r ent from the purely structural role intellectual or cognitive schemata play in thoughts.\" ARec- tions get us going and orient our teleonomic behavior in relation to the ends we seek. As Piaget summarizes it: Affectivity is the motor o f any conduct. But affectivity does not modi fy the cognitive structure. Ta (e two school children for ex- ample.

This is what Piaget means by the personality in general — that is, the total system of interrelating schemata and opera- tions thereby which occur across the sensori- motor, intellectual, and a ff e ctive l e v els.'\" Piaget also uses the term pe rsonality mo re specifically to mean a person's character, that i s, the capacity the person has to w i l l f u l l y pursue a valued course o f a c t i o n w h e n t empted to disregard it. W e w i l l r e t ur n t o this specific usage below, when we d i scuss Piaget's theory of development and in partic- ular his self construct (see p. 702). We come now to a problem in the under- standing of Piaget's theory, which stems from the general way in which he uses the concept of construction. In suggesting as he does that there are material (organic ) as well as psycho- logical (cognitive ) constructions, we are left w ith the problem of w o n d ering w ha t p e r - spective to take in thinking about this con- s tructive process. Do we th in k a b out i t a s happening ro the organism (extraspectively; see p. 21 ) > Or do we think of the construc- t ive action as occurring from th e p o in t o f view of the b ehaving organism (introspec- tively ), who brings it to bear in the sense of Binswanger's world-designs (see p. 634) or Kelly's personal constructs (see p. 713) > O ur problem here is l i k e w a t c h ing t h e growth of a tree versus a person, The tree ma- tures and grows branches with leaves which assimilate nourishment from the sun even as the tree's roots assimilate nourishment from the earth. These physical processes may indeed be patterned and active in constructive organ- ization, because trees must accommodate to weather and soil c o n d i tions even as they assimilate nourishment according to already established structures like leaves and roots. But the growing person, who patterns mental operations on the physical constructions of his or her body, is doing so in a different sense. To understand what is taking place, we must necessarily look th r o ugh th e c o g n i t i ons of t he actively constructing intellect in a w a y that is impossible to do in understanding the e quilibrating processes of trees or h u m a n (physical) bodies. We may use a single word like construction to d e scribe both p h y s ical (organic ) and mental (cognitive ) processes of equilibration through the construction of structure, but this does not alter the fact that there are major differences in how we must understand what appears to be taking place. Without denying that both forms of construc- t ion do take place, we are still left with t h i s puzzle. A major difference between trees or bodily physical actions (like digestion ) and what we call the person or personality is, of course, the possibility of self direction i-n behavior. Com- mon sense suggests that people are agents d irecting their behavior, and b y u s in g t h e word teleonomic to describe behavior, Piaget certainly implies that he considers people to be agents. This is a central tenet of the phe- n omenological outlook of Part I I I . A n d y e t , P iaget is no t r e a ll y s y m p athetic w it h a n agency interpretation of human behavior. He does not want t o h y p o statize (make real ) something he considers to be a construction by the person moving from or g a nic to cog- nitive constructions. That is, a s e l f, or cog- nitive sel f, as Piaget sometimes calls i t, is itself a schema framed by operational think- ing. At birth, Piaget believes the baby and the physical environment are not yet differ- entiated, so that there is no sense of I versus the world in th e cognitive processes of the infant.'\" In o r de r t o g ai n s om e sense of a self — a continuity of I-ness — the child must in time come to construct this self-concept, and this can only occur through th e u sual pr o- cesses of assimilation and a c commodation. Earliest thought is said to be egocentric, by which is meant the fact that children cannot d ifferentiate between t h ei r t h o u g h t s a n d"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Tw o K i n d s of C onstructive Theories: J ean Piaget and George A. Kelly 6 8 7 themselves as thinkers nor can t hey g r a sp what is make-believe and what is real, much less the difference between their point of view and the viewpoints of others.\"' The fact that the child's earliest thought is egocentric does not mean that he or she has an ego in the sense suggested by Freud's the- ory. This concept of egocentricity is more the observer's term, applied to the child's cogni- tive style in capturing its essentials. Of course, as already noted, in time children construct a cognitive self-image, a picture of themselves in relation to others. But since this self-con- cept is the result and not the cause of assimi- l ation-accommodation in e q u i l i b r ation, w e have difficulty assigning true agency to the personality of the individual. Construction in assimilation and accommodation leading to equilibrations over childhood maturation take place automatically, even though they are not mechanical in the sense of behavioristic the- ory. It is as if, in describing the processes of self-regulation in feedback and equilibration o r disequilibration, Piaget has kept a t r u e self-directedness out of hi s t h eory w h e ther he intended doing so or not. We can think of a robot as teleonomic in that everything it does — its behavior — is goal oriented. But in achieving its equilibrations, does the robot know that it a s a n i d e n t i t y (self) exists and that it i s carrying forward intentional actions > Obviously not. Robots lack such self-reflexive intelligence even when w e program t h e m t o m a k e s t a t e m e n t s \" sounding\" like t hey ar e a w are of \" t h e m - selves.\" The same can be said of Pi agetian personality theory, particularly in light of the following wherein the term or g ans is used to describe mental equilibration as essentially a mechanism: The organism has special organs o f equi l ibrium. The same is t r u e o f mental li fe, rvhose organs o f equilibrium are special regu latory mechanisms. This is so at all levels o f development, from the eLementary regula tions o f motivation (needs and interests ) up to tviLL for afjectivity and from perceptual and sensorimotor regulations up to operations for cog nit~on. At a more subtle theoretical level, Piaget's attitude regarding the use of anything smack- ing of a finalistic (f inal-cause ) explanation in science is quite negative. For example, in his study of children's understanding of causa- tion, he found again and again that they at- tributed intentions to i n a n i m at e s t r u c tures, so that they would say the sun was causing the rain today much as their mothers might water potted plants. Piaget interprets these a nthropomorphic explanations as no t t r u e causal explanations; that is, he will not accept final causation as a legitimate construct (see p. 5). He pr efers to call such explanations precausal, w hich he interprets as a \"pr i m i - tive\" view of reality in which the person has not yet diRerentiated psychological motiva- tions (a la egocentric thought ) from the nat- ural causation of a scientific form of descrip- tion.\"' Unlike Adler, Piaget does not wish to be considered a theorist who uses finalistic explanations.\"' It is this continuing commit- ment to the traditional explanations of hard science that keeps Piaget fro m i n t r oducing more decidedly teleological concepts into his theory. Behavior is always seated in the inter- acting equilibrations of assimilation and ac- c ommodation wh i ch , a c c ordin g t o b a s i c Piagetian tenets, occurs with or without a self identity in the personality structure.

Food is wanted and mother is not th ere to p rovide it, or a to y i s r eached for but i t i s too far outside the playpen's confining limits to grasp. Each of these frustrating circum- stances serves to focus the child's attention on the reasons for th e d i s equilibration rather than simply on the desired goal (food, toy ). This in turn generates a sense of conscious- ness and as the behaviors of life extend in maturation, a growing sense of consciousness will occur because of the inevitable frustra- tions life brings about. When reasons for the frustration are ex- amined, the child must eventually recognize that something like a self \"over here\" wants to obtain something else \"over there.\" These preliminary schemata are what begin order- ing into a system of what we then call con- sciousness. The self-image therefore parallels d evelopment of consciousness. In line w i t h what we discussed in the pr evious section, Piaget does not really place much emphasis on the role of consciousness in behavior. He does not believe that consciousness is an essen- tial focus of concern for psychology because: \" . .. the task of psychology is not the explana- tion of the working of the nervous system in terms of consciousness of behaviour, but rather the analysis of the evolution of b e haviour. That is to say, the way in which a perception, for example, depends on past perceptions and conditions subsequent ones.\" \"' Piaget rejects psychoanalytical interpreta- tions of un c o nscious symbolism, believing that Freud confused the contents of symbols with the primitive, egocentric schemata that children were constructing when they framed these so-called symbols.'\" Indeed, Piaget pre- sented a paper on this very point at the 1922 conference of the International Psychoanalyti- cal Association,\"' at w h ich F r eud was pres- ent. Piaget argued that his studies found all c hildish thinking t o b e s y n c retic and p r e - logical, and therefore so-called unconscious symbols could be found i n a c h i l d ' s s t ate- ments even while awake. Piaget views the symbol as a special form of scheme, in which the signi fier (name of a thing ) has been dif- ferentiated from t h e o b j e ct s i g n i fied (the thing named ).\"' When t his occurs, the per- son uses the object as a means of symbolic adaptation to reality. For example, Monique might use a little box to symbolize a cat in her play. She has differentiated the image of t he thing we c all a b o x (signified object ) from the word box (signifier ) and can now use the former as a symbol for a cat walking a cross the Hoor. Piaget woul d c al l t h i s a primary symbol because Monique is conscious of her playful representation.\"' H owever, in a n o t he r c o n t e xt , M o n i q u e might employ a secondary symbo/, in which case she would be unconscious of its role in her behavior. Assume that Monique had been made jealous by the birth of a younger sister and is playing one day with two dolls of un- e qual size. In h e r p l a y , w e o b s e rv e t h a t Monique has the smaller doll go away on a long journey while the larger doll stays home with mother (Monique may pretend that she is mother ) . The larger doll may then be made to pet the cat as represented by the box, dem- onstrating as Piaget contends that conscious and unconscious thought goes on side by side. The distinction between conscious and un - conscious behavior is always a matter of de- g ree, and consequently, it is a lso t ru e t h a t \"symbols cannot be classified once and for all as either primary or secondary.\" \"' As for the Freudian construct of re p res"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i n d s of C onstructive Theories: Jean Piaget and George A. Kelly 689 sion, Piaget would say that this occurs when the person refuses to accept what reality de- mands in the way of an accommodation and persists in assimilating reality to an egocen- tric schema which is unadaptive. For exam- ple, Marcel soon learns upon going to school that he can no longer have things entirely his own (egocentric ) way. H e cannot always have first turn in k i c k ing a. soccer ball, but m ust share this advantage wit h t h e o t h e r boys. If he does not accommodate to this de- mand of reality, but instead loses interest in soccer and begins to occupy his time in bully- ing younger children on the playground, pre- tending egocentrically that he has real leader- ship ability and even popularity, we would witness a case of r e pression taking p l ace. Piaget does not see why we need to believe there is a censor within th e p ersonality to understand such unconscious behavior. The dynamics are clear enough. \"A repressed ten- dency is by definition deprived of accommo- d ation, and therefore dissociated from t h e conscious ego. If, in spite of this, it seeks sup- port, it can only be by way of egocentric and unconscious assimilation, i.e., by means of a symbolic substitute.\" \"' Another type of unconsciousness that may be seen in behavior stems from the fact that cognitive operations are based on p h ysical constructions, and the latter may be at work without benefit of the former. Children will often know something in action as a sensori motor kind of in t eLLigence, yet not know it cognitively in awareness.\"' Andrea, a kinder- gartner, has outstanding ability to jump rope. She has a knack of moving into and leaving the rope area which ensures that she will al- m ost never be caught by it, no m a t ter h o w quickly it is rotated by the other girls. An- drea is unable to describe her technique of rope-skipping because she is totally unaware of the fact that she has one. Her behavior has been constructed at th e sensorimotor level, but it has not ye t b een m ade operational. When it is, Andrea will be able to offer an o pinion on w ha t sh e d oes to a v oi d b e i n g caught by the rope. Such \"unconscious\" sen- sorimotor learnings take place in adulthood as well, although they do not represent nearly the proportion of total behavior that they do in childhood. Sometimes the course of learning is in the opposite direction from operational thought to sensorimotor construction. Driving an automobile is a case in point. At first, we learn by concentrating on every move, but in time, as sensorimotor intelligence (motoric construction ) takes over, we are able to drive the automobile without really thinking about P iaget is d i s t r ustful o f t h e a n a l y t i c a l method of discovery and proof, w h ereby a patient recalls past occurrences and assumes that they are true.

It was not u n t i l h e w a s fifteen years old that his former nurse wrote to his parents and confessed that the story was a hoax, made up to account for some scratches on Piaget's forehead which occurred because she had been derelict in her nur sing duties.

Memory is an active reconstruction, bringing alive past con- structions into ever-new constructions.\"' Piaget views the dream as comparable to symbolic play, but with the additional proviso that the self or ego consciousness is lost.\"' Games are m o r e d e l i b e r ately c o n t r olled, whereas dreams carry the person beyond the p oint to w h i c h c o n sciousness would or d i - n arily want to go . A l m ost anything i s f a i r game to the dream. Piaget does not object to the view that dreams may be >nish fulfil/ ments, as long as we appreciate that a wish is nothing more than the person's effort to as- similate reality to the self or the ego (the two terms mean roughly the same thing ). Wish- ing is lik e h o p in g t h a t s o m ething desired really will happen, and in d r eams we occa- sionally pretend that these desired goals really d'o happen. In certain cases, those accommo- dations that have been turned aside as so- called repressions may turn up a s assimila- tions in the dream. Marcel might dream that he and only he i s k i c k in g t h e s o ccer ball a round the pl ayground as th e o t he r b o y s w atch and applaud his skill.

I n e a c h o f t h e s e r e s e arches, Piaget may be seen breaking development down into a series of stages and substages, ranging usually from three to six in number. Piaget insists that before we speak of a stage of deveLopment, four characteristics must be evident: (I) there must be a c o n stant and orderly succession of acquired behaviors over time; (2) an integration of t h ese behaviors must take place across succeeding levels; (3) this integration must have the quality of a completion of earlier development but also a preparation for further development; and (4) there must be a sense of totality as a whole structure rather than there being simply piece- meal or minor changes taking place.\"' Keep- ing these criteria in mi nd, w e can consider Piaget's overall theory which can be said to have three major periods of development- infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Child- h ood is broken down i n t o e a rl y an d l a t e r stages so that on occasion, students of Piaget will refer to his developmental theory as con- taining four major stages.\"' The main point for our purposes is to catch the continuing flow of action across the three or four levels o f development to which we now tu r n . Infancy: Birth to Age Tu ro Years This first major stage of l if e i s s o m etimes called the prelanguage period, and it c o ul d be broken down into as many as six substages if we wanted to follow each specific nuance. We will, however, follow the drift of Piaget's explanations of his experiments in terms of three succeeding substages which he has on occasion used in his writings to capture the main characteristics of infancy. Keep in mind that at each level equilibration and (physical) construction is taking place.

Piaget notes that considered mentally, for the infant \"the world is essen- tially a thing to be sucked.\"'\" S u c k in g ac- tion is therefore used schematically to assimi- late other objects to it, such as the thumb in place of mother's breast, and so on. There is no proper mental life going on in this period, because only the basic motor schemata are active. Of course, as Piaget reminds us, the reflex is the \"forerunner of mental assimila- tion\" '\" because the mind will be patterned on such structures as constructions move from the organic to the cognitive. Every realm o f sensorimotor re flex organi zation is the scene o f particular assimilations extending. . . physicochemical assimilation ... [a n dI t h e se behavior patterns, inasmuch as they are gra fted on hereditary tendencies, from the very beginning find themselves in- serted in the general frametvorlt o f the indi vidual organization [that is, organic scheme ]; that is to ray, be fore any acquisition of con s ciousness, they enter i n t o t h e functional totality which the organism constitutes.'\" Organization o f Percepts and Habits. Gr a d- ually, the child learns to t h u m b-suck in a more systematic way and also to turn his or her head in the direction of a sound. From a bout the fi ft h w e e k o n , c h i l d r e n b e g i n smiling in response to interpersonal prompts f rom their parents, and in time during th i s substage, the child will come to recognize cer- tain persons as distinct from o t h ers. Piaget calls the equilibrating assimilations and ac- commodations taking place over these early months of l ife r e flex cycles.'\" Such r eflex cycles will develop into circular reactions be- cause the child develops an interest in some activity and repeats it automatically. Thus, the infant of a few months of age finds that the head-turning action is workable and be- gins repeating it; or the child may look about to recognize people again and again. Piaget calls such beginning practice of actions based on reflexive patternings reproductive assimi lation,'\" be cause in reproducing the action, the child is assimilating the environment to it in an active way — as well as accommodating for environmental changes. For example, the child learns that head-turning is easier to do in some positions rather than others only be- cause of the effort he or she has given to repro- d uctive assimilation in t h e fi r s t p l a c e . I n p racticing looking a t p e o pl e an d t h e n a t things in general, the child comes to organize percept' (things seen ), and the pr actice of actions like head-turning lead to stable man- until about nine months that children begin actively looking for specific percepts like a nerisms of behavior called habits. I t is n o t rattle on which to center attention. Sensorimotor Intelligence. T he c h i ld in t h e second year of life is sometimes said to be living in a period of practical intell'gence be- c ause he or she knows th i ngs w i t h out y e t having internal thoughts.\"' That is, the child through circular reactions is continually ex- panding his or her r ange of u n d erstanding concerning how the world is patterned, how hands work and where the mouth is located, and so forth. All such schemata are diReren- tiated completely at the level of organic con- struction. Piaget refers to the structures of this period as action schemata because they are all based on the active manipulation of objects rather than on the use of words or concepts. For example, at about the age o f e i g h teen months, children are able to grasp a stick and use it to draw a toy toward themselves which had been placed out of reach.'\" Children have no operations (words or mental concepts ) to"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Part IlI 692 Kantian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook use in reasoning through such coordinated movements, but rely totally on sensorimotor action schemata. In addition, this stage of development re- flects what Piaget has called reciprocal assim ilation, by which he means a form of coordi- nation that takes place among the separate action schemata of the child. For example, a baby presented tvith a neu object successively incorporates it into each of his \"action schemata\" (shallying it, strolling it, balancing it, etc. ), as though he could come t o itnotv the object by perceiving hotv it i s used... . I t i s n a t u r al, then, that these vari- ous acts'on schemata should become assimi- lated tvith one another, i e., coordin.ated so that some serve as a goal for action as a tvhole, while others serve as a means.'\" There is no differentiation of a self at this time of life, so everything the baby perceives is centered on himself or herself. Psychoanaly- sis has called this the period of na r c issism. P iaget says he would not quarrel wit h t h i s designation, as long as it is appreciated that this is a \" n a rcissism without N a r cissus\"'\" because the child has no personal awareness at all. Whereas Freud placed ego identity in the unconscious, for Piaget egocentricity early what will later be termed self-identity. Like most of the phenomenological-existentialistic theorists, Piaget places emphasis on conscious- ness in the workings of what are often called the higher mental processes. Lower, automatic, sensorimotor \"mental\" habits of the sort we w itness in in f ancy ar e n o t h in g l i k e w h a t Freud believed took p l ace, because opera- tional thought has not yet e v olved (devel- oped). There really is no mind in t ha t self- reflexive sense of reasoning around things, structed. trying to g e t o n e ' s w i s h e s e x p r essed or enacted through strategies like the parapraxes (Freudian slips ), until a fter op e rational thought begins. It is out of the centering of narcissism (on our own person ) that the next stage of de- velopment becomes possible. Because the c hild does indeed consider his or he r o w n bodily processes (satisfactions, activities, and so on ) as being everything in life, there is a natural tendency to focus on them and repro- duce them. Building on natural-reflex cycles, this narcissistic egocentricity will in time lead to constructions of what in the next stage of development we will call the concrete opera- t ions. This occurs by interiorizing th e p a t - terns of reflex cycles through assimilation and then by way o f f u r t h e r c i r c u la r r e actions, e volving the basis for thought itself. In t h e second half of the first year of l i fe, children begin to imitate the actions of others. These imitations are all of the physical variety, of course, such as reaching for what others are holding, opening the mouth when parents do, and so on. In this way, sensorimotor intelli- gence widens as the child i s c r e a ting an d r eciprocally assimilating m o r e a n d m o r e schemata to the ongoing store already con- By the end of the second year of life, the child has evolved four important action sche- mata which form the basis of se nsorimotor intelligence: (1) a sense of the distribution of surrounding space; (2) the perception of ob- jects (including the body ) in this space; (3) a notion of causal sequence in which some- thing brings something else about; and (4) a b eginning sense of t i m e ' s p a s sage.'\" T o know that objects exist, the child must first grasp the idea of permanence.

To realize that ob- jects can be nearer or farther away from our b odies is essential to our g etting w ha t w e want or avoiding what we do not want. Cau- sality is linked first of al l w i t h t h e c h i l d s own egocentricity. Children naturally assume that everything that happens does so because of the same motives we all have in wanting to satisfy our needs. We shall return to this point below. Finally, children have some idea of delay, waiting, happening, and all similar states that we associate with the passage of time. Early Chi7dhood: From Ages Turbo to Seven Years' Piaget has discussed this major substage in l ight of four topics, and we will f o l low h i s coloring pictures, and as they j abber away in what Piaget calls a collective monologue,\"' real ideas are not being conveyed or exchanged, even though each individual participant seems to believe that he or she understands and is being understood by others. In time this inter- personal jabbering will mature into t rue so- cial relations, but in early childhood it is dif- f icult to see how language inputs from t h e environment have much eRect on actual be- havior. The Genesis o f Thought. Pi a g et r e fers to early childhood as a preoperational stage in t he development of thought.\" ' T h i s m e a n s that there is not yet complete interiorization achieved in the patterning of o r g anic sche- mata to mental levels of schematization. In essence, early childhood is a transitional and preparatory substage during which the child is moving from complete reliance on sensori- motor intelligence to the beginnings of opera- tional intelligence. This does not begin until about age seven when use is made of concrete operations. \"We will call concrete operations those [whichI we bea.r on manipulable ob- jects (eRective or immediately im agineable manipulations ), in contrast to operations bearing on propositions.\" \"' We cannot really consider early childhood to be a tr ul y o p erational substage because, though preliminary schemata are being grad- ually interiorized, they are not yet reversible, so they cannot be used to actively think one' s way from point A to B and back again. The child's grasp of reality remains narrow and rigid, even though steps are being taken in the right direction by interiorizing the action schemata of sensorimotor intelligence through circular reactions. This often occurs during play. For example, the child may facilitate in- teriorization of schemas of motions, such as breakdown. Socialization o f Action. Ea r ly childhood re- flects the groping beginnings of social life, even though as we shall see there is no real interpersonal action taking place in much of what the child does. By age two, children are conversing with some regularity so that par- ents are in constant verbal communication with them. Imitation is facilitated by such ex- changes, as the child tries to talk like and be like mother and father. Piaget refers to the parental and other adult models as ego icieals f or the child.\"' B u t t h e b a sic tenor of l i f e during early childhood remains that of ego- centricity. Children still do not h ave a self- awareness, although it will begin to be laid down during this preparatory period. In his studies of l a n g u age d e v elopment, P i aget found that until the age of seven years, chil- dren scarcely know how to have a discussion among themselves. They speak as if playing at words in a way that has no real focus on communicating ideas to another person.

It i s i m p o ssible in p r i n c i p le f o r them to be understood. Children at this level cannot understand cause-eRect in the abstract way required to explain rain or the workings of gravity. As we noted in a previous section (see p. 687), Piaget defines precausality as a primitive structural relation \"in which causa- tion still bears the marks of quasi-psychologi- cal motivation.\"\"' I n o t h e r w o rds, what the child wants to hear from us is that the sun made the rain fall or the marble rolls because it is fun to roll. Such anthropomorphic explanations can be assimilated to the child's schemata because this is how he or sh e egocentrically under- stands the world. The child can make water spill by toppling over a glass, and it is cer- tainly true that rolling down a slope is fun to do. This belief that inanimate things like the sun or a marble have intentions like we do is called childhood a nimism, which is a n - other way of referring to the general question of. anthropomorphization (see p. 11). Piaget notes that most children at this age \". .. are p ractically unanimous in believing that t h e moon accompanies them on a walk, and their e gocentricity impedes them f ro m t h i n k i n g what the moon would do in the presence of people strolling in the opposite direction.\"\"' Along with believing in the humanlike (an- thropomorphic ) nature of p h y s i cal r eality, c hildren also assume that e v erything t h a t takes place has a point to it, an end (Pna/ism) or a purpose which must be accepted as a kind of moral law. In f a ct, no di stinction is drawn between natural and moral l aws, so t he child assumes that what occurs in t h e world should occur, because mother, father, other important adults, or God made things the way they are and that is how they should always be. Children cannot abstract, so they never u nderstand the spirit of a l a w , b u t a l w a y s demand that the letter of the law be observed. This is termed moral realism, a tendency we see merging late in this substage at about six years o f age and carrying o ve r i n t o l a t e r childhood: \".. . m o r a l realism induces an ob- j ective conception of responsibility. . . . F o r since he takes rules literally and t h i nk s of good only in t erms of o bedience, the child will at fi rst ev aluate acts not in a c cordance with the motive that has prompted them but in terms of their exact conformity with estab- lished rules.\" \"' The combined eRect of pre- causality, childhood animism, and moral re- a lism on the psychology of th e c h il d i s t o present a world of intentional beings and ob- jects, all focusing on the child, doing things for the child, and yet conforming to a set of rules that have no special justification but exist merely to be obeyed. Out of t hi s ego- centric and literal grasp of reality the child constructs a series of schemata, which is un- stable and poorly systematized at first; but the very simplicity and rigidity of such prelimi- nary understandings ensures that a stable pat- tern will eventually be interiorized as child- hood is lived through."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i n d s of Constructive Theories: Jean Piaget and George A.

In some of his earlier writings, Piaget referred to the f irst efforts at o p e rational thought d u r i n g early childhood as intuitive reasoning or sim- ply intuition. H e d e f in ed t h i s c o n c ept a s follows: \"Primary intuition is no more than a sensorimotor [action ] schema transposed into an act of thought so that it naturally inherits t he ch aracteristics o f t h e sensorimotor schema.\"\"' For example, a child of four or five years may be shown a series of eight blue discs aligned in a row w it h l i t tl e spaces be- tween each, and then be asked to reproduce the series by selecting red discs from a pile. T he child w il l i n t u i t i v ely construct an a r - rangement of red discs in a row of exactly the same length as the blue discs but w i t h out bothering to keep the number of discs iden- tical and without considering the matter of spacing between discs.\"' Pi aget points out that this child has thought of the task solely in terms of q u antity, that is, of t h e s p a ce occupied as a unit by the blue series in the perceptual field. It is as if a global impression as an action scheme is taken over uncritically and used whole hog without accommodation. A more detailed examination of the task would have required the child to reason with r eversibility. That is, the child w o ul d h a v e needed to mull the task over, looking at it from different perceptual angles (\" Let's see, what is that blue bunch really like> Is it just those discs all together or is t h ere another thing about them>\" ) and asking questions once a copy had been made (\"Now, is the red bunch just like the blue bunch > How are they alike and are they diRerent at all >\" ), and so on. This more abstract reversibility in rea- soning has yet to be constructed by the child. Piaget first called al l s u c h p r e o perational thought intuition, but as he did further work, he began to see that there was a certain de- gree of half logic (half operationality ) in these crude understandings, and in time, he called this semilogic.\"' He r e is a n o t her ex- ample: Paul, a five-year-old boy, has a brother Etienne, and when asked, he correctly states that he ( Paul) has a brother, but E t i e n ne does not. The semilogic reflected here is in Paul's premise that \"one boy plus a brother m akes two.\" Hence, as there are only t w o children in the family and Paul is unable to reverse perspectives, if he has th e br o t h e r, then Etienne cannot.'\"' Thanks to Paul's ego- centricity, the concept of \"brother\" can mean only \"in relation to me.\" AIjectivity and' Expanding Motivations. A f - fectivity continues its maturation along with t he development o f s e m i l o g i cal t h o u g h t . Piaget places emotions on a par with strictly i ntellectual cognition, as follows: \" T h ere i s never a purely intellectual action, and numer- ous emotions, interests, values, impressions of harmony, etc., intervene Lwith each other ]- for example, in the solving of a mathematical p roblem. Likewise, there is never a p u r e ly affective act, e.g., love presupposes compre- hension.\" \"' T h e r e a r e m a n y c h a l l e n ging sources of affection at this time of life, sources that create the chsequilibria of needs and mo- tivate the child to restore equilibrium — which in turn spurs fu r ther developmen t because this is never a matter of settling t h i ngs or quieting them down. With every need met, a f urther step is taken along the r oad of l i f e bringing on the possibility of f u r t her needs being generated.

Ordinarily, there is no problem here in most families because children at this stage are quite literal in accepting whatever the adult wishes, often taking via moral re- alism each parental request or show of inter- est as a command. Feelings of dislike occur when the child comes into conflict with th e values of others, and sometimes this arises from the unusually high standards generated b y moral realism. A c h il d o f s i x o r s e v e n might severely criticize a younger sibling for not following s om e h o m e r u l e — such as wiping one's shoes before entering the family dwelling — and generates considerable inter- p ersonal hostility i n t h e p r o c e ss . S l i g h t changes in familiar patterns during this age may provoke anxiety in the child, who much prefers keeping the world as it is. Along with e njoying the same fairy t al e t ol d t o t h e m night after night, children like to h ave th e same routine followed on special occasions, such as holidays or birthdays. It is as if th e predictable routine of t h ese events is reas- s uring, something to be l o oked forward t o and counted on as completely known and Near the end of early childhood, an im- p ortant aRective event takes place in wh at Piaget calls the act of sel f evaluation.\"' -This r efers to the r e l ative feelings of. wort h a child senses in relation to his or her emerging i dentity and touches upon what A d ler w a s getting at in his constructs of inferiority or superiority feelings. As the child is beginning t o frame som e u n d e rstanding o f a s e l f , moving to later childhood where this sense of identity will be even more important, it is essential that a proper equilibration occur in relation to m a s tering e n v ironmental chal- lenges of both an i n t erpersonal and imper- s onal nature. In a d d i tion t o g e t t in g a l o n g avoided. Seven to Ttvelve with others, children must feel competent to dress themselves, handle their food utensils, color with a crayon, and so on.

Some of u s f o r m higher opinions of ourselves, some lower, but a s long as they meet r eality, t hi s i s a s i t should be. Sometimes, however, children get distorted pictures of themselves.

The practice of internal discussion is helpful in resolving interpersonal disagreements, because each child can now see that there is more than one outlook on a question. Whether to play a game following one set of rules or another set can be negotiated and changed if neces- sary to meet the needs of all participants. By and large, children tend to cooperate at this stage of life because in many cases a logic o f fairness is suggested.'\" By p l e ading fo r fairness, most children in later childhood can influence the course of a disagreement as long as a good case can be made for what they are r ecommending to their pl aymates.

Piaget and h i s c o l l e a gues con- ducted numerous experiments to establish the fact that reversibility emerges in late child- hood. These studies are called conservation experiments, because what they aim to fin d out is whether a. child can grasp that quality of change within stability (permanence ) that typifies the more abstract schemata (see p. 680). Can the child appreciate that concepts l ike mass an d w e i g h t a r e c o n s t an t e v e n though we manipulate their percei vea appear- ance by pouring liquids from g l ass to glass or slice wholes into portions> For example, a.ssume that we have two identical glasses, A a nd B. B r i d get, a f o u r - year-old g i rl , a n d Annette, a seven-year-old girl, are both asked to place equal numbers (a dozen or so ) of blue beads in glass A and red beads in glass B . We next ask both girls to pour th e b l u e b eads from glass A into g l ass C, w h ich i s taller and narrower so that the level of beads is stretched out in glass C, thanks to its more t ubelike shape. Even t h o u g h t h e y h a v e p oured the blue beads from A. to C t h e m - selves, when asked which glass, B or C, now h as more beads, Bridget will say C and An - nette will say that neither has.'\" Annette has constructed a stable concep- tion of volume (schema ) to interrelate with her conception of shape (schema), enabling h er to abstract operationally and n o t r e l y solely on what is seen (perceived ) but on what is hnotvn. Bridget is still very concrete in operational thought, more sensorimotor in her schematic understanding, so that she can- n ot abstract conceptions like v o l u m e a n d shape but must instead report what she sees (perceives in a literal sense ). And what she l iterally sees is one glass much t aller t h an another with beads piled in it a l m ost to the top, whereas the shorter glass is not n early so filled up. Annette is able to take her think- ing forward from the original comparison of glasses A and B and then bring it back after w e have manipulated her v i s ua l fi el d b y bringing in glass C.

The Rational Operations: Concreteness. As s oon as a child s i n t u i tion o r s e m i l ogic i s transformed into reversible thought, we can begin speaking about true operations taking place. Piaget explicitly states that the age of seven or eight is th e p o in t w h ere co ncrete operations erst appear.'\" This means that in late childhood we still wi tness schematic or- ganizations which relate to manipulable things rather than to abstractions. The average child cannot therefore follow discussions in which hypothetical or r e l ativistic propositions are being considered. It w o ul d b e p o i n t l ess to make a list of th e c o ncrete operations em- ployed during t hi s stage. Almost anything relating to thought or cognition is an opera- tion. About the only distinction we see Piaget making is that of separating affective opera- tions from what w e m i g h t c al l i n t e l lectual operations. The main point needing emphasis is that rational thought is evolving, maturing, developing, but it is doing this in an actively constructive fashion. A distinctive feature of rational thought is that it takes two in i tially separate schemata and combines or groups them to create a new structure. This constructive process of. group ing is essential to the development of rational thought, to the creation of even more stable- hence abstract — cognitive operations. Group- ing also includes the processes of reversibility, of course. Indeed, four characteristics o f groupi ng are necessary preliminaries fo r further evolution of rational (logical) think- ing in the child. Using mathematical exam- ples, Piaget summarizes these four character- We may draw a general conclusion: a chiLd' s thin ( ing becomes logical only t h r o ugh t h e organization o f systems o f operations which obey the laus common to all groupings: (1) Composition: taro operations may combine to give another operation o f the grouping (e. g., +1 +1 = +2). (2) Reversibility: every operation can be inverted (e. g., +1 becomes inverted to — 1 ). (9) The a'irect operation and its inverse gives rise to an id'entical or null operation (e. g., +1 — 1 = 0 ). (0) Operations c an combine with one another in a l l (inds of ways.\"' Once these four c h aracteristics have been c onstructed, the child w il l b e m o v i n g i n t o the higher-level cognitive operations of ado- lescence and adulthood. A fjectivity in Morality and Wi l l ful Behavior. T he gradual loss of e g ocentricity i n l a t e r childhood has great relevance for the develop- ment of m o r ality. P i aget d i stinguishes be- tween the mo r aLity o f constraint a nd t h e morality o f cooperation.\" Al l m o r a l i t y, a c- cording to Piaget, \"consists in a system of rules,\" \"' and hence this morality distinction has to do with how children look at the fol- lowing of rules. As we h ave seen, in early childhood, moral realism rests upon a literal rule-following pattern in which the child feels constrained to behave as expected simply be- cause \"that's the way it is.\" The world is set up with strict laws and the child follows them as understood without regard for t h eir (ab- stract ) rationale. This morality of constraint begins to give way to a morality of coopera- tion in later childhood, as the growth of re- versibility in thought makes it better under- stood that things are not always \"p recisely so\" or that the natural order of lawfulness is n ot identical with a m o r a l o r d e r o f h o w things \"ought\" to be in every case. Piaget has conducted m an y i n t e r esting s tudies on r u l e -following b e h avior. U s i n g istics as follows:"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i n d s of Constructive Theories: Jean Piaget and George A. Kelly 699 games like marbles, he has shown that young children find it u p setting to be arbitrary in following rules once they have been learned. \"For very young children, a rule is a sacred reality because it is traditional; for the older ones it depends upon mutual agreement.\"'\" Younger children also are much harsher in assigning punishment to those who break the rules. They seem to want to emphasize the punishment for its own sake, whereas older c hildren use punishment more to show th e transgressor that a bond has been broken be- tween people when a wrongdoing takes place. Piaget's value system considers rule by co- operation a more satisfactory equilibration in human relations than rule by authority. In o rder for a r ul e t o w o r k w i t h o u t a u t h o r i t y pressures, there must be feelings of mutual respect among the persons who subscribe to the rule.'\" T hi s necessarily brings aRectivity into considerations of morality. Authoritarian constraint rules through feelings of anxiety and fear, but w h e n m u t u a l r e s pect exists among people, a morality of cooperation can occur. Just as logic is the sum of rules that intelligence makes use of to control behav- ior, so too is morality the sum of r u les that o ur aRective life m a kes use of t o c o n t r o l behavior.'\" ARections (emotions ) are therefore closely aligned with self control, filling -thereby not only an energizing but a selective role in be- h avior. We d o t h i n g s t h a t m a k e u s f e e l pleasant or good (including morally good ) and avoid things that make us feel unpleasant or bad. ARective operations are therefore im- portant to self-emergence and willful behavior because: i s linked to th e functioning o f the autono mous moral feelings, uhich is tvhy tve have t vaited until t h i s [late childh-ood ] stage to d2SCASS 2t.

Will is therefore an opera- tion that permits reversibility to take place in returning fleeting interest values that arise as feelings of pleasure (watching television ) to their proper place lower i n t h e s y stematic hierarchy of values (studies come first ). The will w a its on tw o i m p o r t ant earlier developments to occur: (l) seLf-identity must begin, because intentional behavior is impos- sible without self-awareness; '\" and (2) dis- equilibrations in the form of mo r aL con fiicts must arise. Thus, as we notecl earlier when discussing Piaget's reticence concerning final- ism (see p. 686 ), even though he describes behavior as teleonomic,'\" this does not mean it is thought of as being under freely intended direction by the individual. Self-identity and intentionality in b e havior are l ate-born de- velopments that spring from earlier (uncon- scious, reflexive ) equilibrations and the r e - sultant constructions which were fashioned concerning the self and others. In the final analysis, there is a kind of impersonal evolu- tionary flow to behavioral events which carry them from origins in bodily patterns to the a bstractions of h i g h -level th ought w i t h o u t b enefit of selfhood, although l ater i n l i f e when a self-image has been constructed, this contributes to the forward-moving, improv- ing, evolutionary process. similating it t o o n g o in g schemata, there is a \"characteristic affective coloration\" '\"- namely, a preoccupation with emotional dis- play and heterosexual contacts. There are also dramatic changes taking place in operational thought. We will consider these two sides to the adolescent's experience, beginning wit h the intellectual and moving to the affectional. The FormaL Operations o f Mature Thought. Beginning sometime between eleven and thir- teen years of age, we witness the developing person beginning to u se formaL operations, which means that he o r sh e e m p l oys \"the form of general ideas and abstract construc- tions\" '\" rather than relying on th e p ercep- tion and /or manipulation of concrete objects. Adolescents can therefore begin taking an in- terest in problems that are totally removed from everyday reality. We might say that ado- l escence is the period of l if e i n w h i c h t h e - orizing is born. \"Formal thought is 'hypothet- i co-deductive,' in the sense that i t p e r m i t s one to draw conclusions from pure hypotheses and not merely from actual observations.\" '\" All of th e t y p i cal adolescent characteristics the Freudians and others have explained as sublimations of sexuality — intellectualism, de- sire to improve the w o r ld, asceticism, reli- giosity, a nd so on — are reflections of t h i s n ewly evolved ability to \" t h in k a b ou t c o n - ceptual thought\" and not merely to deal with concrete reality. Adolescents can see what \"is\" and aspire to achieve what \"rrught be\" b e- cause their thinking is no longer \"practical\"; indeed, it is often idealistically impractical. Formal operations of abstract thought are like concrete operations in the sense of re- v ersibility and a logical ordering of w hat i s understood in th eir u se. Bu t i n r e a s oning formally, reversibility moves up a n o tch, so that now the person can be more ar bitrary and consider not only alternative courses of action but also the advisability of p u r suing alternatives in the first place.

The person can think about the form hi s t h ought is taking as a series of propositions, so that rather than merely planning a course of action, he or she can frame a \"representation of a representa- tion of possible action.\" \"' W he n w e r eason propositionally, we are essentially taking an \"as if\" or a \" l e t ' s assume\" or even a \" l e t ' s pretend\" attitude about the most stable struc- tures of our perceived experience. In order for Einstein to challenge concepts like time and space, he had to t h in k a b out assump- tions, about how physicists before him had affirmed unchallenged p r emises (proposi- tions ) regarding their study. It i s t h i s k e y ability for self-reflexivity that truly separates formal from c o n crete operational thought. \"Formal operations engender a 'logic of prop- ositions' in contrast to the logic of relations, classes, and numbers engendered by concrete operations. In his later writings, Piaget was to refer t o this capacity of thought to p air o R c o n- trasting or conflicting propositions as a dialec tica/ form of reasoning (see p. 9). However, when he did so, he was usually referring to the developmental synthesis to be achieved, so that his conception of di alectical mental processes is tied closely to his idea of progress in thought achieved by resolving diRerences and moving ahead to a new level. Thus, we do not find Piaget referring to the contradic- tory style of thought used by children up to ages seven or eight as dialectical, presumably b ecause no synthesis is a c hieved m o v i n g thinking as a constructive process along.\"' Dialectic should be reflected in the progres- sive flow of events, events that do not move in a linear fashion but evolve to higher levels nonetheless. Piaget says, \" . . . dialectic over a nd over again substitutes 'spirals' for t h e linear or 'tree' models with which we start, and these famous spirals or non-vicious circles are very much like the genetic or interactions characteristic of growth.\"\" ' A s w e s h all see below in t hi s c h apter (see p. 713), Kelly frames his process of construction as a di a- lectical understanding of how two i t ems are alike and yet contrasted oppositionally to a third; but he does not relate this process to a developmental progress, to higher and higher levels of structured thought. Piaget, on the other hand, seems to place construction at the heart of the evolutionary process, as in eRect bringing about dialectical advance. \"It is often construction itself which begets the negations along with the affirma- tions, and the syntheses whereby they are ren- in logical or mathematical reasoning, wherein dialectic is reflected as a \"construction by negation.\" '\" Di alectic allows the developing person t o abstract: by u n d erstanding th at whatever he or she is thinking about, alter- native meanings are generated by the oppo- sites suggested. Believing that \"My neighbor- hood is the best one in the whole city\" may be accepted quite literally by th e c h ild r e a- soning according to concrete operations. But with forrnal operations, the child begins to understand that this is simply a statement of opinion, one needing support and j u stifica- tion in some manner, and that it s v a l i dity might depend on the grounds we arbitrarily select to judge this blanket statement. There is a decentering in such a self-reflexive exami- nation, a loss in the authoritative conclusion which was reached. But i n u n d e r standing things this way, the c h il d n e cessarily con- structs a higher-order schemata, form, and so on, making possible a much broader and more sophisticated grasp of what knowledge is all about. Thus it is that dialectic must be seen as essential to the equilibrating p r ocess of assimilation-accommodation, reversibility, and so on: \".. . t h e d i a l ectical attitude seems es- sential to the full wor k ing out of s t r u ctures; dered coherent as well.\"\" ' W e c a n see this"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Part III 702 Ka n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook d ialectic is both complementary to and i n - separable from an alytic, even f o r m alizing, reason.\" \"' Even though egocentricity i n t h e c h i l d - hood sense is over by adolescence, we should not get the idea that it stops occurring during this period, or even later in life for that mat- ter. Egocentricity is a certain style of thought people use — predominantly in early life, but later as well. Adolescent egocentricity is re- flected in the often simplistic schemes young a dults have for improving the world. T h ey have their point of v i ew , and even though they are capable of seeing alternatives, they may decide with gr eat genuineness and /or arrogance that this is the only answer to the problem at hand. As Piaget says, \"Adolescent e gocentricity is manifested by belief in t h e omnipotence of reflection, as though the world should submit i t s elf t o i d e a l i stic schemes rather than to systems of reality.\"'\" A c c orn- modation is called for here, and in time with i ncreasing experience, the young adult w i l l gradually achieve an equilibration between his or her formal thought and th e r ealistic possibilities of reality. Even so, there are times when the exuberance of adolescence effects a significant change in society, Young people have made important contributions by think- i ng the un t h i nkable or b y s e r v in g a s t h e conscience of their country to bring about a change in its national policy. Affectivity as Personality in A d u l t S o c iety. Paralleling the evolution of formal operations in thought, Piaget sees a rise in adolescent affectivity in th e c o m pletion of p e rsonality a nd its injection into adult society.\" W e a r e now considering personality in the more spe- cific (nonsystematic ) sense referred to above (see p. 686). Personality began to emerge in middle to l ate ch i l dhood (eight to tw elve years ) along with th e d e velopment of w i l l and the formation of a value system. Piaget draws a distinction between the sel f and the personality in overall behavior. The self is a more primitive aspect of the person, so that it is closer to egocentricity of either a conscious or unconscious variety than is the personal- ity.\"' T h e p e r s on constructs a schema of identity, but this is still centered on the self i n a \"selfish\" manner because of th e c o n - tinuation of a t l e a s t s o m e e g o c entricity. Piaget's concept of personality now comes in to counter this egocentric selfishness in the sense of the person's character (see p. 27). Thus, personality is the capacity to submit oneself to some form of discipline. \"For ex- ample, a man is not said to h av e a st rong p ersonality when everything i s egotistically determined and h e r e m a in s i n c a pable of d ominating the self. He i s s ai d t o h a v e a strong personality when h e i n c a r n ates an ideal or defends a cause with all his activity and will.\" \"' Personality therefore implies \"a kind of d ecentering of the self,\"\" ' w h i c h s u b o r d i - nates the more egocentric tendencies to a dis- ciplined course of action. Pi aget does not believe that such value-directed behavioral patterns are \"input\" f ro m t h e e n v i r o n ment. T he person must construct his o r h e r o w n personality (character ). Consistent with what we have already said of the egocentricity of idealistic thought in adolescence, there is a paralleling sense of a f f e ctive egocentricity during this stage of life. Piaget believed that the adolescent: \".. . w a nts to surpass and as- tound them [his or her elders ] by transform- ing the world.

In the final analysis, Piaget puts his trust in reason to calm the t u r b ulent w a t ers of adolescence. \"In reality, the most profound tendency of all human activity is progression toward equilibrium. Reason, which expressed the highest form of equilibrium, reunites in- telligence and aRectivity.\" \"' This is precisely where we would expect him as an evolution- ary rationalist to place his trust.

There is a logical neces- sity over and above the biological necessity, which is why systems of mathematics have been worked out by d i R erent cultures and by diRerent people within the same culture w ith no d i r ect contact between them. T h e specifics of a logical system might even diRer f rom one point of view to th e n e xt, but t h e form all thought takes as regards conceptions of space, succession, order, and so on, will be common. It is as if each person relives the same process in each individual life (ontogeny recapitulating a phylogeny of logical develop- ment ) .\"' This does not mean that everyone makes it to the highest levels of abstract thought, of course. Some people do not construct things clearly; they make errors in judgment or fail t o progress beyond a certain level. T his i s what Piaget would call a fixation in develop- ment — a failure to evolve. He also oRers some interesting observations on the possibility of only li m i te d d e v elopment i n o p e r a t i o n al thinking, as follows: ... Th ere can be fixations at certain stages; there can be d'clays and accelerations. But I would even go f urther. Within t h e formal' operational level, it is entirely possible that some pe p/oe, for instance those in m a n ual professions, specialized laborers o f various sorts, may reach the formal operational level in the particular pro fessional domain, but not right across the board\".\" H ere again — since it is al w ays u p t o t h e person to construct what w il l e v e n t u ate in cognition — Piaget is making allowances for Commonalities and Variations in Development Piaget's contention is that all human beings pass through the stages of intellectual and aRective development we have just reviewed. They do so not because they have been pre- programmed by heredity but because there is a kind of logico-epistemological necessity for all human beings — given their natural en- dowment — to develop in this fashion, once interactions with reality are begun following birth. It is e a s y to c o n f u se t he b i o l o gical necessity of heredity with the logical necessity of higher and higher levels of thought.

Imitating o thers, we also learn how w e m i g h t d i ff e r from others and to this extent we know more about our selves. Affection plays an important role as well, because children are more likely to imitate liked than disliked people.\"' Piaget would suggest that s o-called ic lenti ication with a parent is tied closely to the accommo- dations based on affective schernata. We in- teriorize our parents' behavior and values be- cause we have emotional schemata to which w e assimilate their identities and t hen a c - c ommodate that w h ic h t h e y b e l i eve i n . \" ' Piaget has no series of personality theorotypes to which he alludes in his writings. What the particular self-identity an d p e r s o n ality-re- lated value system will be l ik e d epends en- tirely on the uniquely developing individual, the equilibrations achieved in the continuing c ircular reactions of a d j u s tment, an d t h e peculiar patterns accommodated through imi- tation. We would have also to take into con- sideration any fixations or partial fixations in development, as discussed in the previous sec- tion. It follows that the range of in d iv idual differences in Piagetian theory is great indeed. He, like the other theorists in the phenom- enological-existentialistic tradition, is l o a t he to categorize people. Individual-Differences Constructs Becoming a Person: Inter iority'ation via Imitation P iaget obviously leaves much room for t h e person as actor in constructing not only hi s or her self s chema bu t a l s o t h e a ff e c tive schema which, as a system of values, holds the more selfish side of behavior in check as the personality (character ). The specif ic con- tents of these schemata are naturally inRu- enced by the people with whom the child is reared and the society in which the rearing takes place. But it is up to the person to do the actual constructing of self and personality. It is true that people pattern themselves after others, interiorizing those aspects of another person's behavior which they imitate. Piaget defines imitation as the \"primacy of accom- m odation over assimilation.\" '\" O f c o u r s e , assimilation is always primary to accommoda- tion and imitation probably grows out of re- productive assimilations which have a begin- ning schema already patterned. As P i aget notes, \"The child imitates an aeroplane or a tower because he understands their signifi- cance, and he is only interested in them when they have some bearing on his own ac tivi- In time, however, as the child imitates more and more things, he or she finds the accommodation side of the circular reactions Language as a Means o f Personality Influence: Pros anci Cons P iaget has never been of th e o p i n ion t h a t language structures thought. Hi s studies of e gocentric language convinced h i m t h a t verbal usage is not patterned by the environ- m ent but is rather constructed from w i t h i n the child's internal mental activity. Sensori- motor constructions and action schemata are patterning behavior even before the child has a language to use. Thus, says Piaget, \" . . . prior to any language, more or less complex >> 184"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i nd s of Constructive Theories: J ean Piaget and George A. Kelly 7 0 5 systems of representation can be formed.\"'\" Once it is l earned, language can influence what we think, but it cannot be said to shape thought itself as the behaviorists would claim. In using language, the child's i m i t ative capacities are being extended, but the point of importance is that the child does actively make use of words as an instrumentality to gain a desired goal (teleonomic behavior ). Language is an accompaniment to action, be- ginning mainly in t h e f o r m o f o r d er s an d expressions of desire by the child. Once it is being used, the child is also able to recon- struct past actions in memory by verbalizing about them; this would be the beginnings of representation (imagination ).\"' In t i me, the word used to describe an action begins to f unction as a sign, so that r ather than j u st being a part of the action, it can evoke the a ction or bring it t o m i n d . T h e n an d o n l y then is the verbal scheme detached from the sensorimotor scheme and used in i m a g ina- tion as a memory. The child begins by grasp- i ng the teddy bear reflexively and, in t i m e after imitation-prompts from parents, learns to say \"teddy\" w h il e f o n d l ing th e b e l oved toy. The word would never be related to the toy if th e c h il d d i d n o t a l r e ady possess a sensorimotor scheme of the fluRy plaything. Later, each time the child plays with the toy, the word \"teddy\" will be part of the action, but also a verbal scheme will be under con- struction. Once it is constructed, the child will be able to ask for \"teddy\" and /or recall play- ing with the toy bear (representation ). Even after the c h il d h a s c o n structed a series of verbal schema (words tied to per- ceived objects, persons, and so on ), there is no assurance that by using them a genuine com- m unication is being attempted. During th e period of collective monologue, \"words have n o social function\" \"' a s th e c h il d i s p l a y - fully assimilating them to a ction schemata. Piaget would say that a true di a logue does not occur until the child responds to a state- m ent expressing a p r o position b y t a l k i n g about something that was in t ha t p r o p osi- tion.'\" If P aul oRers an opinion on why the swimming-pool water is so cold only to have Louis \"respond\" by laughing and saying that h e is going to throw hi s toy d uc k i n t o t h e water, a dialogue has not been joined. When it does emerge, it will be because both chil- dren make an eRort to cast their language in a mutually understandable way. Piaget sug- g ests that children probably learn th e i m - p ortance of this by first getting in an a r g u - ment over some point of m u t u a l i n t e rest.'\" For example, if Louis jumped into the water and claimed it was not cold, then in the quar- rel with Paul over this issue, a lot could be learned by both boys in how to communicate. As in the case of the development of will, so long as a statement goes unchallenged, the child simply says things to a ccompany the more important fact that he or she is a'oing things. Language thus evolves from a playful endeavor to the serious business of making our wants and opinions known. Once this bridge has been crossed, lan- guage becomes an important factor in social influence. The child can through representa- tion make a better estimate of what is taking place in life and can more clearly negotiate circumstances to his or her preference. With the acquisition of the skills of r e a ding, the maturing person will g r eatly extend repre- s entations, take o n v a r i o u s i n t e r e sts, a n d eventually construct those important schemata known as the self and the personality. Even though language plays such an i m p o r t a nt r ole in development, Piaget must b e c o n - sidered a critic of personologists who explain behavioral style in t e rms of e n v i r o n mental shaping through language acquisition. Lan- g uage does not shape the person; it i s t h e other way around. Indeed, Piaget has reserva-"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Part III 706 Ka n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook tions about those explanations of personality that rest upon social influence. only because they have been so structured by individuals. In this sense, \" . .. all the social sciences yield structuralist theories since, how- ever diRerent they may be, they are all con- cerned with social groups and subgroups, that is, with self-regulating transformational total- ities.\"\"' A s s o cial scientists, we study these stable structures called societies, structures that have evolved through construction in the same way that higher mental reasonings have evolved within the skulls of each of us. Just as we do not r e ify mi n d as e x i s ting i n d e - pendently from body, we do not reify society a s something existing i n d ependently f r o m t he individuals who gave it b i rt h an d n o w sustain its existence by mutual consent. Having now pu t t h e m a t te r o f s o ciety's o rigins straight, we can recognize that th e normative structures of th e h i s t o rical past serve a constraining influence on the present. Society is not transmitted from generation to generation internally, as is the case of instinc- tive behavior in lower animals. Only through the external pressure exercised by individuals upon each other can the weight of society be felt.\"' In this sense, society can be seen as \"a series (or rather many intersecting series ) of generations, each exercising pressure upon the one which follows it.. .. \" \" ' I f w e l ook at the history of societies, we find a gradual lessen- ing of this pressure brought to bear on one generation by an e a r l ier g e n eration. \"The more complex the society, the more autono- mous is the personality [of its members ] and the more important are the relations of co- operation between equal individuals.\" \"' In a complex society, it no longer becomes possible t o press just one point of v i e w i n a n a u - thoritarian, constraining sense. People must at this more advanced stage of societal evolu- tion cooperate and compromise in order to maintain the integrity of the culture. L ooked at from the point of v ie w o f t h e individual person evolving beyond the senso- rimotor influences of biological reflexes to a The Limitations o f Social Explanations In the final analysis, Piaget's message is that mind and those related factors entering into personality are created (constructed ) inde- pendently not only of language shapings but of any form of s o c ial or c u l t u ral i nfluence. There is a patterning of behavior constantly underway in d e velopment, but th e l o g i c al order of this pattern is not done in the en- vironment and then placed into the person. The person as an organically developing but also logically developing organism does the patterning, the constructing o f w h at he o r she will be like as a finished product in adult- hood. Society is not something apart and dif- ferent from the individuals who make it up. All members of society learn to be who they are in a similar fashion, and although there are interpersonal factors to consider in each individual's life, these factors do not explain how this learning is achieved.\"' Learning is rooted in human nature, in the biologically b ased sensorimotor actions on which m i n d is then constructed. Society is in t hi s sense closer to biology than to a s u p r aindividual force of a group mind or some such. Human- ity is the reflection of the single mind of any one human being. Piaget s views are nicely summarized in t he following:, \" 'Society' is neither a th i n g nor a cause, but a system of relationships, and it is for the psychologist to classify these re- lationships and analyse separately their re- spective eRects.\"'\" No w t h e se relationships are not simply there, in reality from the be- ginning of time.

For the individual, left to himself or herself, would remain uncon- sciously egocentric.\"' It is in the comparison of oneself to o t h ers — attempting to convey an idea through language or observing some disparity in b e havior between oneself and other people — that more and more awareness is generated. Also the resulting competitions when we compare ourselves to others stirs greater achievements as well as cooperative endeavors. All of th e p r oblems of i n t erper- s onal relations then enter t o g r e a tl y c o m - plicate the picture of what human nature is really like. Piaget's basic image of humanity stresses the biological beginnings and the in- dividuality of c o nstruction in g e n etic epis- temology. The child is parent to th e adult, and children develop from an organic reality which must not be forgotten in our zeal to explain behavioral patterns interpersonally. Implications for Abnormal when we have a lasting (learned ) pattern of behavior that fails to meet the person's needs, we have abnormality taking place. It is not \"natural\" for evolution t o d e v elop disequi Libria, of course. But s i n ce t he i n d i v i d u a l person is a factor in the construction of sche- mata and the operations of thought that em- ploy these conceptual frames, it is inevitable that serious problems will arise. We might now review some of the possible sources of difficulty. First of all, Piaget notes that the very in- adequacy of being a child among adults has within it the possible seeds of a serious prob- lem. Children are constantly surrounded by adults who not only know more than they do, b ut who ar e c a p able o f a n t i c i p ating t h e thoughts and desires of children. This leads to s ome children t h i n k in g t h a t a d u l t s (and later, other people in general ) can read their minds. This may even be the reason egocen- tric children do not make the effort to t alk c learly, convinced as they ar e t h a t a d u l t s know what they are thinking about anyhow. Piaget suggests that some of the delusional symptoms to be seen in adult psychotic dis- orders like schizophrenia may stem from this e arly experience.\"' T h i s m a y c o m e a b o u t e specially if the child i s r e ared i n a h o m e where control through constraint rather than through cooperation and mu t ual r e spect is practiced. Though children construct th eir own self-identities and the aRective schemata of personality, they are obviously inffuenced by the kinds of interpersonal relations (love, trust, and so on ) they encounter in t h e i r family setting. We have already noted in our d i scussion of development that it is essential for a child to acquire a realistic self-estimate. Children who grossly overrate or underrate themselves are doomed to maladjustments of one form or another. Piaget is fundamentally a reaList Behavior Though Piaget does not have a formal theory of illness or cure, there are many points in his writings at which we can see implications for these aspects of personality study. First of all, we must get a general definition of what abnormal behavior or maladjustment means to Piaget. Recall that Piaget defines learning as taking place when a durable equilibration is achieved via some behavioral action.\"' The person who has learned has constructed a behavioral pattern that lasts because it is suc- cessfully answering needs via the circular re- actions of assimilation and accommodation. On the other hand, Piaget notes that \". . . durable disequilibria constitute pathological organic or mental states.\" \"' In other words,"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Part III 708 Kan tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook in theoretical persuasion (see p. 14).

Probably we all have a certain degree of such denials of reality. We all live some- what in a dream world, assimilating to our self-images those things we find a d m i r able and repressing those things we dislike. But if this lack of realistic adaptation to the re- a lities facing us gets too extreme, we w i l l essentially construct our ow n p r o b l ems be- cause it will be us and not reality that is out of adjustment. Affective schemata. in par- ticular are likely to distort reality in this es- sentially unconscious fashion.\"' We must also recall that Piaget's recog- nition of fixation allows for abnormal thought patterns to develop, because if a child retains egocentricity and continues thinking about reality in syncretic and other prelogical ways, it would be increasingly likely that his or her social adjustment would suffer in maturation to adulthood.\"' M any of th e b i zarre behav- iors witnessed among psychotic individuals can be understood as being due to the con- fused perceptions and operations that result from Fixated, narrow, syncretic thought. The rigidity of paranoia, for example, suggests a lack of reversibility as noted in the intuition of semilogic of early childhood. It is not that the paranoid has regressed to early childhood, but merely that he or she has fixated at this level. Partial fixations can also be seen in restricted problems of narrowness of the sort that Jung called one-sidedness. To the extent that the schemata are narrow and t h ought lacks reversibility, the individual may be seen to compensate by p r essing schemata that really do not fit onto reality. When this hap- pens, Piaget tells us that \"assimilation is dis- t orted.\"\"' I t i s a c o m b i n a t ion o f al l t h e s e f actors — durable disequilibria, f e e l ings o f weakness, repression, and fi x a t ion — which provides the basis for explanations of abnormal behavior in Piagetian theory. In order to cure these difficulties, Piaget wo ul d d o u b t lessly p ut his trust in an h o n est facing-up to th e realities of life. The well-adjusted (adapted) person in Piagetian theory is self-accepting, willing to accommodate, and above all, realis- tic about life. George A. Kelly's Psychology of Personal Constructs We next move to a constructivism of another variety in th e p sychology of p e r sonal con- structs proposed by George A. Kelly. Though he shares certain phenomenological prece- dents with Piaget, as a psychotherapist inter- e sted in viewing the world from t h e (intro- spective ) point of view of hi s c l i ents, Kelly had a purely cognitive or conceptual interest in the constructive process. He did not have that biological or material form of construc- tion in his theory that we f o un d so central to Piaget s views. Ihograyhical Overview George A. Kelly was born in A.merica's heart- land, the flat, expansive state of K ansas on 28 April 1905. Kelly was an only child, and his mother doted on him.

He later attended high school in Wichita, Kansas, living away from home much of th e t im e after he w as thirteen years old. Kelly's parents were de- voutly religious in a f u n d a m entalist sense, a nd they were always working to h elp t h e needy in any possible way. His mother made pastoral calls on the sick, and his father was active in his faith, even when he was not lead- i ng a church congregation of his own. Th e family was hard-working and frowned on the less serious aspects of life l ik e d a n cing or c ard-playing. However, as th e o n l y c h i l d , Kelly was given much attention by his par- ents, and his school attendance away from the family home provided him with a broad- e ned outlook on l if e w h i c h h e m i g h t n o t otherwise have had.

Kelly was not certain what he wanted to do with his life at this point. He gineering and even worked in this new field for a brief time before he found his interests turning to education.\"' I n r a pi d succession, he worked at a labor college in Minneapolis, taught speech for the American Bankers As- sociation, and then conducted an Americani- zation class for future citizens. It was while he was teaching at a junior college in Shel- don, Iowa, during the w i n ter of 1 927 — 192S, that Kelly met Gladys Thompson, who later became his wife. Mrs. K e ll y w a s t eaching high school English, but both she and George coached dramatics in the same building. This work in theater was to prove extremely im- portant to Kelly's eventual theory of behavior. Kelly's professional development took a major turn in 1929 when he was awarded an exchange scholarship. He spent a year study- ing under Sir Godfrey Thotnson — an eminent statistician and educator — at the University of Edinburgh. Kelly earned a Bachelor's de- gree in education during this period, but in the process he developed an interest in psy- chology. He returned to th e U n i t e d S t ates from Scotland in 1930 to enter the State Uni- versity of Iowa as a graduate student in psy- chology. In 1931, working under Lee Travis, Kelly was awarded the Ph.D. based on a dis- s ertation dealing w it h c o m mo n f a c t ors i n speech and reading disabilities. He had, in the meantime, begun work in p h y siological psychology and developed a speculative theory aphasia.\"' The stock market collapse and subsequent d epression had settled on A m e r ica by t h i s time, and Kelly's career did not seem espe- cially promising as he took up a position with the Fort Hays Kansas State College. He had recently married. Times were difficult, and though Kelly's home life was a source of per- sonal happiness — he was to father a daughter and a son — he soon decided to \"pursue some- thing more humanitarian than physiological psychology.\" \"' Kelly threw himself into the development of psychological services for the state of Kansas. He was the major force in establishing a program of t r aveling psycho- logical clinics which not only served the entire state but permitted hi s students to o b t a in p ractical field experience.

In 1946 he moved into national prominence as professor and director of clinical psychology at Ohio State University. Carl Rogers had already left Ohio State for Chicago, and Kelly, along with his brilliant clinical colleague Julian B. Rotter, during the next twenty years built this pro- g ram in clinical psychology into one of t h e best in the world. Kelly completed his major theoretical work at Ohio State. His students helped to refine his thought, conducting supportive experi- ments; at the end of a decade of hard work, the Psychology o f Personal Constructs reached print (1955a R b). The only other volume of Kelly's work appeared posthumously under the editorship of a former student, Brendan Maher (1969). Kelly spent the last decade of his life applying his theories to various aspects of psychology. He held visiting professorships and lectured at various research congresses and institutions of learning all over the world. He acquired followers and admirers on both sides of the Iron Curtain.

It is not that w e make up the world to suit our fancy, for we do not live in a d r eam wo r ld. Events must be handled in such a way that our interpreta- tions fit what is actually present. The universe is real; it is happening all t h e time,' it is integral; and it i s o pen to pi ece meal interpretation. Di fjerent men construe it in different tvays. Since it otves no prior allegiance to any one man's construction sys- tem, it is altvays open to reconstruction. Some of the alternative ways o f construing are bet- ter adapted to man's purposes than are others. Thus, man comes to una'erstand his svorld through an in finite series o f successive ap proxsmati ons.' The distinction between mental and phys- ical events troubles theorists only because they think of the problem in t h ese terms at th e outset.

Kelly left open the question of whether it is possible to frame a single theory of real- ity — arguing that i f this were to take place it would happen at a very distant point in th e future.\"' Even so, Kelly, like Piaget (see p. 708), essentially accepted a realistic view of It made the best sense to Kelly to proceed for the foreseeable future with theories of an intermediate, even \"mi ni ature\" n a t ure, the- ories that did not profess to be capturing the single or ultimate nature of reality. He spoke of his psychology of personal constructs in these terms, expecting that it would one day give way to better formulations which might say more sweeping and lasting things about the reality of experience.\"' Ke lly asked his students to try his theory on for s ize to see how instructive it mi ght be, and he always added that if after ten years or so the theory was found to be unfruitful, he would toss it aside and try something else. Thus for Kelly, the issue of mind versus body is a pseudo- problem, one that disappears when we prop- erly understand the nature of theorizing in psychological science. the world. side of human nature per se.

Kelly stated flatly that \"all behavior can be c onstrued as anticipatory in nature.\" '\" B e - havior is the person's way of posing questions about life.'\" Hu man beings come at life with an active intellect, one that is not under con- trol by events but that puts events under con- trol by posing questions of experience and then seeking answers to them.'\" As people find these answers and pose new questions, they constantly change their out- looks.

Kelly insisted that a personality theory must account for al/ people — those under study and those who study and report on the findings of psychological science.

It b ears the meaning of an abstraction from events and also in- volves conceptualizing subsequent events ac- cording to this abstraction. These events or the facts of experience are real enough, but each person sees them from his or her own particular slant. Different people do not al- ways see the same meanings in the same fact pattern. Shirley pokes fun at Lori in an effort t o be friendly, but L o r i fi n d s t h i s h u m o r offensive. Not only has Shirley failed in her effort to be friendly, she has alienated Lori altogether. Neither young woman is at fault here. Shirley might indeed have intended to be hostile in making a joke about Lori s be- havior. In point of fact, she was not. But also in point of f act, L or i c o nstrued the joking behavior as intentionally hostile and this is what will require change if this interpersonal relationship is to improve. Kelly emphasized that the construing pro- c ess is temporal, so that \" t o c o n s t ru e i s t o hear the whisper of the recurrent themes in t he events that r e verberate around u s.\" \" ' This process is uniquely bi p o lar T h a .t i s , when a person affirms the commonality of e vents that recur over t i me, he o r sh e m u s t also negate some other aspect of that experi- ence. To say \"Redheads tend to be hotheads\" is also to say \"Nonredheads tend to be level- headed.\" Construing is ne v er a u n i d i m e n - sional process.\"' Indeed, said Kelly, thought is only possible because we humans can and must dichotomize experience into similarities and contrasts.'\" Me a n ing a l w a ys t a kes on this bipolar nature, for w he n w e s p eak of what something means, we are always refer- ring to a re lationship b etween what thi n g s seem /i (e and also different from L o r i u n - . doubtedly feels that Shirley's jokes are like those of another associate's, M argot — and everyone knows how hostile Margot is!

Kelly d ef in ed t h e co n s t r u ct a s is a way in which at least two elements are similar and contrast with a third. There must therefore be at least three elements in the con- text. There may, of course, be many more.\" \"\"' Constructs are like transparent patterns or templets which human beings create (con- strue ) in order to fit over the recurring reali- ties of life.\" T h e y b e gin in a b straction and generalization, but they are also imposed on subsequent events, so that in a s ense we all create our personal experiences at least as m uch as they create us.\"' L o r i ' s (mis) con- struction of Shirley's behavior might b ecome follows: \"In its minimum context a construct"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Part III 714 K a n t ian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook a self-fulfilling prophecy if she begins to re- spond in kind, and overt hostility does in fact emerge in the relations between these young women. Constructs are always the end prod- uct of that organismic process discussed in the previous section — a process we may now call construing. Kelly used several diferent terms and phrases to refer to c o nstructs over the years, including \" w o r k i n g h y p o t h eses,\" \"' \"interpretations,\" \"' \"predictions,\" \"' \"path- ways of movement,\" \"' an d e v e n \" a p p r ais- als.\" \"' Hi s p o int is that the construct is an i dentiFiable, patterned structure or st yle o f viewing life experience which we, as students of personality, can point to in others and in ourselves. It is not essential that a. construct be named.'\" K e ll y p r e sumed that children begin formulating constructs even before they can speak. Some of our constructs are so dif- f icult to put into words that we may find i t necessary to pantomime them. For example, poking a forefinger under a nose to slightly raise the head can signify \"being uppity\" or \"stuck-up.\" This is a construct, even though we might not add the symbol (word) uppity Of course, just saying \"uppity\" m akes it appear that we have named our construct in terms of a commonality of behavior — as seen in people with in flated self-conceptions, for example. This would not quite capture what Kelly meant by a c onstruct. To be spec iFic, we must name both ends of the construct di- mension in order to deFine it properly. Kelly once put it in t e rms similar to our example, to the visual act. thing li (e this, if ue w ere to express a true construct: \"Mary and A/ice are gentle; Jane is not.\" Or we m i gh t say, \"Jane is more at tractive than Mary or Alice Kelly referred to these two ends of the con- struct dimension as the poles of a construct. Each construct thus must h ave a si m i l a rity pole and a contrast pole.\"' A construct always says how two things are alike (similar ) and also diBerent (contrast ) from a th ird t h i n g . Kelly rejected the term co ncept because he felt that it merely considered the similarities among things, and he never wanted to over- look that saying what something is im p l i e s what itis not. When we come to name our constructs, we are free to choose the most secret, cryptic, and even vague designations we might spontane- ously arrive at. This is what Kelly meant by the personal construct, combining the mean- ing of private, unique, and even pecuti ar into' its designation. We never know what a per- son's language actually means until we have a fairly good u n derstanding of h i s o r h e r p ersonal constructs in l i gh t o f t h i s verbal usage.'\" This is not to say that we lack group constructs or common constructs which every- one grasps quite clearly (objectively ). But as a personality theorist, Kelly w a s t r y in g t o show how individuals arrive at their (subjec- tively ) unique interpretations of things. Con- structs are usually named on t h e b a si s of their similarity pole. Irr Kelly's example above, for instance, \"the construct of Ma r y li fte - A/ice unli (e Jane is likely t-o be s-ymbolized in the person's thinking simply as Ma ry o r Maryness.\" \"' Our construct of \"uppity\" sug- gests that we see people commonly ( similar- ity pole ) as having this characteristic but that there are others who are not se en this way. Of course, just what the contrast pole may be named is up to the individual who is doing the construing.

Figure 27 presents a schematization of two construing minds, A and B, ordering identical life events from different perspectives. Note that one templet or construct is stylized as a square (mind A) and the other as a triangle (mind B). This symbolizes the fact that the specific constructs may vary, yet th e events brought under consideration or framed by the constructs may be identical — which is essen- tially what occurred when Shirley viewed her jokes (life events ) one way (let us say, as mind A ) and Lori viewed them quite another way (mind B ). In most instances of the sort depicted in Figure 27, the tw o p eople con- cerned would find it difficult to communicate because they would literally be viewing the world from two different perspectives. On the other hand, other constructs can come into play to facilitate communication, or the con- structs presently employed can always be re- construed (changed ) in order to b r in g i n t o alignment their conflicting alternatives (cir- cles can become triangles or vice versa ). Kelly always stressed that the human being is not locked into a fi xe d c o n s t ruct system unless he or she believes that this is true. The square thinker can take on a triangular slant for variety or in a \"let's pretend\" sense. When this takes place, the kinds of meanings that will issue from the l i f e e v ents u n der co n- struction will have changed somewhat. The person will see things differently. A re c o n struction will h a ve t a ken p l a ce.

There are changes, but the consistencies are what count. Cultural stereo- types are negative examples of our tendency t o systematize our c o n s t ructs. W e d o n o t analyze those times when a black person is industrious, a Catholic is flexible, or a Jew is shy and suggestible. We allow our preju- diced (controlling ) views to f r eeze us into the stereotypes of lazy blacks, rigid Catholics, and aggressive Jews, despite the many con- tradictions we confront daily. Even such fixed constructs can help us an ticipate events, of course, as long as our predictions are not al- ways invalidated. If it is possible to see lazi- ness, rigidity, and aggressivity in any person — to some extent, at least — then finding these qualities in our ethnic prejudices should not be too difficult. Furthermore, how we behave in relation to b l a c ks, Catholics, and Jews could easily bring about the kind of behavior w e predicted from the outset. As w e h a v e n oted above, constructs can b e c om e s e lf - fulfilling prophecies. Constructs are not all framed (construed ) at the same level of abstraction, so that some of them have a broad reference in our lives, whereas others refer to very limited and spe- cific life events. Kelly referred to this higher- or lower-order ranking in abstractness as the ordinality of c o n structs.\"' A su p e r o r di'nate construct is said to su b s ume (include the meaning of ) a subordinate construct. The former is more abstract than the latter, and it thus can take the latter int o it s ra n ge o f convenience (its scope of referential rnean- i ng).'\" Fo r e x a m p le, a c o n s t ruct such a s \"loyalty\" may be superordinate to the less ab- stract concepts of \"working unselfishly\" and \"doing what's asked.\" The range of conven- ience a construct has also delimits the rele- vance its meaning has to the person. Going beyond the range of convenience means a construct is no longer relevant or applicable to life events. In Figure 27 the life events sub- Common Characteristics o f Constructs Since constructs are not only abstracted from but imposed upon life events — ordering them and determining the meanings of one's ex- perience — they can be called controls.\"' A construct can lock us into a fi xed course of action. Constructs are real, and they capture r eal events. Although the reality of a c o n - struct is not necessarily the reality of a factual element under construction, the person be- haves in terms of his or her controlling con- struct and not i n t e r m s o f t h e f a c t u al e l e - ments.'\" A divorce lawyer hearing a husband and wife recount the \"facts\" of their declining marital relationship soon realizes that people are not simply lying about what happened. With each hurt, a p r e d icted recurrence of the offending partner is put to test again and again, convincing the husband or wife of the other's loss of devotion. Neither seems to see that by not accepting the viewpoints of each other, they have effectively doomed their re- lationship. A reconstruction is required, but the time seems past when it might have been possible. Life would be an intolerable series of in- consistent events if the human being could not perceive regularities and thereby formu- late constructs. We also have the capacity to systematically order our constructs into what Kelly called construction systems.\"' W e d o this by overlooking inconsistencies in the use of our constructs, so that even if a construct d oes not fit e x actly i n e ac h r e c urring l i f e event, we keep its general order intact.

' \" Thus, a person may apply his or her loyalty construct only to the family sphere. Family members should be loyal to one another. Once it is outside of parental and sibling relations, the range of convenience for thi s construct ceases and we no longer need exhibit loyalty A construct can move up or down the or- dinal ladder of abstraction, subsuming other c ontexts of the c o nstruction system by e x - tending its range of convenience or by de- limiting a narrow range by constricting and specifying only a few life events to which it applies. For example, we can dilate our con- struct by b r o adening th e p e r ceptual fi el d within which we make it applicable (spread out along the life events of Figure 27 more and more ).'\" Th e l o y alty construct can be extended beyond the family setting. Some- times this extension of a construct's range of convenience is loose, so that the meaning is unclear because of its tentative fit to the range of life events being included.\"' If' we extend loyalty to people beyond the family, when do we stop> Can a boss be loyal to a w o r k er, particularly during times of economic reces- s ion when a cutback in th e w o r k f o r c e i s necessary> Is it possible to lay someone oR work and yet be loyal to that person> Such questions arise for all of u s a s w e a t t empt to make sense of our lives, and we all have these more or less loose constructions in our hierarchy of personal constructs. To loosen construct meanings is not always bad, since it leads to creative insights at times.'\" When we loosen, we apply a \"rubber-sheet templet\" to experience and thereby shift our frame of r eference.\"' The best way i n w h i c h t o d o this is consciously, dealing with a construct's meaning in an experimental fashion and look- ing for the new insights a changing meaning might provide us with. Once again, the con- struing process is one of raising and answer- ing questions about our life events. It is also possible to tighten constructs, to freeze them into rigid definitions. Tight con- structs lead to unvarying predictions, which can in turn have either a positive or a nega- tive impact on the fi t o f o u r c o n s t r uct sys- tem.'\" Assume that Vernon has a stereotype about redheaded people being hotheads. If he were now to tighten this construct when con- fronting a redheaded man, he would say to himself something like this: \"N ow , l et's see, if it's true that r e dheaded people are hot- headed, then this redheaded guy talking with me will lose his temper if I p r ess him on a point. Let's see if he does!\" Here is a clear-cut prediction in which the outcome will put the c onstruct system to test. Ha d V e r n o n p e r - sisted in using a loosened construction of his s tereotype, he would h a v e simply chatted along with the man and then later \"recalled\" certain things said as being hostile in tone. O r he might h ave gone t h r o ugh th e c o n - versation with the idea, \"I had better be care- ful in talking to this guy or he' ll fly oR the handle.\" In behaving like this, Vernon never puts his loose construction to risk. T i g hten- ing stabilizes constructs and facilitates their organization. Superordinate constructs are difficult to develop if t h e l o w e r - order con- structs they subsume continue to be v a gue and unstable (loose).'\" If every person is a scientist, then tightening is obviously an im- portant aspect of experimentation — making thinking clear, projecting a hy p o thesis that can be confirmed or denied, and so forth. Tightening also relates to the permeability of constructs. By this Kelly meant the rela- tive capacity for a construct to t ake on new even to our friends."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Part III 718 K a n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook elements.'\" A permeable construct is not nec- essarily loose. If a construct of \"loyalty\" could not be applied beyond the family context, it would be impermeable, b ut this would n o t necessarily mean it was loose. We could have a very tight conception of loyalty limited to the family context. A good example of a tight, im- permeable construct occurs when s omeone says, \"That is clearly a chair and all one can do is use it as a chair.\" A person like this would be unlikely to see the myriad possibilities of chair functions, such as ladders for reaching, props against doors, or barricades for chil- dren's games. The impermeable thinker rea- sons like this, rigidly asserting that \"You are either right or you are wrong, now which is it>\" In contrast to such impermeable con- structions, Kelly noted, \"A construct is perme- a ble if it i s o p e n t o t h e a d d i t io n o f n e w elements, or elements beyond t h ose up on w hich it has been explicitly formed.\" \"' T h e permeable construct admits situational diRer- ences. A ladder is not a chair, but given cer- t ain situations in w h i c h n o s t e p l a dder i s available, we can substitute a chair or even a table for a ladder.

On the other hand, a construct that permits its ele- ments to belong to other realms concurrently (at the same time ), even as it fixes definite qualities for present purposes, Kelly called a conrtellatory construct.'\" F o r e x a m p l e , a s - s ume that M a rt y i s c a l l e d Jewlike even though he is a Christian; the qualities of a Jewish stereotype would be immediately con- stellated to him: if Jewlike, then aggressive, pushy, materialistic, and so forth. The pre- emptive thinker would say, \"Only Jews are Jewlike,\" whereas the constellatory thinker c an generalize a construct or u s e i t i n a n analogical sense without diminishing its fun- damental meaning. A construct that leaves its e lements open to construction i n a l l o t h e r respects is termed a propositional construct.\"' The propositional thinker is likely to engage in conscious elaboration of a permeable con- struction system, for he or she would reason that \"it is conventional to view all Catholics as rigid and authoritarian, but l e t' s see if things can be this uniform and simple.\" The p ropositional thinker is t hu s o pe n t o new evidence, willing to take an altered view on an experimental basis, and to this extent, he or she represents an opposite end of the con- tinuum from p r e-emptive and constellatory thinkers.\"' There are other terms of descriptive im- portance used by Kelly. A co r n preh ense ve ' construct is one that subsumes a wide variety of events, whereas the in c idental c onstruct has a much narrower range of convenience.\"' Mildred reflects a comprehensive construct when she says, \"Life is mostly a m a t ter of good or bad luck,\" but her construct is more incidental when she says, \"Once in a great while I seem to let what other people say or don't say get to me.\" Constructs can be made m ore comprehensive through d i l a t i on , o f course, which broadens their range of con- venience.

Conscious, Unconscious, and the Sel f as a Core-Role Construct We have already noted that not all constructs are verbalized. Kelly accounted for the con- scious-versus-unconscious-mind conceptions of classical analytical theory in terms of this ca- pacity for people to formulate templets which are not put into words. So-called unconscious mental contents, as seen in d r e ams, repre- sented preverbal constructs which continue to exert an influence on experience.\"' Strictly speaking, Kelly did not want to use this dis- itis a mista (e to say they are unconscious or that he is unau are o f them. Every day he ex- periences them, o ften all too poignantly, ex- cept he cannot put his finger on them nor tell for sure uhether they are at the spot the therapist has probed for them.a\" Kelly was opposed to thinking of an entity called self or ego, but he did say that we all have some construction label in terms of sel f identity. \" . .. It is quite appropriate to refer to a given person's self-construct, or to a class of constructs which can be c a lled personal self-constructs.\" \"' Here again, we are likely to formulate our sel f construct -around what we see as a core of similarity about our be- havior transcending a series of life events.

It might surprise and even hurt us to discover that what w e consider nice behavior another person calls passivity, but that is how life goes.

Kelly called this tendency we have ship, and he was so taken by this conception that he even toyed with the idea of calling his approach to personality study \"role theory.\" Kelly's use of the term role should not be confused with the usage often employed by sociologists and social psychologists. A role in the latter sense refers to a series of behav- ioral prescriptions (how to behave ), laid down by the culture and then enacted by all those people who play the role of father, phy- s ician, mother, teacher, and so forth. K e l l y viewed the roLe as a pattern of behavior de- fined by the individual rather than as a cul- tural product. It is a process whereby we as i ndividuals construe the c o nstruction p r o - cesses of other people, and basing our actions on what we un i quely understand is taking place in relation to us with these other peo- p le, carry out an interpersonal activity.\"' I n a manner of speaking, we each write our own scenario for how our i n t erpersonal relations will be going with other people. We make an interpretation o f w h a t t h e y a r e t h i n k i n g about us, and then we frame a roLe construct based upon this assumption.\"' This role con- struct guides the role relationship we have with these other people. Clayton suspects that his teachers find him boring, and basing his actions upon this personal construct of boring- interesting, relates to his teachers in a certain way. Kelly emphasized that a role construct must be \"based upon one's interpretation of the thinking of the other people in relation to whom the role is enacted.\" '\" Now, the interesting thing about such role relations is that the other people with whom we relate do not necessarily have to be think- ing about us in the way that we assume they are! \"' Clayton's teachers are not necessarily f inding him b o r i ng, and e ven i f s o m e d o , they all do not. This teaches us that role con- structs may include gross distortions of the i nterpersonal truth.\"' T h e b e a u t i fu l y o u n g woman who finds one day that her pleasant- ries spoken to a rather innocuous young man down the block have led the latter to construe an intricate and involved love affair between t hem finds herself the victi m of t h e u n f o r - tunate lad's colorless and lonely life. Yet in- sofar as this fantasied love affair entered into the young man's behavior — eventuating in a highly embarrassing scene when he sees his \"girlfriend\" on the arm of a n o ther — we can speak of his delusional system as a kind of role relationship (predicated on erroneous role constructs ). In most cases, of course, the role relations of people are more realistic and interpersonally accurate than this. Most of us learn to read the in tentions of o t h ers mor e correctly. Now, when we speak of the seL f as a con- struct or a s e l f-construct (self-concept, and so on ), we actually refer to a special case of the role construct. Kelly noted that there are unique core role constru-cts which define our relationship to other people.'\" We behave in relation to these as if our very life depended on them — as in one sense, it does. The early C hristians, for example, who w ent t o t h e i r deaths rather than renounce their faith were behaving in t e rm s o f t h e i r c o r e - r ole con- structs, viewing their cobelievers as brothers and sisters in God. A more mundane example might be the case of Dennis, who thinks of himself as an individualist. This is his core self-image, and he invariably arrays people along this comprehensive and superordinate construct of individualism versus collectivism. If Dennis senses that others are in t h eir con- struction of him — putting him into a mold, he might react quite angrily and stubbornly to a ny suggestion that he co m pr o mise or a c - commodate his views to those of the group. to relate ourselves to others the role relation"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i n d s of C onstructive Theories: Jean Piaget and George A.

There is no frozen psychic structure to move. Hence, we need no mental energies to run the per- sonality system.\"' K e ll y specifically rejected such terminology, as well as the drive con- struct which has been used so widely by the learning theorists.\"' He was not sympathetic with the views of learning being advanced in the academic centers of his time, which he f elt saw the person as little more than th e tail end of an unplanned reinforcement his- tpzy 28 0 Rather than seeing people as behaving ac- cording to some hedonistic principle based on the satisfactions of energic expenditure or i nstinctual reinforcements, Kelly said t h a t people find their r ewards in th e s u ccessful anticipation (prediction ) of events.'\" I t i s not the reward but the solution that brings the person satisfactions.\"' There is nothing special about this sequence of \"construe in p rediction and solve.\" Al l b e h avior i s l i k e this. Motivation is not a special topic for the psychologist, who could as readily dismiss it from the professional vocabulary as retain it.\"' If w e l ook t o th e person as a problem solver engaged in an active process of con- struing events in order to predict and control them, then both learning and motivation fall i nto lin e w i t h o u t s p e c ia l t r e a t m ent.

When n e wl y f o r me d c o nstructs are inconsistent w it h o l d e r c o n s t r u cts, a change is called for.\"' Of course, we human beings do not always change. We d evelop habits, which Kelly defined as \"a convenient kind of stupidity which leaves a person free t o act i n t elligently elsewhere.\" \"' O r w e literally avoid changing because of the sec- ondary factors operating on us, such as the lack of understanding that change is possible or the threatening possibilities that changing our behavior implies.

Kelly was sensi- tive to the charge that his theory of freedom and determinism as a relationship between superordinate (controlling ) and subordinate (controlled ) constructs might be seen as an overly \"intellectual\" account of human behav- ior.\"' Hi s t y p i cal response to this criticism was that the person's construing of events is not limited to verbalized symbols. Further- more, conative (active doing ) as well as cog- nitive (passive knowing ) behaviors fall under the range of convenience of one's construct system. Behavioral conations like all overt actions are not s o m ething ot h er t h a n o u r cognitions. Intellectual explanations would seem to be limited to verbalized (symbolized in language ) and c o g n i t i v e explanations, which is clearly not the tactic selected by the psychology of personal constructs.\"' Actually, Kelly did not like to t h ink of hi s v iew as a cognitive one.\"' He did not believe the term signified anything worthwhile for the person- ality theorist. The C P CCycle ana-' t-he Creativity Cycle Two important concepts used by Kelly clarify how constructs and construction systems can change. The first is the C P CC y c le, w-h-ich involves a sequence of construction in which circumspection, pre emption, and control -fol- low in that order and lead to a choice which precipitates the person into a particular situa- tion.\"' By ci r c umspection, Kelly meant that the individual deals with th e i s sues facing him or her as regards some problem in a prop- ositional fashion. Recall that a. propositional 7 construct leaves its elements open to construc- t ion in all other respects. It is \" o pen to al - ternative hypotheses.\" Hence, at th e o u t set of the C-P-C Cycle, individuals mull over the various possibilities facing them and look at the problem from different slants, until they finally pre empt! -Pre-emption means that one and only one alternative is taken on as the definition of th e p r o blem u n de r c o nsidera- tion. And as the old saying \"A p r o blem de- fined is a problem half-solved\" suggests, once this pre-emption occurs, a course of action in the service of its resolution is undertaken. When Hamlet mulled over his life situa- tion, including his father's death, his mother' s behavior, his uncle's attitude, and so forth, he was dealing circumspectively with a gnawing issue. However, when he finally settled on the question \"To be, or not to be ~\" Kelly argued that Hamlet had pre-empted other possibili- ties, other middle grounds short of his mur- derous construction (kill versus don't kill ).\"' A definite control (determination ) was fixed to Hamlet's future behavior once he decided which of the p r e-emptive alternatives open to him he would follow. Kelly notes that the final C of the C-P-C Cycle could just as well be termed a choice as a control feature of the cycle.\"' Because of the dichotomous nature of thought, people are always free to choose in the direction of a construct pole that they believe will further their construction system as a whole — and the subsequent prediction of e vents this system makes possible.\"' O n c e the choice has been made, then the control settles in and an act o f b e h a v ior i s d e t e r mined.

Creative people, on the other hand, can allow their constructs to s tretch or bend. They can often play w i t h constructs or, as Kelly liked to phrase it, \"try them on for size.\" We do not always have to take ourselves seriously or believe everything we think or say. It is this \"what-if >\" or \"let' s- a ssume-this-for-the-heck-of-it\" at t i t u d e that d iRerentiates the Creativity Cycle from t h e C-P-C Cycle. In the latter case, we are always engaged in a process that will bring us to an action of some personally construed variety.\"' We are not fooling around but are engaged in a search that will be a mere preliminary to some action. We are committed to act, even though the specific directions of this action a re not worked out yet at the outset of t h e C-P-C Cycle. In the Creativity Cycle, there may be no appreciable personal commitment to an eventual action, although it is true that when something new is construed, an action does often follow. h ave clarified what i s t a k in g p l ac e i n t h e construction system. K elly had m an y c r e ative t h i ng s t o s a y about those aspects of behavior that are typi- c ally associated with t h e e m o t i o ns. T a k e humor, for example. follies were interpreted by Kelly as neat reconstructions of ongoing experience associated with quick movements a nd unexpected outcomes because of a r e - versal in our constructive expectations (pre- dictions ).\"' The arrogant and p ompous gen- eral stumbles on his way to the rostrum and in his subsequent blushing and stammering proves to his snickering troops that he is a h uman being after all. I f w e a n a l y z e o u r favorite jokes, we are struck by the fact that, as Kelly said, their punch lines invariably rest upon a twist (reconstruction ) which rapidly rearranges our expectations of what is taking place. Kelly defined threat as awareness of an irn- minent comprehensive change in one's core- r ole constructs.'\" W e a r e t h r e a t ened to t h e extent that what we feared might take place looks as though it i s r e a lly c o m in g a b out. Threats are unhappy predictions we make. We do not w ant t h ese predictions to come true, but we expect them to anyhow. We are fearful that we have some terrible disease, so we arrange to see our physician. With each solemn look on the physician's face, we grow increasingly apprehensive, for we continually predict that she is finding what we are fear- ing she will i n d eed find — usually quite in error, of course St ress .is a mo re r e m o ve d psychological state, a kind of awareness of po- t ential threat.'\" S t r e s s m o ve s i n t o t h r e a t when the person becomes convinced that something is about to happen which will up- s et the ongoing construction system.\"' A s this begins to happen, as the constructs begin to lose their grip on our personal reality, we Emotive Terms ancl the Psychology of PersonaL Constructs Kelly thought of em o tion as behavior that w as either loosely defined\"' o r w a s n o t a word-bound but a preverbal or nonverbal con- s truction.\"' A p e r s o n ' s feelings are inner events needing construing (for example, \" What's happening to me> Why do I h a v e this mood>\" ) .'\" Sometimes what the i n d i - vidual calls an emotion is the other side of some consciously known and expressed con- struct.

At times like these, we witness signs o f emotion. The person may tense up, perspire, act erratically, and possibly in time, actually ffee from the threatening situation in a head- long panic. Flights i nt o s t ates of a m n esia which leave the person completely unable to recall anything about his or her past life are also possible. In fact, a spotty memory is char- acteristic of the threatened state. Because it is difficult to hold in memory that which is un- structured (poorly, loosely construed ), people have a hard time remembering what is hap- pening to them when under various levels of t hreat.'\" H e r e i s w h e r e a b n o r ma l s t a t es termed unconscious behavior are likely to be seen. One of the main reasons we fail to con- strue properly under states of threat is because we have the feeling that our ready-made con- structs cannot help us. W e a r e e s sentially w aiting to see what will happen in our l i f e, thereby forgoing the important role we must p ersonally play i n s tructuring th e f u t u r e course of that life. K elly considered the r e sultant \" l oss o f structure\" to be anxiety.'\" He u s ed to r e fe r jokingly to this psychological state as being caught with ou r c o n structs down.'\" W h e n we are anxious, we cannot predict; hence, it is impossible for us to solve our p r o blems. The emotional state of fear is at least a more focused experience. Fear occurs when some imminent incidental construct has loomed up i n one's path t o s u g g est t ha t i m p e n d i n g change is likely to take place.\"' In our earlier example, we suffered anxiety as we watched our physician, knowing not what she might find but predicting that whatever it was, it w ould be terrible. W hen sh e no w fi x e s a specific diagnosis (incidental construct ) which is serious and demands immediate treatment, we begin to suffer fear The advantage of f.ear is that with the stipulation of a given illness we have already begun a process of recon- struction. We can now set about f o l l owing our physician's directions for cure, read up on our disorder, lay new plans for health care, a nd so on. Of c o u rse, if ou r i l l n e ss is i n - c urable, our anxiety will n ever t ur n t o f e a r . Here is something — death — so incomprehen- sible that nothing w i t hi n ou r p r e s ent con- struction system subsumes it properly. At this point, what problem solution we arrive at depends on many factors, including our views on the meaning of existence and afterlife. Another aspect of emotional l if e h a ving great relevance to personality is what might be termed aggression or hostility. Al t h o ugh these terms are often used interchangeably by psychologists today, Kelly had a unique way of viewing what he took to be tw o d i s t inc- tive emotional states. For him, aggression was tantamount to an active elaboration of a per- ceptual field.\"' N ate is an aggressive person. He is constantly trying to broaden his hori- zons, to extend the scope of his construction system. We see him relying on the Creativity Cycle a lot as he plays with new ideas, reads new books, and looks for alternative courses of action. He is also a bi t s t u b b orn, reffect- ing the end state of the C-P-C Cycle, at which point he has put down a plan of action and is now committed to put his ideas into prac- tice. Nate is always willing to pu t hi s i d eas on the line, devising experiments which put his thinking to risk. Larry, on the other hand, is a passive individual. Larry dislikes having to put his ideas on the line. He tends to put this oR, or he expects conditions to be perfect before he is willing to tr y an yt h ing out. Of course, we are all a little like N at e in some areas of life and a little like Larry in others. But the point is: for Kelly, aggressive-passive as a construct describing behavior r elated to how actively we e l aborate our c o nstruc- tion system from day to day.

Kelly 7 2 5 know and to do things actively, he or she is likely to upset the gentle routine and con- struction systems of other people, who then misconstrue this aggressivity and consider it hostility! We are only hosti/e in Kelly's terms when we insist upon finding t rue the pr edictions we have made in the face of contradictory evidence.'\" As Kelly observed: \"The trouble with hostility is t ha t i t a l w a y s a t tempts to m ake the original investment pay oR. It i s unrealistic.\" \"' The hostile individual freezes his or her c o n structs into i m p e rmeability. Garret \"knows\" what is taking place in hi s job situation, where he has been having a lot of trouble with his coworkers. He \"k n ows\" what others are thinking, and why they are giving him all the trouble he is experiencing. No amount of explanation or alternative rec- ommendations by his coworkers will change his mind. It is the same thing at home with his children, where Garret never spares the rod. His children had better do what is ex- pected of them, and h e a l l ow s n o e x c u se making. There is no eRort on his part to un- when things go counter to what Garret de- mands. As is true of all hostile people, Garret really does not care what other people think. If he were simply an aggressive person, Gar- ret would take an i n terest in other people' s viewpoints, even though he m i gh t d i s p ute them. But Garret always punishes, frustrates, or somehow injures others when they fail to behave in the way hi s c onstruction system predicts they ought to be behaving. He can even do this injury in a passive way, by not hearing what others say to him, by forgetting an appointment or a birth date, or by over- looking the positive aspects of life in prefer- ence for the negative in all things. Another emotional tone often emphasized in personality theories is gui/t. Kelly defined this as perception of apparent dislodgment from one's role structure.\"' The guilty person d erstand a c h i l d ' s c o n struction o f e v e n t s is thus one who has done something which either is or seems to be in direct contradiction with his or her self-image around which the core-role constructs order themselves. Here is where the psychology of personal constructs would place conscience or su perego. Note that this dislodgment of guilt still represents t hreat. We are threatened by g u il t j u s t a s readily as we are by anxiety — and indeed it is sometimes difficult to separate anxiety from guilt. In general, however, a gu i lty p erson can identify the specific source of the emo- tional upset. The guilty individual feels that he or she has transgressed a core-value sys- tem, which, if religious in nature, represents structs, we often feel alienated from ot hers, because it is here that our interpersonal rela- tions take root. The o n ce-faithful hu sband who \"slips\" from his role and has an aRair with another woman while on a business trip f inds himself unable to r e l ate t o h i s w i f e upon his return home. By dislodging his self- construct, this man both feels guilt and finds that he can no longer relate to his wife on the same grounds as before. What to do> If confession is eventually made of the iiifidelity, it is because the husband wants to reconstrue his self-image (as no longer perfectly faithful but a repentant \"sinner\" ) and regain a sense of relatedness with his wife. Of c o u rse, the marital bond itself might be reconstrued by the wife, resulting in divorce or a much less affectionate relationship, and so forth. a sin.'\" Wh e n we v i o l a te our c ore-role con- The Defense Mechanisms Kelly did not favor a defense-mechanism ap- proach to the description of behavior, though he did comment on some of these Freudian conceptions.

Note th e i m - p licit tie here between hostility and pr o Iec- tion! Reaction formation is a-n attempt to put the \"opposite\" construct pole in effect when it is the other pole that bears the significance f' or a person. at this stage of life, by which Kelly meant a p reverbal figure c o n struct s i g n i f y in g t h a t some one person (mother ) is essential to per- s onal survival.\"' B y figure we mean th e image (mental picture ) of a mother or sur- rogate (stand-in ) mothering-one. Kelly noted, \"When the child uses a figure in t hi s m an- ner he actually develops two levels of mean- ing for Mo t h e r: t h e o n e r e f e r r i ng t o t h e actual behaviors of his mother, the other re- ferring to mo t h e rliness.\" \"' Su ch p r e v erbal constructs relying on images tend to be im- permeable and are what we usually find pop- ping up in dreams and other so-called uncon- scious behaviors. They are not very effective in determining interpersonal relations because they fail to consider the other person to be a construing organism. In other words, they are not role constructs. The task of maturing now becomes one of making such b a sic d ependency constructs m ore permeable, extending th e c h i l d' s r e - liance for existence to others besides mother.

Some people are very social in t h ei r r e c r eations, w hereas others prefer solitary pursuits.'\" T o understand the person, we would do well to observe his or her free-time activities. I f the child matures properly, we will i n time begin seeing a development away from the rigidly simplistic construction system to- ward greater use of propositional constructs and more permeable dependency constructs. The range of dependency expands as the per- son comes to understand life in a more com- plex fashion. Children m ove from w h o l e- figure constructs — in which the mother image is rigidly framed as only such-and-such a per- s on — to more flexible trait a t t r i b u t i ons t h a t recognize alternatives in the behavior of a single person.

Farmers have one view of what is right or wrong about their society and truck drivers have another. Communistic theories have made it appear that it is a cul- ture's means of production that determines the person's construction system, because of this tendency for people to see things by way of their occupational validations. Kelly found the communistic a nalysis wanting, and h e was also critical of th e t e n dency to b r e ak society down into upper-, middle-, and lower- class levels.\"' Though such breakdowns do tell us what advantages large groups of peo- ple enjoy, they sidestep the fundamental issue of how the in d i vi dual person can come to view the world independently of his or her c lass norm.

He developed a means (Rep Test ) for identifying the un i que constructions people m ake for t h emselves, recorded from t h e i r own unique slant. Kelly could see little profit in pigeonholing other people. What the psy- chology of personal constructs aims for is to grasp the unique slant of each individual hu- man being. This m eans that b y d e fi n i t i on advocates of this approach have entered into a role relationship with these individuals and thus can carry out the purposes for which the theory has been laid down.

Amy is convinced that her problems in lif e are due to the fact that everyone in her home town has been jealous of her family name. Her forebears were always leading citizens of the community, and ever since her youth, Amy has found people blocking out of pure jealousy her attempts to t ak e a l e a dership role. Amy never examines the evidence that her leadership efforts have been of low qual- i ty, or that when others have tried to w o r k o ut differences with h er , sh e h a s b l u n t l y turned them aside as covering up their jeal- ousy of her family background. In f a ct, so intricate have Amy's rationalizations become that when she first entered into psychother- apy at the age of forty her therapist had diffi- culty understanding her behavior. This is one of the signs we have of a serious abnormality in a personality — when we as therapists can- not predict our client's behavior.\"' Of course, therapists have a p r o f essional construction system which should always permit predic- tion of client behavior to some extent.\"' Bu t Amy is skirting the f r i n ges of a d elusional system at this point and there is much that is unpredictable in her behavior as she departs more and more from common sense in order to maintain her inadequate construction sys- Amy .'eflects the basic attitude of all ab- n ormal i d i v i d u als, in t h a t t h e y f eel t h e i r t roubles stem from t h e facts o f their l i f e events rather than from t h eir in t e r p retation (construction ) o f t h e s e f a c t ua l e v e n ts.'\" O ften, the abnormal person will b e gin r e - treating to earlier constructions of life, result- ing in so-called regression taking p la ce.'\" Abnormals turn to their parents, marital part- ners, or physicians for support and assistance in the validation of their distorting constructs.

Were we to know more about Amy's jealousy con- struct, we would learn that early in l if e she properly understood that other children were not accepting her because of certain selfish mannerisms in her behavior. Rather than re- construe her self-construct at this point and behave less selfishly, she fixed the imperme- able and unrealistic construct of jealousy on others. Henceforth she could dismiss all self- examination when others rejected her by say- ing, \"They are just j e alous of my family name.\" Her family name provided her with a — highly distorted — sense of respect and hence she could continue on as she did for years in a vulnerable psychological state, using a brittle construction system which was to put her on the brink of paranoia. Amy will be helped in her therapy, for she has not allowed her mental organization to deteriorate completely before seeking help. In cases of severe deterioration, the person has often loosened rather than tightened the con- struction system, dilating his or her constructs to some bizarre extreme of plausibility. As this occurs, it becomes obvious that the per- son has a loss of structure known popularly as loss of a grip on reality. Kelly held th at no one loses the patterning structure of his or her construction system entirely.'\" Ev en the most regressed psychotic has some remnant of c onstruction in o p eration. In f a ct , w e c a n view the symptom of a disorder as one form of this remaining structure. Kelly defined the symptom as \"the rationale by w h ic h o ne' s chaotic experiences are given a measure of structure and meaning.\" '\" Symptoms are, t h e refore, i n a ppropriate ways of adapting to problems.'\" Rather than meet a life challenge, an individual gets sick or gets drunk feeling that his or her inability to meet challenges is somehow now more ac- ceptable. The illness developed need not be free of an organic involvement, for just as an element of a construct is used as a referent for that construct in symbolic form (the \"name\" of a construct ), so too can a bodily organ be- come the symbol of a construct. \"When the client talks about the pain in his chest he may be expressing in his own language a far more comprehensive construct than the psycholo- gist at first suspects.\" \"' Preverbal constructs are based on the raw e xperience of bodily sensation without labels, and so-called psycho- physiological disturbances are likely to be ex- pressions of such beginning attempts to con- strue experience. In addition to providing a rationale (rea- son, excuse ) for present behavior, a symptom is also the way a client asks questions about t he future.'\" T h e p e r son i s o f t e n a s k i n g , \"Must I go on in t h i s w r etched state, being hounded and manipulated by people who do not understand what a good person I really am>\" From an external reference, this might be viewed as a delusional thought pattern. But from the client's viewpoint, it is an ad- mission that he or she is unable to enter into satisfying role relationships and to have a free interpersonal contact with the g i v e-and-take all of us hope to experience with others.

Most important of all, the professional- c onstruct system of t h e c l i n i c ia n m u s t b e capable of subsuming the personal-construct system of the client. In order to facilitate this process of coming to know how the client is viewing his or h e r w o r l d , K e l l y d e s igned what he called the Role Construct Repertory Test, or simply the Rep Test.'\" Let us assume that we have a client named Marco who has come to us with complaints of losing confidence in meeting challenges, and we want to i n crease our understanding of his construction system by administering a Rep Test to h im . T h e l o gi c o f t h i s t e st involves getting Marco to use and then name h is personal-role constructs by having h i m compare and contrast several people wit h whom he has had to deal in his life to date.'\" Various figures can be drawn from life, as for example: \"a teacher you liked,\" \"the most successful person whom you k no w p e r son- ally,\" \"the most threatening person wh om you know personally,\" or \" the most ethical person you know personally.\" In addition, the test taker's parents and siblings are used, and there is usually a self figure as well. Through the use of individual cards for each test figure or a specially prepared test form combining all figures on one page, Marco is then taken through a number of sorts in which he states how person X and person Y are alike and yet diferent from p e r son Z. Fo r e x a m ple, he might be asked, \"Compare your mother and your favorite teacher, and tell me (or record in writing ) how they are alike and yet di f ferent from your best friend.\" The characterization that emerges here- l et us say it i s \"competent\" — is considered only one pole of th e c onstruct actually in- volved. After a series of other comparisons and contrasts of this type, Marco will be taken b ack through his l ist o f d e s criptive wor d s (competent, snealty, moral, threatening, and so on ) and asked to name the other pole of the underlying constructs. Assume that Marco would write down \"questioning\" as the op- posite pole for \"competent.\" Kelly would say that one of the basic dimensions along which Marco relates to other people is in terms of this construct of \"competent versus question- ing.\" Whereas Marco's therapist might have assumed that the opposite of competence was incompetence, Marco has now revealed that he believes that competent people are likely to be a little close-minded and unquestioning in their approach to life. An open, question- ing attitude may not suggest competence to Marco, and as therapy proceeded, this interest- ing usage might become a central point of consideration as his feelings of lowered con- fidence came into the discussion. Maybe be- cause he does tend to question things and is open to other people's viewpoints, he assumes that he is not a competent person! There are many such hypotheses to be gleaned from a study of the client's construction system, and the point of the Rep Test is to br ing thera- pists into the world of th e c l i ent's personal construction system. K elly also devised a method f o r factor analyzing t he construct matrix of t h e R e p Test.'\" In the test form, for example, Marco w ould have provided us w i t h t w e n t y - t w o constructs, having sorted some nineteen dif- ferent persons (test figures ) as outlined above (that is, how are X and Y alike and diRerent"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Part III 732 Ka n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook from Z ). Through the (nonparametric ) fac- tor analysis of these sorts, a th erapist can arrive at a much shortened list of basic con- s tructs presumably used by M a r c o i n h i s actual construct system, but which he essen- tially renames several times in going through the Rep Test. Rather than his having twenty- two constructs, we learn that Marco has only f our or fiv e c o n struct d i m ensions that h e actually uses in coming at life. This core of meaningful conceptions is what we must get at if we are really to understand Marco and h elp him to change by reconstruing at thi s Constructs are not always stated in single words. Test subjects often describe their role constructs in brief phrases like \"I feel good with them\" or \"I d o n't l ike being with her.\" Prepared with such a list of c onstructs, the therapist can now (1) appreciate the client's slant on life; (2) adapt the language used in therapy to that. of the client's level of under- standing; and (3) begin framing hypotheses about which way the client's construction sys- tem will take him or her, given the changing events that arise over the course of therapy. This is the proper scientific attitude, the one Kelly wanted all advocates of personal-con- struct theory to follow. most basic of all levels. tered on the level of anxiety and the kind of solution made to the problems in living. The neurotic is likely to m a n i f e st anxiety more consistently and to show greater variation in pattern because of the fact that he or she is constantly trying to f r am e a ne w c o n struc- tion of events.'\" T h e ps y c hotic has passed through this fumbling phase and, after pos- sibly going to the heights of anxiety, has now settled on some delusional or h a l l ucinatory solution to the problems of living.'\" The neuroses are variations on this idea of trying to frame new constructions to justify the growing m a l adjustment. The hy s t erias are typified by converting problems from one area (psychological ) into another (bodily).'\" Hysterical and other psychosomatic patients are often people who have construed their worlds dualistically and pre-emptively — that i s, in terms of e i t he r a b o d y o r a m i n d sphere.'\" Having accepted this predicate as- sumption, they can e asily sym bolize t h eir mental problems in terms of a chest pain or an immobile hand. Obsessive compulsive -cli- ents use tightening as a defense against the failure in prediction they are beginning t o s ense in their construction systems.'\" W h e n their compulsions begin to trip them up, lock- ing them into some ritualistic performance, we witness the end stage of a tightly drawn, impermeable construct. Anxiety neuroses or panic states come about when a sudden com- prehensive construction is suggested with no escape in sight.'\" Th e p e rson i n a s t ate of panic is probably as low in predictive power as the human ever gets, and w e o f te n see these states popping up just before a psychotic solution is arrived at. Kelly saw the psycho- path as a person whose style of construction is not truly of a r o l e-relationship variety.'\" That is, a psychopath is interested in manip- ulating others rather than relating with them in a spontaneous fashion. Psychopaths are v ery selfish individuals, th i n k in g o n l y o f themselves in any i n t e rpersonal encounter. Clinical Syndromes and the Psychology of Personal Constructs Although Kelly did not f eel we need to re- tain the classical syndrornes of personal malad justment, he did make some effort to subsume these well-known K r aepelinian distinctions.

Delusions of g r a n deur ( \"I am t h e m o s t powerful person on earth\" ) or persecution (\" Everyone is out to do me harm\" ) are forms o f construct dilation.'\" D e l u sions of w o r l d destruction would suggest imminent collapse of the construct system (\"My world is falling apart\" ), and a constricted solution might well lead to delusions of s e lf-worthlessness (\"I can't find a way out of my problems because I'm useless\" ). The depression psychotic often takes the latter solution to his or her p r ob- lems.'\" We all construct our fields of action when under pressure to solve some life prob- lem. Depressed cases simply take this tactic to its extreme, severely limiting their alterna- tives to act. Suicide is always a danger here, but sometimes the depressed person swings to the opposite tactic and dilates his or her con- struction system into what is then termed a manic phase of the same disorder. Delusions of grandeur are then likely to appear, and the person's loosening of th e c o n struct system can also be seen in the phenomenon known as f reight of ideas.

One of the First types of movement to be seen in a therapy series is slot movement.\"' T h i s involves simply moving over to the contrast end of one's constructs, as when the woman who sees her neighbors all as kindly begins to think of them as mean. Kelly considered this a superficial change but a p r o c ess of movement worthy of note. We can as thera- pists build on t h i s c h a n g e, extending the comprehensive level. Whether neighbors are kindly or mean can then be tested in a series of experiments — such as asking the client to predict what will happen at the next church social or block party. themselves as frozen into a situation which Following a statement of the opening com- plaint by the client, the therapist usually asks for more information on th e c i r c u m stances surrounding such difFiculties. Kelly vi ewed this preliminary as a fundamental task of the therapist, one he called elaboration.\"' T h e point is: in e l aborating the co m plaint, the therapist encourages the client to extend the range of convenience of. his or her constructs and usually to b r in g o t he r c o n structs into play as well. Reconstruction often begins in the loosening that such elaboration encour- ages. That is, as clients date the onset of their problems and move backward or forward in t heir recollections, they naturally begin t o loosen their terms.\"' The therapist assists in this loosening process, encouraging a tight- ening at the proper moment so that, in eRect, the Creativity Cycle or the C-P-C Cycle may o perate. The therapist's goal is to h elp t h e client develop a set of constructs which are p ermeable and comprehensive.'\" A s t h e s e are psychological activities, Kelly can sum up his deFinition of the t h erapeutic contact as follows: \"Psychotherapy is the intelligent m anipulation and o r g a nization o f v a r i o u s psychological processes.\" \"' 1nterpretatt'on, 1nsight, and the Client's Vietvpoint The most vital point of K e l l y ian t h erapy is that in the final an alysis, the client always c ures himself or h e rself.

Clients always provide the f o cus of therapy because of personal constructions they introduce, and whatever change takes place is s imilarly going to t ak e p l ace only o n t h e basis of their personal efforts to r econstrue t heir lives. K e ll y w o u l d t a k e h i s c l i e n t s through a review of their past lives, but not be- cause this was required by his theory of per- sonality or therapy cure. Indeed, the past is only relevant because it can shed light on the pres- ent and the future life into which the client is moving.\"' T h erapy serves a primarily antic- ipatory function. Kelly liked to think of th e th erapist as a s ource of validation for the client.\"' I n r e - construing their experience, clients must nec- e ssarily begin with t h ei r p e rception of t h e t herapist. They try ou t t h ei r ol d a n d n e w c onstructs on th e t h e r apist at on e t i m e o r another — framing the relationship in light of their changing perspectives and looking in turn for some kind of reaction in the thera- pist's behavior. Kelly liked to use these client experiments as the focal point for in sightful c omments, or as he preferred to think of i t , as organized i nstruction.\"' B y e i t h e r v a l i - dating or not validating the client's construc- tions, the therapist — through his or her per- s onal reactions — is eRectively teaching t h e client which constructs fit and which do not. This process of adjusting constructs to experi- ential reality is t hen extended beyond th e therapy room to the client's real world. Ther- apy proceeds, like any other scientific venture, t hrough successive approximations.\"' T h e client does not need one i nsight but a h o s t of increasingly predictive insights to formu- late and reformulate the construction system. Some of these insightful experiences with the therapist will be unique, whereas others may fall under the constructs of the better known personality theories like the Freudian or Ad- By saying that insight is not always neces- sary, Kelly meant that the individual does not have to learn any doctrinaire theoretical ex- planations of behavior.

For example, if the psychologist feels it is desirable for a client to name — that is, assign a symbol to — some new c onstruct which is emerging in h i s o r h e r r epertoire of constructs, then K e ll y w o u l d c onsider this action a form of insight.\"' T o o many therapists seem to want this more for their own needs — as proof of their eRective- ness rather than as a necessary aspect of cure — but Kelly was willing to accept the neces- sity on occasion. If a highly rigid, religiously devout man who has become more proposi- tional and permeable in his thought is made aware that his thinking has loosened up, he might be spared some later threat when this more liberal outlook now appears in conflict with his religious convictions. This is surely a kind of insight. ReLationship Factors: Acceptance, Trans ference, and Resistance When we take up relationship factors in the theory of personal constructs, we begin deal- ing specifically with ro l e c o n s tructs. Since therapists are major validators of client con- structs, they begin to take on g r eat i m p or- tance as therapy progresses. This is why thera- pists, working t h r o ugh t h e i r p r o f e ssional c onstructs, must have g r e ater sensitivity t o and knowledge of relationship factors than c lients. As Kelly pu t i t , \"A therapist-client relationship is one which exemplifies greater understanding on the p art o f o n e m e m b er t han on the part of th e other.\" '\" T h u s , t o be eRective as a therapist, one must under- stand and utilize the constructs of clients- see with their eyes and talk their language. This is what K e lly m eant by ac ceptance.\"' By accepting the client's construction system in this way, the therapist conveys a sense of support to the client. \" T h i s d o es not mean the therapist approves of the c l i ent's value system, nor does it commit th e t h e r apist to going along with everything the client does. Acceptance merely signifies to the client that t he therapist truly un derstands why t h i n g s are taking place — right or wrong, good or bad things — from the client's perspective on life. This understanding reassures the client and makes it more likely that he or she will undertake the experiments therapy will call This brings us to the factor of rapport or relationship in t h e r a py. K e l l y i n t e r p r eted rapport in terms of his role theory. \" Rapport is established when the therapist subsurnes a part of the client's construction system and thereby enters into a role relationship with him or her. It is not unusual for the client to e stablish a c o m p arable r apport w i t h t h e therapist sometime later in the consulting ses- s ions. Signs of r a p p ort i n c l i e n t s i n c l u d e increased relaxation, greater spontaneity, flexi- bility, and the wi l l i n gness to loosen a con- struction.\"' Kelly believed that therapists can help promote client rapport by t a k ing on a credulous attitua'e r egarding what is b e i n g c ommunicated in t h e t h e r ap y h o u r . \" A credulous person is ready to believe whatever is told him or her. Kelly was not suggesting that effective therapists have to be gullible. What he meant by the credulous attitude is that we must take i n e v erything th e c l i e nt says, understand it correctly from his or her personal slant, and above all, never discard in- formation because it fails to fit with our own conceptualization of the case history. Credul- ity in this sense is openness. When clients perceive us as open to their c o m plete con- struction of events, we establish in them the proper expectancy for communication.\"' We c annot begin to co m m u nicate un ti l w e b e - l ieve that the person to who m w e send in - formation is actually open to it. The eRective fol'."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"T heories: Jean Piaget and George A. Kelly 7 3 7 Chapter 11 Two K i n d s of C onstructive therapist is always open to such information. S ome of the constructions that enter in t o the relationship are preverbal and hence often distortions of what is t a k ing p l ace. This is how Kelly viewed the phenomenon of trans ference, which especially involves those early dependency constructs that were mentioned above as having been framed in infancy and childhood. Since these are always formulated around parental figures, Kelly viewed trans- ference in the following manner: The psychoanalytic use of the te rm [trans ference ] seems altogether too loose for our purposes We .have there fore tightened up our use o f the term to re fer precisely to the ten- cLency o f any person to perceive another pre jucLicateLy as a repLicate o f a third person. En this sense, \"trans ference\" is not necessarily pathological, nor is the prejudgment neces sariLy pathologicaL, nor is the pr ejudgment necessari Ly antipathetic.\"' The dependency construct that underwrites transference is what we must understand, for it is invariably pre-emptive and often con- stricted — focused on some one type of person in life, such as a rejecting mother or a hostile father. Kelly did not believe that the thera- pist's task was to make clients nondependent. The task was rather to encourage through r econstruction a g r e ater d i spersion of d e - pendency. People need one another and must depend on one another if mental health is to be enjoyed by all. Dependency is not a one- way street. It is a mutual give-and-take. Kelly called the type of t r ansference we have been considering thus far — based on a kind of replay of role constructs from out of the past in terms of parental dependencies- secondary trans ference.\"' It is secondary be- cause nothing in the therapist's personality or physical appearance can account for why the c lient brings these constructs to bear in t h e relationship. However, a primary trans ference can also develop in the relationship, in which case a special construct is framed pre-emp- tively by the client to be applied to the per- son of the therapist.\"' The client may ideal- ize the therapist, turn him or her into a hero f igure, and consider the t h erapy hour t h e high point of any day. Kelly felt that primary transference is a great hindrance to eRective therapy, for it limits construction to the con- ference room (as opposed to life outside the relationship ) , distorts reality, and is if a n y - thing a kind of smokescreen the client throws up in order to avoid true experimentation. He insisted that w h e n p r i m a r y t r a n s f e rences arise, the therapist must behave in ways that will disconfirm them.\"' I f t h e c l i ent flatters the therapist for \"being nice,\" the therapist might begin acting a bit m or e a g gressively and threaten the client to some degree (all of this is ultimately discussed as therapy pro- ceeds, of course ). The worst thing that can happen is for a therapist to begin accepting the adulation and using the power of primary transferences in the relationship; this would be taken as a sign of countertrans ference.\"' Therapists who follow personal-construct theory do not make themselves complet ely open in a personal sense during psychother- apy — at least, not until therapy has gone on for some time. They are very sensitive to the fact that clients use their person as a source o f construct validation, and w ha t K e l l y i a n therapists want above all is to promote these validation eRorts outside the consulting room. C lients must learn that they can find m a n y ways in which t o v a l i d ate th ei r c o n structs, and that it is absolutely essential for them to assume personal responsibility in this regard. Hence, at times the therapist must begin to play a role in opposition to the rale the client has written for him o r he r i n t h e i d e a liza- tion of primary transference. Kelly even sug- gested that acting skills can be helpful to a"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Part III 738 K a n t ian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook client.\" \"' prospective therapist.\"' Since cure does not issue from some emotive bond of genuineness any more than i t i s s ues from d e t ailed in - sights, Kelly did not feel that a therapist has to become involved in the relationship liter ally as a p ersonality — revealing himself or herself as if to a close friend or confidant. On the other hand, the therapist does have to apply constantly a properly professional set of constructs, for \"the therapist who cannot ade- q uately construe his client w i t hi n a se t o f professional constructs runs the risk of trans- f erring hi s o w n d e p e n d encies upo n t h e Kelly found that his clients did not move through only one or two phases of transference, but that often the process went on throughout their contacts. Frequently what was taking place in transference depended on his or her attitude at the time. Hence, Kelly began to speak of tr ans ference cycles in psychother- apy.\"' Transference cycles typically begin in the secondary sense of attributing dependency constructs onto the therapist, which may then develop into the idealizations of primary trans- ference, before the cycle swings downward again as the client turns his or her attention elsewhere in life and the therapist takes on minor importance. However, a cycle can then be repeated, particularly if for some reason the therapist becomes the focus of a discussion or decision-making process. If countertransfer- e nce enters, cycles can be drawn out or r e - stimulated as well. Kelly defined resistance as a downward swing of the transference cycle, where we are likely to find clients countering their therapists, striking out to do more con- struing on their own outside of the consult- ing room, even if this goes against what the therapist might prefer.\"' T h erapists can also encourage resistance. For example, by inter- preting too early, the therapist might threaten of resistance. \" the client, bringing about a rapid constriction in the l a t t e r's l o osening p r o cesses which might then be seen by the therapist as an act Kelly would consider such resistances nor- mal tightening reactions in the face of threat, and he would chalk t hem o R t o e r r or s of therapeutic interpretation. However, the no- tion that a continuing resistance to the thera- pist must always take place if therapy is to proceed to a successful conclusion was con- strued by Kelly as arising from the fact that dependencies are being extended to more and more people. The therapist's lowering in the eyes of the client is also the therapist's gain, because this means the client is establishing role-relationships outside the therapy hour. \" All therapists want their clients to be resistive in this sense, even though the actual experi- ence of being taken out of central focus by the client may prove personally threatening at times. No one enjoys losing adulation, even if that idealized respect is not earned. Even so, Kelly insisted on his students accepting resistance as a natural course of therapy. If a therapist spoke of negative trans ference, Kelly interpreted this to mean something felt by the therapist and not t h e c l i e n t. \" A l l m o v e s away from exclusive dependence on the thera- pist toward distributing dependency to other people was taken by Kelly as a po sitive oc- When a transference cycle has settled and remained stable for some time, the therapist considers termination of therapy. At the very mention of termination, the client may revert to a more dependent pattern, wanting to re- kindle another transference c ycle, but th e therapist should have by this tim e acquired the confidence that this is not necessary and thus carry out plans for ending the sessions.

Enactments are usually very brief, not lasting more than a few minutes in ordinary therapy. It is also important to avoid e n acting caricatures of people. The more lifelike we can make the role play the greater are the chances that the client will benefit. Of course, there is room in working out a role play for the client to ex- periment and thereby depart from his or her typical approach to others. The thexapist can also enact the client in a somewhat altered manner, providing grounds fo r r e c onstruc- Enactment P ersonal-construct therapists like t o b r i n g their sessions alive by setting up r o l e play- situations with their clients, designed to elicit the latter's construction of life events. Kelly defined role playing in the following terms: \"The therapist may tentatively present a care- fully calculated point of view in such a way t hat the client, through coming t o u n d e r - stand it, may develop a basis for understand- i ng othex figures in hi s e n v ironment w i t h whom he needs to acquire skill in p l a y i ng interacting roles.\" \"' Assume that Harry, a c l i ent i n p s y cho- therapy, complains at one point that his boss is always picking on him. A K e l l yian therapist would be very likely to enter into a spontane- o us role p la y w i t h H a r r y , p r o b a bl y b y abruptly saying something like, \"When you s ay your boss picks on you, w ha t d o y o u mean> He says, 'Haven't you got that work finished yet ~' or something to t ha t eRect > Well, when he talks that way what do you s ay ~ Answer me i n y o u r t y p i c a l w a y - 'Haven't you got that work fi n i shed yet>' \" We introduce such on-the-spot acting with- out fanfare so as not to threaten Haxry, who might get tied into knots when told that he will be expected to re-enact his past life in therapy ox some such. Gradually, Harry will be brought deeper into the technique as the role-play situations grow longer and more in- volved. Kelly would also insist. that when the roles became anything more than simply a clarifying example of the sort just presented, H arry and hi s t h e rapist should play b o t h roles. This is called role reversal. In playing his boss after first portraying himself, Harry will get a d i Rerent perspective on the role relationship under study, and the reverse is true for the therapist. As constructive alter- nativists, we are always ready to see things from more than just one perspective. tion in this manner as well. Self-Characterization and' Fixed Role Thera-py Although a certain insight can be obtained from enacting roles with the therapist during the regular session, a far g r eater potential for experimentation and r e construction li es outside the consulting room in the life sphere itself. Kelly believed that clients should ap- proach their daily lives with a construct sys- tem that is not of t h eir u sual choosing — all w ith a sense of \"let's pretend.\" \"' T h i s c a n be done by first rewriting th e c l i e nt's cus- tomary constructs, giving the person an essen- tially new scenario regarding life, and then e ncouraging him or h e r t o e x p e r i m ent b y living according to the modified construction system. The Rep Test can help here, but in addition, Kelly relied on what h e t e r med a self characterization x (-etch. After Harry has been in therapy for several weeks, his thera- pist might say to him, \" I want you to w r i t e a character sketch of Harry Brown, just as if h e were the principal character in a p l a y ."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Part III 740 Ka n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook W rite it as it m i gh t b e w r i t ten by a f r i e n d who knows hi m v ery in t i m a t e ly a nd v e r y sympathetically, perhaps better than anyone ever really could know him. Be sure to write it in the third person F.or example, start out by saying, ' Harry Brown i s . . . ' \" ' \" Harry will p r o duce a statement running anywhere from a few paragraphs to possibly several pages of self-description. The next step is for the therapist — usually with the help of other professional therapists — to write out a tired role based on what Harry has said about himself, as well as w hat ha s a l ready been learned of him in therapy to this point. What this comes down to is a role written in con- trast to the role that Harry has written for h imself in the self-characterization.\" K e l l y suggested that the new r ol e should always remove impermeable constructions, consider available validation for the constructs intro- d uced, and include a f r a m ework fo r c o n - struing others to aid in establishing role rela- t ionships. Roles t ha t i n c l u d e n o t i o n s o f f inancial wealth for a cl ient l i v ing i n n e a r - poverty conditions or other wildly unrealistic suggestions are pointless. Finally, Harry must be made aware that this is a make-believe ex- perimental effort, and that no matter how he may find other people responding to his con- trived change in behavior, he has the protec- tion of experime ntal fantasy to reassure him. He is, in th e fi na l a n a lysis, the person in c harge of what is t a k in g p l ace during t h e fixed-role experiment. Harry's role would p r obably i n v olve a more assertive pattern of speaking up when being victimized by his boss or other domi- n ant people. If di rectly speaking up i s n o t suggested, then p ossibly some a l t e rnative form of behavior might be fr amed, such as appearing relaxed and inviting cr i ticism in relation to the boss rather than cowering as he now does. Possibly the role would have Harry begin criticizing himself and /or other people — beating his superior to the punch, so to speak. Whatever role would eventuate, it would be written broadly enough to enable Harry to move permeably within alternatives. That is, we do not want the client to follow specific instructions, but rather to get the gen- eral theme of a different approach to life in which he or she could t he n s p o ntaneously It is clear from everything that Kelly wrote on the topic that fixed-role therapy is not a manipulative device to subtly an d c o v ertly control client behavior.'\" H a rr y i s not being encouraged simply to act more assertively in the fixed role, and when he is through with this experiment, he may well return to exactly t he same sort of person that he was at t h e o utset. As long as he has come to view lif e from the opposite side of the behavioral street, h owever, and to see what it i s l i k e t o b e a m ore critical, bossy person himself, he w i l l have gained something of v i ta l i m p o r t ance from the experiment performed. He can grasp t he impact of hi s m a n ner o n o t h er s m o r e clearly now for he has taken the role of the \"other,\" a capacity that is essential to under- standing and healthy role r el ationships. In fixed-role therapy, the client wr i tes the first script, the clinician-therapist the second, and the final life plan remains to be worked out. Hence, Kelly defined this technique as fol- lows: \"Fixea' role therapy i-s a sheer creative process in tvhich therapist and client conjoin their talents. Any attempt to make it a repair process rather than a creative process seems t o result in some measure of failure.\"'\" H i s hope was that a fresh personality, of the cli- ent's own choosing, would emerge.\"' Fixed-role therapy is ordinarily conducted for an eight-week period, though there is no h ard and fast rule to follow h e re.\" ' C l i e n t s a re often fascinated by t h e i m p a c t t h e i r create variations."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i nd s of Constructive Theories: Jean Piaget and George A.

As Harry reports back on what his wife or boss did in reaction to his altered pattern of behavior, the therapist focuses on these issues and through f urther role play helps him w or k t h r o u g h d ifficult situations. Harry fi nd s s ome m a r - velous opportunities in this process for mak- ing propositional and permeable constructions of his life events. The first sign of progress will probably occur when Harry informs the therapist that new elements are falling into place in his construction system. He sees now why such-and-thus seems to happen, or he feels in empathy with his boss for doing what he does at times.\"' Though we have not writ- ten his role for this manipulative purpose, it would be possible for Harry to find h i m self in the new role and take it over fairly com- pletely in time.

A.lthough elab- o rations of this sort could be d one i n c o n - sidering an interpretation of the past, Kelly usually tried to orient th e c l i ent's thinking forward in time, trying to anticipate and pre- dict the future, and this in turn usually clari- fied and reorganized the construction sys- tem.484 The Use of Dreams Dreams were viewed by Kelly as \"the most l oosened construction that one can put i n t o words,\" \"' and t hey are often pr ompted by preverbal constructs.'\" Kelly thought it point- l ess to believe t ha t s o m ethin g a s v a g u e as a dream can have a si n g le me a ning.\"' F reud's so-called latent d r e a m c o n t ent i s probably the submerged pole of a construct. Of course, dreams can sometimes make sense if we interpret their imagery in a n o p p osi- tional sense.\"' This is similar to slot move- ment in that a person is likely to try the other side of the conceptual street when in a dream or even a conscious reverie (daydream ). This is the reason we are sometimes shocked by what we spontaneously \"think of,\" even while awake. We picture our beloved parent full of life, and in th e n ext i n stant w e see the same loved one dead and lying i n a co ffin . Dreams skip about like this because they play both ends of our construct poles oR against each other. K elly did not have a formal r ole for t h e dream in his therapy, except in this sense of taking it as a sign of the possible beginnings of loosened thinking. Sometimes this loosen- ing suggested the beginnings of movement. Kelly did not routinely ask the client to re- Controlled F/aboration We have already seen above that a major task of the therapist is to help the client elaborate t he presenting complaint. H o w ever, K e l l y further refined this general therapeutic role into a technique he called controlled elabora tion. In using controlled elaboration, we take up large sections of a c l i ent's construction system and try to m ak e th e c o ntents inter- nally consistent so that they can be put to ex- perimental test. The C-P-C Cycle might be used in this eRort. A t h e r apist using con- trolled elaboration might say to th e c l i ent, \" Let us think t h r o ugh ho w t h i s w o ul d b e d one and how i t w o u l d t u r n o u t i n t h e end.\" \"' In laying plans for the future, we of necessity must pull our thoughts together in anticipation of what will lead to what, how"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Part III 742 Ka n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook p ort dreams, but he felt t hat i f i t w e r e o f sufFicient impact on the client to be brought up spontaneously, he would at least want to hear the dream story out. He was interested in the loosened construction and not the con- tent of the dream per se. He was opposed to those approaches which see dreams as reflect- ing symbols.\"' If a d r e a m h e r a l d ed s ome movement, Kelly would interpret this to the client in light of th eir ongoing discussion as a form o f c o n t r o l led el aboration. For e x - ample, a female patient who was beginning to wrestle with her passive approach to life might begin dreaming that she was bound and gagged.

Reciprocal and negational reversibility enables the maturing child to think reflexively, to b r in g t h o u ght into examination self-critically. Another im- portant construct in Piagetian theory is that of the operation. Operational thinking sum- marizes all that can be said about cognition. Operations are interiorized actions having the property of reversibility, but also retaining an identifiable structure that can be r elated to other operations. Operations never exist en- tirely alone in thought. Operational thinking begins at a concrete level and then gradually develops (evolves ) to i n c reasingly abstract levels of cognitive thought. Piaget refers to imagination as representation, an operation that is identical whether w e a r e p r e sently looking at an object (perception ) or recalling it mentally (memory ). Very abstract represen- tations are what we mean by \"concepts,\" and by using these, we \"think.\" Mind is therefore a continuing process of constructive activity, with a large amount of self-construction in- volved. Intelligence arises when we establish permanent r elations between schema t h a t cover greater and greater spatiotemporal in- tervals. This ability for mind to t ake on per- m anent conceptual organizations i s w h a t Piaget means by conservation. Mathematical insights exist as fixed structures with gr eat c onservative value, no matter who i t i s t h a t reasons them out. Piaget interprets the feed- back loop of cybernetics theory as a means of r etaining structure w i t hi n c h a n ge , a s e l f - regulatory process akin to equilibration which a lso retains the in tegrity o f t h e s t r u c t u r ed process. Human beings differ from c omput- ers, however, in t h a t t h e y c a n t r a n s f o r m themselves and become more complex. Piaget's genetic epistemology bridges the gap between body and mind by suggesting that a scheme can be interiorized (cognitively ) of the physical motions made (reflexively ) by the organism, and that subsequently this pat- terned relationship can combine into increas- ingly abstract structures or s t r u ctured sys- tems. Human beings can therefore transform themselves and their environments intellec- t ually and n o t o n l y o r g a n i c ally t h r o u g h changes in species. As used by Piaget, the term construction m e a ns the c r e ation of a structure (scheme ) through o n g oing p r o - c esses of both a n o r g a ni c a n d c o g n i t i v e nature. Thanks to t h e o ff setting cognitive processes of assimilation (taking-in of envi- ronmental factors ) and accommodation (re- modifying behavior due t o e x p e rience ) > a reciprocal influence is possible in cognition leading to equilibration. When assimilation brings about a disequilibration, the organism is motivated to b r in g a ccommodation into play to thereby achieve a new level of equi- librium. T hi s b a l ancing p r ocess effectively results in new learning. Piaget discusses many cognitive processes in light of their contribu- tion to this equilibrating process, such as in- duction, deduction, and tr ansduction. Cen- tered thought is glued concretely to merely that which is perceived, whereas more crea- tive thinking calls for decentrations."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Part III 744 Ka n t ian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook Piaget notes that all behavior is teleonomic, that is, goal-oriented. Personality is the total system of interrelating schemata and opera- tions that are made possible by these struc- tures, occurring across the sensorimotor, in- tellectual, and affective (emotional ) levels of behavior. Though he accepts the fact that hu- man beings are self-directing actors, Piaget is not sympathetic with theories of agency such as we find in Jung, Adler, Rogers, Boss, or B inswanger. Th e s e l f o r c o g n i t i v e s e l f (image) that we are aware of as human be- ings is itself a schema framed by operational thinking. Earliest thought is egocentric and anthropomorphic, or precausal, in nature, so that children confuse their personal construc- tions with the objects they see around them- a ttributing h u m a n l i k e c h a r a c teristics t o clouds, trees, and so on. Consciousness arises when the environmental situation blocks the person from continuing some ongoing ac- tivity. Piaget rejects the psychoanalytical in- terpretation of unconscious symbolisms. He would say that s o-called repression occurs when the person refuses to accept what reality demands as an accommodation, but instead persists in assimilating reality to an egocen- tric schema which is unadaptive. Piaget does not object to the view that dr eams may be wish fulfillments, as long as we appreciate that a wish is nothing more than the person' s effort to assimilate reality to the self. Piaget is probably best known for his de- tailed study of the stages of development. In- fancy is the period of life from birth to age two, dominated by reflexive behaviors. Suck- i ng is the first m ajor reflex, providing th e child with a n i n i t i a l s c hema for c o gnitive growth. Reflex cycles move into circular re- actions as the child practices actions like head- turning, assimilating experience to such ac- tions and accommodating them in turn. Piaget calls these early efforts reproductive assimila- tions. Percepts and habits are structured in time. Children in the second year of life have a practical, sensorimotor intelligence. Action schemata dominate cognitive life as the child learns how hands work, where the mouth is located, and so on. The schemata are also re- lated to each other via what is called a recip- rocal assimilation. By the end of the second year, the child's sensorimotor intelligence in- cludes a sense of surrounding space, the per- ception of objects in space, a notion of how one event brings another about, and a begin- ning sense of time's passage. Early childhood covers the ages of roughly two to seven years. This is the time of early gropings for a social existence, moving out of the egocentricity of infancy. Children model their parents as ego ideals. This is still a pe- riod of preoperational thinking, however, in which the person relies on c h i l d hood ani- mism, intuition, and semilogic. Moral realism typifies this period, so that rules are followed concretely and without insight into the prin- ciples lying behind them. Self-evaluation be- gins in early childhood. Late childhood extends from age seven to twelve years. The child becomes more cog- nizant of self factors through i n t ernal di a- logue. Conservation reflects development in the child s cognitions during this period, as the child's thought is progressing from intui- tion and semilogic t o r e v e r sible t h o u ght. Piaget specifies the age of seven or eight as the time of life in which concrete operations first appear — that is, those that bear on ma- nipulable obj ects (things ) ra.ther than on propositions (abstractions ). Over the period of late childhood, rational thought continues to evolve, as reflected in a growing capacity to group items and examine them c oncep- tually through reversibility. The morality of constraint (rule-following ) of the earlier pe- riod begins to develop to a morality of co- operation, in which justice supplants routine."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Chapter 11 Two K i nd s oi C onstructive Theories; J ean Piaget and George A. Kelly 7 4 5 Because of this, the first moral conflicts arise in late childhood. The final stage of development is adoles- cence, which carries the person forward t o adulthood. Beginning s o m e t im e b e t w e en eleven and thirteen years of age the develop- ment of formal operations occurs. The person can now use general ideas and abstract con- structions. Thought b e c omes self-reflexive and propositional, thanks to the reversibility and dialectical features of such abstractions. Whereas the self is a pr i m i t ive, hence ego- centric schema of i d entity, th e p e rsonality that emerges in adolescence takes into account ideals and aspirations beyond just the self. Piaget's conception of p e r sonality borrows from the notion of character — that is, an eval- uation of behavioral tendencies. Piaget would view fixation in the Jungian vein, as a failure to progress beyond a certain level, resulting usually in errors in judgment when the per- son behaves in relation to others. Imitation of others' behavior is viewed as the primacy of accommodation over assimilation, and the adolescent is often prone to imitate in the so- c alled gang age. Identification is a s i m i l ar idea. There are many behavioral patterns pos- sible in life, so that Piaget accepts a broad range of individual differences, even though he dislikes categorizing people. He also dis- likes tracing the differences in people's behav- ior to explanations relying on language ac- quisition a nd the shaping o f t h e p e r s o n through social pressures. Piaget's theory of abnormality would combine his constructs of disequilibration and fixation over the years of development. In George Kelly, we find a different — more clearly and t o t a ll y K a n t i an — constructivist. Construing is viewed by Kelly as a process of framing interpretations about life, trying in a sense to capture that w h ic h r e c urs i n a dichotomous frame known as the construct. In a construct, there are at least two elements that are similar and they contrast with a third. Constructs are t hu s r e l a t i onships between things that seem alike (similarity ) and yet differ from something else (contrast ). They a re like t r a n sparent p a t t erns o r t e m p l e t s through which the person makes predictions about life's continually unfolding future. Con- structive alternativism (Kelly's philosophy ) suggests that there is always more than one way to slice the pie of experience. We can always reconstrue a set of circumstances and thereby place an alternative construction on what we know about things. Constructs form into interlocking relations known as the construction system. This system is ordinal, so that t h er e ar e s u perordinate (more abstract ) and subordinate (less ab- stract ) constructs. The former can subsume or take the latter under their range of conven- ience — that is, their definitional meaning. Con- s tructs can dilate or e x t end t h ei r r a ng e o f convenience, as they can constrict and focus in on a narrow referent. Constructs can be said to loosen or tighten. Permeable constructs readily take on new e l ements of m e a ning, whereas the impermeable constructs do not admit of new possibilities. Pre-emptive con- structs fix rigid, either-or distinctions, and the c onstellatory construct perm it s i t s e l e m e n t s to belong to more than one realm of m e a n- ing at the same time. A construct that leaves its elements open to new construction — as in accepting new evidence — is termed a proposi- tional construct. T h er e ar e c o m p r e h ensive c onstructs that subsume a w i d e v a r i et y o f events, and there are i n c i dental c o n structs that are more limited in their referent. We human beings f or m s e l f - constructs, which is what we mean when we speak about our identities. Kelly was more accepting of an identity conception than Piaget, just as he was purely a p s y c h ological co n structivist. There is no mention of organic constructions"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Part III 746 Ka n tian Models in the Phenomenological Outlook in the psychology of personal constructs. Per- sonal constructs enable us to control what we do as we move th rough l i fe . I n t erpersonal relations encourage the person to frame role relationships. The role is a pattern of behav- ior defined by the individual such that one person construes the construction processes of another person. We make an i n terpretation of what others are thinking about us, and then working on this assumption, we frame a role construct. We may err i n t h i s i n t e r - pretation, but our behavior will depend on it even so. The most central conceptions of this type which define our relationship to other people Kelly termed the core-role constructs. Kelly did not like drive-reduction theories of learning. He, like A d l er, saw the person a s a process, as behaving an d c h a n g i ng through reconstruction when necessary, but always contributing to his or her determina- tion of behavior. Freedom to behave is just another way of t a l k in g a b out th e a l t e rna- tive construction people can always place on events. Change in c o n struction systems is said to follow one of tw o c o urses. First, we have the C-P-C Cycle, in which the person begins circumspectly by looking at all sides of an issue, using propositional constructions. After considering possible alternatives, the person pre-empts one and only one course of action. This alternative then controls behav- i or in the course of events to f o ll ow. T h e second method of changing behavior follows a loosening-to-tightening process of employ- ing constructs, which Kelly termed the Cre- ativity Cycle. Kelly thought of emotional be- havior as either loosely defined construction or some preverbal construction which has per- sisted in the construction system. The feelings of threat and st ress signal that o n e's core- role constructs are not wor k ing c ompletely and hence might require change. Anxiety is t he extreme result of b eing caught i n l i f e with one's core constructs inadequate to the task of predicting and c o n t r olling (under- standing and anticipating ) the course of life events. Kelly thought of aggression in much the same way that the existentialists think of commitment, that is, as an active elaboration o f the construction system, He f a v ored th i s style of behavior over the passivity of an in- d ividual who does not seek t o e x t end t h e range and diversity of the construct system or does so only tentatively. Kelly drew a dis- tinction between aggression and h o s t i l ity. Hostile persons insist on using the same bank- rupt constructs even though they do not pre- d ict and control life w e ll . T h e e m o t ion o f guilt occurs when the person feels dislodged from his or her role structure. This is where conscience or superego would be p l aced in Kellyian theory. Though Kelly did not care much for th e Freudian defense mechanisms, he did offer alternative definitions in light of hi s t h eory. Repression is the suspension or stopping of t he construing p r ocess. Incorporation i s a w illingness on the part of a p e r son t o s e e other people like himself or h e rself. Identi- that our group — including family members- have already been using. Regression is due to behavior that is predicated on preverbal or im- mature constructions of li fe. Pr ojection is a special case of hostility in w h ic h th e person forces his bankrupt constructions onto others. Reaction-formation is an attempt to put an o pposite construct pole into effect when it i s the other pole that bears significance for a person. Kelly did not propose a stage theory of development, though he did emphasize the importance of other people to proper matura- tion. He disliked the Rankian-Rogerian talk of seeking independence from others, feeling instead that e a rl y d e p e n d ency c o n s t ructs framed around parents had to be extended to more and more people with development.

Kelly 747 cial interest here, though he called it a di s- persion of dependency. This is why societies arise in the first place, because people are de- pendent on each other, and cultural norms arise because a group of people come to con- s true existence in a c ommon way. K e l l y shared a dislike for categorizing people with other theorists in the phenomenological tradi- tion. Personality styles of either a type or trait variety can always be seen to depend on the unique construction system fashioned by the person in question. Kelly's theory of illness holds that people who repeatedly bring to b ear i n v a lid c o n- structions of life eventually become malad- justed. For whatever reason, the abnormal person is wracked with anxiety or projecting distorted views of reality or behaving in a hos- tile manner, and so on, because of an un - w orkable construction system which he o r she cannot reconstrue. Symptoms of disorder reflect the rationale the person accepts for this inability to c o ntrol o r p r e d ict l i fe — due to strange physical losses (hysteria ), terrifying fears (phobias), or intruding f o rces of un - k nown or i g i n s (schizophrenic delusions ) . Kelly fashioned a Role Construct Repertory Test (Rep Test ), which could help the thera- pist understand the client's construct system, r educing, through a special form of f a c t or analysis, the various reference frames to a few core constructs. Neurotics reflect much anxiety but are trying to frame new construc- tions of events (reconstrue ). Psychotics have settled on a bizarre delusional or hallucina- t ory solution t o t h e i r p r o b l ems o f l i v i n g . Hysterics convert their psychological prob- lems to a physical rationale. Obsessive-com- pulsive clients use tightening as a d efense against their failing construction system. Psy- chopaths fail to frame genuine role relation- ships with others. Depressed clients tend to constrict and manic clients dilate their con- structs. Schizophrenic constructions are the Kelly's theory of cure builds on the idea of reconstruction, for to th e extent t hat p eo- ple can control and predict their l i ves they can solve their p roblems by themselves and achieve mental health. Kelly saw his th era- p eutic role as helping clients to \" r o t ate th e axes\" on life and come at things anew with spoke of the process of change in therapy as movement, beginning in an elaboration of the p resenting complaint and g o in g o n t o t h e more involved aspects, using the C-P-C and Creativity Cycles. Interpretations are made by the client, assisted by the organized instruc- tion of the t h erapist who h e lp s th e c l i e nt know what his or her construction system i s, h ow it is failing, and how i t m i g h t b e i m - proved. Sometimes old problems cannot be solved, and it i s b e s t t o e n c a p sulate them through a time-binding technique. Kelly al- ways took a credulous attitude wit h c l i e nts, accepting and supporting them in every way so that through such reassurance they would begin reconstruction. So-called transference is due to di stortions i n t h e c l i e n t ' s c o n s truc- tions, stemming from earlier life (secondaiy transference ) or from the actual regard the client has for the therapist (primary trans- ference ) . The latter f or m o f t r a n s f e r ence hinders therapy. Kelly saw therapy as a series o f transference cycles, in which t h e c l i e n t moves from being highly drawn to the thera- p ist to a p e r io d o f i n c r e asing c onflict o r resistance as the client tightens construction in the face of threat. Kelly did riot really ac- cept the idea of negative transference, feeling that if it occurs, it is probably brought on by the therapist rather than the client. Kelly used the technique of enactment or role play extensively. He also e m p l oyed a self-characterization technique preliminary to fixed-role therapy, in which a client was asked alternative constructions that work better.
