Dorsolateral PFC function, as well as both fluid and crystal- lized cognitive ability, was positively related to Openness/Intellect but no other personality trait. Additionally, facet level analysis supported the characterization of Openness/Intellect as a primarily cognitive trait. SOURCES OF OPENNESS/INTELLECT: COGNITIVE AND NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF THE FIFTH FACTOR OF PERSONALITY Factor analyses of trait-descriptive adjectives and sentence-based questionnaires have indicated that the vast majority of personality descriptions can be classified using five broad domains, often called the Big Five or Five-Factor Model (Costa & McCrae, 1992a; Dig- man, 1990; Goldberg, 1990; John & Srivastava, 1999). Analyses of languages other than English suggest that slight variations in the content of these domains, and at least one additional domain, may be necessary to improve the cross-cultural validity of the taxonomy (Ashton et al., 2004; Saucier & Goldberg, 2001). Nonetheless, the Big Five provides a useful organizing system for personality psy- chology, directing inquiry and providing a common language for researchers. What this descriptive taxonomy does not provide, however, is any explanation of the sources of personality, and a bi- ological approach, like that employed by Depue and Collins (1999) in their neuropsychological model of Extraversion, may provide deeper theoretical frameworks for the Big Five (cf. McCrae & Costa, 1999). In what follows, we propose a neuropsychological model of Open- ness/Intellect, the fifth and most controversial domain, and we present a study offering support for one aspect of the model through exploration of the cognitive and neuropsychological correlates of Openness/Intellect. We are interested primarily in the immediate sources of this personality factor in the brain and its ongoing func- tions, rather than genetic or environmental sources. Studies reveal- ing the heritability of the Big Five to be around 50% indicate that the more distal influences shaping personality lie both in the genes and in the environment where development occurs (Bouchard, 1994; Reimann, Angleitner, & Strelau, 1997). Genes and environment alike, however, must make their mark on the brain, if they are to affect personality. 826 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Openness/Intellect has been the focus of considerable disagree- ment in debates on how best to characterize and label the Big Five domains. ‘‘Intellect’’ is the label for this domain most commonly used in the lexical tradition (Digman, 1990; Goldberg, 1992), while ‘‘Openness to Experience’’ was chosen by Costa and McCrae (1985, 1992a, 1992b), leaders in the questionnaire approach. Both of these labels are generally preferred to a third alternative, ‘‘Culture,’’ which was used in one of the first demonstrations of the five-factor model (John & Srivastava, 1999; Tupes & Christal, 1961/1992). The current trend toward a compound label, ‘‘Openness/Intellect’’ (e.g., Ashton, Lee, Vernon, & Jang, 2000; Saucier, 2003), highlights the fact that these two labels complement each other by identifying different as- pects of the same domain. In both lexical and questionnaire models, the fifth factor is associated with traits that might be labeled ‘‘Intel- lect’’ (e.g., intellectuality and intelligence), traits that might be labe- led ‘‘Openness’’ (e.g., imagination, unconventionality, interest in art), and traits for which either label would be appropriate (e.g., cu- riosity, creativity) (John & Srivastava, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 1997; Saucier, 1992). While there is sufficient overlap between the lexical and questionnaire models to assume that Openness and Intellect re- fer the same domain of personality, the differences in emphasis be- tween the lexical and questionnaire approaches have led to slightly different operationalizations of this domain in instruments used to measure the Big Five (Digman, 1990; John & Srivastava, 1999; Sau- cier, 1992). Of the five factors, Openness/Intellect typically shows the lowest correlations between lexical and questionnaire measures (e.g., Goldberg, 1992). One purpose of the present study was to compare the most common lexical and questionnaire measures of Openness/ Intellect—Goldberg’s (1992) 100 unipolar trait-descriptive adjectives (TDA) and Costa and McCrae’s (1992b) Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R)—in terms of their cognitive and neuropsy- chological correlates. McCrae and Costa’s (1997; McCrae, 1993, 1994) argument that ‘‘Intellect’’ is too narrow a descriptor to capture the domain ade- quately has been helpful in drawing attention to the full range of phenomena needing explanation in any model of Openness/Intellect. Our neuropsychological model is guided, in part, by their assertion that ‘‘Openness is seen in the breadth, depth, and permeability of consciousness, and in the recurrent need to enlarge and examine experience’’ (McCrae and Costa, 1997, p. 826). This description Sources of Openness/Intellect 827"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"captures two key components of Openness/Intellect, which may point toward its sources: a motivational component, having to do with interest in novelty and complexity, and a cognitive component, having to do with the manner in which information is processed and organized. Openness/Intellect in Relation to the Higher-Order Factors of the Big Five Our understanding of both components is informed by our inter- pretation of the higher-order factor solution for the Big Five. While the Big Five has typically been considered the most general level of personality description and the highest level of a hierarchical model of personality, findings that the five factors are intercorrelated and group consistently into two higher-order factors suggest otherwise. The higher-order factor solution, reported by Digman (1997) and replicated by DeYoung, Peterson, and Higgins (2002), reveals that Emotional Stability (Neuroticism reversed), Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness form a first factor, while Extraversion (sometimes labeled ‘‘Surgency’’) and Openness/Intellect form a second. We have offered an interpretation of these higher-order factors, or metatraits, as Stability and Plasticity , respectively (DeYoung et al., 2002). Sta- bility and Plasticity can be considered the manifestation in person- ality of two overarching concerns of any organism: (1) the need to maintain a stable physical/behavioral organization to achieve vari- ous goals and (2) the need to incorporate novel information into that organization, as the state of the organism changes both internally (developmentally) and externally (environmentally). As personality traits, Stability and Plasticity reflect individual differences in the emphasis on, competence in, and capacity for meeting each of these two general needs in the ways characteristic of human beings. 1 1. Our interpretation is compatible with Digman’s (1997) suggestion that the higher-order factors might be associated with socialization and personal growth. Stability seems likely to make a child easier to socialize (and socialization may encourage Stability), while Plasticity seems likely (though not inevitably) to lead to personal growth. The labels ‘‘Stability’’ and ‘‘Plasticity’’ are intended to suggest underlying dispositions or traits rather than possible outcomes and to communi- cate more theoretical content than Digman’s (1997) labels, ‘‘ a ’’ and ‘‘ b ,’’ which he described as ‘‘provisional’’ (p. 1248). McCrae and Costa (1999) offered an alter- native explanation for the higher-order factors: that they merely reflect biases in personality assessment, along two evaluative dimensions—Positive Valence (PV) 828 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We have also proposed a provisional biological model (DeYoung et al., 2002), linking individual differences in Stability to variation in the function of the serotonergic system (governing emotional and motivational regulation; Spoont, 1992), and differences in Plasticity to variation in the dopaminergic system (governing encounter with novelty and incentive reward; Depue & Collins, 1999; Panksepp, 1998). Our intention in the current article is not so much to offer new evidence for our interpretation of the higher-order factors, as to draw inferences from it in creating a more detailed model of Open- ness/Intellect. 2 For this purpose, we are interested in Plasticity, the tendency to engage actively and flexibly with novelty—in other words, to explore. We have argued that Extraversion reflects a more concrete, behavioral exploratory tendency, while Openness/ Intellect reflects a more abstract, cognitive exploratory tendency (DeYoung et al., 2002). This characterization is supported by a re- cent study demonstrating that Extraversion scales are dominated by items reflecting behavioral traits, while Openness/Intellect scales are dominated by cognitive traits (Pytlik Zillig, Hemenover, & Dienst- bier, 2002). In both concrete and abstract domains, the exploratory tendency is likely to be regulated, at least in part, by the neuromodulator do- pamine. The dopaminergic system is particularly responsive to nov- elty, and its activation triggers exploratory behavior (Panksepp, 1998). Depue and Collins (1999) have made a strong case for the regulation of Extraversion by dopamine, noting that both the per- sonality factor and the neurotransmitter have been linked to incen- tive reward sensitivity, positive affect, and approach behavior (cf. and Negative Valence (NV). However, in earlier work they found that PV and NV were not associated with biased self-reports of the Big Five (McCrae & Costa, 1995). The fact that the two evaluative factors are similar to the higher-order factors in their associations with the Big Five (McCrae & Costa, 1999), but do not appear linked to biased personality ratings, suggests instead that very general evaluations (like ‘‘superior’’ or ‘‘wicked’’) tend to reflect the two broadest factors of personality. 2. The constructs of Stability and Plasticity are in no way intended to replace the Big Five—in a hierarchical model of personality, traits may be meaningfully dis- tinct on one level, despite being grouped within a more general trait at a higher level. Consideration of the higher-order factor solution may aid in understanding how and why the Big Five are related to each other, without diminishing their importance. Sources of Openness/Intellect 829"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Lucas, Diener, Grob, Suh, & Shao, 2000). A similar case can be made for Openness, based on the empirically identified relations be- tween dopaminergic function and response to novelty, decreased la- tent inhibition, and cognitive function. The following review is divided in terms of dopaminergic pathways and brain structures likely to be associated with both Openness/Intellect and Extraver- sion, and those likely to be unique to Openness/Intellect. The Big Five are such broad personality traits that one must assume them to be multiply determined. Our model therefore proposes that Open- ness/Intellect depends on a number of interacting brain systems, all of which appear to be responsible for rendering the individual cog- nitively exploratory and flexible. Sources of Openness/Intellect Shared with Extraversion McCrae and Costa (1997, p. 826, quoted above) emphasize the role of novelty in their descriptions of both the cognitive and motiva- tional components of Openness: Open people are ‘‘permeable’’ to new ideas and experiences; they are motivated to ‘‘enlarge’’ their experience into novel territory and to ‘‘examine’’ their experience, discovering novelty even in the previously familiar. While the do- paminergic system is often characterized as a reward system, Schultz and colleagues (Schultz, 1998; Waelti, Dickinson, & Schultz, 2001) have demonstrated that it responds not to reward as such, but to unexpected rewards or unexpected predictors of reward–—that is, to positive stimuli characterized by some degree of novelty. 3 Because increases in dopaminergic activity appear to be associated with greater responsiveness to the positive aspects of novelty (Panksepp, 1998), dopamine seems likely to regulate the motivational compo- nent of Openness/Intellect, in a manner similar to its regulation of Extraversion (Depue & Collins, 1999). Dopamine may also regulate the cognitive permeability associated with Openness/Intellect. Peterson and colleagues (Peterson & Car- son, 2000; Peterson, Smith, & Carson, 2002) have demonstrated that both Extraversion and Openness/Intellect are associated with 3. While ‘‘novelty’’ is often used to mean something totally unfamiliar, it can also be applied to a familiar stimulus that appears unpredictably or in an unfamiliar context or pattern. More generally, novelty as the totally unfamiliar may be con- sidered a subset of the class of all things unpredicted, and it is this larger class that we mean by ‘‘novelty.’’ 830 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"decreased latent inhibition, and that the linear combination of the two traits (i.e., Plasticity) yields the strongest effect. Latent inhibition is a low-level cognitive phenomenon, wherein previously nonpredictive, ignored, or irrelevant stimuli are inhibited from entering awareness. It was first described in rats, which show slower learning of the predictive value of a conditioned stimulus if that stimulus has previously been shown to them repeatedly without any associated reinforcer (Lubow, 1989). Analogous paradigms reveal latent inhibition in other mam- malian species, including humans (Lubow, 1989; Lubow & Gewirtz, 1995). In all species examined, latent inhibition varies in strength across individuals. In both rats and humans, dopaminergic antago- nists increase latent inhibition (Shadach, Feldon, & Weiner, 1999; Weiner & Feldon, 1987), while dopaminergic agonists decrease latent inhibition (Kumari et al., 1999; Weiner, Lubow, & Feldon, 1988). Latent inhibition appears to be an adaptation to the vast com- plexity of the environment relative to any organism’s limited ability to attend to and model features of that environment. As a precon- scious gating mechanism, latent inhibition allows phenomena already categorized as irrelevant to be ignored without further high- er-level processing, thereby conserving resources. At the same time, however, latent inhibition renders the individual less permeable to previously ignored information that might become relevant and use- ful as his or her needs and situation change over time. The relative decrease in latent inhibition associated with Openness/Intellect and Extraversion (with its attendant increase in permeability to new in- formation) may have adaptive consequences, leading to greater flex- ibility in processing information and exploring the environment. Carson, Peterson, and Higgins (2003), for example, have demon- strated that decreased latent inhibition is associated with greater real-life creative achievement, at least among high-achieving univer- sity undergraduates. (Notably, Openness/Intellect positively predict- ed the same measure of creative achievement; Carson, Peterson, & Higgins, in press). Decreased latent inhibition is not always associ- ated with positive outcomes, however. Schizophrenia and schizotypy are both associated with decreased latent inhibition (Gray et al., 1995; Lubow, 1989). Remarkably, even this association is consistent with the involvement of dopamine in Openness/Intellect, as schizo- typy is positively correlated with Openness (Ross, Lutz, & Bailley, 2002) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders are associated with ab- normalities of dopaminergic function (Gray et al., 1995). Sources of Openness/Intellect 831"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Unique Sources of Openness/Intellect The association of both Extraversion and Openness/Intellect with positive response to novelty and decreased latent inhibition, phe- nomena known to be dopaminergically regulated, may help to ex- plain why these two traits group together in a higher-order factor. Nonetheless, Extraversion and Openness/Intellect are readily differ- entiated at the Big Five level both conceptually and statistically (zero-order correlations between the two traits range from about .2 to .6; e.g., Digman, 1997), and one would probably be justified in considering them more different than similar. Any model of the sources of Openness/Intellect, therefore, must explain what is unique to Openness/Intellect as well as what is shared with Extraversion. The fact that the dopaminergic systems originating in the mid- brain project to multiple brain regions may offer a clue to this dis- tinction. We previously suggested that, while Extraversion is likely to be associated with the set of dopaminergic projections to the stria- tum and limbic system (cf. Depue & Collins, 1999), Openness/Intel- lect may be associated with the set of dopaminergic projections to prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (DeYoung et al., 2002). The dorsolateral region of the PFC subserves a class of cognitive functions, often designated ‘‘working memory,’’ which are crucial for the conscious manipulation of information. These func- tions are necessary for dealing with novelty, generating plans, con- sidering possibilities, and analyzing and synthesizing abstract or complex relations (Mesulam, 2002; Miller, 2001)—activities consist- ent with a conceptualization of Openness/Intellect as a more cogni- tive or abstract exploratory tendency (as opposed to the more behavioral or concrete exploratory tendency associated with Extra- version). In their characterization of the cognitive component of Openness, McCrae, and Costa (1997) mention not only ‘‘permeabil- ity’’ but also ‘‘breadth’’ and ‘‘depth.’’ While permeability may stem from such low-level cognitive phenomena as decreased latent inhi- bition, the ability to generate the sort of cognitive complexity that could be described as ‘‘breadth’’ or ‘‘depth’’ seems likely to depend on the higher-level processes associated with dorsolateral PFC. The functions of the dorsolateral PFC are heavily influenced by dopamine. Dopaminergic projections to the PFC are strongest in the dorsolateral region (Arnsten and Robbins, 2002), and dopamine ap- pears to enhance dorsolateral PFC functions specifically, without 832 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"enhancing the functions of other PFC regions (Robbins, 2000). In- creased dopaminergic activation in the PFC is typically associated with increased cognitive flexibility and improved performance on various tests of cognitive ability and working memory (within limits: too much dopamine impairs performance; Arnsten and Robbins, 2002). Braver and colleagues have argued that one function of the dopaminergic projections to dorsolateral PFC is to allow new in- formation to enter working memory (Braver & Barch, 2002; Braver & Cohen, 2000). Ashby and colleagues (Ashby, Isen, & Turken, 1999; Ashby, Valentin, & Turken, 2002) have proposed that dopa- mine release in dorsolateral PFC (as well as in the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex) is responsible for the improvements in working memory and creative thinking that follow experimental manipulations inducing positive affect. Given that Extraversion is associated with a tendency to experience positive affect (Costa & McCrae, 1992b), Ashby and colleagues’ model seems consistent with the association of Openness/Intellect and Extraversion. In light of this review, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the dorsolateral PFC and its interaction with the dopaminergic system constitute unique sources of Openness/Intellect. As a first step toward testing this model, we performed a study examining the relation between Openness/Intellect and various meas- ures of cognitive function associated with dorsolateral PFC. We ad- ministered a battery of seven computerized tasks, all of which have been associated with dorsolateral PFC function through clinical stud- ies of brain-damaged patients, animal research, and neuroimaging of intact human brain function. In addition to these tasks specifically designed to assess prefrontal function, two measures of general cog- nitive ability ( g ) were administered, the WAIS-III (Wechsler, 1997) and Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), which is very highly g -loaded and resembles the matrices subtest of the WAIS-III (Raven, Raven, & Court, 1998). Not surprisingly, given that the do- main of Openness/Intellect includes descriptors like ‘‘smart’’ and ‘‘intelligent,’’ Openness/Intellect has been shown to be the only Big Five trait positively associated with IQ, a common index of g (McCrae, 1993; Moutafi, Furnham, & Crump, 2003). The association with IQ provides a further reason to expect Open- ness/Intellect to be associated with dorsolateral PFC function: Dun- can and colleagues (2000) demonstrated, using positron emission tomography, that tasks loading highly on g preferentially activate Sources of Openness/Intellect 833"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"dorsolateral PFC and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, relative to tasks with low g loadings. Similarly, Gray, Chabris, and Braver (2003) showed with fMRI that performance on Raven’s APM is correlated with lateral prefrontal activation during working memory tasks. Performance on Raven’s APM has also been shown to cor- relate with dopaminergic function (Volkow et al., 1998). Utilizing tests of g allowed us not only to replicate the association of Openness/Intellect with g , but also to separate fluid and crystal- lized g . Fluid g ( g F) refers to raw cognitive ability, the ability to solve novel problems, applicable independently of the content of a given task. Crystallized g ( g C) refers to acquired knowledge, applicable only when a task requires utilization of such knowledge, as in a vo- cabulary test, for example (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Jensen, 1998). Because it is possible for performance on individual tasks to involve both fluid and crystallized abilities, factor analysis is an ap- propriate method for deriving separate scores for g F and g C. As it seems likely that both raw ability and acquired knowledge will con- tribute to Openness/Intellect, we hypothesized that factor scores for g F and g C would be independent predictors of Openness/Intellect. Because Duncan (1995) has argued that g F, rather than g C, is as- sociated with the functions of dorsolateral PFC, an independent contribution of g C to Openness/Intellect would motivate us to spec- ify additional brain systems as potential sources of Openness/Intel- lect, namely those associated with language and declarative memory. Openness/Intellect has been shown to be more strongly associated with g C than g F (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Ashton et al., 2000), but whether g F and g C contribute independently to Openness/In- tellect has not previously been tested. Hypotheses To summarize, we expected Openness/Intellect (but not Extraver- sion) to be associated with four cognitive variables: firstly, prefrontal function, as assessed by our battery of prefrontal tasks; secondly, g , as assessed by the WAIS-III and Raven’s APM; and finally, g F and g C, as assessed by factor analysis of the various cognitive tests, in- cluding scores on the prefrontal battery. We assumed the latter would load primarily on g F, in keeping with Duncan’s (1995) argu- ment that g F relies strongly on dorsolateral PFC function. With all four of these variables, we were also interested in the question of 834 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"whether cognitive ability would predict variance in Openness/Intel- lect independently of Extraversion, which can stand as a proxy for the neuropsychological processes associated with both personality factors. Independent contributions to Openness/Intellect were tested using regression. Using the NEO PI-R (Costa and McCrae’s, 1992b), which parses each of the Big Five into six constituent traits, called facets , allowed us to examine the relation of Openness to the cognitive variables at the facet level as well. Based on our characterization of Openness/ Intellect as a cognitive exploratory tendency and Extraversion as a behavioral exploratory tendency, we hypothesized that the ‘‘Ac- tions’’ facet of Openness was likely to be more strongly related to Extraversion and less strongly related to Openness/Intellect than any other Openness facet. To put this another way, we imagined that someone who was relatively low in Extraversion but high in Open- ness/Intellect would be less open to novel behaviors, even though he or she should be open to ideas, values, aesthetics, etc. While many reported factor analyses have found that Actions loads more strong- ly on Openness than on Extraversion (e.g., Costa & McCrae, 1992b), they have usually been performed with varimax rotation, which maximizes the discrepancy between loadings on different factors. Correlations yield a less biased index of association, and we suspect they will reveal a greater strength of association between Actions and Extraversion than factor analysis will. If this proves to be the case, the Actions facet might be thought of as a function of the more general trait Plasticity. In anticipation of this result, we also hypoth- esized that the Actions facet would be less related to performance on the cognitive measures than the other facets of Openness. METHOD Participants Participants in this study were a subset of Sample 1 in DeYoung et al. (2002). Only this subset ( N 5 175; 56 male, 119 female) completed stand- ard measures of g and a computerized battery of cognitive tasks associ- ated with prefrontal cortical function. All were university students, ranging in age from 18 to 38 ( M 5 21.2, SD 5 2.9). In the larger sample from which this one was drawn, we have already demonstrated the ex- istence of the higher-order factors of the Big Five (DeYoung et al., 2002). Sources of Openness/Intellect 835"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Personality Measures Personality was assessed with two common Big Five instruments, the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992a, 1992b) and Goldberg’s (1992) Trait Descriptive Adjectives (TDA). The NEO PI-R consists of 240 potentially self-descriptive state- ments, to which participants responded using a 5-point Likert scale, and provides scores for 30 facet-level traits, 6 of which make up each of the Big Five. The TDA assesses the Big Five by means of 100 adjectives (20 for each factor) to which participants responded using a 7-point Likert scale. Additionally, composite scores for the Big Five were created by averaging standardized NEO PI-R and TDA scores for each factor. General Cognitive Ability General cognitive ability ( g ) was assessed by means of two measures. The first consisted of five subtests from the WAIS-III (Wechsler, 1997): Vo- cabulary, Similarities, Block Design, Arithmetic, and Digit-Symbol Cod- ing. Using the previous version of the WAIS (WAIS-R) Ward and Ryan (1996) found that this shortened version affords a time savings of ap- proximately 55% compared to the full WAIS, while maintaining a .97 correlation with full scale IQ and a reliability coefficient of .96. One par- ticipant did not complete the WAIS due to time constraints. The second measure of g was Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM; Raven et al., 1998), which is considered to assess mainly fluid intelligence ( Jen- sen, 1998). Raven’s APM consists of 36 increasingly difficult matrix rea- soning problems, similar to those in the matrix reasoning subtest of the WAIS-III, and participants are given 40 minutes to solve as many as possible. The first unrotated factor, from principal axis factor analysis of these measures, was used as an index of g . Prefrontal Measures Similar versions of the seven computerized cognitive tasks described below haveallbeenassociatedwiththeactivi ty of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex through imaging and lesion studies in humans and animals. While activation of additional brain areas has been reported for some of the measures (as described below), the dorsolate ral contribution is common to all. Self-ordered pointing . Participants were presented with 12 stimuli and instructed to click on each stimulus exactly once. After each selection, the spatial location of all stimuli changed. Four versions of the task were completed by each participant, each employing a different class of stimuli: abstract figures; pictures of easily named objects; words; nonwords (e.g., 836 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"‘‘xworl’’). In monkeys, performance on a similar version of the task ap- pears to be specific to middorsolateral PFC (areas 9 and 46), (Petrides, 1995, 2000). Human lesion studies have confirmed the PFC as crucial for performance on this task (Petrides & Milner, 1982; Wiegersma, van der Scheer, & Human, 1990), and positron emission tomography (PET) has identified activation of areas 9 and 46 during normal human performance of this task (Petrides, Alivisatos, Evans, & Meyer, 1993). Letter randomization . Participants were asked to randomize a four-let- ter span of the alphabet (e.g., ‘‘Randomize the letters from L to O’’). If participants produced an acceptable sequence, they were asked to ran- domize a span one letter longer. If an error was made (an omission or patterned sequence, e.g., ‘‘L, M, N’’), they were given another chance to randomize a span of the same length. The task terminated when partic- ipants failed two trials in a row or correctly randomized a span of 14 letters. Patients with frontal lobes lesions are impaired on this task (Wiegersma et al., 1990), and PET has revealed bilateral activation in areas 9 and 46 during normal performance (Petrides, Alivisatos, Meyer, & Evans, 1993). Spatial and nonspatial conditional association tasks . In both of these tasks, a set of associations between pairs of stimuli must be learned by trial and error. In the spatial task, five identical circles and five identical squares were presented together in random positions on the screen. Par- ticipants were instructed that each square was associated with exactly one circle. On each trial, a circle was highlighted and participants were re- quired to click the square they believed to be associated with that circle. Feedback was given until the correct response was made on each trial, but a trial was scored as correct only if the correct response was made on the first selection. The task was terminated after 10 consecutive correct trials, or after 100 trials. Two versions were completed, differing in the spatial arrangement of the shapes. In the non-spatial task, participants learned arbitrary associations between cue words and target words. Again, two versions were completed, one employing regular words and the other, nonwords. Monkeys with dorsolateral PFC lesions are impaired on both spatial (Petrides, 1987) and nonspatial (Petrides, 1985a) conditional as- sociation tasks. Human patients with unilateral surgical excisions (for treatment of epilepsy) of the left or right frontal lobes are similarly im- paired on both spatial and nonspatial versions (Petrides, 1985b, 1990). Levine, Stuss, and Milberg (1997) found deficits specifically for patients with dorsolateral PFC lesions on a non-spatial version. PET has revealed selective activation in area 8 of the left dorsolateral PFC while performing a non-spatial version of the task (Petrides, Alivisatos, Evans, et al., 1993). Sources of Openness/Intellect 837"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Go/No-go . Four letters flashed sequentially, repeatedly, and in random order, on the screen. Participants were required to click when two of the letters appeared (the ‘‘go’’ stimuli) and not to click when the other two (‘‘no-go’’) stimuli appeared. Contingencies were learned by trial and er- ror; when a correct response was made, the word ‘‘Good’’ appeared and a score counter increased by 1 (the score was displayed throughout the task). The task was terminated after 200 trials or after 20 consecutive correct trials. Monkeys with dorsal prefrontal lesions show impaired per- formance on a simplified version of this task (Petrides, 1987). Human brain imaging studies of go/no-go performance have employed versions of the task with only one ‘‘go’’ and one ‘‘no-go’’ stimulus (Casey et al., 1997; Liddle, Kiehl, & Smith, 2001), thereby minimizing working memory demand. Dorsolateral PFC involvement seems especially likely when the working memory component is increased by the addition of more stimuli. Even in the two-stimulus version, dorsolateral activation has been de- tected using fMRI, especially during no-go trials, although ventrolateral and anterior cingulate activation was also present (Casey et al., 1997; Liddle et al., 2001). A dopamine agonist (d-amphetamine) has been found to improve performance on a version of this task identical to ours except for the addition of two more ‘‘go’’ and two more ‘‘no-go’’ stimuli (de Witt, Enggasser, & Richards, 2002). Recency judgment . Participants were presented with a series of six or eight familiar nouns. Each word disappeared before the next appeared. Once the full series had been presented, the participant was shown two words from the sequence and asked to click on the word that appeared most recently. Eight trials used a six-word sequence and 14 used an eight- word sequence. Frontal lobe damage is associated with poor performance on recency judgment tasks (McDonald, Bauer, Grande, Gilmore, & Roper, 2001; Milner, Petrides, & Smith, 1985), and recency judgments have been associated with bilateral dorsolateral PFC activation in fMRI (Zorrilla, 1997). Word fluency . Participants were given 5 minutes to enter as many words as possible beginning with the letters ‘‘st,’’ using an on-screen, mouse- operated keyboard. They were instructed not to use inflected forms. Both Milner and Benton have demonstrated that patients with left prefrontal damage can show impaired word fluency without presenting with a typ- ical aphasia (reviewed in Damasio & Anderson, 1993). PET and fMRI imaging studies have demonstrated that word fluency tasks activate dorsolateral PFC areas 9 and 46 and also Broca’s area (Gaillard et al., 2000; Ravnkilde Jensen, Videbech, Gade, & Rosenberg, 2000). 838 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Scaled PFC scores . Norms for each task were established using a sample of 444 participants, allowing for the creation of scaled scores, which were used in all analyses (Higgins, Peterson, Pihl, & Lee, submitted). The scaled scores are standardized normal scores (Anastasi & Urbina, 1997), determined by calculating a percentile rank for each participant (based on raw scores) and computing the z -score equivalent (based on the inverse probability function) of this percentile rank. The mean correlation be- tween tasks in the normative sample was .27 and Cronbach’s alpha was .72. A composite PFC score was calculated by averaging scaled scores from the seven tasks. RESULTS Lexical and Questionnaire Measures of Openness/Intellect Table 1 shows the zero-order correlations among the Big Five as measured by the NEO PI-R and TDA. As expected, NEO PI-R Openness and TDA Intellect show the smallest correlation of any of the pairs of corresponding Big Five scales. (Neuroticism and its cor- responding TDA scale, Emotional Stability, are negatively correlat- ed because the TDA orients this scale toward the positive rather than the negative pole of the trait dimension.)

A CFI or GFI value above .90 (indicating that the model accounts for more than 90 percent of the observed covariance) is considered a good fit, as is a RMSEA less than 0.08 (Schumaker & Lomax, 1996), although Hu and Bentler (1999) have argued that RMSEA should be less than 0.06 to indicate close fit. A regression using composite Big Five scores was performed to test for independent contributions of Extraversion and PFC score to Openness/Intellect.

One subtest of the WAIS, Digit-Symbol Coding (DS), is significantly negatively correlated with Openness/Intellect. Among the cognitive variables, DS shows only three significant correlations out of a possible six, whereas each other cognitive variable is cor- related with all the others (Table 4). These discrepancies may indi- cate some lack of commonality with the other cognitive measures in the underlying processes that affect performance on DS. 4 Indeed, 4. In factor analysis of the normative sample for the WAIS-III, DS was found to have the lowest loading on g of the various subtests (Deary, 2001), which renders it less surprising that DS should vary more independently than the other subtests in our sample. The simplicity of the task may be responsible: DS requires a series of shapes to be copied from the top of the page, where each is paired with a digit, into a series of boxes labeled with the digit that corresponds to the shape to be entered, as fast as possible. Working memory demand is minimized by the pres- ence of the stimulus pairings at the top of the page.

All of the facets except Actions show an independent contribution of g C, while only Ideas and Values show an independent contribution of g F. DISCUSSION The finding of an association between Openness/Intellect and a bat- tery of tasks linked to dorsolateral PFC function supports the hy- pothesis that the cognitive functions of this brain region constitute an important source of Openness/Intellect, one not shared by Ex- traversion or any other of the Big Five. The association of general cognitive ability ( g ), and particularly fluid g ( g F), with Openness/ Intellect is also consistent with our model, given existing evidence that g F is associated with dorsolateral PFC (Duncan, 1995; Gray et al., 2003) and given our finding that PFC scores load primarily on the g F factor. The fact that fluid and crystallized cognitive ability independently predict variance in Openness/Intellect adds a further dimension to our understanding of the trait, and suggests the need to posit additional unique sources of Openness/Intellect in brain re- gions responsible for language and declarative memory.

Ver- bal ability and crystallized knowledge both rely on cortical neural systems beyond the dorsolateral PFC. In the PFC, for example, lan- guage functions are associated with Broca’s area, in the left hemi- sphere posterior to the dorsolateral regions associated with working memory (Deacon, 1997). For crystallized knowledge, the hippocam- pus and regions of the parietal and temporal cortices subserving de- clarative memory are likely to be important, though our focus on brain regions should not prevent us from noting that what has been learned by an individual is no doubt at least as important as where in the brain that knowledge has been stored. The fact that genetic fac- tors appear to account for only about 50% of variance in personality (Bouchard, 1994; Reimann et al., 1997) means that the environment certainly helps to shape Openness/Intellect. Environmental influenc- es are obviously crucial in shaping g C, and the influence of g Con Openness/Intellect, independently of g F, seems likely to reflect the contributions of education (though it may also reflect genetically determined differences in brain systems underlying crystallized or verbal ability). The importance of the environment in shaping both g C and personality may, in part, explain why g C is related to Open- ness/Intellect more strongly than g F is. Measurement: Openness Versus Intellect Our results support the position that NEO PI-R Openness and TDA Intellect are slightly different operationalizations of the same under- lying construct. Despite its label, the Intellect scale incorporates de- scriptors that seem equally consistent with the label ‘‘Openness,’’ such as ‘‘imaginative’’ and ‘‘artistic.’’ Its correlations with the facets of NEO PI-R Openness (Table 3) are consistent with the idea that its operationalization, while not as broad as that of the NEO PI-R, still taps a variety of the facets that fall within the domain of Openness/ Intellect. The strongest correlation is with the Ideas facet, but cor- relations with Fantasy, Aesthetics, and Feelings are all above .40—in the same range as the correlations between these facets and total NEO PI-R Openness (Table 6). Inasmuch as NEO PI-R Openness was generally more strongly related to the cognitive variables than was TDA Intellect, there is no evidence that Openness scores should 848 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"be any less indicative of traits like intellect or intelligence than In- tellect scores. More important than small differences in effect sizes, furthermore, is the overall similarity in the patterns of associations with the cognitive variables. A composite of the two scales is prob- ably equal to or better than either scale alone as an index of the total domain of Openness/Intellect. Facets of Openness/Intellect The ability to examine facet-level traits is certainly an advantage of the NEO PI-R, and some interesting differences in the patterns of association with cognitive variables emerged at the facet level. Fluid g and PFC scores were more strongly associated with two facets, Ideas and Values, than with the other four facets, and these were the only two facets to which g F contributed independently of g C. These findings suggest that dorsolateral PFC functions may contribute more to some aspects of Openness/Intellect than others (though it is important to remember that structural equation modeling showed that PFC score was related to the shared variance of all the facets). While it is not surprising that the Ideas facet, which is most clearly related conceptually to intellect and intelligence, is more heavily as- sociated with g F, one might wonder why Values should be linked to raw intelligence and the ability to solve novel problems. The Values facet includes items emphasizing moral relativism (e.g., ‘‘I believe that the different ideas of right and wrong that people in other so- cieties have may be valid for them’’; ‘‘I consider myself broad-mind- ed and tolerant of other people’s lifestyles’’) and freedom from conventional dogmatism (e.g., ‘‘I believe we should look to our re- ligious authorities for decisions on moral issues’’—reverse scored). Unconventionality has typically been located within the domain of Openness/Intellect in the lexical tradition as well (Saucier & Goldb- erg, 2001). But why should these attributes be associated with g F and PFC function? Perhaps because they require the cognitive flexibility to imagine different ways of living and to take the perspective of others. Coping with previously unfamiliar perspectives is likely to be aided by the novelty processing and abstract thinking that is con- trolled by dorsolateral PFC (Mesulam, 2002). We will refrain from detailing the implications of this finding for contemporary politics. While g F is independently associated with only two facets of Openness, g C is independently associated with all facets except Ac- Sources of Openness/Intellect 849"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"tions. Fantasy, Aesthetics, and Feelings, therefore, may rely less heavily on dorsolateral PFC than on processes involved in language and memory. These three facets may also be more subject to mod- ification by environmental factors during development. Perhaps fu- ture research will identify different developmental trajectories leading to facets of Openness associated primarily with g C as op- posed to those associated with both g F and g C. The fact that g C appears to be associated with more facets of the Openness/Intellect domain may constitute another reason that total Openness/Intellect scores tend to be more strongly related to g C than to g F (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Ashton et al., 2000). Our results pertain mainly to sources of variance unique to Open- ness/Intellect, rather than shared with Extraversion. Our model specifies both, however, and the results of our facet-level analysis also bear on what Openness/Intellect and Extraversion share. The central dopaminergic system regulates positive motivational re- sponses toward novelty, driving exploration (Panksepp, 1998), and we have argued that this motivation is a feature shared by Extra- version and Openness/Intellect. The hypothesis that Extraversion primarily reflects the expression of this exploratory motivation in behavior while Openness/Intellect primarily reflects its expression in cognition is supported by our finding that the Actions facet is as strongly related to Extraversion as it is to Openness/Intellect. Fur- ther, Actions is less strongly related to Openness/Intellect and cog- nitive abilities than are the other five Openness facets. Someone who is open without being extraverted seems more likely to explore the world cognitively than behaviorally and would therefore be less like- ly to score high on the Actions facet. Openness to Actions appears, in our sample at least, to stem roughly equally from Openness/In- tellect and Extraversion, suggesting it might best be conceived as a function of the higher-order trait Plasticity, or at least as a relatively peripheral facet of Openness/Intellect. Attempts to replicate this finding should employ correlation and regression, rather than factor analysis with varimax rotation, to avoid artificial suppression of as- sociations of facets with multiple Big Five domains. Sources of Openness/Intellect In keeping with the results described above, Openness/Intellect can be characterized broadly as motivated cognitive flexibility, or cog- 850 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"nitive exploration, emerging from multiple levels of brain function, all potentially modulated by dopamine. At the level of motivation, dopamine appears to assign positive value to novelty (Panksepp, 1998). At a preconscious level, dopaminergic activity decreases latent inhibition, rendering categories more flexible and allowing more of the complexity of the environment to become salient (Peterson et al., 2002). Finally, at a higher cognitive level, dopamine facilitates the flexible information processing accomplished by the dorsolateral PFC (Arnsten & Robbins, 2002). Dopamine may even affect the systems responsible for verbal or crystallized abilities, as memory retrieval can be facilitated by dopamine (Arnsten & Robbins, 2002). At all three of these levels, Openness/Intellect may be attributable to the functions of specific brain systems independently of their modulation by dopamine. In its operation as a neuromodulator, dopamine is not typically necessary for the functions of its target neural systems, but rather increases their activation (Depue & Coll- ins, 1999). Our model therefore specifies that individual differences in Openness/Intellect may stem, in an additive manner, from three different types of individual difference in brain function: (1) differ- ences in the functioning of regions like the dorsolateral PFC, inde- pendent of modulation by dopamine, (2) differences in the innervation of these regions by dopaminergic neurons, and (3) dif- ferences in the sensitivity and activity of the dopaminergic system itself. This is an important caveat because the present results offer no direct evidence of dopamine’s involvement in Openness/Intellect. Given what is known about the role of dopamine in dorsolateral PFC function, however, our results do fit coherently into the larger picture sketched out in our model. Further, the finding of an asso- ciation between Openness/Intellect and dorsolateral PFC function is of interest in its own right, regardless of the link to dopamine. That there appear to be multiple brain systems involved in Open- ness/Intellect implies that scores on the trait will not necessarily re- flect all of these sources equally or in the same proportion across individuals, which may explain why the relations between perform- ance on cognitive tasks and Openness/Intellect are not stronger. A high scorer on Openness/Intellect, for example, might be interested in novelty and very low in latent inhibition while possessing merely average cognitive abilities associated with dorsolateral PFC. Not only that, but questionnaire measures of Openness/Intellect are largely concerned with typical behavior and experience, which one Sources of Openness/Intellect 851"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"would expect to be only partly a function of the sort of maximal ability assessed by the cognitive tests (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997). Nonetheless, we note, in accordance with Hemphill’s (2003) recent meta-analysis, that effect sizes in the range of .20 to .30 con- stitute the middle third of effect sizes reported in psychology, when predictor and criterion variables do not share method. An effect size of .33, as found in our structural equation model of the association between latent Openness/Intellect and dorsolateral PFC variables, falls within the upper third of reported effect sizes. Using observer ratings of personality in addition to self-reports would be likely to increase effect sizes even further. Finally, bearing in mind the degree to which the Big Five are likely to be multiply determined, we emphasize that the neuropsycholog- ical model presented here is not assumed to be exhaustive. Other brain regions helping to generate cognitive flexibility, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), may well constitute impor- tant additional sources of Openness/Intellect. The dopaminergic projections from the VTA to the frontal lobes innervate dACC as well as PFC, and, as mentioned above, the dACC is sometimes found active during tasks that also activate the dorsolateral PFC (e.g., Duncan et al., 2000; Liddle et al., 2001). The dACC has been identified as an error, anomaly, or novelty detector (Clark, Fannon, Lai, Benson, & Bauer, 2000; Holroyd & Coles, 2002). Of the neuro- modulators other than dopamine, acetylcholine seems likely to be implicated in Openness/Intellect. The cholinergic system responds to novel stimuli, widely activates the cortex via the thalamus, and di- rectly excites dopaminergic neurons (Mesulam, 1995). Recent work with genetic knockout mice has linked the cholinergic receptor M5, which is responsible for acetylcholine’s direct effects on the do- paminergic system, with the modulation of latent inhibition (Yeo- mans, Forster, & Blaha, 2001; Wang et al., 2004). The evidence we have provided for our model of Openness/Intel- lect is far from complete. However, we feel that enough evidence exists to sketch out a coherent and compelling neuropsychological model. Hopefully, our proposal will spur further research into the sources of Openness/Intellect. Pharmacological manipulations will be necessary for direct tests of the role of the dopaminergic system, and neuroimaging may offer a more definitive test of the role of dorsolateral PFC. Given the rate at which the complexities of brain function are being illuminated by neuroscience, we expect soon to see 852 DeYoung, Peterson, Higgins"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"not only neuropsychological models describing the sources of each of the Big Five, but also integrated, comprehensive models that will describe relations and interactions among personality factors.
