The first is an American ritual dated circa 1827 and is here published for the first time. The second is a translation of an 1860 French ritual. Both rituals are in manuscrirul form and presently owned by a private collector who wishes to remain anonymous. It is noted emphatically that neither of these rituals is used by either legitimate Supreme Council 330 in the United States, nor by the Supreme Council 33 “for England and Wales. Whether remnants of these workings find inclusion in the rituals of other Supreme Councils we cannot say. America, circa 1827 The c.1827 ceremonial is written in a fine hand on a single sheet of paper measuring 8x13 inches which has several small water stains though the text is unaffected. Some words are hyphenated at the end of a line, though not at the syllables. These marks, as well as the original spelling and punctuation, have been retained. The inclusion of a small portion of another degree (320 ?) on the top of the page suggests that the ceremony was the last item in a set of rituals. On the back of the sheet appear two brief notes which are also reproduced. 1 The ritual, if it can indeed be called that, appears so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether it represents a synopsis or a complete working. Fortunately the note on the back refering to M[oses] Holbrook suggests the “regularity’’ of the ceremony since he was Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council 330, 5•~ M:.J:., from 1826~1844.2 The note also mentions October 31, 1827, the date the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions agreed upon territorial bounderies. 1 The French message is along the following line — “The secrecy of the mysteries being an indispensible obligation, the Thrice Puissant Grand Master shall, before closing Lodge, recommend that to the Brethren in the usual manner and form.” 2 In the note “S.C.” may be either “Sovereign Commander” or “South Carolina.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"France,1860 The second ritual is an unsigned translation of a French version credited to Jean-Baptiste Marie Ragon 3 and presumably from his Tuileur G~n~ral de la Franc-Maqonnerie, ou Manuel de l’Initi~ (Paris: Collignon, 1861).~ Ragon does not claim authorship of the ritual and makes several critical remarks concerning its apparent historical inaccuracies. A note indicates its date of composition as 1860. This ritual was widely used during the mid-to-late 1800’s and was translated into Spanish by Andres Cassard for his Manual de la Masoneria (Barcelona: Bauza, 1860) and also finds inclusion—though in abbreviated form — in the irregular Cemeau rituals of the “Sovereign and Independent State of New York” exposed in Jonathan Blanchard, Scotch Rite Masonry Illustrated [2 vols.] (Chicago: Ezra A. Cook, 1887-1888). The manuscript book which includes this translation is signed “C.R.S.” on the inside cover and appears to have been written either hurriedly or carelessly, as the penmanship is occasionally poor, though always legible. The lined leather- bound book measures approximately 7x8 inches and the ritual’s text occupies the last ninety-six pages. The 330 ritual is written upside-down beginning on the last page. The first thirty-three pages are filled with the secret work of several Masonic degrees, beginning with the Chapter and Council, which is followed by the “Red t” and finally the 15”-32” of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite (under the date “Septr 2, 1856”). Towards the middle of the book are 29 pages used for seemingly non- Masonic matters though one page includes notes made while visiting a fellow Mason either in or from Chicago on December 22, 1862. The rituals are especially interesting to those studying the “vengeance,~~ kadosh and templar aspects of Freemasonry and provide insights into the developing themes of Masonic symbolism. The transcriptions commence on the following page. ~J.M. Ragon (c.1781-c.1866) was denominated “the most learned Freemason of the nineteenth century.” Originally a native of Belgium, he was initiated in 1803 at Bruges, and later moved to Pans, France where he founded the Lodge of the Les Trinosophes. ‘~ This ritual is also described in some detail by Arthur Edward Waite, “Sovereign Grand Inspector General” in A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry [rev. ed.] 2 vols.

Skeletons, skulls, cross-bones and hands are painted above. Above the presiding officer is a transparency up6n which is depicted a triangle with the “yod” at the center. In the center of the room is a triangular pedestal, covered with a crimson cloth upon which is an open Bible and a naked sword across it. In the North is a human skeleton, standing upright, holding in the left hand the white banner of the Order and in its right, a dagger ready to strike. Above the inside entrance door is a blue banner upon which is inscribed the motto: “Deus Meumque Jus” (God and my right). In the East is a five-branched candlestick; in the West one of three branches, in the North one of one., and in the South one of two; in all eleven lights. Titles: The assembly is known as the “Supreme Council.” The Grand Master assumes the title “Very Puissant Sovereign Grand Commander,” representing Frederick the Second, King of Prussia. There is one styled “Sovereign Lieutenant Commander.” There is also a “Treasurer of the Holy Empire,” a “Grand Chancellor,” an “Illustrious Grand Secretary of the Holy Empire,” an “Illustrious Master of Ceremonies,” and an “Illustrious Captain of the Guard,” but he is not considered a member of the Supreme Council. The ordinary members are called “Illustrious Sovereigns Grand Inspectors General.” Token—None. Age—Accomplished Thirty. Battery—Eleven raps (5-3-1-2). (Note: This battery, in thousands, signifies 5312. It is well-known that the year 1312 was that of the suppression of the Order of the Temple, recalled by this number, the eleven raps of which are the number of lights which illuminate the hall.) 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Apron—None. Regalia: The Very Puissant Sovereign Grand Commander is dressed in a robe of crimson bordered with white: he wears a royal crown on his head and has a sword in his right hand.

He is seated in the West on a throne of three steps. The Captain of the Guard wears old military clothing. All members wear a large white watered cordon, bordered with gold piping. At the bottom of the cordon is a rosette, white, read and green, fringed with gold. On the front is a gold-embroidered delta, surrounded by a halo, on both sides of the delta is a dagger, the points aimed at the center of the delta. In the center of the delta is the number 33, written in Arabic numerals. This cordon is worn from left to right. Further, under civilian dress is worn on the left breast a red Teutonic cross. Jewel: The jewel is a black double-headed eagle, crowned, with wings outspread and clutching a sword in its claws; the beaks, nails and sword are gold.

Answer—Accomplished thirty, Very Puisant Sovereign. Question—What is your duty? Answer—To battle for God and my right, and inflict vengeance upon traitors. Question—What is the hour? 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Answer—The watchword has been given, the guards are at their stations, and we are in perfect security. The Sovereign then says: Since we need not fear interruption, give notice by the mystic numbers that the Supreme Council of the 33d degree is about to be opened “Ad Gloriam Dei” [to the Glory of God. —Editor], that we can safely labor in our undertakings and implore the presence of the God of Battles to assist us in our combats, and finally obtain justice and our rights. (He then raps with the hilt of his sword 5,3,1,2 which is repeated by the Sovereign Lieutenant Commander and the Supreme Council is open.) All members kneel, likewise the Sovereign Grand Commander and humbly offer to God this prayer, preceded by the words: Let us pray! “0 Thou great and Eternal God, Father of Light, Life and Supreme Architect of the World, whom from Thy throne of heavenly purity seest all peoples of the earth, hear and receive, the prayers and supplications of Thy unworthy servants now prostrate before Thee. Engrave in our hearts the knowledge of the Eternal Word, and allow the purposes of our institution to be governed by the principles of virtue and justice. Defend us, 0 God, from the traps of the wicked! Protect us against the machinations of our enemies and give us the power to conquer those who are arrayed against us; for honor and glory are ascribed to Thy holy and mighty name, now and forever. Amen! Amen! Amen!” RECEPTION. As this degree is the most solemn and the most important it is necessary to take the utmost precautions in the selection of persons to be admitted therein. It is not enough to arrive at this degree to have been admitted of the degree of Royal Secret; to this requirement must be added a character and behavior beyond reproach in addition to a steadfast and unwavering zeal, virtue and well-tested determination of soul. The aspirant submits to the Supreme Council his petition in the following form: PETITION. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Being ardently devoted to the glorious enterprise of the Knight Kadosh and Prince of the Royal Secret, and earnestly desiring to arrive at the summit of Masonic knowledge which you alone can provide, I very humbly beg permission to offer myself as a candidate for admission into your Illustrious and Puissant Council, and your votes in my favor will be the cause of unceasing gratitude on my part. Signed, The candidate is then proposed and accepted by acclamation. (He can be excluded forever is the reasons advanced are deemed good and sufficient.) The Illustrious Master of Ceremonies then takes the Aspirant and examines him in all the preceding degrees, since one cannot be admitted into the Supreme Council unless one has been regularly initiated into the ancient mysteries and received all the degrees from Entered Apprentice to the 32d degree, being Prince of the Royal Secret, for which fact a certificate must be submitted. He must declare that the Holy Bible is the sacred eternal word of God, because one who assumes an oath upon a book he does not recognize cannot assume a valid obligation. (Note: This statement, unacceptable to three-quarters of the world’s inhabitants, would tend, if taken literally, to make the 33d degree an intolerant group which would have no relation to the cosmopolitan institution of Masonry, and is yet a task for this part, invented in 1805, to see this strange requirement play part in the ritual. —Jean-Baptiste Ragon) No one can be admitted to this degree until he has completed his 30th year. The candidate having complied with these formal requirements is conducted to door of the Supreme Council where he knocks 5,3,1,2 raps. The Lieutenant Grand Commander says: Very Puissant Grand Commander, someone knocks at the door an disturbs the deliberations of the Supreme Council. Answer—Go and see who knocks. The officer goes to the door, knocks 5,3,1,2 raps and says: Who disturbs our deliberations? The Master of Ceremonies answers: A Knight Kadosh, Prince of the Royal Secret who is ardently devoted to the Order, his country and his God, who beholds the sufferings of humanity in the death of his Master with an avenging eye and who humbly solicits the favor of admittance into the Supreme Council, that being enlightened by Divine Wisdom he may spread the mantle of Masonic charity over those who are in darkness. S"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Grand Commander closes the door and relays the response to the Sovereign grand Commander, who gives the sign that he may be admitted if he possesses the necessary qualifications. The Illustrious Master of Ceremonies introduces the aspirant, who is dressed in black, and without hat, shoes, sword or apron, and who has his head bowed, arms crossed over his breast with the fingers extended and a ribbon about his neck which is held in the left hand of the Master of Ceremonies and a torch in his right. In this condition he thrice circumambulates the Supreme Council and upon passing the Sovereign Grand Commander he bows in humble veneration before the sacred delta in the East. The Sovereign Grand Commander says: Let us humbly worship with the most profound reverence and piety the Source, that Glorious Spirit which is the Most Merciful and Beneficent Ruler of the Universe and all creatures it contains. Glory to His Holy Name, now and forever. This prayer is given after the first round. At the second the Sovereign Grand Commander says: How wonderful and impressive are the rays of that Glorious Light which illuminate from on high the Eastern sky, we adore the Great and Almighty Jehovah who is from all Eternity. Glory be to this Great and Powerful Name forever. After the third and last round the Sovereign Grand Commander says: Honorable Knight and Prince A.B., impressed with the ceremony in which you are to be the principal actor as you take an obligation which among all others is the most serious and important to which a man can subscribe and feeling conscious of the the terrible penalties which the Eternal inflicts upon all who violate the obligation you are about to assume, and as temptation frequently arise which may test your resignation and determination, it is necessary that we have some proof of your courage and fortitude. It is necessary, respectable Brother, for you to approach this urn and wash your hands in the molten lead you see therein; that the stains of vice and immorality with which your hands have been soiled will be purged from the heavenly record. We have all passed through the same trial and have escaped the threatening danger. Place your trust in God and resolutely determine to fulfill your obligation. The lead, though molten, will loose its heat when you insert your hand into it, and will recede from your touch. My Brethren, attend the mystic ceremony. (All advance to see it performed.) The urn should be an iron basin under which is a chafing dish containing piece of charcoal which must not be lighted until the moment the 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"candidate enters the Supreme Council, and placed on the bottom in a manner that he passes behind it as he turns. On it is thrown incense composed of amber, olibanum and resin, three parts of each, and two parts of storax, one part each of labdamon and benzoin mixed in a gross powder which yields an agreeable perfumed smoke. The urn should be half filled with quicksilver which has the appearance of lead but is not necessarily heated. (Note: This trial, though more ancient than the degree, is not worthy of the Brethren who permit it, or of the valiant Brother who willingly submits since he has been truthfully informed on receiving the degree of Royal Secret that he has received the completion of Masonic Temp larism. —Jean-Baptiste Ragon.) After dipping his hand in it, the candidate is conducted to the altar, before which he kneels and assumes his obligation which the incense burns. All the members also kneel and bow their heads in humble adoration and all have their right hands over their hearts. The candidate, with his right hand over his heart, repeats the following obligation: I, , Knight Kadosh, and Prince of the Royal Secret, solemnly pledge my sacred word of honor, swear sincerely and promise on the Holy Word of the Eternal, who is very merciful, sovereign, powerful and the Supreme Architect of Heaven and Earth, in the presence of whom, as well as the Supreme Council of the 33d Degree here assembled, that I will never directly or indirectly reveal the secrets and mysteries of the sublime degree which I am about to receive, nor any of those which I have received, except to an equal Sovereign Grand Inspector General who has likewise lawfully received it. I furthermore swear to strictly and scrupulously follow the statutes, constitutions and regulations of this Degree and to fulfill the duties of Grand Inspector General diligently, faithfully and without partiality, favoritism or prejudice and that I will never receive nor recognize any higher degree in Masonry than this; that I will worship the Only True and Living God in the manner and form that I believe according to my conscience will please Him the most, and that I will govern my conduct according to His Divine commands; that I will yield allegiance and fealty to the country in which I reside and will be obedient to all the orders and laws of the government; that I will to the utmost of my ability inculcate by word and deed our duty to God and neighbor; as I am 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"convinced that virtue alone makes us worthy of respect and religion makes us happy. I swear and promise all this without equivocation, or mental reservation and with no hope of being freed at some future period thereof by any power whatsoever, under the self-imposed penalty of being dishonored among men and having my name branded in red letters in the Councils and Lodges World-wide, and I here solemnly call upon the Great Eternal God to pour out his c.urses upon this head (here the candidate places his right hand upon his head) and to let me languish in misery and misfortune and finally to subject my soul to tortures till it perish, should I ever violate my present obligation. May Almighty God grant me sufficient power to abide it in every particular to the great glory of His Holy Name. Amen! Amen! Amen! (He kisses the Bible three times and the blade of the sword.) (Note: If a Jew takes this this obligation he should remain upright wearing his tephelin, the costume of the religious ceremonies of the synagogue, and a Hebrew Bible on his breast with his arms crossed upon it.) After the obligation the Grand Commander places a sword in his right hand saying: Honorable Knight and Brother, we place in your hand a deadly weapon which we instruct you never to use against the life of a Brother except in the following circumstances: 1. for your own defense, 2. against the common enemy of your country, 3. against blood stained criminals, the murderers of our Honorable Master, Jacques de Molay. He places on the fourth finger of his left hand a golden ring one line wide, within which is engraved “Deus Meumque Jus” and the name of the candidate; he then tells him: With this ring I thee wed to the Order, your Country and your God, and receive and acknowledge you a Sovereign Grand Inspector general of the Thirty-Third and Last Degree. May it ever recall to you the solemn obligations you have assumed to the Order. Swear to me never to fail to wear it except, but when you are near your death give it to your wife, son or eldest daughter, or dearest friend, as a sacred keepsake under a solemn promise not to remove it except in similar circumstances. The candidate responds: I swear it on my honor.

HISTORICAL DISCOURSE or LECTURE The Very Sovereign Grand Commander in Chief, Sovereign of Sovereigns, Prince of the Royal Secret was our Illustrious Brother Frederick II, King of Prussia. He established this degree in council with the Very Illustrious Brother, His Royal Highness, Louis of Bourbon, Prince of the French blood and other illustrious characters who had the degree of Knight Kadosh and Prince of the Royal Secret. The Degree of Knight Kadosh is the most awesome and important. In this degree you solemnly bound yourselves without restriction to destroy an order of men for crimes committed several centuries ago, without regard for the common principles of humanity and the laws of your country. In spite of the great precautions taken in selecting candidates some unworthy persons may have been received and others, by mistaken zeal or religious enthusiasm may have committed acts which were unallowable. In consequence, the King created and 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"established on May 4, 5786 the 33d degree to settle the remaining obligations of the Kadosh. The King was aware that according to the course of human events he could not expect to live many years longer and conceived and executed the glorious design of delegating Masonic authority of the Order of Prince of the Royal Secret in a Council of Grand Inspectors general, in order that he might be able, after his death to regulate agreeable to the Constitutions and Statutes which he established, the government of Masonry in all degrees from~the 17th or Knight of the East and West inclusive, allowing the supervision of Symbolic Lodges and the Grand Ineffable and Sublime Lodges of Perfection or Knight of the East or Sword, to the Grand Council of Princes of Jerusalem which he deemed justly charged with that power. The new Degree was denominated “Sovereign Grand Inspector General of the Supreme Council of the 33d Degree.” The Princes of the Royal Secret were deputies of the Grand Inspectors General. They act by virtue of the special powers granted them for that purpose but their power is granted to this degree. The Council, when formed, may consider all circumstances involving Masonry from the 17th degree ~on up and hear all appeals from Councils or persons above the Grand Council of the Princes of Jerusalem as explained in the Constitutions accompanying this degree. No Inspector possesses individual authority in a country where a Grand Council of Inspectors General exists, as a majority vote of the members is required to give legality to a decision the Grand Inspector may assume. In consequence of the powers with which the Inspectors of the degree are invested it is necessary to limit their number. Therefore a Council a Council consists of not more than nine members, five of whom must profess the Christian religion. No business can be transacted unless there are three brethren present, excepting the the establishment of a Council as provided by the Constitutions. There can be but one Council of this degree in each kingdom or nation of Europe and two in the United States of America as far apart from each other as possible, on in the English Islands in America and one in the French Islands. No Inspector may possess the manuscript ritual of this degree except those who first form the Council. When an Inspector goes to another country to establish the degree the manuscript is given to him with the obligation never to it except to the one chosen to act as his second in the establishment. The signs and words are given to all Inspectors. Vengeance for the unjust cruelties, insults and injuries inflicted upon the Knights Templar without provocation and in which the Knights of the Holy St. John of Jerusalem and of Malta assisted resulted in the formation of the degree of Kadosh in a manner clearly evident in this degree. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"According to the tale of the Knights of Malta by Abbe Vertot, the Knights Templar organized an order of Masonic Knighthood instituted under Pope Gelasimus II about the year of Masonry 5117; they were thus called because they lived on part of the Temple at Jerusalem, not far from the sepulcher of Jesus Christ. They received and gave charitable assistance to strangers and Christian pilgrims. Clothed in armor they escorted they into the Holy Land to see the Sacred Monuments of Christianity without fear of infidels. (Note; The Templar historian is here inaccurate, like all connected with this system. Pope Gelasimus II did not succeed Pascal II until 1118, he didn’t have time or authority to create a “Masonic Knighthood.” Twice banished from Rome by the consul Franzpair he agreed with King Henry V and had Maurice Bourdin elected in his place, under the name of Gregory VIII, Edasimus died in battle in the Abbey of Clary on January 29, 1119. We add that in this period there was no such thing as a “Masonic year.” —Jean-Baptiste Ragon.) This Order increased in numbers, power and wealth and about the year 1200 spread over the whole of Europe. Most of their Commanderies were situated along the Mediterranean and their influence and possessions seemed to increase daily. Philippe the Fair, King of France, grew jealous of them, which jealousy turned to hatred because they embraced the cause of Boniface VIII in disputes he had with the King. Philippe never forgave the Templars for their conduct in these matters. On the 13th of October 1309 he arrested all the Knights Templars in his Kingdom and inflicted upon them the most cruel tortures. In 1312 the Order was suppressed by Pope Clement V at the demand of the king of France. The Kings of England, Castile, Aragon and Sicily, the Counts of Provence and all Sovereigns of Europe had the Knights arrested and seized their possessions and placed guards in their commanderies. On October 1, 1312 the Council of Vienna banished the Order in agreement with the Pope and gave the greater part of their possessions to the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, Knights of Rhodes, now called “Knights of Malta” which were-established about 1120, when Honoris was Pope. The Knight Kadosh were called “Knights Templar” but after the massacre by Philippe the few who escaped changed their name and appearance, to avoid persecution of from their enemies until their numbers increased and they could take arms for for their just and lawful rights. They ceased wearing the black cordon and red cross, and substituted a large blood-colored cordon, 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"worn over the left shoulder to the right hip, to which was attached a black double-headed eagle with spread wings and holding a naked sword in its talons. About the Masonic year 5767 investigations were made in Paris to prove that Masons with the title Knights Kadosh were Templars. If the discovery succeeded the Order would have been destroyed. In consequence it was determined in Grand Council by communication with Berlin and Paris that in the future they should assume the title “Knights of the Black and White Eagle.” In order that the Knights of Malta could keep the possessions they illegally obtained they were obliged to exterminate the Order of the Temple, whose knights are actually those who received the degree of Knights Kadosh, or White and Black Eagle. The Knights Kadosh pledged each other, and in the name and presence of the Great and Eternal God to preserve the hatred and enmity towards the Knights of Malta and destroy them when in their power. Although we has assumed the duty to exterminate that Order which seeks our destruction, it is yet necessary that the extent of our enmity toward the order be well defined; this obligation does not require one of us, if on going to the Mediterranean on business should meet by accident a member of this Order we would be bound to cut his throat; that would be murder condemned by the laws of every country, punished by death. But if a sovereign power declared war, we are bound by the solemn obligation we has taken, and if our business permits, we are bound to join the army of their enemies and use our talents, both in cabinet and field to exterminate the Order, that we may again possess the rich and strong places belonging to Templars by right. As the different Masonic bodies are obliged to obey their superiors when they are sufficiently numerous and powerful they will be led against the enemy by the Sovereigns of the 33d Degree, and if victorious, the Knights Kadosh will declare themselves and take possession of the country of which they are illegally deprived and remain under the banner and protection of this rank from which they will receive systems of government founded on their rights and of the Knights and their zeal. Their service and virtuous sufferings during so many centuries. When we shall enter the field of our foes our forces will be directed according to the orders given in the degree of Prince of the Royal Secret, but as the Very Illustrious Sovereign of Sovereigns determined to invest this degree with supreme executive power, the command of the troops after his death devolved upon us. Therefore His Majesty King Frederick ordered that the first and second Commanders should order the troops, districts, nations and kingdoms over which they have Masonic jurisdiction. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"On the arrival of the land forces at Jerusalem where appointed, a Supreme Council of all who have received the 33d Degree shall convene immediately, where each Inspector General shall produce election papers to the degree and the holder of the oldest title shall be declared and proclaimed to the armies as generalissimo and take the title of Very Puissant Grand Commander. All other military ranks shall be given in succession according to the various dates of their certificates of election. Titles of the same date shall be settled by ballot. In the future, all ranks, honors, dignities, titles and possessions, etc., shall be hereditary. The government of the Order shall remain in the family of the Sovereign Grand Commander. On the suppression of the Knights of Malta the Sovereign Grand Commander will immediately convene a Supreme Council of the 33d Degree in which there shall be founded a constitution and system of government of the Order which shall always be a military one. The Order will then take its true title. The uniform of the Order, in the field, is blue, lapels and hems of white, white buttons on which is the jewel of the 33d Degree, on the small buttons only the number 33.
