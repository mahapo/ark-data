Companions, the Couneil here assembled repre - sents the Grand Council eouvened at Jerusalem in the second year of the reign of Darius, King of Persia, to deliberate upon the unhappy eouditiou of the coun - try, and to devise means whereby they might secure the favor and proteetion of the new Sovereign, and obtain his consent to their proceeding with the re - building of the City and Temple. After the death of Cyrus, the Jews, whom he lib - erated and sent back to Jerusalem, were forbidden by Cambyses, his son and successor, to continue the work of rebuilding, and at the time this Council was eon - vened the work had ceased during several ycars. Z., the royal Prince of the House of •Tndah, par - ticipated in the deliberations of that Council, and we have admitted you to this presence in expectation that you will assume the name and represent the character of that illustrious Prince, whose hands laid the foundation of the Second Temple, and whose hands the Lord promised should finish it.

P.: [Reads] Now in the second year of their com - ing unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshna the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together to set forward the workmen in the house of God; the sons of Henedad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Loan, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.— Ezra III: 8-11. Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel; Then they came to Zeriibbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacri - fice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath com - manded us. Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusa - tion against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue. 14 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:.... This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time. Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellions and the bad city, and have set up the wall thereof, and joined the foundations. Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. Now because we have main - tenance from the king’s palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king; That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. We certify the king, that if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their compan - ions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time. The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that re - bellion and sedition have been made therein. There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them. Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me. Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings’? Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their compan - ions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Peinusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.—Ezra iv, omitting verses 9 and 10. 15 ‘A’ ["},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"N, 1 H.

I will 17 cheerfully undertake the hazardous cute rprise of tra - 18 versing the Persian dominions and seeking admis - 19 sion to the presence of the King.

The tears and com - plaints of my companions at Jerusalem have brought me hither. My people were liberated by King Cyrus, and commanded to “build the house of the Lord God of Israel, which is in Jerusalem.” But, by command of King Cambyses, the work ceased, and our adyorsa - ries on the other side of the river have even since 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ii 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 hindered and impeded our noble and glorious efforts to rebuild the City and Temple of our God. Therefore have Ii come hither to implore your Ma - jesty ‘s favor and protection.

Prince Z, that is an important addition 24 you have made to our question, and it shall have con- 25 sideration. 26 Princes and Rulers, let the discussion now begin. 27 P. C., are you prepared to maintain your opinion by 28 argument ‘I If so, begin. 29 P. C.: [Arises and bows.] 0 ye Princes and 30 Rulers, how exceedingly strong iS WINE! It causeth 31 all men to err that drink it; it maketh the mind of the 32 king and the beggar to be all one; oL the boudman 33 and the freeman; of the poor man and of the rich; it 34 tuinneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so 22 1 that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt; it 2 changeth and elevateth the spirits, and enliveneth the 3 heavy hearts of the miserable. It maketh a man for- 4 get his brethren, and draw his sword against his best 5 friends. 0 ye Princes and Rulers, is not WINE the 6 strongest, that foreeth us to do these things? 7 S. M.: P. C., your argument is well chosen. 8 P. M. P., are you prepared to defend your position? 9~’ P. M. P.: [Arises and bows.] It is beyond dis - 10 pute, 0 Princes and Rulers, that God has made man 11 master of all things under the sun; to command them, 12 to make use of them, and apply them to his service as 13 he pleases; but whereas men have only dominion over 14 other sublunary creatures, KINGS have an authority 15 even over men themselves, and a right of ruling them 16 by will and pleasure. Now, he that is master of 17 those who are masters of all things else, hath no 18 earthly thing above him. 19 5. M.: P. M. P., your argument is both pleasing 20 and forcible, being well calculated to maintain the 21 dignity of the throne. And now, Prince Z, we will 22 hear the reason for your opinion, and for the impor - 23 tant addition you have made to our question. 24 C. C.: [Arises with Z and both bow.] 0 Princes 25 and Rulers, the force of Wine is not to be denied; 26 neither is that of Kings, that unites so many men in 27 one common bond of allegiance; but the superemi - 28 nency of WOMAN is yet above all this; for Kings are 29 but the gifts of WOMEN, and they are also the mothers ~0 of those that cultivate our vineyards. WOMEN have 31 the power to make us abandon our very country and 32 relations, and many times to forget the best friends 33 we have in the world, and, forsaking all other coin- 34 forts, to live and die with them. But when all is said, 35 neither they, nor Wine, nor Kings, are comparable to 36 the almighty force of TRUTH. As for all other 23 U"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"1 things, they are mortal and transient, but TRUTh 2 alone is unchangeable and everlasting; the benefits 3 we receive from it are subject to no variations or vi- 4 cissitudes of time or fortune.

M.: Z, ask what thou wilt, and we will give it thee, because thou art found wisest among thy companions. C. C.: 0 King, remember thy vow, which thou hast vowed, to build Jerusalem in the day when thou shouldest come to thy kingdom, and to restore the holy vessels which were taken away out of Jerusalem. Thou hast also vowed to build up the Temple, which was burned when Judali was made desolate by the Chaldees. And now, 0 King, this is that I desire of thee, that thou malie good the vow, the performance whereof, with thine own mouth, thou hast vowed to the King of heaven. S. H.: Prince Z, I shi b dn.

And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine and oil, according to the appoint - ment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

Ms. will frequently find it instructive to the candidate and edifying to the members to explain the ceremonials. The follow - ing is suggested as helpful to such an explanation: The Scriptures inform us that for their sins, and those of their forefathe rs, the Jewish people were led into captivity by Nebuzar-adan, Captain of~ the Guard of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon. As slaves they tilled the valley of the Euphrates and of the Tigris, until Cyrus destroyed the Chaldean dynasty. During that captivity, Zerubbabel, Crown Prince of the House of Judah, and Darius, son of Hystaspes, formed an alliance of friendship which was probably terminated only with death. One of the first acts of Cyrus was the liberation of the Jewish captives. He then permitted them to return to Judea, that they might rebuild the City of Jerusalem and its Temple, which Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed. The foundation of the Second Temple was laid five hun - dred and thirty-five years before Christ; Zerubbabel, the Royal Prince, Jeshna, the High Priest, and Haggai, the Prophet, laying the same. Cyrus died, and his son, Cambyses, succeeded him on the Medo-Persian throne. On complaint of the Cutheans, and other contiguous tinib~, Cambyses commanded the work of the City and Temple to cease. During the nine years that followed, scarcely anything was done on the walls of Jerusalem, or the Temple. Cambyses died and the Magians seized the throne, from which their usurper was driven, in a little over a year~ 30 31"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"with great slaughter. Then the Seven Great Families of Persia laid hold of the government, and Darius ascended the throne. He appointed Zerubbabel, his friend, to be Governor of the Jews that had returned to Mount Zion under the decree of Cyrus the Great, and aftewards ap - pointed him to that place of great trust—a guard of the Royal Bed-chamber—for the protection of the person of the King. There were three of these Guards, and they were ebosen by the Monarch because of his implicit con - fidence in their loyalty. Fifteen years after the Jews had laid the foundation of the Second Temple (520 B C) they were forced to call a Grand Council to consult about the state of the country. Cambyses was dead, and the Magian usurper, Smerdis, had been driven from the throne, to give place to Darius, son of Hystaspes, whose favoring of the Jews was believed to be almost as marked as that of the Great Cyrus. Darius spread a feast at his capitol, and invited thereto the Princes and Rulers of the realm. That feast was thoroughly enjoyed, and at its close “they every one de - parted to bed at their own house, and Darius the King went to bed.” The King slept lightly, and awaking he fell into con - versation with his Three Guards. He suggested, as a part of the festivities of the morrow, that they three engage in a public discussion of some interesting question, as had been the custom on similar occasions from time imme - morial, and that he would reward with a princely gift the successful contestant. The King then propounded the following question: “Whether Wine was not the strongest 7—Whether Kings were not such 7—Whether Women were not such, or whether Truth were not the strongest of all.” Esdras makes the Onards suggest both the questions and the prize, but we follow the story as told by Josephus. Again the King slept, and the Guards prepared for the 32 friendly contest of the following morning. W’hen the King arose he sent for the Princes and Rulers to meet him in the Audience Chamber, and witness the contest between his Guards, The contest began in time by one of the Guards de - claiming in favor of the strength of Wine, followed by another in favor of the power of the King. Then the Jew, Zorobabel, contended for the supeinerninency of Women, concluding with a noble deliverance in favor of Truth. The brilliant assembly burst forth into applause when Zorobabel concluded, and the King awarded him the prize, with these words: “Ask for somewhat over and above what I have promised, for I will give it unto you because of your wisdom.” Then “Zorobabel put him in mind of the vow he had made in case he should ever have the kingdom.” Now this vow was “to rebuild Jerusalem, and to rebuild therein the Temple of God, as also to restore the vessels which Neb - uchadnezzar had pillaged, and carried to Babylon.” And behold the King was pleased to arise and to kiss his eloquent Guard, Zorobabel, and to grant his request. Zorobabel returned to his people in Jerusalem with great joy, and the rebuilding of the City and Temple was imnie - diately resumed. Darius not only kept his vow, but made large contributions to the rebuilding out of the Royal Treasury. The details adopted to more beautifully round out the drama, and more pointedly teach the lesson of the almighty force and the iinl)ointance of Truth, do not intrench upon the facts of history. The 1 0 o t R C is not a Pagan rite nor is it a mere ~oeial observance. It is aA Ordcr founded upon Truth, and is a proper preparation for the solemnities of the o of t T.

It is the Maltese Cross. Its eight points are 12 symbolical of the eight languages into which the Or- 13 der was formerly divided.

The Sign and Grip: One says, “Reach hither thy finger and feel the print of the nails.” They join right hands and foree the first finger into the eenter of the palm. Then he says, “Reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side.” Eaeh extends his left hand and presses his fingers into the left side of the other, still holding on by the grip; with arms thus erossed they give the WORD. One says, “MY LORD ; “the other responds “AND MY GOD.” The name of this sign and grip is “Infidelitas”—unbelief. It teaehes us that there is an unbelief which transcends a ra - tional skeptieism; that we should possess a power of faith to reeeive Divine Truth, even though unaeeom - panied by physical evidence, and thus entitle us to that commendation of our Divine Teaeher, “Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.” 60 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 I will now invest you with the Grand Hai[ing Sign 2 and Grand Word of a Knight of Malta; also the 3 Grand Token and Word of the Order. 4 The Grand Hailinq Sign~: Place both hands to the mouth, as if speaking through a trumpet, right hand 6 in ftont of the [eft.

Interlace fingers of left hand, mov - ilig arms baekward and forward as if rowing a boat; the swords held upward in the right hands, saying together the Grand Word: “King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.” (10) Prior: The Pass-words of the Order are, Birth, Life, Death, Resurreetion, and Aseension.

While doing so we will pass by 17 the different eeremonial banners, and their signif - 18 ieanee in connection with the history and traditions 19 of the Order will be explained to you. [They proceed and halt at the first banner, “Birth.”] 20 Banner Guard: This Order was founded at Je - 21 rusalem in the year of our Lord 1099, by the asso - 22 ciation of a number of pious Knights with the fraters 23 of St. John’s Hospital, an establishment previously 24 formed (11) for the relief of pilgrims who had come 25 to worship at the Holy Sepulehre. 26 The name and date upon the white banner, “Birth,” 27 “Palestine, 1099,” eommemorates the country of our 28 Saviour ‘s nativity; the plaee where the Order was 29 founded, and the first epoeh in its history. [They pass to the second banner, “Life.”] 1 Banner Guard: After a troubled existenee of two 2 hundred years in the Holy Land, and being deprived 3 by the wars raging in Europe of needed and looked.. 4 for assistanee, the Order was compelled to evacuate 5 Palestine, and in 1287 it established itself on the 6 Island of Cyprus, and settled in Limisso. The name 7 and date upon the red banner, “Life,” “Cyprus, 8 1287,” eommemorates the second place of their so- 9 journing, and the seeond epoeh in their history. [They pass to the third banner, “Death.”] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 62 Banner Guard: On the fifth of August, 1310, the Island of Rhodes beeame the property of the Order by right of conquest from the Saracens. In 1312 the Order was strengthened in numbers and enriehed by the sequestered property of the Knights Templar, who were in that year suppressed by the cruelty and avariee of Pope Clement V and Phillip the Fair, King of Franee. This was the first direct approaeh to that union between the two Orders, which was subsequently formally decreed by the Pope. From this period they were known as the Knights of Rhodes. The remains of the fortifications ereeted there by the Knights, still bear testimony of their engineering skill and ability. In 1522 the Island of Rhodes was besieged by the Turks under the Emperor Solyman II, and after a memorable defense, their) fortifications being redueed to ruins, seareely one stone remaining standing upon another, they were eompelled to surrender and evac - uate the island, after an oecupaney of more than two hundred years. So deeply had their desperate prowess excited the admiration of their foes, and so 63"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"1 firmly implanted were the chivalrie ideas of the time, 2 even in the bosom of the infidels, that the Knights 3 were allowed to withdraw unmolested, and with the 4 honors of war. The name and date upon the blaek 5 banner, ‘‘Death,” “RhodeM, 1310,” commemorates 6 the third place of the sojourning of these valiant 7 Knights, and the third epoeh in their history. [They pass to the fourth banner, “Resurrection.”] 8 Banner Guard: During the period from 1523 to 9 1530 the Order ceased to exist as a sovereign power, 10 and the remnants of it wandered from place to plaee 11 without a home. During this most depressing period 12 in their history, they went, first to Castro in the 13 Island of Candia, thenee suceessively to Veniee, 14 Viturbo, Villa Franca, Syraeuse, and Messina. The 15 name and date of the pi.irple banner, “Resurrection,” 16 ‘‘Candia, 1523,” commemorates this the fourth 17 memorable period in the history of the Order. [They pass to the fifth banner, “Aseension.”j 18 Banner Guard: On the 24th of March, 1530, the 19 Emperor, Charles V, ceded the Island of Malta to 20 the Order, upon condition that they would defend it 21 and repress the ravages of the Moorish rovers, who at 22 that time infested the southern ports of the Mediter - 23 ranean Sea. Aceordingly, under L ‘Isle Adam, the 24 then Grand Master—one of the brightest iaines in the 25 history of the Order—they took possession of the 26 Island, and theneeforth aequired the additional title 27 of Knights of Malta. The name and date on the 28 yellow banner, ‘‘Aseension,” “Malta, 1530,” eom - 29 memorates this the fifth memorable peri6d in the his- 30 tory of the Order. 31 Marshal: The legend eonneeted with the ap - 64 1 proach of the Knights to their final and most re - 2 nowned abiding place has given rise to the distinguish- 3 ing Sign and Word of the Order. The tradition 4 runs, that on coming to take possession of the Island, 5 the Knights approaehed the shore in their galleys, two 6 men to an oar, the oars in their left hands and their 7 swords in their right hands, singing a psalm as they 8 rowed, in these words: “Rex Regum et Dominus 9 Dominorum” (English, “King of Kings and Lord of 10 Lords”. The islanders seeing them approaeh in 11 th is warlike manner, hailed them through a speaking 12 trumpet, saying in the Arabic language, “Ah tie toom 13 bis sah lahin?” (Do you ecine in peace?) To whieh 14 the Knights responded in the same tonge, “Ah tie nah 15 bissah lahin.” (We come in peaee.) Then the island- 16 ers responded, “Fa two bis sah lahin.” (Then come in 17 peace). it is worthy of note that these words, or sub - 18 stantially the same, are the eommon form of saluta - 19 tion between an Arab an(l a stranger at the present 20 day. (12) 21 We hold that the Order now eonferred upon you 22 has direct connection with the religious branehes of 23 the old Order. It preserves the memory of the union 24 that took plaee between the persecuted Templars and 25 the Knights of St. John, and whieh was continued in 26 Seotland, where the combined Orders held their lands 27 in common up to the time of the dispersion of the re - 28 ligious houses at the Reformation. We, as Masons, 29 perpetuate, cultivate and praetice the Christian and 30 chivalric prineiples of l 1 he Aneient Order, in eonnec - 31 tion with that of the Templars, as a peaeeful Chris- 32 tian society, to whieh we now weleome you as a 33 brother. 24 The Mediterranean Pass, which you reeeived in the 35 introductory degree of Knight of St. Paul, tradition 65 I N I,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"informs us, was instituted at an early period of the Order to enable pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land to recognize each other, and as a protection against the Moorish rovers who infested the Mediter - ranean Sea and Palestine. Aceording to the American Ritual seven officers eompose a Priory. They are the Prior, Lieutenant Commander, Captain General, Chaplain, Marshal, Captain of the Outposts, and Guard. The first five of these officers are supposed to be seated at the table in the East, on whieh is repre - sented the upper and transverse limbs of a Latin Cross. Their naked swords, when deposited on the table, all point to one spot—the center—where the heart of our Saviour rested when he suffered upon the Cross. This is symbolic in a degree of the Chris - tian character of the Order. The number 5 also symbolically reminds us of the passion of our Blessed Saviour, and of his five wounds upon the Cross. The number is again repeated in the rounds of the ladder, depieted in one of the quarters of the circle upon the Cross on the table in the West. A Knight at the Table in the West: There are eight Knights seated at the table in the West. Ac - cording to the European Ceremonial, these Knights are officers of the Priory. They represent the eight languages into which the Order was formerly divided, which were: Auvergue, Italy, Germany, Anglo-Bavaria. The table at which these Knights are seated has depicted upon it a large Maltese Cross, on the eenter of which is a cirele, divided into four equal quarter- Provenee, Franee, Aragon, Castile, 1 ings by two transverse bars erossing each other at 2 right angles in the center. Each of the four quarters 3 of the circle has a figure depicted upon it: 4 1. A ship or aneient galley. 5 2. A ladder, with five rounds or steps, with the 6 letters B. L. D. R. A., one on each step, and 7 a speaking trumpet. 8 3. A hand and a serpent. 9 4. A human skull, cloven in twain from the top 10 with a double-edged sword, and a spear be - 11 neath it. 12 The galley reminds us of the maritime eharacter 13 of the Ancient Order, both in war and commerce. 14 The letters on the steps of the ladder correspond 15 with those on the five eeremonial banners, and are the 16 initial letters of the pass-words on those banners. 17 The hand and the serpent reminds us of the his- 18 tory of St. Paul, in connection with the Island of 19 Malta. 20 The human skull, eloven by the two-edged sword, 21 reminds us of the penalty that was inflicted upon 22 traitors to the Order in ancient times. The spear again 23 reminds us of the passion of our Blessed Saviour, for 24 with sueh an instrument they pierced his side. 25 Marshal: I will now direct your attention to the 26 Grand Banners of the Order, of which there are two: 27 the Banner of St. John, and that of Malta. 28 Banner Guard: The Banner of St. John is red, 29 having painted upon it a white Greek Cross, the bars ~30 of the Cross extending to the edge of the banner, and 31 on the eenter of the Cross a “Pasehal Lamb.” The 32 letters F. E. R. T. are also on the banner, one in each 33 quarter. These are the initial letters of the four 34 words in the Latin sentenee, “Fortitudo ejus Rhoduin 35 tenuit,” whieh in English is “his eourage preserved 67 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 66"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"1 Rhodes.” Aceording to a tradition of the Order, these 2 letters upon the banner had their origin during the 3 Grand Mastership of Villaret, early in the fifteenth 4 century. In 1415 the Turks laid siege to Rhodes, 5 the new home of the Order, and were repulsed by the 6 brave Christian Knights. Amadeus V, Duke of 7 Savoy, having rendered timely and valuable as - S sistanee to the besieged Knights Hospitalers during 9 this attack, the Grand Master, in eomrnemoration 10 thereof~ caused the letters to be added to the Banner 11 of St. John. The descendants of the Duke Amadeus 12 have, since that time, always borne on their shield a 13 white cross, with the word FERT as a deviec; the 14 word being composed of the initial letters of the Latin 15 words, as before deseribed. 16 Banner Guard: The Maltese Banner is black, 17 having upon it a silver or white Maltese Cross, with 18 a Cross of St. John on a small shield resting on the 19 center.

[The reading ended, all re-cover and are seated.] Prior: I will now invest you with the Sign, Grip, and Word of the Order. The Sign and Grip: One says, “Reach hither thy finger and feel the print of the nails.” They join right hands and force the first finger into the center of the palm. Then he says, “Reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side.” Each extends his left hand, and presses his fingers into the left side of the other, still holding on by the grip; with arms thus crossed, they give the Word. One says, “Mv LORD;” the other responds, “AND Mv GOD.” The name of this Sign and Grip is “Infidelitas “—unbelief. It teaches us that there is an unbelief which transcends a rational skepticism; that we should possess a power of Faith to receive Divine Truth, even though unac - companied by physical evidence, and thus entitle u.s to that commendation of our Divine Teacher, “Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.” I will now invest you with the Grand 1-lailing Sign and Grand Word of a Knight of Malta; also the Grand Token and Word of the Order. Grand Hailing Sign: Place both hands to the mouth as if speaking through a trumpet, right hand in front of left. The Grand Word of a Knight of Malta: (Gives Grand Ilailing Sign) One says, “Do you come in peace?” The answer, ‘‘We come in peace.” The response, “Then come in peace.” The Grand Token and Word: Draw swords and come to a carry. Advance left feet and place them beside each other. Interlace fingers of left hand, 80 ii I 1 moving a rms backward and forward as if rowing a 2 boat; the swords held upwards in the right hands, 3 saying together the Grand Word: “King of Kings 4 and Lord of Lords.” 5 The Pass-words of the Order are BIRTH, LIFE, 6 DEATII, RESURRECTION, and AscENsION. These words 7 are used to commemorate the birth, life, death, resur - 8 reetion, and ascension of our Saviour. 9 Prior: Reverend Chaplain, you will read another 10 lesson from the Holy Evangelist. [All rise with the Chaplain and uncover.] 11 Chaplain: here beginneth the nineteenth verse of 12 the nineteenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. 13 John.

[The reading ended, all re-cover and are seated.] 15 Prior: The Sacred Word of the Order is “INRI.” 16 It is formed of the initials of the four Latin words 17 which were set up over the head of our Blessed 118 Saviour upon the Cross: “lEsus NAZARENUS, Rnx 19 IUDAEORIJM “—--Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the 20 Jews.

Companions (1) The Scotch Ritual calls for a Delta, or triangular table, in the center of the roam, and thirty-three lights distributed as follows: five on the table in the East, eight on the table in the West, five by the rounds of the ladder, and fifteen on the triangle. The Canadian Ritual omits these properties, and the Committee follows Canada. (2) The English and Scotch Rituals have many more officers: thus, the English have, 1st, Prior; 2d, Captain General; 3rd Lieu - tenant General; 4th, First Lieutenant; 5th, Second Lieutenant; 6th, Chaplain; 7th, Marshal; 8th, Hospitaler; 9th, Admiral; 10th Conservator; 11th, Bailiff; 12th, Turcopolier; 13th, Chancellor; 14th, Treasurer. The Committee has eliminated every officer not indispensable in the Ceremony. There are but four officers, the guards ex - cluded, who participate in the dramatic part of the Ceremonial during the investiture of the Candidate, viz.: Prior, Chaplain, Marshal, and Captain of the Outposts. (3) England, Scotland, and Ireland formerly constituted the sixth langue, but after the Reformation and the suppression of the Order in these countries Bavaria was added, and, toward the close of the Eighteenth Century, England was joined to that angue and afterwards known as “Anglo-Bavaria,” the eighth langue. Porter’s History of the Knights of Malta, Vol. 1, p. 259. (4) Upon occasions of extraordinary pageantry and display, these Knights might have banners with the arms of the respec - tive languages they represent. In that case the banners should precede them and be borne by Esquires in appropriate costume, each banner preceded by a Herald, clothed in the conventional costume. (5) There is no “Grand word” in our present Commandery vocabulary, but inasmuch as this word is in use in England and Canada, and as we have used the same word for a long time in another and less appropriate sense, the Committee retains and classifies it as above. (6) It is imperative: either this or the “Short Ceremonial” must be used in conferring the Order. 84 85"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"(7) Matthew, chapter 26, verse 67. (8) “When the Gospel was read or sung, they took their swords into their hands and held them with the point upward, to mark the continued disposition they were in to defend the faith.” St. Palaye, Memoirs of Ancient Chivalry. (9) These signs and words are not now in use in the United States, but have always been and are still used in England and Canada; and they are so pertinent to the traditions of the Order that the Committee has ventured to introduce them. (10) In some Priori es the Latin words are given as follows: “Rex Regnum et Dominus Dominorum.” (11) Founded circa 1048. (12) The Maltese language is a corruption of Arabic and Italian. These sentences are not purely Arabic: “Antum a tauitum besalam? Naham ataina besalam, ly ya salam laikam.” This, however, is of little consequence, as the English sen - tences only are used as mode of recognition in the degree. M’Leod Moore. (13) The description of the Maltese banner very nearly ac - cords with the engraving of it as given in Cross’s Templar Chart, 1821, and repeated in all subsequent editions. That is the earliest American pictorial illustration of the banner we have. The motto “Rez Regum et Dominus Dominorum” is not given as belonging to the banner in England or Canada, but it is pre-eminently ap - propriate, and having already been in use for more than fifty years in this country it is retained. The legend, “Rex Regum et Dominus Dominorum,” was incorrectly given by Cross, and the error has been perpetuated by all subsequent copyists down to the present time. (14) Revelation, chapter xix, verse 16. (15) This, or the “Long Ceremonial,” must be used in con - ferring the Orders. 86"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"ORDER OF THE TEMPLE K. T.

Chan~ty was taught you as a Mk M, Modera - tion as a P M, your industry was rewarded as a M E M, and when you passed under the Living Arch you received a lesson in humility. When you were created a Camp of the R C you were iinpressed with the almighty force and the importance of Trath. When you were adinitted a Knight of Malta, you were instructed to be zealous and vigilant for the honor of Knighthood. While the world is shut ant, meditate upon these things, and prepare your heart fan the solemn cere - monies through which you will be called to pass. There lies on the table before you a melancholy inementa of mortality. Beside it is an hour Glass, which I now reverse. As you behold its slawly4alling sands, learn that so surely are the wasting sands of your mortal life running ant to death. There is also on this table the Holy Bible, which is opened at the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. I enjoin upon you at this time tie reading of the thir - teenth to the sixteenth verses inclusive of that chapter. When you shall have concluded the reading you will discover three Questions, to which your explicit an - swers are required in writing. Reflect an thein, and then answer each with a simple “Yes” or “Na,” ac - cording to the dictates a~ your conscience. Then sign your name, IN FULL, to each of them. I am now about to leave you alone, and will signal iny departure by three knacks upon the door. Hear- 1 ing thein, you will reinove the h-w, and proceed as I 2 have directed. When you shall have concluded, give 3 three knacks, and I will attend you. [J. W. goes out, closes door, gives ~I4~ ~ When Cand knocks he will return.] 4 J.

And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare f or thee to eat the passover? And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The IViaster saith, my time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. And the disciplcs did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. Now when the even was came, he sat down with the twelve. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been goad for that man if he had not been barn. Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.”—Matt. xxvi :14-25.

Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here, and watch with me.

And he cometh unto’ the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, 0 my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. And he came and found them asleep again: f or their eyes were heavy. ,~ And he left them and went away again, and prayed the ‘7 third time, saying the same words. Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, A’ and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people.

This sacred book [Shows him the Bible] informs us that our blessed Saviour, after suEfening the pains of death, descended into the place of departed spirits; that on the third day He burst the bands of death, tri-. umphed ovcr the grave, and in due time ascended with transcendent majesty into heaven, where He now sits at the right hand of our 1-leavenly Father, a Mediator and Intercessor for all those who have faith in Him. I now invest you with an emblem of that faith [Pil- grim invested with a Cross] ; it is also a badge of our Order, which you will wear as a constant memorial to stimulate you to imitate the virtues of the Immacu - late Jesus, who died that you might live. Pilgrim, the ceremonies in which you are now en - gaged are intended to deeply impress your mind, and I trust they will have a happy and lasting effect upon your life and character. You were first, as a trial of your patience and perse - verance, required to perform Seven Years of Pilgrim - age. It represented the great pilgrimage of life through which you are now passing. We are all weary pilgrims, anxiously looking forward to that Asylum above, where we shall rest from our labors, and be at peace forever. 118 You were next, as a trial of your courage and con - stancy, required to perform Four Years of Warfare. It was to remind you of that continual warfare with the lying deceits and vanities of the world, in which it is necessary for you always to be engaged. You are now performing One Year of Penance, as a trial of your humility. Of this our blessed Saviour has left us the only perfect example; who, though He was the Eternal Son of God, humbled Himself to be born of a woman, to endure the pains and sorrows incident to human life, and finally to suffer the cruel and ignominious death of the cross. This penance is also a trial of that faith which will conduct you safely through the dark valley of the shadow of death, and land your enfranchised spirit in the peaceful abodes of the blessed. Pilgrim, ever keep in mind this solemn truth: you know not how soon you may be called upon to render an account unto the Supreme Judge, from whom the minutest act of your life is not hidden. Although you now stand erect in all the pride and strength of manhood, yet in a few brief moments you may be cold in death. This moment, even while I speak, the angel of death may receive the dread mandate to strike you from the roll of the living; and the friends who now surround you be called upon to perform the last sad duty of laying you in the earth, a banquet for worms, and this frail body become as the relic you hold in your hand. “Man that is born of ~ woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. In the - midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek for succor but of Thee, 0 Lord, who f on our sins ant justly dis - pleased ‘1 Yet, 0 Lord God, most holy, 0 Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Savioun, deliver us not into the 1 2 3 4 5 ~ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ~)~i23 24 25 26 27 28 29 119"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"1 2 3 4 5 6 8 bitten pains of eternal death.” “And I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me, > Write: Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labouns; and their works do follow them.” Pilgrim, be you always ready, and rest assured that a firm faith in the truth herein revealed, and a child. like trust in our crucified and ascended Saviour, will not only afford you consolation in the gloomy hour of dissolution, but will also secure you ineffable and eternal happiness in the world to come. Farewell! Even remember the hallowed sacrifice on Calvary. [P. returns to Asylum, and Ws conduct the Pil Pen thither. While walking S. W. will say,] S.

As if you were such a K, allow me now to address you. Attracted by the chivalrous deeds of the Ts,—for their deeds of charity and pure beneficence had spread their fame both far and wide,—you sought admission to their ranks, the better to fulfill that vow. The Cindin of the Coindry of Ks T to which you ap - plied for admission, being satisfied with the report made to him of the uprightness of your character, was moved to grant the prayer of your petition; but as a trial of your worthiness to be enrolled among the members of the Val and Mag Order of the Tple, he enjoined upon you Seven Years of Preparation. Those years began with an un - armed pilgrimage in the direction of the Holy Shrine, and an escort was given you, who would guide and protect you. Without sword or buckler, and forbidden to do acts unbe - coming a mere Pilgrim, your journey began; and to a man of warlike spirit, such a pilgrimage was indeed a trial of patience and perseverance. Three years passed as you trod your weary way, mostly in a friendly country, in which you received from pious anchonites bread and water, a~ well as lessons of comfort and consolation. But day after day, during these years, your manhood asserted itself with accumulating vigor,— when you beheld indignities offered, not only to yourself but to other helpless Pilgrims, many of them delicate 133"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"woinen,—and you yearned to cast off the garb of a Pil - grim, and, laying aside the staff, to grasp the sword and perform deeds of exalted usefulness. Thus yearning, and pleading with your devoted escort, you reached another Coindy of the Ts. Three years of the required preparation had passed, and you begged your escort to crave permis - sion from the Coindin to permit you to devote the four re - maining years to deeds of more exalted usefulness. At this second house of the Ts your escort made known your burning desires, vouched for your integrity, and that you had faithfully performed the duties of three years of your preparation. The avouchinent of your escort secured the favorable consideration of the Comdr, who, after putting you under Vows, granted you permission to take up sword and buckler, and to go forth, under escort of a Tple Warrior, manfully wielding your sword in the de - fense of innocent maidens, destitute widows, helpless orphans, and the Christian Religion. And such a warfare was indeed a trial of your courage. As a Pilgrim Warrior you pressed forward with forti - tude undaunted, giving ample proof to your warrior escort that you were worthy to bear your sword in the cause to which you had consecrated it. And the constant opportuni - ties to display your valor and chivalry created in you an ardent desire to be admitted where honors and rewards await valorous deeds. Three years passed while you thus manfully fought your way toward the shrine of your Vow. At the close of the third year you reached another house of the Ts, and there you besought your escort to implore remission of the remaining year of preparation. Your Tplr escort presented your petition to the Cmdr of that Coindy, and avouched for your valor, courage and constancy, even recommending the remission aslied far, if it were possible; and though the Comdr was moved by the recital of your deeds of courage and constancy, the num - ber of the years of preparation could not be shortened. Moreover, he feared that the memories of those valorous deeds had filled your heart with pride, and that self-con - fidence had supplanted an humble reliance upon the strong arm of the Master. He therefore commanded you to de - vote the remaining year of your preparation to penance, as a trial of your faith and humility. The penitential year accomplished in and about that Coindry,—duning which you received lessons of piety, before representations of the Sepulchre and the Ascension of our Saviour,—you were permitted to return to the Asylum, and to participate in the Ffth Lbtn, thereby sealing your Faith, after illus - trating both it and your humility. You were then enlisted under the Ban of the Ts and of Emmanuel. Such, S K, is the brief epitome of the solemn ceremonies through which you have passed. The ancient Order of the T was suppressed and its members dispersed, and the war - like spirit of that Order has passed away; but in this modern Order of the T there remains a spirit of refined and moral chivalry, which should prompt all of its mem - bers to be ever ready to defend the weak, the innocent, the helpless and the oppressed, and in a brother’s cause to do all that may be demanded by manhood and fra - ternity. And now we hail you K as well as Brother. Sacredly observe the Vows you have taken. These Vows bind you to the Order, and to each of us as comrades in arms. May we all at last ‘‘Be greeted as Brethren, and received into the~ widely extended arms of the Blessed Emmanuel.” END OF THE VAL AND MAO ORD OF T T. 134 135"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ODE TO THE SKULL. BEHOLD this ruin! ‘tis a skull, Once of ethereal spirit full; This narrow cell was life ‘s retreat, This space was thought ‘s mysterious seat; What beauteous visions filled this spot, What dream of pleasure long forgot, Nor joy, nor grief, nor hope, nor fear, Has left one trace on record here. Beneath this mouldening canopy. Once shone the bright and busy eye; Yet start not at the dismal void! If holy love that eye employed, If with no lawless fire it gleamed, But through the dews of kindness beamed, That eye shall be forever bright, When stains and sun are sunk in night. Within this hollow cavern hung The ready, swift and tuneful tongue; If falsehood’s honey it disdained, And when it could not praise, was chained; If bold in virtue ‘s cause it spoke, Yet gentle concord never broke, That silent tongue may plead for thee, When time unveils eternity.

Hunsberger, Ph.D. and Maurice E. White, P.G.O. Nornistown, Pennsylvania 1935 140 141"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"FOREWORD Every Templar recognizes keenly the desirability of accuracy and uniformity in the pronunciation of all the words used in conferring the several Orders. Many of these words used by the Knights Templar present especial difficulties of pronunciation to those unfamiliar with historic references and foreign lan - guage practices. The present short list of such words has been prepared for the purpose of seeking to make the beautiful work of Templary more impres - sive in its exemplification by procuring uniformly accurate pronunciation of those words used. Every word here listed has been studied in connec - tion with some recognized authority on pronuncla - ~ tion. Those references used were: Funk and Wag- nails’ Standard Dictionary, The Century Dictionary, Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, and Phyfe-’s 18,000 Words Often Mis proinounced. Each word in this list is accented and the pronun - ciation indicated by diacritical marks, just as the word is shown in the dictionary. But for the con - venience of those who do not easily read the mark- ABBREVIATED as in writer, the i as in fine, delight, idea. 1 as in sit, dissect. 6 as in hope, echo, doe, 6 as in coral, hot, pot. as in ate, ale. ~ as in cat, garret. as in banana, sofa. ii as in calm, far, cart. 5 as in even, meet, key. ~ as in edge, end. ings in the dictionary, the pronunciation is indicated by what may be called a common phonetic represen - tation. Where this representation may not be per - fectly clear, some comparison or suggestion is given in connection with the word. In the case of those words which admit of more than one pronunciation the first or preferred pronunciation is given; only in a few instances is a second or accepted pronuncia.. tion copied. Latin words and phrases are indicated in one of two ways: (1) if the Latin has been Anglicized, this pronunciation is indicated; (2) but those Latin words and phrases which do not appear in the dictionaries are indicated as Latin is commonly pronounced to - day. In particular, the c in each Latin word is pro - nounced like k. French words are pronounced like modern French. The pronunciation of these words is particularly dif - ficult to represent on paper. •Whenever possible the person interested should have some one who knows French pronounce these words in his hearing.
