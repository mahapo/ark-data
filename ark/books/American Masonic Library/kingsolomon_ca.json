Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that unbiased by friends and uninflu-. enced by mercenary motives, you freely and voluntarily offer yourself as a candidate for the mysteries of Masonry? II. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you are prompted to solicit the privileges of Masonry by a favorable opin~ ion conceived of the Institution, a desire for knowledge, and a sincere wish to be service - able to your fellow creatures? III. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you will cheerfully conform to all the ancient established usages and cus - toms of the F~raternity? As you have answered these questions sat - isfactorily, I will now leave you in the charge of these gentlemen, who will prepare you to receive the First Degree of Masonry. It will be necessary for you to be divested of all minerals and metals, and so much of your clothing that you will be neither naked nor clad, bare foot nor shod. Satisfactory rea - sons will be given you for these and all things else required of you. For the present it is sufficient to say, that you will be asked to submit to nothing, except that to which all persons who have preceded you, have been required to submit. (Stds tk cdt t prp inin.

The Twenty-four Inch Gauge is an instru - ment made use of by operative Masons to measure and lay out their work. But we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glo - rious purpose of dividing our time. It, be - ing divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematic of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three parts, whereby we find a part for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother; a part for our usual vocations’; and a pant for refreshment and repose. The Common Gavel is an instrQment used I I by operative Masons to break off the rough and superfluous parts of stones, the better to fit them for the builder ‘s use. But we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glori - ous purpose of divesting our hearts and con - sciences of all the vices and superfluities of life; thereby fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

A Lodge is a certain number of brethren duly assembled, with a Holy Bible, a Square and Compass, and a Charter or Dispensa - tion authorizing them to meet. A Charter is an instrument emanating from a Grand Lodge, and, in this jurisdic - tion signed by the Grand Master and Grand Secretary, authorizing certain brethren therein named, when duly assembled, to Ini - tiate, Pass, and Raise all good men and true who may apply for the purpose and whom they may find worthy. A Dispensation is a like instrument, issued by the Grand Master during the recess of the Grand Lodge, which for a limited period, confers similar powers. Our ancient brethren assembled on the highest hills and in the lowest vales, the bet - ter to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers. The Form of a Lodge is oblong. It ex - tends from east to west and from north to 36 37"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"south, and it is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Masonry and to teach us that a Mason ‘s charity should be equally extensive; for in every country and in every clime are Masons to be found. A Lodge is metaphoricall~r said to be sup - ported by three great pillars, denominated Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty; it being necessary that there should be Wisdom to contrive, Strength to support, and Beauty to adorn all great and important un dertak - These ings. pillars are represented in the Lodge by the Worshipful Master, the Senior and Junior Wardens. The Covering of a Lodge is no less than the clouded canopy or star-decked heaven where all good Masons hope at last to arrive by aid of that theological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw, reaching from earth to heaver, the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity; which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity for all mankind. The greatest of these is Char - ~ty; for our Faith may be lost in sight, Hope ends in fruition, but Charity extends be - yond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. Every regular Lodge is furnished with a Holy Bible, Square and Compass. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God, it be - ing His inestimable gift to man, as the rule and guide of his faith; @ on i al ~s r obgtd; the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compass to the Craft, for by due at - tention to its use, we are taught to circum - scribe our desire and keep our passions within due bounds toward all mankind. The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor o~ King Solomon ‘s Temple, and is emblematic of hu - man life, checkered with good and evil. The Indented Tessel is a representation of the beautiful tessellated border on skirting which surrounded the pavement, and is em - hiematic of the manifold blessings and com - forts which surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a faithful reliance upon Divine Providence, hieroglyphically represented by ~he Blazing Star in the center. The Lights of a Lodge are three, situated in the East, West, and South. As you may observe, there is none in the North, because King Solomon’s Temple, of which every todge is a repr~sentation, was situated so far north of the Ecliptic that neither the Sun nor Moon, at meridian height, could 88 39"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"I dart its rays into the north part of the build - ing. The North, therefore, among Masons, has always been termed a place of darkness. The Jewels of a Lodge are six; three im - movable, and three movable. The Immov - able Jewels are the Square, the Level, and the Plumb; and they are termed immovable because they are the jewels of the three prin - cipal officers of the Lodge, the Worshipful Master, the Senior and Junior Wardens, who are always stationed in the East, West, and South. The Square denotes morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of life. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ash - lar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board. The Rough Ashlan is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and nat - ural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adjusted by the working-tools of the Fel - low Craft. The Trestle Board is for the Master Workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfec - tion at which we hope to arrive by a virtu - ous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle Board we are reminded that, as the operative work- I I man erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle Board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the great book of nature and revelation, which is our spir - itual, moral, and Masonic Trestle Board. Lodges are situated due East and West because Moses, after having been instrumen - tal in conducting the children of Israel through the Red Sea when pursued by Pha - raoh and his hosts, by divine command erected a tabernacle which he placed due east and west, to commemorate the mighty east wind by which their miraculous deliv - erance was wrought. This tabernacle was an exact model for King Solomon’s Temple, for which reason all Masonic Lodges are, or should be, situated due east and west. Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solomon, as it is said that he was our first Most Excellent Grand Master. Lodges at the present time are dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of ~asonry; and since their iime there is, or should be, represented in every regular Lodge a cer - tain point within a circle—the point repre - 40 41"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"senting an individual brother, and the circle the boundary line of his conduct, beyond which he should never suffer his passions, his prejudices, or his interests to betray him. This circle is supported by two perpendicu - lar parallel lines, representing Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, and on its top rest the Holy Writings. In tracing its circumference we necessarily touch upon the parallel lines and also upon the Holy Bible, and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he can materially err. The three principal tenets of Masonry are Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. By the exercise of Brotherly Love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family,—the high and the low, the rich and the poor,—who, as created by one al - mighty parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion; and causes true friendship to exist among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. To relieve the distressed is a duty incum - bent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the un - happy, to sympathize with. their misf or- 42 tunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. Truth is a divine attribute and the foun - dation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate; and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocriSy and deceit are unknown among us; sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us; and with heart and tongue, we join in promoting each other’s welfare and rejoiC - ing in each other’s prosperity. ~smkthslkflbcr§s,atk,a ~d@HPfPt%en §s@ntan,hr ~p~;~~kiaenfg,whbonbro ma kn atin i -H dk as wi as in +1 U; awdisil nrn%atkfl.

ThuofValtfv ORDERS OF ARCHITECTURE By order in architectare is meant a sys - tem of all the members, proportions, and or - naments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect and com - plete whole. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons first obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a cov - ering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint origi - nally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The Five Orders are thus classed: the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Com - posite. The ancient and original orders of archi - tecture, esteemed b~r Masons, are no more than three, the Daric, ionic and Cori’nthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Rornans added two, the Tuscan, 93 92"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"which they made plainer than the Doric. and the Composite, which was more orna - mental, if not more beautiful, than the CQ - rinthian. The first three orders alone, how - ever, show invention and particular charac - ter, and essentially differ from each other; the two others having nothing but that which is borrowed, and differing only acci - dentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Co - rinthian enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are iiidebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. Thnmfvaisalut4l fvsns%hum iiatur: hrng, seng, feing, smi @ tastg.

A point is the beginning of all geomet - rical matter. A line has length, without breadth or thickness. A super/ice has length and breadth, with - out thickness. A solid has length, breadth and thickness. By this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general, to arrange his soldiers; the en - gineer, to mark out grounds for encamp - ments; the geographer, to give us the dimen - sions of the world and all things therein con - tained, to delineate the extent of seas, and to specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations and to fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the founda - tion of architecture and the root of mathe - matics. ~winwinksti (Dn.) weli bgs us t auth advc in bin, aplrps-H otdr 95"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"% MC%KST,wchwwlfdprtoP btcls grb -H 10, whwl dm %u -H ps@tk%-H ps,%aFc~),crel1Wi grnt u adm. lx is -H ps @t-s itt. 1 ~- J U * (Rs.) oh ems hr. ~ ~- A Fe on hs (or, FCsonthr) w ta p1. rpsg th MC KS1.

Itis-Hitl% Geometry, the first and noblest of sci - ences, and the basis upon which the super - structure of Freemasonry is erected. By Geometry we may curiously trace nature through her various windings to her most concealed recesses. By it we discover the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Great Artificer of the Universe 3 and view with de - light the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their respective orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season dis - plays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observati~i of her beautiful proportions, first deter - mined man to imitate the Divine plan, and 99 98"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"to study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design; and the plans which he laid down, being improved by time and experience, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ig - norance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity on which the ut - most exertioru of human genius were em - ployed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still sur - vived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tan g’~te, and the mys - teries of Masonry are safely lodged in the repository of faith fut breasts. Tools and implements of architecture, most expressive, are selected by the Fraternity to imprint upon the memory wise and serious truths; and thus, through the succession of ages, are transmitted unimpaired the most excellent tenets of our Institution.

Masonry is a progressive moral science, divided into different degrees; and, as its principles and mystic ceremonies are regu - larly developed and illustrated, it is in - tended and hoped that they will make a deep and lasting impression upon your mind. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the du - ties which, as a Fellow Craft, you are bound to discharge. Your general good reputation affords satisfactory assurance that you will not suffer any consideration to induce you to act in a manner unworthy of the respect - able character which you now sustain; but that, on the contrary, you will ever display the discretion, the virtue, and the dignity which become a worthy and exemplary Mason. Our laws and regulations you are strenu - 101 100"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate nor aggravate the offenses of your brethren; but, in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friend - ship, and reprehend with justice. The impressive ceremonies of this degree are calculated to inculcate in the mind of the novitiate the importance of the study of the liberal arts and sciences, especially of the noble science of Geometry, which forms the basis of Freemasonry, and which, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; for, while it proves the wonderful properties of na - ture, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. To the study of Geom - etry, therefore, your attention is especially directed. Your past regular deportment and up - right conduct have merited the honor which we have conferred. In your present charac - ter it is expected that, at all our assemblies, you will observe the solemnities of our cere - monies; that you will preserve the ancient usages and customs of the Fraternity sacred and inviolate; and thus, by your example, induce others also to hold them in due ven- eration. Such is the nature of your engagements a~ a Fellow Craft, and to a due observance of them you are bound by the strongest ties of fidelity and honor. ~E~r C (@ if others, BrE, etc.), bfucnbrst-H sh 0 % it wib ucs fr u t crot t rum a prt ~ -H lctr % ths ‘~.

And we especially beseech Thee to impart Thy grace to this Thy servant, who offers himself as a candidate to partake with us the mysterious secrets of a Master Mason. Endue him with such fortitude that in the hour of trial, he faint not, but pass him safely under Thy protection through the valley of the shadow of death that he may finally arise from the tomb of transgression and shine as the stars forever and ever.

We also learn from the same sacred source that David, King of Israel, desired to build the house, but that, in consequence of his reign having been one of many wars and much bloodshed, that distinguished privi - lege was denied him. He was not, however, left without hope, for God promised him that out of his loins there should come a man who would be adequate to the performance of so great and glorious an undertaking. That promise was verified in the person and character of Solomon, his son, who ascended the throne, and, after David was gathered to his fathers, wielded the sceptre over Israel at a time when (as the great Jewish histo - rian, Josephus, informs us) peace and tran - quillity pervaded the world, and all eyes seemed directed toward Jerusalem, as if to witness the splendid display of the wisdom of Solomon. About this time King Solomon received a congratulatory letter ‘from Hiram, King I I I j 162 of Tyre, desiring to participate, in a small degree at least, in the rich honors which then seemed to be clustering around his throne. In his reciprocations with Hiram of Tyre, King Solomon desired him to fur - nish a man well skilled in the arts and sciences, and his attention was directed to H A, a wd sin % -i-i trb % Napth, @ we urn tt Sum sent @ hd Hinin bint out % Ty; @ ~vin ± primary argint fin ± eret % th bldg were einpid it ws comned in ± frth yr % ± rgn % Slin und ± ausp % thin grd mst, S K % Is, HyK%T,@HA,btmPrlYuind-H imd dtn insp A, tw s, wi ws ± arhtc % ± wk; @ w iv ths evg, my bin, rps a tin, wci ~c trdtn infins us, aetly tk pc win K S T ws nin its cmphi,@wirsitdi± dti%± GM H A; hs dti ws prm, t cm atng it win as fiws: Fftn Fcs, seng ± Tm nin its cmplni @ frg tt ti wd nt b abi t obt ~ ~s wgs win try in fin cnts, ent mt a enspy t itint fin +1 GMHA -H scts % a C’~ or tkhs lf.

In it, also, many particulars relative to the build - ing of King Solomon’s Temple are noticed. That famous fabric, as I before informed you, was commenced in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon, on the second day o~ the month Zif, being the second month of the sacred year. It was located on Mount Mo~ riah, near the place where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and where David met and appeased the destroying an - gel. It was supported by fourteen hundred and fifty-three columns and two thousand nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. There were employed in its erection three Grand Mas - ters, three thousand three hundred Masters or Overseers of the work, eighty thousand Fellow Crafts or hewers on the mountains and in the quarries, and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices or bearers of burdens; and these were all so classed and arranged by the wisdom of Solomon that neither envy, discord, nor confusion was suffered to inter I rupt or disturb the peace and good fellow- ship which prevailed among the workmen; exc i ± sngi instnc wch w iv ts evng inpinsntd @ wci nsuitd in -H dti % ± GMHA, and, as a striking evidence of the approba - tion and interposition of Divine Providence, we are informed by the great Jewish his - torian Josephus that, although more than seven years were occupied in its building, yet during the whole term it did not rain in the day time, but in the night season only, that the workmen might not be obstructed from their labors. From sacred history we also learn that there was not heard the sound of axe, hammer, or any tool of iron in the house while it was building, it having been put together in the manner described to you in a preceding degree.

EMBLEMS The hieroglyphical emblems explained in this degree are— The Three Steps: The Pot of Incense: The Bee-hive: The Book of Constitutions, guarded by the Tyler ‘s Sword: The Sword, pointing to a Naked Heart, and the All-Seeing Eye: The Anchor and Ark: The forty-seventh Problem of Euclid: and The Hour glass and Scythe. Tie explanation of these is to be found in the monitor which has been adopted by the Fraternity as a text book and with which it is hoped that you will soon make yourself familiar. Following is Monitorial work alluded to in the Lecture. Tie Three Steps usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet, are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life: Youth, Manhood, and Age. In Youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to oc - cupy our minds in tM attainments of useful knowledge; in Ma~nhood, as Fellow Crafts, 174 175"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"we should apply our knowledge to the dis - charge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor, and ourselves; that so, in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflection consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immor - tal ity. The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacri - fice to the Deity; and, as this glows with fer - vent heat, so should our hearts .continually glow with gratitude to the great and benefi - cent Author of our existence, for the mani - fold blessings and comforts we enjoy. The Bee Hive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven, to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us, that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sit - ting down contented while our fellow-crea - tures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them, without inconvenience to ourselves. When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless and indi - gent than the brute, creation; he lies Ian-, guishing for days, months, and years, totally 176 incapable of providing sustenance for him - self, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth, to have made man inde - pendent of all other beings; but as depen - dence is one of the strongest bonds of so - ciety, mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the com - mon stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of na - ture, a useless member of society, and un - worthy of our protection as Masons. The Book of Constitutions, Guarded by the Tyler ‘s Sword, reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words, and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry; ever bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and circumspection. The Sword, Pointing to a Naked Heart, demonstrates that justice will sooner or 177"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that All-seeing Eye, whom the Sun, Moon and Stars obey, and under whose watchful care, even Com - ets perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human Heart, and will reward us according to our merits. The Anchor and Ark are emblems of a well-grounded hope, and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that divine ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. The Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great PYTHAGORAS, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa and Europe, was initiated into several orders of Priest - hood, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher en - riched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems; and, among the most distinguished, he erected I this, which, in the joy of his heart, he called Eureka, in the Grecian language signifying 1 have found it; and upon the discovery of which he is said to haye sacrificed a heca - tomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. The Hour-Glass is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We can not without astonishment be - hold the little particles which are contained in this machine; how they pass away almost imperceptibly! and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they are all ex - hausted. Thus wastes man! Today, he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow, blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick ~ipon him; the next day comes a frost which nips the shoot.; and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like au - tumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. The Scythe is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold what havoc the Scythe of Time makes among the human race! If by chance we should escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth and, with health and vigor arrive to the years of mau~ihood, yet withal we must 178 179"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"soon be cut down by tie all-devouring Scythe of Time and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us.
