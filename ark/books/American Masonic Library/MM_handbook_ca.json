It is the culmination of all that has been taught and revealed to the candidate in the two preceding degrees. As he began his Masonic journey, the candidate was initiated into a new philosophica l life in the Entered Apprentice degree. After working to subdue his passions and learni ng silence and obedience, the candidate was passed to the degree of Fellow Cr aft. After having symbolically mastered the intellectual and philosophical arts and sciences and crossed the th reshold from the outer to the inner, from the material to the spiritual, he became ready to be raised to the Sublime degree of Master Mason. Regardless of the candidate’s pace through the de grees, he should always review his personal progress and take action to impr ove himself in Masonry. He shoul d not be satisfied with only taking the degrees and then consid er himself to be a Master Ma son. Very few are truly Masters of the Craft, and it is important to maintain a meaningful deference for this exalted status. The designation of Master Mason is al ways before every Mason in th e journey toward the Light as the ideal of the fraternity. Being raised to the Sublime degree refers to bein g exalted or elevated. It also means to undergo sublimation that, like distillation, requires a volatilizati on of a substance that rises and re-forms at a higher level. The significance of this degree is the portrayal of the re moval of everything that keeps us from rising to that state where the soul communes with the Divine . It also represents a symbolic rebirth into the spiritual world, the true abode of the soul. Master Mason Degree SYMBOLISM OF THE DEGREE The candidate enters the lodge of Master Masons in darkness. While he has not witnessed the Light of this degree before, he is now in a state of equilibrium and is prepared to walk on sacred ground. The initiate is given full use of every wo rking tool, but the one tool exalted above the others from this point on is the one that symbolizes the spreading of Brotherly Love. After ceremonies in the first section, which seem quite familiar, the candidate now partakes of the central mystery of the Masoni c Order. In this degree, the l odge becomes a representation of the Sanctum Sanctorum, or Holy of Holies, within King Solomon’s Te mple of Jerusalem. Participating in this rite is a matter of forging a link with the innermost as pects of the fraternity. THE WORKING TOOLS The working tools of a Master Ma son are “all the instruments of Masonry.” In the United States, the trowel is especially assigned to this degree. The Master Mason uses the trowel to cement ties between Masons, and to spread Brotherly Love. A lthough all the tools are available to the Master Mason, it is the trowel with which he must now work."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 THE HIRAMIC LEGE ND AND REBIRTH The historical Hiram Abiff that is recorded in the Bible was a skilled ar tificer and the son of a widow of the Tribe of Naphtali. The earlier accounts of Hiram are recorded in I Kings 7:13–14. His coming to work on the temple at Jerusalem is mentioned in a letter written to King Solomon by Hiram, the King of Tyre, and recorded in II Chronicles 2:13–14. The wo rd Abiff is variously translated, but can mean “his father,” and the name is often explained as “H iram, my father.” In a certain sense, he was regarded as the father of the workmen on the temple. His role in the Hiramic legend of Masonic tradition, however, is far more than simply that of a skilled architect. The Hiramic legend has at its heart the slaying and symbolic restoration of an ideal of purity and order. Because the legend of the Grand Master Hi ram Abiff is consistent with the teachings and rites of the Ancient Mystery Schools, the partic ipant of the Masonic ri te communes with the archetypal forces that are the founda tion of human spiritual tradition. Initiation into the Ancient Mysteries was not simp ly a means of attaining intellectual knowledge, or “learning” ( mathein in ancient Greek). Aristotle wrote th at it was actually the “experience” ( pathein ), and not knowledge learned, that allowed th e initiate to comprehend the secret meaning of the mysteries. This enlightening, transformative experience has generally been termed rebirth, or renatus in Latin, and appears to be the central theme of the most important rituals of almost all the Ancient Mystery Schools as well as m odern initiatic organizations. At Eleusis, the teaching on rebi rth was revealed through the symbolism of Kore’s descent into the underworld, her ascension from it , and the subsequent return of fe rtility. In the cults of Osiris, Dionysus, Attis, and Adonis, the main rite is thei r violent death and rebirth. In Mithraism, we find representations of Mithras slaying a bull w hose blood turns into grain. In Christianity, the unjust crucifixion of Christ leads to the ultimate redemption of mankind. And within Freemasonry we learn of the murder of our beloved Grand Master Hiram Abiff by three impatient craftsmen and his subsequent raising. According to many enlightened th inkers, the three strikes to our Grand Master’s body symbolize the same vices that combined together to slay Christ. Namely, the corruption of the church, the oppression of the state, and the ignorance of the mob. Whether or not the blows are indeed symbolic of the same social vices that had combined to take the earthly life of Christ is probably a matter of opinion, but what is clear is that the ruffians had not been able to “subdue their passions” and were thus driven by them to co mmit the terrible act. Because the Fellow Crafts allowed themselves to be governed by their pass ions, they murdered the qualities of a master within themselves. It is for us, th erefore, to learn to subdue our pa ssions so that the master within each of us may be raised. In this sense, one of th e lessons of the legend of Hiram Abiff is that of undying fidelity to the highest ideal s and the ultimately victorious nature of such convictions."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 Masonic tradition informs us that the master’s murd er leads to the loss of the word, leaving it to be discovered in future ages. This may suggest th at mankind is yet to receive its salvation as a whole, while at the same time re vealing the path to individual en lightenment within the allegory of the legend. But however one may wish to in terpret the Hiramic lege nd, it is clear that the death and raising of Hiram presents some kind of teaching on rebirth. It only follows then that the doctrine of rebirth is something every dedicated Mason should become familiar with. But before proceeding to rebirth, it may first be necessary to understand what causes the death in the first place. It appears that all the violent deaths—of Osir is, of Christ, of Hiram—have something in common. They symbolize vice, ignor ance, and chaos, inevitably slaying the pure self and thereby making rebirth necessary for salv ation. These legends rev eal the nature of our circumstances and enlighten us to the trials th at we must overcome. On ly through the death of one’s imperfect self, the leaving behind of the ol d, and acceptance of transcendent truth, can one truly be reborn into a new self, no longer tainted by the sins of one’s past. In a certain sense, and depending on one’s perspective or religious back ground, rebirth or regenera tion is a process that is constantly occurring. With such an understanding, it is up to the initiate to ensure that he is improving himself on a daily basis by carefully watching and analyzi ng his behavior and motives. It should be recognized that the doctrine of re birth as a means of regaining one’s purity or rediscovering one’s true self ha s had great influence on the Chri stian doctrine of original sin. Christianity teaches that because of the fall fo llowing the transgression of Adam, all humanity has inherited a state of sin, with re birth in Christ the Savior and in the life of the spirit as the only way to salvation. Within Islam, on the other hand, the doctrine of original sin is rejected because Allah accepted the repentance of Adam after th e fall (Qurân 2:36–37) and thereby showed that each man is responsible only for his own acti ons, though still subject to temptation and folly. While it seems unclear which understanding is closer to what was taught in the various Mystery Schools of the ancient world, it does seem clear th at regardless of the tradition one looks at, most would agree that man is constantly subject to temptation and almost alwa ys gives in sooner or later. A good source for Freemasons to examine in the quest to overcome vice and temptation and understand rebirth is cited in the Cooke Manuscript of the Old Charges to operative Masons in England ( circa 1450). This manuscript regards Hermes Tr ismegistus as the principal patron of the Craft. Some writers have even speculated that the name Hiram Abiff actually comes from Hermes Ibis. While this is unlikely, this connect ion may have merit only if Hiram is considered to be a symbol of the knowledge professed by Herm es that has become lost for most of humanity due to the vices of men. The main body of surviving Hermetic wisdom is called the Corpus Hermeticum and, incidentally, book 13 of the Corpus is entitled On Rebirth . The text is in the form of a dialogue between Hermes Trismegistus and his son Tat. Tat begins by asking his father to reveal the teaching on rebirth, by saying that he is now “ready to become a stranger to the world,” as this was the condition that Hermes had previously set forth. Hermes then expl ains that all things come from God, and are one with God, and it is Hi s will only that determines who shall achieve rebirth. The dialogue continues with Hermes teachi ng Tat that it is only through mastery of self and transcending of the senses that the Divine intellect, or Nous , can be discovered."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 SON OF THE WIDOW Regarding Hiram as the “Son of the Widow,” it s hould be noted that the Egyptian god Horus, as the child of Isis and Osiris, was also the son of a widow. Hermes Trismegistus was called the stone “orphan.” The Manichaeans were called “children of the widow.” Etymologically, the word individual is also re lated to the word widow. Vidua , Latin for widow, derives from the verb videre , meaning “to part.” THE WAGES OF A MASTER MASON Our ancient, operative Brethren performed ma nual labor and receiv ed wages which would contribute to their physical welfar e. These nominal wages were corn (wheat), wine, and oil. The wages of a speculative Mason, however, must come from with in, as he is concerned more with moral, rather than physical, labor. The rewards of love, compassion, friendship, and brotherhood are the wages of a Master Mason. Not everyon e works hard enough to earn them, however, which is why the Senior Warden in the opening of the lodge declares: “To pay the Craft their wages, if any be due ... .” THE THREE GRAND MASTERS The Three Grand Masters mentioned in our ritual s concerning the building of the Temple are: Solomon, King of Israel; Hiram, King of Tyre; an d Hiram Abiff. Traditionally, Divinity has been thought of in three aspects. Th e secrets known only to these Thr ee Grand Masters typify Divine truth, which was known only to God, and was not to be communicated to man until he had completed his own spiritual temple. Once these secrets were attained, a man could reap the rewards of a well-spent life, and travel to th e unknown country toward which all of us are traveling. TRAVELING IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES The goal of our ancient operative Brethren was to become masters, so they might possess those secrets which would enable them to practice the art of the architect, no matter where they traveled, even in foreign countries. The term “foreign countries” is used symbolically in speculative Masonry, and is not meant to refer to a certain geographical location. Freemas onry itself is a forei gn country to those not initiated into its rites. To fully appreciate and en joy the privileges of the Craft, the new initiate must become familiar with the territory of Freemasonry by learning its language, customs, and history. Once raised, Freemasons must continue their journey into the depths of the Craft and continue to search for Light and truth wherever it may be found. The term “foreign countries” may also be a me taphor for the spiritual worlds. The ancients concerned themselves with vast spiritual worl ds, and their method of gaining admission through various spiritual spheres was through secret pa sswords, grips, signs, and sometimes angelic names, and holy words."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 LOW TWELVE In ancient symbolism, the number 12 denoted co mpletion. This sign arose from the 12 signs of the zodiac being a complete circle and the 12 edge s of the cube being a symbol of the earth. The number twelve signified fulfillment of a deed, a nd was therefore an emblem of human action and life. High Twelve corresponds to noon, with the sun at its zenith, while Low Twelve denotes midnight, the blackest time of the night. THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH The lion is an ancient symbol of royalty. Du e to its majesty and power it has long been considered the “king” of beasts. Its likeness is commonly found on the thrones and palaces of rulers. It was also associated w ith the sun because of its mane. The lion was the sign of the Trib e of Judah, because this was th e royal tribe of the Hebrew nation. All kings of Judah were cal led the “Lion of the Tribe of J udah” and this was, therefore, one of the titles of King Solomon. The Mithraic god Aion had a human body with a lion’ s head. Because of its association with the sun and its correspondence to the zodiacal sign of Le o, the lion is also considered a symbol of alchemical fire. In the Middle Ages, the lion was also underst ood as a symbol of resurrection. There were common tales that the lion cub when born lay dead for three days until breathed upon by its father and restored to life. Re presentations of roaring lions sy mbolized the resurrection of the dead on the Last Day. THE LOST WORD The search for “that which was lost” is not neces sarily for a particular word. Our search is a symbol for our feeling of loss or self-imposed exile from the Divine. The search is ultimately for Divine truth. The book of Genesis gives us a clue to the power of speech. In it, we learn that the first act of creation occurred when “God said.” The utterance of the Word is al so closely connected with the idea of Light, and therefore, knowledge. Having the power of speech is perhaps the noblest attribute of man, because he can communicate his thoughts to his fellows. Thus, the Word has been carried down through the ages as being syn onymous with every manifestation of Divine power and truth. We must always search di ligently for truth, and never permit prejudice, passions, or conflicts of interest to hinder us in our search. We must keep our minds open to receiving truth from any source. In the Craft lodges, there is a subs titute for the true Word. Each in itiate must ultimately seek out and find the true Word for himself, through his own individual efforts. Some Masonic scholars speculate that the names of the three ruffians provide a hint at the lost Wo rd. Indeed, there is an allusion to the sacred syllable of the Vedic texts found in these names. Either way, the true Word is a symbol, or manifestation, of that higher order that maintains the world."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 THE SETTING MAUL This was a wooden instrument used by operative masons to set polished stones firmly into a wall. The maul has been understood as a symbol of destruction from prehistoric times, and is portrayed often in mythology in this capacity. One of the best known is that of Thor, God of Thunder, a powerful figure armed with a mighty hammer. THE SPRIG OF ACACIA The acacia is a thorny plant, with red and white flowers, that abounds in the Middle East. Both Jews and Egyptians believed that because of its hardiness, its evergreen nature, and its durability, it signified immortality. Hebrew peopl e used to plant a sprig of acaci a at the head of a grave to mark the location of the grave and to show thei r belief in immortality. B ecause of its evergreen nature, they believed it to be an emblem of bot h immortality and innocence. In Egypt, acacia also symbolized rebirth and was an emblem of Neith. It is believed that the acacia was used to constr uct most of the furniture and the tabernacle in the Temple. It is a tradition in the Near East th at the Crown of Thorns was made from acacia. KABBALISTIC ALLUSIONS OF THE THIRD DEGREE Traditional Jewish mysticism known as Kabbala, and particularly its use of Gematria, often provides interesting clues to the in terpretation of passages of Script ure. Since much of our ritual is derived from Scripture, many Masonic schola rs see various Kabbalis tic allusions throughout the rituals of Freemasonry. For example, using the Kabbalistic discipline of Gematria, the Hebrew spelling of Hiram Abiff equals the number 273. The Hebrew term for “hidden light” and the phrase found in Psalms 118:22, “the stone refused by the builders,” each a dd up to 273. Some students of Gematria view crossing languages in this pursuit as acceptabl e (so long as the languages employed follow the same traditional letter-numbering system of the an cient world). An example of this approach may include the Greek word athanasia , which means “immortality,” and also adds up to 273. From the standpoint of Gematria, th is would be a significant correlation. HIEROGLYPHICAL EMBLEMS In The Three Pillars we have the Three Gr eat Supports of Masonry—wisdom, strength, and beauty. The Three Steps remind us of how yout h, manhood, and old age are each an entity in itself, each possessing its own duties and problem s, and each calling for its own philosophy. The pot of incense teaches that to be pure and blameless in our inner lives is more acceptable to God than anything else, because that which a man really is, is of vastly greater importance than that which he appears to be. It is also a symbol of prayer and me ditation. The beehive recommends the virtue of industry and teaches us that we s hould never rest while our fellow creatures are in need of assistance. Bees have often been regarded as symbols of messengers from the heavens."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 The Book of Constitutions guarded by The Tiler’s Sword is the emblem of law and order, and reminds us that our moral and spiritual character is grounded in law and morality as much as is government and nature. It teaches that no man can live a satisfactory life who lives lawlessly. The Sword Pointing to a Naked Heart symbolizes th at one of the most rigorous of these laws is justice, and that if a man be unjust in his heart, the inevitable results of injustice will find him out. The All Seeing Eye shows that we live and move and have our being in God; that we are constantly in His presence, wherever or whatev er we are doing. The single Eye is found in many countries from Egypt to India: The Eye of Horus, the Eye of Shiva, and so on. The Anchor and Ark represent the sense of secur ity and stability of a life grounded in truth and faith, without which sense there can be no happine ss. The Forty-Seventh Problem of Euclid, or the Pythagorean Theorem, is a very important sy mbol in Freemasonry. It is the Sacred King of the scalene (limping) triangles, and its properties have implica tions in many different areas. Plutarch wrote that the Egyptians attributed the holy family of Osiris, Isis, and Horus to this specific triangle: Osiris the vertical (3), Isis the horizontal (4), and Horus the diagonal (5). After Osiris is killed, Horus be comes the Son of the Widow. In the Hourglass, we have the emblem of the fleeting quality of life. The Scythe reminds us that the passing of time will end our lives as well as our work, and if ever we are to become what we ought to be, we must be faithful, work diligently, and not delay. Duties and Rights of a Master Mason The constant duty of a Master Ma son is “to preserve the reputati on of the fraternity unsullied.” Leading a good life is the best m eans of carrying through individual responsibility to one’s lodge and the Craft. The conduct of each Master Mason is his own responsibility, and he must always strive to choose the course which will bring credit to himself and honor to the fraternity. In his actions toward his fellow brothers, Master Masons must al ways practice Brotherly Love. If your brother should slip, offer your hand to him without judgement or harsh criticism, and remember that if tempted in the same way, you yourself may have fallen. LODGE ATTENDANCE There is no mandatory attendance requirement as in ancient lodges and no penalty for not attending. However, every Master Mason has an ob ligation to be loyal to the lodge which gave him Masonic Light and all the benefits which come with his membership. You should attend your lodge as often as possible and join in th e fellowship that is an important part of Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 MASONIC RELIEF Masonic Relief may be applied for by any Mast er Mason—either to his own lodge, or to an individual Master Mason. In ev ery case, the individual asked ha s the right to determine the worthiness of the request and whether such aid ca n be granted without material injury to his family. Relief is a voluntary function of both the lodge and the individual. If the lodge’s financial condition will not allow it to hel p, he can apply to the Grand L odge for help. In order to be eligible for Masonic Relief, the br other must not have been suspende d in the past five years, and there can be no charges pending against him at th e time of application. The widow or orphan of a Master Mason, who was a member of the lodge at the time of his death, is entitled to consideration if they apply for assistance. The same conditions as to worthiness and the ability and willingness of the lodge apply in these cases. MASONIC VISITATION Visitation of other lodges is one of the greatest privileges of being a Master Mason. Before you can sit in another lodge, you must prove yourself to be a Mason in good standing and have permission from the Master of the lodge. In order to attend another lodge, it is important to learn the memory work and modes of recognition in each degree, and have your paid-up dues card with you. You can gain admission to another lodge in one of two ways—examination or avouchment by a brother who has sat in lodge with you previously. THE RIGHT OF BURIAL The Masonic funeral service is conducted only at the request of a brother or member of his immediate family. The choice belongs to the family, not to the lodge. This service can be held in a church, the lodge room, funeral parlor, or grave site . It is a beautiful and solemn ceremony and, like Masonry itself, does not conflict with a man’s personal religious beliefs. BALLOTING Only members in good standing have a right to vo te. No member present can be excused from balloting on any petitioner before the lodge. No member will be permitte d to retire from the lodge to avoid casting his ballot . In California, the white ball indicates an affirmative, or favorable, ballot, and the black cube indicates a negative, or unfavorable, ballot. If there is no reason to believe otherwise, the report of the investigating committee is usually accepted, and a favorable ballot is cast on a petition for membership. If there is an objection to an applicant, it should be raised before the ballot is taken. Every Freemason has the right to speak to the Master pr ivately and express any concerns or objections he may have about the applicant. If there is some legitimate r eason to indicate why the petitioner is unworthy, for strictly Masonic—not personal— reasons, a black cube may be cast to protect the lodge from an undesirable member. As you approach the ballot box, examine your motives and be sure that the ballot you are about to cast will do justice to the candidate and Freemasonry. The right to secrecy of the ballot is guaranteed by Masonic law, and custom allows each member to have full freedom in balloting on petitioners. No brother should disclose how he voted and no brother should inquire into how another brother voted on a particular candidate."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 DEFINITIONS OF NON-AG E, DOTAGE, AND FOOL In the jurisdiction of California , non-age refers in this degree to one who is not yet 18 years of age. Dotage is a condition associated with old age, and is marked by juvenile desires, loss of memory, and failure of judgement. Being old doe s not bar someone from seeking membership, but it is required that he be mentally alert and healthy. A fool is a grown man without good sense. Legally, he may be of age, but mentally he is incapable of the kind of understanding required to be successful in Freemasonry. EXAMINING VISITORS This responsibility belongs to the lodge and is delegated by the Wors hipful Master to a committee of Brethren who are to satisfy themselv es that the visitor is a Master Mason in good standing in a regular and recognized lodge. The Worshipful Mast er may call upon any member of the lodge to serve on the examining committee. Kindness and courtesy should be shown to all visitors at all times. VOUCHERS ON PETITIONERS Before endorsing the petition of anyone for initiati on into the Masonic Order, it is necessary to determine the applicant’s motives for initiation, his expectations, a nd the quality of his character. A man must be of good moral character and show himself to be capable and desirous of intellectual and ph ilosophical growth. Signing the petition of a man who wishes to beco me a Freemason is a significant responsibility, and by doing so you are committing to assist him as he grows in Freemasonry. INVESTIGATING PETITIONERS This responsibility belongs to every member of the lodge and should not be taken lightly. Serving on an investigating committee should be re garded as a mark of special trust by the Master of your lodge. It is a solemn responsibilit y. Only those who can be counted on to make a complete and impartial inquiry into the petiti oner’s character and determine his worthiness to become a Freemason should be selected. The me mbers of the investigating committee are known only to the petitioner and to the Wors hipful Master who appointed them. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES Your financial responsibilities are twofold. Fi rst is the mandatory payment of annual dues. Second are voluntary support contribu tions to certain charities, distressed worthy brothers, and other Masonic organizations, as you desire. By pa ying dues, each brother carries his share of the expenses to run the lodge. Rega rding voluntary financial support, he must determine the extent of his participation, measuring the need agains t his ability. Any member failing to pay his dues for a period of more than twelve months is subject to suspension."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 There is no reason a brother should be suspended for nonpayment of dues. Not being able to pay dues can be handled easily and without embarrass ment. No lodge desires to suspend a brother who is unable to continue payment of dues. A di stressed brother should inform the Worshipful Master or the Secretary of his situation. One of th ese officers will take care of the situation so no record is shown on the books and no debt is accumulated. This is not Masonic charity, but, rather, Brotherly Love. In most cases, the othe r Brethren in the lodge know nothing about his situation. LODGE MEMBERSHIP Although Entered Apprentices are considered full Masons, in Ca lifornia one does not become a member of a lodge until after bei ng raised. Termination of membersh ip can occur in one of four ways: dimit , suspension, expulsion, or death. One can a pply for a dimit (or transfer to another lodge) if his dues are currently paid up and he is otherwise in good standing. One can also hold plural or dual membership in multiple lodges. Th is sometimes occurs when one lodge raises a candidate who then moves to another area and wa nts to become active in a new lodge. One must be a member of a lodge in order to become an of ficer there. Plural membership refers to being a member of more than one lodge in this jurisdicti on (California), while dual membership refers to being simultaneously a member in this jurisdic tion and in a lodge of another jurisdiction. The Secretary of each lodge should have access to the nece ssary paperwork. A Mason can be suspended for nonpayment of dues or “un-Masonic conduct.” If suspended for nonpayment of dues, it is possible to apply for rein statement. At any time, back dues for the year of nonpayment plus the current ye ar must be paid. If suspende d for un-Masonic conduct, it is possible to be reinstated by fo llowing certain procedures. If c onvicted of un-Masonic conduct by trial, the trial board may direct expulsion from the Masonic Order. The verdict can be appealed to the Grand Lodge. A Mason suspended or expelled from a lodge may lose his membership in all Masonic organizations. ENTERING OR RETIRING FROM AN OPEN LODGE Courtesy dictates that Freemasons should always arrive before a meeting is scheduled to begin. This also allows sharing of fellowship, meeting any visitors who may be arriving, and so on. If you arrive after a meeting has begun, you shoul d clothe yourself properly, inform the Tiler, and ask to be admitted. The Tiler will inform the Junior Deacon, who will then request permission from the Master that you be admitte d. The Junior Deacon w ill notify you when it is appropriate to enter and of the degree in whic h work is taking place. When permitted to enter, proceed west of the altar, give the due gua rd and sign of the degree, and take a seat. Retiring from an open lodge is accomplished in much the same way. Move west of the altar, give the appropriate due guard and sign, and then leave."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 DEPORTMENT WHILE IN THE LODGE Your deportment while the lodge is open s hould be governed by good taste and propriety. You should not engage in private c onversations, nor through any other action disrupt the business of the lodge.

If you wish to spea k, rise and, after being recognized, give the due guard and sign, and then make your remarks.

Th e seven elected officers are the Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, Senior Gr and Warden, Junior Grand Wa rden, Grand Treasurer, Grand Secretary, and Grand Lecturer. The Masonic law is codified in a document cal led the California Masonic Code (CMC). Every member of a lodge and every Masonic organization in this jurisdiction must adhere to the rules and regulations of the CMC. Failure to do so may be grounds for disc iplinary action. Every California Freemason is encouraged to become familiar with this document. Each year during the Annual Communication (late September or early October), the members of Grand Lodge meet at the Califor nia Masonic Memorial Temple in San Francisco and conduct the business of the Grand Lodge. During Annual Co mmunication, resolutions are presented and voted on by the Grand Lodge. Each member of Grand Lodge has one vote, except the Grand Tiler, who has no vote, and Past Masters of each lodge, who have one collective vote for their whole lodge. Thus, each lodge in th is jurisdiction has four votes to tal: one for the Master, one for each of the Wardens, and one for its Past Ma sters as a group. All Master Masons in good standing are permitted to attend these sessions but may not vote unless they are members of Grand Lodge. Resolutions introduced by California Masons before the Grand Lodge must receive a 5/6 affirmative vote for adoption. Legisl ation receiving less than 5/6 but greater than a majority of the ballots is carried over to the next year’s session, where it must receive a 2/3 affirmative vote for passage. Resolutions receiving less than 1/ 2 fail. The Grand Master is permitted to make Recommendations and Decisions, which are spec ial kinds of legislation. Legislation which passes is adopted as part of th e California Masonic Code (CMC). Every year, the results of the Annual Communication are recorded in the Grand Lodge Proceedings. The California Grand Lodge manages two total car e homes in Union City and Covina for aged Brethren and their widows. The Masonic Home in Covina also cares fo r disadvantaged children, both those who are related to a Mason and those who are not. THE GRAND MASTER The Grand Master of Masons of California is el ected for a one-year term by the members of the Grand Lodge. Almost without excep tion, he has served the prior three years as Junior Grand Warden, Senior Grand Warden, and then Deputy Grand Master. The Grand Master is the chief executive officer of this jurisd iction, and his powers and responsibil ities are wide and varied. In brief, he may grant dispensations, convene and preside over any lodge, arrest the charter or dispensation of any lodge, suspend the Master of any lodge from the exercise of his powers and duties, and officiate at the layi ng of cornerstones. The Grand Mast er also acts on behalf of the Grand Lodge when it is not in session."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 During his term, the Grand Master is sometime s called upon to interpret the California Masonic Code. He may consult with the Jurisprude nce Committee on the matter, but the final determination is his to make. Th is interpretation of the CMC is called a Grand Master Decision.

Th e Grand Master may also offer his Recommendations to the Grand Lodge. These are treated like any normal resolution brought before the Grand Lodge, except that the Reco mmendation of a Grand Master often carries notable influence. The Executive Committee consists of the Gra nd Master, the Deputy Grand Master, and the Senior and Junior Grand Wardens. In the abse nce of the Grand Master, one of these other officers presides on his behalf. THE GRAND SECRETARY The Grand Secretary is the chief administra tive officer of the Grand Lodge. He has many responsibilities, most especially managing the staff and day-to-day operations of the Grand Lodge office. He is also responsible for servi ng as Secretary for various Grand Lodge Boards and Committees, recording all tran sactions of the Grand Lodge pr oper to be written, maintaining important documents and papers of the Grand Lodge, and conducting th e correspondence of the Grand Lodge. He also receives Resolutions, Deci sions, and Recommendations presented to the Grand Lodge for Annual Communication, maintains membership statistics, and more. THE GRAND LECTURER AND RITUAL COMMITTEE In matters of ritual, this jurisdiction is divided into five geographical Divisions, each of which is under the supervision of an Assi stant Grand Lecturer, who is a ppointed each year by the Grand Master. These five Assistant Grand Lecturers receiv e instruction in the ritual and report to the Grand Lecturer, who is an elective Grand Lodge officer. Each of these Divisions is further subdivided in to Districts, which are overseen by an Inspector. Each Inspector is usually accountable for about four lodges. The Inspector oversees the ritual work and is also the representative of the Grand Ma ster within the District. He is authorized to ensure that the administration of each lodge in his District is handled properly. Within each lodge, an Officers’ Coach, appointed by the Inspector, sees that the ritual wo rk of that lodge is done properly. BOARDS AND COMMITTEES The Grand Lodge maintains a number of boards and committees, each of which has a specific responsibility within the overall structure of the Grand Lodge. Boards and standing committees are mandated by the California Masonic Code. Th e Grand Master may also convene any number of special committees at his pleasure. All me mbers of Grand Lodge boards and committees are appointed by the Grand Master a nd are usually Past Masters, but a limited number of Master Masons may be appointed as well. Members may serv e for only nine years, with five of those as President or Chairman, unless the Grand Master feels that circumstances warrant a longer term."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 Every Grand Lodge presides over one Masonic juri sdiction. It is the supr eme Masonic authority within that jurisdiction. Its authority extends not just to the lodges under its control, but also to each of the Appendant and Concorda nt Bodies within its confines. Jurisdictions vary in size and composition. In c ountries around the world th at have Freemasonry, there is a single Grand Lodge for the entire c ountry. The United States a nd some other countries have multiple Grand Lodges, but each has a certai n exclusive territory in which it operates. Still other places have multiple Grand Lodges acting with in the same territory, each responsible for its own lodges. Currently, there are 51 mainstream Grand Lodges in this country—all 50 states and the District of Columbia. A Grand Lodge serves as the administrative center for a Masonic jurisdicti on. It sets policies and procedures, ensures that rules and regulations are being followed, maintains the esoteric work according to the ancient usages, charters new lodges, provides information and assistance to its constituent lodges, and so on. Constituent lodges are responsible for paying per capita to the Grand Lodge for its upkeep and maintenance. This money comes from the annual dues of the membership of each of the lodges. Each lodge must also adhere to all of the ru les and regulations adopted by the Grand Lodge. However, the authority of the Grand Lodge is derived from the lodges. Individual lodges can exist without a Grand Lodge, but a Gra nd Lodge cannot exist without lodges. Officers of a Masonic Lodge There are five elected officers of a Masonic lo dge: the Worshipful Master, Senior Warden, Junior Warden, Treasurer, and Secretary. The Ma ster appoints the Chaplain, Senior Deacon, Junior Deacon, Marshal, Senior Steward, Junior Steward, Tiler, and Organist. The Master, Wardens, and Senior Deacon must be proficient in the work of their respective positions, and the District Inspector must certif y their proficiency. Any qualified member may be elected by the lodge to hold office."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 Graphic illustrating lodge room and officers’ stations "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 Regularity and Recognition One of the most complicated areas of Masonic juri sprudence, or law, relates to the standards a Grand Lodge must follow in order to be considered regular . Each Grand Lodge has its own set of standards, and since there is no central governing authority within Freemasonry, determining regularity is difficult and subjective. Space does not pe rmit a comprehensive list of all the issues associated with standards of regularity , but some examples include : acceptance of candidates irrespective of their personal religious beliefs; the Holy Bible, square, and compass displayed upon the altar at all times; the acceptance of men only; the Hiramic legend as an integral part of the third degree; and so on. In the late nineteenth century, Masonic historian Albert G. Mack ey published a list of 25 ancient landmarks of Freemasonry. A landmark is supposed to be an integral part of the Craft and can never be changed. Mackey’s list has served as the basis of regularity since its publication, but confusion arises because each Grand Lodge de termines its own set of landmarks. Some jurisdictions use all 25 la ndmarks as presented by Mackey. Others have a shorter li st. Still others, like California, refer to the ancien t landmarks but do not define them. Regularity is, therefore, a subjective term. It depe nds on the perspective of the one making the determination, and a Grand Lodge may be considered regular by one jurisdiction and irregular by another. In contrast to regularity , the concept of recognition is purely objective. Recognition refers to the state of amity between two Masonic Grand Lodges. The relationship is similar to that between nation-states, and since each Grand Lodge is s overeign, it decides for itself which Grand Lodges it will recognize and which it will not. When two Grand Lodges share recognition , their members are permitted to visit one another and, in most cases, hold membership in lodges of bot h jurisdictions if they so desire. The only Brethren permitted to visit our lodges are those from Masonic jurisdictions recognized by the Grand Lodge of California. It is the responsibility of the Master, or his designee, to make this determination and to ensure that all visiting Masons are from a lodge under a recognized Grand Lodge. The book List of Lodges Masonic is published annually and in cludes a comprehensive list of every Grand Lodge and their constituent lodges recognized by the Grand Lodge of California. Every lodge Secretary should have a copy of this book in his office. WOMEN AND FREEMASONRY When Masonry was operative, the masons were a ll men, and as the Craft became a fraternity its membership continued to be male. This pr actice has continued dow n through the years. Some Masonic organizations do admit women, but they are not recognized by the Grand Lodge of California. In California, wome n are included in the family of recognized Freemasonry through concordant Bodies, such as the Order of the Eastern Star, the Order of Amaranth, and others."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 PRINCE HALL MASONRY In 1783, a free black man named Prince Hall was made a Mason in Massachusetts by a traveling Irish military lodge. Hall wished to form a lodge but was denied dispensation by the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. He sent his petition to the Grand Lodge of England, and after 12 years, he received a charter for Afri can Lodge No. 459 on their rolls. This lodge eventually led to the first “Prince Hall” Grand Lodge. Since that time, Prince Hall Grand Lodges have spread across this countr y, much like mainstream Grand Lodges. For 200 years, these Grand Lodges were unrecognized and considered irregular . It is only very recently that Prince Hall Masonry has started to be accepted by the mainstream. It should be understood that th e separation between Prince Ha ll Masonry and mainstream Masonry was not entirely one-sided. Prince Hall Masons are justifiably proud of their Masonic heritage, and there was some con cern on their part that recogniti on would lead to problems for their jurisdictions. However, there can be no doubt that racism played a large part in the gulf between mainstream Freemasonry and Prince Hall Freemasonry. In 1989, the United Grand Lodge of England ex tended recognition to the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. Connecticut and Massachus etts soon followed with recognition of their own. Since that time, many Prince Hall and mainstream Grand Lodges have extended recognition to one another. As of 2005, 32 of 51 mainstream Grand Lodges were in fraternal accord with their Prin ce Hall counterparts. The Grand Lodge of California recognized th e Prince Hall Grand Lodge of California and Hawaii, Inc. at its 1995 Annual Communication. We are now permitted to visit their lodges, and they are permitted to visit ours, without restri ction. Dual membership is not permitted, however, because Prince Hall Masonic Code expressly pr ohibits their members from joining lodges outside their jurisdiction. The Grand Lodge of Ca lifornia is also in fraternal accord with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Oregon, Ha waii, Pennsylvania, and Washington. Appendant and Concordant Bodies After being raised, a Master Mason may choose to join any number of Masonic appendant Bodies. The two most common appendant Orders are known as the Scottish Rite and the York Rite. SCOTTISH RITE The Ancient & Accepted Scottish Rite (AASR) is an additional system of degrees dating to the 20 th century which are designed to add further Light to one’s An cient Craft lodge experience. The Scottish Rite is divided into four interrelat ed Bodies, each of which deals with the recovery and meaning of the true Word of a Master Ma son. The Scottish Rite system progresses through 33 degrees, but it is accepted that the highest degree in Masonry is the third degree. Thus, the Scottish Rite degrees are properly called additi onal degrees, rather than higher degrees."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 YORK RITE The York Rite is a confederation of three inde pendent Masonic Bodies: the Royal Arch Chapter, the Cryptic Council, and the Knights Templar Commandery. The Royal Arch deals with the recovery and meaning of the tr ue Word of a Master Mason. Th e chapter confers four degrees. The degree of Royal Arch Mason is often described as the most spiritual and mystical of all the degrees of Freemasonry. The Royal Arch is also known as a “gateway” degree, and membership entitles one to join certain smaller rites and Orders, such as the Allied Masonic Degrees, Knights Masons USA, Red Cross of Constantine, and so on. The Cryptic Council confers three degrees which help explain how the true secrets of a Ma ster Mason were safeguarded until the time when future ages should discover the Light. The Kn ights Templar Commandery is the third Body of the York Rite. It is Christian in character and content, and describes the passage of pilgrims on their way to Jerusale m during the Crusades. SHRINE Master Masons are also eligible to join the Anci ent Arabic Order, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, more commonly known as the Shrine, a benevolen t and social organization. The Shrine is particularly well known for the many hospitals it maintains for the care of children. This care is offered to all children in need at no cost to them or their families. It is supported entirely from the donations of members of that Body. OTHERS There are other rites, degrees, and organizatio ns one may join upon becoming a Master Mason, depending on one’s interests in charity, fellowship, or further Light in Masonry. California has four research lodge s, each of which is dedicated to promoting scholarly Masonic study and discussion. The Philaleth es Society is an internatio nal organization of Masonic research and offers memb ers a quarterly publication, The Philalethes magazine, which includes Masonic information from around the world. The Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foeder atis (the Masonic Rosi crucian Society of the United States) is an invitational Body open to Ma ster Masons. It is c onsidered to be more esoterically inclined. The Allied Masonic Degrees is another invitatio nal Body open to Royal Arch Masons. It is a collection of various degrees and the members ofte n engage in scholarly research and discussion. The Order of the Eastern Star, Order of the Am aranth, and the White Shrine of Jerusalem are popular concordant Bodies which admit both me n and women. Often, they provide the chance for a husband and wife to share in the fraternal experience together. There are also three Masonic youth orders in Ca lifornia, which include boys and girls (and young men and young women) in the family of Freemas onry: The International Order of DeMolay for Boys, the International Order of Job’s Daughters, and the In ternational Order of Rainbow for Girls. Each of these appendant and conc ordant Bodies is an important part of the larger family of Freemasonry in California, and each must obey the rules and regulations of the Grand Lodge."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 Recommended Reading New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry By Arthur E.
