This handbook is designed to introduce the new Entered Ap prentice to the vast body of knowledge associated with Freemasonry in a meani ngful and understandable way. It is intended that through the intellectual study of Freem asonry the Entered Appr entice will come to understand that the application of Masonic teachings in daily life is the most rewarding aspect of his new journey. The best way to use this handbook is to read through it as soon as possible, but also to continue to use it as a reference s ource in one’s continued Masonic development and study of the Masonic mysteries .* In studying Freemasonry, every Mason discovers that there are many aspects to the organization. They can be divided into three main categories— philosophic, historical, and organizational. The philosophic aspect of Freemasonry introduces the student to the profound subjects of initiation , symbolism, and tradition , and their potential to impact his li fe for the better. The historical aspect teaches the student how th e traditions and teachings that make up Masonry came to be, their central role in the spirit ual search of mankind, and the way Masonry has affected the world since its emergence. The organi zational aspect helps the studen t understand how the organization is governed and perpetuated, and provides many oppor tunities for the devel opment of leadership skills and an improved sense of personal responsibility. While studying Masonic symbolism, history, and organization can be interesting and exciting, the goal is to be able to translate the lessons and experiences that one gains from Masonry into one’s daily actions. Freemasonry, if approached with humility, an open heart, and an open mind, will make one a gentleman, a better family man, a nd a better citizen. It should also be understood that while Freemasonry is not a religion, it does encourage its memb ers to be active in their own religious traditions. Freemasonry What is it, what is its purpose, and how does it differ from other organizations? Freemasonry is a traditional initiatic order. It is not a secret society, but ra ther, a society with secrets. While it took its modern form during the Enlightenment, its traditions, symbols, and lessons reach back to pre-modern times. The general work associated with the initiatic tradition a nd the purpose of Freemasonry, put simply, is to provide an environment where good men can come together to pursue meaningful intellectual and spiritual growth. It is often said that Freemasonry “makes good men better.” One of the underlying tenets of the initiatic tradition is the belief that with each individual that becomes a better person, the entire world profits. Being part of the initiatic tradition is what distinguishes Freemasonry from purely social or philanthropic organizations. While there are many different organizations that contribute large sums of money to charity, offer fellowship with like-minded men, or provide education, Freemasonry is unique in that it embodies all thes e things, but is actually focused on offering men a traditional initiation into the mysteries of life and death. The initiatic tradition is the core, defining characteristic of Freemasonry, without wh ich there would be nothing to differentiate Masonry from other social or philanthropic organizations.   * Terms appearing in bold on their first occurrence in this handbook can be found in the Glossary."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 Initiation is a slow and sensitive process and requ ires great effort on beha lf of both the candidate and the existing members of the lodge. For th e initiatic experience to be meaningful and enriching, great care and attention must be a fforded to each individual candidate. If the new Freemason is to become worthy of the title, he must spend time and energy learning about the history, symbolism, and philosophy of the Craft. There is no way around it. The process of experiencing the initiatic traditi on, becoming a part of it, and improving oneself through its lessons is known as Masonic Formation . This is an ever-continuing process of spiritual and intellectual form ation that all Freemasons must continuously undergo. Masonic Formation is the process of fitting the Rough Ashl ar of our imperfect be ing into the Perfect Ashlar fit for the Divine temple. It is a c onstant transformation through the use of Masonic symbols, rituals, and teachings on a journey of return to the center of our being. W. L. Wilmshurst, in his book Meaning of Masonry , writes, “the very essence of the Masonic doctrine is that all men in this world are in search of so mething in their own nature which they have lost, but that with proper instruction and by their own patience and industry they may hope to find.” Initiation, Rite, and Tradition Freemasonry: a traditional institution that practices r ites as a means of preserving and perpetuating the initiatic tradition. Inherent in the traditional character of Freemasonry is that initiatic rite s are viewed as a necessary and perpetual aspect of a Divinely maintained natural order. In this sense, Freemasonry is one of the last remaining institu tions of the Western world to preserve and practice traditional forms. Understanding the term s initiation, rite, and tradition is essential to every Mason’s development. INITIATION While having a number of meanings and possible in terpretations, initiation is foremost a spiritual undertaking. To be initia ted into Masonry, particularly in mo dern times, is a highly significant and meaningful step in one’s life. In a wo rld too often governed by busy schedules, loose tongues, and the accumulation of wealth, Masonry helps provide balance by teaching the values of stillness, silence, and selflessness. The term “initiation” comes from the Latin word initiare , which is a late Hellenistic translation of the Greek verb myein . The main Greek term for initiation, myesis , is also derived from the verb myein , which means “to close.” It referred to the closing of the eyes, which was likely symbolic of entering into darkness prior to reemerging and receiving Light , and to the closing of the lips, which was a reference to the vow of silence taken by all initiates. Another Greek term for initiation was telete . On the subject of the immortality of the soul , Plutarch writes that “t he soul at the moment of death goes through the same experiences as those who are initiated into the great mysteries. The word and the act are similar: We say telentai (to die) and telestai (to be initiated).” The fact that myein means “to close” and its Latin translation, initiare , is derived from the earlier inire , which means “to go in” or “t o begin,” further suggests that a notion of endings and beginnings was inhere nt to the ancient understa nding of these terms. With this understanding, initiation is a new unde rtaking, the beginning of a new, spiritual life."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 RITE The word rite is derived from the Latin ritus , which comes from the Sanskrit ri , meaning to flow, and is usually associated with a running stream or a way. This term is closely linked by its definition with the term tradition and denotes the continuous performance or preservation of something sacred associated with the Divine. TRADITION The word tradition derives from the Latin traditus , past participle of tradere , meaning to give or deliver into the hands of another, to entrust. This word also has I ndo-European roots coming from trans , meaning to give. With this understanding, tr adition is transmission. It is the handing down of knowledge and far mo re than mere repetition. Tradition is that which has kept its original character and retains it s transcendent aspect. Freemasons are concerned with that part of tradi tion that is most inward and elevated, and thus, what constitutes its very spirit and essence. Tradition also means permanence in what is essential and integrity of principles. One of the Anci ent Charges of Freemasonry, repeated at the installation ceremonies of many juri sdictions, including ours, states that “You admit that it is not in the power of any man, or body of men, to make innovations in the body of Masonry.” For to make innovations may break the transmission. The Masonic Secret Ineffable and incommunicable. While Freemasonry is an association that has ru les, regulations, archiv es, and minutes, only the direct and oral transmission can communicate the spiritual influence which is the fundamental purpose of every initiatic organi zation. An uninitiated person w ho knew all the rites from having read their descriptions in books would still not be initiated in any way, for the spiritual influence inherent in those rites would in no way have been transmitted to him. Since the Masonic secret is of such a nature that words cannot express it, initiatic teaching can only use rites and symbols that suggest rather than express. The interior wo rk of the individual, using the symbols as base and support, will allow each initiate to attain that secret and pene trate it more or less completely, more or less profoundly, according to the measure of his own possibilities of comprehension and realization. In making his journey through Masonry, the initiate learns that the traditional forms used by an initiatic organization are fundament ally something other than how they appear from the outside, and this is what essentiall y distinguishes them from profane forms, where the outward appearance is everything and does not c onceal any reality of another order. One consequence of this difference is that secret s of an exterior order can always be betrayed, whereas the initiatic secret can never be betrayed since it is inaccessible to and ungraspable by the uninitiated and therefore cannot be penetr ated, since knowledge of it can only be the consequence of initiation itself."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 Since this secret is of such a nature that word s cannot express it, initia tic teaching can only use rites and symbols that suggest rather than expr ess. Properly speaking, what is transmitted by the initiatic rite is not the secret itself, since this is incommunicable, but the spiritual influence that stimulates the initiate’s inner process of discovery. Symbolism The expression of relationships. Symbolism in its most basic sense means using on e thing to represent anot her. Words, signs, and gestures are all forms of symbols. Freemasons, however, study symbolism in a deeper sense. The term symbolism is derived from the Greek symbolon , which was a token of identity verified by comparing with its other half. In this sense, symbols are the representa tion or affirmation of a concept or truth by reason of relationship or unity of parts. The meaning represented by the symbol is actually greater th an the whole of its parts. Freemasons are concerned with this aspect of sym bolism, the gathering of what is scattered, as a means of better understanding the whole of existen ce. By gathering knowledge from the spiritual traditions of the world and uniting good men who otherwise would have stood apart, Freemasonry serves as the center of union in the Mason’s quest for the tr uth. Benefiting from the meanings and truth we find hidden within sy mbols requires synthesi s, association, and application. Each symbol, when properly percei ved by the knowing initia te, reflects the inner relationship between the material and spiritual wo rld and thereby reveals the reality of a higher order. Seriously studying symbolism is an important aspect of growing in Freemasonry. Freemasonry makes extensive use of symbolism and allegory. Research into the historical uses and meanings of symbols utilized in the ritu als, as well as a comp arative study of mythology, provides a strong foundation for Masonic knowledge. Also recomme nded to Masonic researchers is a working knowledge of the contents of the Bi ble. Whenever a person or event is explicitly mentioned or alluded to in the rituals of Masonry, it may be important to find out why. In Masonry, the lodge is the cen ter of activity. It represents the Temple of Solomon and all degree work (ritual) and advancemen t is done within the Temple. The Temple is considered to be an exact replica of the Divine wo rld. It is sacred; it is the center of the universe. Its structure, furnishings, dimensions, and proportions—its arch itecture—are a mirror image of the Divine. It is sacred space, reflecting a higher order. Th e Temple is the place wh ere the human is most likely to encounter the Divine. The Temple of Solomon was built on a giant st one in Jerusalem which, according to Jewish tradition, is the center of the unive rse. The importance of stones is pervasive in religious thought. References connecting stones with the gods reach back to the earliest times. It has been considered by some religious historians as being an archetypal image representing absolute reality. Many of the old gods, such as Mith ras, were thought to be born from stones ( petra genitrix ). Stones possess the qualities of stability, solidity, and everlastingness, which are also qualities attributed to the gods. There are numer ous references to stones throughout the Bible which allude to a link between the stone, the sacr ed, and spirituality. In Isaiah 28:16 we read: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I la y in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a su re foundation.” In Psalm 118:22 we find: “The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of th e corner.” Also, in Reve lation 2:17 we read: “To"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.” Expectations Some things to consider about Freemasonry and personal responsibility. If the purpose of Freemasonry is “to make good men better,” men should become Freemasons only if they are good and consider themselves capable of becoming better. Determining the qualifications of men seeking admission is an es sential aspect of upholdi ng the integrity of our ancient institution. The investig ative procedures of lodges are designed to ensure that the Brethren of the lodge have sufficient in formation about the candidates they vote on. Ritual is intended to be performed in a so lemn manner to provide the most meaningful experience possible for the candidates and the me mbership. Creating an atmosphere that may lead to a positive transformation of the individual is the goal of Masonic ritual. Time between degrees should be used for intellectual study, contemplation, and self- development. Candidates should demonstrat e some degree of improvement in their understanding of Freemasonry before being advanced to the next degree. When this is properly observed, every Mason grows into a better man a nd the bonds of virtue th at tie together the brotherhood of human ity are strengthened. It is intended that lodges provi de their candidates with instru ction about the teachings and symbols of Freemasonry. Qualified Masons ar e always encouraged to provide Masonic instruction to their Brethren in the form of presentations, answering questions, and promoting discussion. The focus of the Mason’s intellect ual and philosophical development should be on applying the teachings of Freemasonry in his daily life. Freemasonry helps teach the importance and benefits of duty and service. If every Mason works hard and takes responsibility in all he does, then Masonry will thrive. Masons are expected to attend all meetings of their lodge, and if unable to do so, inform a brother or the Secretary of the lodge of the reason in advance. Officers of a Masonic lodge serve in their offices as a privilege and not as a right. It is intended that brothers attain positions of responsibility only after havi ng demonstrated their good faith, ability to make a serious time commitment, and si ncere desire to correctly perform the necessary duties. The election of the Master is always of importance, and only th ose Brethren should be considered for this honor and responsibility who are well versed in Masonic teachings, who have the resourcefulness to lead, and whose persona l character can serve as an example to be followed."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 Becoming a Mason QUALIFICATIONS OF A PETITIONER The qualifications to be a Mason are clear and distinct. There ar e physical, moral, and spiritual qualifications. In California, the petitioner must be a man of at least 18 years of age. He must be free of any previous felonious cr iminal convictions and be of good moral character. He must also believe in a Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul. The physical qualifications are necessary because the person must be free to make his own life decisions and be responsible for himself. The moral qualifications are self-evident for the viabili ty of any brotherhood and the lofty ideals of our society. The spiritual qualifi cations support the structure of Freemasonry and affirm its consistency with the great Myst ery Schools and religi ons of the world. THE SECRET BALLOT After a man has applied for Masonic member ship, and his background has been thoroughly investigated, the lodge members vote by secret ball ot to accept or to reje ct him for membership. Masonry’s secret ballot is another of its ancient customs. It ha s been rather aptly said that when a petitioner is voted upon for Masonic membershi p, he undergoes the “Ordeal of the Secret Ballot.” To be elected, he must receive an affi rmative vote from each and every member present at that meeting. The Entered Apprentice Degree PREPARATION FOR INITIATION If a man senses the stirrings in his heart for a deeper understanding of life than that he has heretofore found, he will seek until he finds the fraternity. This longing of the heart is the beginning of his initiation, which is why each candi date who comes seeking Light is said to be first prepared in his heart. While Freemasonry is not a religion, its rites ar e of a serious nature, dignified in their presentation, and which impart teachings that, if properly understood, obligate a man to lead a better life. To get the greatest goo d from the rites, a candidate should prepare his mind and heart to understand and absorb the teac hings of Masonry. The candidate should pay close attention to every part of the ritual. The forms of the rituals may be new and unusual to the candidate, but such forms have always been pa rt of the initiatic traditions of the world. DULY AND TRULY PREPARED Being duly and truly prep ared refers to being divested of all minerals an d metals to emphasize the concern with a man’s internal qualifications, rather than his worldly wealth and honors. By undergoing the special preparation, the candidate signifies the sin cerity of his intentions. Being duly and truly prepared also refe rs to the state of a man’s hear t and soul as he seeks admission into our Order. “Seek and ye shall find. Ask and it shall be given unto you. Knock and it shall be opened unto you.”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 THE HOODWINK The symbolism of the hoodwink is twofold: First, it emphasizes the veil of secrecy and silence surrounding the mysteries of Freemasonry; secon d, it represents the mystical darkness, or ignorance, of the uninitiated. It is removed at the appropr iate time, that is, when the candidate is in the proper state to receive Light. THE CABLE-TOW The cable-tow is a rope such as would be used to tow or restrain. It is also generally regarded as a symbol of the voluntary and complete accepta nce of, and pledged comp liance with, whatever Masonry may have in store. The cable-tow is also symbolic of the candidate’s attachment to the outside world. The length of the cable-tow is frequently refe rred to in the language of Freemasonry, but many of the new Brethren do not understand its meaning. Formerly, a cable-tow was deemed to be the distance one could travel in an hour, which was assumed to be about three miles. In Masonry, this is any reasonable distance from which a summons may be answered, health, family, and business permitting. Each Mason is bound to all other Masons by a tie as long and as strong as he himself determines his ability will permit. One may also consider the idea of the silver cord (Ecclesiastes 12:6) as the cable-tow. ENTERING THE LODGE As an Entered Apprentice takes his first step into the lodge room, he enters into a new world: the world of Masonry. He leaves the darkness, destit ution, and helplessness of the world for the light and warmth of this new existence. It is not an idle formality, but a genuine experience, the beginning of a new life in which duties, rights, and privileges are real. Entr ance into the lodge is symbolic of the movement from the outer to the i nner, from the world of material senses into the world of his true self. If a candidate is not to be an Apprentice in name only, he must stand ready to do the work upon his own nature that will make him a different man. Freemasonry o ffers no privileges or rewards except to those who earn them; it places working tools, not playthings, in the hands of its members. To become a Mason is a solemn and se rious undertaking. Once the step is taken, it will change the course of a man’s life for the better. THE METHOD OF RECEPTION The reception of the candidate into the lodge room is intended to symbolize the fact that our rituals are serious and confidentia l and that there are consequences for violating this confidence. It also reminds a man that his every act has a cons equence, either in the form of a reward or a penalty. The method of reception also points out th e value of a certain virtue needed to gain admission into the mysteries of Masonry."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 PRAYER IN LODGE A lodge cannot be opened or closed without prayer, which is offe red by the Master or Chaplain. The prayer is universal in na ture, and not peculiar to any on e religion or faith. The act of invoking the blessings of Deity, how ever, is a central Masonic prac tice. At the end of prayer, each member responds with the words “So Mote It Be,” which is an older phrase meaning “So may it ever be.” THE PRACTICE OF CIRCUMAMBULATION Circumambulation means to walk around some centr al point or object. In Masonry, the act is performed in a clockwise manner, patterned after the movement of the sun as it is seen from the earth, moving from east to west, by way of the south. The candidate’s journey around the altar also enables the Brethren to observe that he is properly prepared. Circumambulation is an ancient practice found all over the world. Much the same idea as the labyrinth, it portrays the path of initiation as that of a journey. In another sense, it symbolically aligns one to a proper relationship with the order of the universe by outlining the circ umference of one’s life to direct attention to the spiritual at the center. KNEELING AT THE ALTAR The central piece of furniture in the lodge is the a ltar. The altar is symbol ic of many things. As a temple symbolizes the presence of Deity, the altar symbolizes the poi nt of contact. Its location, in the center of the lodge, also symbolizes the place which God has in Masonry, and which He should have in every person’s li fe. It is also a symbol of worship and faith. The candidate approaches the altar in search of Light and also assumes his Obligations th ere. In the presence of God and his Brethren, he offers himself to the se rvice of the Supreme Architect of the Universe and to mankind in general. The altar is the po int on which life in our Masonic lodges is focused, and it should be accorded the highest respect. The wisdom of the Master is said to flow from his station in the east to the altar. Thus, one should never cross between the Master’s stat ion and the altar when a lodge is convened. THE OBLIGATION The Obligation is the heart of the degree; fo r when it is assumed by the candidate, he has solemnly bound himself to Freemasonry and assumed certain duties which are his for the rest of his life. The taking of the Obligation is visible and audible evidence of the candidate’s sincerity of purpose. In addition to bindi ng the candidate to Freemasonry and its duties, the Obligation also protects the fraternity against someone revealing the modes of recognition and symbolic instruction. Like much in the fraternity, the roots of th is practice are ancient. Making vows was a common practice in the Ancient Mysterie s and was even a form of pe rsonal religion to the general populace. In many ways, the vow defined their rela tionship with the deities of their homeland. Many vows were expressed in terms such as prom ises to a deity in return for safe voyages, successful crops, healing, and so on. Although the nature of making vows and Obligations has changed in modern times, it remains a very power ful method for setting direction in one’s life and the building of character. The Latin obligato literally signifies a tying or binding. The"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 relationship between the cable-tow and the Obligation, along with the changing natu re of this relationship as the candidate pr ogresses, should not go unnoticed. The ancient symbolic penalties are retained in our ritual to impress upon the mind of each brother how seriously a violation will be regarded by members of the fraternity. The Obligations were voluntarily assumed, and every means possible is used to impress the new Mason with their solemnity and the necessity of performing them faithfully. THE THREE GREAT LIGHTS OF MASONRY The Three Great Lights of Masonry are the Holy Bi ble, square, and compass. The Volume of the Sacred Law (VSL) is an indispensable part of the furniture of a lodge. The Grand Lodges of the United States use the Holy Bible as the VSL on th eir altars. In our jurisdiction, a candidate may request to have his own sacred book present on the altar with the Bible during his degree ceremonies. In some lodges in other countries, othe r sacred texts are placed on the altar in place of the Holy Bible, but no lodge in California ma y stand officially open unless the Holy Bible is opened upon its altar with the square and compas s displayed thereon. Th e open Bible signifies that we should regulate our conduct according to its teachings because it is the rule and guide of our faith and is a symbol of man’s acknowledgment of his relation to Deity. The square is a symbol of morality, truthfulness, and honesty. To “act on the square” is to act honestly. The compass signifies the propitious use of action and is a symbol of restraint, skill, and knowledge. We might also prop erly regard the compass as ex cluding beyond its circle that which is harmful or unworthy. The square and compass are recognized by the general public as the symbol of Freemasonry. The symbolism of the square and compass is seen in many ancient carvings and artworks. A stonecutter’s square has been seen to represent the earth, while the compass was related to the arc of heaven. Thus their union is symbolic of the union of heaven and earth. The VSL can also represent God’s communication to man through scripture and revelation. The VSL combined with the united square and comp ass can also be seen as representing God’s expression through the creation of heaven and earth. The Three Great Lights are also consistent with the three-tier system of Ancient Craft Masonry. One way of interpreting the triple symbolism is seeing human nature as divided into three parts—body, intellect, and soul—with a degree for each part. In the same way, The Three Great Lights can be viewed as the guidi ng principles of the three natu res: the square for the body, the compass for the intellect, and the Volume of Sacred Law for the soul. PRESENTATION OF THE LAMBSKIN APRON The apron is at once an emblem of innocence an d the badge of a Mason. By innocence is meant clean thinking and clean living, a loyal obedience to the laws of the Craft, and sincere goodwill toward one’s Brethren. The “Badge of a Mason” signifies, among other th ings, that Masons are workers and builders. The apron as a mark of distinction has been found in many similar organizations of initiatic nature including the Essenes and the Mithraic Mysteries, and has been conspicuous on statues of some Egyptian and Greek deities. The lamb has always been a symbol of innocence and sacrifice. There are two senses in which innocence is being used here. Innocence in one sense is free from moral defect. The other sense used is that of being newly born."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Another consideration of the white lambskin apro n is that the Sign of the Ram begins at the Spring Equinox—the time of year that life is renewed. The Masonic apron is made up of two parts: a square and a triangle, representing four and three, resp ectively. The symbolism of these numbers, as well as their sum, should be studied in connection with the fo rm of the apron in the different degrees. Finally, it should be mentioned that the word candidate comes from the Latin candidatus, which means “clothed in white.” THE RITE OF DESTITUTION The symbolism of the Rite of Destitution reverts to those ancient times when men believed that the planets determined human fate and controlled human passions , and that there were metals by which each planet was itself controlled. In an cient initiations, candida tes were compelled to leave all metals behind, lest they bring into th e assembly disturbing planetary influences. The candidate is not to bring into the lodge room his passions or pr ejudices, lest that harmony, which is one of the chief concerns of Masonry, be destroyed. WORKING TOOLS OF AN ENTERED APPRENTICE The working tools presented to the candidate were those used by the ancient operative craftsman in the erection of the building on which he was working. To the speculative Mason, these represent the moral habits and forces by which man shapes and reshapes himself. By these symbolic tools, he also fits his own behavi or to society and comm unity. While they do not contain the whole philosophy of Masonry, the va rious working tools a llocated to the three degrees, by their very presence, declare that ther e is constructive work to be done, and by their nature indicate the directi on this work is to take. The working tools of this degree are specified as the twenty-four-inch gauge and the common gavel. The symbolic description of these tools is provided in the ritual and the Monitor . It is interesting that one tool (gauge) is used passively and the other (g avel) is used actively. One is a tool of measurement and calculation, while the othe r is one of force. One tool decides what to keep, while the other gets rid of the rest. The three parts may also be seen to represent the tripartite nature of the soul as defined by Pl ato: the desirous, emoti onal, and mental. When properly cultivated, they embody the virtues temperance , fortitude , and prudence . These three virtues combined in proper order promote the supr eme virtue of the whole self: equilibrium, or justice. THE NORTHEAST CORNER The northeast corner is traditiona lly the place where the cornerstone (the first stone) of a building is laid. The Apprentice is thus placed, because from here he will erect his own temple by the principles of Freemasonry. The north in Masonry is attributed to darkness and the east to light . Therefore, the northeast is a place midway between darkness and light. Being mi dway, it is also symbolic of equilibrium. Furthermore, this spot representing equal light and darkness corresponds with the point of the Spring Equinox, when the length of the nighttime is e qual to the length of the daytime. There is some evidence that the lambskin apron was pr esented to the candidate at one time in the northeast corner of the l odge. It needs to be mentioned that there is a seeming contradiction of this symbolism with physical reality. If we im agine the lodge’s boundaries to be the eastern and western horizons, with the north and south walls being the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 (where the sun reaches its northern and southern limits), then the day that the sun rises in the northeast corner of the “lodge” is the Summer Solstice near St. John the Baptist’s Day. Sometimes symbolism overlaps, but in many cases, it is a hint at a deeper meaning. THE HOLY SAINTS JOHN St. John’s Day in summer (June 24) and St. John’ s Day in winter (December 27) were adopted by the Christian Church in the th ird century in a way that preser ved the pagan traditions of the summer and winter Solstices. It was the custom for the guilds of the Middle Ages to adopt sain ts as patrons and protectors, usually due to some relation to their trades. Th e operative Masons were among many guilds which adopted one Saint John or the other. According to Masonic tradition, Freemasons come from “the Lodge of the Holy Saints John of Jerusalem.” KING SOLOMON’S TEMPLE Our ritual is based upon Masoni c legends connected with both Solomon and the Temple at Jerusalem. The Biblical passage s regarding the Temple can be found in the First Book of Kings, Chapters 5 to 8, and the First Book of Chr onicles, beginning in the second chapter. In Masonry, the lodge represents the Temple of Solomon, and all degree work (ritual) and advancement is done within the Temple. The Temple is considered to be an exact replica of the Divine world. It is sacred; it is the center of the universe. Its st ructure, furnishings, dimensions, and proportions—its architecture—are a mirror image of the Divine. It is sa cred space, reflecting a higher order. The Temple is the place where th e human is most likely to encounter the Divine. The Temple of Solomon was built on a giant st one in Jerusalem which, according to Jewish tradition, is the center of the unive rse. The importance of stones is pervasive in religious thought. References connecting stones with the gods reach back to the earliest times. It has been considered by some religious historians as being an archetypal image representing absolute reality. Many of the old gods, such as Mith ras, were thought to be born from stones ( petra genitrix ). Stones possess the qualities of stability, solidity, and everlastingness, which are also qualities attributed to the gods. There are numer ous references to stones throughout the Bible which allude to a link between the stone, the sacr ed, and spirituality. In Isaiah 28:16 we read: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I la y in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a su re foundation.” In Psalm 118:22 we find: “The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of th e corner.” Also, in Reve lation 2:17 we read: “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.” "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 THE LECTURE OF THIS DEGREE The lectures given to the candidate are intended to elaborate cert ain phases of the ritual, giving a broader explanation of the cerem onies in order for the candidate to understand the lessons of Freemasonry. The Four Cardinal Virtues of Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice are explained as well as the three tenets of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. The form of a lodge is an oblong square, or a rect angle. It extends from east to west (horizon to horizon) and between north and south. The covering of the lodge is the ca nopy of heaven. It is not a coincidence that the two ma jor patrons of the Masonic lodge have their birthdays near the summer and winter solstices, where the sun reache s its most northern and southern limits. The east in a Masonic lodge does not ne cessarily mean the actual point of the compass. The east in the lodge is the station of the Wo rshipful Master whence he dispen ses Light and instruction to all his Brethren. Some lodges may actually have the Master sitting in another compass location, but the important point is that the Master is always symbolically located in the east, and the other symbolic points of the west, south and north are lo cated in proper relation to the station of the Master. Further instruction is given in the long fo rm of the lecture regard ing the “supports of the lodge,” which are The Three Pilla rs of Wisdom, Strength, and Beau ty, which also relate to the three immovable Jewels of the L odge: the Square, Plumb, and Level, which still further relate to the three principal officers: the Master, Senior Warden , and Junior Warden, and the three Lesser Lights of the Lodge. The three movable Jewels of the Lodge consist of the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the trestleboard. The Rough and Perfect Ashlars are precise symbols of the process of initiation. In an alchemical sense, the Rough Ashlar is the prima materia , while the Perfect Ashlar is the Philosopher’s Stone. The ornaments of the lodge c onsist of the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Paveme nt symbolizes the opposites encountered in the universe. All of these symbols s hould be studied further to find out what they conceal and what they reveal. THE CHARGE At the end of the ceremony and instruction in eac h degree, the candidate is charged to perform his Masonic duties. The Charge give n him explains these duties, espe cially in their relation to the particular degree. The Charges are to be take n seriously, as they out line the duties of the Freemason. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Duties and Rights of Entered Apprentices and Fellow Crafts The duties of Entered Apprentices and Fellow Crafts include the diligent study of the symbols, lessons, and history of Freemasonr y and working to satisfy the advancement requirements. Their rights are limited and de scribed by the California Masonic Code as follows: §23090. ENTERED APPRENTICES AND FELLOW CRAFTS. Entered Apprentices and Fellow Crafts have onl y the right to sit in the lodge in which they received the degree or degrees when ope n in a degree taken by them, and the right to advancement therein after satisfactorily passing a strict examination in open lodge. They may, with the consent of the Master, visit another lodge wo rking in a degree taken by them, if accompanied by a Master Mason w ho has sat with them in open lodge and vouch es for them. They are not required to pay dues and are not entitled to vote or speak in lodge. They may be buried with Masonic honors upon the requ est of their family. Neither they nor their widows or orphans are entit led to relief from the lodge. They shall not exercise any control over lodge funds for ch arity, or for other purposes. An Entered Apprentice cannot vote or hold office. He is, however, en titled to a Masonic funeral. The Entered Apprentice is not en titled to organized Masonic char ity, but this does not bar him from receiving assistance from a Mason, as an individual. He can attend a lodge while an Entered Apprentice degree is being presented. The Entered Apprentice has a right to be instructed in his work and in matters pertaining to his degree. If charged with violating hi s Obligation, he is entitled to a tr ial. He is entitled to apply for advancement to the second degree of Masonry when proficient in the En tered Apprentice degree. He may not receive the degrees of Craft Masonry elsewhere without consen t of his current lodge. Also, the Apprentice possesses modes of recogni tion by which he can make himself known to other Masons. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 Proficiency and Advancement Prior to advancement to the Fellow Craft degree , every Mason in California must be able to answer certain questions and reach a required level of proficienc y in the work of the Entered Apprentice Degree. The proficiency requirements should be explained in detail by the members of the lodge. The purpose of the requirements is to teach each candidate the language of Freemasonry, fix in his memory the teachings and structure of the degree, impress upon his consciousness the different points of the Obligation, and to teach the value of ancient methods of learning and contemplation. The questions may be answered in written fo rm, though it is highly enco uraged to read the answers in open lodge in the form of a brief presentation. I. What is initiation? Please describe in your answer some historical and symbolic aspects of initiation, what role it has played in human society, and what role you view it playing in your life. II. What symbols or aspects of the Entered Apprentice degree ritual had particular personal significance to you? Please explai n what was most meaningful to you and how you expect it to affect your life in the future. III. What do you view as the most importan t lessons in experiencing the Entered Apprentice degree? Please explain what you think the experience is meant to convey and how you benefited from it. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 Mentorship As every new Entered Apprentice needs guidanc e and assistance, most lodges will assign a learned brother to serve as his mentor. In this way, the needs of the Entered Apprentice can be met and his potential properly cultivated. The me ntor is meant to assist the Entered Apprentice with reaching the required level of proficiency an d with answering the required questions prior to advancing to the next degree. The term mentor originates from the name of a friend of Odysseus from Greek mythology, who was entrusted with the education of his son, Telemachus. A mentor , properly defined, is a trusted counselor and guide. In taking on the role of an educational institution, Masonry sets standards to which it seeks to elevate each Mason, and provides the means by which those standards can be attained. The mentor, or guide, serves as the principal facilitator of those means. The mentor’s broader role is to aid the new member in developing meaningful bonds with the fraternity in general and the brot hers of the lodge in particular . The rest of the lodge members also play an important mentoring role, and th e new Entered Apprentice should feel comfortable engaging his new brothers in conversati on and asking questions on Masonic topics. Many lodges present new members with Masonic books to help them develop an understanding of the lodge’s philosophical and intellectual in terests. The books may differ for each candidate, depending on his level of knowledge and experien ce with symbolic and ph ilosophical subjects. By assisting each candidate early on in his pursu it of knowledge and self-improvement, the lodge endeavors to develop within him a lif elong interest in Masonic Formation. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 Presentation Adapted from How to Give a Talk: Changing the Culture of Academic Speaking, by Paul N. Edwards from the University of Michigan School of Information. Rhetoric—the skill of persuasive oral argumen tation—is one of the most ancient academic disciplines, dating to Plato’s Dialogues and before. While th ere is no single method for presenting a paper or answers to the required questions (if one has chosen to provide his answers in open lodge), the following suggestions on effective communication can be helpful. Principles of Effective Speaking Any effective talk must do three things: (1) communicate your arguments and ideas, (2) persuade your audience that they are true, and (3) be interesting. USUALLY BETTER USUALLY WORSE * Talk * Read * Stand * Sit * Use visual aids: outl ines, pictures, graphs * Have no visual aids * Move * Stand still * Vary the pitch of your voice * Speak in a monotone * Speak loudly and clearly, toward the audience * Mumble, facing downward * Make eye contact with the audience * Stare at the podium * Focus on main arguments * Get lost in details * Finish your talk within the time limit * Run overtime * Rehearse your talk * Don’t practice * Summarize your main arguments at the beginning and end * Fail to provide a conclusion * Notice your audience a nd respond to their needs * Ignore audience behavior * Emulate excellent speakers * Emulate mentors regardless of their speaking ability"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 The more one understands the reasons behind thes e principles, the clearer their importance will become. Talk rather than read . You will be easier to understand, a nd you will be better able to make genuine contact with your audience. Furthermor e, talking will help you think more clearly by forcing you to communicate your points in ordinary language. There is nothing virtuous about perfect grammar, complicated sentences, and so phisticated vocabulary if your audience can’t follow you. Do not be stiff . It is easier to keep focused on so meone who’s moving than on a motionless talking head. Hand gestures are also good. It is possible to over use these devices, of course. Vary the pitch of your voice . Monotones are sleep-inducing. Sin ce it is possible to speak in a lively, animated manner without changing pitch, many people do not realize they have this problem. Get a trusted friend or colleague to listen to your delivery and give you honest feedback. (This is an important pr inciple in itself.) Even better, tape record or videotape yourself and check out how you sound. Speak loudly, clearly, and confidently . Face the audience. An important element of vocal technique is to focus on the bottom (the deepest pitch) of your vocal range, which is its loudest and most authoritative tone. Speak from the gut, not the throat. Breathe deeply—it is necessary for volume. Be careful, when usi ng visual aids, that you continue to face the audience when you speak. Make eye contact with the audience . If this is anxiety-inducing, at least pretend to do this by casting your gaze toward the back and sides of the room. Be careful not to ignore one side of the audience. Many speakers “side” uncons ciously, looking always to the le ft or to the right half, or only to the front or th e back of the room. Finish your talk within the time limit . Not to do so is disrespect ful both to any subsequent speakers and to your audience. Most people’s maximum attention span is 40–45 minutes. If you exceed this limit, you will probably lose them. Rehearse your talk to be sure of keeping within the time limit . After lots of experience, some people can gauge talk times accurately without this. But nothing is more embarrassing—for both you and your audience—than getting only halfwa y through before hitting the time limit. Summarize your talk at the beginning and again at the end . “Tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them, and tell them what you told them.” If you follow this rule, your audience is much more likely to remember your main points. Even more important, it helps you stay focused on the key ideas you’re trying to convey. Notice your audience and respond to their needs . If people seem to be falling asleep or getting restless or distracted, the problem may not be you. Is the room too hot or too cold? Too dark? Can people see you? Is the micr ophone on? Is something outside the room distracting people? Do not hesitate to stop briefly in order to solve these problems. Wh atever the case, notice what is happening and use it as feedback. If you cannot figure out why your audience is responding poorly, ask somebody later and fi x the problem next time."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 Emulate excellent speakers . The best way to become an excelle nt presenter is to watch really good, experienced speakers and model your talks on theirs. Notice not just what they say, but what they do: how they move, how they sound, how they structure their ta lks. Add those devices to your own repertoire. Of course, none of these principl es can substitute for excellent content. Nor will following them guarantee that people will agree with you! What th ey will guarantee is that your audience will understand you, will stay with you, and will remember what you have said. That is effective communication, which is, after all, the whole point. History of Freemasonry Difficulties, competing theories, and the purpose of its study. There is a difference between what is often referr ed to in the ritual as “Masonic tradition” and the actual history related to the Order. While the term “Masonic tradition” can imply many things—from the association with older initiatic rites to certain Masonic customs or practices—it is most often used to mean Masonic mythology when used in the ritual. Wh ile most societies and spiritual traditions have certain mythol ogies about their founding, these accounts and descriptions are usually impossible to prove and serve a symbolic purpose. Some of the Ancient Mystery Schools of Egypt, Gr eece, and the Near East influenced the rituals that became a part of Freemasonry. Many of thes e ancient rites were designed as tests, and admission was granted only to those who passed a nd were worthy of further instruction. Masonic rites have some of the same elements, though pr obably of a less physical nature, while still maintaining the spiritual form. There are notable points of similarity between Freemasonry and the society founded by Pythagoras and the fraternity of Hermes at Hermopolis in Egypt. There are also affinities in the Helle nistic Mystery Schools of Isis and Osiris, the Dionysian, Orphic and Eleusinian Mysteries of Greece, and the Mith raic Mysteries of ancient Rome. Other groups that carried on like traditions include the Jewish sect of the Essenes, fr om which some believe John the Baptist came; the Roman Collegia of Artific ers, an organization of builders that Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (under the Emperor Augustus) led in the first century; and the Comacine masters who flourished at the fall of the Roman Empire . The last group provides some link with the cathedral-building projects of the medieval ag es. The Masonic connection with these great schools of the past and other organizations is te nuous at best, but nevert heless, a study of them yields deep insight into the ritu als and symbolism of Freemasonry. While Freemasonry is often described as ha ving “emerged” in 1717, when four London lodges joined to form the Grand Lodge of England, its tr aditions, symbols, and lessons can be traced to pre-modern times. The academic study of the history of Freemasonry is an exciting but highly debated field. The two most prevalent Masonic or igin theories among scholars are related to the Knights Templar, a medieval order establishe d during the Crusades, and operative masonic guilds of the Middle Ages. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 The theory that the Freemasons are direct de scendants of the Knights Templar, while highly controversial, has maintained a continuous presence in Masonic scholarship, in no small part due to the recent popularity of books re presenting this view. Th is theory holds that after their suppression by the King of France a nd the Catholic Church in 1307, the Knights Templar transferred their wealth and power base to Scotland, where the Church could not reach them, and with time and various developmen ts evolved into what we know today as Freemasonry. The theory that speculative Freemasonry, as it is known, emerged from the operative masonic guilds that built the cathedrals of the Middle Ages is the one currently accepted by the majority of scholars. According to this school of t hought, the operative masonic lodges began to accept members of the aristocracy during the Renaissan ce as “accepted,” and not operative, masons as civil society developed. However, many of this theory’s previously held assumptions are now being re-evaluated in light of a debate about the process of the so-called acception, and whether this wa s an aspect of operative and not speculative Masonry, and whethe r the emergence of speculative Freemasonry was more a question of evolution or creation. While it is possible that the truth may contain elem ents of both theories an d others, what is clear is that the individuals who were active in sh aping speculative Freemasonry perceived it as an initiatic institution through which men could de velop their moral and ph ilosophical potential. Closely investigating the lives of the founders reveals their extens ive connections to older secret societies and traditions that no doubt influenced their perception of the role of the Masonic Order. In general, there are many problems associated w ith studying the Order’s history, but the secrecy of the initiatic tradition and the difficulty of inte rpreting available evidence has likely played the largest role in keeping mainstream scholars largely unaware of, and often uninterested in, Freemasonry. Persecution of Freemasonry by total itarian governments has also made Masonic organizations in many countries seek to maintain a private existence with a minimum amount of exposure. Speculative Freemasonry has a foundation that consists of more than Protestant Christianity, and the meaning and value of the deliberate presence of other traditions in the Craft needs to be taken into account. The courtly philos ophical climate of si xteenth- and seventee nth-century Britain, even where it followed only Puritan or Ang lican trends, was strongly influenced by the underground tradition sometimes referred to as Arcadia, which encompassed within its philosophy elements of Gnostic, Neo-Platon ic, Hermetic, and Kabbalistic thought. As Rosicrucianism surfaced in the early seventeent h century, it also showed an affinity to the Arcadian stream of thought."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 The main characteristic of Arcad ianism was the renewal of intere st in the thinking and literature of the pre-Christian world. Various pagan and G nostic traditions that had survived through the Middle Ages received a certain sense of renewed credibility and promise in the eyes of their adherents, as Renaissance thinking began to pl ace greater importance on them. In understanding the streams of thought culminating in Arcadian tr aditions, it is necessary to look before the Renaissance. Kabbalistic thought, for example, had gained recognizable form among certain groups in the thirteenth century, well before Petr arch and the later Italia n translations of the Hermetic texts. Throughout the thirteenth and fourte enth centuries, the Scholastics, a group that Thomas Aquinas belonged to, had spent great effo rt interpreting classical Greek texts from Arabic sources and including them in the literature of the Christian tradition. Equall y, one need only to consult the history and plight of the so-cal led “ABC’s of Heresy” (the Albige nsians, Bogomils, and Cathars) to see that pagan and Gnostic influence of the early heretical Christian and Manichean movements had survived in Europe long afte r the Roman Empire co llapsed. It was this combination of existing traditions (or remnants of them), the rediscovery of older traditions, and the renewed interest in their origins and philosophies that shaped the circumstances in which speculative Freemasonry was formed. Scottish historian Dr. David Stevenson, in his well-researched book The First Freemasons , maintains that the evidence “ind icates that the emergence of Freemasonry involved an act of creation, not just evolution.” By noting the key influence of William Schaw and his interest in Hermeticism and the Art of Memory, Stevenson pa ints a larger picture of how in the years “around 1600 the legacy of the Mi ddle Ages was remodeled and combined with Renaissance themes and obsessions to create a new movement.” A close study of the broad range of philosophical literary works produced during this period in Europe reveals a distinct current of sym bolism embedded inside seemingly mainstream publications. To those well versed in Masonic symbolism, the cen tral themes of the initiatic tradition become quickly evident upo n examination of this literature . It was precisely out of this philosophical climate, united through organizatio ns such as the Royal Society, and through extensive correspondence that is now well docum ented, that the most well-known proponents of seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Freemasonry emerged. They were men such as Sir Robert Moray, El ias Ashmole, Jean Desaguliers, James Anderson, and their numerous friends and counterparts from all across Europe. Even if some of their writings regarding the history of the Craft may appear questionabl e in light of the evidence now available, it is clear that they viewed speculative Masonry as a cust odian of the initiatic traditions of the past, charged with th eir propagation and preservation. While studying the history of Fr eemasonry may appear difficult and to require an extensive, in- depth knowledge of some of the most complex and least understood aspect s of world history, it is a worthwhile and highly rewarding endea vor. Developing one’s knowle dge and understanding of Masonry, even if one small step at a time, is actually developi ng one’s understanding of human history as a whole and its spiritual na ture. The more one learns about the profound influence that Freemasonry has had on the developm ent of world events, the more one begins to appreciate its presence and want s to learn more. Every Freemason is a philosopher and student of life."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 History of the Grand Lodge of California During the Gold Rush of 1849, thousands of settle rs came to California in search of fortune. Those who were Masons brought their rich trad itions with them, soon establishing some of California’s first Masonic lodges in the mining towns of the Gold Country. In 1850—the same year that California became a state—the Gr and Lodge of California was established in Sacramento. Today, the Grand Lodge of Calif ornia has more than 70,000 members and over 300 lodges located throughout the st ate, making it one of the larg est Grand Lodges in the world. The history of the Grand Lodge of California is inseparable from the history of the State of California. Those same brave pioneers who came west in search of wealth, fame, and opportunity came to bring their belo ved fraternity, and all that it entails, with them. In some cases, bringing Masonry to “The New Frontier” was their primary purpose. Grand Masters of eastern jurisdictions issued char ters to western-bound sojourners, giving them the right to work as lodges in the Wild West, under the jurisdic tion of the Eastern Grand Lodge. Other Grand Masters issued dispensations, gi ving groups of Masons who found themselves in this Masonic Wilderness the right to meet and or ganize as Californi a Masonic lodges. In 1848, gold was discovered near Sutter’s Mi ll. Word quickly moved eastward, and men accordingly began to move west. Such a long, diff icult, and dangerous journey is not to be undertaken lightly, or alone. Men seeking thei r fortunes knew that to go it alone was an invitation to disaster. Accordingl y, they banded together into trav eling parties, and sought ways to fulfill the need for fraternalism and mutual assistance. Some had long been Masons, others joined Masonic lodges prior to the journey or along the way, a nd together, as Brethren, they made their way west. It is unsurprising, therefore, that many prominen t leaders in this new frontier were members of our fraternity. With the number of Masons, and the prominence th e Craft played in their lives and the lives of others, the obvious action was to create a Grand Lodge of Masons in California as soon as the possibility arose. In April of 1850, Masons in California attempted to form a Grand Lodge. Invitations were issued to all the Masonic lodges and a ll past Grand Lodge officers of ot her jurisdictions known to be in California, to send delegates to a convention. At this convention, a new Grand Lodge was to be formed. On April 17th, 1850, in Sacramento, three chartered lodges presented credentials, and three lodges under dispensation sent delegates. The oldest recorded California lodge is California Lodge No. 1, which was chartered by the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia as Ca lifornia Lodge No. 13. The vault of Western Star Lodge No. 2, in Shasta, California, contains many valuable relics, memori alizing its move from Benton City, near Chico, in 1851. The Grand L odge of Connecticut issued a charter to Connecticut Lodge No. 76 on January 31, 1849. Wh en the Grand Lodge of California was formed in 1850, it became Tehama Lodge No. 3. The Grand Lodge of California, in April of 1850, therefore consisted of three chartered lodges. Total membership in those lodges was 103. In add ition to lodges chartered by other jurisdictions, there were 11 dispensations issued by Gra nd Masters from eastern jurisdictions. A few eventually became chartered lodges. Others thri ved for a time and then faded away, and some never developed at all."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 Many of the original dispensations were issued to traveling lodges, groups of Masons headed west. These early California Mas ons would hold meetings when and where they could, and some held together long enough to take hold in a Ca lifornia community. The Grand Master of Indiana issued a dispensation to form Sierra Neva da Lodge, in Grass Valley, in 1848. The lodge eventually failed, but its members later formed Madison Lodge, which was chartered under the Grand Lodge of California. In 1849, the Grand Mast er of Louisiana gave a grant, similar to a dispensation, to a group that eventually became the Pacific Lodge at Benicia, and later was chartered as Benicia Lodge No. 5. The lodge buildi ng they built was the firs t in California and is still standing. In it are the first jewels used by the lodge, made of tin and cut from cans of food. In the lodge room, on the altar, is another relic from 1850: their Holy Bible. Another dispensation issued by the Grand Master of Louisiana formed Davy Crockett Lodge No. 7. Ruben Clark was Master in 1851, and served the State of California as architect and builder of the State Capitol Building in Sacramento. The year 1852 saw the name changed to San Francisco Lodge No. 7, as the lodge moved from the juri sdiction of Louisiana to the Grand Lodge of California. In September of 1850, the Republic of California becam e a state in the United States of America. Five months earlier, the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge, Free and Accept ed Masons of the State of California, was formed. Jonathan D. Steven son of San Francisco became the first Grand Master. On April 19, 1850, assisted by a full corps of officers, he opened the first session of the Grand Lodge of California in form. The Grand Lodge of California quickly grew and by November of 1850, Jennings Lodge No. 4 in Sacramento; Benicia Lodge No. 5; Sutter Lo dge No. 6 in Sacramento; Davy Crockett Lodge No. 7 in San Francisco; Tuolum ne Lodge No. 8 in Sonora; Marysville Lodge No. 9; San Jose Lodge No. 10; and Willamette Lodge No. 11 in Portland, Oregon, were chartered. The Grand Lodge of California grew to 304 Masons, nearly tripling its size in memb ers and quadrupling the number of lodges in seven months. The day following the formation of the Gra nd Lodge of California, the Grand Lodge of Wisconsin issued a charter to Lafayette Lodge No. 29 in Nevada City. While technically a breach of courtesy for one Grand Lodge to issue a charter to a lodge in the area of another jurisdiction, this was don e in all innocence. Communications a nd transportation were slower in those days and it sometimes took weeks or even m onths for information to arrive. In 1851, a fire destroyed the charter of Lafayette Lodge, and the lodge was quickly r echartered as Nevada Lodge No. 13 under the Grand Lodge of California. The year 1850 was a busy year for the Grand Master of Illinois. He issued dispensations for two lodges in California. The first, Laveley Lodge in Marysville, later becam e Marysville Lodge No. 9, and still later changed its name to Corinthi an Lodge No. 9. The sec ond Illinois lodge in California, Pacific Lodge, near Oroville, held its meetings at a place cal led Long’s Bar. Formed in 1850, it faded from the scene, and its member s were allowed to affiliate with California lodges. Grants and dispensations were also au thorized and issued by Grand Masters of New Jersey, Virginia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, an d Florida. None of these lasted very long and most never advanced beyond the traveling lodge stage."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 By 1860, two lodges had moved to the jurisdiction of Oregon, 13 had surrendered their charters, and two had lost them for cause. At that ti me, the Grand Lodge consisted of 128 lodges and 5,055 members.
