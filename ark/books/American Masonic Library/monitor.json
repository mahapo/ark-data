In 1783, Isaac Ba Costa, one of Hayes’ successors, instituted a Lodge of Perfection in the city of Charleston, S C.; and in 1788, a Grand Council of P. of Jei’usalem was estab - lished in the same p lace. These bodies still exist. In 1797, a Soy.. Chapter of Rose Croix de H—R---D—M-. was established in the city of Neii York. On the 31st day of May, 1801, the Supreme Council of the 33d degree for the U. S 0± A. was opened7 in Charleston, S C.; Ccl.

E. - Bodies of the Sublime degrees have been established in many places in the United States; but the expense attending their proper fitting up for work, and the ]abnr required from those who u4adertske to fill the offices, have prevented a general diffusion of the Rite. On many accounts, this is not to be regretted; the degrees are not calculated for every one; they can only be appreciated by Ma - sonic students, the real lovers of the arcana of Masonry; those who wish to understand the true cabala of the Order; Co such, the degrees of the Ancient said Accepted Rite are a cornu - copia, overflowing with treasures :-.--a dainty banijuet, where they can feast themselves to satiety.
