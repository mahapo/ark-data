DAUFflIN SIRSET PflInafllVLPflIA PA. r PREFACE 3 PREFACE This Ritual is based upon important historical occurrences at the time of the building of the Temple, and deals with a chapter of its history which is not treated in any other degree. In Holy Writ, (see I Kings v.) we learn that King Solomon sent to Hiram, King of Tyre, asking that cedar trees might be hewed out of the forest of Lebanon, for, said he, “thou knowest that there is none among us who can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.” King Hiram consented, saying, ‘amy servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there.” The scene of this Ritual is laid in the Royal Court of Tyre of Sidon, and, in a manner, portrays the means by which the workers of Sidonia were gathered together for labor in the forests of Lebanon. Although it is not a historical fact, we may readily believe that the hewers of wood in Lebanon were bound together in fraternal brotherhood, as well as the hewers of stone at Jerusalem. The Supreme Preceptor, is by law, the official exponent of the Work and the Ritual of the Order. Any doubt as to the meaning or proper working of the Ritual should be referred to him. It is a part of his duty to assist in the proper working of the Ritual, and especially to give correctly the Secret Work."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"4 COSTUMES COSTUMES N The Supreme Forest has not yet prescribed exact patterns of costumes to be used, but it is abso-. lutely impossible to properly work the ceremonies of the Royal Court without them. These costumes may be as gorgeous and elab - orate as the finances of the Forest will permit, but a really crec~itable outfit can be purchased for a reasonable sum. They may be hired from any good costumer, but it is recommended that every Forest procure a set of at least five as permanent property. The costumes should be of the Biblical Period, and under no circumstances should the costumes of a later date be used. The cloaks should be long enough to come to the ankles. The use of a gray wig, and long full gray beard for the King; white wig and short white beard for the Chamberlain; blond and dark wigs for the Princes; a crown for the King, and small crowns or bands for the others, together with hose and sandals for all, adds much to the dignity of the ceremony. The Heralds, Attendants, Trumpeters and others may be in cos - tume, and the whole ceremony of the ~oyal Court may be made as spectacular as desired. The King carries a sceptre and the Chamberlain a staff. OPENING 5 OPENING GRAND TALL CEDAR: (one rap) We are about to open Forest, No.—, of Tall Cedars of Lebanon.

GUIDE: They are well known to me and to many of the brethren. GRAND TALL CEDAR: Are they skilled in any craft? GUIDE: They are skilled wood carvers, master workmen, but hearing of the need for more hewers of timber, they have offered themselves for that service. GRAND TALL CEDAR: Workmen, you are welcome, for there is great need for more hewers in the forest. From Holy Writ, and from our previous teachings, w~ learn that at the building of the Temple, King Solomon sent to King Hiram of Tyre desiring that the Sidonians might hew cedars of Lebanon for use in the Temple. These timbers were hewed in the forest, brought down to the sea, conveyed in floats to Joppa, and thence overland to Jerusalem. A Fraternal Brotherhood existed at that time among the hewers of timber in the forest of Lebanon, as well as among the hewers of stone in the quarries at Jerusalem. The Hewers’ Fraternity was known as the TALL CEDARS OF LEBANON. It was instituted by a royal decree in the days of King Amaram, so that the workers in Leb - anon should live and work together in har - mony and brotherly love. To this Fraternity only, were imparted the secrets of the Forest. Do you desire to learn these secrets? CANDIDATES: I do. GRAND TALL CEDAR: Are you will - ing to bind yourself to us by a solemn and lasting Obligation? CANDIDATES: I am.

In places where it is convenient, the lights may be turned off, except the lights upon the altar, which should be red or green. If the whole altar is not made of cedar wood, there should be at least, some pieces of rough cedar laid upon it, or green boughs of cedar.)

The orig - inal meaning of the word “CEDAR” is, “firmly rooted and strong tree.” So may you ever be firmly rooted and strong in your love for our Order.

You will now be instructed in the Secret Work. The sign of a Tall Cedar is This is called the Hewing Sign, and is symbolic of your labor as a Hewer of wood in Lebanon. On entering or retiring from a Forest, when in session, you will advance to the center of the Forest and throw this sign to the Grand Tall Cedar, who will answer it in this man - ner, thus signifying that everything that goes on in the Forest is to be kept under cover. The Pass-word is The Test is The Grip is made thus The Sign of Welcome to the Supreme Officers is made by throwing the Hewing Sign three times, and saying in a loud voice “Welcome” with each Sign. The Response to the Invocation is, “May it ever be thus.” r INITIATION Short Form 15 GRAND TALL CEDAR: You will receive the Card of the current year from the Scribe, without which you will not be able to gain admittance to this or any other Forest. Your Pyramid should always be worn at the meetings of the Forest, and at such other times as requested by the Grand Tall Cedar. You are now duly obligated Tall Cedars, but before you can learn the skill to hew tim - ber, it ~w ill be necessary for you to receive further instructions, and be obligated as Sidonians. We are told in Holy Writ, that “there is none among us who can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians,” and only to duly obligated Tall Cedars may their secrets be imparted. These secrets will be given you in the Sidonian Degree which is to follow. It teaches that the real spirit of Tall Cedarism is the spirit of mirth and enjoyment. A reg - ular Cedar is a gentleman, a credit to society, and to our Order. He scatters sunshine, dis - pels gloom, spreads good cheer, is full of joy and laughter. Fun, Frolic, and Fellowship are the three great teachings of this Degree. Let your Fun be always clean and harmless: your Frolics full of innocent merriment: your Fellowship sincere in its friendliness and sociability. Thus will you prove that you have caught the true spirit of Tall Cedarism, and that you are a good Friend, a good Brother, and a good Sidonian. r 14 / INITIATION (After the Secret Work is concluded.)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Short Form (A list of those who are to take the stunts shall be prepared in advance, and given to the Grand Tall Cedar.)

GRAND TALL CEDAR: Tall Cedars,, you have been signally honored in being the chosen ones upon whom will be exemplified the striking ceremonies of the Sidonian degree. / (A very amusing feature may be intro - duced here by the Grand Tall Cedar reading fake telegrams and letters, referring to the selected ones, before him. These letters pur - port to come from wives and friends, and are full of harmless, but funny personal allusions, such as boasts they have made that they are not afraid, and that they hope they will get their money’s worth, talking in their sleep, etc., etc.) You will now retire to the ante room, and be prepared for the honors that await you. The other newly-made Cedars will remain standing as they are, and strictly do as they are told.

After they have left, the candidates remaining in the Forest shall. immediately be arranged in a rectangular body in the center of the Forest, leaving suffi - cient space on all sides for the procession at the beginning of the Sidonian degree. They shall be hoodwinked as soon as they are placed in position, the object being to mystify them, and keep them guessing as to what is going on, and what is going to be done to them. As the candidates are hoodwinked,, they should be carefully instructed that they are to answer, “YOU BET” in a LOUD voice to all the questions asked them by the Grand Tall Cedar. This answer should be given by the candidates alone. Rangers and members should keep silent. At the Sidonian obligation, the candidates shall be moved forward and massed near the front, leaving sufficient room for the Rangers to do their work on the selected ones. ALL CANDIDATES MUST TAKE THE SIDONIAN OBLIGATION UP TO THE FINAL CLAUSE, when the hoodwinks may be raised on all except the selected ~ones. The altar of cedar wood may be removed in order to make more room for the floor work. If an exhibition drill is to be given by the Rangers, the candidates may be seated in the Forest at the conclusion of the Secret Work.

But strict care should be taken that nothing indecent or obscene be introduced. There is abundant opportunity for clean, wholesome fun, without descending to coarse - ness and vulgarity. Tall Cedarism stands for hearty recreation and genuine diversion of a wholesome character that leaves no nasty taste. While it is true that some of our proceedings are rather uproar - ious, and could hardly be called dignified, yet we should always keep within such bounds that we need not be ashamed to ask any member of the Fraternity to become a Tall Cedar, because we are afraid he would be offended by the coarseness of the work. The selected ones should be dressed in gro - tesque garments, with funny masks, etc., being care - ful to avoid indecency and vulgarity. In the stunts, care should be taken not to be too rough and especial watchfulness should be observed in the use of the electric current. Some are physi - cally unable to stand a strong shock, and a serious accident might result which would be a great detri - ment to Tall Cedarism everywhere. Although it is neither necessary nor desirable that the Grand Tall Cedar should go upon the floor during the working of the stunts, yet he should exer - cise a strict oversight upon what is being done, and should promptly check anything which oversteps the proper bounds. While the stunts are being worked, the members should remain seated, and the floor kept absolutely clear of every one who is not actively engaged in the work. The Forest is to be carefully instructed that the members are to keep absolute silence during the playing of the slow music at the entrance of the candidates, but as soon as the lively music begins, the noise may break loose and Bedlam can reign until the candidates are halted before the Grand Tall Cedar. It is very important that the stunts should not be continued too long, or too often repeated. A short, quick, snappy succession of stunts is very funny, but the same stunts over and over become very tiresome to those looking on. Too many differ - ent stunts should not be used at one meeting. Don’t show everything you have. Save some for the next time. Simple, home-made stunts are often as suc - cessful as the elaborate and expensive ones. Aim for variety and novelty, as the members do not care to see the same old things, meeting after meeting. Above all, do not keep them going until every one is tired. Many a good meeting has been spoiled by long drills, and long stunts. Quit while they want more, and they will come back to see the rest of it. Ten minutes should be the limit for the drill, and thirty to Forty-five minutes are enough for the stunts. Longer than this is sure to be tiresome to those who are looking on."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"20 SIDON IAN DEGREE SIDONIAN DEGREE 21 SIDONIAN DEGREE (The selected ones~ must be securely hood - winked.

The Plain Form can not be properLy worked without costumes, but these need not necessarily be expensive. The King must have a robe and ci~own, but very simple robes will answer for the Princes and the Chamberlain. If a bugler or trumpeter is available, it adds much to the effectiveness of the King’s entry. In some meeting places, the only’ available dressing room for the King and Princes is back of the stage. In this event, the Forest may be called to its feet, and the Princes and King march directly from the wings upon the stage, where they will seat themselves. The bugle may be blown behind the scenes, just before the entry. It is impossible to prescribe exactly the floor movements, as the ante rooms and exits are so differentLy arranged ~in the halls.

It is not prescribed nor intended that the full ceremonies of the Royal Court shall be used at every meeting of the Forest. [n most Forests, it will be found more satisfactory and more effective, if used at only a part of the meetings, say, once, or twice, or at the most, three times in each year. Each Grand Tall Cedar is at liberty to use his own discretion as to which Form shall be used. But, if at all possible, it should be presented at least once a year in each Forest, either in Full Form, or Plain Form. It should be presented in a serious, dignified manner, and made as impressive as possible. All entrances and exits should be tyled and kept closed until the conclusion of the Secret Work. The mem - bers of the Forest should remain seated, and all unnecessary conversation and movements be avoided. The ceremonies of the Royal Court admit much elaboration in costumes and properties, and may be made very spectacular, especially in the entry of the King and his enthronement, and also the entry of Prince Azariah. In working the Royal Court, the great aim should be to have the different movements follow one another in immediate and rapid succession. The whole ceremony has been planned as a whole, and there should be no break in the action, at any time. If the Grand Tall Cedar is to take the part of the King, he should call some one to preside over the Forest and transact the preliminary business, while he is putting on his costume. The Princes and Rangers should be all READY TO ENTER as soon as the Royal Court is announced. Delay is ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY, if the different officers and the Chief Ranger will so STUDY THE RITUAL that they know where their parts come in. The Guide should have the candidates arranged in th~ ante room in such manner that they can be brought in immediately, when the order is given by the Grand Tall Cedar. All the movements and marching in the Royal Court should be with the greatest dignity and formality, and especially without levity or, appear - ance of haste. The directions as to the movements of the Rangers, as given in the Ritual, must be governed by local conditions, such as the size of the room, and the location of the entrances. The Grand Tall Cedar and the Chief Ranger are at liberty to make such changes as will add to the beauty and impres - At ordinary meetings, or in small Forests which siveness of the work. have not suitable costumes, or where the room is small, the Short Form may be used, but the Sidon - ian Degree should be given IN FULL at every meeting of the Forest. The stunts may be omitted at the direction of the Grand Tall Cedar, but this should be done only for weighty reason. If a Forest has no costumes or uniformed Rang - ers it may call upon some neighboring Forest. Very many of the Forests, having fully costumed Degree Teams and uniformed Rangers, will welcome an invitation to make a visitation and display their work. These friendly visitations are a most import - ant feature in the life of any Forest, and greatly help to create and maintain that fraternal feeling which is the foundation of our Order. The work of the Royal Court will be made most impressive and effective in every Forest by the insti - tution of a Degree Team, who may, or may not"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"q - Royal Court be officers of the Forest. It will generally be found that the Grand Tall Cedar has enough to do without undertaking to memorize and perform one of the parts in the Royal Court. In order to be effective, it is absolutely necessary that all the parts be mem - orized, and the work done without a book in sight. In every Forest there mayKbe found five members, possessing good voices and dramatic ability, who, with proper rehearsal together, can render the work of the Royal Court with dignity and impressiveness. This Team should continue from year to year, with only such changes as may be necessary. It will be found useful to have some understudies who can fill in when one of the members of the Team is unavoidably absent. The parts of the King and Chamberlain are the most important, and it is especially necessary that the Chamberlain be thoroughly familiar with the movements of the Ritual, as from his position on the floor, and in the ante room, he.can give direc - tions to the other members of the Team and to the Rangers. The salute in the Royal Court is made by stretching forth the right hand on a level with the shoulder, palm down, and bowing deeply. It is answered by the King stretching forth his sceptre, or by bowing his head. Always salute when address - ing the King. When one is addressed by the King he shall salute, or, if seated, shall rise and salute. When Supreme Officers, or other visitors are present, a suitable time for addresses may be found while the candidates are being prepared for the Sidonian Degree. Where the dressing room is back of the stage, the Rangers may enter and form in front of the Tbrone. Princes enter from wings, and stand right and left of Throne.

Thus will yoW’ prove that you have caught the true spirit of Tall Cedarism, and that you are a good Friend, a good Brother, and a good Sidonian.

KING: Tall Cedars, you have been sig - nally honored in being the chosen ones upon whom will be exemplified the striking cere - monies of the Sidonian degree. (A very amusing feature may be intro - duced here by the King reading fake tele - grams and letters, referring to the selected ones before him. These letters purport to come from wives and friends, and are full of Initiation Full Form 61 harmless, but funny personal allusions, such as boasts they have made that they are not afraid, and that they hope they will get their money’s worth, talking in their sleep, etc., etc.) You will now retire to the ante room, and be prepared for the honors that await you.
