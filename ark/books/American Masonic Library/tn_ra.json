The Equilateral, or Perfect Trtangle, is em - blematical of the Deity—the one living and true God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, and symbolizes~ His Unity and the Great Trinity of H~s attributes, Omnipotence, Omniscience, and Omnipresence, while the Circle represents the Universe created by Him, whose center is everywhere and whose circumference extends to the boundless realms of Eternity. The Triple Tau is a symbol of the TRUE WORD, and ts therefore the appropriate em - blem of those who discover in this degree the mystery of the Great and Sacred Name, and learn to revere God and worship Him. - b~ 9 ~ 3 OFFICERS OF A CHAPTER The following are the officers of a Royal Arch Chapter and the stations and places they occupy in the dependent Lodges: A Dependent Lodges In Chapter~,~. - R.W.M. 4~ A~ Sen tar Warden ~Scribe ~t ~ Junior Warden Treasurer Treasurei~ Secretary)~ Secretary 4 i~r~haplain ~ cThap[afn Captain of HostC41V~ ~ ~ Marshal /~Principal Sojourner~ Z~~S Senior Deacon Royal Arch Captain r.Jun [or Deacon ‘~~~f~?Master of Third Veil *~Master Overseer Master of Second Veil~~ Senk~r Overseer ~~~ 4 Master of First Vei1~~~j~K ~Junior Overseer Sentinel Tiler The gtahons a~id~ p1ac~s 0 of the v~ious offi - cers are as indicated in the diagrams.

W. M.—The Working Tools of a Mark Master Mason are the Chisel and Mallet. The Chisel morally demonstrates the advan - tages of discipline and education. The mind, like the diamond in its original state, is rude and unpolished, but as the effect of the chisel on the external coat soon presents to view the latent beauties of the diamond, so education discovers the latent virtues of the mind and draws them forth to range the large field of matter and space, to display the summit of human knowledge, our duty to God and to man. The Mallet morally teaches us to correct irregularities and to reduce man to a proper level, so that, by quiet deportment he may in the school of discipline learn to be content. What the mallet is to the workman, enlight - ed reason is to the passions. It curbs am - bition, depresses envy, moderates anger, and encourages good dispositions whence arises among good Masons that comely order “Which nothing earthly gives or can destroy, The soul’s calm sunshine, and the heartfelt joy.” (Some confusion arises in the Lodge room S D conducts candidate about six feet to the south.)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtirigargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n w.stichtingargus.n w. stichtingargus.nL w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.

(The Right Worshipful Master here explains the different signs, and the t; calls attention to his obligation to record his m, 9c., and delivers the following, which may be omitted if desired:) LECTURE My Brother, a brief explanation of the cere - monies of this degree will prove equally inter - esting and instructive. At the building of King Solomon’s Temple there were employed 80,000 Fe[low Crafts, one of whom you have this evening represented, whose custom it was, at the close of the sixth day of each week, to repair to the Temple with work for inspection. The inspectors, who were selected from among the most skill - ful craftsmen, were called Overseers,, and sta - tioned at the south, west, and east gates to receive all work brought up for the building of the Temple. To provide against faulty work, wroi=ght by unskilled craftsmen, being received, King Solomon had ordained that every craftsman shou[d select for himself a m (1-9), a copy of which should be placed upon each piece of work by him wrought so that it might be known and distinguished when presented for inspection. The w (7-8) of a workman were a p (2-4) a day, paid by the Senior Warden, who, under orders from King Solomon, required every cr4tsman entitled to w (7-8) to thrust his right hand through a latticed window, into his WORK 39 private apartment, bearing in the palm of his hand a copy of his m (1-9), and at the same time giving this t (3-3) The Senior Warden, seeing the m a t (8-7), knew that w (7-8) were due him and paid him accordingly. Without the m a t (8-7) he would be detected as an impostor, and would suffer the penalty —h h r h s o (10-9). The ceremonies of this degree were founded on the k (8-3), wrought by C. M. H. A. (1-8)4 and used in the principal a (6-3) of King Solomon’s Temple. Our traditions inform us that on a certain sixth day a young craftsman, repairing to the Temple with work for inspec - tion, found this curiously-wrought k (8-3) in the quarries, and, observing its peculiar form and beauty, substituted it for his own work. He then presented it at the south gate for in - spection. The Junior Overseer hesitated to receive it, but because or its peculiar form and permitted it to pass to the Senior Over- beauty eer, who, for similar reasons, passed it to the Master Overseer. The Master Overseer being unacquainted with the principles of the a (6-3), and observing that it was neither ob - long nor square, square work only being such as he was ordered to receive, and that it had none of the regular m (1-9) of the craft upon it, called a council or the Overseers, and they, knowing of no use to which it could be con - verted in the building of the Temple, heaved it over among the rubbish. The young craftsman then attempted to re - ceive w (7-8), but for want of this t—8-10— (gives it)—3 -3—was detected as an impostor,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"11 w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n~ w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus ni w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus ni w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl 40 MARK MASTER and had it not been for the timely interposi - tion of a Brother, would have suffered the penalty of (gives it) h. h. r. h. s. o. When the Temple was nearing completion, the Senior Warden reported to King Solomon that the craft were unable to proceed with the work because of the want of a k (8-3) belong - ing to the principal a (6-3) of the Temple. King Solomon replied that that piece of work had been assigned to G..M. H. A. (1-8), who, from his well-known punctuality, had no doubt promptly executed it. Search was or - dered, the k (8-3) found, and in due time placed in its proper position in the a (6-3). This degree was founded by Solomon, King or Israel; Hiram, King of Tyre; and H. A., and was intended not only to render it impossible for any Brother Mark Master Mason to suffer for the necessities of life when the p o h m (8-6) would obtain them, but also as a reward for industry, fidelity, and skill, and to incul - cate integrity and charity. R. W. M.—Brother Senior Deacon, you will place the Brother before the altar. (Junior Warden resumes stalion.) CHARGE My Brother, I congratulate you on having been thought worthy of being advanced to this honorable degree of Freemasonry. Per - mit me to impress it on your mind that your assiduity should ever be commensurate with your duties, which become more and more ex - tensive as you advance in Masonry. In the honorable character of Mark Master 41 WORK Mason it is more particularly your duty to let your conduct in the Lodge and among your Brethren be such as may stand the test of the Overseers’ squares; that you may not, like the unfinished and imperfect work of the negli - gent and unfaithful of former times, be re - jected and thrown aside as unfit for that spir - itual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. While such is your conduct, should misfor - ) tune assail you, should friends forsake you, should envy traduce your good name and mal - ice persecute you, yet you may have confi - dence that among Mark Master Masons you will find friends who will administer relief to your distresses and comfort to your afflictions, ever bearing in mind, as a consolation under all the frowns of fortune, and as an encour - agement to the hope for better prospects, that the stone which the builders rejected—pos - sessing merits to them unknown—became the chief stone or the Temple.

And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market-place and said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise. And about the elev - enth hour he went out and found others stand - ing idle and saith unto them: Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto him: Be - cause no man hath hired us. He saith unto them Go ye also into the vineyard, and what - soever is right that shall ye receive. So when WORE 45 even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward: Call the laborers and give F them their hire, beginning from the last unto F the first. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that They should have received more, and they likewise received every man a penny, and when they had received it, they murmured against the good man of the house, saying: These last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day. But he answered one of them and said: Friend, I do thee no wrong. Didst thou not agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is and go thy way. I will give unto this last even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do as I will with my own? Is thine eye evil because I am good? So the last shall be first and the first last, for many are called, but few are chosen~’ H. W.

How long this custom has prevailed we are unable to determine, but it is probable that, ever since the organization of the insti - tution, some peculiar mark of distinction has been always bestowed upon those who were selected to rule over the Craft. It is evident, then, that this degree was, originally, simply a degree of office, and con - ferred only on the elected Master of a Lodge. As these rulers of Masonry were supposed to be selected for their superior skill and intelli - gence, they alone were permitted to receive that consummation of Masonic Light which is contained in the Royal Arch Degree. The degree is also conferred in Royal Arch Chapters, where it succeeds the degree of Mark Master. The conferring of this degree, which has no historical connection with the rest of the degrees in the Chapter, arises from the following circumstances: Originally, when Chapters of Royal Arch Masons were under the government of Lodges, in which the de - gree was then always conferred, it was a part of the regulations that no one should receive the Royal Arch Degree unless he had pre - viously presided in the Lodge as Master. When the Chapters became independent, the regulation could not be abolished, for that would have been an innovation. The difficul - WORK 61 ty has, therefore, been obviated by making every candidate for the degree of Royal Arch a virtual Past Master before exaltation. H. W. M.—Brother Senior Deacon, you will place the Brother before the altar. (The Right worshipful Master delivers the fol - lowing.) CHARGE R. W. M.—My Brother, the degree of Past Master sheds no light upon itself. It was for - merly conferred only on Masters of Lodges, to instruct them in the duties they owed to the Lodges over which they were called to pre - slde, and likewise the duties of the Brethren to the Chair; but we, as Royal Arch Masons, confer this degree not only as a preliminary step, but also for the more important purpose of guarding against a breach of our Masonic obligations. We are all too apt to come f or- ward and kneel at our sacred altar and take upon ourselves the most solemn obligations to perform certain duties, and then behave as if we had not done so. This, my Brother, is not as it should be. It becomes your duty as a Past Master, by amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct, to convince mankind of the goodness of the in - stitution, so that, when a person is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows; to whom distress may prefer its suit; whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I 62 PAST MASTER If you have any doubt of the extent of your obligations, a daily recourse to the Scriptures of Divine Truth will set you right.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying, Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; nei - ther chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel; but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel. Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel. But the Lord said to David my Fa - ther, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart; notwithstanding, thou shalt not build the house; but thy son, which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. The Lord, therefore, hath performed his word that he hath spoken; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel, and in it I have put the Ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord that he made with the children of Israel. (The following prayer is here recited, all kneel - ing; lights are lowered:) O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth, which keepeth covenant and showeth mercy unto thy WORK 83 servants that walk before thee with all their hearts; thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast prom - ised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. Now, therefore, 0 God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying: There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel, yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me. Now, then. 0 Lord God of Israel, let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David. But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built! Have respect, therefore, to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, 0 Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee; that thine eyes may be open upon this house, day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldst put thy name there, to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place. Hearken, therefore, unto the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place; hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive. Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"~v.stichtingargus.n1 ~v.stichtingargus.n1 ~v.stichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtirigargus.nl w. stichtirigargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtirigargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n I I 84 MOST EXCELLENT MASTER Now, therefore, arise, 0 Lord God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the Ark of thy strength: let thy priests, 0 Lord God, be clothed with salvation and let thy saints re - joice in goodness. 0 Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed; remember the mercies of David thy servant.

The Right Worshipfui Master may recite as much of the following historical summary as he may desire.) HISTORICAL SUMMARY The degree of Most Excellent Master is as intimately connected with the Masters’ as the Mark Masters’ is with that of the Fellow Craft. The Masters’ Degree is intended, in its sym - bolic design, to teach the doctrine of the res - urrection of the dead and the immortality of the soul. But this corruption can only put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortal - ity by a passage through the portals of the grave. And here the degree of Most Excellent Master comes forward, with its beautiful sym - bolism, to represent the man prepared to enter upon that eventful passage. In the preceding degrees, the beauties of life have been delin - eated under various types—the virtuous crafts- WORK 85 man has been assiduously laboring to erect within his heart a spiritual temple of holiness, fit for the habitation of H[m who is the holiest of beings. If the moral precepts of the Order have been observed, stone has been placed upon stone, virtue has been added to virtue, and the duties of one day have been scrupu - lously performed, only that ~he dufies of the next day may be commenced with equal zeal. And now all is accomplished. The spiritual edifice which it was given to man to erect, that “house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,” upon the construction of which he has been engaged, day by day and hour by hour, from his first entrance into the world, has become a stately and finished building. The last arch has been bound together by the rejected, though priceless, keystone. Man’s earthly labors have been completed. The last condition of man on earth—when all his labors have been completed; when he is about to lay aside forever al[ his projects of ambition, of pleasure, or of business; to dissolve the ties which have bound him to the companions of his toil; to abandon, as useless, the implements of the world’s work; and to leave the temple of life and go forth as a wanderer on the unknown shores of eternity— this is the solemn scene which is symbolically commemorated in the impressive ceremonies of the degree of Most Excellent Master. • * “~ (2-5) alludes to the wonder and admiration expressed by those of our ancient Brethren who were permitted to view the in - terior of that magnificent edifice which King"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"(I ~v.stichtingargus.n1 ~v.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n[ w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtirigargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtirigargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.ni Ii 86 MosT EXcELLENT MASTER Solomon had erected, but more, especially to the admiration and astonishment of those who beheld the sublime manifestations of the Su - preme Being at the dedication of the Temple, when the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifice, and the glory of the Lord filled the Lord’s house. We have imitated our ancient Brethren in assembling on that occasion, repairing to the place designated, and participating in these solemn ceremonies. We have imitated them in gathering around the altar, engaging in prayer, and have witnessed a representation of the fire coming down from heaven, consum - ing the burnt offering and the sacrifice. We have also imitated their astonishment on be - holding it by falling down upon the ground and exclaiming, “He is good, for his mercy endureth forever.” The Temple was dedicated in the year 3001, with the most imposing and solemn ceremo - nies, to the worship of Jehovah, who conde - scended to make it the place for the special manifestation of his glory. The ceremonies lasted fourteen days, seven of which were de - voted to the dedication exclusively and seven to the Feast of the Tabernacles. Nothing ever equaled the ceremonies of its consecration. Israel sent forth her thousands, and the assembled people beheld, in solemn adoration, the vast sacrifice of Solomon ac - cepted. The flame descended upon the altar and consumed the sacrifice, the shadow and glory of The Eternal proclaimed his presence WORK 87 between the cherubim, and the voice of his thunders told to the faithful of the Craft that the perfectness of their labor was approved. As the ceremonies of this degree refer to the completion and dedication of the temple, it is reasonable to suppose that, when this magnifi - cent edifice was completed, King Solomon should bestow some distinguishing mark of his approval upon the skillful and zealous build - cis who had been engaged for seven years in its construction. No greater token of that appreciation could have been evidenced than to establish an order of merit with the hon - orable appellation of “Most Excellent Mas - ter,’ and to bestow it upon those of the crafts - men who had proved themselves to be com - plete masters of their profession. It was not conferred upon the whole body of the work - men, but was confined to the meritorious and praiseworthy—to those who through diligence and industry, had progressed far toward per - faction. You have seen the foundations of the Tem - ple laid deep and strong. You have, as an Entered Apprentice, served your Master with freedom, fervency, and zeal, and as a bearer of burdens have brought up from the quar - ries many a rough ashlar for the building. You have wrought your full time as a Fellow Craft, and, under the skillful touch of your working tools, these rough ashlars have be - come perfect ashlars—stones, we doubt not, fitted to adorn and beautify our temple.

We have now dedicated the temple to the service of the Supreme Being, and by this we are reminded that we should also dedicate our spiritual building—that temple which we have I’ been erecting within ourselves—to the service of the same Supreme Being. And although we kno\\v of a certainty that all earthly things are transient, and that m process of time, even at the best, the decay of ages will crumble our magnificent temple into dust, yet we are per - suaded that, if we, have erected the temple of our inner life by square, plumb line, and rule, its foundations shall never fail, and its fabric shall never crumble nor decay. Then let us take care that we so labor in the erection of our temple here that, when we leave this for that far distant country, whence we shall never return, we may receive the wages of faithful craftsmen. (The Right Worshipful Master explains the signs —9-10.) R. W. M.—Brother Senior Deacon, you will place the Brother before the altar. CHARGE My Brother, your admission to this degree of Masonry is proof of the good opinion the Brethren of this Lodge entertain of your Ma - sonic abilities. Let this consideration induce WORK 89 you to be careful of forfeiting, by misconduct or inattention to our rules, that esteem which has raised you to the rank which you now possess. It is one of your great duties, as a Most Excellent Master, to dispense light and truth to the less informed Mason; and I need not re - mind you of the impossibility of complying with this obligation without possessing an ~c- curate actiuaintance with the~ ritual of each degree. If you are not already completely conver - sant in all the degrees heretofore conferred upon you, remember that an indulgence, prompted by a belief that you will apply your - self with double diligence to make yourself so, has induced the Brethren to accept you. Let it, therefore, be your unremitting study to acquire such a degree of knowledge and infor - mation as shall enable you to discharge with propriety the various duties incumbent upon you, and to preserve unsullied the title now conferred upon you—that of a Most Excellent Master. You will now be seated with the Brethren. CLOSING (The same lecture should be used in closing as In the opening, with such changes in the orders as are necessary for the purpose.

Moses was faithful to the divine command, and thus became the great emancipator, prophet, leader, and judge of the children of Israel. He led his people out of bondage, through the wilderness to the border of the promised land, where on Nebo’s lonely moun - tain, his eyes undimmed by age and his nat - ural force unabated, God took him. Joshua became their leader. They entered the prom - ised land. Here they became a great nation. Mighty kings and the world’s greatest proph - ets and teachers rose among them. As long as they were faithful to God, they prospered; but when the children of Israel forgot and forsook God, national ruin came upon them. Zedeksah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord. And he also rebelled against King Nebuchad - nezzar, and stiffened h~s neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel.

Therefore, He brought upon them the King of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctu - ary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: He gave them all into his hand.

In the second section you will represent a party of the children of Israel on their return from Babylon to Jerusalem. Babylon is now under the rule of Cyrus, King of Persia, who, in this the first year of his reign, issued a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, say - ing: “Thus saith Cyrus, King of Persia, the Lord God of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He bath charged WORK 123 me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, which is in Jerusalem.” Availing themselves of this proffered liberty, Zerubbabel, with some forty and two thousand of the children of Israel and more than seven thousand serv - ants, bearing many of the holy vessels of the Temple, have departed for Jerusalem and must now be nearing that holy city.

S.—(Standing with candidates just out - side the Chapter-room)——Let us, with thank - ful, hopeful hearts, and with renewed confi - dence in the God of our fathers, who hath manifested his power and goodness, even to the heathen, in the liberation of his repentant captive children, begin our weary journey to our own native land. (Chapters using slides, see page 172.) (Commence jouxney) Through the infinite mercy of the God of our fathers, who bath put it into the heart of a heathen prince to set us at liberty, we turn our backs upon this Babel of the nations, where we have been captives, but not without hope, and are now permitted to return to the land of our nativity. The Syrian sun lights up the eastern horizon with gladness; the groves are vocal with the music of happy birds; the flowers are gaily clad in their variegated beau - ties; grateful nature rejoices in the return of spring, and even the Euphrates, as it lazily sweeps its way over the sands, seems to mur - mur praises to the Holy One, of whom the inhabitants of this bright land know nothing. We have now arrived at and are about to cross the vast ditch dug by order of King Cy - rus to drain the waters of the Euphrates so that his armies might pass under the walls of Babylon through the bed of the river. (Cross the ditch,) The work was completed—the sluicos ready. Then was seen that mysterious WORK 125 hand tracing upon the wall of the apartment occupied by the drunken Belshazzar and his beastly lords those unknown, fearful words, “Mene, mene, tekel upharsin.” Instant]y so - bered by fear, their knees smote together, for they felt in their very bones the fearful im - port of those mysterious characters. Then too there came up from the streets of the’ be: leaguered city the despairing cry “The wa - ters are drained! The waters are drained!” mingled with the sounds of rushing hosts, as the victorious Medes and Persians burst through the lofty arches. Our enemies were butchered before us, yet we, as servants of the living God, could not behold unmoved the an - guish of despairing mothers, the cries of suf - fering innocence, or the helpless agony of decrepit age (Pass East.) How incomprehensible are the dealings of our God in His visitations of wrath upon those nations that forget His law, and yet His mer - cies are equally so.

Let us be going.] Our course lies up the river until we come to the bend, where it sweeps away from the eastward, thence out upon the desert. We will be subject to many trials and privations—the want of water, the hot blasts of the simoon, and the danger of attacks from the wild rob - bers of the desert, the fierce sons of Ishmael. We are now at the bend of the river. That country on the other side is Mesopotamia, where our father Abraham sojourned. From this point until we reach old Tadmor of the wilderness, our journey will be over the hot sands of the desert, under the scorching rays of the Syrian sun, without water or a place of shade or refreshment. But a firm faith in Him who delivered our fathers from the bondage of Egypt will enable us to overcome all diffi - culties. (Cross ruins.) We are now approaching the colonnades of old Tadmor, rebuilt by King Solomon about fifteen years after the completion of the Tem - ple. The ancient site of this magnificent city was a beautifuJ oasis, surrounded by the vast and arid expanse of sand over which we have journeyed since leaving the bend of the Eu - phrates. It was built amid delightful groves r WOI~K 127 of palm and fig trees, and supplied with an abundance of pure water. Tadmor was cele - brated not only for the beauty of its situation and the grandeur of its architecture, but also as a source of great revenue to King Solomon, by reason of its vast wealth, accumulated by its immense inland commerce with the sur - rounding countries It was here that the richly laden caravans from the east unloaded their treasures in exchange for the commodities of Ihe west. But Tadmor and the noble monu-. ments of her former glory sink in the distant sands behind us, and we turn our thoughts to the next place of historical interest on our route—Riblah, memorable Rib]ah—wilh whose rums are associated events ever to be remem - bered by Israel and Judab, Eor it was here that our God visited his final judgment upon our Prince and rulers. (Pass East second time.) We are now at Riblah, and here, amid her ruins, the reminiscences of a sad past, let us pause for a season to rest our weary feet and reflect upon the former glory, the misfortunes and future destin.y of our people. (Candidates and Principal Sojourner sit upon the floor.) Looking out upon solitude and desolation, what dark memories crowd into the soul to stop the access to agreeable thought, and how vividly pass in review belore our senses those scenes of woe, which almost fifty years ago we beheld enacted even here where we medi - tate.

Though years have passed since were writ - ten those darkest pages in our country’s his - tory, yet will memory carry us back to the days of our childhood and early captivity, when here in undisputed power sat the Chal - dean, the avenging agent appointed by our forgotten God to direct the final outpouring of his wrath upon our unfortunate King and rulers. For this, you will remember, was the headquarters of Nebuchadnezzar, who was not at Jerusalem, but had remained at Riblab after defeating the King of Egypt, who, some time previous, had advanced with a large army to relieve Zedekiah. And it was here that our unfortunate King, after his capture tin the plains of Jericho, in attempting to escape from the city, was brought before the Chaldean monarch. Then lowered upon Israel’s rebellious prince that long-threatened night of divine retribu - tion, which cast its sable folds around him and forever shut out light and earthly hope, f or the Chaldean, after compelling him to witness the slaughter of his children and the lords of his household, put out his eyes and sent him in chains to Babylon, where he remained in prison until his death. Thus were fulfilled the prophecies of Ezekiel and Jeremiah, the seem - ing contradiction of which led our King to rebel against the Chaldean. And although seemingly contradictory in their import, yet how truly all came to pass as it was written. WORK 129 Jerusalem and her Temple were delivered into the hands of the despoilers, who sacked and committed them to the flames. Her King died in Babylon, yet saw it not, and through long, dreary years as he bowed his wayward people in humility before his great displeasure. But, Brethren, though cast down with sor - row by the sombre recollections of our fall which the gloom of our present surroundings so distinctly recalls, there is another prophecy even now being fulfilled, the end of which is not yet, which gives us hope in the future, for you must remember that, while the prophet foretold the destruction of Jerusalem and the degradation of her people, he also wrote that the Lord God bath said: “La, the days come that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, 0 virgin of Israel! For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God.” (Candidates are directed to rise.) How inscrutable are his ways, how infinite his mercy to his chosen people, for we, his now repentant servants, are in accordance with his promise being broughP from captivity, and under his guidance are in part fulfilling that destiny marked out by him even in the days of his wrath, when we followed after strange gods and heeded not his threats and supplica - tions.

(Cross ruins ) Here is a bridge over the Pharpar, one of the beautiful streams of Damascus. (Pass East third time and cross bridge.) From this point, except a few passes in our own glorious Lebanon, our journey will be neither difficult nor dangerous. WORK 131 Yonder lies the noble mountain! Its rugged peaks and deep gorges are rendered as soft in the blue distance as the outlines of a summer s cloud against the western sky. Hail, glorious Lebanon I Thy lofty head pierces the clouds and proudly defies the storms! Thy gloomy forests once rang with the sound of the axes and echoed the merry songs of the workmen. Thy deep gorges resounded to the crash of falling cedars, as the levies under the noble Adoniram prepared the timbers for the Tem - ple of the living God. G]orious reminiscences of 470 years of noble deeds by noble men for God-like purposes! (Between brackets may be omitted.) [Brethren, let us once more kneel and look to the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and render to him all honor and praise that, freed from bondage, we are permitted once more to gaze upon the scenes of our nativity. Prayer—0 Lord God of Israel, let us re - turn thanks unto Thee, and come before Thee singing praises to Thy Holy Name. Let Israel rejoice in Him, and let the children of Zion be joyful in their King, for He doth build up Jerusa]em Praise ye the Lord, 0 Jerusalem, and praise Him, 0 Zion.

Hear, 0 King, what the Prophet Zechariab has to say concerning thy success. (Reads.) This is the word of the Lord unto Zerub- babel, saying, not by might nor by power, but by my spirit. Who art thou, 0 great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting, crying, grace, grace unto it. Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, the hands ol Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of Hosts hath sent me unto you. For who hath despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice, and shall see the plum - met in the hand of Zerubbabel E. H. P—Brethren, what report have you to make? P. S—Excellent High Priest, King and Scribe, we repaired to the scene of our labors as directed, and wrought diligently for three days, without discovering anything of impor - tance, except passing the ruins of several col - umns of the different orders of architecture. On the fourth day we came to what we sup - posed to be an impenetrable rock. One of my companions, on striking it with a crow, ob - WORK 147 served that it returned a hollow sound, where - upon we redoubled our efforts, and on remov - ing more of the rubbish, found it to be the top of an a (6-3), from the apex of which, with much difficulty, we succeeded in raising this stone of curious form, and having en - graved upon its sides certain mysterious char - acters, Deeming this an important discovery, we have brought it up and present it to the Council for your inspection.

The original a (4-10), built by M (2-3), A (7-10), and B (3-6), was burned when the first Temple was destroyed. Of this imitation, the traditions of Masonry give the only au - thentic account. As the first a (4-10) was the symbol of the divine presence with and pro - tection of the Jewish people and pledge of the stability of their nation so long as they obeyed the commands of God, so is this copy a symbol of God’s presence with us so long as we live conformably to the precepts contained in the Book of the Law WORK 155 (The High Priest replaces all the articles within the a (4-10) eiccept the key The Royal Arch ode should be sung, all standing:) Tune: “Jesus, Lover of My Soul.” Joy, the sacred Law is found; Now the Temple stands complete; Gladly let us gather round Where the Pontiff holds his seat, Now he spreads the volume wide, Opening forth its leaves today; And the Monarch by his side Gazes on the bright display. Joy, the secret vault is found! Full the sunbeam falls within, Pointing darkly underground To the treasures we would win; They have brought it forth to light, And again it cheers the earth; All its leaves are purely bright, Shining in their newest worth. This shall be the Sacred Mark Which shall guide us to the skies, Bearing like a Holy Ark All the hearts who love to rise; This shall be the corner stone Which the builders threw away, But was found the only one Fitted for the arch’s stay.

HISTORICAL SUMMARY My Companions, having passed through the ceremonies of this degree, you must have perceived its relative importance. It is calcu - lated to impress upon our minds a fiiin belief in the being and existence of God, and it teaches a due reverence for His great and Hol~’ Name. It also brings to light some of the most important secrets of the Craft which had lain buried in darkness from the death of Grand Master Hiram Abif to the erection of the second Temple, and without which the Masonic character is not complete The de - gree of the Royal Arch is founded upon the destruction of the first and the building of the second Temple. It is merely the evolution of a truth con - tained in the early Third Degree. It is not, strictly speaking, a “higher degree,” but the last volume of the series in a sublime story revealed through symbolism The Master’s Degree without the Royal Arch is a story half told, a song unsung, and a promise unfulfilled.

To the student of Biblical and ancient his - tory, it is needless to recount the tragic events connected with, and the end of, the ten tribes of Israel, the history of which began with their revolt under Jeroboam, after the death of King Solomon. Neither is it necessary to dwell upon the history of the two remaining tribes, Judah and Benjamin, which formed the Kingdom of Judah and remained faithful in their allegiance to Rehoboam, the son of Solo - mon In the year 586 B.C. the Temple of Solomon was razed and burned to the ground by Neb - uchadnezzar, King of the Chaldeans; the faith - less Zedekiah, the last of Judah’s Kings, was made sightless and cast into a dungeon in Babylon. The holy vessels, the famous brazen pillars and all the treasures of the King’s house, of his palaces, and of his Princes, were carried away. Judah lay waste. The Temple of God was desolate. The remnants of the peo - ple, except the very poor that escaped the sword, were made captives in a foreign land Forty-eight years after the destruction of the first Temple, in the first year of his reign, Cyrus, King of Persia, issued an edict grant - ing permission to the captives to return to their own land and to rebuild the Temple of their God. He appointed Zerubbabel, a Prince of the House of Judah, Governor of the peo - ple, under whose guidance and direction the rebuilding of the Temple at Jerusalem was begun But owing to the poverty of the peo - WORK 181 pie, and the hindrance by their enemies, very litjJc was accomplished until eighteen years later, when Darius the King issued an edict that the Jews should no longer be hindered or impeded in the noble and glorious work of rebuilding the House of the Lord. I-fe also caused the sacred treasures to be sent back to Jerusalem, and, by royal command, directed that the expenses of rebuilding the Temple should be paid out of the King’s treasury. In the year 520 B.C, under the stirring ap - peals of the prophets, l-{aggai and Zecharsah, Zerubbabel again began the rebuilding of the House of the Lord. It was completed in the year 516 B.C. Thus in the period from~ the destruction of the first Temple to the comple - tion of the second Temple, we find the ful - fillment of the seventy years of captivity as foretold by Jeremiah The first Grand Council formed at Jerusa - lem for the purpose of rebuilding the Temple consisted of Zerubbabel as King, Jeshua, the son of Josedech, as the High Priest, and Hag - gal, the prophet, as Scribe. They held their meetings in the Tabernacle, which was similar in structure and color design to the one erect - ed by Moses in the wilderness This Taber - nacle was erected near the ruins of the first Temple, and guards were stationed at the en - trance to the Veils to see that none were per - mitted to enter but such as were duly qualified by being true descendants of the tribes of Ju - dah and Benjamin, and by making themselves known by the words given by God unto Moses at the 1)111 n ng bush."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl -w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus .nl ‘w. stichtingargus.n 1 ‘w. stichti ngargus.n 1 w.stichtingargus.n I ‘w. stichtingargus.n I ‘w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I ~w.stichtingargus.n I 162 ROYAL ARCH MASON In this degree you represented three of those Hebrew chptives, who, rejoicing in their new - ly found freedom, made their toilsome and weary march over rough and rugged roads from Babylon to Jerusalem; and, having prov - en worthy, you were admitted into the pres - ence of the Grand Council as three weary so - journers from Babylonian captivity, who had come hither to assist in the noble and glorious work of rebulding the city and House of the Lord, without the hope of fee or reward, where you expressed a willingness to under - take any portion of the work, however humble it might be. You began you’r labors, during whidh certain important discoveries were made, the chief of which was the long-lost Master’s Word. (The Excellent High Priest requests the class to rise, if seated, and delivers the following:) CHARGE Worthy Companions, by the consent and assistance of the members of this Chapter, you are now exalted to the sublime and honorable degree of Royal Arch Mason. The rites and mysteries developed in this degree have been handed down, through a chosen few, un - changed by time and uncontrolled by preju - dice; and we expect and trust they will be regarded by you with the same veneration and transmitted with the same scrupulous purity to your successors. No one can reflect on the ceremonies of gaining admittance into this place without be - ing forcibly struck with the important lessons Won K 163 which they teach. Here we are necessarily led to contemplate, with gratitude and admiration, the sacred source whence all earthly comforts iiiiw. 1-lere we find additional inducements to continue steadfast and immovable in the dis - charge of our respective duties; and here we are bound by the most solemn ties to promote each othcr’s welfare and correct each other’s railings, by advice, admonitions, and reproof. As it Is our earnest desire, and a duty we owe to our companions of this Order, that the ad - mission of every candidate into this Chapter should be attended by the approbation of the most scutinizing eye, we hope always to pos - sess the satisfaction of finding none among us but such as will promote, to the utmost of their power, the great end of our Institution. By paying due attention to this determina - tion, we expect you will never recommend any candidate to this Chapter whose abilities and knowledge of the preceding degrees you can - not freely vouch for, and who you do not firmly and confidently believe will fully con - form to the principles of our Order, and fulfill the obligations of a Royal Arch Mason. While such are our members, we may ex - pect to be united in one object, without luke - warmness, inattention, or neglect; that zeal, fidelity, and affection will be the distinguish - ing characteristics of our society; and that sat - isfaction, harmony, and peace may be enjoyed at our meetings which no other society can afford."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"I — w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.n~ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n 1 ‘xv. stichtingargus.n 1 ‘xv.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n1 ‘xv. stichti ngargus.n I ‘xv. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargus.n I ‘xv.stichtingargus.n I 164 ROYAL ARCH MASON E I-I.

But before leaving this beautiful and sprendid city of Babylon, let us notice the plan of the city as well as some of the public buildings, palaces, and gardens. Babylon stands in the midst of an immense plain of very deep and fertile soil. It is divided by the river Euphrates flowing diagonally from North to South. The city is enclosed with four great walls of equal length, thus forming a complete square. In each of these walls are twenty-five gates of solid brass, while within the city are fifty streets, crossing at right angles and con - necting with the gates. Within the squares thus formed are the many public buildings, palaces, and gardens which make this city one of the wonders of the world. The walls are eighty feet thick, about two hundred feet high, and ten miles long on ei - ther side, are built of sun-dried brick cement - ed with bitumen which has hardened like stone, thus leading this wicked and idolatrous people to feel secure in their pursuit of lust and lasciviousness without realizing that they are unconsciously hastening their own ruin and destruction. Scene 2. Our attention is first attracted to the celebrated Hanging Gardens, raised by King Nebuchadnezzar to give his favorite wife, Amytis, a representation of the moun - tains of her native Median country. The beautiful terraces, rising tier upon tier, cov - ered with trees, ferns, shrubs, and flowers, are held in place by ornate balustrades, supported with magnificent and exquisitely carved col - umns and chapters, while the landings and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nL w.stichtingargu s.n I w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n1 ‘w. stichtingargus.n1 ‘w. stichtingargus.n1 ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.n 1 w. stichtingargus.n 1 w. stichti ngargus .n 1 w. stichtingargus.n 1 w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n] w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichti ngargus.n I w. stichti ngargus. iii 174 stairways are surmounted with fountains, statuary, and sculptures, representing figures of winged lions and bulls, some with human heads, thus symbolizing strength, swiftness. and intelligence. Scene 3. We next behold the magnificent Temple of Belus, which many of our people suppose to be the ancient Tower of Babel, where occurred the confusion of tongues as God’s penalty for vanities and murmurings. Scene. 4. The Palace of the King next claims our attention, having long been the residence of the royal families. Within this palace were kept the Holy Vessels, brought hither when Judea was made desolate, our beautiful Temple on Mt. Zion laid in ruins, our nation despoiled, and our people led away captive by this wicked and heathen power as a righteous punishment for disobeying the commands of a kind, merciful, and just God, xvho promises forgiveness to all those who call upon Him in truth and sincerity. Scene 5. From the Palace the Holy Vessels were borne upon the shoulders of the Priests, ‘midst the sound of trumpets and the joyful acclamation of our Brethren, following the righteous proclamation of King Cyrus, an - nouncing our liberation and permission to re - turn to our own country. Scene 6. Within this Palace also occurred that memorable feast, when an armless hand wrote upon the wall the words that, translated by the good prophet Daniel, announced the downfall of the drunken Beishazzar and the loss of his kingdom. 175 Menel Mene! Tekel! Upharsin. Mene’ God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it. Tekel! Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting. Upharsin! Thy kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and the Persians. If Daniel could so fearlessly face death by thus pronouncing the doom of this besotted Prince and Ruler, how cheerfully shall we face dangers and difficulties in carrying for - ward the work of rebuilding the city and Temple of our God. Scene 7. The rich plain of Shinar, with its wonderful groves, where grew the orange, the olive, the pomegranate, the apple, pear, fig, date, and filbert, will furnish much of the dried fruit to sustain us on our long and weary journey. The trees and bushes in this wonderful grove are filled with birds of beautiful and lustrous plumage, while their sweet notes tell us of the presence of the lark, the thrush, and the linnet, and, as the shades of evening gath - er, we listen to the entrancing melodies of the nightingale or bulbul. Scene 8. Pause, my Brethren, and from this slight elevation let us take what may be our last view of the city and country which for almost fifty long years has been the home of our afflicted people. Here they were brought by Nebuchadnezzar after he had despoiled Judea and laid waste our beloved Jerusalem. Here they toiled and many ended their days, never losing faith in an ultimate release.

Scene 9. But the splendor of Babylon is the splendor of barbarism. The result of bru - tal rapine and savage conquest; filling the air with the ribald shouts of the victorious sol - diery; crushing beneath the foot of the con - querer the neck of the helpless foe; reducing to slavery and servitude those who far ex - celled them in intellectual attainments and spiritual discernment; the rearing of magnifi - cent temples, palaces, and gardens with treas - ure ruthlessly wrested from helpless enemies, even to the desecration of the Holy Vessels taken from the Temple of the Most High God! But Babylon has been kind to us, giving to an exiled race the privileges of a livelihood, of worshiping the true God, and of rearing our children in His fear and admonition. Hence, as we gaze for the last time upon her stately structures, our tears course freely for love of those who befriended us, yet would not heed God’s warning voice; for hath not the great and mighty Isaiah spoken most truly when he said: “Babylon, the glory of king- doms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. Scene 10. “It shall never be inhabited, nei - ther shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation; neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there But wild beasts of the des- 177 ert shall lie there, and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there; and satyrs &hall dance there. And the wild beasts of the island shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: And her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged~~ Oh! Baby - lon, Babylon. Farewell’ Farewell! Scene 11. We have the choice of two routes to Jerusalem. One leading almost direct, but through the deserts of Arabia. The other is up the river Euphrates, thence westward to Tadmor in the wilderness, thence by Damas - cus and then southwardly along the Jordan valley to our beloved Judea. There are dan - gers and hardships in each, but, all things con - sidered, I think the river route more desir - able. Let us pursue it. Scene 12. The recent inundation of the val - ley has brought down trees, limbs, and other obstructions and deposited them directly across our pathway. There seems to be no choice but to go over some and under those which have lodged. It is a dangerous pass, but stop’ Have we forgotten that our trust is in the Great I Am?

Scene 13. We are now journeying up the left bank of the Euphrates. How beautiful is the scenery along this famous river, skirted with reeds and the beautiful grey osier wil - lows bathing their drooping branches in its softly flowing waters! Scene 14. May this not be the spot to which the Psalmist referred when he said: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst there - of For there they that carried us away cap - tive required of us a song, and they that wast - ed us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a strange land? If I forget thee, 0 Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.” Scene 15. On the opposite side and between the rivers (Euphrates and Tigris) is the coun - try known as Chaldea. Its inhabitants are a peaceful people, engaged in tending their flocks and in the culture of the grape. In the lower part of this country, known as Ur of the Chaldees, our father Abraham was born, but by the command of God left home, friends, and kindred to become the founder of our great nation. Scene 16. We are now leaving the river and entering the Syrian Desert, which borders the 179 one we have just avoided No water any - where! How fortunate we were to have cho - sen the river route instead of the long hot journey across the great Arabian Desertl Scene 17. Oh, see the beautiful foliage in the distance! Also the lofty palm trees! It is Tadmor in the Wilderness and is a most delightful spot. Does it not remind us of Babylon? Scene 18. All this country was conquered by King David, but Tadmor was built by King Solomon, who held court here ‘mid scenes of great splendor and magnificence. Scene 19. Here luxury and ease encouraged vice, sensuality, and lust, and the blighting curse of God’s displeasure will one day fall upon it; and Tadmor will become a heap of ruins, desolate and forsaken by Him whom its people forsake. The Lord is true to those who serve Him, but those who forsake Him must miserably perish Scene 20 What is that I see in the dis - tance? Two caravans engaged in combat! Let us go around and avoid them. 1• * * * * * That was a narrow escape and has brought us into an abandoned path. The old bridge over this ravine appears to be unsafe. Stop, let us examine it.

Scene 21. Yonder is Riblah, the headquar - ters of Nebuchadnezzar during the siege of Jerusalem. Scene 22. When the city was taken about midnight, King Zedekiah, with his wives, sons, chief captains, and friends, escaped through the fortified ditch. Scene 23. But were overtaken near Jericho, where many of his friends were slain or for - sook him, and King Zedekiah was captured and taken before King Nebuchadnezzar. Scene 24. Who rebuked him as a covenant breaker, and caused his sons and friends to be slain in his presence; Scene 25. After which the treacherous king’s eyes were put out. Scene 26. And he was carried in chains to Babylon. Thus was brought to pass the words of the good prophet Ezekiel that Zedekiah should go to Babylon, nevertheless, he should not see that city. What a striking lesson is the history of this physically strong, yet morally weak, king! Although the body may be per- fect, the mind have capa~ity to think and act and the intelligence to comprehend, yet is man imperfect unless body, mind, and intel - lect are cared for, gutded, and directed by that unseen, yet all forceful, power, the human soul, the ever-present manifestation of the presence of our God 181 Scene 27. At Ribl~h, too, Seriah the High Priest and other priests and rulers of the Tem - ple were beheaded by order of Nebuchadnez - zar. Scene 28 We are now approaching the beautiful city of Damascus, founded by Uz, the grandson of Shem. It is situated in the midst of delightful date palms, gardens of vineyards, while the luxuriance of the smaller vegetation makes this city and surroundings the most beautiful place in the world Scene 29. See the towers and minarets glis - tening in the sunlight, as we get a nearer view of the city. Scene 30. We have now entered the city by the old east gate and have before us a street scene, or the great Via Recta, the street called Straight, flanked on either side with luxuriant bazaars, in which are displayed a variety of wares from all the markets of the world. Scene 31. Here also are manufactured silk - en and woolen fabrics of wondrous beauty and design, rivaling if not excelling those of any other city in the world, while in other shops and bazaars are displayed a variety of Damas - cus wares, either for use or personal adorn - ment. Scene 32. We have now left the city and are journeying to the south. To the right we behold the mountains of Lebanon, where our fathers felled and prepared the timbers for the first Temple. Scene 33.

We are now in desert wilderness of Judea. Before us is a deep gorge through which flows the brook Cherith. Somewhere in this lonely ravine the good prophet Elijah found refuge when pursued by the wicked and idolatrous Jezebel and Ahab, and it was here in this lonely valley that he was miraculously fed by the ravens. Scene 36. To the right we behold the ruins of Jericho of old, which fell before Joshua’s conquering hosts. Perhaps from yonder ele - vation we may obtain a view of the object of our long journey. Scene 37. Oh, Joy Unspeakable! We are on the summit of Mt. Olivet Before us is the hill of Zion; the jewel of the mountains; the city of our God! Jerusalem! the dwelling place of Jehovah. But as we gaze upon her in ruins, do we not in our minds see her as on that ter - rible day of sack and desolation; the city de - voured by a consuming fire, her walls broken and useless; the Temple in ruins, and her 183 proud, yet rebellious people banished and dis - persed to her captors? Scene 38. Aye! We see again the warlike hosts of Nebuchadnezzar, commanded by Neb - uzaradan in his terrible chariot, pressing for - ward with spear and sabre, trampling ruth- lessly under foot the fallen and helpless vic - tims; Scene 39. Sparing neither young man nor maiden, old man or him that stooped for age. All, all are consumed in that terrible vortex of war and conquest. Scene 40. But look! Behold the followers of the good prophet Ezra. They are upon the ruined walls. Listen! We hear the claron notes of the bugle ca]ling the people to return. Scene 41. See them! They are engag~d in the work of the restoraton; and this is Jeru - salem. How our hearts swell with pride as we behold her and our Brethren. How the blood quickens in our veins and our souls yearn to ‘oin them in this noble and glorious work. Scene 42. For Jerusalem shall be rebuilded; her walls set up, the Temple restored and the glorious Shekinah appear as in the days of old. Oh. my Brethren, may it not be that we are chosen for a great work. May it not be that we are those of whom the good prophet Isaiah wrote concerning Jerusalem when he said~ “Arise, shine~ for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nL w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus. ni ,w. stichtingargus.n I ‘w. stichtingargus .n 1 w. stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n 1 w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n 1 ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.n] ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nI ‘w. stichtingargus.nI ‘w. stichtingargus.nI ‘w.stichtingargus.n I ‘w. stichti ngargus .n I ‘w.stichtingargus.n I ‘w.stichtingargus.n ‘w.stichtingargus.n 184 Scene 43 “Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee, and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet, and they shall call thee, The City of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel “ Oh, my Brethren, let us hasten forward to engage in the noble and glorious work of re - building the House of the Lord; and while we are rebuilding the House of the Lord let us also remember that we should erect a spiritual temple in our own hearts and the hearts of our fellow men, a temple conceived in Faith, born of Hope, and dedicated to Charity; a temple, the foundation of which is Love, our God the Father to all and every man a brother to his fellow man Scene 44.
