It being divided into twenty-four equal p arts, is emblematic of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts; whereby are found eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother, eight for our usual vocations, and eight for refreshment and sleep. The Common Gaz~el is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I as Free and Accepted. Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and super - fluities of life; thereby fitting our minds as living stones for that spiritual building, that house “not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” Lecture FIRST SECTION * * * * * * * * * * * SECOND SECTION * * * * * * * * * * * Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and con - cerning changing, for ‘to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was a Israel.—Ruth iv.7. testimony in * * * * * * * * * * * Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.—Matthew vii.7. * * * * * * * * * * * The left side is considered the weaker part of man * * * * * * Your right hand * * * * * because our ancient brethren deemed the right hand to be the emblem of fidelity and as they worshipped Deity under the name of “Fides” which was supposed to be repre - sented by the right hands joined, and by two human figures grasping each other by 7 8 9"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the right hands.

Our ancient brethren met on the highest hills and in the lowest valleys, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, and to guard against sur - prise. A Lodge is said, symbolically, to extend in length from east to west; in breadth, from north to south; in height, from the earth to the highest heavens; in depth, from the surface to the center. And a Lodge is said to be of these vast dimensions to denote the universality of N4asonry, and to teach us that a Mason’s charity should be equally as extensive. A Lodge has three principal supports, which are Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, because it is necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and im - portant undertakings. Its covering is no less than a clouded canopy or starry-decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by the aid of that theological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw ascending from earth to heaven, the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity, and which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity; for our Faith may be lost in sight; Hope ends in fruition; but Charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. The furniture of a lodge consists of a Holy Bible, Square,~ and Compasses. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God; the Square, to the Master; and the Compasses, to the craft. The Bible is dedicated to God because 10 11"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"it is the inestimable gift of God to man; * * * * the Square, to the Master, be - cause it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; an dthe Compasses, to the Craft, because, by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe their de - sires, and keep their passions within due bounds. The ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavemeni, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; and the indented tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border or skirt - ing which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematic of human life, checkered with good and evil; the beautiful border which surrounds it is emblematic of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphic - ally represented by the blazing star in the center. A Lodge has three symbolic lights; one of these is in the East, one in the West, and one in the South. There is no light in the North, because King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was placed so far north of the ecliptic, that the sun and moon, at their meridian height, could dart no rays into the northern part thereof. The north we therefore masonic- ally call a place of darkness. A Lodge has six jewels; three of these are immovable and three movable. The immovable jewels are the Square, Level, and Plumb. The square inculcates morality; the level, equality; and the plumb, rectitude of conduct. They are called immovable jewels be - cause they are always to be found in the East, West and South parts of the Lodge, being worn by the officers in these respective stations. The movable jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar and the Trestle Board. The rough ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The perfect ashlar is a,stone made ready by the hands of tl~e workmen, to be ad - justed by the working tools of the fellow- craft. The trestle-board is for the master work - man to draw his designs upon. 12 13"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"By the rough ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the perfect ashlar, ti=at state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, out own endeavors, and the blessing of God, and by the trestle-board we are also reminded that, as the o erative workman erects his temporal ~ui Iding agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his trestle-board, so should we, both operative and speculative, en - deavor to erect our spiritual building agree - ably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of nature and revelation, which are our spiritual, moral, and masonic trestle-board. A Lodge is situated due east and west, because, when Moses crossed the Red Sea, being pursued by Pharaoh and his host, he erected on the other side, by divine com - mand, a tabernacle, which he placed due east and west, to receive the first rays of the rising sun, and to commemorate that mighty east wind by which their miraculous deliverance was effected. This tabernacle was an exact pattern of King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a repre - sentation, and it is, or ought, therefore,~o be placed due east and west. 14 Our ancient brethren dedicated their lodges to King Solomon, because he was • our first Most Excellent Grand Master; but modern Masons dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evan - gelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time, there is represented, in every regular and well governed Lodge, a certain point within a circle, embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist; and upon the top rests the Holy Scriptures. The point represents an individual brother; the circle is the boundary line, beyond which he is never to suffer his prejudices or pas - • sions to betray him. In going round this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within these due bounds; it is impossible • that he should materially err. The three great tenets of a Mason’s pro - fession are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. By the exercise of~ brotherly love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family; the high and low, the rich and poor, who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, is L"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"are te aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and con - ciliates true friendship among ,those who might otherwise have remained at a per - petual distance. To relieve the distressed is a duty in - cumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friend- ships and establish our connections. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contem - plate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct; hence, while in - fluenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain-dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’~ prosperity. Every Mason has * * * * which are illustrated by the four cardinal virtues, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Jus - tice. * * * * * As entered apprentices served * * CHARGE My Brother: As you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honorable Order; ancient, as having sub- sisted from time immemorial; and honor - able, as tending, in every particular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lec - tures. The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been encouragers and pro - moters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level them - selves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To • God, in never mentioning his name but 16 17"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"- with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his creator; to implore his aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to esteem him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you. And to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous at - tachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the State, you are to be a quiet and peaceful subject, true to your government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the govern - ment of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected. neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, mayridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be ready to receive instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the order, as these are to dis - tinguish you from the rest of the com - munity, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaint - ance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly at - tentive not to recommend him unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the Institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects.

WORKING TOOLS The working tools of a Fellow Craft are the Plumb, the Square, and the Level *** The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to raise perpen - diculars; the Square, to square their work; and the Level, to lay horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes; the plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations, 20 before God and men, squaring our actions by the square of virtue, and remembering that we are traveling upon the level of time to that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns.

By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and a just cor - respondence in all its parts, and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and bene - ficent purposes. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy and practice charity.

The ancient and original Orders of Architecture revered by Masons are no more than three—the Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two; the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and par - ticular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only acci - dently; the Tuscan i’s the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, rher.efore, and not to the Romans, are we 22 23"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. Of these five orders, the Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian as the most ancient, are most esteemed by Masons.

By it we may discover how the planets move in their different orbits, and demon - strate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season dis - plays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the 24 25"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of Nature. A survey of Nature, and the observations of her beautiful proportions, first deter - mined man to imitate the Divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valu - able monuments of antiquity on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of bar - barous force. Freemasonry, notwithstand - ing, has still survived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of faith - ful breasts. Tools and instruments of architecture, and symbolic emblems, most eKpressive, are selected by the fraternity to imprint on the mind wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired, the most excellent tenets of our institution. ****** to the great and sacred name of the Grand Geometrician of the Universe, before whom all Masons, from the youngest E. A., to the W. M., should humbly, rever - ently and devoutly bow. CHARGE My Brother: Being passed to the second degree of Masonry, we congratulate you on your preferment. The internal, and not the ‘external qualifications of a man are~what Masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Mason, you are bound to discharge, or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly exe - cuted. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offences of your brethren; but, in the decision of every trespass against our rules, 26 27"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valu - able branch of education, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your con - sideration; especially the science of geom - etry, which is established as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the won - derful properties of nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deport - ment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new character it is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Order, by steadily per - severing in the practice of every commend - able virtue. Such is the nature of your engagement as a Fellow Craft, and to these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties. GRAMMAR Teaches the proper arrangement of words, according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people; and that excellency of pronunciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agree - ably to reason and correct usage. RHETORIC Teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with propriety alone, but with all the advantage of force and elegance, wisely contriving to captivate the hearer by strength of argu - ment and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat or exhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC Teaches us to guide our reason dis - cretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce, and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted, or granted; and in it are em - ployed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning, and disposing, all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally determined. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation, or ground-work, of our 28 29"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"inquiries; particularly in the pursuit of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons. ARITHMETIC Teaches the powers and properties of numbers, which are variously affected by letters, tables, figures, and instruments. By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given for finding out any certain num - ber whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. The greater p advancement we make in the mathematical sciences, the more capable we shall be of considering such things as are the ordinary objects of our conceptions, and be thereby led to a more comprehensive knowledge of our great Creator and the works of the creation. GEOMETRY Treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered, from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure, or an indivisible part of a space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth, and thickness. By this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general, to arrange his soldiers; the geog~apher, to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein con - tained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the duration of time and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, geometry is the foundation of architecture, and the root of mathematics. MUSIC Teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose delightful harmony, by a mathematical and proportional arrange - ment of acute, grave, and mixed sounds. This art, by a series of experiments, is reduced to a demon’strative science, with respect to tones and the intervals of sound. It inquires into the nature of concords and 30 31"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"discords, and enables us to find out the proportion between them by numbers. ASTRONOMY Is that divine art by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the Almighty Creator in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere. Assisted by astronomy, we can observe the magnitudes, and calculate the periods and eclipses of the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globes, the system of the world, and the preliminary laws of nature. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive unparal - leled instances of wisdom and goodness; and, through the whole creation, trace the glorious Author by his works. 32 Master Mason * * * * * * * * * * * SCRIPTURE Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shall say, I have no pleasure in them; while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain; on the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened and the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; also when they shall be afraid of that which is high~ and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about~ the streets; or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.

WORKING TOOLS The working Tools of a Master Mason are all the implements of Masonry, indis - criminarely, but more especially the Trowel. The Trowel is an instrument made use of by Operative Masons to spread the cement which unites a building into one common mass; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of spreading the cement of brotherly love and affection; that cement which unites us into one sacred band, or society of friends and brothers, among whom no contention should ever exist, but that noble contention, or rather emulation, of who can best work and best agree. PRAYER Thou, 0 God! knowest our down-sitting and our up-rising, and understandest our thoughts afar off. Shield and defend us from the evil intentions of our enemies, and support us under the trials and afflic - tions we are destined, to endure, while traveling through this vale of tears. Man, 34 t that is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; turn from him that he may rest, till he shall accom - plish his day. For there is hope of a tree, if jt be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not up, till the heavens shall be no more. Yet, 0 Lord! have compassion on the children of thy creation, administer them comfort in time of trouble, and save them with an exerlasting salvation. Amen. So mote it be.

The Three Steps, usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet, are emblematic of the three principal stages of human life: Youth, Manhood and Age. In Youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to oc - cupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the dis - charge of our respective duties to God, our Neighbor, and ourselves; so that in Age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflections consequent on a well-spentlife, and die in the hope of a glorious immor - tality. The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great beneficent Author of our existence, for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. The Bee-Hive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph 36 in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us, that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow- creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve them without in - convenience to ourselves. The Book of Constitutions, Guarded by the Tiler’s Sword, reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our words and actions, particularly when before the enemies o fM asonry; ever bearing in re - membrance those truly Masonic virtues, Silence and Circumspection. The Sword Pointing to a Naked [-leart demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of men, yet that All Seeing Eye, whom the Sun, Moon, and Stars obey, and under whose watchful care even Comets perform their stupendous revolutions, per - vades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits.

The Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid. This was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of priest - hood, and raised to the Sublime f)egree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry ‘or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most distinguished he erected this, when, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed, Eureka, in the Grecian Lan - guage signifying “I have found it,” and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. The Hour-Glass is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot without astonishment behold the little particles which are con - tained in this machine; how they pass away almost imperceptibly! and yet, to our sur - prise, in the short space of an hour they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man!
