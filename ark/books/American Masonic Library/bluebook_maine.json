Drummond was originally published by the Grand Lodge of Maine in 1877 for the purpose of assisting the lodges in resolving the questions which continually arise, and as a monitor of the various ceremonies. The sixteenth edition has been printed without the \"Digest of Decisions.\" It is important to publish the \"Digest of Decisions in a format which can be readily updated. In past formats, each Grand Master's Decisions have had to remain unprinted until the supply of text books ran out, and a new edition was printed. Not having the Digest of Decisions printed in the Text Book allows the book to remain current.

ITS ORGANIZATIONS. HISTORY The Institution of Masonry, or Freemasonry (for these terms are used indiscriminately), is founded upon the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man: it. therefore, necessarily teaches Morality, Brotherly Love, and Charity: its method of teaching is chiefly by symbols: it has many forms and ceremonies, but these are all intended to teach and impress upon the mind the great principles of the Institution: its votaries are seeking after Truth, symbolized by Light. A Provincial Grand Lodge was formed in Massachusetts under the authority of the Grand Lodge of England, in 1733; and another, under the authority of the Grand Lodge of Scotand, in 1769: during the revolution, these Bodies declared themselves independent of their Mother Grand Lodges, and, in 1792, both united as the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. The first lodge in Maine PORTLAND) was chartered by the English Provincial Grand Lodge; the second (WARREN) by the Scottish Provincial Grand Lodge; and the third (LINCOLN) by the United Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. When Maine became an independent State in 1820, the Lodges, thirtyone in number, formed the Grand Lodge of Maine, in accordance with the wellsettled principle of masonic law, that the lodges in every independent State are of right entitled to form a Grand Lodge for that State. The Grand Lodge of Maine exercises exclusive masonic jurisdiction in this State, and any lodge, organized by any other authority, is illegal and clandestine, with which, or with whose members, no masonic intercourse can be held.

The petition of John Doe for the degrees of masonry, with the usual deposit, was received and referred to the Committee of Inquiry. The committee of Inquiry reported upon the petition of Richard Roe; their report was accepted, the ballot spread, and Richard Roe was elected to receive the degrees within the gift of the lodge. The Committee of Inquiry reported upon the petition of John Roe; their report was accepted, the ballot spread, and he was declared rejected.

CHAPTER III ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES. THE FIRST DEGREE When a candidate, whom a Mason is willing to recommend,desires to apply for initiation, care must be taken that he presents his petition to the lodge nearest his residence. The determination of the place of one's residence is often difficult, especially in Maine, from which so many young men go away into other States to seek employment. the residence, intended by our Constitution, is the home where the party has the right to vote and is bound to pay taxes. This test will generally settle the question, but no rule can be given by which every case can be decided. By a regulation, adopted by most of the Grand Lodges in America, no candidate for the mysteries of Masonry can be initiated without having been proposed at a previous meeting Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (4 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:54 AM]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of the lodge (except by dispensation from the Grand Master) in order that no one may be introduced without due inquiry relative to his character and qualifications.

If practicable, the candidate should examine the Constitution of the Grand Lodge and the bylaws of the lodge before he presents his petition. When the petition is presented, if it appears on its face that the lodge has no jurisdiction of the candidate, it should not be received, but be returned to him; if the lodge appears to have jurisdiction, the petition should be referred to the Committee of Inquiry: after its reference, it cannot be withdrawn by the petitioner until after a favorable ballot. The first duty of the committee is to ascertain beyond question whether the lodge has jurisdiction: if they find that it has not, they should report that fact to the lodge, and if jurisdiction cannot be obtained, the petition must be returned. If the candidate does notreside within thejurisdiction of the lodge, or has not resided there the required time, or is physically disqualified, or has been previously rejected by another lodge, the lodge has no jurisdiction unless it obtains the consent of the other lodge, in those cases in which consent gives jurisdiction. If the committee find that the lodge has jurisdiction, they then inquire and report on the fitness of the candidate to be made a masona duty to be performed with Zealous care and prudence, and \"without fear, favor or affection\": and the character of their report, whether favorable or unfavorable, should never be entered of record.

'Tis like the oil on Aaron's head, Which to his feet distils;Like Hermon's dew, so richly shed On Zion's sacred hills.

On Friendship's altar rising here, Our hands now plighted be, To live in love, with hearts sincere, In peace and unity. THE LAMBSKIN, OR WHITE LEATHER APRON. Is an emblem of innocence, and the badge of a Mason; more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle; more honorable than the Star and Garter, or any other Order that can be conferred upon you at this or any future period, by King, Prince, Potentate, or any other person, except he be a Mason, and which I hope you will wear with pleasure to yourself and honor to the Fraternity. THE TWENTYFOUR INCH GAUGE. Is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It being divided into twentyfour equal parts, is emblematical of the twentyfour hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy Brother; eight for our usual vocations; and eight for refreshment and sleep. COMMON GAVEL. The common gavel is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder's use, but we as Free and Accepted Masons are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our minds and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting us as living stones for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. SECOND SECTION. THE BADGE OF A MASON. The lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence. He, therefore, who wears the.lambskin as a badge of Masonry, is thereby continually reminded of that purity of life and conduct which is essentially necessary to his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.

A LODGE Is a certain number of Masons duly assembled, having the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, with a charter or warrant empowering them to work. THE FORM OF A LODGE. * * * * * THE SUPPORTS OF A LODGE. Our Institution is said to be supported by three great pillars, called WISDOM, STRENGTH and BEAUTY. It is necessary there should be Wisdom to contrive, Strength to support, and Beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. COVERING OF A LODGE. It is no less than the clouded canopy or starry decked heaven, where all good masons hope at last to arrive, by the aid of that theological ladder which Jacob in his vision saw ascending from earth to heaven called Jacob's Ladder, the three principal rounds of which are called Faith, Hope and Charity. The greatest of these is Charity, because our Faith may be lost in sight, Hope ends in fruition, but Charity extends beyond the grave through the boundless realms of eternity. FURNITURE OF A LODGE. The HOLY BIBLE, the SQUARE and the COMPASSES. The Holy Bible we dedicate to God, the Square to the Master and the Compasses to the Craft. The Bible we dedicate to God because it is the inestimable gift of God to man *** the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the compasses to the Craft, because by its use, we are taught to circumscribe our desires, and keep our passions within due bounds. THE ORNAMENTS OF A LODGE . The Mosaic Pavement, Indented Tessel, and Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon's Temple; the Indented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border, or skirting, which surrounded it,with the Blazing Star in the centre. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the beautiful border which surrounds it, of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the centre.

The movable jewels are the SQUARE, LEVEL and PLUMB. The Square teaches morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of life. The immovable jewels are the ROUGH ASHLAR, the PERFECT, ASHLAR and the TRESTLEBOARD. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, tobe adjustedby the workingtools of the Fellow Craft. The TreslieBoard is for the Master to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive, by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and,by the TresdeBoard, we are also reminded, that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his TrestleBoard, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of Nature and Revelation, which are our spiritual, moral and Masonic TrestleBoard. SITUATION. Lodges should be situated due east and west DEDICATION. Lodges in ancient times were dedicated to King Solomon In modern times to St. John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, two eminent Christian patrons of Freemasonry; and since their time there has been represented in every regular and wellfurnished lodge, a certain point within a circle embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. Upon the top of the circle rests the Book of Holy Scriptures. The point represents an individual Brother; the circle, the boundary line of his duty. In going around this circle, we necessarily touch on the two parallel lines, as well as on the Book of Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err. TENETS. The tenets of your profession as a Mason are Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (10 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"BROTHERLY LOVE. By the exercise of Brotherly Love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one familythe high and low, rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support and protect each other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who profess to be linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, sympathize with their misfortunes, compassionate their miseries, and restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. TRUTH. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us; sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other's welfare and rejoicing in each other's Prosperity. * * * * * CARDINAL VIRTUES. The four Cardinal virtues are Temperence, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice Temperence Is that due restraint upon our affections and passions, which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or the conLracting of any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence in which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequendy subject him to the contempt and detestation ofall good Masons.**** FORTITUDE Is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril or danger, when prudentially deemed expedient.

This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token or word, whereby the secrets of Freemasonry may be unlawfully obtained * JUSTICE Is that standard or boundary of right, which enables to render unto every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and as justice in a great measure constitutes the really good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate from the minutest principle thereof; FREEDOM, FERVENCY AND ZEAL. * * * * * CHARGE AT INITIATION INTO THE FIRST DEGREE. BROTHER:AS you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honorable order; ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial; and honorable, as tending in every particular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better principle, or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down, than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men in all ages have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory from their dignity to level themselves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties, which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (12 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"mentioning his name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his creator; to implore his aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to esteem him as the chief good: to your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you: and to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will ensure public and private esteem. In the State, you are to be a quiet and peaceful subject, true to your government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with Cheerfulness to that government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity or influence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations; for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with wellinformed brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be ready to receive, instruction. Finally: keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated in to Masonry, be particularly attentive not to recommend him, unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory and reputation of the Institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. CHAPTER IV. THE SECOND, OR FELLOW CRAFTS' DEGREE . The Master is the judge as to the proper time for the advancement of a candidate: but be should not be advanced until he has made himself sufficiently familiar with the preceding degree to be able to work his way into a lodge open on that degree. If objections are made to his advancement, they must be submitted to the lodge and their sufficiency determined by a twothirds vote.

Thus he showed me: and behold the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. And the Lord said unto me,Amos, what seest thou? And I said, a plumbline. Then said the Lord, I behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people? Israel: I will not again pass by them any more. In some jurisdictions, the following lesson is read: Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge,and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. And now abideth faith, hope and charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. The following hymn may be used in place of the lesson: MusicShirland. I.

The plumb is an instrument made use of by operative masons, to raise perpendiculars; the square, to square their work; and the level, to lay horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes: the plumb admonishes us to walk uprighty in our several stations before God and man, squaring our actions by the square of virtue, and remembering that we are travelling upon the level of time, to \"that undiscovered country, from whose bourne no traveler returns.\" CORN, WINE AND OIL. SECOND SECTION Masonry is considered under two denominations: operative and speculative. OPERATIVE MASONRY. By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and from which will result a due proportion and just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings, and convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man, for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes.

By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator. IN SIX DAYS God created the heaven and the earth, and rested upon the seventh day; the seventh therefore our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of the creation and to adore their great Creator. PEACE, UNITY AND PLENTY. * * * * * OF THE GLOBES. The globes are two artificial spherical bodies, on the convex surface of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other particulars. The sphere, with the parts of the earth delineated on its surface, is called the terrestrial globe; and that with the constellations, and other heavenly bodies, the celestial globe.

They are the noblest instruments for improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problern or proposiLion, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and the works, and are induced to encourage the studies of astronomy, geography, navigation, and the arts dependent on them, by which society has been so much benefitted. * * * * * OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE. By order in architecture, is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. OF ITS ANTIQUITY. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter form the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands, which connected those trees at the top and bottom, are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. * * * * * Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (17 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" THE TUSCAN Is the most simple and solid of the five orders. it was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its col umn is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the construcfion of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. THE DORIC Which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, except mouldings; though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference, in structures where strength and noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state. In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric; for when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblence to that pillar in its original state. THE IONIC Bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentals. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar; the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young women of an elegant shape dressed in her hair; as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust young man. THE CORINTHIAN.

Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentals and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth, by Callimachus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the following remarkable circumstance: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady he perceived a basket of toys covered with a tile, placed over an a canthus root, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up they encompassed the basket, till, arriving at the tile, they meet with an obstruction, and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with the object, set about imitating the figure: the base of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus the tile; and the volutes the bending leaves. THE COMPOSITE Is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has the quarterround, as the Tuscan and Doric order; is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentals, or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance and beauty are displayed. OF THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE. The ancient and original orders of architecture, revered by Masons, are no more than threeThe Doric, Ionic, and Corinthianwhich were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally; the Tuscan is Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (19 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in architecture. THE FIVE SENSES. HEARING, SEEING, FEELING, SMELLING AND TASTJNG. The first three, Hearing, Seeing and Feeling, are deemed peculiarly essential to Masons;****~ HEARING Is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions,our purposes and desires; while thus our reason is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge by the information of others. For these purposes we are endowed with hearing, that, by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete. SEEING Is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structure, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of nature. By this sense we find our way in the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of ii By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more: by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections of our fellowcreatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (20 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"which administer to this sense are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye, and its appurtenances, evinces the admirable contrivance of nature for performing all its various external and internal motions; while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demonstrates this organ to be the masterpiece of nature's work. FEELING Is that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of bodies: such as heat and cold, hardness and softness ,roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion and extension. SMELLING Is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of vast subtilty, as well in the state of life and growth as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effluvia, being drawn into the nostrils with the air, are the means by which all bodies are smelled. Hence it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator's having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal, through which the air continually passes in respiration. TASTING Enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that ofsmelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by it we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (21 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Smelling and tasting are inseparably connected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices. On the mind all our knowledge must depend: what, therefore, can be a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons? By anatomical dissection and observation we become acquainted with the body; but it is by the anatomy of the mind alone we discover its power and principles. To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God's bounty to man, we shall add that memory, imagination, taste, reasoning, moral perception, and all the active powers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field for philosophical disquisition, which far exceeds human inquiry,and are perculiar mysteries, known only to nature and to nature's God, to whom we and all are indebted for creation, preservation, and every blessing we enjoy. * * * * * OF THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES. GRAMMAR Teaches the proper arrangement of words, according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people; and that excellency of pronunciation, which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeably to reason and correct usage. RHETORIC Teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with propriety, but with all the advantages of force and elegance; wisely contriving to captivate the Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (22 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat or exhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC Teaches us to guide our reason discretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted or granted; and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning and disposing; all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally determined. ARITHMETIC Teaches the powers and properties of numbers, which is variously effected, by letters, tables, figures and instruments. By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given for finding out any certain number, whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. GEOMETRY Treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered, from apoint to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure; or an indivisible part of space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth and thickness. OF THE ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY.

In fine, geometry is the foundation ofarchitecture, and the root of the mathematics. MUSIC Teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose delightful harmony, by a mathematical and proportional arrangement of acute, grave and mixed sounds. This art, by a series of experiments, is reduced to a demonstrative science, with respect to tones and the intervals of sound. It inquires into the nature of concords and discords, and enables us to find out the proportion between them by numbers. ASTRONOMY Is that divine art, by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the Almighty Creator, in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere. Assisted by astronomy, we can observe the motions, measure the distances, comprehend the magnitudes, and calculate the periods and eclipses of the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globes, the system of the world, and the preliminary law of nature. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive unparalleled instances of wisdom and goodness, and through the whole creation trace the glorious Author by his works.

When we take a survey of Nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attacks of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent; but, as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship.

INSTALLATION OF THE OFFICERS OF A LODGE. No one, elected or appointed to office in a chartered lodge,can enter upon the discharge of his duties until he has been installed. The officers of a lodge under dispensation receive their authority directly from the Grand Master or Grand Lodge, and cannot he installed: and they acquire no rank by such service. The officers of a newly constituted lodge are installed by the Grand Master, or his representative: and he may, in person or by special Deputy, at his pleasure install the officers of any lodge. Subject to this prerogative of the Grand Master, it is the right and duty of every Master to install his successor, or cause him to be installed. But a Warden, acting as Master, cannot, unless he is a Past Master, install his successor, although he may call a Past Master to the chair to perform the ceremony. Any Past Master, and no one but a Past Master (and by that term is meant the Past Master of a lodge), can install a Master. When the Master has been installed, it devolves upon him to install the other officers, but, of course, he may call upon the one who installed him to install all of them. In England, it has been the custom for each subordinate officer to install his successor, but it has not been adopted in this country to any great extent: the retiring officer is sometimes called upon to invest his successor, and even to deliver the charge, but he does this only as the mouthpiece of the Installing Officer. An installed officer holds his office until his successor is installed: and hence, while a reelected officer should be reinstalled, yet, if he is not, he will hold his office by virtue of his former election and installation. Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (36 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:55 AM]"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"If objections are made by a member of the lodge, to the installation of any officer, the Installing Officer should examine the objections, and, if he deems them insufficient, should proceed with the installation: but if he deems them sufficient, he must suspend the installation of that officer and appoint a time and place for a hearing upon the truth of the allegations upon which the objections are based. If he finds that the allegations are not true, he installs the officer: if he finds that they are true, and that the officer ought not to be installed, he must send to the lodge a certificate to that effect to he entered on its records, and the proper measures should be taken to hold a new election. If the installing officer is the Grand Master, or his Deputy specially authorized to hear and determine objections to an installation, there is no appeal from his decision: but in all other cases, an appeal lies to the Grand Master from the final decision ~fth~ Installing Officer, and, in case an appeal is taken, all further proceedings are suspended until it is determined. But if the decision of the Installing Officer is that the objections are not sufficient, or are not sustained at the hearing, the appeal from his decision must he taken before the insiallation, or it will be too late. While, in some jurisdictions, officers can be installed only in a tyled lodge, in this and most others they may be installed in public. When the installation is public, arrangements should be made for the following programme: Music PRAYER Music. Installation Of The Master. Music.Master's Installation Ode.

The lodge should open at its Hall and march in procession to the place where the ceremonies are to be performed: and, after they are finished, retum to its Hall and close. If thc services are at the Hall, the lodge should be opened and closed in an anteroom, and never in the presence of profanes. A portion of the ceremony of the installation of a Master can be performed only in a Convention of not less than three Past Masters of a lodge. It is known as the Past Master's Degree,\" and is often confounded with a degree of the same name conferred in Royal Arch Chapters; but the Chapter Past Master cannot, in this State, be recognized by a Past Master of a lodge. In different jurisdictions, the usage, as to the time when this ceremony is to be performed, differs: in some, it must be performed as a part of the installation ceremony; in these, when the installation is inalodge, all exceptPast Masters (including Masters in the chair) are reqrnred, at the proper time, to retire, while the Master is invested with this \"degree,\" and then to return to assist in the remaining ceremonies; and when the installation is public, this ceremony is either performed before leaving the lodge room for the public hall, or after returning from the public services: in others, the Installing Officer, at his convenience, generally before, but it may be after, the installation, with the necessary assistance, performs this part of the ceremony. After installation the officer is entitled to serve, unless it appears that he is actually ineligible, all other questions being settled by the installation. When an officer is declared. by competent authority, to be duly installed, his installation is valid, although portions, or even all, of the ceremony have been omitted. When a meeting is held for installation, the lodge must be opened on the third degree. A suitable Brother is appointed as Marshal for the occasion, to present the officers and perform such other duties as the Installing Officer may require of him. After a prayer and (if practicable) appropriate music, the Marshal, by direction of the Installing Officer, collects the Jewels, the Three Great Lights, the Rule, the Line, the Book of Constitutions, the Charter, the Records, the ByLaws, the Gavel, the Truncheons of the Wardens, the Deacons' Rods, the Stewards' Rods, the Marshal's Baton and the Tyler's Sword, and place them upon a table, so arranged that he can promptly hand them to the Installing Officer when required.

When a visit from the Grand Lodge is announced, the Master, having opened the lodge on the third degree, stations the Deacons and Stewards at the sides of the door with their rods crossed, and arranges the Brethren in lines from the door to the Chair, facing inwards. He then sends a Past Master to escort the Grand Lodge, which enters in procession, the Grand Tyler, however, remaining at the door. The Grand Lodge proceeds up to the East, and opens to the right and left, when the Grand Master passes through and ascends the Master's platform, and the other Grand Officers pass to the righL of the Master. The Master receives the Grand Master according to ancient usage, with the private grand honors of Masonry, and resigns to him the chair and the gavel, whereupon each other Grand Officer assumes his appropriate station in place of the corresponding officer of the lodge, and the Brethren are seated.

No brother should be allowed to visit a lodge for the first time without an introduction. If the visitor is a Past Master, he should be invited to a seat Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (54 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"in the East: and if he is an Officer of any Grand Lodge, or a Permanent Member of our own Grand Lodge, or a Past Grand Master, he should be received with the grand honors at the time of his introduction.

He should invariably, as soon as the lodge is opened, give a general invitation to all Past Masters to take seats in the East: and this invitation should be accepted by those present, unless there are special reasons for not doing so. CHAPTER VIII. MASONIC PROCESSIONS The too great frequency of Masonic Processions in public is an evil greatly to be deplored. In this State no lodge can form a public procession, except for funerals and attendance upon Divine Services, without the consent of the Grand Master. Formerly lodges had the right to appear in public on St. John's Days; and if the ancient manner of celebrating those days should ever again prevail undoubtedly lodges would be permitted to do so without being required to obtain special permission. The rule is that Masonic processions are allowable only when some Masonic work is to be done. But in former times Masons frequently appeared in public in their distinctive character to pay respect to the Chief Magistrate, either upon occasions of a public reception of him, or of public mourning for his death. Some have attempted to make a distinction, holding that when the Chief Magistrate is, or has been a Mason such a course is proper, but when not it is improper. But an examination of the Old Charges and Regulations will clearly show that there is no ground for this distinction, and that they teach the propriety of Masons, in their character as such, honoring the Chief Magistrate while living, and mourning for him when dead. The post of honor in Masonic processions is in the rear. Marshals should walk or ride on the left flank of a procession. When a procession faces inwards, the Deacons and Stewards cross their rods, so as to form an arch for the Brethren to pass beneath. All processions return in the same order in which they set out. The Musicians, if Masons, follow the Stewards: otherwise they precede the Tyler.

In WEB's Monitor, published in 1805, and in subsequent editions, places are assigned, in processions of lodges, to Royal Arch Masons and Knights Templar immediately preceding the Masterand it was for some time customary for masons of those degrees to take places in a lodge procession, clothed in their peculiar insignia. This is believed to have been an innovation at that time, as it is not found in any of the earlier Monitors, either of WEBB or other authors. Indeed, in the Pennsylvania Ahiman Rezon of 1783, it is stated by the authority of DERMOTT in 1772, that \"Royal Arch Masons must not, at a procession, nor in any other place except in the Royal Arch Lodge, be distinguished by any garment or badge different from what belongs to them as officers or members of the Grand, or their own private lodge.\" Dalcho, in his Ahiman Rezon of 1807, says: \"In all Masonick Processions, no Freemasons shall wear the insignia of any order above the degree of a Master Mason\": but, in his edition of 1822, he assigns a place in.lodge processions to \"Masons of such of the higher degrees as are recognized by the Grand Lodge, in the form of their respective Orders,\" and changes the sentence above quoted to the following: \"In all Masonic Processions, no Freemason shall wear the insignia of any Order which is not recognized by the Grand Lodge.\" Most of the recent Monitors have followed the precedent of WEBB: Mackey, however, follows DALCHO, and assigns places to \"members of the higher degrees.\" The better practice is to follow DERMOTT's, and DALCHO's original rule, except in cases in which a Mason of a different grade has been invited, in his distinctive or official character, by the Body or Officer having charge, to participate in Lile ceremonies. But bodies of other grades, recognized as Masonic, may properly be assigned positions in Masonic processions. Knights Templar, and similar organizations, appearing as a body, should always act as escort: other bodies are placed immediately in front of the officiating lodge, and the Grand Lodge, if that is in attendance. At the funeral of Past Grand Master ROBERT P. DUNLAP, his Commandery acted as escort, his Chapter marched in the procession immediately in front of his Lodge, and members of the Supreme Council, in which he was an officer, in their distinctive clothing, accompanied the Grand Lodge. The same is true of the funeral of CHARLES W. MOORE, with the addition that a body of the Scottish Rite, of which he was a member, also marched in the procession. At the laying of the cornerstone ofthe Masonic Temple in Boston, the Grand Commandery, followed by its subordinates, acted as escort to the procession; the Grand Chapter, preceded by its subordinates, was posted immediately in front of the Grand Lodge, which was accompanied by a Commandery, as a Guard of Honor, Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (56 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"onehalf marching in front and onehalf in the rear of the Grand Lodge: the same order was observed at the dedication of that Temple.

When the Grand Master, or the Deputy Grand Master acting as Grand Master, is present, the Book of Constitutionsshouldbe borne before him by the Masterofthe oldest lodge (or the Senior Past Master), and it must never be borne in procession except before the Grand Master or Deputy acting as such. On entering public buildings, the Bible, Square and Compasses and the Book of Constitutions should be placed in front of the Grand Master. When the Grand Master, or the Deputy, joins a lodge procession, he should be placed immediately in front of the Master and Wardens, and two Deacons and a Sword Bearer should be appointed to attend him: a Grand Warden should be assigned the sarne position and be attended by two Deacons: but if such Grand Officer has charge of the ceremonies, he should be posted immediately in the rear of the Master. These forms of processions may be used by the Grand, or a subordinate lodge, on all public occasions, for which a form is not specially laid down. It should be remembered, that all Masonic processions are under the strict discipline of the lodge room, and, therefore, no one should enter or leave onc without permission of the Master, conveyed through the Marshal or Junior Deacon.

FUNERAL SERVICE. No one below the degree of Master Mason can be buried with, or participate in Masonic funeral ceremonies. None but Master Masons who are members of a lodge or registered by the Grand Lodge, are entitled to Masonic burial, but a lodge may, if it sees fit, bury with Masonic honors an unaffiliated Mason. It is the duty of the lodge of which a Brother is a member, or of the nearest lodge, to\" perform the usual Masonic burial service over deceased Master Masons, when requested so to do by the deceased or his nearest relatives.\" Masonic clothing can be worn at funerals, only when a lodge is present in its organized capacity. A lodge can unite in the funeral procession of a person not a Mason, only as mourners, and not then without the express consent of the Grand Master, or Grand Lodge. When other organizations unite in the burial of a Mason, the lodge after taking charge of the body will conduct the services as if none but Masons were present. The Masonic service must be the final one, except that a religious service at the grave is permissible. Upon the decease of a Mason, the Master of his lodge should ascertain whether the deceased had requested to be buried with Masonic honors, or if such is the wish of his immediate relatives, taking special care not to urge it upon them. If the deceased is a member of a distant lodge, or, of no lodge, but entitled to Masonic burial, the duty devolves upon the oldest lodge in the place where he died, unless some other arrangement is made by those interested. It is the duty of the Master to see that suitable bearers are provided, but in this, as well as other respects, he should consult with the friends of the deceased. The Marshal should make himself familiar with the route the lodge will take and with the location of the grave and the approach to it, in order that he may avoid confusion and be prompt in the movement of the procession. If the deceased was a Grand or Past Grand Officer, the Grand Master Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (60 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"should be promptly notified, in order that he may convene the Grand Lodge, if he sees fit, and be present himself: in such case, the Grand Master, or, in his absence, his representative, will conduct the burial service. A special communication of the lodge should be opened, after which the brethren proceed to the place where the service is to be held. The brethren should be dressed, with as much uniformity as practicable in dark clothes, with white gloves and aprons, the Officers and Past Masters wearing theirjewels: black crape should be worn on the left arm, above the elbow, and a sprig of evergreen on the left breast; and the insignia of the officers should be trimmed with black crape tied with a white ribbon; and a white lambskin apron should be placed upon the coffin. The masonic procession, upon arriving at a proper distance from the grave, should countermarch, and approach it in two lines in open order, passing from the foot to the head, where the Master takes his position, with the Chaplain on his left. Each line should form somewhat in the shape of a half circle, extending from the Master beyond the foot of the grave far enough to give room for the mourners always, and, if the nature of the ground allows and the attendance is large enough to require it, as far as the services can be heard with convenience. If it is impracticable for the brethren to form in a single line within convenient distance, other lines may be formed in the rear of the first. The mourners take their places inside the circle at the foot of the grave, and the bearers on each side of it: the Deacons cross their rods over the head and the Stewards over the foot, and retain their places throughout the service. If the body is to be placed in a tomb, the coffin should be deposited a little in front of it and remain there until the ceremonies are finished: and the brethren form around the coffin in the same manner as around the grave. The custom of burying a brother with masonic honors is ancient, but it has not been ascertained when it originated: the early Constitutions do not mention it, but in 1742 a caricature of a Masonic funeral procession was published, and in 1754 aregulation was adopted restraining the custom. A Service was first published in 1772 by WILLIAM PRESTON, in his \"Illustrations of Masonry.\" MASONIC FUNERAL SERVICE. Chaplin:I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills; from whence cometh my help?

The Committee offers the following brief and simple ritual as a suggested Memorial Service to be held on the evening before a funeral for a deceased Brother. The directions governing the Officers and Brethren of the Lodge at a Masonic Memorial Service shall be those directions provided in the Maine Masonic Text Book, found in the chapter on \"Funeral Service,\" that would apply to this Memoria] Service. Where the room is limited when this service is conducted we suggest the Master take his position at the head and the Chaplain atthe foot of the casket; the Deacons with crossed rods at the head and the Stewards with crossed rods at the foot, retaining their places throughout the Memorial Service; the assembled Brethren remain in their seats until the conclusion of the service. The Brethren will deposit their Evergreen in the usual manner at the conclusion of the Service. On those occasions when the Lodge is requested to participate in the funeral of a Brother, if the Master so desires, this Memorial Service may be substituted for thc regular Masonic Funeral Service. We submit a brief Committal Service to be used at the grave if desired. The Ritual for Masonic Memorial Service is as follows: MASONIC MEMORIAL SERVICE Master: Friends and Brethren, we who are Masons have assembled on this occasion to express our respect and esteem for our Brother who has passed beyond our mortal sight and to share with those near and dear to him our belief in the immortality of the soul.

It used the tools of the builder's trade as emblems and symbols to teach Masons how to build character and moral stature. It teaches service toGod, to a Brother, to all mankind. It seeks constantly to build the temple of the soul and thus to fit Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/BlueBook1.htm (66 of 76) [11/22/1999 11:51:56 AM]"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"us for that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

Masons believe sincerely that when life on earth comes to a close, the soul is translated from the imperfections of this mortal sphere to that allperfect glorious and celestial Lodge above, where God, the Grand Architect of the universe, presides. With these truths and convictions our Brother was well acquainted. Though perfection of character is not of this world, yet we are persuaded that our Brother sought to live by these truths and principles of Masonry; that they sustained and supported him; and that by them his life was made richer, fuller and more meaningful. (Here the Master or Secretary of the Lodge should give the Masonic biography of the Brother When and in what Lodge he was made a Master Mason; what offices, if any, he has held; any special committee service he has rendered; such other items of Masonic interest available. This biographical data is especially recommended when this service is used strictly as a Memorial Service.) Master When our Brother labored with us in Masonic attire, he wore a white apron which he was taught is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason. By it he was constantly reminded of that purity of life and that rectitude of conduct so necessary to his gaining admission into that Celestial Lodge above. He will now wear that apron forever as the emblem of the virtues it represents.* The Evergreen is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. By it we are reminded of the immortal soul of man which survives the grave and which will never, never die. In accordance with our custom, I now place this Evergreen over the heart of our Brother.* And now to you who shared with our Brother the intimate ties of family and friendship, we tender our affectionate sympathy. Our hearts respond to your hearts in your grief. We trust that these affirmations of faith, in which our Brother shared, may speak to you and inspire you to live with hope and courage. We ask you always to remember that the God and Father of us all is a Loving God, a Compassionate God whose ears are ever open to the cry of the afflicted. Let us pray.

Amen. * (The Master concluding his statement explaining the APRON, holding it by the two upper comers with the flap toward himself, will place the Apron over the edge of the casket, allowing the strings to fall within the casket. In depositing the Evergreen, the MASTER brings his right hand to his left breast; then extends it, palm downward, over the casket depositing the Evergreen, then carries it above his head pointing to Heaven, and then drops arm and hand to his side. ) At the conclusion of the service the other Officers and Brethren will approach the casket and deposit their Evergreen in like manner.)

CHAPTER X. INSTALLATION OF GRAND OFFICERS. A Grand Master may be installed by a Present or Past Grand Master of the same or another jurisdiction: if it is not practicable to have the ceremony performed by one of that rank, the Senior Past Master present may act himself, or call to the chair some Past Grand Officer to act under his direction. In some jurisdictions, at the installation of a Grand Master, a ceremony, corresponding to the \"Past Master's Degree\" and called the \"Past Grand Master's Degree,\" is required. It is, however, a recent invention, and never has been practiced in this or our mother Grand Lodge. When the Grand Master has been installed, he installs the other Grand officers himself, or, if he sees fit, causes them to be installed by another, who acts merely as the mouthpiece of the Grand Master. At the appointed hour, the Installing Officer takes the chair, calls to order, announces the business before the Grand Lodge, and appoints some competent Brother to act as Grand Marshal . If the retiring Grand Master is not officiating, he may be requested (instead of the Grand Marshal) to present his successor. By direction of the Installing Officer, the Grand Marshal collects the jewels and insignia of office, and the Grand Secretary reads a lisging of the officers elected.

By immemorial usage and the irrevocable landmarks of Masonry, you are invested, as Grand Master of Masons, with powers and prerogatives which are well nigh absolute. The interests of the Craft, for weal or woe, are placed in your hands during your term of office. The good resolutions which, I doubt not, you have formed in your own mind, that these powers shall not be abused or perverted by you, I would gladly strengthen by a word of admonition, which it will not become me henceforth to utter. The very consciousness of the possession of a great power will ever make a generous mind cautious and gentle in its exercise. To rule has been the lot of many, and requires neither strength of intellect or soundness ofjudgment; to rule well has been the fortune of but few, and may well be the object of an honorable ambition. It is not by the strong arm or the iron will, that obedience and order, the chief requisites of good government, are secured,but by holding the key to the hearts of men. The office of Grand Master is of great antiquity and respect, and is one of the highest dignities to which we may aspire. Its incumbent, to rule well, should possess and practice several important requisites. As a man, he should be of approved integrity and irreproachable morals; freed from the dominion of hasty temper and illgoverned passions; of good repute in the world; and practicing, as an example to the Craft, the cardinal virtues of Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance and Justice. As a citizen, he should be loyal to his government, obedient toiL, laws, prompt in the duties he owes to society, and a pattern of fidelity in all social and domestic relations. As a Mason, he should cling to the old landmarks, and be sternly opposed to their infringement; be proficient in the laws, language and literature of the Fraternity; be desirous to learn and apt to teach; though not for the time a workman, yet be master of the work and qualified to earn his wages; be prompt to aid and relieve, and slow to demand it; be ever mindful, that though elevated for a time above his fellows, that he is elevated by them, and that he is yet a Craftsman, more sacredly bound by a Craftsman's obligation; and that he should cultivate everywhere, and at all times, the golden tenets of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.

If the building be intended for Masonic purposes, the address will be varied according to circumstances. Grand Master. From time immemorial it has been the custom of the Ancient and Honorable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons to lay, when requested so to do, with their ancient forms, the corner stone of buildings erected for the worship of God, for charitable objects, or Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (22 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:52 AM]"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"for the purposes of the administration of justice and free government, and of no other buildings. This corner stone, therefore, we may lay in accordance with our law, and gladly do so, testifying thereby our obedience to the law and our desire to show publicly our respect for the government under which we live. The Grand Master then calls up the lodge, remarking: Grand Master The first duty of masons, in any undertaking, is to invoke the blessing of the Great Architect upon their work. Let us pray.

Grand Master The Grand Treasurer will now deposit, in the corner stone, the memorials prepared for that purpose, the list of which the Grand Secretary will first read. The Grand Secretary reads the list, whereupon the Grand Treasurer deposits the box, the Grand Lodge standing, and the band playing. The Grand Master then spreads the cement on the foundation, and the stone is lowered to its place, with solemn music. The Grand Lodge is seated.

The Grand Chaplain pronounces the Benediction, and the procession reforms and returns to the Hall, where the Grand Lodge is closed. MISCELLANEOUS. Form. When masonic services are performed by the Grand Master, they are said to be done in ample form: if by a Deputy, in due form: and if by any other person, in form. Summons, and Notice or Notification. Formerly, (and now in some jurisdictions) these terms were used synonymously; but in this State there is a wide difference in their signification’s. A Notice or Notification is used to give information, and the obligation to respond to it is the general Masonic obligation only: and the party, receiving it, is himself the judge whether, under the circumstances, it is his duty to respond. A Summons is an order, and the Brother receiving it is under a special and imperative obligation to obey it: disobedience to it is a Masonic crime of a high grade; and failure to obey it can be justified only by a necessity, beyond the power of the party to overcome. Clothing. The Apron of a Master Mason should be a plain white lambskin, fourteen inches wide by twelve inches deep. It may have sky blue lining and edging, and it may have three rosettes of the same color. No other color is allowable and no other ornament should be worn, except that Officers and Past Officers may have the emblems of their offices, in silver or blue, on the Apron, or (by the express provisions of our constitution), may have \"figured Aprons.\" Formerly, an officer of a lodge was required to wear a blue sash: and, according to ancient usage, a sash is a part of the clothing of an officer, but, in this State, he may wear one or not, as he sees fit: it is recommended that Marshals wear them, whether the other officers do or not.

JURISPRUDENCE AND DIGEST SOURCES OF MASONIC LAW. The law by which the Institution is governed is derived from the following sources: 1. The Ancient Landmarks. 2. The Ancient Charges. 3. The Old Regulations. 4. The Constitution of our Grand Lodge. 5. The Regulations and decisions of our Grand Lodge. 6. The usages and customs of the Fraternity. 7. The ByLaws of the Lodge. These classes in some instances run into each other; but this classification appears to be the most simple and convenient that can be made. Various attempts have been made to enumerate the Landmarks: but as no two authors agree in their enumeration, it is safe to conclude that no one of the attempts is a success. The very definition of Landmarks shows that an enumeration of them is scarcely possible. A Landmark is a law or custom of the Fraternity, that has existed \"from a time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary. If a Landmark was originally enacted as a law the time when, as well as the fact of the enactment, are not known. All we can know is that it is a law or a custom that has existed from time immemorial. We may be making landmarks now: if any universal usage exists that has existed so long that its origin is unknown, it is a landmark. It has been said that the Landmarks are the unwritten law of Masonry: but this is not correct: for landmarks are found in the Ancient Charges. Indeed, the only evidence, that some customs are landmarks, is the fact that they are mentioned as such in the earliest publications in relation to Freemasonry. The Landmarks cannot be repealed or changed. That they are sometimes infringed upon, is doubtless true. But any enactment in violation of a landmark is void, by whatever authority it is made. All Masons agree in this: and the practical difficulty is, that one denies that to be a landmark which another affirms is one. In order that The Ancient Landmarks, The Ancient Charges and The Old Regulations may be accessible to all, they will be given in the succeeding Chapters. The law derived from the Constitution, Regulations and Decisions of the Grand Lodge, will be given only in the Digest. Nor will any attempt be made to enumerate the usages and customs of the Fraternity, save in Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (28 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"special cases: and of course, ByLaws of Lodges need not be herein discussed. CHAPTER XIV . MACKEY'S ANCIENT LANDMARKS. (From Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry.) Until the year 1858, no attempt had been made by any Masonic writer to distinctly enumerate the landmarks of Freemasonry, and to give to them a comprehensible form. In October of that year, the author of this work published in the American Quarterly Review of Freemasonry (vol. ii, p.230), an article on \" The Foundations of Masonic Law,\" which contained a distinct enumeration of the landmarks, which was the first time that such a list had been presented to the Fraternity. This enumeration was subsequently incorporated by the author in his Text Book of Masonic Jurisprudence. It has since been very generally adopted by the Fraternity, and republished by many writers on Masonic law; sometimes without any acknowledgement of the source whence they derived their information. According to this recapitulation, the result of much labor and research, the landmarks are twentyfive in number, and are as follows: 1 . The modes of recognition are, of all the landmarks the most legitimate and unquestioned. They admit of no variation; and if ever they have suffered alteration or addition the evil of such a violation of the ancient law has always made itself subsequently manifest. 2. The division of symbolic Masonry into three degrees is a landmark that has been better preserved than almost any other; although even here the mischievous spirit of innovation has left its traces, and, by the disruption of its concluding portion from the third degree, a want of uniformity has been created in respect to the final teaching of the Master's Order; and the Royal Arch of England, Scotland, Ireland, and America, and the \"high degrees\" of France and Germany, are all made to differ in the mode in which they lead the neophyte to the great consummation of all symbolic Masonry. In 1813, the Grand Lodge of England vindicated the ancient landmark, by solemnly enacting that ancient Craft Masonry consisted of the three degrees, of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, including the Holy Royal Arch. But the disruption has never been healed, and the landmark, although acknowledged in its integrity by all, still continues to be violated. 3. The legend of the third degree is an important landmark, the integrity of which has been well preserved. There is no rite of Masonry, practiced in any country or language, in which the essential elements of this legend are not taught The lectures may vary, and indeed are constantly changing, but the legend has ever remained substantially the same. And it is necessary that it should be so, for the legend of the Temple Builder constitutes the very essence and identity of Masonry. Any rite which should exclude it, or materially alter it, would at once, by that exclusion or alteration, cease to be a Masonic rite. 4. The government of the Fraternity by a presiding officer called a Grand Master, who is elected from the body of the Craft, is a fourth landmark of the Order. Many persons suppose that the election Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (29 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"of the Grand Master is held in consequence of a law or regulation of the Grand Lodge. Such, however, is not the case. The office is indebted for its existence to a landmark of the Order. Grand Masters, or persons performing the functions under a different but equivalent title, are to be found in the records of the Institution long before Grand Lodges were established; and if the present system of legislative government by Grand Lodges were to be abolished, a Grand Master would still be necessary. 5. The prerogative of the Grand Master to preside over every assembly of the Craft, wheresoever and whensoever held, is a fifth landmark. It is in consequence of this law, derived from ancient usage, and not from any special enactment, that the Grand Master assumes the chair, or as it is called in England, \"the throne,\" at every communication of the Grand Lodge; and that he is also entitled to preside at the communication of every subordinate Lodge, where he may happen to be present. 6. The prerogative of the Grand Master to grant dispensations for conferring degrees at irregular times, is another and a very important landmark. The statutory law of Masonry requires a month, or other determinate period, to elapse between the presentation of a petition and the election of a candidate. But the Grand Master has the power to set aside or dispense with this probation, and to allow a candidate to be initiated at once. This prerogative he possessed before the enactment of the law requiring a probation, and as no statute can impair his prerogative, he still retains the power. 7. The prerogative of the Grand Master to give dispensations for opening and holding Lodges is another landmark. He may grant, in virtue of this, to a sufficient number of Masons, the privilege of meeting together and conferring degrees. The Lodges thus established are called\" Lodges under dispensation.\" 8. The prerogative of the Grand Master to make Masons at sight is a landmark which is closely connected with the preceding one. There has been much misapprehension in relation to this landmark, which misapprehension has sometimes led to a denial of its existence in jurisdictions where the Grand Master was, perhaps, at the very time substantially exercising the prerogative, without the slightest remark or opposition. 9 . The necessity for Masons to congregate in Lodges is another landmark. It is not to be understood by this that any ancient landmark has directed that permanent organization of subordinate Lodges which constitutes one of the features of the Masonic system as it now prevails. But the landmarks of the Order always prescribed that Masons should, from time to time, congregate together for the purpose of either Operative or Speculative labor, and that these congregations should be called Lodges. Formerly, these were extemporary meetings called together for special purposes, and then dissolved, the brethren departing to meet again at other times and other places, according to the necessity of circumstances. But warrants of constitution, bylaws, permanent officers, and annual arrears are modern innovations wholly outside the landmarks, and dependent entirely on the special enactments of a comparatively recent period. 10 . The government of the Craft, when so congregated in a Lodge, by a Master and two Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (30 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Wardens, is also a landmark. A congregation of Masons meeting together under any other government, as that, for instance, of a president and vice president, or a chairman and subchairman, would not be recognized as a Lodge. The presence of a Master and two wardens is as essential to the valid organization of a Lodge as a Warrant of constitution is at the present day. The names, of course, vary in different languages; but the officers, their number, prerogatives, and duties are everywhere identical. 11 . The necessity that every Lodge, when congregated should be duly tiled, is an important landmark of the Institution which is never neglected. The necessity of this law arises from the esoteric character of Masonry. The duty of guarding the door, and keeping off cowans and eavesdroppers, is an ancient one, which therefore constitutes a landmark. 12. The right of every Mason to be represented in all general meetings of the Craft, and to instruct his representative, is a twelfth landmark. Formerly these general meetings, which were usually held once a year, were called \"General Assemblies\" and all the Fraternity, even to the youngest Entered Apprentice, were permitted to he present. Now they are called \"Grand Lodges,\" and only the Masters and Wardens of the subordinate Lodges are summoned. But this is simply as the representatives of their members. Originally, each Mason represented himself; now he is represented by his officers. 13. The right of every Mason to appeal from the decision of his brethren, in Lodge convened, to the Grand Lodge or General Assembly of Masons, is a landmark highly essential to the preservation of justice, and the prevention of Oppression. A few modem Grand Lodges in adopting a regulation that the decision of subordinate Lodges, in cases of expulsion cannot be wholly set aside upon an appeal, have violated this unquestioned landmark, as well as the principles of just government. 14. The right of every Mason to visit and sit in every regular Lodge is an unquestionable landmark of the Order. This is called \"the right of visitation\". This right of visitation has always been recognized as an inherent right which inures to every Mason as he travels through the world. And is because Lodges are justly considered as only divisions for convenience of the universal Masonic family. This right may, of course, he impaired or forfeited on special Occasions by various circumstances; but when admission is refused to a Mason in good standing, who knocks at the door of a Lodge as a visitor, it is to he expected that some good and sufficient reason shall be furnished for this violation of what is, in general a Masonic right, founded on the landmarks of the Order. 15. It is a landmark of the Order, that no visitor unknown to the brethren present, or to someone of them as a Mason, can enter a Lodge without first passing an examination according to ancient usage. Of course, if the visitor is known to any brother present to he a Mason in good standing, and if that brother will vouch for his qualifications, the examination may be dispensed with, as the landmark refers only to the cases of strangers, who are not to he recognized unless after strict trial, due examination, or lawful information. 16. No Lodge can interfere in the business of another Lodge, nor give degrees to brethren who are members of other Lodges. This is undoubtedly an ancient landmark, founded on the great principles of courtesy and fraternal kindness, which are at the very foundation of our Institution. It has been repeatedly recognized by subsequent statutory enactments of all Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (31 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Grand Lodges. 17. It is a landmark that every Freemason is amenable to the laws and regulations of the Masonic jurisdiction in which he resides, and this although he may not be a member of any Lodge. Nonaffiliation, which is, in fact, in itself a Masonic offence, does not exempt a Mason from Masonic jurisdiction. 18. Certain qualifications of candidates for initiation arc derived from a landmark for the Order. These qualifications are that he shall be a man unmutilated, free born, and of mature age. That is to say, a woman, a cripple, or a slave, or one born in slavery, is disqualified for initiation into the rites of Masonry. Statutes, it is true, have from time to time been enacted, enforcing or explaining these principles; but the qualifications really arise from the very nature of the Masonic institution, and from its symbolic teachings, and have always existed as landmarks. 19. A belief in the existence of God as the Grand Architect of the Universe, is one of the most important landmarks of the Order. It has been always admitted that a denial of the existence of a Supreme and Superintending Power is an absolute disqualification for initiation. The annals of the Order never yet have furnished or could furnish an instance in which an avowed Atheist was ever made a Mason.. The very initiatory ceremonies of the first degree forbid and prevent the possibility of such an Occurrence. 20 . Subsidiary to this belief in God, as a landmark of the Order, is the belief in a resurrection to a future life. This landmark is not so positively impressed on the candidate by exact words as the preceding; but the doctrine is taught by very plain implication, and runs through the whole symbolism of the Order. To believe in Masonry, and not to believe in a resurrection, would be an absurd anomaly, which should only be excused by the reflection, that he who thus confounded his belief and his skepticism was so ignorant of the meaning of both theories as to have no rational foundation for his knowledge of either. 21. It is a landmark that a \"Book of the Law\" shall constitute an indispensable part of the furniture of every Lodge. I say, advisedly, Book of the Law, because it is not absolutely required that everywhere the Old and New Testaments shall be used. The \"Book of the Law\" is that volume which, by the religion of the country, is believed to contain the revealed will of the Grand Architect of the Universe. Hence, in all Lodges in Christian countries, the \"Book of the Law\" is composed of the Old and New Testaments, in a country where Judaism was the prevailing faith, the Old Testament alone would be sufficient; and in Mohammendan countries, and among Mohammendan Masons, the Koran might be substituted. Masonry does not attempt to interfere with the peculiar religious faith of its disciples, except so far as relates to the belief in the existence of God, and what necessarily results from that belief. The \"Book of Law\" is to the Speculative Mason his spiritual trestleboard; without this he cannot labor; whatever he believes to be the revealed will of the Grand Architect constitutes for him this spiritual trestleboard and must ever be before him in his hours of speculative labor, to be the rule and guide of his conduct The landmark, therefore, requires that a \"Book of the Law,\" a religious code of some kind, purporting to be an exemplar of the revealed will of God, shall form an essential part of the furniture of every Lodge. Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (32 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"22 . The equality of all Masons is another landmark of the Order. This equality has no reference to any subversion of those graduations of rank which have been instituted by the usages of society. The monarch, the nobleman, or the gentleman is entitled to all the influence, and receives all the respect, which rightly belong to his position. But the doctrine of Masonic equality implies that, as children of one great Father, we meet in the Lodge upon the levelthat on that level we are all traveling to one predestined goalthat in the Lodge genuine merit shall receive more respect than boundless wealth, and that virtue and knowledge alone should be the basis of all Masonic honors, and be rewarded with preferment. When the labors of the Lodge are over, and the brethren have retired from their peaceful retreat, to mingle once more with the world, each will then again resume that social position, and exercise the privileges of that rank, to which the customs of society entitle him. 23. The secrecy of the Institution is another and most important landmark. The form of secrecy is a form inherent in it, existing with it from its very foundation, and secured to it by its ancient landmarks. If divested of its secret character, it would lose its identity, and would cease to be Freemasonry. What ever objections may, therefore, be made to the Institution on account of its secrecy, and however much some unskillful brethren have been unwilling in times of trial, for the sake of expediency, to divest it of its secret character, it will be ever impossible to do so, even where the landmark not standing before us as an insurmountable obstacle; because such change of its character would be social suicide, and the death of the Order would follow its legalized exposure. Freemasonry, as a secret association has lived unchanged for centuries; as an open society, ii would not last for as many years. 24 . The foundation of a speculative science upon an operative art, and the symbolic use and explanation of the terms of that art, for the purposes of religious or moral teaching constitute another landmark of the Order. The Temple of Solomon was the symbolic cradle of the Institution, and therefore, the reference to the Operative masonry which constructed that magnificent edifice, to the materials and implements which were employed in its construction, and to the artists who were engaged in the building, are all component and essential parts of the body of Freemasonry, which could not be subtracted from it without an entire destruction of the whole identity of the Order. Hence, all the comparatively modern rite of Masonry, however they may differ in other respects, religiously preserve this Temple history and these operative elements, as the substratum of all their modifications of the Masonic system. 25. The last and crowning landmark of all is that these landmarks can never be changed. Nothing can be subtracted from themnothing can be added to them ,not the slightest modifications can he made in them. As they were received from our predecessors, we are bound by the most solemn obligations of duty to transmit them to our successors. CHAPTER XVI THE ANCIENT CHARGES. The collection generally known as \"The Ancient Charges\" is the one presented to the Grand Lodge of England in 1721, approved by it in 1722, and published in 1723, in \"Anderson's Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (33 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Constitutions.\" By most, these charges are esteemed to be landmarks, and they certainly come within the definition of the term. They are six in number, and set forth in general terms the principles of Masonry and the obligations of a Mason in respect to God and Religion, to the Civil Magistrate, to the Lodge, to those in official position, to the Craft, to the family and to the community. I. CONCERNING GOD AND RELIGION. A Mason is obliged, by his tenure, to obey the moral law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist nor an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancient times Masons were charged in every country to be of the Religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, it is now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves; that is, to be good men and true, or men of honor and honesty, by whatever denominations or persuasions they may be distinguished; whereby Masonry becomes the Centre of Union, and the means of conciliating true Friendship among persons that must have remained at a perpetual distance. A belief in God, the Creator and Father, is indispensably requisite in a candidate for the honors of Masonry. An attempt has been made in France to modify this Landmark: it has not succeeded; and when any Body, calling itself masonic, adopts any other rule, it thereby and at once puts itself outside the pale of Masonry. Attempts have also been made in the opposite direction. In Prussia, Israelites have been excluded. This is equally a violation of the landmark: while a belief in the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man is absolutely essential, any additional requirements are innovations. But, of course, if it is known that a candidate's religious belief is such that he cannot conform to our laws, he should never be admitted. II. OF THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE, SUPREME AND SUBORDINATE. A Mason is a peaceable subject to the civil powers wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in plots and conspiracies against the peace and welfare of the nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior magistrates; for as Masonry hath been always injured by war, bloodshed and confusion, so ancient kings and princes have been much disposed to encourage the Craftsmen because of their peaceableness and loyalty, whereby they practically answered the cavils of their adversaries, and promoted the honor of the Fraternity, who ever flourished in times of peace. So that if a Brother should be a rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanced in his rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man; and, if convicted of no other crime, though the loyal brotherhood must and ought to disown his rebellion1 and give no umbrage or ground of political jealousy to the government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the lodge, and his relation to it remains indefeasible. The laws of Masonry are subordinate to the civil law. Whenever one's duties as a Mason conflict with his duties as a citizen, the latter are paramount and the former must yield. So well is this understood and practiced, that the enemies of the institution have been able to Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (34 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"discover, in all its history, but one or two instances in which this principle has been violated. A Mason is justified, under this charge, in obeying and sustaining the government actually existing and exercising its powers, without being obliged to determine whether that government is the lawful and rightful one. III.OF LODGES. A Lodge is a place where Masons assemble and work: Hence that Assembly, or duly organized Society of Masons, is called a Lodge, and every brother ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its byLaws and the General Regulations. It is either particular or general, and will be best understood by attending it, and by the Regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annexed. In ancient times, no Master or Fellow could be absent from it, especially when warned to appear at it, without incurring a severe censure, until it appeared to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hindered him. The persons admitted members of a lodge must be good and true men free born and of mature and discreet age, no bondmen, no women, no immoral or scandalous men, but of good report. The duty of affiliation is herein enjoined. But as the language is, \"every Brother ought to belong\" to a lodge, and not\" every Brother must belong\" to one, it is clear that while affiliation is made duty, it is not made a necessity, and, therefore, a Mason, not a member of a lodge, may be in good standing and entitled to recognition. It follows, that those Grand Lodges, which make membership necessary for recognition as a Mason, have undertaken to modify this \"Ancient Charge.\" The regulations of the Grand Lodge of Maine avoid this, and thc question whether it has undertaken to change a landmark does not arise. The Grand Lodge of England has also changed the word \"freeborn\" to \"freeman.\" In so doing, it has undertaken to change a landmark, according to the general opinion in this country. IV. OF MASTERS, WARDENS, FELLOWS, AND APPRENTICES. All preferment among Masons is grounded upon real worth and personal merit only; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to shame, nor the Royal Craft despised: Therefore no Master or Warden is chosen by seniority, but for his merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every Brother must attend in his place, and learn them in a way peculiar to this Fraternity: Only candidates may know, that no Master should take an Apprentice, unless he has sufficient employment for him, and unless he be a perfect youth, having no maim or defect in his body, that may render him incapable of learning the art of serving his Master's Lord, and of being made a Brother, and then a Fellow Craft in due time, even after he has served such a term of years as the custom of the country directs; and that he should be descended of honest parents; that so, when otherwise qualified, he may arrive to the honor of being the Warden, and then the Master of the lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (35 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Master of all the lodges, according to his merit. No Brother can be a Warden until he his passed the part of a Fellow Craft; nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand Warden until he his been Master of a lodge, nor Grand Master unless he has been a Fellow Craft before his election, who is also to be nobly born, or a gentleman of the best fashion, or some eminent scholar, or some curious architect or other artist, descended of honest parents, and who is of singular great merit in the opinion of the lodges. And for the better, and easier, and more honorable discharge of his office, the Grand Master has a power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular lodge, and has the privilege of acting whatever the Grand Master, his principal, should act, unless the said principal be present or interpose his authority by a letter. These rulers and governorssupreme and subordinate of the ancient lodge, are to be obeyed in their respective stations by all the Brethren, according to the old Charges and Regulations, with all humility, reverence, love and alacrity. In this, \"rotation in office\" and\" promotion in line \" are denounced as unmasonic. This part of this charge is undoubtedly often violated, while its truth is admitted. The idea that an officer, because he has held a certain office, has a claim to promotion is unmasonic in principle and vicious in practice. This charge also involves the question of \"Physical Qualifications\" one that has been much discussed, and in relation to which there is a vast difference of opinion. Some hold to the literal reading that a candidate must \"be a perfect Youth, having no Maim or Defect in his body\": others hold (and such is the law of our Grand Lodge) that the words quoted are modified by those following, and that the capacity of learning the \"art of serving his Master's Lord\" is to be determined, not by what was required in that respect in the days of Operative Masonry, but by what is required now when the Institution has become Speculative only. The reasonable rule seems to be that a candidate, who can do all the work of Masonry, is not physically disqualified. This Charge also teaches that no one can be \"a Master [of a lodge] until he has acted as a Warden\". Our Grand Lodge has enacted the contrary. When our regulation was adopted, many members of the Grand Lodge held that this Charge was a landmark and could not be changed: but others held that it was in the nature of a regulation, which might be modified or repealed. In another respect, this charge has been practically modified by many Grand Lodges. It provides that the Grand Master shall appoint his Deputy: but in most Grand Lodges, that officer is elective. The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, however, and a few others adhere to the old custom. V.OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CRAFT IN WORKING. All Masons shall work honestly on working days, that they may live creditably on holy days; and the time appointed by the law of the land, or confirmed by custom, shall be observed.

The Craftsmen are to avoid all ill language, and to call each other by no disobliging name) but Brother or fellow, and to behave themselves courteously within and without The Master, knowing himself to be able of cunning, shall undertake the Lord's work as reasonable, as possible, and truly dispend his goods as if they were his own; nor to give more wages to any Brother or Apprentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons receiving their wages justly, shall be faithful to the Lord, and honestly finish their work, whether task or journey; nor put the work to task that hath been accustomed to journey. None shall discover envy at the prosperity of a Brother, nor supplant him, or put him out of his work, if he, be capable to finish the same; for no man can finish another's work so much to the Lord's profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the designs and draughts of him that began it. When a Fellow Craftsman is chosen Warden of the work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fellows, shall carefully oversee the work in the Master's absence, to the Lord's profit; and his Brethren shall obey him. All Masons employed shall meekly receive their wages without murmuring or mutiny, and not desert the Master till the work is finished. A younger Brother shall be instructed in working, to prevent spoiling the materials for want of judgment, and for increasing and continuing of Brotherly Love. All the tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge. No laborer shall be employed in the proper work of Masonry; nor shall Free Masons work with those that are not free, without an urgent necessity; nor shall they teach laborers and unaccepted Masons as they should teach a Brother or Fellow. From this Charge is derived the rule that one lodge cannot interfere with work offered to another lodge without its consent. VI. OF BEHAVIOR 1.IN THE LODGE WHILE CONSTITUTED. You are not to hold private committees or separate conversation, without leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinent or unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any brother speaking to the Master. Nor behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn, nor use any unbecoming language upon any pretence whatsoever; but to pay due reverence to your Master, Wardens and Fellows, and put them to worship. If any complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the award and determination of the lodge, who are the proper and competent judges of all such controversies (unless you carry it by appeal to the Grand Lodge), and to whom they ought to be referred, unless a Lord's work be hindered the meanwhile, in which case a particular reference may be made; but you must never go to law about what concerneth Masonry, Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (37 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"without an absolute necessity, apparent to the lodge. An unlimited right of appeal, and the right of the Grand Lodge to try and decide the case for itself, are here recognized. Limitations upon either right are in violation of this charge. II. AFTER THE LODGE IS OVER AND THE BRETHREN NOT GONE. You may enjoy yourselves with innocent mirth, treating one another according to ability, but avoiding all excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his inclination, or hindering him from going when his occasions call him, or doing or saying any thing offensive, or that may forbid an EASY and FREE conversation; for that would blast our harmony, and defeat our laudable purposes. Therefore no private piques or quarrels must be brought within the door of the lodge, far less any quarrels about religion, or nations, or State policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholic religion above mentioned; we are also of all nations, tongues, kindred’s and languages, and are resolved against all politics, as what never yet conduced to the welfare of the lodge, nor ever will. This Charge has been always strictly enjoined and observed; but especially ever since the Reformation in Britain, or the dissent and secession of these nations from the communion of Rome. The enjoyment of social occasions, unfettered by the formality required in a lodge, was a distinctive feature in Masonry of the olden time. It would undoubtedly conduce to its prosperity, if this feature should be revived, within the limits prescribed by our rules. III. WHEN BRETHREN MEET WITHOUT STRANGERS, BUT NOT IN A LODGE FORMED You are to salute one another in a courteous manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other BROTHER, freely giving mutual instruction as shall be thought expedient, without being overseen or overheard, and without encroaching upon each other, or derogating from that respect which is due to any Brother, were he not a Mason: for though all Masons are as Brethren upon the same Level, yet Masonry takes no honor from a man that he had before; nay, rather it adds to his honor, especially if he has deserved well of brotherhood who must give honor to whom it is due and avoid ill manners. IV.IN PRESENCE OF STRANGERS NOT MASONS. You shall be cautious in your words and carriage, that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and sometimes you shall divert a discourse. and manage it prudently for the honor of the Worshipful Fraternity. V.AT HOME AND IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise man, particularly not to let your family, friends and neighbors know the concerns of the lodge, etc., but wisely to consult your own honor, and that of the Ancient Brotherhood, for reasons not to be mentioned here. You must also consult your health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from home, after lodge hours are past; and by avoiding of gluttony or drunkenness, that your families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working. VI.TOWARDS A STRANGE BROTHER Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (38 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"You are cautiously to examine him, in such a method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant false pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and derision, and beware of giving him any hints of knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want, you must relieve him, if you can, or else direct him how he may be relieved. You must employ him some days, or else recommend him to be employed. But you are not charged to do beyond your ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, that is, a good man and true, before any other poor people in the same circumstances. The true rule in regard to relief of the distressed is here given. Each gives according to his ability, without looking to reimbursement. No Mason or lodge can, masonically, make a claim for reimbursement of relief voluntarily given. FINALLY All these Charges you are to observe, and also those that shall be communicated to you in another way; cultivating Brotherly Love, the foundation and capestone, the cement and glory of this ancient Fraternity; avoiding all wrangling and quarreling, all slander and backbiting, nor permitting others to slander any honest Brother, but defending his character, and doing him all good offices, as far as is consistent with your honor and safety, and no farther. And if any of them do you injury, you must apply to your own or his lodge, and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge at the quarterly communication, and from thence to the Annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable conduct of our forefathers in every nation; never taking a legal course but when the case cannot be otherwise decided, and patiently listening to the honest and friendly advice of Master and Fellows, when they would prevent your going to law with strangers, or would excite you to put a speedy period to all lawsuits, that so you may mind the affair of Masonry with the more alacrity and success; but with respect to Brothers or Fellows at law, the Master and Brethren should kindly offer their mediation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the contending Brethren; and if that submission is impracticable, they must, however, carry on their process, or lawsuit, without wrath and rancor (not in the common way), saying or doing nothing which may hinder Brotherly Love, and good offices to he renewed and continued; that all may see the benign influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the beginning of the world, and will do to the end of time. Amen. So mote ii be. In this conclusion, the right of appeal to the Grand Lodge is expressly given to the party complaining, to whom it is denied by the regulations in some jurisdictions. These Charges were collected and published as fixed laws of Masonrylaws that had become so perfectly a part of the Institution, that they were considered as unchangeable landmarks of the Fraternity. It is to be regretted that they have ever been differently regarded. The restless desire for improvement, real or fancied, that characterizes the present age, finds no warrant in the old customs and usages of our Fraternity. The better opinion is, that all attempted modifications of these Ancient Charges are unwarrantable and unlawful innovations, which every installed Master has solemnly declared that no man or body of men has the power to make.

But the Grand Lodge refused its sanction, and the Charges, as originally published, have ever since been accepted as the true version. Those published in 1738 are here given, as there are some additional matters in them which are recognized as correct law. I.CHARGE. CONCERNING GOD AND RELIGION. A Mason is obliged by his tenure, to observe the moral law, as a true Noachida; and if he rightly understands the Craft, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine, nor act against conscience. In ancient times, the Christian Masons were charged to comply with the Christian usages of each country where they traveled or worked: but Masonry being found in all nations, even of divers Religions, they are now only charged to adhere to that Religion in which all men agree (leaving each Brother to his own particular opinions), that is, to he good men and true, men of honor and honesty, by whatever Names, Religions or Persuasions they may be distinguished: for they all agree in the three great articles of Noah, enough to preserve the cement of the lodge. Thus masonry is the centre of their union and the happy means of conciliating persons that otherwise must have remained at a perpetual distance. 11.CHARGE. OF THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE, SUPREME AND SUBORDINATE. A Mason is a peaceable subject, never to be concerned in plots against the State, nor disrespectful to inferior magistrates. Of old, Kings, Princes and States encouraged the Fraternity for their loyalty, who ever flourished most in times of peace. But though a Brother is not to be countenanced in his rebellion against the State; yet if convicted of no other crime, his relation to the lodge remains indefeasible. 111.CHARGE. CONCERNING LODGES. A lodge is a place where Masons meet to work in: hence the assembly, or duly organized Body of Masons, is called a lodge; just as the word church is expressive both of the congregation and of the place of worship. Every Brother should belong to some particular lodge, and cannot be absent without incurring censure, if not necessarily detained. The men made Masons must be freeborn (or no bondmen), of mature age and of good report, hale and sound, not deformed or dismembered at the time of their making. But no woman, no eunuch. When men of quality, eminence, wealth and learning apply to be made, they are to be respectfully accepted, after due examination: for such often prove good lords (or founders) of work, and will not employ cowans when true Masons can be had: they also make the best officers of lodges, and the best designers, to the honor and strength of the 1odge nay, from among them, the Fraternity can have a noble Grand Master. But those Brethren are equally subject to the charges and regulations, except in what more immediately concerns operative Masons.

All preferment among masons is grounded upon real worth and personal merit only, not upon seniority. No Master should take a Prentice that is not the son of honest parents, a perfect youth without maim or defect in his body, and capable of learning the mysteries of the art; that so the lords (or founders) may be well served, and the craft not despised; and that, when of age and expert, he may become an Entered Prentice, or a Free Mason of the lowest degree, and upon his due improvements a Fellow Craft and a Master Mason, capable to undertake a Lord's work. The Wardens are chosen from among the Master Masons, and no Brother can be a Master of a lodge till he has acted as Warden somewhere, except in extraordinary cases; or when a lodge is to he formed where none such can be had: for then three Master Masons, though never Masters nor Wardens of lodges before, may he constituted Master and Wardens of that new lodge. But no number without three Master Masons can form a lodge; and none can be the Grand Master or a Grand Warden who has not acted as the Master of a particular lodge. V.CHARGE. OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CRAFT IN WORKING. All Masons should work hard and honestly on working days, that they may live reputably on holy days; and the working hours appointed by law, or confirmed by custom, shall be observed. A Master Mason only must be the Surveyor or Master of Work, who shall undertake the Lord's work reasonably, shall truly dispend his goods as if they were his own, and shall not give more wages than just to any Fellow or Prentice. The Wardens shall be true both to Master and Fellows, taking care of all things, both within and without the lodge, especially in the Master's absence; and their Brethren shall obey them. The Master and the Masons shall faithfully finish the Lord's work, whether task or journey; nor shall take the work at task which has been accustomed to journey. None shall show envy at a Brother's prosperity, nor supp1ant him or put him out of his work, if capable to finish it All Masons shall meekly receive their wages without murmuring or mutiny, and not desert the Master till the Lord's work is finished: they must avoid ill language, calling each other Brother or Fellow, with much courtesy, both within and without the lodge. They shall instruct a younger Brother to become bright and expert, that the Lord's materials may not be spoiled. But Free and Accepted Masons shall not allow cowans to work with them; nor shall they be employed by cowans without an urgent necessity; and even in that case they must not teach cowans, but must have a separate communication.

VI.CHARGE. CONCERNING MASONS' BEHAVIOR. I. BEHAVIOUR IN THE LODGE BEFORE CLOSING. You must not hold private committees or separate conversation without leave from the Master; nor talk of anything impertinent; nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any Brother speaking to the Chair; nor act ludicrously while the lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn: but you are to pay due reverence to the Master, Wardens and Fellows, and put them to worship. Every Brother found guilty of a fault shall stand to the award of the lodge, unless he appeals to the Grand Lodge; or uses a Lord's work is retarded: for then a particular reference may be made. No private piques, no quarrels about nations, families, religions or politics must be brought within the door of the lodge: for as Masons, we are of the oldest Catholic religion above hinted, and of all nations upon the square, level and plumb; and like our predecessors in all ages, we are reserved against political disputes, as contrary to the peace and welfare of the lodge. II.BEHAVIOUR AFTER THE LODGE IS CLOSED AND THE BRETHREN NOT GONE. You may enjoy yourself with innocent mirth, treating one another according to ability, but avoiding all excess; not forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his own inclination (according to the Old Regulation of King Ahashuerus) nor hindering him from going home when he pleases: for though after lodge hours you are like other men, yet the blame of your excess may be thrown upon the Fraternity, though unjustly. III. BEHAVIOUR AT MEETING WITHOUT STRANGERS, BUT NOT IN A FORMED LODGE. You are to salute one another as you have been or shall be instructed, freely communicating hints of knowledge, but without disclosing secrets, unless to those that have given long proof of their taciturnity and honor: and without derogating from the respect due to any Brother, were he not a Mason: for though all Brothers and Fellows are upon the level, yet Masonry divests no man of the honor due to him before he was made a Mason, or that shall become his due afterwards; nay, rather it adds to his respect, teaching us to give honor to whom it is due, especially to a noble or eminent Brother, whom we should distinguish from all of his rank or station, and serve him readily, according to our ability. IV. BEHAVIOUR IN PRESENCE OF STRANGERS NOT MASONS. You must be cautious in your words, carriage and motions; that so the most penetrating stranger may not be able to discover what is not proper to be intimated: and the impertinent or ensnaring questions, or ignorant discourse of strangers must be prudently managed by Free Masons.

Masons ought to be moral men, as above charged; consequently good husbands, good parents, good sons and good neighbors, not staying too long from home, and avoiding all excess; yet wise men too, for certain reasons known to them. VI. BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS A FOREIGN BROTHER OR STRANGER. You are cautiously to examine him, as prudence shall direct you; that you may not be imposed upon by a pretender, whom you are to reject with derision, and beware of giving him any hints. But if you discover him to be true and faithful, you are to respect him as a Brother; and if in want, you are to relieve him, if you can; or else to direct him how he may be relieved: you must employ him, if you can; or else recommend him to be employed; but you are not charged to do beyond ability. VII. BEHAVIOUR BEHIND A BROTHER'S BACK AS WELL AS BEFORE HIS FACE. Free and Accepted Masons have been ever charged to avoid all slandering and backbiting of a true and faithful Brother, or 'taking disrespectfully of his person or performances; and all malice or unjust resentment: nay, you must not suffer any others to reproach an honest Brother, but shall defend his character as far as is consistent with honor, safety and prudence, though no farther. VII.CHARGE. CONCERNING LAWSUITS . If a Brother do you injury, apply first to your own or his lodge, and if you are not satisfied you may appeal to the Grand Lodge; but you must never take a legal course till the cause cannot be otherwise decided: for if the affair is only between Masons and about Masonry, law suits ought to be prevented by the good advice of prudent Brethren, who are the best referees of such differences. But if that reference is either impracticable or unsuccessful, and the affair must he brought into the Courts of Law or Equity; yet still you must avoid all wrath, malice and rancor in carrying on the suit, not saying nor doing any thing that may hinder either the continuance or the renewal of Brotherly Love and Friendship, which is the glory and cement of this ancient Fraternity; that we may show to all the world the benign influence of Masonry, as all wise, true and faithful Brothers have done from the beginning of time, and will do till architecture shall be dissolved in the general congregation. AMEN! So mote it be. All these charges you are to observe, and also those that shall be communicated unto you in a way that cannot be written. CHAPTER XVII . THE OLD REGULATIONS. \"The Old Regulations\" were first compiled in 1720, approved by the Grand Lodge of England in 1721, and published in 1723 in \"Anderson's Constitutions\". They are therein Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (43 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"distinguished from the \"Ancient Charges\" as being amendable or repealable by the Grand Lodge, while the Charges are given as unalterable and irrepealable law. These Regulations have been changed very materially by every Grand Lodge in the world, but they are considered as in force and binding upon the Craft, except so far as they have been changed or repealed in the particular jurisdiction. I. The Grand Master or his Deputy hath authority and right, not only to be present in any true lodge, but also to preside wherever he is, with the Master of the lodge on his left hand, and to order his Grand Wardens to attend him, who are not to act in particular lodges as Wardens, but in his presence, and at his command; because there the Grand Master may command the Wardens of that lodge, or any other Brethren he pleaseth, to attend and act as his Wardens pro tempore. The last clause is limited to cases in which the Grand Wardens are absent, for when they are present they have the right to act. II. The Master of a particular lodge has the right and authority of congregating the members of his lodge into a Chapter at pleasure, upon any emergency or occurrence, as well as to appoint the time and place of their usual forming; and in case of sickness, death, or necessary absence of the Master, the Senior Warden shall act as Master pro tempore, if no Brother is present who has been Master of that lodge before; for in that case the absent Master's authority reverts to the last Master then present, though he cannot act until the said Senior Warden has once congregated the lodge, or, in his absence, the Junior Warden. (But, in 1723, it was resolved that if the Master is absent the Senior Warden fills the chair; and if the Master vacates his office, the Senior Warden fills it until the next election. This rule has been followed almost universally ever since its adoption: it has been the usage, however, in the older jurisdictions, for Past Masters to preside in the absence of the Master and both Wardens; and such is the law in this State expressly recognized in our Constitution; but in many jurisdictions, Past Masters have no more power to open a lodge and preside therein, than any other member.) III . The Master of each particular lodge, or one of the Wardens, or some other Brother by his order, shall keep a book containing their bylaws, the names of their members, with a list of all the lodges in town, and the usual times and places of their forming, and all their transactions that are proper to be written. This duty is now performed by the Secretary. But it is the duty of the Master to see that the records are properly made up, and that nothing not \"proper to be written\" is entered therein. IV. No lodge shall make more than Five new Brethren at one time, nor any man under the age of twentyfive, who must be also his own master, unless by a Dispensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy. (Our Constitution provides that no more than five degrees shall be conferred at one communication: and that candidates must be twentyone years of age. In other countries, by the dispensation of the Grand Master, candidates under the required age may he admitted, but it is held generally in the United States that this law is not subject to a dispensation.)

No man can be made or admitted a member of a particular lodge, without previous notice one month before given to the said lodge, in order to make due inquiry into the reputation and capacity of the candidate, unless by the dispensation aforesaid. VI. But no man can be entered a Brother in any particular lodge, or admitted to be a member thereof, without the unanimous consent of all the members of that lodge then present when the candidate is proposed, and their consent is formally asked by the Master; and they are to signify their consent or dissent in their own prudent way, either virtually or in form, but with unanimity: Nor is this inherent privilege subject to a dispensation; because the members of a particular lodge are the best judges of it; and if a fractious member should be imposed on them, it might spill their harmony or hinder their freedom; or even break or disperse the lodge, which ought to be avoided by all good and true Brethren. VII. Every new Brother at his making is decently to clothe the lodgethat is, all the Brethren presentand to deposit something for the relief of indigent and decayed Brethren, as the candidate shall think fit to bestow, over and above the small allowance stated by the bylaws of that particular lodge; which charity shall be lodged with the Master or Wardens, or the cashier, if the members think fit to choose one. And the candidate shall also solemnly promise to submit to the Constitutions, the Charges and Regulations, and to such other good Usages as shall be intimated to them in time and place convenience(The initiation fee now takes the place of clothing the lodge and of the deposit for the Charity Fund.) VIII . No set or number of Brethren shall withdraw or separate themselves from the lodge in which they were made Brethren, or were afterwards admitted members, unless the lodge becomes too numerous; nor even then without a dispensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy; and when they are thus separated, they must either immediately join themselves to such other lodge as they shall like best, with the unanimous consent of that other lodge to which they go (as above regulated), or else they must obtain the Grand Master's Warrant to join in forming a new lodge. If any set or number of Masons shall take upon themselves to form a lodge without the Grand Master's Warrant, the regular lodges are not to countenance them, nor own them as fair Brethren and duly formed, nor approve of their acts and deeds; but must treat them as rebels, until they humble themselves, as the Grand Master shall in his prudence direct, and until he approve of them by his Warrant, which must be signified to the other lodges, as the custom is when a new lodge is to be registered in the List of Lodges. ( Now no permission of the Grand Master or Deputy is required in order for a member to dimit, but instead, in many jurisdictions the consent of the lodge is required. This regulation makes affiliation a necessary duty, but does not declare the consequences of ceasing to be a member of a lodge.) IX. But if any Brother so far misbehave himself as to render his lodge uneasy, he shall be twice duly admonished by the Master or Wardens in a formed lodge; and if he will not refrain his imprudence, and obediently submit to the advice of the Brethren, and reform what gives them offense, he shall be dealt with according to the bylaws of that particular lodge, or else in such a manner as the Quarterly Communication shall in their great Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (45 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"prudence think fit; for which a new Regulation may be afterwards made. (Although the first part of this Regulation is nearly obsolete, yet there can be no doubt as to the good effects which would result from its being observed.) X . The majority of every particular lodge, when congregated, shall have the privilege of giving instructions to their Master and Wardens, before the assembling of the Grand Chapter or Lodge, at the three Quarterly Communications hereafter mentioned, and of the Annual Grand Lodge too; because their Masters and Wardens are their representatives, and are supposed to speak their mind. XI. All particular lodges are to observe the same Usages as much as possible; in order to which, and for cultivating a good understanding among Freemasons, some members out of every lodge shall be deputed to visit the other lodges as often as shall be thought convenient. (In an old work, the uniformity in different lodges is said to be\" much owing to visiting Brethren who compare the usages.\" The importance of this can scarcely be over estimated). XII. The Grand Lodge consists of, and is formed by, the Masters and Wardens of all the regular particular lodges upon record, with the Grand Master at their head, and his Deputy on his left hand, and the Grand Wardens in their proper places, and must have a Quarterly Communication about Michaelm as, Christmas, and Ladyday, in some convenient place, as the Grand Master shall appoint, where no Brother shall be present who is not at that time a member thereof, without a dispensation; and while he stays, he shall not be allowed to vote, nor even give his opinion, without leave of the Grand Lodge, asked and given, or unless it be duly asked by the said lodge. All matters are to be determined in the Grand Lodge by a majority of votes, each member having one vote, and the Grand Master having two votes, unless the said lodge leave any particular thing to the determination of the Grand Master for the sake of expedition. (In 1723, it was declared that officers of a lodge cannot be admitted into the Grand Lodge, unless their lodge has been regularly constituted. In 1724, it was provided that all Past Grand Masters, and soon after, that all Past Deputy Grand Masters, and all Past Grand Wardens, should be permanent members of the Grand Lodge. This is now the law in nearly all Grand Lodges. In 1728, it was provided that if an officer of a lodge could not attend the Grand Lodge, he might appoint a proxy: but in this State the power of appointing a proxy is vested in the lodge alone: but see ADDENDA. XIII. At the said Quarterly Communication, all matters that concern the Fraternity in general, or particular lodges, or single Brethren, are quietly, sedately, and maturely to be discoursed of and transacted: Apprentices must not be admitted; Masters and Fellow Craft only here, unless by a dispensation. Here also all differences that cannot be made up and accommodated privately, nor by a particular lodge, are to be seriously considered and decided: And if any Brother thinks himself aggrieved by the decision of this Board, he may appeal to the Annual Grand Lodge next ensuing, and leave his appeal in writing with the Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (46 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Grand Master, or his Deputy, or the Grand Wardens. Here, also, the Master or the Wardens of each particular lodge shall bring and produce a list of such members as have been made, or even admitted, in their particular lodges since the last communication of the Grand Lodge: and there shall be a book kept by the Grand Master or his Deputy, or rather by some Brother whom the Grand Lodge shall appoint for Secretary, wherein shall be recorded all (he lodges, with their usual times and places of forming, and the names of all the members of each lodge, and all the affairs of the Grand Lodge that are proper to be written. They shall also consider of the most prudent and effectual methods of collecting and disposing of what money shall be given to or lodged with them in Charity, towards the relief only of any true Brother fallen into poverty or decay, but of none else: But every particular lodge shall dispose of their own Charity for poor Brethren, according to their own bylaws, until it be agreed by all the lodges (in a new Regulation) to carry in the Charity collected by them to the Grand Lodge, at the Quarterly or Annual Communication, in order to make a common stock of it, for the more handsome relief of poor Brethren They shall also appoint a Treasurer, a Brother of good worldly substance, who shall be a member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his office, and shall be always present, and have power to move to the Grand Lodge anything, especially what concerns his office. To him shall be committed all money raised for Charity, or for any other use of the Grand Lodge, which he shall write down in a book, with the respective ends and uses for which the several sums are intended; and shall expend and disburse the same by such a certain order, signed, as the Grand Lodge shall afterwards agree to in a new Regulation: But he shall not vote in choosing a Grand Master or Wardens, though in every other transaction. As in like manner the Secretary shall be a member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his office, and vote in everything, except in choosing a Grand Master or Wardens. The Treasurer and Secretary shall have each a clerk, who must be a Brother and Fellow Craft, but never must be a member of the Grand Lodge, nor speak without being allowed or desired. The Grand Master, or his Deputy, shall always command the Treasurer and Secretary, with their clerks and books, in order to see how matters go on, and to know what is expedient to be done upon any emergent occasion. Another Brother (who must be a Fellow Craft) should be appointed to look after the door of the Grand Lodge, but shall be no member of it. But these offices may be farther explained by a new Regulation, when the necessity and expediency of them may more appear than at present to the Fraternity. (In 1725, it was provided that a Master of a lodge, with his Wardens and a competent number of the lodge assembled in due form, can make Masters and Fellows at discretion. Before that, the second and third degrees could be conferred only in Grand Lodge, or by dispensation from the Grand Master. And after that time, no one could be an officer of the Grand Lodge unless he was a Master Mason.

The same law prevails in our Grand Lodge as to all the officers, except that one or two have no vote. XIV. If at any Grand Lodge, stated or occasional, quarterly or annual, the Grand Master and his Deputy should be both absent, then the present Master of a lodge, that his been the longest a Free Mason, shall take the chair, and preside as Grand Master pro tempore, and shall be vested with all his power and honor for the time: provided there is no Brother present that has been Grand Master formerly, or Deputy Grand Master; for the last Grand Master present, or else the last Deputy present, should always of right take place in the absence of the present Grand Master and his Deputy. It is said that the statement of the right of the Grand Wardens to preside, was accidentally omitted in copying (this Regulation. This right is now universally recognized. In this State, the Deputy Grand Master, Senior Grand Warden, Junior Grand Warden, Past Grand Masters (according to seniority), Past Deputy Grand Masters (according to seniority), Past Senior Grand Wardens (according to seniority), Past Junior Grand Wardens (according to seniority), and the Senior Past Master (who may waive his right in favor of another Past Master), may preside in Grand Lodge in the absence of the Grand Master and those named before them in this list. Seniority is not now reckoned by the time one has been a Mason, but by the time he first held the office in question; thc military rule is followed.) XV . In the Grand Lodge none can act as Wardens but the Grand Wardens themselves, if present; and, if absent, the Grand Master, or the person who presides in his place, shall order private Wardens to act as Grand Wardens pro tempore, whose places are to be supplied by two Fellow Craft of the same lodge, called forth to act, or sent thither by the particular Master thereof; or if by him omitted, then they shall be called by the Grand Master, that so the Grand Lodge may be always complete. If the Grand Wardens are absent their places are supplied, but under our law the places of the appointees are not filled. In England the custom was that the Senior Past Grand Warden acted in the absence of a Grand Warden. XVI. The Grand Wardens, or any others, are first to advise with the deputy about the affairs of the lodge or of the Brethren, and not to apply to the Grand Master without the knowledge of the deputy, unless he refuse his concurrence in any certain necessary affair; in which case, or in case of any difference between the Deputy and the Grand Wardens, or other Brethren, both parties are to go by concert to the Grand Master, who can easily decide the controversy and make up the difference by virtue of his great authority. The Grand Master should receive no intimation of business concerning Masonry but from his Deputy first, except in such certain cases as his Worship can well judge of: for if the application to the Grand Master be irregular, he can easily order the Grand Wardens, or any other Brethren thus applying, to wait upon his Deputy, who is to prepare the business speedily and to lay it orderly before his Worship.

No Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wardens, Treasurer, Secretary, or whoever acts for them, or in their stead pro tempore. can at the same time be the Master or Warden of a particular lodge; but as soon as any of them has honorably discharged his Grand Office, he returns to that post or station in his particular lodge from which he was called to officiate above. Provision is made for this in our Constitution. XVIII . If the Deputy Grand Master be sick, or necessarily absent, the Grand Master may choose any Fellow Craft he please to be his Deputy pro tempore: But he that is chosen Deputy at the Grand Lodge, and the Grand Wardens too, cannot be discharged without the cause fairly appear to the majority of the Grand Lodge; and the Grand Master, if he is uneasy, may call a Grand Lodge on purpose to lay the cause before them, and to have their advice and concurrence in which case the majority of the Grand Lodge, if they cannot reconcile the Master and his Deputy or his Wardens, are to concur in allowing the Master to discharge his said Deputy or his said Wardens, and to choose another Deputy immediately; and the said Grand Lodge shall choose other Wardens in that case, that harmony and peace may be preserved. A Deputy pro tern. may now be appointed: but neither the Deputy nor a Grand Warden can be removed save for misconduct, and after due trial by the Grand Lodge. In England the old custom was, in the absence of a Grand Officer above Junior Grand Warden, that the officer next in rank took his place, and the Junior Grand Warden's place was filled by the Senior Past Grand Warden. XIX. If the Grand Master should abuse his power, and render himself unworthy of the obedience and subjection of tile lodges, he shall be treated in a way and manner to be agreed upon in a new Regulation; because hitherto the Ancient Fraternity have had no occasion for it, their former Grand Masters having all behaved themselves worthy of that honorable office. The compiler knows of but one instance in which action has been taken in a Grand Lodge looking to the removal of a Grand Master for malfeasance in office: but the matter was arranged so that it was not pressed. XX. The Grand Master, with his Deputy and Wardens, shall (at least once) go round and visit all the lodges about town during his mastership. This duty is now devolved upon District Deputy Grand Masters. XXI. If the Grand Master die during his mastership, or by sickness, or by being beyond sea, or any other way should be rendered incapable of discharging his office, the Deputy, or, in his absence, the Senior Grand Warden, or in his absence, the junior, or, in his absence, any three present Masters of lodges, shall join to congregate the Grand Lodge immediately, to advise together upon that emergency, and to send two of their number to invite the LAST Grand Master to resume his office, which now in course reverts to him; or, if he refuse, then Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (49 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the NEXT LAST, and so backward.

But whether there shall be a Feast for all the Brethren or not, yet the Lodge must meet in some convenient place annually on St. John's Day; or, if it be Sunday, then on the next day, in order to choose every year a new Grand Master, Deputy and Wardens. XXIII . If it be thought expedient, and the Grand Master, with the majority of the Masters and Wardens, agree to hold a Grand Feast, according to the ancient laudable custom of Masons, then the ~ Wardens shall have the care of preparing the tickets, sealed with the Grand Master's seal, of disposing of the tickets, of receiving the money for the tickets, of buying the materials of the Feast, of finding out a proper and convenient place to feast in, and of every other thing that concerns the entertainment. But, that the work may not be too burdensome to the two Grand Wardens, and that all matters may be expeditiously and safely managed, the Grand Master or his Deputy shall have power to nominate and appoint a certain number of Stewards, as his Worship shall think fit, to act in concert with the two Grand Wardens; all things relating to the Feast being decided amongst them by a majority of voices, except the Grand Master or his Deputy interpose by a particular direction or appointment. XXIV. The Wardens and stewards shall in due time wait upon the Grand Master or his Deputy for directions and orders about the premises; but if his Worship and his Deputy are sick, or necessarily absent, they shall call together the Masters and Wardens of lodges to meet on purpose for their advice and orders; or else they may take the matter wholly upon themselves, and do the best they can The Grand Wardens and the Stewards are to account for all the money they receive, or expend, to the Grand Lodge, after dinner, or when the Grand Lodge shall think fit to receive their accounts. If the Grand Master pleases, he may in due time summon all the Masters and Wardens of lodges, to consult with them about ordering the Grand Feast, and about any emergency or accidental thing relating thereunto, that may require advice, or else to take it upon himself altogether.

This committee must meet very early on St. John's Day at the place, even before any persons come with tickets. XXVI . The Grand Master shall appoint two or more t rustee Brethren to be porters or doorkeepers, who are also to be early at the place, for some good reasons, and who are to be at the command of the committee. XVII. The Grand Wardens or the Stewards shall appoint beforehand such a number of Brethren to serve at table as they think fit and proper for that work; and they may advise with the Masters and Wardens of lodges about the most proper persons, if they please, or may take in such by their recommendation; for none are to serve that day but Free and Accepted Masons, that the communication may be free and harmonious. XXVIII. All the members of the Grand Lodge must be at the place long before dinner, with the Grand Master or his Deputy at the head, who shall retire, and form themselves.

Some time after dinner, the Grand Lodge is formed, not in the retirement, but in the presence of all the Brethren, who yet are not members of it, and must not therefore speak until they are desired and allowed. XXXII. If the Grand Master of last year has consented with the Master and Wardens in private, before dinner, to continue for the year ensuing, then one of the Grand Lodge, deputed for that purpose, shall represent to all the Brethren his Worship's good government, etc. And, turning to him, shall, in the name of the Grand Lodge, humbly request him to do the Fraternity the great honor, (if nobly born, if not) the great kindness of continuing to be their Grand Master for the year ensuing. And his Worship declaring his consent by a bow or a speech, as he pleases, the said deputed member of the Grand Lodge shall proclaim him Grand Master, and all the members of the lodge shall salute him in due form. And all the Brethren shall for a few minutes have leave to declare their satisfaction, pleasure and congratulation. XXXlII. But if either the Master and Wardens have not in private, this day before dinner, nor the day before, desired the Past Grand Master (0 continue in the master ship another year; or if he, when desired, has not consented; then The Past Grand Master shall nominate his successor for the year ensuing, who, if unanimously approved by the Grand Lodge, and, if there present, shall be proclaimed, saluted, and congratulated the new Grand Master, as above hinted, and immediately installed by the last Grand Master, according to usage. XXXIV . But if that nomination is not unanimously approved, the new Grand Master shall be chosen immediately by ballot, every Master and Warden writing his man's name, and the last Grand Master writing his man's name too; and the man whose name the last Grand Master shall first take out, casually or by chance, shall be Grand Master for the ensuing year; and, if present, he shall be proclaimed, saluted and congratulated, as above hinted, and forthwith installed by the last Grand Master, according to usage.

When that is over, XXXVIII . The Grand Master or his Deputy, or some Brother appointed by him ,shall harangue all the Brethren, and give them good advice: And, lastly, after some other transactions, that cannot be written in any language, the Brethren may go away or stay longer, as they please. The foregoing sixteen articles are not now in force. Sessions of the Grand Lodge are held almost always, solely for the transaction of business, and it is governed by rules of its own adoption. In some jurisdictions \"Festival Communications\" are held, at which no business is transacted: in others the \"Grand Feast\" is held immediately upon the close of the Annual Communication for the installation of officers. It is to be regretted that the custom of celebrating St. Johns' Days, by the subordinate lodges has fallen into disuse. XXXIX . Every Annual Grand Lodge has an inherent power and authority to make new Regulations, or to alter these, for the real benefit of this ancient Fraternity: Provided, always, that the old Landmarks be carefully preserved, and that such alterations and new Regulations be proposed and agreed to at the third quarterly communication preceding the Annual Grand Feast; and that they be offered also to the perusal of all the Brethren before dinner, in writing, even of the youngest apprentice; the approbation and consent of the majority of all the Brethren present being absolutely necessary to make the same binding and obligatory; which must, after dinner, and after the new Grand Master is installed, be solemnly desired; as it was desired and obtained for these Regulations, when proposed by the Grand Lodge, to about 150 Brethren, on St. John Baptist's Day, 1721. Every grand lodge now provides in what manner changes to its Constitution and General regulations shall be made. CHAPTER XVIII. MASONIC OFFENCES AND PUNISHMENT. Experience has shown that Masons do not always obey the laws of the Institution, and that it sometimes becomes necessary to inflict punishment on that account. 1.MASONIC OFFENCES. Every violation of the laws of Masonry is an offense, for which the Mason committing it may be punished. The Masonic law requires us to obey the moral law; the laws of our Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (53 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"country; the Constitution, Regulations and well established customs of the Fraternity; and to keep our obligations; hence a violation of any of these is a Masonic offense. While Masonry requires a belief in God and obedience to the moral law, in other respects it leaves its members freedom in their religious opinions. Therefore, while it would cutoff a member who does not believe in God or who does not obey the moral law, it takes no notice of ecclesiastical offenses. Also, while it enjoins obedience to the civil law, it will not take cognizance of offenses against the civil law that are of a political character. So treason, the highest offense known to the civil law, cannot be punished as a Masonic offense. There are also certain other offenses against the civil law which are not Masonic crimes; when an act, prohibited by statute, involves no moral turpitude, it cannot ordinarily be punished as a Masonic offense; but when an act is prohibited by statute, as being against good public morals, or as dangerous to the life, health and good order of the community, it is an offense against Masonic law. Nor does Masonry undertake to enforce contracts between its members, or collect debts. It is not an offense, for which a Mason can be punished, to insist upon his legal rights against a brother, even if so doing is against what seems to be justice in a particular case. But if deceit or fraud enters into the transaction, that may be punished; but the distinction must be observed between fraud or deceit and the mere breach of the contract. 11. PENAL JURISDICTION OF THE LODGE. Every Lodge shall have original jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided, to entertain proceedings against a member thereof, and should take cognizance of Masonic offenses committed within their territorial jurisdiction by any brother, except members of lodges having concurrent jurisdiction. Cons. 49(I) See Cons. 46,47,48,49 for exceptions to lodge jurisdiction. III . PROCEDURE. Whenever a brother shall be accused of any offense which, if proved, might subject him to expulsion or suspension from the rights and privileges of Masonry, the proceedings in the premises shall be conducted agreeably to the following rules; 1. The accusation shall be made in writing, with specifications of the offense, under the signature of one or more Master Masons, and delivered to the Master, who shall thereupon summon his Lodge to act upon the accusation.Cons. 49(4)(a) 2 . Specifications in which the offense is alleged must be set out with a reasonable degree of precision and certainty; but the strictness of proceedings in criminal courts of law is not required. The aim must be to ascertain the true facts relevant to, and concerning, the matter of the charges, without going into hearsay, irrelevant or immaterial matters, or such as would be clearly incompetent; and it shall not be permissible to impeach a witness upon such trial, as by allowing another witness to testify that he would not believe him under oath, or that his reputation for truth and veracity is bad. Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (54 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"3. Only one offense can be set out in one specification. If the accused is to be charged with more than one offense, specifications covering each Masonic offense must be separately set forth. 4 . Specifications of charges should not contain statements of law or evidence, but only the facts which it is alleged constitute a Masonic offense, and upon which evidence will be submitted at a hearing thereof. 5 . Each specification should charge that the act complained of was done at a specified time and place; but it is not necessary to prove the time and place precisely as alleged, unless it enters into the identity of, or is an essential element in the offense. For example, an act alleged to have been committed on the first day of February may be shown to have been committed on the first day of January, and the charge be sustained; but if it should be shown that the party became a Mason after the first day of January, the date generally becomes essential, and the charge is not proved. 6. If the charge involves matter not proper to be written, it should be so stated; and the accused, at the time of his arraignment, should be orally informed of the specific facts, to which the trial must be confined. The most frequent defect in specifications of charges is that they are not sufficiently specific. It is not sufficient to allege generally, for instance, that the accused slandered a Brother Mason; but that the name of the Brother slandered must be given, as well as the slanderous words, so that the charge will show on its face whether, if the accused used the words, he was guilty of slander or not. The following form of a charge, and specimens of specifications, are sufficient: To the Worshipful Master, Wardens and Brethren of ________________ Lodge, No ______ of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons: The undersigned, a Master Mason in good standing, hereby charges Brother A.

One E.F., upon due petition for the degree of Masonry, was, on the day of_______ A.D. 19 , duly accepted by______________ Lodge No_______and there afterwards and before his initiation, objection was made thereto by a member of said lodge, whereby said E.F. was declared rejected, and the said AD., at, &c., on, &c., did declare the name of the member who made the objection to the initiation of said E.F. Dated this______ day of______ A.D.19_____ C_______ D ________ If the accused is a Fellow Craft, or an Entered Apprentice, the charge must be varied accordingly. Before the presentation of an accusation against a Brother to his Lodge it is incumbent upon the Master to ascertain if the charge or charges are signed by one or more Master Masons, and that the specifications appear to be sufficient, and allege the commission of a Masonic offense. If the specifications are insufficient in form, he should require them to be amended before presentation to the Lodge. When a Lodge is to be convened to consider the entertainment of charges against a Brother the members of the Lodge shall be notified of the time, place and purpose of the meeting in the usual manner by the Secretary. If the Lodge by a majority vote of its members present determine that the charges require investigation, the accusation and all papers pertaining thereto, shall be forwarded to the Recording Grand Secretary. Cons. 49(4)(b). In the event that the Lodge by a majority vote shall decide that the information covering a charge or charges do not allege a Masonic offense, and that investigation thereof is not required, any other Lodge or any Brother aggrieved at the action taken may appeal the decision to the Grand Master, who may, in his discretion, cause the charge or charges to be transmitted to the Chairman of the Board of Trial Commissioners, and the Board shall Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (57 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"thereafter proceed in the same manner as in an accusation regularly received. Cons. 49(4)(e). Note: It is not incumbent upon a Lodge to give consideration in any way to the guilt or innocence of the accused, nor to hear any evidence to support charges, but merely to determine if a Masonic offense is alleged, and if so, that the same required investigation. Lodges may, by a twothirds vote, refuse to entertain charges presented after a lapse of four years from the time of the commission of the alleged offense, unless the reasons for delay in presenting charges grow out of the absence of the accused from this jurisdiction, the absence of material witnesses or the concealment of the offense.Cons. 49 (4)(k). IV. PENAL JURISDICTION OF THE GRAND LODGE. The trial of charges against a Mason alleging a Masonic offense shall be before a Board of Commissioners of Trials appointed annually by the Grand Master, unless in his discretion he may appoint a special Board of Commissioners. The member first named to a Board of Commissioners shall be the Chairman thereof, and three members shall constitute a quorum. A single Commissioner may take testimony. In the absence of the Chairman at the hearing of any cause, the members present shall elect a Chairman pro tempore. Cons. 49(2). The Grand Master may appoint a Past Master of a Lodge to be styled Judge Advocate, and delegate to him such duties as may be appropriate and in the interest of the Fraternity at the hearing of any cause. Cons. 49(3). V.PROCEDURE COMMISSIONERS OF TRIVALS. Upon receipt by the Chairman of a Board of Commissioners of Trials of an information charging a Mason with unmasonic conduct, he shall cause the accused to be served with an attested copy of the charges, and a summons to appear at a time and place named in said summons, to make such answer to the charges and accusations as he may desire. The summons shall be served upon the accused fourteen days, at least, before the return day thereof. The accused may appear in person, or by filing an answer to the charges in writing.Cons. 49(4)(c). If the residence of the accused be unknown, the Commissioners may proceed to examine the charges and accusation Bx Parte; but if known and out of the State, a summons shall be sent him, by mail or otherwise, thirty days, at least before the time appointed for his appearance before the Board. The service and return thereof shall be according to regulations to be made by the Commissioners, and, when so made, shall be conclusive. Cons. 49 (4)(d). When a member of a Lodge in this jurisdiction shall be convicted by a court of competent Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (58 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"jurisdiction of an offense involving moral turpitude and accusation shall not be made against him therefore in the Lodge, the Grand Master shall prefer an information concerning said conviction and cause the same to be transmitted to the Chairman of the Commissioners of Trials.

A Brother on trial before a Board of Trial Commissioners is entitled to be represented by counsel of his choice, who shall be a member of the Fraternity, and duly authorized by the Commission. Also any Brother duly authorized may appear as counsel in support of, or in opposition to, charges against a Brother during the taking of testimony and in the argument of the cause. Cons. 49(4)(i). No visitors shall be admitted except as counsel or witnesses. Witnesses, if Masons, shall testify on their honor as such. Other witnesses shall be duly sworn before their testimony is taken. Cons. 49 (4)(g).

All testimony taken at a hearing before a Board of Trial Commissioners, or by a single Commissioner when duly authorized shall be reduced to writing, signed by the witness at the conclusion of his testimony, and be preserved as a part of the trial record. A Brother appearing in a proceeding against him for unmasonic conduct must either object to each charge or plead thereto. An objection to a charge is a statement in writing, signed by the accused or by his counsel, and entered of record. Objections may be that the statements of the charge are true, but are not a triable Masonic offense, or that the Lodge had nonjurisdiction to entertain and file the charges. If the information does not state a Masonic offense the objection should be sustained. If the accused does not appear at the trial in person, or by counsel, or file in writing a plea in proper form the Chairman of the Board shall cause a plea of not guilty to be entered in his behalf, and shall appoint some qualified Brother to act for him as counsel, whose duty it shall be to see that the rights of the accused are observed, and his defense, if any, properly made. Provided, however, that if the Brother appointed as counsel for the accused shall determine that only a plea of guilty can be entertained, no trial is necessary.

In case of witness whose testimony is considered material cannot attend a hearing before a Board of Trial Commissioners, or a single Commissioner, a deposition may be taken and admitted as evidence. Reasonable notice of the time and place where a deposition is to be taken shall be given in writing by the person appointed to take the same, and all persons concerned with their counsel may be present.

A Mason expelled by the Grand Lodge of Maine loses his membership in the Order. A Mason suspended by the Grand Lodge of Maine loses absolutely his membership in any Lodge in this jurisdiction in which he holds membership, and his status becomes that of an unaffiliated Mason.

Cons. 57. VI APPEALS. The Grand Lodge shall hear all appeals upon the record as sent up, unless for special reasons it shall determine to hear other testimony; and, according to its immemorial usage, may confirm, modify or reverse the proceedings appealed from, and it may give such final judgment and sentence as it deems just. Cons. 53. VII.TRIAL FOR NONPAYMENT OF DUES. No lodge shall suspend or expel a member from the rights of Masonry for nonpayment of dues. The penalty of such delinquency shall be forfeiture or suspension of membership. The member shall be notified of the charges, and summoned to appear at a time and place to be named in said summons, and make such answer as he may desire.

A brother suspended from membership for nonpayment of dues will be restored by the payment or remission of the amount due at the time of his suspension at any time within three years thereafter but after that time he can be restored only upon his application, after payment or remission of the amount in arrears which shall take the same course as an application for initiation, and if rejected said applicant shall not again petition until six months after the rejection. Cons. 51. VIII.PROCEDURE. Any member, who under the bylaws of his Lodge, is in arrears for dues may be cited to appear and show cause why he should not be suspended from, or deprived of, membership for such neglect. Delinquent members shall be reported by the Secretary to the Lodge at a stated communication and in substantially the following form: To the Worshipful Master, Wardens and Brethren of Maine Masonic Text Book file:///C|/Grand lodge/BlueBook/bluebook2.htm (61 of 65) [11/22/1999 11:52:53 AM]"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Lodge, No of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons: The following brethren, viz: A_______ B ______________ C_______ D _____________ E_______ F __________ are more than_____ months (t time fixe by the bylaws) in arrears of dues.

If the bylaws of a lodge fix no time in which arrears of dues forfeit membership, the form of the charge submitted to the lodge by the secretary must be varied as follows: To the Worshipful Master.

Payment of the dues is, of course, good cause; and for reasons satisfactory to itself, the lodge may remit all or a part of the dues, or give further time for payment; or it may suspend the delinquent from membership, or deprive him of it, as appears for the best interest of the Lodge and the Fraternity. A majority vote of the members present is necessary to suspend from, or deprive a Brother from membership. If action upon the delinquency of a Brother is postponed until a later communication of the lodge the formality of a new notice citing him to appear need not be made, but he should be informally advised of the postponement. Any action suspending from or depriving a Brother of membership in a Lodge, without proper notice having been served upon him, when his address was on file, is void, and it will be the duty of the Master to order his name restored to the rolls, without a petition or vote. The question has been raised whether the delinquent has the right, by a partial payment of the amount overdue, to save forfeiting his membership; and while it has not been decided by the Grand Lodge, the better opinion seems to be that before the filing of the charges in the Lodge he may do so, but afterwards he cannot without the permission thereof. Action as to partial payment of arrearages, however, is wholly within the discretion of the lodge. A Brother suspended or deprived of membership for the nonpayment of dues may appeal to the Grand Lodge, but such appeal is limited to reversing the decision of the lodge on irregular procedure, or for errors in matters of law. Although no case has arisen in this State in which application for a new trial has been made to the Grand Lodge, yet there is no doubt of the power of the Grand Lodge to grant one before the case has been finally decided. Such application would be granted for any cause, on account of which the party, without his own fault, did not have a full trial, such as a failure to obtain the testimony by absence of witnesses, the discovery of new evidence, and the like. IX. PROCEEDINGS FOR NONPAYMENT OF DUES. Under our Constitution, the only penalties for nonpayment of dues are suspension from or deprivation of membership. When the former is inflicted, the Brother is restored by the mere payment or remission of the dues which had accrued at the time of suspension at any time within three years thereafter; but after that time he can be restored only upon his application, after payment or remission of the amount in arrears; which shall take the same course as an application for initiation. When the latter is inflicted, the Brother must pay the arrears of dues before he can apply for membership; upon such payment he can apply for restoration but his petition must take the usual course and he must abide the result of the ballot. Neither of these penalties can he inflicted without giving notice to the delinquent, and an opportunity to be heard. Yet the proceedings are simple. The Secretary makes a statement in writing, which is in the nature of a charge. Sec. 51.

INCORPORATION OF \"TRUSTEES OF THE CHARITY FUND.\" The law of our Grand Lodge forbids the incorporation of Lodges. Yet a Corporation of some kind is necessary when the Lodge desires to own a hall or has a fund, and is convenient for holding the title of its library and the usual furniture and clothing, especially for the purpose of insurance. Therefore, if any Lodge wishes to incorporate its Trustees, either for their Charity Fund or for a Building Fund, please contact the Grand Lodge office. To organize a corporation, legal counsel should be consulted. DIGEST OF DECISIONS GRAND LODGE OF MAINE A.F & A.M. No decisions are included within this edition of the Maine Masonic Text Book.
