G S The origin of the Constantinian Orders, as parts of the Ma - sonic system, is unknown Tradition ascribes their introdtiction to various sources. There is authentic evidence, however, to show that thcy wcrc known and practiced in England, under Masonic auspices, as caily as the year 1788 By the year 1796 they had assumed the form of regular orders with a responsible head and recognized laws What these laws were we do not not know In 1808 a further organization was effected by the adoption of a con - stitution >~ o copy of this document is now known to exist, and we are ignorant of its provisions. It would seem, however, that it provided for the establishment oE a capitulary, which was variously known as ‘Grand Council,” ‘‘CIi•tiiid Chaptcr,” and “1—figh Council,” and this became the gov - erning body. The chief was known as “Grand Master,” and the titles of the other officers followed the terms then employed in the various chancelaries of the chivalric orders of Europe. The meetings of this body were held at the Freemasons’ Tavern in London, and the old niinutes of the same are still extant. The name by which the order was known was “The Illustrious Ordcr of the Red Cross.” The members were divided into two classes, known respectively as the Knights of the Noviciate Cross (or Lesser Cross) and Knights of the Grand Cross. It does not appear that there were any subordinate bodies corresponding to our present conclaves, and noviciates were created by the members of the superior grade at their pleasure, at such times and in such places as best suited their convenience. These investitures or installations seem to have been wholly informal, as no reference is made to a ritual, and probably consisted of nothing more than the simple formula of knighthood. The Grand Cross, however, could only he confeired in the High Cotincil of the Order and after a unanimous election By 1813 the idea of subordinate chapters seems to have been presented, but nothing, so far as the records disclose, was done with respect to their establishment, and the old practice of mdi-. vidual creation of noviciate crosses continuied for many years thereafter. Aspirants for the Grand Cross were required to be regularly proposed, and elected, wlieretipon they were “iii trocluccd and admitted,” and required to “make their oFferings according to ancient ctis’rom ‘‘ ‘What the ceremona of installation was we do not know, but ocir tradition say’s that about this time (1813) the present ritual of the “first point’’ was constructed by Era \\Valler Rodwell Wright, then the chief of the Order, and there is other evidence to show that a ceremony very like that foxy in use was known in 1824 On Tuly 9, 1813, the Duke of Sussex became Grand Master btit the Order seems to have languished tinder his sway’, and for a utnuber of years prior to his death, in 1843, no life is discernible. A few of the Grand Crosses continued to exercise their ancient. prerogative of creating noviciates, and from time to tinie a m~in~ her of distinguished members of the craft wcre receiveti in thi5 manner These Knights Companions, it is asserted, ittet. occa~ sionally at the Crown Tavern, in London, and thus maintained an ostensible organization. It is also claimed that mintites of these meetings were kept, but thus far none have come to light. Thus matters stood in the month of May, 1865, when a few Knights Companions came together and reconstituted the Grand Council and proceeded to reestablish the Order on a new and im - proved basis A constitution was adopted which essentially changed the old methods and introduced a number of grades and dignities that theretofor~ seem to have been unknown. The Grand Council became the supreme governing body, but provision was made for a further body styled the General Grand Conclave. This body was composed of the Grand Imperial Council, the Grand Senate of Sovereigns and Grand College of ‘Viceroys. It met tri - ennially for the despatch of business, but its principal function seems to have been the election and enthronement of the Grand Sovereign. The ancient prerogatives of the Grand Crosses seem"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"S LAWS OW THE C015?ANTDIIAiF 03305 7 to have been abolished and the dignity beanie a simple official grade one degree above that of Sovereign. This constitution forms the fundamental law of the Otder wherever dispersed and is the organic act that was in force when the Grand Imperial Council of the United States of Aiuenca was established at Chicago, Ill, in the year 1872, under the style and title, “Grand Imperial Council of Illinois.” .* * * In the year 1869 the Earl of Bective, then the Grand Sov - ereign of England, coinzmssioned Fm. 3lcLeod Moore an intendant General for the Dominion of Canada, and in February, 1870, he received a further authorization empowering him to introduce the Orders into the United States. This duty was performed and resufted in the organization of several Conclaves in the State of Peiinsrlvama On December 15, 1871, the Orders nere confeired on Fm. J. 3. French. of Chicago, Ill, in Orient Conclave, No•45, at l3loomsburg. Pa, and immediately thereafter he was conimis - stoned an Intendant General for Illinois and other Western States In pursuance of this authority he organized six Conclaves in the State of Illinois during the year 1872 All of these Conclaves were duly chartered by the Grand Imperial Council of England. On 4ugust 30 1872, the representatives of these six conclaves met at the City of Chicago~, Ill, and by virtue of a dispensation from the Grand Sovereign of England authorizing the formation of Independent Grand Councils, and a further special dispensation horn his Chief Intendant General foi the United States. Fra Alfred Creigh, they organized a new and sovereign body which they called the “Grand Imperial Council of Illinois” At this meeting a con- stitution was adopted, conforming in its general feanires to that of die parent body, but introducing a number of new matters sug - gested by the laws and usages of othet governing bodies of Fi ee - masonry in the United States. The new Grand Council thus cre - ated ‘as thereafter duly recognized and acknowledged by the Grand Imperial Council of tngland, as a properly organized and legally existing governing body of the orders with sovereign pow- en and a peer of the parent body. The constitution thus adopted at once became a target for amendments and the iecords disclose a vast number of these ad- denda during the few years that the Grand Imperial Council exhib - ited signs of vitality. By the year 1877 the Order sbowed visible evidences of a decline. The conclaves planted in uncongenial soil did not flourish; some were dying. some wet e already-dead. The sessions of the Grand Imperial Council fiom this on seem to have been little more than mere formalities In the year 1881 the situation seemed to indicate dissolution and no seasons were held after the aunual assembly of that year until October 24, 1887, when a perfunctory session was held at which Fra. Levi R. Jerome was elected Grand Sovereign. At this time there were no live con- claves in the jurisdiction, and the membership of Grand Council was maintained under the ancient constitutional provision providing for the retention on the roll of any conclave “so tong as a single member thereof shall be in existence” In the year 1890 the writer hereof racived the full investiture of the Order from the hands of Era Jerome, and ivith it, the Grand Sovereign being then an old and infirm nun, the appoint - ment of Coadjutor The continued ill health of Fra. Jerome and the pressing duties of the writer prevented any active measures for rehabilitation of the Order at that time. Fra Jerome died in 1892, and the succession devolved upon the last elected Viceroy. Fra Benn P. Reynolds The new Grand Sovereign renewed the appointment of his predecessor and as an [ntendsnt General the writer revived St Johns Conclave at Chicago, and caused to be instituted a new conclave at Champaign, Ill, now known as San Rubra. No. 2. On July 11, 1893, an assembly of the Grand Impe - nal Council was held, and since that time it has met regularly and duly published its proceedings A new policy was aJopted and nithm the lines of that policy the Orcfri has made substantial progress It was felt by the leaders that a return, in some meas- ure. to the old custojns of the Fraternity, together with a Ian - ited membership composed wholly of persons iiho had first been chosen. would not only give new life to the Order, but would afford a common meeting ground fuiished by none other of the concordant associations of Freemasonry. The policy thus inaug - urated has ever since been consistently foliowed. As the methods of the Grand Imperial Council became known, an interest was created in territory lying without the claimed exclu-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"9 LAWS CF THE CONSTANTINfAN CRD1~RS sive jurisdiction. This eventually resulted in the establishment of conclaves in other States, and with this extension oi territorial jurisdiction there came a general feeling that the organic law should be so changed as to fully meet the new conditions. This was finally effected by the adoption of a new constitution at the assem - bly held at Jacksonville, Ill., on October 13, 1899 By this con - stitution the imperial domain was enlarged so as to include the middle and western States, while the official title became “Grand Imperial Council for the Western Masonic Jurisdiction of the United States of America.” But conclaves continued to be formed in other parts of the country until finally the imperial sway ex - tended from ocean to ocean and from the lakes to the gulf Then was again felt the need of another revision of the organic law Tbis was had at the annual assembh he1~1 at Topeka, Kas on June 16, 1911.

ANCIENT STATUTES OF THE Knights of the Holy Sepulchre But little has ever come down to uis with respect to this Ancient Order of Chivalry in connection with its associated Order of the Red Cross. From the beginning it seems to have been a subsidiary Order, very exclusive iii chiaractei, and eoiiducted iii a very consei vative manner. It was pedldhed in this country, during the latter part of the eighteenth aiid early years of the nineteenth century, by the liispectors-Geiieral of the Rite of Perfection, but probably without authority. The name occurs in the lists of “high degrees” which these genthenien offered to a confiding public at that time, and there is much evidence to show that it was ctilti - sated to qulite an extent in many of the eastern cities There is but little doubt, however, that Ihe “degree” so exploited was Spti~ rious or clandestine, nor does it seem that it was ever con feti~t’il on this side of the Atlantic by legitiniate atithiority unt:il its iiitro~ duction by Col I\\Ioore in 1872. By the old English statuites the number of members was limited to ninety-nine, and all members wei e received in Mount Carmel Sanctuary in London. Btit one regular meeting was held during the year and this occurred on the Tuesday nearest the third day of 1\\Iay. Candidates for adniission were required to be Knights of the Red Cross and also Royal Arch Masons. The government o~f the Order was vested in a body styled the Grand Council of Patriarchs of Jerusaheni, or, as it was more famil - iarly known, the Patriarchial Council of the Order, which was composed of eighteen menibers. In the main, this order seems to have been goveriied by the sanie laws as that of the Red Cross, and the officers of the Patriarchal Couiiicil were usually the officers of corresponding grade in the Grand Imperial Council 16 0 \\V.

At its organization in 1872, the Grand Imperial Council, conforming to the-regulation of the Grand Imperial Council of England, adopted’ the following: - The Grand Sovereign shall, hQwever, be empowered lo authorize the substitution of a purple tunic, with a red cross on the breast, for the apron usually worn; and iw the event of such tUAic being adopted in any Con- aa~ dave, the same shall be worn by every member of that conclave The foregoing provision is, of course, for ceremonial pur - pbses only. No specific provision has ever been made for costumes in the Order of j~he Holy Sepulchre or Knights of St. John, and conclaves working these- -points are at liberty to employ such accessories as they may deem advisable. In the year 1873 the Grand Imperial Council, with what “a seems to-have been an erroneous conception of the true charac - ter of the Red Cross Order, adopted a semi-military uniform, similar to that worn by the Knights Templars. This’uniform • has long been discarded. The Order does not appear in public apd is not, in any sense, a military organization, as that term is now understood. The sentiment for many years has been stf’ongly opposed to public displays or the mimicry of military usages. For all social functions, and even for receptions, where short forms of installation are employed, the prescribed clothing con - sists of the evening - dress of society. ‘this is in conformity to the ancient usages of the Order and the established custom in all other countries where Conclaves h~ive been established. Where evening dress is worn, the sash, without any device there - on, is displayed under the vest. The sash, in such case, to be a purple, gros grain, silk ribboji four inches wide. ‘aO F ,aa F ‘U 0’"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"a V Forms - - Fidelitas, Unitas et Fervor - Petition For Installation To the M.
