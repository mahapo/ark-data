Past Royal Director Ed King will give the Invocation. Past Royal Director KING: Almighty and Gracious Lord God, our Heavenly Father, we rejoice that we continue to have Thy blessing, that Thou are with us from day to day, and be - seech Thy blessing in the future. Look down on us today while we deliberate as a group of men who love each other in our efforts to brighten the world in which we live. Bless our leaders; may they have knowledge and virtue. We ask these things in the Name of Christ. Amen. Royal Director OPPENBORN: We will remain standing and pledge allegiance to the Flag. (All present joined in the Pledge of Allegiance.) Royal Director OPPENBORN: Past Royal Director Doc Sharrer, will you come up to the rostrum? Are there any other Past Royal Directors in the house who are not on the rostrum? Is Dr. Burdats here? Royal Jesters, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to intro - duce the one and only Director of the Twin Octet of Medinah Temple and Chicago Court, Harry Walsh. (Applause) (The Twin Octet of Medinah Temple and Chicago Court offered the following selections. “We’re from Medinah,~’ “Why I Love You,” “The Happy Wanderer,” “Coney Island Babe,” “I’m Proud to be a Jester.” Generous applause greeted each selec - tion.) Royal Director OPPENBO RN: You know, Royal Jesters, when Harry Walsh puts on a program it is really something. We appreciate it very much Royal Jester Harry Walsh of Chicago Court No. 48. The Director of Chicago Court is seated over here. He is a very fine-looking young man with a kindly face. He is going to come up here now and give us an address of welcome. Director Albert N.

In behalf of Chicago Court, No. 48, I bid you welcome to our fair City of Chicago and hope you wi[l all have an enjoyable time. I also hope that harmony will prevail in your deliberations and that we will always remember that Mirth is King. Have fun and visit us again soon. God bless you all. Thank you. (Applause) Royal Director OPPENBORN: Thank you, Director Wallin. We will now hear from our Royal Leading Man, who in a few minutes will be our Royal Djrector, Royal Jester Robert Smith. (Applause) Royal Leading Man SMITH: Director Wallin of Chicago Court No. 48, Royal Director and Jesters all. When we meet in Chicago I am always reminded of that foray between the old grads of the University of Chicago and Harvard where the Har - vard boy got up and said, “I’m from Boston, the home of the bean and the cod; where the Lodges speak only to Cabots and the Cabots speak only to God” Then the old grad from Chicago got up and said, “I’m from Chicago, the home of the ham what am; where everybody speaks to his neighbor and nobody gives a damn.” (Laughter) In the spirit of mirth, Director Wallin, we accept your warm words of welcome and we look forward with pleasure to the things to come. Thanli you. (Applause) Royal Director OPPENBORN: Thank you, Royal Leading Man Robert Smith. Royal Jesters, ever since I have been a Jester—and I attended a National Court meeting for the first time in Washington, D. C. in 1935 — we have had two eminent men who have attended these gatherings. They are both Past Imperial Potentates of the Shrine. They both have all of the honors in Masonry that Masonry can award them. They were not empty honors because they are still laboring ardently, effectively, and insistently in the cause in which we believe. They are here today and I would like to have them stand so you can see them and then have you stand and 12"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS __ give them the Royal plaudits of Jesters. I want them to stand so you can see them, those who have labored so unceasingly in the interests of mirth and laughter. The one and only Tom Law. (Standing applause) And the one and only Judge Rowe of Buffalo, New York. (Standing applause) I want to say to you Judge, and to you Jester Tom, that you both are an inspiration to the Royal Directors from the first time I have had the pleasure to meet you and it is gratifying after all these years to see you come here with all the honors you have received and participale in the events and activities of the Royal Order of Jesters. Thank you very, very much. (Applause) At this time, Royal Jesters, one of the most important matters of our program is scheduled. It is one that deserves much serious thought. I trust that you will be quiet and that you will harken to every word of wisdom spoken by the narrator. The man who was just introduced is going to give the Necrology Report of those beloved Jesters who have passed into the Great Beyond during the last year. I am going to call on Past Imperial Potentate Tom Law to give the Necrology Report assisted by the Double Octet of Chicago Court. THOMAS C. LAW A±lanta Court No. 91 Royal Prelate NECROLOGY REPORT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS — NATIONAL COURT Chicago, Ill. - July 12, 1955 “There is a stream that we all must cross The river of human years, Now lying calm in the summer’s light Now splashed with the rain of tears. Out from the hill of God it flows, And on to the shoreless sea, Where the noontide sun no shadow throws And time is eternity.” It is but meet and fitting that we should pause in the midst of our pleasure to realize that we must all sooner or later cross that “river of human years.” To those of us who are permitted to linger longer, more slowly to climb the hills capped with sunshine and pass through the valleys covered with shadow, it is a privilege to render loving homage to the memory of dear friends who have reached the river by a shorter route and who, having crossed and finished their course in faith, now rest from the labors of the journey. These men were Jesters. They did not believe in an emo - tional appeal. They linew the true meaning of sentiment and admired it in others. They had no room for gloom for their lives have been filled with joy and laughter. So we will not attempt to eulogize their memories or appeal to the emotions of those who loved them. They would not have had it so. Nor would any one of them care for us lo make this an occasion of sorrow or sadness. So let us entertain for them those memories, images and precious thoughts that will not die and cannot be destroyed. The list as reported shows 377 names. Over three hundred outstanding and carefully selected Shriners, Masons who were good Shriners because they could laugh and play, Emeritus members of the Shrine known and loved from coast to coast. Such men as Walter Fancourt and Albert Ladner of Philadelphia, Louis Strum of Jacksonville, Stan Bruner of Los Angeles, Jack McGilvray of San Francisco, Fontaine Johnson of Sacramento, and tl-ie noblest Roman of them all, Frank Roundy of Chicago."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL ~ff1m’TMji NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS Such great Masons as James Collins of Salt Lake City, and the Hon. Peter Schmuck of New York. Dozens of Past Potentates, such as Frank Cromwell of Kansas City, Walter Jeffries of At - lantic City, Andrew Seiler of Boston, John DeGrazier of Dallas, Frank Luckiesh of Atlanta. Their Masonic, Shrine and Jester history is recorded in their local bodies and in our hearts who knew and loved them. I use a part of a tribute which it was my privilege to pay uo Frank Roundy, the Senior Past Potentate, Past Imperial Potenlate and oldest 330 Mason in the world. This with a few changes will apply to all and will be our Jester tribute today: Henry Van Dyke once wrote: “Be glad of life because it gives you a chance to work and to play—and to look up at the stars.” How perfectly that sentence applies to the life of Frank Roundy. He was unselfish in his work. There was never the slightest indication thaI he sought reward. He was a perfectionist and the quality of the work was all that counted with him. He left his imprint on every administration of Medinah Temple. He was the close friend, counsellpr and advisor for every Poten - tate of lVledinah Temple for nearly fifty years. We of other Temples who knew these Potentates and Frank, recognized the continuing pattern, year after year. He was most responsible for making Medinah a great Temple. His influence in the Im - perial Council will always be felt. Frank Roundy possessed to a marked degree that manly devotion for his friends—a platonic friendship that was love in its most practical form—Masonic Brotherhood. He was the friend of every Noble who knew him. Such a man must be friendly himself. He developed and prac - liced the “chance to love.” Frank could play loo. He played clean, like a real Shriner, a Jester, and the Christian gentleman that he was. He had a keen sense of humor which he disp[ayed in a manner that left no stings. Anyone who has followed his work in the Directors’ Association knows this. He welcomed the chance to play. Ovid says that, “God gave man an upright counlenance to survey the heavens and to look upward to the stars.” Truly Frank Roundy could look upward to the stars and draw his in- spiration. He was a man of the highest ideals. He elevated the moral and spiritual fiber of Medinah Temple and every Noble with whom he came in contact. When it was necessary for him to place the spiritual above the material it was easy to do so. He who can look up at Ihe stars and can, in imagina lion, live among the stars and exert their influence on his own life and the lives of others. “Not how did he die but how did he live, Not whal did he gain but what did he give, Not what did the sketch in the newspaper say, But how many hearts were sorry when he went away, These are the units to measure the worth of a man.” Farewell, Jesters all. You lived well and practiced Mirth at its best while here with us. May the peace of Allah abide with you and may we join you among the stars when our call comes. Respectfully submitted, THOMAS C.

Royal Director OPPENBORN: Royal Jester Tom Law, I am sure that the Royal Jesters assembled here this afternoon will never forget the tribute you have paid to the beloved Jesters who have passed on during the past year. Thank you, very much, Harry Walsh, for your fine assistance. (Applause) And now it comes time, Royal Jesters, for the Royal Director to give the report of his stewardship of the National Court during the past year but, before doing so, I would like to recognize a few Royal Jesters who have been an inspiration to me for many, many years; who are Past Royal Directors and who have come here from year to year to be with us during our meetings and our frivolities and our serious conversations. First I want to recognize and present to you an Illustrious Royal Jestet- and Past Royal Director, Ed King. (Applause) Dr. Harry Sharrer, the Royal Director in 1943. (Applause) I was just informed that the dean of the Royal Directors, a grand and glorious person, from Wheeling, West Virginia, just came into our Jester Court, Dr. Oscar Burdats. (Applause) Next is Billy Wray from Montreal. (Applause) A great guy. A man who has given me many inspirations not only in Jesterdom but the Shrine and Masonry as we[l; a man whom I have loved and have cherished his friendship for many, many years, a member of the Jurisprudence and Laws Committee of the Imperial Council, my beloved friend and your friend, Past Royal Director Willard Lombard. (Applause) NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS And the eyes of Texas are upon us this aflernoon as I present our be[oved Dr. Harrison Cave. (Applause) Walter Seeger from St. Paul, Minnesota, Past Royal Director in 1950. (Applause) An honor member of our Court is none other than that fine gentleman of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Miami Beach. Tony Gocking, Past Royal Director. (Applause) And “meet me in St. Louis” Charles Franklyn, Past Royal Director. (Applause) And from the great Northwest, a man we love and t-evere, take his advice and try to listen to it, a ma~a whom everybody recognizes, Past Royal Director Rube Adams. (Applause) My immechate predecessor who gave me many, many inspira - tions and I have tried to live up to his teachings and inspirations. I have fallen down on many things but Arthur has tried to inculcate in my mind many things but I respect him for what he is, one of the greatest Royal Directors Jesterdom ever had, Arthur Loomis. (Applause) I would like to recognize my Illustrious Potentate of Mahi Temple who has lent inspiration to Miami Court No. 88, and also Mahi Temple of the Shrine. I am sure he is here; Illustrious Harold Ingoe. (Applause) REPORT OF THE ROYAL DIRECTOR TO TIlE OFFICERS & MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS THROUGHTOUT THE REALM: On June 29th, 1954, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, you des - ignated me your Royal Director, to be and to act as such until today. You conferred upon me a great honor—as great an honor as may be conferred upon any Royal Jester. You placed upon my shoulders the great responsibilities that go with the honor. I have told you, heretofore, that I accepted both the responsibility and the honor with all humility, and that [ would do the very best that was ir~ me. As I stand here upon this rostrui YOU sincerely that I have done my best. 24 25"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING I have lived three score and ten years—most of them very happy years—because I have worked hard and I have played hard. However, the year immediately preceding this Annual Meeting has been the happiest year of my life time. I have really learned what the spirit of true fraternity in its highest and noblest sense of fraternal affection, love and courtesy meant. Never before have I been associated so closely with a finer group of men than the Royal Jesters of North America. Wherever I went I sensed a feeling of “Honest to God” Brotherhood, of loyalty and fidelity to the cause in which we are engaged. Men in all walks of life dedicated and consecrated to the principles and precepts of the various organizations pre-requisite to membership in the Royal Order of Jesters. It was a great year, fellow Jesters, and a wonderful experience to your Royal Director, and from that experience I conscientiously believe and am firmly con - vinced that our order has a great purpose and a place and a niche on one of the rungs of that ladder that leads to fame in the greatest fraternal family in the world, and in which we so proudly claim membership. In my travels and visitations about the realm, in my discus - sions with hundreds of Royal Jesters who visited in my home town, where summer spends the winter, [found all Royal Jesters laboring ardently and efficiently in all branches of Masonry, and in the Shrine, doing everything in their power to propagate and extend the principles of these organizations, and doing it with a smile of fellowship for their Lodge, for their Chapters, their Councils, their Commandries, the Consistories, and their Shrine Temples. So that is why I say we have a definite place and a niche being carved on one of the rungs of the Ladder. Every - where I went I found the same Royal Jester spirit. In the great northwest, in the Black Hills of South Dakota, one of America’s most beautiful spols, and where I really rel - ished my first T-Bone Buffalo steak; Rapids City, Lead, and Deadwood, (where no Royal Director has ever visited—so [ was told) I found the same joyful spirit of “Momus,” the “King of Mirth,” whom we emulate, and there the leaders of Masonry and the Shrine were in the vanguard. So it was at Cleveland, where the Courts of Ohio participated in a wonderful ceremonial session, and where the “Book of the Play” was exemplified with perfection and decorum. Our own beloved and venerable Past Imperial Potentate, Al Fiebach— Royal Jester Al Fiebach—who has received all the honors that could be conferred upon any Mason, displayed great histrionic ability as a Judge of the Court. At Hartford and Boston, throughout all New England, across the Empire State from New York City to Buffalo, through Ohio and Michigan, in all my travels throughout the Realm; the Golden West, the East and the North and the South, I found Royal Jesters doing their bit to make their fellowmen happy, in the hope that our idealogy, our way of life and our fraternal bonds shall hold us together as Masons, Shriners, Royal Jesters. In all my travels I found the subordinate Courts in good financial condition, and extending and propagating the true spirit of Jesterdom. About 2% of the subordinate Courts are rather dormant and have been so for several years. In one of our great states, where there is but one Shrine Temple and one Court of Royal Jesters, a membership of 21 Jesters has been maintained for a number of years. There are several other Courts in this same condition, according to statistical records, with many fine outstanding eligible Shriners in their Jurisdiction who would fit into our picture and into our scheme of good fellowship and mirth as the king. Of course, these Courts are the only ones who really suffer, for Jesterdom, as a National Organization, is on the March! Your Royal Director called a Mid-Winter Meeting in Miami Beach, Florida, on March lst-2nd-3rd, 1955, where we gathered at the Sax ony Hotel. Present were: Royal Leading Man ROBERT P. SMITH, of Capital Court, Washington; Royal Tragedian WILLIAM HOEFGEN of [ndianapolis Court; Royal Impresario W. HOWARD MILLINGTON of Pit ts - burg, Kansas Court; Royal Leading Lady CHARLES M. HOFMAN, of Chi - cago Court; Royal Heavy Man CHARLES H. LEMPKE, of Albu - querque Court; 26 9,7"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING Royal Light Comedian JOHN JEPSON, of Hartford Court; Royal Character Man CHARLES G. WHITE of Cleve - land Court, and Royal Property Man BILL OLDENBURGER, of Mexico City Court. Your Royal Director was very happy over the attendance and much good was derived from the general discussion of many subjects pertaining to Jesterdom. This meeting of the Royal Officers coincided with the visitation of the Imperial Potentate of the Shrine to Mahi Temple in Miami, and the Imperial Poten - tate advised with us in our deliberations, and much good was derived from this conference. The National Court Officers were among the distinguished guests at the reception for the Imperial Potentate at the Scottish Rite Temple Auditorium on March 4th, and they and their Ladies were also guests at a beautiful Ban - quet given in honor of the Imperial Potentate by Mahi Temple on March 5th, 1955. Your Royal Director shall always be grateful for the wonder - ful cooperation, advice, loyalty and true spirit of fraternal love and friendship of the officers of the National Court. It has been a grand and glorious experience. Shortly after the Mid-Winter Meeting in Miami Beach a letter from Howard Millington told the Royal Director that he would receive a “little old gift package” from the Royal Officers who were in Miami. I was thrilled, of course, because [ am human. However, when the “little old gift package” came it was a “right good sized little old gift package.” A hugh carton came by express from Baltimore, Maryland, with a gorgeous sterling silver service of “Baltimore Rose,” the pattern of all our silver - ware. My girl, Nellie, and I have lived together in holy wedlock for fifty years come next Christmas Day, and this silver service was the most beautiful gift we have ever received and we shall never forget the ,manner in which it came to us. However, we have had many happy surprises wherever we went during the past year, and every Court of Royal Jesters visited by the Royal Director presented him with gifts of lasting beauty and useful - ness. Thanks again, Royal Jesters, for the honor of having served you! It has not been an empty honor, and I sincerely trust that you may, in a measure, approve of my stewardship over the past year. NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS I know that through the years ahead the National Court will be in good hands. Your Royal Impresario is one of the most efficient and cooperative men I have ever been associated with, and your Royal Leading Man Robert P. Smith of Capital Court who, in a few short minutes, will be your Royal Director, is an outstanding fraternalist and is most emminently qualified by experience to guide the Royal Order’s Ship of State. I commend him to your favor and pray that his efforts and your friendship will bring him the same year of joy and happiness I have had, because. “There’s nothing that equa[s true frnendship, The best thing the world can bestow; May your success bring happiness and may you Remember, wherever you go. There’s nothing that equals true friendship, With a love that is tender and true. So here’s to you, friend, right down to the End; Here’s love, here’s success to you.” And so, with a heart full of happiness, and the kindest fra - ternal greeting to you, I pray that “Momus,” the “King of Mirth,” will reign supreme throughout the realm and bring you joy and happiness and life and laughter, and that the supreme Royal Director of all that is be with you always. HENRY L. OPPENBORN, ROYAL DIRECTOR. (The Royal Director read his Annual Report, at the conclu - sion of which there was standing applause.) Royal Leading Man SMITH. Royal Director, I know I be - speak the sentiment of everyone here for that grand report. I now recognize Jester Grover Nolte, the Chairman of the Committee on Transactions of National Officers; Royal Jester Grover Nolte from the great Northwest.

Nolte.)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING REPORT OF TRANSACTIONS OF OFFICERS COMMITTEE To the Royal Director, Officers and Representatives of the National Court, Royal Order of Jesters: Your Committee on Transaction of Officers of the National Court concurs with you in approving the various reports rendered here today. It is refreshing to note the many visitations to local Courts made by your genial Royal Director and your efficient Royal Impresario. On many of these visitations they were accompanied by other line officers of the National Court and by Past Royal Directors. All this contributed to the success of local meetings and made for the general well being of Jesterdom. We particularly recommend the continuation of the period - ical publication of “The Bauble.” It has great possibilities and can be made the means of disseminating valuable and interesting information to Jesters generally. It need not be expanded, how - ever, to any great extent to accomplish this purpose. To do so might prove financially embarassing and wreck the enterprise. We congratulate Royal Director Oppenborn and Royal Im - presario Millington for keeping. Old King Momus on the jump this past year. “Long Live the King”! Respectfully submitted, GROVER C. NOLTE, Chairman CARL A. RAHN, Asst. Chairman J. A. WALDEN EDGAR L. JONES DANIEL F. MUNN Jester GROVER NOLTE: Royal Director, I move the adop - tion of the re’~ort.

(Motioned seconded) All in favor signify by saying, “aye.” Contrary? Unani - mously adopted. Royal Director OPPENBORN: Thank you, very much, Royal Jesters.

I have several other presentations to make here; the mem - bers of the National Court, many of whom accompanied me on the visitations throughout the realm throughout the past year and I would like to present them to you. I would like to present to you again the man who just acted as Royal Director in presenting the resolution, this fine young man who will be our Royal Director in a few minutes, Royal Leading Man Robert P.

(Royal Officers were greeted with applause as they were introduced.) I understand that our beloved friend and member of the National family, Norman Boyd, has a report to make and a word he would like to say to the Royal Order of Jesters assembled here this afternoon. Royal Stage Manager BOYD: Royal Director and members of the Royal family and Representatives of the Royal Court. This after the introduction recently made, is sort of a “hello and goodbye.” I don’t know whether you have ever seen a victim of blasted hopes and frustrated ambitions before but, if by any chance you should happen to be looking in this direction at the present moment, you will discover one. 37"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS For many years I have had a very deep desire and ambition to become the head of this wonderful organization, the Royal Order of Jesters and I had determined that if I ever reached that pinnacle that I would give you an administration that would compare favorably with those of my very distinguished prede - cessors. For eight successive years you have most graciously ac - cepted me into the Royal family and elected me to the next higher office and, with but two more to go, it seemed that the goal was in reach unless you happened to have a change of heart, of course. Unfortunately, Father Time has taken a hand and produced a condition I cannot ignore. On competent advice I am informed that to undertake to travel and other obligations the Royal Director assumes, would hasten a result which, although ulti - mately inevitable, is never looked upon with any degree of ac - ceptance. The office of Royal Director cannot be successfully exer - cised from a desk or office. In fact, ninety per cent of the pleasure attached to the office is the joy of visiting the Courts of North America and meeting and breaking bread with the splendid membership that constitutes the Order. Denied this privilege, the administration would be a flop and that I could not tolerate. Accordingly, I am not waiting until the last minute to with - draw but am requesting the Nominating Committee not to consider me as a candidate as Royal Tragedian. Before this action is taken, however, I wish to express to you as Representatives of your various Courts my deep and sincere appreciation for the consideration you have accorded me in the past and to assure you that my interest in the Royal Court of Jesters, of which I have been a member for some thirty-three years, will never cease and that in the future I shall continue to boost from the sidelines. Once more, I give you my very grateful thanks. (Applause) Royal Director OPPENBORN. Royal Jesters and Royal Stage Manager Norman Boyd. About four months ago Norman wrote me and told me what he expressed to you here today. I was mortified and chagrinned to think that he would give up at this particular time and I wrote to him begging him, pleading with him, to reconsider what he had said to me in his recent letter. But he immediately replied and told me what he said to you here today and I know that he is sincere and that he regrets it as much as any of us. I am going to ask you what you want to do about it, Royal Jesters. Royal Leading Man SMITH: Royal Director, I move that we accept the resignation and I will have another motion to make after this. Royal Treasurer WILHARM: Royal Director, I second the motion. Royal Director OPPENBORN: Moved and seconded that we accept the resignation of Royal Stage Manager Norman Boyd from the National Court. All those in favor signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. So ordered. Royal Leading Man SMITH: Royal Director, we of the Royal family, and I am sure every one of you out there, hear this report with deep regret. Royal Stage Manager Norman Boyd has lived Jesterdom all his life. He is one of our greatest; he is a great Jester. He has been an Emeritus Member of the Imperial Council for many years. He has been on the Finance Committee and taken an active part in all its proceedings; and likewise in the proceedings of the Royal Court. So it is with deep regret that we receive this report. We would urge him to carry on but his health and his phy - sician will not allow him to do so. So that he might, however, continue among us and continue to be recognized as a Past Royal Officer, [ move you, Sir, Royal Director, that he be made a Representative Ad Vitam. Jester GEORGE H. ROWE: Royal Director, coming from New York State and having known Norm for many, many years, I second the motion. Royal Director OPPENBORN: You have heard the motion, Royal Jesters. It has been seconded by the dean of the Supreme Court of Buffalo, New York, Past Imperial Potentate Rowe. Are you ready for the question? VOICES: Question! Royal Director OPPENBORN: All in favor signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. 38 39"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING NAT[ONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS You are now an Ad Vitam member of the Royal Court, Royal Jester Norman Boyd, and may God bless you. Applause) Royal Stage Manager NORMAN A. BOYD: Thank you, Jesters. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate that. Royal Director OPPENBORN: We will now have the report of the Royal Impresario. REPORT OF THE ROYAL IMPRESARIO To the Royal Director, National Court Officers, and Repre - sentatives to this 38th Annual Meeting of the Royal Order of Jesters It is my privilege to give you a report of the operation of the office of your Royal Impresario for the year ending March 31, 1955. I will give only a resume of the important items as a detailed statement in full will be printed in the Proceedings of this Meeting. Membership:— Membership, January 1, 1954 Created, 1954 .

Finances: The financial position of the National Court is better than a year ago. The report of the auditor shows an increase of $10,- 48833 in our net assets to a total of $61,954.03. The auditors report shows a net profit on the years operations of $8,547.28, which is nearly $6,000.00 more than the estimate set up by the budget adopted at the last Annual Meeting. At the Midwinter Meeting of your National Officers, all the figures on the operation of the office available at that time were presented. I recommended at that time that there be purchased, out o~ the general funds, $9000.00 in bonds to be added to our bond ac - count. Since the close of our fiscal year, March 31, 1955, I recom - mend that this be increased to a total of $14,000.00 in bonds. This matter will be presented to you by the Finance Committee. I have kept your Royal Director and your Chairman of the Finance Committee advised of the financial condition of the National Court by sending each a copy of the Trial Balance at the end of each month. The year just closed has been a most pleasant one made so by the privilege of working with our Royal Director, Henry L. Op - penborn, and the Officers of the Royal Court. The Officers of the National Court have been most considerate and helpful in all matters pertaining to the administration o~ the office of the Royal Impresario and to our Royal Director and officers of the National Court, my sincerest appreciation and thanks. Respectfully submitted to this 38th Annual Meeting of the National Court, Royal Order of Jesters.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON GRIEVANCES AND APPEALS To the Royal Director and Representatives to the Royal Court of Jesters: Greetings. Once upon a time there was a chap who became a member of a fraternal organization. This fellow was an introvert of an extreme type. When talking to others he would construe their remarks, however casual or impersonal, to apply to himself and would assay them mentally to discover a possible unpleasant reference to which he might take exception. His attitude toward the actions of others was of a similar nature and as a result he felt certain he was a special object of harassment of ~he world in general. Under his native delusion he persuaded the presiding officer of the organization of which he had become a member to set up a committee to pass on all complaints he was sure the members nursed, and more particularly on those which he, himself, would have occasion to make. Time went on and gradually the subject of our discussion commenced to realize that he was in a new and hitherto undis - covered environment. He was amazed, confused, but eventually delighted to find that his associates were truly interested in his welfare; that they stressed, in their association with others, the pleasant and heartening phases of life to the elimination of dis - agreeable things, and that cordiality, good nature and happiness dominated their relations with others. And so gradually Joy entered his being and, in this unusual atmosphere, thrived in the heart of the new member. His course of life underwent a complete metamorphosis and he commenced to work with increasing enthusiasm to spread happiness among those with whom he came in contact. He deve[oped a personal interest in the problems of his fellow members; a sympathetic attitude to the childish pranks of the neighbors’ kids, and even - tually became an Evangel of Mirth and Joy among associates less fortunate than he. He had become a real Jester and now is a welcome guest on every occasion. In the meantime, and during the development of this miracle, the committee which had been set up in the organization became thoroughly stagnant as it had nothing to do, and it continues, so to speak, to wither on the vine. It barely exists, and then in name only. The moral of this tale is this: If you want to have a title and get name in the annual book of the Royal Court, without any obligation to work, just persuade the Powers that Be to put you on the Committee on Grievances and Appeals. Jesters don’t have any grievances, or if they do, they forget them. Respectfully submitted, COMMITTEE on GRIEVANCES AND APPEALS NORMAN A. BOYD, Chairman JESSE D. HURLBUT, Vice-Chin. GEORGE E.

Carried. -I The Committee on Jurisprudence and Laws, that venerable gentleman whom we all love — and enjoy his Christmas cards and cards after every election — from Topeka, Kansas, our beloved Chairman of Jurisprudence and Laws, Al F. Williams. Come up here, Al, where they can hear you better. Jester AL F. WILLIAMS: Royal Director and Jesters, during the last year your Committee has had thirteen matters come before it; some of which were propositions to amend existing By-Laws and some of which were for the purpose of adopting entirely new sets of By-Laws. I will read to you the names of the various Courts that are included in this report: Albuquerque, Chattanooga, St. Louis, Toronto, Denver, Watertown. . Now those I have just read are Courts in which they were submitting amendments to their existing By-Laws. New Orleans, Philadelphia, Albany, Wichita Falls, Alex - andria, Wilmington, Springfield, Illinois; now these Courts sub - mitted entirely new By-Laws. These matters were submitted to the Jurisprudence and Laws Committee and handled during the last year. There was an entirely new set submitted by Cleveland but they were disapproved and no further action taken by the Com - mittee. There is another matter coming up which I will not include in this partial report and that is the adoption of an entirely new set of By-Laws and Constitution of the National Court. REPORT OF JURISPRUDENCE AND LAWS COMMITTEE Royal Director, Officers and Representatives of the National Court: Your Committee on Jurisprudence and Laws begs leave to submit the following Report: The following named Courts have submitted to your Com - mittee proposed Amendments to their By-Laws: Albuquerque Court No. 24 Chattanooga Court No. 39 St. Louis Court No. 81 Toronto Court No. 83 Denver Court No. 138 Watertown Court No. 142 The following named Courts sets of By-Laws: have submitted entire]y new New Orleans Court No. 36 Philadelphia Court No~ 72 Albany Court No. 77 Wichita Falls Court No. 85 Alexandria Court No. 162 Wilmington Court No. 164 Springfield, Illinois Court No. 20 An entirely new set of By-Laws was submitted by Cleveland Court No. 14, but were disapproved by the Committee. Your Committee finally reporting states that all of the pro - posed By-Laws and proposed Amendments to By-Laws submitted by the various Courts listed above, with the exception of Cleve - land Court No. 14, has been by your Committee duly and reg - ularly approved.

Their signatures are all included and I submit that they have all been put there. There is not a cockeyed one of them who ever saw this report before except me. (Laughter) I move the adoption of the report. Royal Director OPPENBORN: You have heard the motion and he says that no one has ever seen it. Jester AL F. WILLIAMS: Right now is the time for them to say something. (Motion seconded) Royal Director OPPENBORN: You have heard the motion and ~he second. All in favor of this portion of the report by the Jurisprudence and Laws Committee signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. Carried. Jester AL F. WILLIAMS: For a minute I thought my foot was going to slip. I have been doing this for about ten years and I haven’t been stopped yet. I want to make an inquiry. How many of the Jesters have read the copy of the proposed new Constitution and By-Laws? (Hands raised) Well, that is fairly representative. This is vol - uminous. Do you want me to i~ead it? VOICES: No! Jester AL F. WILLIAMS: Boys, that is good; that is what you call “uninimous.” I want to say that there have been a number of amendments presented at this meeting relative to the new set of By-Laws we are now talking about. These are submitted by our mutual friend, Louis Chackes; I don’t think anybody ever heard of Louis. (Laughter) I venture to say that it would be good to get oriented. These have been submitted by Louis Chackes. (Reading) Article III, Section 1. The Annual Meeting of the National Court of the Royal Order of Jesters shall be held on the day preceding the annual meeting of the Imperial Council, A. A. 0. N. M. S., at the city chosen for such meeting. I move to amend this Section by adding the following language, “or at such time or place chosen and voted by the National Court.” So that the Section as amended shall read as follows: (Reading) Article III, Section 1. The, Annual Meeting of the National Court of the Royal Order of Jesters shall be held on the day pre - ceding the annual meeling of the Imperial Council, A. A. 0. N. M. S., at the city chosen for such meeting or at such lime or place chosen and voted by the National Court. Now that means that this language has been added. It gives you an opportunity to hold your meetings at some other day and place other than that of the Imperial Council. I move the adoption of the amendment. (Motion seconded) Royal Director OPPENBORN: You have heard the motion and the second. Any question? VOICES: Question! Royal Director OPPENBORN: All in favor signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. Carried unan - imously. Jesler AL F. WILLIAMS: Now, let me make this suggestion if you please. It isn’t the desire of the Committee, or the desire of the Jesters who prepared this set of By-Laws, to bar any Jester at any time from having something to say on the question. If you do not agree with the amendment it is perfectly all right with the Committee if you want to speak. Article VII, Section 15, now reads as follows: (Reading) Article VII, Section 15. Every Subordinate Court also shall have power and authority to discipline or expel any member of such Court for conduct unbecoming a Jester, or which brings the Royal Order of Jesters into disrepute. I move to amend by striking the word “also” and adding the following, “The accused shall be served in person or by registered mail with the formal written charges. He shall have the right of Counsel such to be a member of the Royal Order of Jesters in good standing. It shall require a majority vote of the Jesters present at such meeting on the question of guill and the question of discipline or expulsion.

If a request for a reinstate - ment is denied by the vote of the Court he shall not be permitted to petition for a period of one year thereafter.” So that the Sec - tion as amended, the new Section, will read this way. (Reading) Article VII, Section 15. Every Subordinate Court shall have power and authority to discipline or expel any member of such Court for conduct unbecoming a Jester, or which brings the Royal Order of Jesters into disrepute.

If a request for a reinstatement is denied by the vote of the Court he shall not be permitted to petition for a period of one year thereafter. I now move you the adoption of the report. (Motion seconded) Jester JOHN VESEY: Royal Director, I would like to object. My objection is simply this; to expel a man on a majority vote is not right. Everybody in the Court should be pretty well satis - fied that the man is guilty and I think it should require more than a majority vote to expel, especially when you have two- thirds to reinstate. I would think that it should be 75% of the members present at the meeting. I would be glad to hear other sugges tions but I do think that a majority vote to expel a man from the Court is inadequate. Jester AL F. WILLIAMS: Any other remarks? We will hear from Louis Chackes who is submitting this amendment. K NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS Jester LOUIS CHACKES: Royal Director and members of the Court. May I say that I introduced the amendment merely because the By-Laws as submitted stated, and I will repeat it, “Every Subordinate Court shall have power and authority to discipline or expel any member of such Court for conduct un - becoming a Jester, or which brings the Royal Order of Jesters into disrepute.” When I read that I thought it did put too much power within a Court; especially since they did not require a special meeting to be called for the purpose, or did it give the man accused the right to face his accusers or be represented by Counsel. Neither did it give the Court or the Jester himself a right to appeal; neith - er did he have a chance to get back in. I placed the word “majority” in there and I have no pref - erence for the word except I retained that part of the original amendment which gave the Court the right to expel; naturally, that would be majority. Incidentally, in the prerequisite, which would be the Shrine, I believe the Shrine gives the right to expel to a majority. I am inclined to agree that it should be larger. I am willing to amend my amendment and if John Vesey is willing, that as long as it takes two-thirds vote to reinstate, I move now that the word “majority” here be changed to “two - thirds.” Jester JOHN VESEY. I would be glad to accept that. I just didn’t want it to be a popularity contest. Jester LOUIS CHACKES: And I want you to know that it doesn’t interfere with me. I just want him to have a fair rattle, shake and roll. Jester J. Y. JORDAN, JR.: Royal Director and members of this convention. I object to the feature in this proposed amend - ment of the right of appeal from the local Court to the Royal Court. Personally, I think that the local Courts are the ones to handle that; and then, when we have an appeal, it would have to come before this entire organization. At the present time we have no committee, no Court of Appeals, and I understand there is nothing set up in the organization to handle that matter. So why, when we come to an annual meeting, should we have the appeal of some suspended, or expelled, member of a local Court 64"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JEST ERS and have to thrash it out here? Suppose that is done and the local Court is not supported? In my judgment that would not make for satisfactory feeling between that subordinate Court and the Royal Court. I think that feature should be deleted. Royal Director OPPENBORN: Royal Jester, we have a Com - mittee on Grievances and Appeals that will handle any appeal from a Royal Jester before it comes before the National Court. Jester J. Y. JORDAN, JR.: Royal Director, I understand it says, “Appeal to the Royal Court.” Should that be spelled out or does it mean the Committee? Jester LOUIS CHACKES: We do have a Committee on Griev - ances and Appeals, a standing Committee, on which I served for many years with no work to do except to prepare and present reports. The Committee members were always happy they had no particular work to do. The appeal made by anybody, either the Court or man who lost the case, would under normal con - ditions eventually be referred to this Committee on Grievances and Appeals. The report of the Grievances and Appeals Com - mittee would be submitted to the National Court for approval. always believe that anybody should have the right of appeal to some higher place. In the Blue Lodge, York or Scottish Rites, or Shrine, or anywhere in the structure of Freemasonry, first a man has a chance to listen to the accusation and protect him - self; and then, when the judgment is rendered, he has the right to appeal it some place else. That doesn’t mean he wins the ap - peal but he does have a last appeal and it should be within the supreme body, whether the Grand Lodge or whatever. We do it in the Shrine too. For that reason, my dear friend, I am inclined to believe it should stay in there. Royal Director OPPENBORN: Are you ready for the ques - tion? The question is that the report of the Jurisprudence and Laws Commit tee, as amended, be approved. VOICES: Question! Royal Director OPPENBORN: We will vote on the amend - ment to change “majority” to “two-thirds.” All those in favor signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. Carried unanimously. Now we vote on the original motion, Jester AL. WILLIAMS: The only change is from “majority” to “two-thirds.” Royal Director OPPENBORN From a majority to two- thirds of those present. Are you ready for the question? VO[CES: Question! Royal Director OPPEINBORN: All in favor signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. Carried. Jester AL. F. WILLIAMS: Now, Louis has got another one here. We want to take up Article XI, Section 1 which now reads as follows: (Reading) Article X[, Section 1. This Constitution, By-Laws, or any part thereof, may be changed or amended at any meeting of the National Court, provided written notice of said change has been mailed to the Director, Impresario and Representatives of all Subordinate Courts, at least thirty (30) days prior to said meeting, or provided that said change is submitted in writing to, and has the approval and recommendation of, a majority of the Juris - prudence and Laws Committee, as constituted, sitting at any meeting of the National Court. I move to amend by striking the words, “or provided that said change is submitted in writing to, and has the approval and recommendation of, a majority of the Jurisprudence and Laws Committee, as constituted, sitting at any meeting of the National Court.” And substituting the following, “and pro - vided such written amendment shall first be referred to and re - ported on by the Jurisprudence and Laws Committee, as con - stituted, and sitting at any meeting of the National Court.” So that this section as amended shall read as follows. (Reading) Article XE, Section 1. This Constitution, By-Laws, or any part thereof, may be changed or amended at any meeting of the National Court, provided written notice of said change has been mailed to the Director, Impresario and Representatives of all Subordinate Courts, at least thirty (30) days prior to said meeting, and provided such written amendment shall first be referred to and reported on by the Jurisprudence and Laws Committee, as 66 67"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS constituted, and sitting at any meeting of the National Court.

Royal Director OPPENBORN: You have heard the motion and the second. Are you ready for the question? VOICES: Question! Royal Director OPPENBORN: All in favor signify by saying “aye~’ at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. Carried. Jester LOUIS CHACKES. Royal Director, my attention has been drawn to something that, while it is understood, the lang - uage says, This Constitution, By-Laws, or any part thereof, may be changed or amended at any meeting of the National Court.” Somebody thought it should be “Annual Meeting.” We only have one meeting. When the Officers meet, that is not a meeting of the National Court. Is that right? Does that clear it up? Royal Director OPPENBORN: That is right. Jester AL F. WILLIAMS: Now I have a couple of amend - ments here that I want to present personally and not as a member of the Jurisprudence and Laws Committee. E do not speak for the rest of the members of the Committee. Before I speak I would like to ask if any Jester present has any amendment to present on these By-Laws. If you have, I would be glad to hear it now. Now, this is changing the Constitutional Law of the Royal Order of Jesters. We don’t do that very often and if you have anything in your system to get rid of, now is the time to speak up. Don’t come back later on begging. I want to make two suggestions. The first is on Section 5 and I will read it to you; it is simple. (Reading) Section 5. The method of choosing the thirteen initiates a year shall be left to each Subordinate Court; provided, however, it shall be by unanimous vote of those present after notice, unless the By-Laws of the Subordinate Court shall provide for election of New Candidates if not more than two (2) black balls appear on a secret ballot. A JESTER: What Article is the amendment to? Jester AL F. WlLLIAN~[S: Section 5 of Article IX. Now, the idea I have here is simply to call your attention that nobody can get into this Order by going out and asking to be a member. It is on invitation and not as a candidate and the boys who presented this, I think, forgot. They probably belonged to another organization where you can get in if you pay the amount. I want to change that to”Nominees.” I think you get the point. It is a Nominee who is being invited in and not a Candidate beg - ging. I move the adoption of the amendment. (Motion seconded) Royal Director OPPENBORN: You have heard the motion and the second. Are you ready for the question? VOICES: Question! Royal Director OPPENBORN: All in favor signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. Carried, Royal Impresario. Jester AL F. WILLIAMS. Now we are getting to something that may be a little controversial. For something like ten years I have been connected with this Committee. During that time I have had written communications from Jester Courts and num - erous Jesters individually throughout North America. I have also had personal conversations at times and I want to say that most of the questions that arose were on the question of getting into the Court and of getting out of the Court. The Law, of course, now and as provided in these new By-Laws is the same. If you can’t get more than two fellows to vote against a Nominee he is elected but this particular question here is going just on the other side and I will read this Section as it appears in the new set. Section 3 reads as follows: (Reading) Article X, Section 3. If after a demit has been issued to any Jester, he is rejected in another Subordinate Court, such Jester. upon his written request within 3 months after the date of his 68 69"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JEST ERS 4 demit or the effective date of this Section whichever is later, shall be reinstated in the Court issuing the demit. Now I want to make this kind of a statement and I think I am right. I don’t think there is a Court in North America that does not have one, two, six or seven, fellows in there that if their names came up now to get in couldn’t get in under any circum - stances in the world. I have been approached at different times by some of the boys in the eastern part of the Country where they tell me they haven’t been able to get a man in for years. They have a bunch of stiff-necked nesters in th~re who won’t vote to put anybody in. They come and cry on my shoulders and go around Robin Hood’s barn and get the man in without a vote. This Committee has turned those down and will continue to do so in my opinion. Jester LOUIS CHACKES: I rise to a point of order, Royal Director. It has been called to my attention that there are news - paper reporters in the anteroom who are taking reports of what is transpiring here. Royal Director OPPENBORN: Royal Property Man. will you see that we are properly tiled. All right, Royal Jesters, if you will give your attention to Royal Jester Williams. Jester AL F. WILLIAMS: They are asking now that if a Jester takes a demit from his own Court and he goes out and he can’t get in some place else, probably turned down, if he comes back within ninety days the Court who gave the demit is abso - lutely ordered to take him back. He may be one of those birds who wouldn’t vote for a Candidate in ten years. That is my idea, that the Court where the demit was granted should have the right to vote as if he were a new member. I am, therefore, moving that this Section that I have referred to, Section 3 of Article X, be amended to read as follows. This would be the new provision. (Reading) Article X, Section 3. If after a demit has been issued to any Jester, he is rejected in another Subordinate Court, such Jester, upon his written request within 3 months after the date of his demit or the effective date of this Section whichever is later, shall be reinstated in the Court issuing the demit, provided that the provisions in Section 5 of Article X shall have been fully complied with. That is, that he has to come in as he did in the first place. I move the adoption. Jester R. STUART ANDREWS: What would happen if the man had not been rejected by another Court and wanted to come back? Jester AL. F. WILLIAMIS: So far as I am concerned I think you have got something there and I think this can be cured probably in another direction. If you will permit me to go back and start over again; I have done that a number of times and don’t feel a bit ashamed. I move that Section 3 of Article X be stricken from the By - Laws so we won’t have any question on it. Jester R. STUART ANDREWS: I second the motion. Royal Director OPPENBORN: Moved and seconded that Section 3 of Article X be stricken from the By-Laws. Any dis - cussion? All those in favor signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. The Chair is in doubt. All those in favor of the motion please stand. Those opposed please stand. The motion is carried. Jester AL F. WILLIAMS: I now move the adoption of the proposed new By-Laws and Constitution as submitted to you and as amended. Royal Leading Man SMITH: Second the motion. Royal Director OPPENBORN: Regularly moved and sec - onded that the new Constitution and By-Laws of the National Court of the Royal Order of Jesters be adopted as amended. Any further discussion on the motion? All in favor signify by saying “aye” at the sound of the gavel. Contrary, if any. Carried unanimously. Jester AL F.

Contrary, if any. Carried unanimously. Jester LOUIS CHACKES: I think this is an appropriate time to say something; you know, “‘The time has come,’ the Walrus said.” There was something brought out that many of us did not pay much attention to. We did go to the trouble of reminding ourselves that nobody applies for membership to this organiza - tion so our members are not voting on Initiates. At every meet - ing of our Court, where there are elections and some of the names turned down, I make a motion in our Court that our records contain no reference to the names of anybody who has been turned down. Here is the reason. Here is Joe Smith, a pretty fair citizen; he didn’t ask to join. Somebody suggested his name and somebody thinks he ought not to come in. So why should there be a blot on his escutcheon or stigma on his character that we show on his record that we turned him down when he didn’t ask to come in? It doesn’t require action here but since the matter has come in I thought I would like to tell you what we do in our Court that you might like to do in yours. Thanks for the use of the hall. (Applause) Royal Director OPPENBORN: I would like to make this ob - servation. I would like to notify the Committee on Ritual that they should make a further report next year. They should have made it years ago. In our Obligation we state that we will never sign the application of anybody to become a Royal Jester. That should be changed. I am very grateful that you adopted the By-Laws as amended. The Committee on By-Laws—and particularly a member of the National Court, our beloved Brother and Royal Jester Stan Gar - rity from Kansas City—has spent many arduous hours in prepar - ing these By-Laws and deserve credit. The more you know him the better you love him. I want him to stand. (Applause) We have another member of the Imperial Council who just came in. Imperial Sir Harold Close of Hartford, Connecticut. (Applause) The Committee on Nominations, Judge Rowe, will you come up to the microphone? Jesters, we are just about on time and we will be through in a little bit. Jester GEORGE H. ROWE: Royal Director, Royal Officers and Royal Representatives. I should like to have the privilege of prefacing my report by stating to you that I was somewhat emo - tional at the time our good friend indicated that he was not going to continue in this Line. In fact, I want to apologize to him, of course, I corrected myself immediately. I was 100% for making him a Representative Ad Vitam and particularly was I affected because I have known him for many, many years. He comes, of course, from Binghamton, New York, and we in the Jesters, as well as in Shrinedom, have interchanged visitations and he has been one of the stalwarts in Shrinedom and also Jesterdom. I am very much upset, of course, that he is retiring. Now, this report I am submitting to you, [might say that by reason of Norm’s resignation there is a vacancy created and there will be two to be nominated and elected to the Royal Line. Those that are ahead of his position in Line, of course, will nat - urally be pushed up one office. Those below will be advanced two positions. Of course, I have known the man that the Committee is go - ing to recommend for your Royal Director for a long time, he having been the attorney for the Imperial Council and for the Hospital Board for some years; and particularly during the years of 1946 and 1947 when I was Imperial Potentate I rubbed shoul - ders with him a great many times. I tried to tell him that be - cause I had been a Judge for about thirty years that I thought I knew a little something about the law but Bob has a wonderful way of sitting down and talking you out of things. I don’t know whether he is going to follow that line when he becomes Royal Director. You don’t have to be afraid of him because although he is serious-looking sometimes, might I say that he has a heart of gold. He likes Coca Cola; so, if you want to get in with him, buy him a bottle of Coca Cola. I submit the following report which is unanimous. REPORT OF THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE It is the unanimous recommendation of the Nominating Com - mittee that all Officers in the line be advanced to the following positions:— 72 73"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THIRTY-EIGHTH ANN (JAL MEETING NATIONAL COURT ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS Robert B.

Because of the resignation of Norman A. Boyd, for reasons of health and the recommenda - tion of his doctor, it is necessary, as I stated before, for this Com - mittee to put in nomination one name for the position of Royal Character IVian and one for Royal Property Man. Your Committee met Sunday afternoon and at that time we invited the four Candidates, whose names I will read to you,— the fifth man was not in the City and was not present—but we got acquainted with these Candidates and I am sure that what I say in furtherance of this report will meet with your approval. There has been presented to the Committee five names, four of’ them by resolutions of their separate Courts to the position of ROYAL PROPERTY MAN. Because of the resignalAon of Nor - man A. Boyd from the Royal Line because of his health and recommendation of his Doctor, it is necessary that this Com - mittee put in nomination, one for the position of ROYAL CHAR - ACTER MAN and one for the position of ROYAL PROPERTY MAN. Your Committee has met with those Royal Jesters that have been recommended for a position on the royal line and find them all to be worthy and well qualified and in our opinion fully capable of discharging the duties of an office in the Royal Line and it is the recommendation of your Committee that Arthur 0. Olson of TULSA COURT No. 47 be presented for your ap - proval as ROYAL CHARCTER MAN and that H. R. “Bud” Fine of FRESNO COURT No. 157 is recommended for your approval as ROYAL PROPERTY MAN, and we heartily recommend Paul W. Miller, Atlanta Court No. 91, David S.
