First, that you should carry nothing 5 offensive or defensive into the Lodge. Second, at the 6 building of King Solomon’s temple there was not heard the 7 sound of an axe, hammer or any tool of iron. The stones 8 were all hewn squared and numbered at the quarries where 9 they were raised; the timbers felled and prepared in the 10 forests of Lebanon, conveyed by sea in floats to Joppa and ii from thence by land to Jerusalem where they were set up 12 with wooden mauls prepared for the purpose; and when the 13 temple was completed its several parts fitted with such 14 exact nicety that it had more the appearance of the 15 handiwork of the Supreme Architect of the universe than of 16 human hands. 17 You were neither naked nor clothed, because Masonry 18 regards no man for his worldly wealth or honor. It was thus 19 to show that it is the internal and not the external 20 qualifications of a man that should recommend him to be 21 made a Mason. 22 You were neither barefoot nor shod. This was in conformity 23 to an ancient Israelitic custom. We read in the book of Ruth 24 that it was the manner in former times concerning 25 redeeming and changing that to confirm all things a man 26 plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor, as this was 27 a testimonial in Israel. This therefore we do to test the 28 sincerity of your intentions in the business on which you 29 were then about to engage. 30 You were hood-winked, with a cable-tow around your neck 31 for three reasons. First, as you were then in darkness so 32 shall you keep the whole world as far as it regards the 33 secrets of Freemasonry, until they shall obtain the same as 34 lawfully as you were then about to do. Second, that your 35 heart might be taught to conceal before your eyes could 36 behold the beauties of Freemasonry. Third, had you refused 37 to submit to the forms and ceremonies of your initiation and 38 been found unworthy to be taken by the hand as a brother 39 you might, by the help of the cable-tow, have been led out of 40 the Lodge without being able to discover even the form 41 thereof. 42 You were caused to give three distinct knocks to alarm the 43 Lodge and inform the Worshipful Master that you were 44 prepared for initiation. And this alludes to a certain text in 45 scripture: “Ask and ye shali receive, seek and ye shall find, 19"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"i knock and it shall be opened unto you.” You asked the 2 recommendation of a friend to be made a Mason; through 3 his recommendation you sought initiation; you knocked at 4 the door of a Lodge and it was opened unto you. s You were received on the point of a sharp instrument 6 piercing your naked left breast, which was to signify, as this 7 was an instrument of torture to your flesh, so may the 8 remembrance of it be to your conscience, should you ever 9 presume to reveal any of the secrets of Freemasonry io unlawfully. ii You were caused to kneel and attend a prayer because no 12 man should ever enter upon any great and important 13 undertaking without first invoking the blessing of Deity. 14 -You were asked in whom you put your trust because, is according to our Masonic institution, no atheist can be 16 made a Mason. It was therefore necessary that you should 17 profess your belief in Deity or no obligation would have 18 been considered binding upon you. 19 You were taken by the right hand, ordered to arise, follow a your conductor and fear no danger. This was to show at a 21 time when you could neither foresee nor avoid danger, that 22 you were in the hands of a true and trusty friend in whose 23 fidelity you might with safety confide. 24 You were conducted once around the Lodge, that all the 25 brethren might see that you were duly and truly prepared. 26 You were caused to meet with three separate obstructions 27 on your passage, because there were guards placed at the 28 south, west and east gates of the courts of King Solomon’s 29 temple to see that none passed or repassed but such as were 30 duly qualified and had permission. It was therefore 31 necessary that you should meet with these several 32 obstructions, that you might be duly examined before you 33 could be made a Mason. 34 You were caused to kneel on your naked left knee, because 35 the left is said to be the weaker part of man. It was thus to 36 show that it was the weaker part of Masonry you were then 37 entering upon, being that of an Entered Apprentice. 38 You were caused to lay your right hand on the Holy Bible, 39 square and compasses, because the right hand was said by 40 our ancient brethren to be the seat of fidelity. The ancients 41 sometimes worshiped Deity under the name of Fides, which 42 was sometimes represented by two right hands joined, at 43 others by two human figures holding each other by the right 44 hand. The right hand therefore we make use of on this 45 occasion to test in the strongest manner possible the 20"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"1 sincerity of your intentions in the business on which you 2 were about to engage. 3 You were requested to deposit something of a metallic kind 4 to remind you of your then extremely poor and penniless s situation and that, should you ever meet a friend (more 6 especially a brother) in like circumstances, that you shall 7 contribute as liberally to his relief as you can without 8 material injury to yourself. 9 You were presented with a Lambskin which is the badge of 10 a Mason. The lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem ii of innocence. He, therefore, who wears the lambskin as the 12. badge of a Mason is thereby continually reminded of that 13 purity of life and conduct which is essentially necessary to 14 his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above where 15 the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. 16 You were then presented with the working tools of an 17 Entered Apprentice which are the twenty-four inch gauge 18 and common gavel. Their uses have already been explained 19 to you. 20 You were next placed in the Northeast Corner as the 21 youngest Entered Apprentice, because in operative masonry 22 the first stone of a building is usually laid in the Northeast 23 corner. You were therefore placed there to receive your first 24 instructions, whereupon to build your future moral and 2S Masonic edifice. 0-1"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"1 ENTERED APPRENTICE LECTURE 2 PART2 3 A lodge is a constitutional number of Masons, duly 4 assembled with the Holy Bible, square and compasses and s charter or warrant empowering them to work. 6 Our ancient brethren met on a high hill or in a low vale, the 7 better to observe the approach of cowans or eavesdroppers, 8 either ascending or descending. 9 The form and extent of a Lodge is an oblong square, 10 extending from east to west, between north and south, from ii the earth to the heavens and from the surface to the centre. 12 It is of such vast dimensions to signify the universality of 13 Masonry and that Masonic charity should be equally 14 extensive. 15 This vast fabric is supported by three Grand pillars called 16 wisdom, strength and beauty, because it is necessary that 17 there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support and 18 beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. 19 These are represented by the Worshipful Master, Senior 20 and Junior Wardens. The Worshipful Master represents the 21 pillar of wisdom, it being supposed that he has wisdom to 22 open his lodge, set the craft at work and give them proper 23 instruction. The Senior Warden represents the pillar of 24 strength, it being his duty to assist the Worshipful Master 2S in opening and closing his Lodge, to pay the craft their 26 wages if any be their due and see that none go away 27 dissatisfied, harmony being the strength and support of all 28 institutions, more especially this of ours. 29 The Junior Warden represents the pillar of beauty, it being 30 his duty in all times to observe the sun at meridian height, 31 which is the glory and beauty of the day. 32 The covering of a Lodge is a clouded canopy or starry- 33 decked heaven where all good Masons hope at last to arrive 34 (by the aid of that theological ladder which Jacob in his 3S vision saw ascending from earth to heaven, the three 36 principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope and 37 Charity, and which admonish us to have faith in God, hope 38 in immortality, and charity for all mankind. The greatest of 39 these is Charity, for Faith may be lost in sight, Hope may 40 end in fruition, but charity extends beyond the grave, 41 through the boundless realms of eternity). 42 The furniture of a Lodge is the Holy Bible, square and 43 compasses. The Bible is dedicated to God, the square to the 44 Master and the compasses to the craft. The Bible is 22"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"1 dedicated to God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to 2 man, and on it we obligate the newly admitted brother. The 3 square to the Master because being the proper Masonic 4 emblem of his office, it is constantly to remind him of the s duty he owes to the Lodge over which he has been chosen to 6 preside, and the compasses to the craft, because by a due 7 attention to their use, they are taught to regulate their 8 desires and keep their passions within due bounds. 9 The ornaments of a Lodge are the mosaic pavement, the 10 indented tessel and the blazing star. The mosaic pavement 11 is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s 12 temple, with a blazing star in the center. The indented 13 tessel, that beautiful tessellated border or skirting which 14 surrounds it. The mosaic pavement is emblematic of human 15 life, checkered with good and evil, the beautiful border 16 which surrounds it suggests those blessings and comforts 17 which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a 18 faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is 19 hieroglyphically represented by the blazing star in the 20 center. 21 All Lodges have three lights, situated east, west and south. 22 None in the North. None in the North because of the 23 situation of King Solomon’s temple, that being situated so 24 far north of the ecliptic that the sun or moon at meridian 25 height could dart no rays in at the northern part of it, so we 26 Masonically term the North a place of darkness. 27 All Lodges have six jewels, three movable and three 28 immovable. The movable jewels are the rough ashlar, the 29 perfect ashlar and the trestle-board. The rough ashlar is a 30 stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural 31 state. The perfect ashlar is a stone made ready by the 32 workman to be adjusted by the tools of the Fellowcraft. The 33 trestle-board is for the master workman to draw his designs 34- upon. By the rough ashlar we are reminded of our rude and 3S imperfect state in nature; by the perfect ashlar, that state of 36 perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous 37 education, our own endeavors and the blessing of God; and 38 by the trestle-board we are reminded that, as the operative 39 workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the 40 rules and designs laid down by the master on his trestle - 41 board, so should we, both operative and speculative, 42 endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the 43 rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of 44 the Universe in the Book of Life or Holy Scriptures, which 4S is our spiritual trestle-board. 23"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"i The immovable jewels are the square, level and plumb. The 2 square teaches morality, the level equality and the plumb 3 rectitude of life. 4 All lodges should be situated due east and west, because s this was the situation of King Solomon’s temple. King 6 Solomon’s temple was so situated, because after Moses had 7 safely conducted the children of Israel through the Red Sea 8 when pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he then by Divine 9 command erected a tabernacle and situated it due east and 10 west in order to perpetuate the remembrance of that mighty ii east wind by which their miraculous delivery was wrought 12 and to receive the rays of the rising sun, and as this was an 13 exact model for King Solomon’s temple, all Lodges should be 14 situated due east and west. 15 In ancient times Lodges were dedicated to King Solomon, 16 because it was said that he was our first Most Excellent 17 Grand Master or he was the founder of our present system, 18 but in modern times they are dedicated to Saint John the 19 Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, who were eminent 20 patrons of Masonry and since their time there is 21 represented in every regular and well governed Lodge a 22 certain point within a circle. The point representing an 23 individual brother, the circle representing the boundary 24 line of his duty to God and man, beyond which he is never 25 to suffer his passions, prejudices or interests to betray him 26 on any occasion. This circle is embordered by two 27 perpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the 28 Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were perfect 29 parallels in Christianity as well as Masonry, and upon the 30 vertex rests the Book of Holy Scriptures, which points out 31 the whole duty of man. In going around this circle, we 32 necessarily touch upon these two lines as well as upon the 33 Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself thus 34 circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially 35 err. 36 The tenets of our profession are Brotherly Love, Relief and 37 Truth. 38 By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to regard the 39 whole human species as one family, the high and low, the 40 rich and poor, who being created by one Almighty Parent 41 and inhabiting the same planet are to aid, support and 42 protect one another. On this principle, Masonry unites men 43 of every country, sect and opinion and conciliates true 44 friendship among those who might otherwise have 45 remained at a perpetual distance. 46 To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, 47 but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an 24"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the 2 unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to 3 compassionate their miseries and to restore peace to their 4 troubled minds is the grand aim we have in view. On this s basis we form our friendships and establish our 6 connections. 7 Truth is a divine attribute and the foundation of every 8 virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught 9 in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate and by its 10 dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. While influenced ii by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among 12 us; sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us; and the heart 13 and tongue join in promoting one another’s welfare and 14 rejoice in one another’s prosperity. is Brother, a Mason is known by certain signs, a token, a 16 word, and the points of his entrance. The sign, token and 17 word have already been explained to you. It now remains 18 for me to explain the points of your entrance, how many and 19 what they are. They are four: the guttural ( @), the pectoral 20 (@),the manual ( @) and the pedal ( @ ), which allude to 21 the four cardinal virtues, temperance, fortitude, prudence 22 and justice. 23 Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and 24 passions which renders the body tame and governable and 25 frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue 26 should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is 27 thereby taught to avoid excess, or the contracting of any 28 licentious or vicious habit, indulgence in which might lead 29 him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has 30 promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would 31 consequently subject him to the contempt and detestation of 32 all good Masons, if not to the Ancient and Symbolic penalty 33 of an Entered Apprentice, which alludes to the guttural. 34 (@) 3S Fortitude is that noble and steady purpose of the mind 36 whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril or 37 danger when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is 38 equally distant from rashness and cowardice and, like 39 temperance, should be deeply impressed upon the mind of 40 every Mason as a safeguard or security against any illegal 41 attack that may be made, by force or otherwise, to extort 42 from him any of those secrets with which he has been so 43 solemnly intrusted. This was emblematically represented 44 upon your first admission into the Lodge, when you were ~s received on the point of a sharp instrument piercing your 46 naked left breast which alludes to the pectoral. (@) 25"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"i Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions 2 agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by 3 which we wisely judge and prudentially determine all 4 things relative to our present and future happiness. This s virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, 6 not only for the government of his conduct while in the 7 Lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be 8 particularly attended to in all strange or mixed companies, 9 and should constantly remind him never to let fall the least 10 sign, token or word whereby the secrets of Masonry might ii be unlawfully obtained, ever bearing in mind your solemn 12 obligation while kneeling at the altar on your naked left 13 knee, your left hand supporting the Holy Bible, square and 14 compasses, your right resting thereon, which alludes to the 15 manual.(@) 16 Justice is that standard of right which enables us to render 17 to every man his just due without distinction. This virtue is 18 not only consistent with Divine and human laws but is the 19 very cement and support of civil society and, as justice in a 20 great measure constitutes the really good man, so should it 21 be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate 22 from the minutest principles thereof, ever remembering the 23 charge you received while standing in the Northeast corner 24 of the Lodge, your feet forming an angle of an oblong 25 square, which alludes to the pedal.

No institution was ever 9 established on a better principle or more solid foundation, 10 nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid ii down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. 12 The greatest and best of men in all ages have been 13 encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never 14 deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves 15 with the Fraternity, extend their privileges and patronize 16 their assemblies. 17 There are three great duties, which, as a Mason you are 18 charged to inculcate — to God, your neighbor and yourself: 19 to God in never mentioning His Name but with that 20 reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator, 21 to implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to 22 esteem Him as your chief good: to your neighbor, in acting 2~3 upon the square and doing unto him as you would wish that 24 he should do unto you; and to yourself, in avoiding all 25 irregularity and intemperance which may impair your 26 faculties or debase the dignity of your profession. 27 In the state you are to be a quiet and peaceful citizen, true 28 to your government and just to your country. You are not to 29 countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to 30 legal authority and conform with cheerfulness to the 31 government of the country in which you live. 32 In your outward demeanor be particularly careful to avoid 33 occasion for censure or reproach.

(*) 17 51"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"1 FELLOWCRAFT DEGREE 2 SECOND SECTION 3 (Senior Deacon) Brother you are now about to make an 4 ascent to a place representing the Middle Chamber of King s Solomon’s Temple through a porch. Masonry is considered 6 under two denominations, operative and speculative. 7 By operative masonry, we allude to the proper application 8 of the useful rules of architecture, whereby a structure will 9 derive figure, strength and beauty and whence will result a 10 due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It ii furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelters from 12 the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons and, while 13 it displays the effects of human wisdom as well in the choice 14 as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an is edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science 16 and industry is implanted in man for the best, most 17 salutary and beneficent purposes. 18 By speculative Masonry, we learn to subdue the passions, 19 act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain 20 secrecy and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with 21 Religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational 22 homage to the Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and 23 our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view with 24 reverence and admiration the glorious works of the 25 Creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of 26 the perfection of his Divine Creator. 27 We work in speculative only, but our ancient brethren 28 wrought in operative as well as speculative Masonry. They 29 worked six days before they received their wages, but did 30 not work on the seventh, because in six days God created 31 the Heaven and the Earth, and rested upon the seventh 32 day. The seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren 33 consecrated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby 34 enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious 35 works of the Creation, and to adore their great Creator. 36 The first thing particularly attracting your attention is a 37 representation of two brazen pillars. The one on the left 38 hand is called Boaz and denotes strength. The one on the 39 right is called Jachin and signifies “He will establish”. They 40 both together allude to the promise of God to David that he 41 would establish his kingdom in strength. 42 The pillars which they represent were cast in the clayey 43 grounds on the plains of Jordan by one Hiram Abif or Abiv, 44 a widows son of the tribe of Naphtali. They were cast hollow 4S the better to serve as a safe repository for the archives of 52"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"1 Masonry against all inundations and conflagrations. They 2 were eighteen cubits high, twelve in circumference or four 3 in diameter, and were adorned with chapiters of five cubits ~ each making in the whole twenty-three cubits high. The s chapiters were adorned with lily-work, net-work and 6 pomegranates which denote peace, unity and plenty. The ~ lily by its purity and the retired situation in which it grows 8 denotes peace, the net-work by the intricate connection of g its parts denotes unity and the pomegranates by the 10 exuberance of the seeds denotes plenty. ii They were further adorned with pommels on their tops 12 representing globes, which denote Masonry universally. The 13 globes are two artificial spherical bodies, on the convex 14 surface of which are represented the countries, seas and 15 various parts of the earth, the face of the Heavens, the 16 planetary revolutions and other particulars. The sphere 17 with the parts of the earth delineated on its surface is called 18 the terrestrial globe and that with the constellations and 19 other Heavenly bodies the celestial globe. 20 Their principal uses, besides serving as maps to distinguish 21 the outward parts of the earth and the situation of the fixed 22 stars, is to illustrate and explain the phenomena arising 23 from the annual revolution and the diurnal rotation of the 24 earth around its own axis. They are the noblest instruments 25 for improving the mind and giving it the most distinct idea 26 of any problem or proposition, as well as enabling it to solve 27 the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with 28 a due reverence for the Deity and His works, and are 29 induced to encourage the study of astronomy, geography, 30 navigation and the arts dependent on them, by which 31 society has so much benefited. 32 (:::::) 33 You next discover a flight of winding stairs, consisting of 34 three, five and seven steps. 35 The number three alludes to the first three Degrees in 36 Masonry, which every Lodge confers. Also to the three 37 principal officers of a Lodge, the Worshipful Master, Senior 38 and Junior Wardens. 39 The number five alludes to the five orders in architecture. 40 By order in architecture is meant a system of all the 41 members, proportions and ornaments of columns and 42 pilasters; or, it is a regular arrangement of the projecting 43 parts of a building which, united with those of a column, 44 form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"From the first formation of society order in architecture 2 may be traced. When the rigors of seasons obliged men to 3 contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we 4 learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid 5 others across to support a covering. The bands which 6 connected those trees at the top and bottom were said to 7 have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, 8 and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more 9 improved art of architecture. io The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, i-i Corinthian and Composite. 12 The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the orders. It 13 was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its 14 column is seven diameters high, and its capital, base and is entablature have but few moldings. The simplicity of the 16 construction of this column renders it eligible where 17 ornament would be superfluous. 18 The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, 19 and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight 20 diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or 21 capital except moldings, though the frieze is distinguished 22 by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the 23 ornaments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order 24 gives it a preference in structures where strength and noble 2S simplicity are chiefly required. 26 The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The 27 several parts of which it is composed are founded on the 28 natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention it was 29 more simple than in its present state. In after times, when 30 it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric, for 31 when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form, 32 the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan 33 preceded the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to 34 .~ that pillar in its original state. 35 The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion between the 36 more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters 37 high, its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has 38 dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in 39 this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the 40 lonians, as the famous Temple of Diana at Ephesus was of 41 this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of 42 an agreeable young woman of an elegant shape, dressed in 43 her hair, as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed 44 after that of a strong robust man. 4S The Corinthian, the richest of the five orders, is deemed a 46 masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its 54"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"1 capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, 2 which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with 3 curious devices, the cornice with dentils and modillions. ~ This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was s invented at Corinth by Callimachus, who is said to have 6 taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the following 7 remarkable circumstance: Accidentally passing by the tomb 8 of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys, covered with g a tile placed over an acanthus root, having been left there 10 by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encompassed ii the basket, till arriving at the tile, they met with an 12 obstruction, and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with 13 the object, set about imitating the figure. The base of the 14 capital he made to represent the basket, the abacus the tile, 15 and the volutes the bending leaves. 16 The Composite is compounded of the other orders and was 17 contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of 18 leaves of the Corinthian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its 19 column has the quarter-round, as the Tuscan and Doric 20 orders, is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentils or 21 simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in 22 buildings where strength, elegance and beauty are 23 displayed. 24 The ancient and original orders in architecture revered by 25 Masons are no more than three: the Doric, Ionic and 26 Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these 27 the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made 28 plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more 29 ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The 30 first three orders alone, however, show invention and 31 particular character, and essentially differ from each other. 32 The other two have nothing but what is borrowed, and 33 differ only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its 34 earliest state, and the Composite is the Corinthian, 35 enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to 36 the Romans we are indebted for what is great, judicious and 37 distinct in architecture. 38 The number five also alludes to the five senses of human 39 nature: hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling and tasting. 40 Hearing is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and 41 are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. 42 By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and 43 reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and 44 intentions, our purposes and desires, while thus our reason 45 is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The 46 wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended by the 47 formation of this sense that we should be social creatures 55"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"and receive the greatest and most important part of our 2 knowledge by the information of others. For these purposes 3 we are endowed with hearing that, by a proper exertion of 4 our rational powers, our happiness may be complete. s Seeing is that sense by which we distinguish objects and in 6 an instant of time without change of place or situation view 7 armies in battle array, figures of the most stately 8 structures, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the 9 landscape of nature. By this sense we find our way in the 10 pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its ii figures and dimensions and delineate any region or quarter -12 of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new 13 discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay more, by it 14 we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and 15 affections of our fellow creatures when they wish most to 16 conceal them so that, though the tongue may be taught to 17 lie and dissemble, the countenance would display hypocrisy 18 to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which 19 administer to this sense are the most astonishing parts of 20 the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object 21 of admiration. 22 Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the 23 eye and its appurtenances evinces the admirable 24 contrivance of nature for performing all its various external 25 and internal motions, while the variety displayed in the 26 eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, 27 clearly demonstrates this organ to be the masterpiece of 28 nature’s work. 29 Feeling is that sense by which we distinguish the different 30 qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and 31 softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion 32 and extension. 33 The first three, hearing, seeing and feeling, are the most 34 revered by Masons, because by the sense of hearing we hear 35 the word, by that of seeing we see the sign, and by that of 36 feeling we feel the grip whereby one Mason may know 37 another in the dark as well as in the light. 38 Smelling is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the 39 various kinds of which convey different impressions to the 40 mind. Animal and vegetable bodies and, indeed, most other 41 bodies while exposed to the air continually send forth 42 effluvia of vast subtlety, as well in the state of life and 43 growth as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. 44 These effluvia being drawn into the nostrils along with the 45 air are the means by which all bodies are smelled. Hence it 46 is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in 47 the Great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the 56"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"1 inside of that canal through which the air continually 2 passes in respiration. 3 Tasting enables us to make a proper distinction in the 4 choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the 5 entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards 6 the entrance to the canal for respiration. From the situation 7 of both of these organs it is plain that they were intended by 8 nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is 9 nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must 10 undergo the scrutiny of tasting, and by it we are capable of 11 discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in 12 the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, 13 pharmacy, etc. 14 Smelling and tasting are inseparably connected, and it is by 15 the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society 16 that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their 17 natural offices. 18 On the mind all our knowledge must depend. What 19 therefore can be a more proper subject for the investigation 20 of Masons? By anatomical dissection and observation we 21 become acquainted with the body, but it is by the anatomy 22 of the mind alone we discover its power and principles. 23 To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God’s 24.. bounty to man, we shall add that memory, imagination, 25 taste, reasoning, moral perception and all the active powers 26 of the soul present a vast and boundless field for 27 philosophical disquisition, which far exceeds human inquiry 28 and are peculiar mysteries known only to nature and to 29 nature’s God, to whom we and all are indebted for creation, 30 preservation and every blessing we enjoy. 31 The number seven alludes to the seven liberal arts and 32 sciences which are grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic 33 geometry, music and astronomy. 34 Grammar teaches the proper arrangement of words 35 according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people, 36 and that excellence of pronunciation which enables us to 37 speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeably to 38 reason and correct usage. 39 Rhetoric teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any 40 subject, not merely with propriety, but with all advantages 41 of force and elegance, wisely contriving to captivate the 42 hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, 43 whether it be to entreat or extort, to admonish or applaud. 44 Logic teaches us to guide our reason discretionally in the 45 general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after 57"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"1 truth. It consist of a regular train of argument, whence we 2 infer, deduce and conclude according to certain premises 3 laid down, admitted or granted, and in it are employed the 4 faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning and disposing, all s of which are naturally lead on from one graduation to 6 another till the point in question is finally determined. 7 Arithmetic teaches the powers and properties ofnumbers, 8 which is variously affected by letters, tables, figures and 9 instruments. By this art, reason and demonstrations are 10 given for finding out any certain number whose relation or 11 affinity to another is already known or discovered. 12 Geometry, or the fifth science is the one which Masonry is 13 more particularly founded. Geometry treats of the powers 14 and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, 15 breadth and thickness are considered. From a point to a 16 line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a 17 solid. A point is a dimensionless figure, or an indivisible 18 part of space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one 19 capacity, namely length. A superficies is a figure of two 20 dimensions, namely length and breadth. A solid is a figure 21 of three dimensions, namely length, breadth and thickness. 22 By this science the architect is enabled to construct his 23 plans and execute his designs, the general to arrange his 24 soldiers, the engineer to mark out ground for encampments, 25 the geographer to give us the dimensions of the world and 26 all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of seas, 27 and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms and 28 provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his 29 observations and to fix the duration of times and seasons, 30 years and cycles. In fine, geometry is the foundation of 31 architecture and the root of mathematics. 32 Music teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose 33 delightful harmony by a mathematical and proportional 34 arrangement of acute, grave and mixed sounds. This art, by 35 a series of experiments, is reduced to a demonstrative 36 science with respect to tones and the intervals of sound. It 37 inquires into the nature of concords and discords, and 38 enables us to find out the proportion between them by 39 numbers. 40 Astronomy is that Divine art by which we are taught to 41 read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the Almighty 42 Creator in those sacred pages, the Celestial hemisphere. 43 Assisted by astronomy we can observe the motions, 44 measure the distance, comprehend the magnitudes and 45 calculate the periods and eclipses of the heavenly bodies. By 46 it we learn the use of the globes, the systems of the world 47 and the preliminary law of nature. While we are employed 58"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"1 in the study of this science, we must perceive unparalleled 2 instances of wisdom and goodness, and through the whole 3 creation trace the glorious Author by His works.

The Ephraimites had long been a 19 - treacherous and rebellious people whom Jeptha had sought 20 to subdue by lenient measures, but without effect. They, 21 being highly incensed at not being called to fight and share 22 in the rich spoils of the Ammonitish war and filled with 23 vengeance, gathered together a mighty army, crossed the 24 river Jordan to give Jeptha battle. But Jeptha, being 25 apprised of their intentions, gathered together the mighty 26 men of Gilead, gave them battle and put them to flight; and 27 in order to make his victory more complete he placed guards 28 at the several passages of the Jordan and commanded 29 them, if any should attempt to pass this way, to demand of 30 them “Say now S-th”, but they being of a different 31 tongue, could not frame to pronounce it right and said 32 Si-h. This trifling defect proved them enemies and cost 33 them their lives; and there fell at this time of the 34 Ephraimites forty and two thousand, since which time this 35 word has been adopted as a password to gain admission 36 into all regular and well governed Lodges of Fellowcrafts. 37 Give me the token. --- (0) 38 The pass is right and the token is right.

After passing the stairs you 25 arrived at the outer door of the Middle Chamber, which you 26 found guarded by the Junior Warden, who demanded of you 27 the pass and token of the pass of a Fellowcraft. You next 28 arrived at the inner door of the Middle Chamber, which you 29 found guarded by the Senior Warden who demanded of you 30 -. the grip and word of a Fellowcraft. 31 You have now arrived at a place representing the Middle 32 Chamber where you are received and recorded as a 33 Fellowcraft and are now entitled to your wages as such, 34 which are the corn of nourishment, the wine of refreshment 35 and the oil of joy, which denote plenty, happiness and 36 peaCe. 37 You are also entitled to the three jewels of a Fellowcraft 38 which are an attentive ear, an instructive tongue and a 39 faithful breast, because the attentive ear receives the sound 40 from the instructive tongue and the mysteries of Masonry 41 are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. 60"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"1 I now direct your attention to the letter “G”, which is the 2 initial of geometry. Geometry, the first and noblest of 3 sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of 4 Masonry is erected. By geometry we may trace nature s through her various windings to her most concealed 6 recesses. By it we discover the power, the wisdom and the 7 goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe and view 8 with delight the proportions which connect this vast 9 machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their 10 different orbits and demonstrate their various revolutions. ii By it we account for the return of seasons and the variety of 12 scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. 13 Numberless worlds are around us, all formed by the same 14 Divine Architect, which roll through the vast expanse, and is are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature. 16 A survey of nature and the observations of her beautiful 17 proportions first determined man to imitate the Divine plan 18 and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies 19 and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design 20 and the plans which he laid down, being improved by 21 experience and time, have produced works which are the 22 admiration of every age. 23 - The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance and the 24 devastations of war have laid waste and destroyed many 25 valuable monuments of antiquity on which the utmost 26 exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the 27 temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent and 28 constructed by the most celebrated artists, escaped not the 29 unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry 30 notwithstanding has still survived. The attentive ear 31 receives the sound from the instructive tongue and the 32 mysteries of Masonry are safely lodged in the repository of 33 faithful breasts. 34 Tools and implements of architecture are selected by the 35 Fraternity to imprint on the memory wise and serious 36 truths and, thus, through a succession of ages are 37 transmitted unimpaired the excellent tenets of our 38 institution. 39 40 The letter “G” further alludes to the sacred name of Deity, 41 to whom we should all, from the youngest Entered 42 Apprentice who stands in the North-East corner of the 43 Lodge to the Worshipful Master who presides in the East, 44 with all created intelligent beings with reverence most 45 humbly bow.

Geometry, or Masonry, originally 23 synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature is 24 enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves 25 the wonderful properties of nature, it demonstrates the 26 more important truths of morality. 27 Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited 28 the honor which we have now conferred and in your new 29 character it is expected that you will conform to the 30 principles of Masonry by steadily persevering in the 31 practice of every commendable virtue.

His death 9 was premeditated by fifteen Fellowcrafts, who seeing the 10 temple about completed and being desirous of obtaining the 11 secrets of a Master Mason, whereby they might travel in 12 foreign countries and receive Master’s wages, entered into a 13 horrible conspiracy to extort them from our Grand Master 14 Hiram Abif or take his life; but, reflecting with horror on 15 the atrocity of the crime, twelve of them recanted. The other 16 three persisted in their murderous designs. 17 Our Grand Master Hiram Abif was slain at high twelve. It 18 was his usual practice at high twelve, when the craft were 19 called from labor to refreshment, to enter into the 20 unfinished Sanctum Sanctorum or Holy of Holies of the 21 Temple and there to offer up his adoration to the Deity and 22 draw his designs on the trestle board. The three 23 Fellowcrafts who persisted in their murderous designs, 24 knowing this to be his usual practice, placed themselves at 25~ the south, west and east gates of the inner court of the 26 temple and there awaited his return. 27 Our Grand Master Hiram Abif having finished his usual 28 exercises, attempted to retire by the south gate, where he 29 was accosted by Jubela, who thrice demanded of him the 30 secrets of a Master Mason or the Master’s Word, and on 31 being refused gave him a blow with a twenty-four inch 32 gauge across his throat, upon which he fled and attempted ~ to pass out at the west gate, where he was accosted by 34 Jubelo, who in like manner thrice demanded of him the 35 secrets of a Master Mason or the Master’s Word and on his 36 like refusal gave him a blow with a square across his 37 breast, upon which he fled and attempted to make his 38 escape out of the east gate, where he was accosted by 39 Jubelum, who in like manner thrice demanded of him the 40 secrets of a Master Mason or the Master’s Word and on his 41 like refusal gave him a violent blow with a setting-maul on 42 his forehead, which felled him dead on the spot. 43 They buried the body in the rubbish of the Temple until low 44 twelve or twelve at night when they met by agreement and 45 carried it a westerly course from the temple, to the brow of 46 a hill west of Mount Moriah, where they buried it in a grave 106"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"1 dug due east and west, six feet perpendicular, in the head of 2 which they planted an acacia, in order to conceal it and that 3 the place might be known should occasion ever require and 4 made their escape.

King Solomon then 18 ordered them to go and assist in raising the body and it was 19 agreed between him and Hiram, King of Tyre that as the 20 Master’s Word was then lost, the first sign given at the 21 grave and the first word spoken after the body should be 22 raised, should be adopted for the regulation of all Master’s 23 Lodges until future generations should find out the right. 24 They repaired to the grave where they raised their hands 25 above their heads and exclaimed “Oh Lord, My God, is there 26 no help for the widow’s son?” 27 King Solomon then ordered one of the Fellowcrafts to take 28 the body by the Entered Apprentice grip and see if it could 29 be raised, but owing to the high state of putrefaction, it 30 having been dead already fifteen days, the skin slipped and 31 the body could not be raised. He then requested the King of 32 Tyre to take it by the Fellowcraft grip, but owing to the 33 reasons before given, the flesh cleaved from the bones and 34 the body could not be so raised. 35 King Solomon then exclaimed “Oh Lord, My God, I fear the 36 Master’s Word is forever lost and my Worthy Brother of 37 Tyre, what shall we do?” 38 He said, “Let us pray.” After prayer King Solomon took the 39 body by the strong grip of a Master Mason or Lion’s Paw 40 and raised it on the five points of fellowship which have 41 been explained to you. 42 They carried the body to the temple from whence they 43 buried it in due form. 44 The body of our Grand Master Hiram Abif was buried three 45 times, first in the rubbish of the temple, second on the brow 108"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"1 of a hill west of Mount Moriah, and third and last as near 2 the Sanctum Sanctorum as the Jewish law would permit, 3 and Masonic tradition informs us that there was erected to 4 his memory a marble monument, consisting of a beautiful s Virgin weeping over a broken column, before her was a book 6 open, in her right hand a sprig of acacia, in her left an urn~ 7 behind her stands Time unfolding her ringlets and counting 8 her hair. 9 The beautiful virgin weeping over the broken column 10 denotes the unfinished temple, likewise the untimely death ii of our Grand Master Hiram Abif.

At the raising of the body of our Grand Master 19 Hiram Abif, our ancient brethren, in token of horror and 20 surprise at the mortified state of the body, thus raised their 21 hands above their heads and exclaimed “Oh Lord, My God, 22 is there no help for the Widow’s son?” Giving this three 23 times and at the same time exclaiming “Oh Lord, My God!” 24 ~constitutes the Grand Hailing sign of distress, which you 2S have solemnly sworn never to give except in cases of the 26 most imminent danger, in a just and legal Lodge, or for the 27 purpose of instruction and if ever you see or hear it given by 28 a brother in distress, you are to go to his relief if there is a 29 greater probability of saving his life than of losing your 30 own.

The Entered Apprentice 7 grip which could not prevail to raise the body owing to the 8 high state of putrefaction, reminds us of mankind in a state 9 of nature, since by the efforts of his own reason, unaided by 10 revelations, he has never been able to prove the immortality ii of the soul. The Fellowcraft grip which could not prevail to 12 raise the body for similar reasons, reminds us of the Jewish 13 Hierarchy, since after searching the book of the law and the 14 prophets, but few passages are to be found which prove in a is clear and undoubted manner the resurrection of the body 16 from the grave. But the strong grip of a Master Mason or 17 Lion’s Paw, which did prevail to raise the body, reminds us 18 of the Christian Dispensation which has brought life and 19 immortality to light, and teaches mankind that through the 20 merits of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, their bodies shall at 21 last be raised and become as incorruptible as their souls. 22 There are three Grand Masonic pillars called wisdom 23 strength and beauty. These are represented by Solomon, 24 King of Israel; Hiram, King of Tyre and Hiram Abif, who 25 were our first three Most Excellent Grand Masters. 26 Solomon, King of Israel, represents the pillar of wisdom, 27 because by his wisdom he erected that stupendous model of 28 excellence which immortalized his name. Hiram, King of 29 Tyre, represents the pillar of strength, because he 30 strengthened King Solomon in that great and glorious 31 undertaking. Hiram Abif represents the pillar of beauty, 32 because by his cunning workmanship the temple was 33 beautified and adorned. 34 The temple was supported by fourteen hundred and fifty- 35 three columns, two thousand, nine hundred and six 36 pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. 37 There were employed in building the temple: three Grand 38 Masters - illustrious artisans; three thousand three 39 hundred Masters or overseers of the work; eighty thousand 40 Fellowcrafts in the mountains and in the quarries, who 41 were engaged during the building of the temple; a levy out 42 of Israel consisting of thirty thousand who wrought in the 43 quarries one month in three, besides Entered Apprentices 44 and bearers of burden. These were all classed and arranged 45 in such a manner by the wisdom of Solomon, that envy, 46 discord and confusion were not suffered to interrupt the 47 universal peace and tranquility which pervaded the world 48 at that important period. 111"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"1 You now behold before you the Master’s carpet. Every 2 figure delineated thereon teaches a lesson of the strictest 3 morality. 4 THE THREE STEPS usually delineated upon the Master’s s carpet are emblematic of the three principal stages of 6 human life: youth, manhood and age. In youth, as Entered 7 Apprentices ~we ought industriously to occupy our minds in 8 the attainment of useful knowledge. In manhood, as 9 Fellowcrafts, we should apply our knowledge to the 10 discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor and ii ourselves, so that in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy 12 the happy reflections consequent upon a well-spent life and 13 die in the hope of a glorious immortality. 14 - THE POT OF INCENSE is an emblem of a pure heart, 15 which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity, and as • 16 this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts 17 continually glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent 18 Author of our existence, for the many blessings and 19 comforts we enjoy. 20 THE BEE HIVE is an emblem of industry and recommends 21 the practice of that virtue to all created beings from the 22 highest seraph in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It 23 teaches us that, as we came into the world rational and 24 intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones, 25 never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures 26 around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve 27 them without injury to ourselves. 28 When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his 29 infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brute creation. 30 He lies languishing for days, months and years, totally 31 incapable of providing sustenance for himself, or guarding 32 against the attacks of the wild beasts of the field, or 33 sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. 34 It might have pleased the Great Creator of Heaven and 35 earth to have made man independent of all other beings, 36 but as dependency is one of the strongest bonds of society, 37 mankind were made dependent on one another for 38 protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better 39 opportunities for fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and 40 friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, 41 the noblest part of the work of God, and he who will so 42 demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the 43 common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be 44 deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of 45 society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons. 112"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"1 THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS guarded by the Tiler’s 2 sword reminds us that we should ever be watchful and 3 guarded in our thoughts, words and actions, particularly 4 when before the enemies of Masonry, ever bearing in s remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and 6 circumspection. 7 THE SWORD pointing to a naked heart demonstrates that 8 justice will sooner or later overtake us, and although our 9 thoughts, words and actions may be hidden from the eyes of 10 man, yet that all seeing eye, whom the sun, moon and stars 11 obey and under whose watchful care even comets perform 12 their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost recesses 13 - of the human heart and will reward us according to our 14 merits. 15 THE ANCHOR AND ARK are emblems of a well-grounded 16 hope and a well spent life. They are emblematic of that 17 Divine ark which safely bears us over this tempestuous sea 18 of troubles, and that anchor which shall safely moor us in a 19 peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling and 20 the weary shall find rest. 21 THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID was an 22 - invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great 23 Pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa and 24 Europe, was initiated into several orders of priesthood, and 25 raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. 26 This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a 27 general knowledge of things, and more especially in 28 geometry or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many 29 problems and theorems, and among the most distinguished 30 he erected this, which in the joy of his heart he called 31 Eureka, signifying in the Greek language, I have found it, 32 and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed 33 a hecatomb, which was a hundred head of oxen. It teaches 34 Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. 35 THE HOUR GLASS is an emblem of human life. Behold, 36 how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are 37 drawing to a close. We can not without astonishment behold 38 the tiny particles which are contained in this machine, how 39 they pass away almost imperceptibly, and yet, in the short 40 space of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man. 41 Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope, tomorrow 42 blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; 43 the next day comes a frost, which nips the shoot, and while 44 he thinks his greatness still aspiring, he falls like autumn 45 leaves, to enrich our mother earth.
