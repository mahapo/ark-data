Cook, who founded this publishing busi - ness in 1867, was unalterably opposed to secret orders. While many of our publications reflect his spirit, our books have been extensively adopted as text books in conferring the secret ‘work of all standard orders, and the publishers, in continuing their sale, believe they are filling a much felt want. In further justification, we submit the following from the pen of a noted Masonic authority. This quotation ‘will naturally apply to treatises upon other secret orders:— “The objection to treatises and disquisitions on Masonic subjects, that there is danger through them of giving too much light to the world without, has not the slightest support from experience. In Eng - land, in France, and in Germany, scarcely any restric - tion has been observed by Masonic writers, except as to what is emphatically esoteric; and yet we do not believe that the profane world is wiser in those coun - tries than in our own in respect to the secrets of Free - masonry. In the face of these publications, the world without has remained as ignorant of the aporrheta of our art, as if no work had ever been ~vi itten on the subject, while the world within—the craft them - selves—have been enlightened and itistructed, and their views of Masonry, (not as a social or charitable society, but as a philosophy, a science, a religion), have been elevated and enlarged."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"PREFACE ‘The truth is that men who are not Masons never i-ead authentic Masonic works. They have no inter - est in the topics discussed and could not understand them, from a want of the preparatory education which the Lodge alone can supply. Therefore, were a wrtrer even to trench a little on what may be con - sidered as being really the ‘arcana’ of Masonry, there is no danger of his thus making an improper revela - tion to improper persons Mackey, Encyc. of Freemasonry, 1887 ed., p. 617.

THE MYSTiC SHRtNE A BRiEF HiSTORY or THE ORDER The Anueiit Arabic Order, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, was itistiruted at Mecca, Arabia, in the year 5459, or ilu year of Otir Lord 1608 The ritual was prepared ,tiid issued at Aleppo, Arabia, by Lottis Maracti, the great Italian translator of Mohammed’s Alkoran ‘1 lie order was revised antI established at Cairo, Egypt, in 5598.

In various cities of Europe, Temples of the Mystic Shrine were instituted sonic years ago, and they are thriving charitable and social organizations. In 1871 one of the foreign representarhes of the order brought the ritual to America and l)haced it in the hands of Dr. Walter M. Fleming, 33rd degree, Sovereign Grand Inspector-General, Ancient and Ac - cepted Scottish Rite, and Eminent Commander of Columbia Commandery No. I, Knights Teitiplar, New York. Dr. Fleming, with other 33rd degree Masons, (including William J. Florence, Edward Fddy, S. C. Campbell, Oswald Merle DAubigne, C. XV. Miller, John A. Moore, William S Patterson, John XV. Sim - mons and Albert P. Moriarty) and nearly all the Knights Templar of Columbia Commanderv No I instituted Mecca Temple No 1, of the Mystic Shrine in New York. Dr. Fleming was unanimously chosen as Grand Potentate (or presiding officer) - For several years this Temple remained inacti~e, owing to the death of some of the leaders, and the lack of interest of the others In 1875 W. J. Florence brought from Europe the Oriental Ritual of the or - der as it was worked in foreign countries. In 1876 he called together the remaining members of the original Mecca Temple No 1. A committee under his leadership was appointed to draft a constitution and ritual for the order in America. The constitution was adopted June 6, 1876 Since Mr Florence, the chairman of the coinniit - tee, and Dr. Fleming, Grand Potentate, were at that time members oF the old burlesque association known as the Sons of Malta, a portion of the ritual of that order was used. Part of the work was adapted from the higher degrees of the Rite of Memphis and the Scottish Rite, and also the Royal Arch and Templar degrees, York Rite, and it was then decided that only Masons of the 32nd degree by the Scottish Rite, or Knights Templar by the York Rite should be eligible to admission to the order. The Mystic Shrine in America is a charitable and social organitation devoted to the welfare of Free - masonry. The Imperial Council is the governing body, with subordinate branches called Temples There are now about one hundred fifty Temples in the United States. One adverse vote or blackball will reject a can - didate for the term of thirteen weeks The initiation fee was originally placed at ten dollars as the mini - mum sum, and the dues were not less than two dol - lars annually. These sums are smaller than the amounts required by the majority of Temples at the present time. The Mystic Shrine is called an Arabic Order, but it is only in a spirit of frolic that Shi iners assume the garb and role of Arabs. They do not worship the Mohammedan Allah, and they do not accept the re - l~gion of Islam. Shriners are all Masons, believing in deity, and they are all liberty-loving Americans Organiced for fun, the Shrine is called a “play - ground for Masons”. Its principles are pleasure, liospiritliry and jollity, without intemperance, coarse - ness or rudeness. It is a mistake to call the Mystic Shrine the highest degree of Freemasonry. It is not a pait of the Masonic Lodge, but it is perhaps the best loved of all the non-Masonic bodies composed of Masons. The order in the United States ntrmbers thousands of members, all enthusiasts at the Shrine of fraternal affection and good-fellowship."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A BRIEF HiSTORY OF THE ORDER 9 8 THE MYSTIC SHPiNE RANK, TiTLES AND POSiTiONS OF OFFiCERs; THEIR COSTUMES AND JEWELS illustrious Grand Potentate, first officer, in the East Costume—Velvet purple robe or domino; flowing slee~es, tiimmed with yellow or gold braid, yellow or gold colored sash, high purple and yellow silk oi satin turban, with crescent of gold and jeweled, jew - eled sceptre with crescent at top.
