The Worshipful Master then makes the following announcement: Brethren, we are about to ballot on the petition of Mr. _____ to receive the degrees of Masonry in this lodge. White balls elect and black cubes reject. Remember your obligation and vote for the good of Masonry.

If the Grand Master cannot attend, he may deputize some competent Past Master to institute the new lodge, or the ceremony may be omitted. After the brethren are assembled, the instituting officer will assume the East.

In the absence of the Master, you will succeed to higher duties; your acquirements must therefore be such that the Craft may never suffer for want of proper instruction.

The Psalmist sings, ‘The days of our years are three score years and ten.” This has come to be regarded as the standard of the usual allotment of the time of earthly existence, and ,“if by reason of strength they be four score years”, we consider that the additional days are the heritage of those that fear the name of the Lord. To be eligible to receive a “Fifty Year” badge of service in Masonry, the recipient must have passed the traditional boundary line and entered upon the years which are the heritage of the faithful and which, of all the years of life, hold the richest and most coveted blessings. The life of a Mason may be divided into three distinct stages. In youth, he serves with enthusiasm. Intolerant of orderly progress, he attempts to right the wrongs of the world by the sheer force of his passionate zeal for service. This stage contributes to progress and keeps our institution a living, vital power in advancing civilization. In middle life, the enthusiast becomes the calm, assured leader among the craftsmen. He has learned the wisdom of restraint and the advantages of following the traveled pathways. He watches for sign posts and proceeds with care, that he may not lead the younger or weaker brethren into paths too difficult for them to follow. This stage gives to our institution its stability, and assures its permanence. Age, the heritage of those who have passed successfully through the previous periods, is the stage of wisdom and reflection. It is the time of fulfillment and the reward for fidelity. Not until man has passed through the turmoil of youth and the plodding, less eventful period of his adult years, can he fully evaluate the true meaning of Masonry, the part it plays in the building of men, the influence of a God fearing institution in a world of selfish striving. Age, then, gives Masonry its meaning and proves its worth.

No person may be interred with the formalities of the Fraternity unless he, before his death, or a relative, or a friend shall have made a request for a Masonic service. Compliance with such a request shall be consonant with the wishes of the immediate family. Having received notice of the death of a brother Master Mason, the Master of the lodge shall confer with the family of the deceased and learn whether a Masonic funeral service is desired. If a Masonic service is requested, the time and the place for the rite shall be mutually determined. A Masonic funeral may be conducted between the opening and closing of an emergent commu - nication of the lodge having charge of the service. If a lodge convenes for funeral purposes, it shall be formally opened as Master Masons and be recorded as an emergent communication. The master will then announce the object of the meeting and allude to the deceased brother as he may deem proper. The lodge shall be closed immediately after the funeral service has been conducted. An emergent communication may be opened for the first funeral of the year and remain open for the balance of that year; on the condition that it must be closed before the Worshipful Master leaves office. For a Masonic funeral service the secretary shall prepare an obituary roll on which shall be inscribed the name, date of birth, age, date of initiation,passing, raising or affiliation, and the date of death of the deceased brother. The obituary roll shall note that the ceremonies were performed by the lodge and may refer to any other matter deemed appropriate or of special interest t6 the lodge. At the proper time, this roll shall be read by the secretary. The Masonic funeral service shall be in addition to the customary religious burial service. The presiding minister of the gospel may exercise the prerogatives commonly conceded to ordained members of the clergy on such an occasion, including the privilege of committal. When there is no committal, suitable language should be used to meet that situation. Whenever possible or expedient, the Masonic funeral service shall be conducted under the direction of the Master of the lodge of which the deceased brother was a member, or under the auspices of the Master of the lodge which performs the rite. Procedure from the lodge to the place of service may be adapted to the circumstances which prevail. The Tyler shall have ready for use the jewels, lambskin, and other properties which are designated for use in the ceremony. 56"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Ceremonies T~e participating officers of the lodge shall wear their respective jewels. A Bible shall be carried by the Chaplain. All Masons who attend the service as a representative group shall wear the Masonic apron in the prescribed manner.

The order of march and the position to be taken at the grave shall be under the direction of the Master of the lodge. Questions of uniformity in procedure shall be determined by the Grand Custodian. Masonic Funeral Service Friends and Brethren, from time immemorial, it has been the custom of the Fraternity of Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons, when requested to do so, to conduct for a departed brother the time honored ceremony of the Order. We have assembled as Master Masons, to offer this tribute of our affection in the memory of our Masonic Brother , thereby demonstrating our past esteem for him and our fidelity to the principles of this fraternal order. Again, we are called to acknowledge the loss of a brother, overtaken by that fate which shall eventually overcome us also. No power or station, no virtue or bravery, no wealth or honor, no tears of friends or kindred, can avert that destiny. This occasion teaches the impressive lesson that, ere long, each of us must pass through the valley of the shadow of death, to be known no more among men. He who is our brother now slumbers in that last unbroken sleep. With him, we have walked the pilgrimage of life; together, we have kept ward and watch in its trials and tribulations. Now he has gone to accomplish, in the profound slumber of death, the destiny of all mankind. As we see those whom we love passing, one by one, from among us, we ponder more deeply the mysteries of the promised land, that land to which so many of our loved ones have already gone. They pass in memory before us in a ceaseless procession, and so it will cohtinue until the end of time. No traveler ever returns. But is this the end of man and aspiring hope of a faithful Mason? No! Blessed be God! The Bible, that Great Light in Masonry, reveals the way of eternal life, and bids joy and hope arise to cheer and sustain the departing spirit. It points beyond the valley of the shadow of death and bids us turn our eyes with faith and confidence to the opening scenes of a vast and boundless eternity.

By it, we are reminded of our high and glorious destiny beyond the grave, and that there dwell in these frail tenements of clay, an immortal spirit over which death hath no power and the grave, no victory. This occasion teaches us that life’s events cannot be foretold, that its mysteries cannot be fully understood, and that its ultimate end is inevitable. Mindful of life’s uncertainty, let us not postpone our preparation for the moment when the summons for our departure shall come, so that we may be ready and unafraid to enter into the presence of that Great Judge to whom the secrets of every life are known. May our remaining years, therefore, reflect boundless charity for our less fortunate neighbor, may our lives give evidence of our faith in the brotherhood of all mankind, and may our hope and confidence in a Divine Providence be rewarded with an eternity for us all. And, when at last, we stand in the presence of the Master, and submit to his judgment our performance of the duties we owe to God, to our neighbors, to our families, and to ourselves, may it be our reward to hear from Him who sitteth as the Judge Supreme, those welcome words: “Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” To you, the family and friends, we express our heartfelt sympathy.

We commit his remains to this place. We commend his spirit to God who gave it. We cherish his memory in our hearts. Let us pray. 0 Lord our God, and our Eternal Father, through your servants and the sacred scriptures, you have revealed to us: “For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” We thank Thee, Dear Lord, for the love that encompasses us, whether in life or in death. In this solemn moment of stress and strain, enable us to hear Thy voice saying “Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am Thy God.” Sanctify to us the hallowed memories of the past, strengthen and uphold us amid the sorrows of the present, guide and sustain us in the journey of the future, so that we may grow in faith, in love and know “the peace of God, which passeth all under - standing.” The Lord Bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.
