DEVELOPMENT OF THE RITUAL 1. There is a well authenticated tradition that, in the early part of the 18th century, Masters of Symbolic Lodges in France held office for life. This was modified later, but the old tradition was preserved in the 200 of the Rite of Perfection dating from 1758 and the self-styled Emperors of the East and West — a Masomc council which, in 1761, issued a patent to Stephen Morin to carry the Rite of Perfection of 25 degrees “beyond the seas and in Amer - ica.” 2. The earliest ritual of the 200 of the Rite of Perfection, in the Archives of this Jurisdiction, is in a collection of manuscript ntuals in the handwriting of Henry Andrew Francken and dated 1783. Francken received these rituals from Stephen Morn of Kings- ton, Jamaica, who deputized him to establish bodies of the Rite of Perfection in the United States. The original Francken manu- script is in the archives of the Supreme Council 330 in Lexington. 3. The title of the 200 in the Francken rituals is “Venerable Master of all Symbolick Lodges, Sovereign Prince of Masonry, or Master ad Vitam.” Part of this title, the nine symbolic lights, the secret work, a fragment of the obligation and certain scattered phrases have been preserved in all the rituals of the 200 of the Ancient Accept Scottish Rite in this Junsdiction. The Francken ritual concludes with a long lecture in question-and-answer form which reviews the symbols of Freemasonry. It was assumed that the mastery of this lecture would qualify the neophyte to be a Mas - ter ad Vitam — a Master of All Symbolic Lodges for life. This title had only a ntualistic, not a factual, significance. Master ad Vitam in the formative years of the Rite, but all followed the Francken pattern: Billeaud (1803), Anonymous (1804), Doszedardski (1805-09), Killian H. Van Rensselaer (1845), Laffon-Ladebat (1856). 5. Albert Pike (1809-91), Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council, ~ for the Southern Jurisdiction, U.S.A., from 1859 to 1891, rebuilt the entire ritualistic structure of the Scottish Rite but conserved the tradition of each ritual. The title of the 200 in the Pike ritual (1855) is “Venerable Master of All Symbolic Lodges.” The virtues represented by the nine sym - bolic lights are interpreted, the examination of the neophyte at the door defines the type of Mason welcomed in the 200 and the ob - ligation emphasizes the qualities of a Master ad Vitam — urban - ity, gentleness and courtesy. The lecture is a scholarly analysis of the qualities of effective leadership. 6. In 1864, the Hays-Raymond ritual was an abridged and improved version of the Pike ritual. In 1866, the addition of a sym - bollc presentation of the gavel recaptured the spirit of the Francken ntual. This 1866 ritual set the pattern for the ceremonial section of the 200. The ntual of 1866 included what is called an “Argument,” a statement which interpreted the meaning of the ceremonial sec - tion of the 200, and which defined the privileges and responsibil- ities of a Master ad Vitam. This “Argument” which perpetuated the oldest tradition of the degree, and published in all rituals since 1866, is an important part of this historical summary: The right to instruct in a Lodge is not only acquired through formal selection by the brethren and subsequent installation, but by the power of Masonic intelligence, which is attained by patient labor and the study of Ma - sonic law, and by the true understanding of the tenets, 4. There was little ritualistic content in the rituals of the 200"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"7 6 Twentieth Degree doctrines, and symbolic legends of the Fraternity. Exem - plification herein is given in bnef, but the candidate is charged, as a Master of all Symbolic Lodges, to preserve Masonry in its primitive purity. 7. In 1896, the ritual of the 200 was enriched by a colorful drama commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Masonic career of Frederick II of Prussia. Historical characters were used in the cast but there was no historical basis for the action. The drama records a visit of Frederick, his entourage and distinguished guests, to a Lodge meeting — on August 14, 1763. In an exchange of Masonic reminiscences, a dramatic story was told of a spy who had gained entrance to a Masonic lodge with a patent which was, in fact, a map of the fortress. The spy escaped, but General Wall- raven — a trusted Prussian engineer — was imprisoned for life for complicity in the plot. Wallraven, brought from his dungeon, exposed Prince de Kaunitz as the spy; Francis I of Austria, friend and sponsor of the Prince, renounced his fnendship; the Pnnce was bamshed and Wallraven’s sentence was commuted to expat - riation. Before closing the lodge, Frederick promulgated the Ordinan - ces of 1762, presented the Double-headed Eagle as the symbol of imperial power in Masonry, established the Hospitaler’s Fund and proclaImed all present to be Masters of All Symbolic Lodges with full powers of visitation and supervision. 8. As an emotional aftermath of World War I, the reaction against Germany brought the Prussian drama of the 200 under cnt - ical review by the Supreme Council of this Junsdrction. In 1922, after two years of study, a new ritual was issued, with a patriotic drama in an American setting. The author, J. Frank Davis, 320, K.C.C.H., a former newspaper editor in Boston, living in San An - tonio, Texas, followed the exact pattern of the Prussian degree and Master ad Vitam used much of the text. In this revised drama, General George Wash - ington, substituted for Frederick, and several officers of the Con - tinental Army are portrayed as guests of a Masonic lodge in Richmond, Virginia, assembled to welcome the Marquis de Lafay - ette who was the guest of the Nation in 1784. Col. Francis Crans - ton of the British Army, an honorable man and Mason, is substituted for Francis I; Col. Beltower, his secretary, for Prince de Kaunitz, and Benedict Arnold for General Wallraven. The plot is the same. Arnold denounces Beltower as a spy but his own plea for mercy is rejected and the privilege of return to the country he betrayed is denied. The incident is not historical, but the lesson taught in the drama is always timely: ‘Treason is a crime over which Ma - sonry casts no mantle of charity.” NOTE In 1936, the Prologue and Epilogue of the 200, portraying the drama as a dream, were approved for experimental use but were not adopted as an integral part of the ritual. (1936 N.M.J. 98) Three years later, formal adoption was rejected but, on recon- sideration, permission for optional use was granted. (1939 N.M.J. 123) Prologue and Epilogue were withdrawn by action of the Su - preme Council, September 26, 1951. 9. The ritual of 1939, issued in a limited edition, was not gen - erally distnbuted. To conserve the emotional climax of the drama and to close the degree soon after the exit of Arnold, the presenta- tion of the flag of 1777 was moved forward to a point soon after the opening of the drama. 10. The ritual of 1951 is a repnnt of the 1939 ritual —with several important changes. It includes historical notes on the de - velopment of the 200, brief biographical sketches of the historical characters in the drama, and a Manual of Pronunciation. There is a clarifying distinction between a meeting of a Lodge of Mas• ters conferring the Scottish Rite degree of Master ad Vitam in a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 Twentieth Degree ceremonial section, and the non-historical drama with its setting in Richmond, Virginia, in late November 1784. The ceremonial section has been abndged by the deletion of repetitive material. There are a few textual changes in both sections and provision has been made for closing the drama immediately after the climax. 11. The Ritual of 1994 is a reprint of the 1951 ritual with changes made in the interest of historical accuracy, including those recommended in 1981. General Israel Putnam of Connecticut was substituted for General Nathamel Greene of Rhode Island and Gen - eral John Sullivan of New Hampshire for Colonel Alexander I-Tam - ilton of New York. This substitution was to make certain that these two characters were portrayed by officers known to be Masons. The recent discovery of creditable evidence indicating Lafay - ette was made a Mason in France before he came to America re - quired minor revisions to the applicable script. In addition it confirms the accuracy of John Hancock’s attend - ing the Tenth Continental Congress at Trenton as stated in the 1951 ritual. In conformity with the long established policy of the Supreme Council, the degree now provides: “If the Consistory has been officially opened and the cover obligation has been administered, the Opening and Obligation of of this degree may be omitted and the Prologue followed by the Allegory presented.” Master ad Vitam 9 DECORATIONS & PROPERTIES The 200 is exemplified in one apartment, on the floor or stage. Only a slight readjustment is required for the dramatic section. The traditional hangings are blue and gold. Over the East, lighting the lodge, is a “glory” — rays of gold surrounding a tri - angle, in the center of which are the words: Fiat Lux. The setting, including the stations of the Officers, follows the pattern of a Symbolic Lodge. In the center is an altar, an open Bible, square and compasses. A gavel on the altar near the Bible. Three columns around the altar form a triangle. On the column in the East is the word TRUTH, in the West, JUSTICE, in the South, TOLERATION At the station of each Officer, except the Tiler, there is a ped - estal. GAVELS Upright gavel (maul) on the Master’s pedestal; reg - ular gavel on altar. Omit candles. APRON Yellow, bordered and lined with blue. In the center of the area are three equilateral triangles, one within the other, with the initial letters of the nine great lights, arranged as follows: At the apex of the outer triangle, the letter C (Charity). At the right hand corner below, G (Generosity); at the left hand cor - ner, V (Veneration). At the apex of the middle triangle, H (Heroism); and at the right and left hand corners, P (Patriotism), and H (Honor). At the apex of the inner triangle, T (Toleration); and at the nght and left hand corners, T (Truth) and J (Justice). In the center of the inner triangle is the Tetragrammaton and across it, from below upward, the words: Fiat Lux.

Non-essential repetitions and ritualistic matter not relevant to the initiation of a Master ad Vitam have been deleted from the ceremonial section. The “Opening” and “Closing,” used for many years, have been withdrawn. The Scottish Rite section of the 200 is now compact, dignified and impressive. No additional cuts or changes in sequence are approved. Techniques of exemplification prescribed in this ritual should be adapted to local conditions in each Consistory. Stage settings and stage “business” are the concern of the Officers and Direc - tors of Work. No permission is required for any divergence from ritual in this respect. The drama of the 200 is developed within the framework of a tiled meeting of a Symbolic Lodge. Innovations which would be out of place in such a meeting are not permitted. For this rea - son, “The Spirit of ‘76,” in the ritual of 1939, has been deleted. The introduction of a color guard and over-emphasis of Arnold’s lameness or facial scar detract from the dignity of the drama. Un - due uneasiness manifested by Beltower, calling attention to him - self, destroys the dramatic suspense and betrays prematurely that culpnt’ s guilt. Restraint is urged in the interpretation of Lafayette. A tall, red-haired, wealthy young aristocrat, Lafayette had the polished manners of the French court and the democratic spirit of Amenca. In 1784, he could speak English rather fluently, though wlth a slight accent. It is better to use the English text. No one should attempt an imitation unless he is a master of French idiom and accent. Master ad Vitam MANUAL OF PRONUNCIATION Phonetic spelling, with accented syllables in small capitals.

You know that he declined the office, not because he did not appreciate it and the spirit in which it was tendered, but because, as a Mason who for many years had cherished the ancient rules of the Craft, he believed it improper for one to be seated as Grand Master who had never filled the office of Master of a subordinate lodge. I feel, my brethren, that tonight should mark an exception to the ordinary rule, and insofar as the program which I pro - pose differs from ordinary Masonic usage, I hereby legalize it by special dispensation.

Continues Rises when Apron is presented It is with peculiar pleasure, brethren, that I, for the first time, wield the gavel in a Masonic lodge here in Virginia, where for thirty-one years [have endeavored to assist in building the struc - ture of Freemasonry. I was initiated an Entered Apprentice in the Lodge at Fredericksburg in November, 1752, was passed to the degree of Fellowcraft in March of ‘53, and in August of that year was raised 10 the sublime degree of Master Mason. During the years preceding the war I was prevented by other labors from being as active in the fraternity as inclination would have urged, Fredericksburg being the nearest lodge to my home at Mt. Vernon, and that fifty miles distant. But with the out - break of war — and the honor of my fellow-countrymen then conferred upon me — I was able to come into closer touch with my Masonic brethren. What share Masonry had in the conflict that is now so happily past is familiar history to all of you. Our meeting here tonight is due to the visit to this country by our dear brother, General Lafayette. Since his arrival in Amer - ica in August, he has visited many cities in our country, and his reception has been one round of grateful ovations. Now, on the eve of his return to France, he will spend a few days at my home, and these fellow-soldiers and brother Masons have traveled from distant States and accompanied him here as a mark of their affection and esteem. I present to you our good brother whom all America delights to honor — General Lafay - ette ~ Lafayette — It is with a heart overflowing, my brethren, that I respond to the words spoken by this great and good man toward whom my feelings are not those of a fellow-soldier, not those of a subordinate officer, but those of a son. It was my good fortune to serve with him through many weary years. I have seen him when victory was with our armies, and I have seen him when the sadness of defeat enshrouded us and when one who put less trust in the justice of heaven, might have aban - doned the cause. Throughout all these years he was the wise commander, the generous friend and the sincere Mason. Only those who were close to him can appreciate the trials through which he passed. Not all Americans were loyal; many were faint-hearted, and many became lukewarm and dis - couraged. You know how he met this. Insofar as lay in his power, he placed only Masons on guard His especially trusted officers were selected from our fraternity. Thus Freemasonry did more than its share toward winning America’s freedom. In a month, brethren, I shall have left your shores. Perhaps I may never return. l3ut America and Americans shall always have my esteem, my love and my admiration. And more espe - cially shall I love and revere George Washington, great man and Mason. I have brought with me from France this Masonic Apron, made by me dear wife, the Marquise de Lafayette, and sent with her grateful thanks and loving greeting to my Brother in Masonry, George Washington. Let me, my Brother, clothe you with this symbol of Masonic service. (Clothes him with replica"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"26 Twentieth Degree Master ad Vitam 27 of Lafayette apron.)

Washington — Such words, from one toward whom I feel the affection of a father, fill me with deepest emotion. I shall never forget my delight when General Lafayette came to me and expressed his desire to join in our struggle for freedom, nor my pleasure on learning that he was a member of our Craft This Apron shall ever be treasured among my dearest posses - sions, a memorial to our Masonic unity in service. I shall hold in grateful remembrance the kindness of the gracious lady whose hands wrought it. I now have a very pleasant duty to perform.

Masons have died for this flag Masons have striven for the new country that this flag represents. Masons, I doubt not, will ever prove loyal and devoted to it, and to the Freedom for which it stands. We are still a young and struggling people. I dream of a day when we shall be a Nation, rather than a mere confederation of States. A Nation, one and indivisible, whose duty and de - ltght it shall be, through all the centuries, to exemplify to the world the blessings of true and perfect liberty. In the coming years the poor and oppressed from many alien peoples will flock to this free land. It is possible that ignorance, vice and shame - ful greed may seek to assail our Institutions, to destroy our Lib - erties and to poison the fountain of Justice and Equity. But so long as Freemasonry stands uniled in bonds of Brotherhood, the stalwart defender of Liberty in Law, ihis Republic shall en - dure in honor. “So mote it be!” (Pause) — Brethren, be seated. * Washington seated Continues Brother Lafayette refers to days that were dark None were darker than those at Valley Forge, and during those days our young friend was a tower of strength at my right hand. But these are bright days for our new country, let us not dwell upon the dark ones. General Putnam, the brethren would be glad to hear from you. Putnam — I bring to the fraternity in Virginia the greetings of the Freemasons of Connecticut. As your great citizen, Pa - trick Henry, said to the First Continental Congress “Where are your landmarks, your boundaries of colonies?. . The dis - tinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers and New Englanders are no more: I am not a Virginian, but an Amer - ican.” (Applause) Washington — General Knox. Knox — During my tour with General Lafayette, I often re - gretted that more distinguished representatives of my state could not have been present to represent the fraternity. Massachusetts Masons and Masonry have an honorable record in the earliest days of the late conflict, under the guidance of our lamented Past Grand Master, General Joseph Warren, who, at the time of his tragic but heroic death at Bunker Hill, was Provincial Grand Master. Our good brother, John Hancock, would have been with us tonight could he have left his duties as member of the Tenth Con - tinental Congress, now in session at Trenton. It was also a source of deepest regret to Brother Paul Revere that a combination of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"events prevented his leaving Boston at this time, and he asked me to give all Masons his most affectionate greetings. It may not be amiss for me to indulge in a slight but perhaps significant Masonic reminiscence. No man has ever divulged the names of the participanis in the exploit of ‘73, when the tea was thrown overboard in Boston Harbor, and you never will know from the lips of any man that participated in that adventure. This, however, it may be proper For me to say: that, for the first lime in its history, although the regular meeting night, there was no quorum present thai evening at the Lodge of St. Andrew, of which General Warren was a Past Master, and Brother Paul Revere a zealous and active member (Laugh - ter and applause) Putnam — I think it would be of interest and profit to some of the younger brethren were an account to be given of our Military Lodges, in which, during the eight years of our strug - gle, many of out best-loved and most distinguished brethren received Masonic Light, and our Craft was enabled to do much service for the country I recall, for instance, that scarcely had we gathered for the siege of Boston before an army Lodge was opened at Roxbury by Colonel Gridley, who was Deputy Grand Master of Massachusetts. You honored that Lodge wilh your presence, General Washington, accompanied, I think, by two of your aides, although their identity has slipped my mind.

One of them is Sir Francis Cranston, late Colonel in the British army, the other is Colonel Beltower, his secretary. Sir Francis Cranston says he has sat in American Lodges before the war, and hopes there may be some brother here who can vouch for him. If not, he asks that a committee be appointed to inquire into his qualifications. Washington —The name of Colonel Francis Cranston is well known to me as that of a good and true Mason, but it has never been my fortune to sit with him in a Masonic lodge. Randolph — I am quite certain, Worshipful Masler, that I sat with the English brother in 1774. With your permission, I will retire and see whether or not I can identify and vouch for him.

Although it was the fate of war that two years ago we were enemies, I assure you, you are tonight in the company of friends. Cranston — I thank you, sir, for those sentiments, which are such as I should expect from your lips.

On the evening prior 10 the evacuation a meeting was held of the Brit - ish lodge of which I was then Master, and of which Colonel Beltower was Senior Warden. While the Lodge was still at la - bor, word came to leave the city. In the haste and confusion that followed, the paraphernalia and recoids of our Lodge were left behind. Before I discovered their absence, we were miles from Philadelphia and I felt that they were forever lost. I do nol need to tell you, honored sir, what followed, but your breth - ren may not be so well informed. When your forces entered Philadelphia, the records of our Lodge fell into their hands They were handed over to you, and you had them placed with your baggage train and, after the campaign in New Jersey, when our army had reached New York, you sent them to me from White Plains, under a flag of truce, with the truly Masonic message that “ihe American army did not war against works of benev - olence and charity” to thank you in person, not only for myself, but for Masonry in England which I assure you appreciates so fraternal a courtesy. Cranston seated Washington — It was a small thing, Worshipful Brother; nev - ertheless, I am glad the spirit that prompted me found a response in your heart. As you entered, we were about to hear a few words regard - ing the Military Lodges in our armies during the late war. Gen - eral Gist, as Master of a Military Lodge, you were one of our most active brethren throughout the struggle. Will you speak of some of your experiences during that time? Gist — Among the Masonic events that stand out most dis - tinctly in my memory is the meeting of American Union Lodge, held at Morristown, late in December, ‘79, to observe the fes - tival of St. John the Evangelist. As one of those piesent, you will recall the occasion. The exercises were filled with a spirit of patriotism and devotion to the cause of liberty. After you and General Lafayetle had retired on that evening, I was ap - pointed chairman of a committee to communicate with all the American Grand Lodges and propose to them — notwithstand - ing your former declination to accept ihe posilion of Grand Mas - ter of Virginia — that you be invited to become National Grand Master of the United States. The exigencies of war and ihe un - settled conditions of those times prevented the matter from be - ing acted upon by all the States. As a matter of interesting information, I might say there were present at that Lodge meeting no less than sixty-eight officers of the Continental Army. I recall, in addition to a number here present tonight, our good brethren General Philip Schuyler of New York, General John Glover of Massachusetts, Colonel James Monroe of Virginia — and that forsworn and unhappy Washington — You honor us by your presence.

The soldiers lived in little huts, and they had no floors but bare ground to sleep upon Few had shoes Many were without adequate clothing There was little food, no horses, no wagons, no money The army could pay for sup - plies, only with certificates, which Congress had not voted to redeem. One man out of three in those days was a sympathizer with the King, and the farmers in the vicinity ofien preferred to take their food to Philadelpia, twenty-four miles away, where it would be paid for in British gold. It was a true word that General Washngton wrote to the President of the Continental Congress, then sitting at York, when he said: “Nothing, sir, can equal their sufferings, except the patience and fortiiude with which the faithful part of the army endure them The faithful part of the army! That is a phrase to remember, brethren. The tribulations of his soldiers and the seeming hope - lessness of the war were always distressing to our Commander- in-chief, and often he did not know where to look for loyalty and support.

And then came that night, when we discovered that a Mason — a British Ma - son — was taking advantage of his membership in the Craft to spy on us. Cranston — I recall that you got me word of this matter at the time, Brother Washington, but I replied to you that I was convinced no member of any of our lodges was guilty. I hope Brother Lafayette is very sure of his facts. This is a serious charge to make against British Masonry. 1-’ Lafayette — In the warmth of my feelings, I had quite for - gotten that British Masons were also guests, and I most ear - nestly crave their pardon for having referred to a matter that tact would have left unmentioned. Cranston — On the contrary, I am as desirous as any man of having so grave a charge investigated, and would be grateful if you or some other brother can now inform me as to the exact evidence that appeared to prove so serious an accusation. Beltower — Worshipful Master, I find thai I have forgotten an important matter which should have been attended to much earlier. May I be excused for a time? I shall endeavor to return. Cranston — Stay, brother. It seems to me no errand could be so important as the solution of the charge made by Brother Washington in ‘77 regarding the Masonic spy discovered at Valley Forge. As my Senior Warden at that time, I deputed to you the investigation within our ranks, which I asked you to make full and complete. man whose name is nevermore uttered in a Masonic Lodge~ Lafayette — Well as I recollect that happy occasion, my me - mory finds more to thrill it in the struggles of our fraternity during that awful, soul-searching winter which we spent at Val - ley Forge.

Well do I remember that when my enemies offered you the command of a new invasion"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"34 Twentieth Degree Beltower .— And such investigation was made, and produced no evidence whatever that the charges were true. From that day I put the matter out of my mind, confident that it had no basis in fact, and in truth at this moment I scarcely recall any of the details. Cranston — Then be seated and we will bear them, if our American brethren will be so courteous. Beltower resumes his seat. Washington — You, General Putnam, were present at the Lodge on the occasion referred to. Can you tell us of the oc - currence? Putnam — Not of my own sight and hearing, as I was within the Lodge when the exposure of the knave took place in the anteroom. But it chances that one is here who is better able than anyone else to tell the tale. I had great pleasure in renew - ing my acquaintance with him only this evening. Brother Gerry, now a member of this Lodge, was Tiler at Valley Forge and into his hands fell the documents that proved the impostor’s guilt. Gerry —Worshipful Master and Brethren: It will be remem - bered that we met, at Valley Forge, in a barn, and upon the threshing floor a Lodge was set up. The anteroom, in which I tiled, was a small harness rcom at the corner. On the evening referred to, the Lodge had already opened, when several brethren appeared simultaneously. Three or four of them were known to me; but one was a stranger. I suppose he had been waiting outside to enter with a company, hoping the Lodge might be carelessly tiled. He wore such clothing as a farmer of the neighborhood might be expected to wear and I might not have especially noted him during my questionings (which proved that he was a Mason well -versed in the secrets of the Craft) but for the fact that his 35 Master ad Vitam accent was that of an educaied Englishman, rather than that of his apparent class and occupation. I asked to see his patent, and he hastily drew from his clothing a folded paper. I had no more than begun to unfold it when, with a cry, he attempted to seize it, exclaiming that he had made a mistake and that this — he held out another paper — was the patent. I took the sec - ond paper from his hand, but my suspicions were aroused and I continued to unfold the first. With an imprecation, he again attempted to seize it, then, as the other brethren turned at the disturbance, he leaped through the window at my side. I shouted to the guards outside the building, but a heavy fog prevailed, into which he disappeared. The first paper, which he inadvertently gave me, was a rough but accurate map of our fortifications on the east side of our camp. The other was a genuine Masonic patent, issued to one Thomas Murdock of Pennsylvania. Putnam — The matter was at once investigated. We learned that Thomas Murdock had been a Mason in good standing, a member of Miles’ Pennsylvania Battalion; but he had long ceased to possess, or need, that patent. He was captured in Au - gust, ‘76, when General Howe seized New York, and was con - fined for some months aboard the prison ship “Jersey.” When finally released, he had so wasted that he soon after died. Before his death, however, he informed his Masonic brethren that upon the day of his capture he was brought before an officer — a captain in the British army — who conversed with him Ma - sonically, took his patent from him, and assured him that by means of it he would secure his speedy freedom. He never again saw either the patent or the British officer. Cranston — This seems almost incredible. Beltower — [t is incredible. You have recalled, Sir Francis,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"36 Twentieth Degree Master ad Vitam 37 that when General Washington sent to you, in Philadelphia, a brief account of these charges, you instructed me to ascertain what truth was in them. I was unable to learn that they had any foundation. The scope of my investigation now comes back to me. No British Mason who was in New York in August, ‘76, and in or near Philadelphia in the winter of ‘77 — and we knew them all, you and I, for we were in both places —was likely to have done such an act, nor could I find that any Mason was then engaged in espionage for our army... And now that we have heard the story, permit me to depart. In leaving our inn, I left certain papers and despatches where they might be found by ill-intentioned persons and Cranston — That risk is very small, Brother Beltower, and to leave so soon would be hardly courteous. As you came with me, pray wait and depart in my company. Beltower resumes seat. (To Washington) — It is humiliating to think that any British Mason could so demean himself even in the stress and bitter - ness of war, as to use his connection with our Craft to such an end. Putnam — Investigation proved this false Thomas Murdock had gained entrance to camp by exhibiting his patent to a Ma - son, a rather simple fellow, who was on guard at the outer for - tifications with Morgan’s Virginia Riflemen, and had told him he was a discharged American soldier desirous of visiting the Lodge. This was early in the day, and that unsophisticated Ma - son entertained him — and gave him full opportunity to gain the information shown by the map that he left in the Tiler’s hands. Sullivan — (Returning from door) There is, in the anteroom, a brother for whom the Tiler can vouch, accompanied by a pro - fane. The well-tried and worthy brother asks that this commun - ication be handed you at once. Gives Washington foided paper. Washington reads. Washington — Alas! that on what should be wholly a happy occasion, we cannot leave behind us the unsavory memories of treachery. It is most strange that this messenger arrives at a time when this Lodge is in session and just when we have been discussing unfit and forsworn Masons. Our English brother has been grieved to think that in all the body of British Masonry there was a man so vile as to do the thing that was done that day at Valley Forge. But he is aware, as are all the others here, that we Americans also have had our unworthy ones. There is a man — he was once an honored Mason — who fell from honor. His crime was black and dastardly. He no longer lives within the borders of our country, and Freemasons have endeavored to forget him. But he does not wish to be forgotten. Several months ago I received a letter from this unhappy man. He said he wished to return to America; that he sought to make his peace with his former brethren. He appealed to me to use my influence as man and Mason. He asked only a hearing. I would have ignored the letter, but in the closing sentence he said: “I demand this in the name of Justice, of Toleration and of Masonic Charity.” Thus demanded, I felt I could not refuse. I replied to him that if he desired to come to America, I would have him met at the shore, and, so far as lay in my power, would see that he received safe conduct to come before a Masonic tribunal, and to return unharmed. Sullivan — An alarm, Worshipful Master. The Masonic brother whom [sent to meet him has arrived"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"38 Twentieth Degree Master ad Vitam and has brought him instantly to this Lodge. By what seems a Providential dispensation, there chance to be assembled in this room the very men before whom his plea should come.

However abhorrent his offense, I conceive it to be our duty to let no man go unheard who bases his plea on Masonic Justice, Toleration and Charity. Pauses All show interest. There is no reply.

Why should I be ex- cepted from such amnesty? (Pause) Washington — Go on. We listen. Arnold — And listen coldly! Is this your vaunted Masonic Charity, to receive a brother’s plea with the ear only, and not with the heart? I may have erred. I did err. But now I ask you to let the dead past bury its dead.

Never, General Washing - ton, did you recognize me as I deserved — and perhaps in that lies some explanation of my conduct. At a moment when I was serving the Colonies with all my heart and soul you rebuked me publicly. Washington — Not from any wish of mine but by order of the court-martial which had tried and sentenced you to that re - buke. o Arnold — But has it never entered your thoughts that there might be more than one story to the unfortunate happening at West Point — Washington — Hold! What happened at West Point was re - viewed by a court-martial of fourteen generals — the court- martial that tried the unhappy Major John Andre. You have spoken here of justice. Was it justice to allow that brave young man to die, when you could have saved his life? o Arnold — How, except at the risk of my own? American. Had this man been willing to give the order to the boatman to return him to his ship, Andre would have reached his own lines in safety, although at what a cost to us! But his selfishness forbade it, and Andre had to depart by land. Further, it was by this man’s demand that Andre changed his uniform to civilian clothing, but for which he would not have suffered the extreme penalty. Sullivan — How well I remember that morning when our Commander-in-Chief, arriving at West Point from Hanford, learned of this plot against us. Andre had been captured but the traitor had escaped and was safely within the British lines. Turning to General Knox and me, who were with him as he scanned the damning papers, he cried, in agony of soul: “Our Masonic brother! Whom can we trust now!” Can mercy, for him, be spoken of in the same breath with Justice? Knox — I, too, was a member of that court-martial, and when this suppliant asks to have his conduct placed on the same plane as the honest loyalty of British subjects and faithful Tories, he asks us to forget — or rather to ignore — that he received for his services in offering to give up West Point, a commission as Brigadier-General in the British army and gold to the amount of more than six thousand pounds sterling. ~ Arnold — I admit I have sinned, and my passion has often controlled my better nature. But all is not told. I was tempted — tempted by an accursed, smooth-tongued Masonic brother. He still is honored and respected. But six months ago I met him on the streets of London — and he passed me without a word or look of recognition. Shall the tempted pay more pe - nalty than the tempter? . . . Will you hear the story?

You know that the attack was led by General Montgomery, also a Masonic brother, and myself. Montgom- ery was killed at the first fire, and I was seriously wounded while leading my men over the first barricade. As I fell, a Brit - ish officer leaped toward me, through the whirling snow, to put me to the sword. In my desperation I cried aloud the Grand Masonic Words that are to be spoken only in times of deadly pain or peril. He diverted his sword, dragged me away from the barricade, and, after whispering his name and hearing mine, turned back into the fight. Soon after, I was carried to the rear by my men. There came a later time when he reminded me of this. It is a longer story thaAI need tell or you would care to hear, but two years afterwards, while the army was wintering at Valley Forge, he met me outside our lines and we held Masonic con - versation. At the time I deba~e~l whether I ought to expose him to our Craft, for I knew he ~ha~~n American patent with which he was gaining admission to Army Lodges — the patent of some Pennsylvania Mason named Merton — or Murdock —or some such nam~, which he had come by I know not how. But he had ~ life. ,~ When I was in command at West Point, he began the con - versations that finally seduced me. The things he said would hardly interest you, but they were the very words needed to unsettle my loyalty. He pointed out to me that my courage and ability had never been appreciated in the Continental Army. And they had not! I, more than anyone else, won the Battle of Saratoga, and Gates was given all the honor. I had been court - martialed and rebuked for what was no fault of mine. I had been subordinated to officers not as able or as brave as I. He reminded me of this, and many other things he said — words that inflamed my already surging heart. And he whispered that only among cultured men, such as the leaders of the British, could I find the recognition I deserved. And that in British Ma - sonry I would be honored and elevated in recognition of my true worth and talents. . .Why need I recount all these details? I yielded. The meetings with Andre followed. Pause No reply • But, hear this! My punishment is greater than I reckoned on, and more than I deserve. I am a Brigadier-General in the British Army. When orders are to be given to me, my superiors give them. When orders are to be taken from me, my officers receive them. But neither superiors nor subordinates exchange one word with me, except officially. I have no friends, no in - timates, no associates. I am ostracized. Sneers follow me. Men point and whisper as I pass. Masonic Lodges will not admit me, and Masons will not take my hand. Yet this tempter —this vile and forsworn Mason who led me to do what I did —this man who felt himself too good to speak to me upon the public street — he is an honored officer of the Crown, as he was an honored Senior Warden of a British Army Lodge —And his name — Beltower — (Leaping to his feet) It is a lie! ‘~ Arnold — Ha! Beltower! Now, when I see you here, whom I thought in England, do I really believe there is a divinity that shapes our ends! It is not a lie, and in the workings of your face these men and Masons can see it is the truth! As deep a truth as e’er was spoken in Masonic Lodge. (To all.) There stands the man! Beltower — If I but had a sword — • Arnold — It will overjoy me to meet you, sword in hand, at any time and place. You thief of honor, suborner of perjury and treason —"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"44 Twentieth Degree Washington — Enough of this. You shall not quarrel here. Gerry — (Rises, looks closely at Beltower) Now I see, Gen - eral, that this man (pointing to Beltower) is truly that spy who visited the Lodge at Valley Forge. Until this moment, I had not seen him clearly. Beltower — These charges are arrant nonsense. I — Cranston — Even if there were no sufficient evidence to prove their truth, your countenance convicts you. Beltower attempts to speak Silence! Beltower hangs his head. Pause Beltower, you are no longer an associate of mine, nor will you be in the service of His Majesly our King longer than it takes me to send the necessary d4spatches. Also I shall make it my duty to see that this matter comes before our British Ma - sonic superiors — with what outcome you can judge as well as I. If I were you, I should not return to England; nor should I remain in America. Perhaps, in some distant island of the sea, you may find time and place to expiate your treachery to our Craft, although I would suggest that your pistol and your own hand would bring to a speedier end a misdirected life. Beltower — You threaten me with — Cranston — I promise you the ostracism that has been awarded this man, whose name is not spoken where Masons congregate. You are a false man and Mason, Beltower, a liar, a scoundrel and a knave! Beltower — For that insuli my seconds shall wait upon you. Cranston — Any challenge from you will receive no reply. I fight only with gentlemen.. . If our hosis are willing, you may go. I fl, Master ad Vitam 45 Washington nods agreement Beltower hesitates, shnigs his shoulders and starts toward door. His rage overcomes him and he turns and shakes his fist at Arnold. Beltower — You will receive your reward, Arnold, for this hour’s work, and quickly. The war may be over and the law may be able to do little to you for your treachery but I shall find you. (Starts to go, returns.) If the people of Richmond knew you were here no power this side of heaven could save you. They would gather and hang you from the nearest tree. (Again starts, returns.) By heaven they shall know, I will point you out, and they will tear you limb from limb. Turns hurriedly to exit. Washington — (Sharply) Tiler, guard well the door! Beltower, approach. Beltower hesitates, then does so You are still a Mason in name, Beltower, whatever you may be when Sir Francis has had opportunity to inform your breth - ren of your conduct. Colonel Crisp, your sword. Colonel Crisp extends his sword — hilt forward — to Washing- ion. Takes it from Washington after the vow of secrecy. Before you go — the vow of secrecy! Beltower — (Hesitates. Then, sullenly places hand on the hilt of the sword:) I vow. Washington — And you will bear in mind that the penalties of your vows are very real and very sure. I have given my word that this man (points to Arnold) shall reach his vessel unhurt. Masons everywhere will see to it that the word of Washington shall not be set at naught. Begone! Beltower leaves with an air of bravado Tiler assures himself of his departure and returns to the room.

The tempter, it is true, is to be condemned, but not less the weak and sinful man who welcomes the temptation. And Treason is a crime over which Masonry casts no mantle of Char - ity. • Arnold — But hear me, General and men — formerly my brothers. I must speak the truth. I am overcome with shame and remorse. I am heartbroken and disconsolate. I languish in a foreign land, among people who are not my people. I yearn for home. More than ever, since landing upon these shores, I am wishful never again to leave them. Be kind! Be generous! Let me come again to my own country. Washington — (Rising) You have no country. You had one, a fait land where you were born and honorably reared. You had a flag, you had friends, and fellow-patriots, and brother Masons. All these you chose to lose — to wreck that had been given you on the rocks of desperate an*Aii~bition. You yourself have done what has been done, and this is the price you pay — that you are a man without a country. The soil of England is not yours. The soil of America spurns your feet. You will live, perhaps, for many years, for you are still in the earliest reaches of middle age, and through all those years you will pay the price. You may serve beneath the Cross of St. George, but it is not your flag. Across some rampart, or flying beyond a stretch of sunlit sea, your eyes may fall upon the Stars and Stripes of America — and that is not your flag. No home. No country. No emblem to honor or revere, toward which you can look with devoted eyes and cry: “The banner of my Nation!” Your feet are fated to tread a dreary path until they lead you to the grave; and through all your journey your name will be hissing and a byword, for in all the lands beneath the sun there is no place where honest men do not despise a traitor. Your name will be forgotten by Masons, or if not for- 4 ‘I gotten, will be remembered only to be execrated. It is a great, a terrible price — bui it is not too much. Brethren, do you ap- prove my words? All raise right hands. Arnold stands bowed, overwhelmed I have kept my pledge to you. I have given you safe conduct here, and you will be returned safely to your ship. You shall never again visit the land which you endeavored to betray. We shall never look upon your face again! Arnold moves slowly toward the door — a broken man He pauses, looks back as if to renew his plea Near the door, stops, offers his hand to the nearest General who folds his arms and turns his back Arnold goes out in silence, followed by Colonel Crisp who is to escort him back to his ship As the door closes, Washington speaks — Washington — (Sadly) How great was that man’s opportun - ity for service! How tragic was his fall from honor! How bitter, and yet how just, is his humiliation and remorse. Let me say again what must never be forgotten: Treason is a crime over which Masonry casts no mantle of Charity!
