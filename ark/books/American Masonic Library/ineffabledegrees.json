DISCOURSE BY THE GRAND ORATOR My brethren, it is my intention, at this time, to give you a clearer account than you have yet been acquainted with of Masonry, of which at present you barely know the elements. In doing this, it will be necessary to explain to you some circumstances of very remote antiquity. Enoch, son of Jared, was the sixth son in descent from Adam, and lived in the fear and love of his Maker. Enoch, being iiispired by the Most High, and in com• memoration of a wonderful vision, built a temple under - ground, and dedicated the same to God. Methusaleh, the son of Enoch, constructed the building, without being acquainted with his father’s motives. This hap - pened in that part of the world which was afterward called Canaan, and since known by the name of the Holy Land. Enoch caused a Triangular Plate of gold to be made, which was a cubit long on each side. He enriched ii with precious stones, and encrusted the plate upon a cubic stone of Agate. He then engraved upon it THE INEFFABLE CHARACTERS, and placed it upon a tri - angular peddle of white marble, which he deposited in the deepest Arch. When Enoch’s temple was completed, he made a door of stone, and put a ring of iron therein by which it might be occasionally raised, and placed it over the opening of the Arch, that the matters enclosed therein niighr be preserved from the universal destruction im - pending. None but Enoch knew of the treasure which the arches contained. — 35 —"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Solomon began to build in the fourth yeai of his ieign, agreeable to a plan given to him by David his father upon the Ark of Alliance, a Temple to the Living God. The number of the Grand and Sublime Elected was at first Three, and now consisted of Five and continued so until the Temple was completed and dedicated Then King Solomon, as a reward for their faithful services, admitted to this degree the twelve Grand Masters who had faithfully presided over the twelve tribes.
