PENDLETON, 33* Sovereign Grand Commander, Southern Jurisdiction These ceremonies are public; they must take place at mid - night, and may be held in a church or in the hail of the Order or at the residence of the decease’d. The walls should be covered with black cloth, and on a trest]e in the center of the room will, be placed the coffin con - taining the body of the deceased Knight. The body should be dressed in the habit of the I(adosh, the legs crossed, and the arms folded on the breast. On the upper end of the coffin-lid must be a wreath of white roses, and below it the insignia of the Order, and tne sword of the deceased Knight in its scabbard. At the head of the coffin ~1s to stand an iron cross, painted black, and the Grand Commander of the Kadosh is to bear an iron hammer, painted black. The officers preceding, the Knights, each bearing a taper and wearing a white rose upon his breast, will enter the cham - ber, one by one, and as silently as shadows. The Knights so entering will arrange themselves in a semi~circle on the East, West and South sides of the coffin, and the Grand Commander will stand at the head of the coffin and behind the iron cross. After standing a few moments in perfect silence, the Grand Commander will say: Grand Commander—Dear Brethren and Knights of the Holy House o~ the Temple, it has pleased our Father who is in Heaven to take away from among us the living soul of our Brother Illustrious P R and to leave, unto his body, of which we are about to dispose accordino’ to our ancient Knightly custom; but we are first of 1~ il to hold a judgment on ~he Knight whose mortal remains lie before us. It is midnight’s holy hour and silence no’w is brood - iiig like a gentle spirit over the still and pulseless ‘world. Our Br~ther has finished his earthly proba - r ; P:’ 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"tion. Let us look back upon his life, and see how he has stobd the test. If any ‘of you, or any, one else who hears me, can accuse of wrong this Knight now, dead, let him stand forth and so declare. First Lieutenant advances at the head of the coffin, lays his right hapd upon it and says: First Lieutenant—Venerable Grand Commander,’ I crave permission to speak. Commander inclines his head in assent,’ and first Lieutenant says: First Lieutenant—Grand Master and Brethren, it belongs not unto man, but unto God, to judge the dead. He alone can with )ustice reward and punish. He alone can look into the soul, and know its most s’ecret motives, and at once’ see and know all that, from birth until death, a man ha~h thought and said and done. Therefore, Grand Commander, if thou wert even thrice to call upon us to accuse our Brot~her, whose, lips are closed so that he can no longer answer for himself, thou would’st call in vain, for we are all Brethren in the bonds of Knighthood, and do revel - ence our dead. Commander—It is my bounden duty again to ask you, Brethren. We are, free members of the Order of the Holy House of the Temple of Solomon. Speak if ye have aught whereof to accuse the Brbthe,r whose body lieth here awaiting burial. Grand Commander will pause for some moments, during which there will be deathlike silence. Then in a loud voice: Comma=nder—Since there is no accuser, there, can be no judgment. Does no man accuse the dead? (All Knights kneel on the right knee, and answer:) All :—God is his judge and ours. (Commnnaer raises his hammer, and strikes three heavy blows upon the iron cross, and then says:) 6 “‘P Commander—Let the, grav~~ then be ready to re; ceive this ‘i~bdy~ Brethren, hear and make answer! When will God judge the dead? First Liez~tenant—In his own good time. Commander-Who will be the man’s accuser? Second Lieutenant—His conscience. Commander-His defender? First Lieutenant—INo One. ‘Second Lieutenant—No One. C!ommander—Wh o will give testimony against him? Commander-No one. First Lieutenant—God, ~ho will judge, knoweth all. Commander-Who, then, shall go uncondemned? Second Lieutenant—The mercy of God is infinite, as his justice is, and He hath pity for the creatures that He hath made’ imperfect, frail and faulty. Commander-The Almighty God is merciful as well as just. The,refore, my Brethren, let us obey His laws. Prepare the body of our Brother for its last resting- place. • Commander strikes three blows again’ on the Iron cross. Knights will arise. Grand Chancellor and Architect remove the coffin- lid, and expose to view the body of the deceased Knight. The hands and feet will be found tied with cord, the temples adorned with a wreath of laurel and vine leaves, and on the heart will ]ie a bunch of fresh - ly culled roses. On the breast a cross of gold. Commander-Knights, serving in your respective stations, give heed to my commands, and make answe~r to my questions. What means the wreath of leaves of • laurel and vine?’ First Lieutenant—That man lives for honor and en - joyment. Com~nander-There are better things than these to live for in this world, and better things await the good and wise in ‘a better life. The laurel and vine deca~y and perish; honors fade like leave~; and enjoyment bears little fruit except regrets. Relieve the dead of such vain distinctions."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(Grand Gharrcellor takes the wreath from the’ tem - ples of the deceased.) Com~mander-What means the sparkling cross?

Commander-As we brought nothing into the world with us, it is certain that we ciin take nothing’out. We leave behind us all the glories of our earthly ‘stat% and lay down all our dignities, when we fall into the <~ grave. Take from the dead the, glittering bauble for which he no longer cares. First Lieutenant takes the cross from the breast of the deceased. Commander—Why are his hands and feet bound with cords. Second Lieutenant—To show that in this life man is the, slave of his habits and the bondman of circum - stances. Commander-Death has ended that bondage, and freed our Brother from that servitude. Remove the bonds. (Second Lieutenant takes off the cords.) Commander-What me~in the roses on his breast? Second Lieutenant—They are symbols of purity and affection; the offering of brotherly love to one who deserves to be, remembered, and whose death should make us sad and sorrowful. Commander-Dd ye know of a truth that our Broth - er in the coffin is dead, and does not merely sleep? Second Lieutenant—(Taleing the hand oA the dead): The flesh cleaveth not unto the bone$, nor to the skin unto the flesh. Verily our Brother is dead. Commander—How looke,th his grave?

May the grace of our Father who is in Heaven make our Brother to see the truth more clearly in the new life. First Lieutenant—This cheek will no more feel the pressure of the lips of love, no~ blush with shame, nor be red with anger. It is cold and white and lifeless as the marble. May our Fathe,r who is in Heaven be gracious unto our Brother, and give to him a spiritual body, warm with the rosy hues of eternal life. Second Lieutenant—This mouth will speak no’ more to anyone in this world. What it hath said of good, may our Father who is in Heaven make to bear good fruit. What of ill, may he make to work no harm and be forgotten. Firdt Lieutez~ant—This heart no longer beats. It has ~onnted all the moments of our Brother’s life, and stopped forever. No feeling or affection is its tenant now. May our Father who is in He,aven forgive the weaknesses and reward the generous loving kindness of our Brother.

GRAND ORATOR READS FOLLOWING PSALM: Man, that is born of a woman, has but a short time to live, and Is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay. In the midst of life we are in death, of whom may we seek for succour, but of Thee, 0 Lord, who for our sins are justly displeased? Yet, 0 Lord God most holy, 0 Lord most mighty, 0 holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not Into the bitter pains of eternal death. Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts, shut not Tb~ merciful ears to our prayer but spare us, Lord most holy, 0 God most mighty, 0 holy and merciful Saviour, Thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from Thee.

(Knights arise) The coffin is then closed by the Grand Chancellor ,and Grand Architect when the GrancvCommander says: Grand Commander—Retire in peace, my Brethren, and emulate, the good example of him whose lifeless remains now lie before us. The Knights, led by the Grand Commander, will kiss their right hand three times toward the coffin, saying, each time: Farewell! Farewell! Farewell! The End.

Now each taper, exce,pt that of the Grand Com - mander, is extinguished, and all the Knights, kneeling ~vith their arms crossed, pray silently. Then the Grand Commander strikes the iron cross three times with the iron hammer, and in a de,ep and solemn voice says: Commander—i bless thee, 0 dead Brother, in the name of Almighty God, in the name of the Order of the Holy house of the, Temple, and in the name oj the Knights and Brethren here assembled.

ADDRESS From time immemorial, man has plighted his’ faith and confidence in his fellow man by drinking from the same cup and eating from the same loaf. Among Eastern nations at the present day this method of solemnizing a pledge has been retained. We learn from history, a~nd our fathers of the Masonic faith, that in the ancient mysteries of Judea and Egypt, the newly initiated were presented with bread and wine as a symbol of the new life, they were about entering upon, and that they were henceforth to be devoted to the laws of truth, and knowledge, of their rights and duties. This feast, and th~ bread and wine of which we par - take, are to us symbols of fraternity and brotherly affection, and of that perfeet union that must ever subsist among Brother Knights of the jtose Croix. Titus, Brother Knights, are we assembled, solemnly and fraternally pledging ourselves one to another in brotherly love, in the preseAce of the angejls and of that great Intelligence that sur~ounds us in our every action. MOsil Wise breaks the bread, takes a piece and eats, and, passing the plate, says: Take, and eat, and give to the, hungry. Music, soft.
