As the purity of our Ritual depends in a very great degree upon tl~ie accura~cy and fidelity with which the officers perform their various duties, it may not be amiss to inform those officers, in the first place, of the stations they are expected to occupy in conferring the several degrees, when they are elected officers of a Chapter, and then to remind them that each is expected to possess, or immediately acquire, an intimate and perfect knowledge of the part he is called on to perform in the Ritual of each degree: The officers rank thus: R.

CHARGE AT OPENING A LODGE OF MARK MASTERS. “Wherefore, brethren, lay aside all malice, and guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings. If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To Whom coming, as unto a living stone,- disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also as living stones be ye built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up sacrifices acceptable to God.

As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God~ Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God.” SECTION I. The first section explains the manner of open - ing a Mark Master’s Lodge, and recapitulates the mystic ceremony of the preparatory circumstances of introducing a candidate. The number of artists employed in building the Temple are enumerated, and the progress they made in architecture is speci - fied; and it ends with a beautiful display of the manner in which one of the principal events origi - nated which characterizes this degree. SECTION II. In the second section is recited the mode of ad - vancing a candidate to this degree. Herein, the Mark Master is instructed in the origin and his - tory of this degree and the indispensable obliga - tion he is under to stretch forth his assisting hand to the relief of an indigent and worthy brother to a certain and specified extent. We are here taught to ascribe praise to the meritorious and dispense rewards to the diligent and industrious. During the ceremonies, the following passages of Scripture are read: Ezekiel xliv: 1, 2, 3, 5. “Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the East; and it was shut. Then said the Lord unto me, This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall en - ter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, bath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same. And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with Len en [js 4, F"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"/ 10 M.ARK MASTER’S DEGREE. thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanc - tuary. The use of the mark is here exemplified: The ancient city Joppa, where many of the ma - terials for King Solomon’s Temple were landed, and Masonic tradition informs us that the sea - coast at that place was so nearly perpendicular that it was with difficulty the workmen could asdend without assistance, which was afforded them from above by guards placed there with this strong grip. * * * * * * Son of man * ** *** The following texts of Scripture are introduced and explained: “This is the stone which was set at naught by you builders which is become the head of the corner. “The stone which the builders rejected is be - come the head stone of the corner.* I VIRGINIA TEXT-BOOK 11 “Did ye never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner “And have ye not read this Scripture, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner?” * * * “What is this, then, which is written, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner?” * * * * Here follows a full explanation of the Degree. * * * * * * * “To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden manna; and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving him that receiv - eth it.” * * * * * * The working tools of a Mark Master are the Chisel and Mallet.

The Mallet teaches to correct irregularities and to reduce man to a proper level, so that by quiet deportment he may, in the school of discipline, learn to be content. What the mallet is to the work. man, *nlightened reason is to the passions; it curbs ambition, it depresses envy, it moderates anger, and it encourages good dispositions; whence arises among all good Masons that comely order, “Which nothing earthly gives, or can destroy, The soul’s calm sunshine, and the heartfelt joy. The following song is sung, accompanied with appropriate ceremonies: Marl< Masters all appear Before the Chief O’erseer; In concert move; Let him your work inspect For the Chief Architect; If there is no defect, He will approve.

[FoLLow ME] Now to the Westward move, Where, lull of Strength and Love, Hiram doth stand; But if imposters are Mixed with the worthy there, Caution them to beware Of the right hand. Previous to completing the ceremonies, the fol - lowing Parable is recited: “For the kindom of Heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market-place, and said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. Again len en ‘is 4, h"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"14 VIRGINIA TEXT-BOOK. MARK MASTER’S DEGREE he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them. Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say ti~nto him, Because no man bath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. So when ‘~even was come, the Lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise re - ceived every man a penny. And when they had re - ceived it, they murmured against the good man of the house, saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good? So the last 15 shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.” Now to the praise of those Who triumphed o’er the foes Of Mason’s Art, To the praiseworthy three, Who founded this degree, May all their virtues be Deep in our hearts. CHARGE TO BE DELIVERED TO A CANDIDATE WHO Is ADVANCED TO THE HONORARY DEGREE OF MARK MASTER. Brother A. B., I congratulate you on having been thought worthy of being advanced to this honorable degree of Masonry. Permit me to im - press it on your mind, that your assiduity should ever be commensurate with your duties, which be - come more and more extensive as you advance in Masonry. In the honorable character of Mark Master Ma - son, it is more particularly your duty to endeavor to let your conduct in the Lodge, and among your brethren, be such as may stand the test of the Grand Overseer’s Square, that you may not, like len en ‘is"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"While such is your conduct, should misfortune assail you, should friends forsake you, should envy traduce your good name, and malice persecute you, yet may you have Confidence that among Mark Mas’ter Masons you will find friends, who will ad - minister relief to your distresses, and comfort your afflictions—ever bearing in mind, as a consolation under all the frowns of fortune, and as an en - couragement to hope for better prospects, that the stone which the builders rejected, possessing merits to them unknown, became the chief stone of the corner. It treats of the government of a Lodge, the dis - position of its rulers, and illustrates their requisite qualifications. By order of the Grand Lodge of Virginia, it is made the duty of every Warden of a Lodge, upon his election to office, and previous to entering upon its duties, to qualify himself for occasional discharge of the duties of the Chair by receiving the degree of Past Master as it was given previous to the year 1797, up to which time all the degrees of Masonry were given under the authority of a Master’s Warrant or Charter. len en ‘is 16 MARK MASTERS DEGREE. the unfinished and imperfect work of the negli - gent and unfaithful of former times, be rejected and thrown aside, a.s unfit for “that spiritual build - ing, that house not t~ade with hands, eternal in the heavens.” This is purely an honorary degree, and its cere - monies, when properly conducted, impress the can - didate very seriously and teach a lesson of diffidence in assuming the responsibilities of an office with - out due preparation for the performance of its duties. “But,” says Mackey, in his excellent Lexicon, “the degree is also conferred in Royal Arch Chap - ters, where it succeeds the Mark Miaster’s degree."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"/ 18 PAST MASTER’S DEGREE. The conferring of this degree, which has no histori - cal connection with the rest of the degrees in a Chapter, arises from the following circumstances: Originally, when Chapters of Royal Arch Masons were ‘under the goVernment ‘of Lodges, in which the degree was then always conferred, it was a part of the regulations that no one should receive the Royal Arch degree unless he had previously presided in the Lodge as Master. When the Chap - ters became independent, the regulation could not be abolished, for that would have been an innova - tion. The difficulty has, therefore, been obviated by making every candidate for the degree of Royal Arch a Past Master before his exaltation.” Previous to Investiture, the candidate is re - quired to give his unqualified assent to the follow - ing charges: 1. You agree to be a good man and true, and strictly to obey the moral law. 2. You agree to be a peaceable citizen, and cheerfully to conform to the laws of the country in which you may reside. v~ RGINIA TEXT-BOOK 19 3. You promise not to be concerned in plots and conspiracies against Government, but patient - ly to subniit to the decisions of the Supreme Legis - lature. 4.

You agree to hold in veneration the original rulers and patrons of the Order of Masonry, and their regular successors, supreme and subordinate, according to their stations, and to submit to the awards of your brethren, when convened, in every case consistent with the constitutions of the Order. 6. You agree to avoid private piques and quar - rels, and to guard against intemperance and excess. 7. You agree to be cautious in carriage and behavior, courteous to your brethren, and faithful to your Lodge. 8. You promise to respect genuine brethren, and to discountenance imposters and all dissenters from the original plan of Masonry. len en ‘is"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PA5T MASTER’S DEGREE. 20 VIRGENIA TEXT-BOOK. 9.

You promise to pay homage to the Grand Master for the time being and to his officers when duly installed, and strictly to conform to every edict of the Grand Lodge or General Assembly of Ma - sons that is not subversive of the principles and ground-work of ~v1asonry. 11. You admit that it is not in the power of any man, or body of men, to make innovations in the body of Masonry. 12. You admit that no new Lodge shall be formed without permission from the Grand Lodge, and that no countenance be given to any irregular Lodge, or to any person clandestinely initiated therein, being contrary to the ancient charges of the Order. 13.

I now invest you with the badge of your office, the Square, which will silently admonish you to do justice to the cause of Masonry; give due com - mendation to the worthy members of the Orders and rebuke those who act contrary to its laws. The Holy Writings, that great light in Ma - sonry, will guide you to all truth; it will direct your path to the temple of happiness, and point out to you the whole duty of man. The Square teaches to regulate our actions by rule and line, and to harmonize our conduct by the principles of morality and virtue.

(See Proceedings of the G. Chapter of Mary - land, pages 16 and 17, of the year 1824.) In the spread of Masonry over our happy coun - try, this degree has been everywhere hailed with enthusiasm and warmly adopted. It rationally ac - counts for the necessary concealment and preserva - tion of those essentials of the Craft which were len en Ljs"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1 SELECT MASTER’S DEGREE. 24 brought to light at the rebuilding of the second Temple, and which lay concealed from the Masonic eye for the space of four hundred and seventy years; and displays~~in an en~inent degree the con - summate prudence, wisdom, and foresight of our illustrious patrons in Masonry. Many particulars, relative to those few who were selected for their skill, virtue, and inflexible fideL - ity, to complete an important part of King Solo - mon’s Temple, are explained; and here, too, is exemplified an instance of Justice and Mercy by an ancient patron towards one of the Craft who was led to disobey his commands by an over zealous attachment for the institution. It ends with a de - scription of a particular circumstance which char - acterizes the degree. The following Psalm is read at opening the Council, as all meetings of Select Masters are called: Psalm lxxxvii. “His foundation is in the holy mountains. The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken vIRG] NIA TEi~T-BOOK. of thee, 0 city of God. Selah.

As well the singers as the play - ers on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.” The following passages of Scripture are ex - plained: I Kings, iv: 1, 5 and 6. “So King Solomon was King over all Israel, Azariah, the son of Nathan, was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal offi - cer, and the King’s friend: and Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.” I Kings, v:17, 18. “And the King commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

Let uprightness and integrity attend your steps; let Justice and Mercy mark your conduct; let fervency and zeal stimulate you in the discharge of the various duties incumbent on you; but suffer not an idle or impertinent curi - osity to lead you astray, or betray you into danger. Be deaf to every insinuation which would have a tendency to weaken your resolution, or tempt you to an act of disobedience; be voluntarily dumb and blind, when the exercise of those faculties would endanger the peace of your mind, or the probity of your conduct; and let silence and secrecy, those cardinal virtues of a Select Master, on all neces - sary occasions, be scrupulously observed.

It enables us with ease and facility to examine the privileges of others to this degree, while, at the same time, it proves ourselves. It is based upon the following passages of Scrip - ture: I Kings, vii: 48-50. “And Solomon made all the vessels that per - tained unto the house of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shew - bread was, and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold, and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the tem - ple. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work, that he had made King Solomon, for the house of the Lord. Revelation, xxii: 12-14. “And behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, the be - ginning and the end, the first and the last. Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree oF life, and may enter in through the gates into the City.” READ. I Kings, vi: 27. “And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. The Ark, called the glory oE Israel, which was seated in the midst of the holy place, under the wings of the cherubims, was a small chest, or coffer, three len en ‘is"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"30 ROYAL MASTER’S DEGREE. feet nine inches long, two Feet three inches wide, and three feet three inches high. It was made of wood, excepting only the mercy seat, but overlaid with pure gold both inside and out. It had a ledge of gold surrot~nding it at the top, into which the cover, called the mercy seat, was let in. The mercy seat was of pure gold, the thickness of an hand’s breadth; at the two ends of it were two cherubims, looking inwards toward each other, with their wings expanded, which, embracing the whole circumference of the mercy seat, they met on each side in the middle; all of which the Rabbins say was made out of the same mass, without any sol - dering of parts. Here the Shekinab, or Divine Presence, rested, and was visible in the appearance of a cloud over it. From hence the Bathkoll issued, and gave answers when God was consulted. And hence it is that God is said in the Scriptures to dwell between the cherubims, that is, between the chern - bims on the mercy seat, because there was the seat or throne of the visible appearance of His glory among them. 9tITh~t (~xceIIent 41a~ter’~ Degree None but the meritorious and praiseworthy, none but those who by diligence and industry have progressed far toward perfection, none but those who have been seated in the Oriental chair by the unanimous suff rages of their brethren, can be ad - mitted to this degree of Masonry. In its original establishment, when the temple at Jerusalem was finished, and the fraternity cele - brated the capstone with great joy, it is demonstra - ble that none but those who had proved themselves complete masters of their profession were admitted to this honor; and, indeed, the duties incumbent on every Mason who is accepted and acknowledged as a Most Excellent Master, are such as render it indispensable that he should have a perfect knowl - edge of all the preceding degrees.

Now, when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from Heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices: and the gloty of the Lord filled the house. And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord’s house. And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good; For his mercy endureth forever.” * * * * BROTHER: CHARGE.

Hutchinson, in his excellent treatise on Mason - ry, says: “As Moses was commanded to pull his shoes from off his feet on Mount Horeb, because the ground whereon he trod was sanctified by the presence of the Divinity, so the Mason who would prepare himself for this exalted stage of Masonry should advance in the naked paths of truth, be divested of every degree of arrogance, and ap - proach with steps of innocence, humility, and vir - tue to challenge the ensigns of an Order whose institutions arise on the most solemn and sacred principles of religion.” And Lawrence Dermott, in his edition of Ahiman Rezon, says: “This de - len en Us I"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"40 ROYAL ARCH DEGREE.

This section explains the mode of government in this degree; it designates the appellation, num - ber, and situation of the several officers, and points out the purpose and duty of their respective sta - tions. The various colors of their banners are designated and the morals to which they allude are introduced and explained. The following passage of Scripture is read at opening: “Now, we command you, brethren, that ye with - draw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he re - ceived of us. For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us, for we behaved ourselves not dis - orderly among you. Neither did we eat any man s bread for nought, but wrought with labor and tra - vail day and night that we might not be chargeable to any of you. Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us; for even when we were with you this we com - manded you, that if any would not work, neither • should he eat; for we hear that there are some who walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busy-bodies. Now, them that are such, we com - mand and exhort that with quietness they work and eat their own bread. But ye, brethren, be ye not weary in well doing. And if any man obey not our word, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. Now, tl~e Lord of peace himself give you peace always.” SECTION II.

Exodus iii: 1:6. “Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father- in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am]. And He said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

We will soon leave the Euphrates and go out upon the desert. That country on the opposite side of the river is Messo - potamia, where our father Abraham once dwelt. We are now entering upon the desert. The first place we will come to will be the ruins of Tadmab, the city of Palm Trees, built by our King, the wise and mighty Solomon, about fifteen years aFter the completion of the Temple. It was destroyed by the Chaldeans before they besieged Jerusalem. We are now among the ruins of Tadmab. What mag - nificence! Aye, what desolation! Stupendous rows of columns and obelisks, all of the most ex - quisite workmanship, lie scattered among the sand. Let us see if we can make our way through these ruins. * * Second Rough Road. Solomon built Tadmab in the Wilderness, as a place of rest and protection to the caravans, and provided them safe escolts to Jerusalem, thence to Tyre, where the ships of Tarsus received their rich merchandise and conveyed it to all the known parts of the world.

We will leave Damascus, cross the river Jordan, and pass the old quarries of Zeradatha, where the marble was prepared for the Temple. Our pathway lies di - rectly through these quarries and is rough and rugged, and we will have trouble in crossing some of these old dilapidated bridges, which from their architectural, beauty, once added to the rich natu - ral scenery.

You have once more entered the Most Holy Place, and been informed in what manner the Omnific Word was preserved through centuries of moral darkness by the wise suggestion of the Widow’s Son.

And you have now witnessed the mournful desolation of Zion—the sack and de - struction of the City and Temple of our God, and the utter loss, as the world supposed, of those sacred articles contained in the Holy of Holies. You have seen the chosen people of God forced by a foreign despot from the pleasant groves and peaceful vineyards of their native Israel, and dragged into captivity on the banks of the far-off Euphrates.

And now, my Companions, if in all these things you have seen only a series of unmeaning rites— if the spirit of Truth has not applied the moral of these ceremonies to your hearts, then indeed have we “labored in vain,” and you “have spent your strength for naught.” But I am persuaded to believe better things of you.

No one can reflect on the ceremonies of gain - mg admission into this place without being forci - bly struck with the important lessons which they teach.
