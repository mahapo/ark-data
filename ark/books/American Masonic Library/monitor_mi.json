The invaluable work titled “Illustrations of Masonry” was started in 1770 and it was so popular that in less than forty years ten editions were needed to satisfy the demand. Today a first edition of the work is worth at least $ [0,000. Preston was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1742, and most of his life was spent as a corrector of copy and Editor of the London (England) Chronicle. America’s first Masonic Monitor made its debut September 26, 1797, under the authorship of Thomas Smith Webb, Past Grand Master of Rhode island, and was revised during the next thirty years more than a score of times. It was, of course, very largely a copy of Preston’s “Illustrations,” properly adapted to the work of the American Craft. Webb in his Preface said: “The observations upon the first three degrees are many of them taken from Preston’s ‘Illustrations of Masonry’ with some necessary alterations. With the formation of the Grand Lodge of Michigan in 1826 we find the constituent lodges using almost every available Monitor. Thus we find in vogue Preston, Webb in almost all editions, James Hardie, Benjamin Gleason, and the written instructions of Jeremy Cross and John Barney. I. F"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"It was John Barney who placed the Masonic work in Mkhigan on a firm footing. He had served as Grand Lecturer of Ohio from 1836 to 1843, and following two years (1844-45) of intensive Masonic lecriring in Michigan he was named Grand Lecturer of illinois. Barney received his Masonic schooling directly from Thomas Smith Webb and it was the well- taught lessons of Webb that Barney passed on to the struggling Craft in Michigan, and his instruction was so thorough that it served Michigan for some fifty years. In 1875 the Webb-Fenton Monitor was authorized by Grand Lodge. James Fenton was Grand Secretary from 1848 to 1873 and it was during this period that he began to adapt and revise the Webb and Barney systems to properly cater to the Masonic needs of Michigan. Near the close of the 19th Century, Michigan Masons decided that a Michigan Monitor was highly essential. In 1895 a committee was appointed to revise the Monitor and in 1897 it was adopted and the work became known as the Michigan Masonic Monitor. It was reprinted in 1908 and 1911. Under the direction of George L. Lusk, Past Grand Master, and Frank 0. Gilbert, Grand Lecturer, it was copyrighted, and was reprinted with some changes in 1937, 1939, 1941, 1944, and 1956. In 1970 the Michigan Masonic Monitor was completely revised by a Committee consisting of Robert A. Hockstad, P.G.M., Charles Solmo, U D G.M., and J. Fairbairn Smith, P.M. Some additions were made and considerable obsolete material was deleted. In 1979 the Board of Directors of the Grand Lodge, acting on reports that the Constituent Lodges were asking for a more compact book, assigned to the Publications Committee the task of removing certain sections and rearranging the remaining ones in a more logical order. The 1979 edition is the result of that assignment. We hope you will find it useful. In 1986 the Chapel Committal Service and the Chapel Candlelight Service which were already in use were revised and added to the Monitor. F r F Newton S. Bacon, P.G.M. Charles P. Sheffield, P.M.

It is an act of great discourtesy to a visiting officer to omit his formal reception by the Lodge. In an official visitation the visiting officer should require it. On the occasion of visits, not official, it will be found greatly to increase a true fraternal feeling when the courtesy is properly done. VISITING MASON When a brother visits a Lodge and has been examined or vouched for, the Master will instruct the Senior Deacon to introduce him. That officer conducts him to the west of the altar and giving the proper penal sign of the degree in which the Lodge is opened, addresses the Worshipful Master: Worshipful Master, I have the pleasure of present - ing to you brother _____________ of _____________ LodgeNo. __________ of ,Stateof The Worshipful Master calls up the Lodge, addresses the Senior Warden: Brother Senior Warden Worshipful 1 14"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Master: — How should Masons meet? On the level. (All officers and brethren move to level) (W.M.) Brother ______________ gives me pleasure to welcome you and to introduce you to the members of Lodge. We meet on __________ and shall be most happy to welcome you to any of our meetings. The Senior Deacon then conducts the brother to a seat and the Worshipful Master seats the Lodge. No brother should be allowed to visit a Lodge for the first time without an introduction. If the visitor is a Past Master, or Worshipful Master he should be invited to a seat in the east. The Master should take great care to extend the proper courtesies to visiting brothers and to make them feel that they are welcome. GRAND LODGE When a visit from the Grand Lodge is expected, the Worshipful Master will see that a convenient apartment is provided for the use of the Grand Lodge, in order that it may be opened in proper form. On being notified that the Grand Lodge is opened and prepared for the visitation, the Worshipful Master, having previously opened his Lodge on the Master Mason degree, will send a committee, headed by one or more Past Masters, the Deacons and Stewards (with their rods) and the [ Marshal to escort the Grand Lodge into the Lodge room. A procession is formed in the following order, in the anteroom just outside the outer door: — (double file) Marshal Steward Steward Past Master Past Master Senior Deacon Junior Deacon Grand Marshal Grand Tiler Sr. Grand Deacon Jr. Grand Deacon Grand Lecturer Grand Chaplain Grand Treasurer Grand Secretary Sr. Grand Warden Jr. Grand Warden Deputy Grand Master Grand Master On arriving at the open outer door, the Marshal will announce: The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free & Accepted Masons of the State of Michigan The Worshipful Master calls up his Lodge and removes his hat. The procession enters. (Suitable marching music is desirable.) The Stewards halt inside the door and cross their rods, over the door. 2 3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Marshal leads the procession toward the east, until he clears the Senior Warden’s station, turns left to a point immediately in front of the Senior Warden, turns right and proceeds east to a point approximately six feet back of the west side of the altar. The Marshal turns left and proceeds to the north side of the Lodge room, and faces east. The procession turns right and left as they reach the designated spot six feet back of the altar and form a line across the Lodge room with the Marshal at the extreme north end of the line, one of the Past Masters at the extreme south end of the line, the Most Worshipful Grand Master in the center immediately back of the altar with the Deputy Grand Master on his left. (The line thus formed from north to south is as follows): The Marshal; a Past Master; the Senior Deacon; the Grand Marshal, the Senior Grand Deacon; the Grand Lecturer; the Grand Treasurer; the Senior Grand Warden; the Deputy Grand Master; the Most Worshipful Grand Master; the Junior Grand Warden; the Grand Secretary; the Grand Chaplain; the Junior Grand Deacon; the Grand Tiler; the Junior Deacon; a Past Master. After the procession has passed through the outer door the two Stewards who have crossed their rods over the door, fall in at the end of the procession and come to a halt one pace back of the Grand Master and Deputy Grand Master at the altar. When the line is fully formed the Marshal says; “Brethren, the Flag.” The salute to the Flag is given in unison; followed by the penal f I: r sign of the M. M. degree; or in case of an open meeting, by placing the right hand over the heart with a slight bow. The Senior Deacon then introduces the Most Worshipful Grand Master to the Worshipful Master as follows: “Worshipful Master: — I have the honor to present to you, and through you to the officers, members, visitors (and guests) of__________________ Lodge No. __________ , Free and Accepted Masons, Most Worshipful Brother , Grand Master of Masons of the State of Michigan and his suite.’’ The Worshipful Master will come down to the altar and greet the Grand Master and escort him to the east. The Grand Honors are then given and the gavel presented to the Grand Master. He in turn introduces each of the members of his Grand Lodge line, the introductions being acknowledged by placing the right [iand over the heart with a slight bow. The Grand Master will then instruct that they proceed under escort either to a seat in the east or to their respective stations and places. The Marshal will then give the command; “Column left, march.” The procession will move clockwise under the leadership of the Marshal and Senior Deacon until all are ~seated. The Stewards who are standing immediately back of the line will turn right after the line has passed and immediately return to their places. As each Grand Lodge officer 4 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"reaches his respective station or place, the corre - sponding officer of the host Lodge greets him and vacates his station or place to him. The Grand Master, at his pleasure resigns the gavel and chair to the Worshipful Master; where - upon the other Grand Lodge officers resign their respective stations or places to the proper officers of the Lodge, repair to the east and take seats on the right and left of the M.W.G.M. When the Grand Master expresses his desire to retire; having previously resigned the chair and gavel to the Worshipful Master, the Lodge is called up; Grand Honors are given. Then the Grand Master gives the order: — “Worshipful Grand Marshal; form the Grand Lodge in procession.” The Grand Marshal gives the command; — “Brethren of Grand Lodge: — Form the procession.” Soft. march - ing mLlsic should be played while the Grand Marshal moves slowly to the west to give all Grand Lodge Officers an opportunity to fall in. (The Stewards go to the outer door and cross their rods.) The procession moves to the west, across in front of the Senior Warden to the north side of the Lodge room, up the north side to a point about one pace west of the altar. Across behind the altar, halt and turn east; salute the flag in unison, and acknowledge the East by placing the right hand over the heart with a slight bow, and resume march out of outer door. 6 fi~ I: GRAND MASTER (OR HIS PROXY) When a visit from the Grand Master is expected, the same preparations should be made as in the case of the reception of the Grand Lodge. A procession is formed in like manner, with the addition that one of the oldest members; (a Past Master if possible) should appear in the procession bearing the Book of Constitutions. He should follow immediately behind the Past Masters. With this exception, the procession is formed in the same order and proceeds in the same manner. Introductions and all other details are exactly parallel. When the Grand Master expresses a desire to retire, the Past Master and Deacons should approach the east as he is ready to leave and form an escort for him to the altar and to the outer door; the Stewards having formed the arch with their crossed rods. A visitor carrying the Grand Master’s written proxy (either in the form of a letter or a dispensa - tion) is the personal representative of the Grand Master and should be treated exactly as the Grand Master himself would be if he were present. This includes affording him public or private Grand Honors depending upon the occasion. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS It is the prerogative, as well as the duty, of every retiring Worshipful Master to install his successor. He may, however, delegate this duty to some other well-informed Past Master. When the Grand Master or his representative is present to conduct the installation, he should be received with appropriate honors. The retiring Worshipful Master should arrange, with the pleasure of the Installing Officer, for persons to act as Grand Chaplain, Grand Secretary and Grand Marshal. The installing officers represent the respective officers of the Grand Lodge. Officers must be installed each year in December, at any time between the night of the election and up to and including St. John’s night, December 2 7th. No exception may be made to this rule except by special dispensation from the Grand Master. The Marshal should gather up the aprons and jewels and have them arranged in their proper order on a small table placed on the north side of the altar prior to the beginning of the ceremony. A copy of the Blue Book and the By-Laws of the Lodge in question should be placed on the pedestal in the east for the use of the Installing Officer. When the installation is ~private, the Lodge should be opened on the Master Mason degree. When it is public the Lodge should be opened on the Master Mason degree and then thrown open for the admis - 8 1: p 1’ p F V V sion of the guests. If the installation is to take place in another hall, the Lodge should be first opened, then proceed to the place of installation. After the ceremony, the newly-installed officers should return and properly close the Lodge, unless the Installing Officer or some other person present is authorized to close by proclamation. Music adds much to the dignity of the ceremony, not only for the marching but also a few vocal numbers are desirable. When all is in readiness, the Installing Officer says: Brethren, I am about to install the officers of Lodge, No. ___________ , Free and Accepted Masons of the state of Michigan. Right Worshipful Grand Secretary read the list of officers-elect and the officers so named will step forward to the altar and take position in order of rank, the Worshipful Master nearest the south. (Chairs may be provided.) (The Grand Secretary reads the list) Grand Marshal: __________ Most Worshipful Sir, I present to be installed as officers of ______________ Lodge, No. ____________ Free and Accepted Masons, for the ensuing Masonic year, these persons who have been duly chosen to their respective offices.

If you know of a valid 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"reason why any one of them should not be installed, state your objection now, or else forever after hold your peace. (Pause) There being no objection, I shall n ow proceed with the installation. Brethren, the first lesson we are taught in asonry, is that no man should ever enter upon any great and important undertaking without first invoking the blessing Deity. Let us, therefore, before proceeding with this important ceremony, invoke the blessing of the Supreme Architect of the Universe.

Accept us in mercy. Hear Thou our prayer and grant our earnest supplication. Amen. Response — So mote it be. Installing Officer: Worshipful Grand Marshal present the Worshipful Master- elect at the altar for installation. (The Grand Marshal takes the Master-elect by the arm, advances to the altar and says:) Most Worshipful Sir, I present to you my worthy 10 1~ brother , the Worshipful Master- elect of this Lodge to receive at your hands the rite of installation, the better to qualify him for the dis - charge of the duties of his important office. I believe him to be of good morals, and of great skill, true and trusty; and as he is a lover of our Fraternity where - soever dispersed over the face of the earth, I doubt not that he will discharge his duties with fidelity, with honor to himself and with profit to the craft. Installing Officer: Brother , from time immemorial, it has been an established custom among Free and Accepted Masons, in each Lodge, once a year at a stated period, to elect from among those who have served in a chartered Lodge as Warden, an expert craftsman, to preside over them as Worshipful Master. He must have been initiated, passed and raised in the three established degrees. He must be a lover of our noble science and have held the office of Warden. He ought to be of good report, true, trusty and held in high esteem among his brethren and fellows. He ought to be exemplary in his conduct, courteous in his manner, easy in his address, steady and pure in principle, zealous for the welfare of his Lodge, able and willing to undertake the management of the work, and well skilled in the Ancient Charges, Regulations and Landmarks.

The Holy Bible, that great light in Masonry, will guide you to all truth; it will direct your paths to the Temple of Happiness and point out to you the whole duty of man. The Square is the distinguishing jewel of your office. It is an instrument made use of by operative masons to square their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, making use of the tools of the operative craft as symbols for our moral instruction, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of squaring our actions by the square of virtue. The Compasses enable the operative workman with accuracy and precision to determine the limits and proportions of the several parts of his work. As Free and Accepted Masons, they teach us to regulate our desires in every station, so that rising to eminence by merit we may live respected and die regretted. The Book of Constitutions (holding up the Blue Book) you are to search at all times. Cause it to be read in your Lodge that none may pretend ignorance of the excellent precepts it enjoins. You now receive in your charge the Charter or Warrant from the Grand Lodge of this jurisdiction, which alone gives authority to this Lodge to meet and work, and without the presence of which no meeting I [ of the Lodge would be lawful. This you are carefully to preserve. In no case should it ever be out of your immediate control, until, at the expiration of your term, you shall have duly transmitted it to your successor in office. I need not remind you, my brother, that Charters have passed through the hands of many talented, highly esteemed and distinguished men and brethren, and in committing this Charter to your care, we feel sure its value will be properly appreciated. I also confide to your care the by-laws of your Lodge, (here the Installing Officer holds up the copy of the By-laws) which regulate the details of its own peculiar and private affairs. These by-laws you are always to see carefully and punctually executed. You will now be conducted to the east. (The Grand Marshal conducts the W. M. to the east.

THE SENIOR WARDEN Brother having been duly el: ected Senior Warden of this Lodge, you are now invested with the jewel of your office which is the Level. The Level demonstrates that we are descended from I V the same stock, partake of the same nature, share the same hopes, and though distinctions among men are necessary to preserve subordination and resulting order, yet no eminence of station should make us forget that we are brethren; and that he, who is placed on the lowest spoke of fortune’s wheel may be entitled to our regard; because the time will come and the wisest knows now how soon, when all distinctions but that of virtue shall cease, and Death, the great leveler of human greatness, will reduce us to the same state. Your regular attendance at our stated meetings is essentially necessary. In the absence of the Master, you are to govern this Lodge. In his presence, strengthen and support him. I firmly rely on your knowledge of Masonry and your attachment to your Lodge for the faithful discharge of the duties of your important trust. LOOK WELL TO THE WEST. THE JUNIOR WARDEN Brother___________________ having been duly elected Junior Warden of this Lodge, you are now invested with the jewel of your office which is the Plumb. The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations, to hold the scales of justice in equal poise, to obseAre the just distinction between intemperance and pleasure and to make our passions and prejudices coincide with the line of our duty. To you is committed the superintendence of the craft during the hour of refreshment. It is, therefore, 19 18"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"indispensably necessary that you should not only be temperate and discreet in the indulgence of your own inclinations, but carefully observe that none of the craft be suffered to convert the means of refreshment into intemperance and excess. Your regular and punctual attendance is particularly requested, and I have no doubt that you will well and faithfully perform the duties of your important trust. LOOK WELL TO THE SOUTH. THE TREASURER Brother , as you have been duly elected Treasurer of this Lodge, you are now invested with the jewel of your office which is the Crossed Keys; an emblem of security. It is your duty to receive all monies from the hands of the Secretary, keep a correct account of the same, and pay them out by order of the Worshipful Master and the consent of the Lodge. I trust your regard for the Fraternity will prompt you to the faithful dis - charge of the duties of your office. THE SECRETARY Brother _____________ , having been duly elected Secretary of this Lodge, you are now invested with the jewel of your office which is the Crossed Pens, a most appropriate emblem of your duties. It is your duty to observe all the proceedings of the Lodge; make a fair record of all things proper to be written; receive all monies due the Lodge, and pay them 20 I over to the Treasurer. Your good inclination toward Masonry, and to this Lodge, I hope will induce you to discharge the duties of your office with fidelity, and by so doing you will merit the esteem and applause of your brethren. THE CHAPLAIN (Rev.) Brother _______________ , having been ap - pointed Chaplain of this Lodge, you are now invested with the jewel of your office, which is appropriately an open Bible. It is your duty to perform those solemn services which we should constantly render to our Infinite Creator, and which, when offered by one whose holy profession is ‘to point to Heaven and lead the way’ may, by refining our souls, strengthening our virtues and purifying our minds, prepare us for admission into the society of those above, whose happiness will be as endless as it is perfect. THE SENIOR DEACON Brother_____________________ , as you have been duly elected Senior Deacon of this Lodge, you are now invested with the jewel of your office which is the Square and Compasses enclosing a blazing sun. It is your duty to attend on the Worshipful Master and to act as his proxy in the active duties of the Lodge, such as the reception of ~candidates into the different degrees of Masonry; the introduction and accomo - dation of visiting brethren and other duties. The impressiveness of all the ceremonies of the Lodge 21"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"will depend largely upon the dignity and efficiency with which you perform your duties and I doubt not that the duties of this office in your hands, will receive due care and attention. THE JUNIOR DEACON Brother ___________________ , having been duly elected Junior Deacon of this Lodge, you are now invested with the appropriate jewel of your office, which is the Square and Compasses enclosing a half- moon. The similarity of your jewel to that of the Senior Deacon, indicates, in a measure, the similarity of your duties to his. You are the active proxy of the Wardens, and it is also your duty to see that the Lodge is duly tiled. I doubt not that you will be diligent and faithful in the discharge of your duties. THE STEWARDS Brothers __________ and __________ , you have been appointed (or elected) the Stewards of this Lodge, and are now each invested with the jewel of your office, which is the cornucopia, signifying plenty, and symbolic of your duties when the brethren are at refreshment. It is your duty to see that the tables are properly furnished at refreshment and that every brother is properly provided for. When the Lodge is at work you also have a very important part as assistants of the Deacons and other officers in performing their respective duties. Your regular and prompt attendance will afford the best proof of your zeal and attachment to the Lodge. 22 THE MARSHAL i I Brother , as you have been ap - pointed Marshal of this Lodge, you will now be invested with the proper jewel of your office, which is the Crossed Batons, an emblem of your authorita - tive directing power. It is your province to have charge of the Lodge on all public occasions when it is in line of march, and you will therefore be respon - sible for the proper appearance of the brethren on those public occasions, both as to the manner and character of their dress, the dignity of their appearance and the skill with which they perform the various evolutions prescribed by our Masonic ceremonies. When in the Lodge, your station will be near the Master, in order that you may assist him in every means in your power, in the quiet and orderly disposition of the business of the Lodge and the conduct of its work. I doubt not that your interest in the welfare of the Lodge, will prompt you to exercise your best endeavors to discharge properly the duties of your office. THE TILER Brother_____________ , you are appointed Tiler of this Lodge and I invest you with the implement of your office. As the sword is placed in the hands of the Tiler to enable him to effectually guard against 23"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"the approach of cowans or eavesdroppers, and suffer none to pass or repass without permission; so it should admonish us to set a guard over our thoughts, a watch at our lips and post a sentinel over our actions, thereby preventing the approach of every unworthy thought or deed to our hearts, and preserving our conscience void of offense towards God and man. (Vocal or instrumental music may be introduced here.) CHARGE TO THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER (Arise) Worshipful Master, the Grand Lodge having committed to your care the superintendence and government of the brethren who compose this Lodge, I place in your hand the gavel, the emblem of your authority as a ruler of the craft. You cannot be insensible of the obligations which devolve on you as their head, nor of your responsibilities for the faithful discharge of the important duties attached to your office. The honor, reputation and usefulness of your Lodge will materially depend on the skill and assiduity with which you manage its concerns; while the happiness of its members will be generally promoted in proportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the genuine principles of the institution. As a pattern for imitation, consider the sun, which rising in the east regularly diffuses light and luster to all within its circle. In like manner, it is in your province to spread and communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your Lodge. Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high character of Masonry; and seriously admonish them never to dis - grace it. Charge them to practice out of the Lodge those duties which they have been taught in it, and by amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct to con - vince mankind of the goodness of the institution; so that when any man is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrow, to whom distress may proffer its suit, whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence. In short, by a diligent observance of the by- laws of your Lodge, the constitution of Masonry, and above all, the Holy Scriptures, which are given as a rule and guide to your faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with honor and satisfaction, and lay up a crown of rejoicing, which shall continue until time shall be no more. CHARGE TO THE WARDENS (Arise) Brother Senior and Junior Wardens, you are too well acquainted with the principles of Masonry, to warrant any distrust that you will be found wanting in the discharge of your respective duties. Suffice it to mention, that what you have found praiseworthy in others, you should certainly imitate; and what in 25 24"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"them may have appeared defective you should in yourselves amend. You should be examples of good order and regularity; for it is only by a due regard for the laws in your own conduct, that you may expect obedience to them from others. You are assiduously to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust, diffusing light and imparting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of the Master, you will succeed to higher duties; your acquirements must therefore be such that the craft may never suffer for the want of proper instruction. From the spirit you have hitherto evinced, I enter - tain no doubt that your future conduct will be such as to merit the applause of your brethren and the testimony of a good conscience. CHARGE TO THE BRETHREN OF THE LODGE (Calls up Lodge) Brethren of Lodge, such is the nature of our constitution, that as some must of necessity rule and teach, so others must, of course, learn to submit and obey. Humility in both is an essential duty. The officers who are chosen to govern the Lodge, are sufficiently conversant with the rules of propriety and the laws of the institution to avoid exceeding the powers with which they are intrusted, and you are of too generous disposition to envy their preferment. I therefore trust that you will have but one aim; to please each other, and to unite in the I - I I - grand design of being happy and communicating happiness. Finally, my brethren, as this institution has been formed and perfected in so much unity and concord, in which we greatly rejoice, so may it long continue. May you enjoy every satisfaction and delight which disinterested friendship can afford. May kindness and brotherly affection distinguish your conduct as men and Masons. Within your peaceful walls, may your children and your children’s children, celebrate with joy and gratitude the annual recurrence of this auspicious solemnity; and may the tenets of our noble order be transmitted through your Lodge, — pure and unimpaired from generation to generation. Worshipful Grand Marshal — make the pro - clamation. (Grand Marshal) — In the name of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the state of Michigan, I proclaim that the officers of Lodge, No. ______ have been duly installed. This I proclaim from the South. The craft will take due notice thereof and govern themselves accordingly. Brethren — Together attend the Grand Honors (Once) (Proclamation given in the west with Grand Honors — twice. Proclamation given in the east, with Grand Honors — thrice.) (The installing officer should not join in the Grand Honors.) 26 27"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS Short Form This shorter form of installation may be used for private installations. The same rules as outlined for the long form installation apply, and there should be no abbreviation of the ceremony insofar as the installation of the Master-elect is concerned. In no case should the propounding of the Ancient Charges and Regulations and the Master-elect’s assent to them be omitted. After the oath of fidelity is repeated in unison by the several officers-elect and the members of the Lodge, the following may be said: (My brothers, this Lodge has honored you greatly. Each of you should realize your responsibility. It is to be assumed that you know your duties thoroughly, and you are solemnly bound to discharge them faith - fully. You will now each be invested with the insignia of your offices and assume your stations and places as officers of this Lodge.) The charge should then be given to the Worshipful Master, Wardens and brethren of the Lodge; followed by the proclamation in. the south, west and east accompanied by the Grand Honors. 28 Ii 1~ L PRESCRIBED SERVICES FOR DECEASED MASONS ANNUAL LODGE MEMORIAL SERVICE General Directions I. The services may be held in the Lodge room, either privately or publicly; or in some church or public hall, when they are, of course, public. When not in the Lodge room, the Lodge meets in its Lodge room and is marched in the usual order of procession to the hall or church. The Master occupies the center of a raised plat - form at one end of the building, the Senior and Junior Wardens in front of him, at his right and left, respectively, and facing each other. When in a church, the Master may occupy the pulpit, the Senior and Junior Wardens sitting in the altar space in front, facing each other at the right and left, respectively, of the Master, the Senior Deacon at the right front corner of the altar space, and the Junior Deacon at the left front corner. II. A catafalque should be erected about six feet long by four feet wide, on which are placed two uniformly smaller platforms in succession so that the whole represents three steps, each in appropriate height above the other. On the top of the last is placed an urn filled with clean, dry sand, and of material capable of resisting the action of heat. The sand should be thoroughly saturated with alcohol. 29"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"IlL If the services are in the Lodge room, the catafalque should be placed in the center of the Lodge; in a public hall, at some convenient place near the Master’s station; if in a church, in the altar space in front of the pulpit. Whether in a hall or church, it should be between the Senior and Junior Wardens. IV. At each corner of the catafalque should be a tall silver candlestick holding a taper. On the catafalque should be placed a pair of white gloves and an apron. When the services are in memory of more than one brother, placards may be placed around the catafalque, each bearing the name of one of the memorialized brethren. V. The Lodge room (or the hail or church) should be appropriately draped in white and black cloth. The catafalque should be covered with black cloth. When the bottom platform rests on legs, (which is a more convenient and cheaper form), the black cloth should hang down all around it to the floor concealing the legs and presenting an appearance of a solid altar draped in black with three successive tiers or platforms. Two wreaths of white flowers and a wreath of evergreen should be provided. VI. On a pedestal at the side and to the front of the Master should be placed a lighted taper. The brethren should be dressed, and the regalia draped, as on funeral occasions. Each brother should wear a sprig of evergreen on his left breast. VII. Appropriate music will add much to the impressiveness of the program. II Service W.M. (Standing) — “0 praise the Lord, all ye nations; praise Him all ye people. For His merciful kindness is great towards us; and the truth of the Lord endureth forever. Praise ye the Lord.” Psalm cxviii. S.W.

Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, and who shall stand in His holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation:” Psalm xxiv: 1-5. J.W. (Standing) — “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me! Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou anointest my head ~with oil; my cup runneth over.

W.M. — Brother Junior Warden, what sentiments should inspire the souls of Masons on occasions like this? J.W. — Calm sorrow for the absence of our brethren who have gone before us; earnest solicitude for our own eternal welfare, and a firm faith and reliance upon the wisdom and goodness of God. W.M. — Brethren, commending this sentiment to your earnest consideration, and invoking your assistance in the solemn ceremonies abou.t to take place, I declare this Lodge of Sorrow opened.

MASONIC BURIAL SERVICE General Instructions The Masonic Funeral Service may be had for any Master Mason, in good standing in his Lodge, who during his lifetime, may have requested such service, or whose immediate family, after his death, may communicate such request to the Worshipful Master of the Lodge of which he died a member. The Master of the Lodge, having received notice of the death of a brother Master Mason and a request that he be buried with the ceremonies of the craft, will then officially request the Secretary to summon the Lodge for the time and place agreed upon for the funeral, providing he has satisfied himself on the following requirements:. 1. The deceased brother must have been a Mason at the time of his death. 2. He must have been in .good standing, not 42 7 f 1; p V L under penalty of suspension or expulsion. If charges had been p referred for non-payment of dues and he dies before trial he is entitled to a Masonic funeral. 3. A Lodge may give to a brother who has committed suicide a Masonic burial. Upon the death of a sojourner, who had expressed a desire to be buried with Masonic honors, and official directions having been received from the deceased Master Mason’s home Lodge, the duties herein prescribed will devolve upon the Master of the Lodge within whose jurisdiction the death occurred; and if in a place where there is more than one Lodge, then upon the Master of the oldest Lodge, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon. No Lodge shall form a public procession for the funeral of a brother without the permission of its Master, his legal representative, or the Grand Master. In the event civic societies, the police or military organizations desire to unite with the Masons in the burial of a Master Mason, the body of the deceased must be in charge of the Lodge having jurisdiction and the Masonic services in all respects to be conducted as if none but Masons were in attendance. If the deceased was a Grand or Past Grand Officer, the Grand Master should be officially notified at once, through the Grand Secretary, of the passing of one of their number. In the event the Grand Lodge is to perform the funeral the Grand Master will then forward instruc 43"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"tions for the direction of the Constituent Lodge in connection with the Masonic Service. If the deceased was the Grand Master then the Deputy Grand Master will forward instructions as above. The active pall bearers must be Master Masons named by the deceased brother, or selected by the family, the Worshipful Master or the Grand Master. If the deceased brother was a Knight Temp lar or Scottish Rite Mason, the Lodge in charge may ask either or both organizations to act as an escort. It is not proper for a Masonic Lodge to co-mingle in its exercises (funeral or other) with any other society. A Masonic Lodge should have entire charge of the interment service or decline to take part. A Lodge may attend a funeral as a mourner, no matter by whom the funeral ceremony is conducted; provided however that it shall not unite with any other organization in conducting the ceremony. When a Lodge assumes charge of the funeral cere - mony, the Lodge only must conduct the service, and no person not a Master Mason shall be allowed to participate. The Lodge can take charge at any time prior to interment. If the remains are to lie in state in the Lodge room, church, or elsewhere, a guard of honor may be selected. One guard to be stationed at the head and the other at the foot of the casket. Guards may serve in relays. If the deceased was a Past Master it is 44 j7 I I fitting for the Past Masters to serve as guard of honor. If the deceased brother is to be buried in another jurisdiction, the Lodge, church or house service may be held with or without a procession from the Lodge room. However, when such service is completed the Lodge shall close in due form. A Lodge has no right to conduct funeral services in another Grand Jurisdiction without the consent of the Grand Master of Michigan and the Grand Master whose jurisdiction they are invading. If the remains are to be buried in another Grand Jurisdiction and the deceased brother’s family desires a Masonic Burial Service at the Grave, the local Worshipful Master will wire such request to the Michigan Grand Secretary who will effect the necessary arrangements. Any expense incurred by the foreign Lodge in performing such burial service shall devolve upon the requesting Michigan Lodge. When Lodge A desires to inter a deceased brother in the jurisdiction of Lodge B, they may do so, but Lodge B conducts the service. However, as a matter of courtesy, Lodge B may permit Lodge A to perform the service. Lodge B must open in the regular form before the service and at its completion return to their Lodge room and be closed. The Tiler of th~ Lodge should see to it that the jewels, gavel and furniture are in their proper places, also a plentiful supply of clean aprons, gloves and sprigs of evergreen for the brethren. Clothing should 45"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"be white gloves and aprons. The apron is to be worn on the outside of the coat, and the sprig of evergreen on the left breast. The officers of the Lodge should wear their official aprons and jewels and the same applies to any Past Masters and Grand Lodge officers. The Secretary should have in readiness an obituary roll on which is inscribed the name, age and Masonic history of the deceased, also the date of his death. When the family desires to recognize friends~ who are not Master Masons; they may act as honorary pall-bearers but they cannot have any part in the Masonic ceremony. The Marshal of the Lodge is in charge. All matters of route, music, and arrangements with the undertaker are made by him on order from the Worshipful Master. LODGE ROOM The Lodge being opened on the Master Mason degree, the Worshipful Master states the purpose of the meeting, selects the required officers and pall - bearers if necessary, and proceeds with the Lodge or Church service if desired. The Lodge (or a “Lodge of Sorrow”) having been properly opened, the presence of the charter while the Lodge is in procession or at the grave is not necessary. The funeral procession is formed as follows: 46 I I?

The Lodge in charge at the rear. The Grand Master, if present 1 takes precedence over all. Should the deceased have been a member of Royal Arch Chapter, Council of Royal and Select Masters, Scottish Rite or a Commandery of Knights Templar, and members of those bodies should unite in the procession, clothed ~s such, they precede the Master Masons. The Knights Templar may act as an escort or guard of honor to the deceased, marching outside of the line of pall-bearers. 47"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"When the head of the procession nears its destination, the Marshal will command “Open Order-March” thus forming two parallel lines. He wiJI then halt the procession and command “Inward-Face.” The Worshipful Master followed by the entire procession in reverse order, then passes through the lines, entering the building. The Tiler will take and maintain his place just outside the entrance; the Marshal being in active charge of the brethren. After the religious services, if any, have been concluded at the residence, funeral home or church; providing there is to be a Masonic, House or Church Service, the Worshipful Master will take his station at the head of the casket; the Senior Warden at the foot and the Junior Warden at the side of the casket to the left of the Worshipful Master.

The Deacons stand immediately back of the Worshipful Master with their rods crossed. The Stewards just inside the door of the building. The brethren grouped as conveniently as space will permit. If the weather is stormy or wintry the interment service with slight changes in the wording to fit the occasion may also be performed in the home or church with the exception of the commitment, farewell and final prayer which must be given at the grave or mausoleum. V U V I I I V IL - V V F I - I: L Ii On the completion of the Masonic, House or Church service the brethren will return outside. The Marshal will reverse the lines and open order, bringing the head of the lines (inverse order) near the hearse, the rear being near the door of the building, leaving sufficient space for the officers to occupy their original positions on leaving the building. The Master and officers will retire from the building in the following order: Tiler, with drawn Sword Stewards with rods Treasurer and Secretary Senior and Junior Warden The Brother with the Great Lights Worshipful Master, supported by Deacons with rods On leaving the building the Tiler and Stewards will proceed at once to their place at the head of the procession near the hearse.

As soon as the immediate relatives have passed through the lines, 48 49"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"F. the lines will right and left face and close order, commencing at the rear to prevent confusion caused by the general exit of friends from the building through the lines; making no forward movement until the head of the column moves, by order of the Marshal, which will be when all the relatives have passed through the lines to their carriages. The lines will then move to the head of the procession on foot or in their carriages, then proceed to the place of interment, the order of the procession being as it left the Lodge room. The Masonic services at the residence, funeral home, church or grave will take place after all the religious services are concluded and will commence upon the officers taking their place about the casket as provided for in the Committal Service. When the head of the procession shall have arrived at the place of interment, the lines will be in open order formation, the highest ranking officer, precede by the Tiler will pass through and the brethren will follow, in inverse order as at the church. If the remains are to be placed in a tomb or mausoleum the Tiler should take his place in front of the open door, with the Stewards on either side of the entrance and the brethren grouped conveniently as occasion permits. - Upon return to the Lodge room, the Master will appoint an Obituary committee, transact any business that may be permitted within the call for the special meeting and close the Lodge in due form.

My brethren and friends, it is a time-honored custom among the fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, at the request of a brother, to accompany his remains to the place of interment and deposit them with the usual ceremonies. In conformity to this custom we have assembled in the character of Masons, to offer up to his memory before the world, this tribute of our affection, thereby demonstrating the sincerity of our past esteem for him. ln fulfilling this sad duty, we are called to assemble among the habitations of the dead, and to behold the narrow house appointed for all living. Here around us, in that peace which the world cannot give, sleep the unnumbered dead. The gentle breezes fan their verdant covering; they heed it not. The sunshine and the storm pass over them and they are not disturbed. Stones and lettered monuments symbolize the affection of surviving friends and mark the last resting place of the beloved dead. While the occasion admonishes us to consider the uncertainty of human life and the unremitt able certainty of death, with equal urgency it graciously invites us to regard death as the open doot, through which man passes from his labors on earth to the nobler service of life in the world to come.

(All brothers in close proximity to the casket, step forward and deposit their evergreen. It is not desirable that any marching around the casket be done, due to the resulting confusion.) (The WorshiPful Master, having taken up a handful offlowers or earth says:) Forasmuch as the spirit of our departed brother hath returned unto God who gave it; we therefore, now, commit his body to the grave. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; looking for the general resurrection at the last day and the life of the world to come. Brethren; join in Grand Honors (Once). Brethren; the last offices which we pay to the dead serve a three-fold purpose. They do reverent honor to a deceased brother. They are meant to convey to L L those who feel most keenly this afflictive dispensation, the blessed assurance of our Heavenly Father’s protecting care, and the alluring hope of a happy reunion in the Celestial City, whose builder and maker is God. Finally, they constitute a lesson to the living. It matters not now to him whether two or three gather around the grave to pefform his funeral ritual, or that hundreds have assembled with the insignia of the craft to deposit him in his final resting place. It is of little moment whether the wild winds chant his requiem or it be accompanied with rare and costly music and the minstrelsy of many voices. He has gone to accomplish the destiny of our race. While we pause to shed the sympathetic tear over the grave of our departed brother, let us cast around his foibles, whatever they may have been, the broad mantle of Masonic Charity, nor withhold from his memory the commendation his virtues deserve. And now my brethren, let us ponder well the lessons of this hour. We are born, we live, we die. But is death the end of man and the expiring hope of all faithful Masons? No — Blessed be God. We pause not on our first or second step, but true to our profession look forward for greater light. As the span of our earthly existence is drawing to a close; the Bible, that Great Light in Masonry, removes the dark cloud and bids hope and joy rise up to cheer and sustain us.

The first candle we light to our God, from Whom all light must come, and without Whom the work - men toil in vain. “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.” This candle we light in testimony of our shared Faith, so beautifully expressed in the words of the 23rd Psalm. How comforting to us now is the assurance that our Brother so kept the Faith and so displayed, on every occasion, his trust in our God that he has now real - ized the promise in these words; “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?” In the ritual of one of the branches of our Masonic Fraternity is the oft-repeated phrase: “My Hope is in God.” We light this candle to that Hope and wish for eternal life by which each of us must live, and to the realization of that desire by our departed Brother. “Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.” “And the greatest of these is Charity.” How often, as Masons, we are taught the charity of caring for those less fortunate, and are reminded of the nobler Char - ity of forgiving and forgetting the errors and irregu - larities which we may have felt were inflicted on us. In token of the true charity of word, thought, and ii I 4 deed as evidenced by our departed Brother in as - suring his place at the Throne of Grace, we light this candle to Charity. “Behold how good and how pleasant it is for Breth - ren to dwell together in unity.” One of the strongest bonds of society is man’s dependence on man, and nowhere does the feeling of mutual assistance and affection find greater expression than in the friendly smile and warm handclasp of a Brother. In lighting V this candle to Brotherly Love, we express our appre - ciation for the days we have been cheered by the genuine warmth of our Brother who has left us for a time, and our sincere conviction that, ere long, we shall clasp again his hand in the Brotherly Love of our Craft. Whom virtue has united, naught can sep - arate. “Preserve me, 0 God: for in Thee do I put my trust. Thou wilt show me the path of life: in Thy Presence is fullness of joy: at Thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.” The candle of Remem - brance is lighted in tribute to all the myriads who have placed their trust in God, and have been called home to Him. Particularly, in this hour, we remem - ber Brother________________ (Insert History and! or Eulogy here) May the memory of our Brother’s virtue be ever engraved on the tablet of our heart. “Lord, who shall abide in Thy Tabernacle? Who 68 69"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"I I 2j ‘i I shall dwell in Thy Holy Hill? He that walketh up - rightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.” Truth is one of the cardinal principles of Free-masonry, and it is in the search of truth and light that we, as Masons, learn the lessons of the several Degrees of the Craft, as exemplified by the charges and lectures pertaining to each. We light now a candle to the greatest Truth of all: — The Truth, as now affirmed anew by our Brother, that in God is Eternal Glory in the realm beyond the skies. “Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. And let beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish Thou the work of our hands upon us; Yea, the work of our hands establish Thou it.” The final candle in our candelabra of memory we light in our belief in the Resurrection and the Life Eternal. May this thought be ever with us to cheer and sustain, as it cheered and comforted our Brother, and may we share with family and friends the words of the poet, Alfred Tennyson, who expressed so well his philosophy and his belief.
