Before your investiture, it is necessary that you should signify your assent to those Ancient Charges and Regu - lations, which define the duty of a Master of a Lodge of Perfection. Listen, therefore, and when you have heard all, respond! 10 You admit that it is not in the power of any man, or body of men to make innovations in the essential and fundamental principles of Free - masonry. 2~ You agree to hold in veneration the ancient landmarks and great principles of Masonry; to respect and obey the Authorities of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Supreme and Subordi - nate, according to their stations; to uphold the dignity and honor of the Rite, and strictly to con - form to all Edicts of the Supreme Council, not sub - versive of the principles and groundwork of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Free - masonry. 30 You agree that an avowed atheist can not be lawfully made a Mason; and that any Power, calling itself Masonic, which permits its Lodges to initiate atheists, or its higher bodies to receive them, is necessarily not Masonic. 40 You agree to assert and defend the rights of the People, and to maintain their liberties, holding those only to be valid laws which have been enacted with their consent, constitutionally expressed. 50 You promise to be the advocate and sup - porter of good government, law and order, in harmony with individual freedom and the rights of man; to engage in no plots or conspiracies against such a government; to submit peacefully to the will of the majority, constitutionally and legally expressed; to pay proper respect to the con - stituted authorities of your country, and to en - deavor to be of service to it, and to the Society in which you live. 6~ You agree that every Mason should pursue some reputable occupation; should live decorously and decently, and should act with honor, fidelity, and generosity towards all men. 70 You are to permit none to visit your Lodge, except such as are Perfect E lus of the obedience of some Supreme Council recognized as legitimate by the Supreme Council of the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States; and you will give no counte - nance to persons who belong to spurious organiza - tions pretending to be Powers of the Scottish Rite. 80 You promise not to consent to admission into, or honor in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, of men who traffic in Masonic Degrees, or who live upon Freemasonry without returning it a full equivalent. 90 You agree to endeavor to diffuse the prin - ciples of the Scottish Freemasonry; to attend regu - larly the meetings of your.

Answer: I do. CHARGE TO THE MASTER 1• 0.. My Brother, your ready assent to the Charges and Regulations of the Order, justifies the confidence which your Brdhren have reposed in you, and authorizes me to proceed to install you as Master of this Lodge of Perfection. You cannot have advanced to the degree which you have attained in Masonry, without becoming acquainted with the requisites necessary to con - stitute an efficient Master of a Lodge, with the duties that devolve upon him, and with the serious responsibilities which he incurs. The honor, reputation and usefulness of your Lodge will chiefly depend upon the mode in which you discharge the duties of your office. If you should be satisfied with merely knowing by rote the formulas, the phrases and the ceremonial of the work, and end with that your care and concern for your Lodge, you may maintain good order, and conduct the work with regularity; but you will soon see indifference succeed to zeal, inattention to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"14 OFFICES OF INSTALLATION OF A LODGE OF PERFECTION 15 punctuality, lassitude to interest, and stagnant immobility to activity. Whenever your Lodge is closed, and an evening has passed away without your having given the Brethren some new and useful information, you will have failed to do your duty. You are to arouse the indolent, encourage the desponding, and invite the unreflecting Brethren to do something, the influences whereof shall be felt beyond the limits of the Lodge; something for society, something for the State, something for humanity. Above all, see to it that their Masonry does not evaporate in words and professions; that they do not lay it aside when they retire from the Lodge; that their vows, lightly taken, be not vaguely re - membered and little regarded. Charge them to practice out of the Lodge the duties taught in it; and by their forbearance, toleration, fairness, frankness, discretion, equity and profound regard for truth and honor, to con - vince all who know them of the excellence of our Institution, so that it may again come to be the case that one shall need no other voucher, with worthy and good men, than that he is a Mason of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite; so that, when any one is a Member of our Order, the world may know that he is not only one whose conduct is governed by justice, and his heart expanded by benevolence—not only one to whom the sad soul will never in vain make known its sorrows and distress—never in vain prefer its suit—but one to whom the OPpressed may confidently appeal for aid against the Oppressor; the People against its Tyrants, the Conscience against those who hold it bound in chains, and repress as crimes even its quivering convulsions. We hope that you will, in all respects, and under all circumstances, perform your duty; and that when you retire from office, your example will remain as the best and brightest of lessons for your successors; to show them in what way to walk, and how to act so as to deserve well of the Order, and be entitled to its gratitude. CHARGE TO THE SENIOR WARDEN I.~. O.. Brother A H , your Brethren have seen fit to elect you Senior Warden of this Lodge of Perfection. In the absence of the Master, you are to govern the Lodge and perform the duties of his office; and in that case, you are bound by all the pledges and promises that he has made for himself; and will consider all that has been said to him as addressed equally to you. When he is present you are to assist him and second all his efforts. Your acquaintance with the history, sym - bols and philosophy of Masonry should be as ex - tensive as his; and by diligent study and profound reflection, you should so prepare yourself as never to be taken unawares when called to the perform-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"16 OFFICE5 OF JNSTALLATION OF A LODGE OF PERFECTION 17 ance of any duty. Your regular attendance on the meetings of the Lodge is indispensably necessary; and you should particularly exert yourself to make these meetings interesting and profitable. The success of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite must depend upon the Lodges, and not upon the Superior Bodies. You are the Masonic People; and if you are few in numbers, without interest in the cause, indifferent, inactive and indolent, it will be useless for the Higher Bodies to strive to elevate and advance the Rite. We firmly rely on your knowledge, your zeal for the Order and your at - tachment to your Lodge, for the faithful discharge of the duties of this important trust. CHARGE TO THE JUNIOR WARDEN I.~. O.~. Brother E W , your Brethren have seen fit to elect you to be the Junior Warden of this Lodge of Perfection. You may be called on to fill the place of the Senior Warden, or even of the Master; and in such case, the promises they have respectively made become yours; and what has been said to them has been addressed to yoi~. You should therefore be as fully instructed as they; and your office demands of you the same diligent study and thoughtful reflection. During the hours of refreshment the Craft are under your charge. You are to be careful to see that none of them degrade the innocent and tem - perate convivality of Masonry into intemperance and excess. Walk ever uprightly in your station. Hold the sgales of justice in equal poise. Yourself observe the just medium between intemperance and pleasure; and never permit your passions and prejudices to lead you into injustice or a violation of duty. Your regular and punctual attendance is re - quired by our laws, and you should so perform every duty that, when you retire from office, you will be followed by the regrets and good opinion of those who have manifested their high estimate of your character and qualifications by electing you to this honorable and responsible office. CHARGE TO THE ORATOR J~ O.. Brother F M , your Brethren have seen fit to express their good opinion of you by electing you to be the Orator of this Lodge of Perfection. It will be your duty to pronounce a discourse to the Initiate at every reception, and to the Lodge on the occasion of the death of any Brother; and when the Lodge thinks fit, it may also, of right, call on you to read an essay or lecture upon the History, Philosophy, Doctrine or Symbol - ism of the Order. It is, therefore, indispensable that you should make yourself familiar with these subjects, so that you may be able to instruct and enlighten the Brethren; and so that your addresses and discourses may be worthy to be laid up and preserved in the archives of the Lodge. We trust"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"18 OFFICE5 OF INSTALLATION OF A LODGE OF PERFECTION 19 that the duties of your office will be so performed that your name will be hereafter identified with the prosperous fortunes and good repute of the Lodge, and be mentioned with honor and respect by all who love the Royal Art. CHARGE TO THE ALMONER I.~. O.•. Brother W P , your Brethren have seen fit to elect you to be the Almoner of this Lodge of Perfection. You are to dispense the Charities of the Lodge. I trust your office may not prove a sinecure. Ma - sonry is singularly boastful, and yet expends too little in charity, in proportion to the means of her members, and even to the abundance of her reve - nues. The expenses of the varied machinery of Representative Masonic Government are out of all proportion to the sums which Grand and Subordi - nate Bodies contribute to relieve want, and allevi - ate distress. How can they but fall into disfavor with Him whose Wards the Poor, the Destitute, and the Hungry are, if they neglect to avail them - selves of the constant opportunities which He gives them to deserve and gain His favor, and if they use to little purpose their abundant means and powers to do good? It is your particular duty to seek out deserving objects for these charities, to see the widows and orphans of the Order provided for, and the sick watched with and tenderly cared for. You will particularly see that your Lodge never closes until the Box of Fraternal Assistance has been passed round; and that no Brother withdraw before that time arrives, without depositing his contribution with one of the Wardens. And you will always be careful, in bestowing funds so obtained, never to let it be known by the recipient from what source such relief proceeds. It is our earnest wish that you may so admin - ister the affairs of your office, that, when you lay it down, the exchequer of the Lodge may overflow with the thanks of widows and the gratitude of orphans. CHARGE TO THE SECRETARY I.. O.~. Brother C S ,the Brethren have seen fit to elect you to be the Secretary of this Lodge of Perfection. It is your duty to record all the proceedings of the Lodge, to receive all moneys due the Lodge, and pay them over to the Treasurer, and keep a just and true account of the same; to keep and affix the seal of the Lodge, and carefully to preserve its archives. These are very important duties, on which, in a very great measure, the use - fulness of the Lodge depends. If you suffer the degrees to be conferred on credit, or the Brethren to fall into arrears, the charitable purposes of the Lodge will often be defeated, and ill-feeling and discontent engendered among the Members. Ac - curacy and punctuality are qualities which your"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"20 OFFICES OF IN5TALLATION OF A LODGE OF PERFECTION 21 office particularly requires: and as there is no place in the Lodge in which you can render more sub - stantial service to the Brethren, I earnestly hope that you will so perform its duties as to merit their esteem~and receive their thanks. CHARGE TO THE TREASURER I.~. O.~. Brother P M , your Brethren have seen fit to elect you to be the Treasurer of this Lodge of Perfection. It is your duty to receive all moneys from the Secretary, make due entry of the same, and pay them out on the order of the Lodge, rendering accounts thereof at the proper season. These duties are responsible and impor - tant; and your faithful performance of them will entitle you to the good opinion and gratitude of your Brethren. CHARGE TO ALL THE ELECTED OFFICERS I.~. O.~. My Brethren, Elected Officers of the Lodge. That you deserve the Offices conferred upon you, the choice of your Brethren gives rea - sonable ground to believe. That you have not gained them by the despicable practices borrowed from political demagogues, we do not need to be assured. It only remains that you should so per - form all your official duties as to deserve well of Masonry. We call ourselves Perfect Masons, and our Lodges, Lodges of Perfection. We ought to know at least what these titles mean, and to what duties we become bound by accepting them. You are to be the chief, each in his station of this Body of Elect and Perfect Masons. It is self- denial, self-sacrifice that are grand and sublime. It is those who are capable of these, that are Elect Masons, and those who perfect the sacrifice of self, are Perfect. These alone serve humanity effi - ciently. Each of you has firmly and solemnly appren - ticed himself to honor and duty, and the sentiment of these is a religious sentiment. It is for you to teach the Brethren self—sacrifice, by examples; by the sacrifice of your own interests and pleasures to duty. If you do that, office will ennoble you. Then you will indeed be, what other - wise you cannot become, Perfect Masons. Duty is clearly traced and easy to follow in all the relations of life. Hate and revenge, jealousy and envy are never duties. To embody these, or selfish interest, in individual action or in legisla - tion, is a sad mistake. The spirit of Loving-Kind - ness and that of duty cannot be separated from each other. Masonry is the spirit of Loving- kindness, for it is Brotherhood, permits no evil- speaking of each other, and inculcates the “love” so continually insisted on by John the Apostle. And Masonry will be Masonry again, when its almost nominal brotherhood becomes real, and the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"22 OFFICE5 OF INSTALLATION OF A LODGE OF PERFECTION 23 spirit of Loving-kindness is Sovereign among the Brethren. It is time for the work of regeneration to begin; and in this work, by the restoration of this spirit, every man has it in his power to do something. Let the regeneration begin here. Live together here, all of you, as Masons should; for the life of Ma - sonry is but a useless life, so long as this work remains undone. I.~. O.. Brother Master of Ceremonies, place these Brethren, the Officers Elect of this Lodge of Perfection, at the Altar, in due form, to take the vow of office. M.~. C.. arranges them in a semicircle, the Master elect in the center on the west side of the Altar, the others on his right and left alternately according to rank, all facing it, causes each to kneel on the right knee, and to lay the right hand on the heart and hold up the left hand and says: M.’.

He then repeats the vow OF OFFICE You do each solemnly vow that you will support, protect and defend the Constitutions, Regulations and Institutes of the Ancient and Accepted Scot - tish Rite, and the Statutes of the Supreme Council, and will to the best and utmost of your ability, faithfully and zealously perform the duties of the offices to which you have respectively been elected, without fear or favor, prejudice or partiality, having always in view the interest and honor of the Order, and disregarding all promptings and persuasion of unkindness, envy, self-interest or ambition. Each will answer: I do, so help me God! I.~. 0.’. Rise, my Brethren. I.. 0.’. and M.’.

May you wear them with honor, and when you lay them aside, may it be against the wishes of your Brethren. I.~. 0.~. now returns to the East, and says, I.’. 0..

Though Masonry is not a religion, I am sure that in min - istering at its altars, the services you perform will lose nothing of their beneficent influence, because they are practiced in that spirit of universal toler - ance which distinguishes our Institution. CHARGE TO THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES Brother the Venerable Master has been pleased to appoint you Master of Cere - monies of this Lodge of Perfection. It will be your duty to announce and introduce all visiting Breth - ren; to introduce and accompany the candidate; to arrange all processions and act as Marshal there - of; to superintend all funeral ceremonies, and to act as the Executive Officer of the Venerable Master. These varied and important duties, es - sential to regularity and order, will require of you acquaintance with the work, promptness and punc - tuality. I trust that you will perform them to the entire satisfaction of the Venerable Master and the Lodge. CHARGE TO THE EXPERT AND ASSISTANT EXPERT Brethren and the Venerable Master has been pleased to appoint you respectively to be the Expert and Assistant Expert of this Lodge of Perfection. It will be your duty to examine visitors not vouched for, and to examine and prepare the candidates.

You are under the direction of the Mas -"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"27 OF A LODGE OF PERFECTION 26 OFFICE5 OF INSTALLATION ter of Ceremonies, and will perform such other duties as, by usage and custom and according to the Rituals, appertain to your offices. Your vigi - lance and attention, and your familiarity with your duties will much conduce to the order and harmony of the Lodge and be duly appreciated by your Brethren, who will soon learn how important it is that the Lodge should have competent and zealous Experts. Unless you should prove such, the Officers over you will toil in vain, and be con - tinually vexed with disappointments and annoyed by lame and halting work. Remember that the post of honor is the post of duty. CHARGE TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE HOST Brother , th~ Venerable Master has been pleased to appoint you to be the Captain of the Host of this Lodge of Perfection. It will be your duty to see that the entrance into the Temple is duly guarded, to answer all alarms, and to see that no Cowans enter, nor any others, unless the.y are known Brethren or properly vouched for, or, being examined by the Experts, prove themselves Perfect Elus. You will admit no one without per - mission from the Senior Warden. You w:ill serve all citations and other process, and obey such orders of the Venerable Master as may come to you; and be under the direction of the Master of Ceremonies. By punctual and intelligent perform - ance of these duties, you will greatly serve the Lodge, and merit the esteem of your Brethren. The servants of Kings are proud to be Chamber - lains, E~uerries, Keepers of the Royal Hounds, and Gold Sticks in Waiting. Surely a Mason may deem himself honored by any office where he has duties to perform and can render service to the Lodge and the Order; and is sufficiently rewarded by the good opinion of his fellows. CHARGE TO THE TILER Brother , the Venerable Master has been pleased to appoint you to be the Tiler of this Lodge of Perfection. You will command the Sentinels of the Arches, and see that they are duly posted, vigilant and faithful. You will guard the immediate entrance into the Temple, and see that no spius of Power or emissaries of Persecutors obtain admissior by force or fraud. I need not enlarge upon your duties. Their importance and utility are obvious. The Sentinels are the eyes of the army; and you and yours are the eyes of the Lodge. Kneel, my Brethren, and take the Vow of office.

Answer: I do. I.. O.~. Brother Senior and Junior Wardens elect, your chief functions and duties are to second and assist the Wise Master and, in his absence, one of you possesses his powers. Upon you will in a great measure depend the prosperity and usefulness of the Chapter; for if the Wardens be negligent, faithless or incompetent, the efforts of the Wise Master will rarely be effectual, and his plans, how soever well laid and carefully matured, must often fail. You have heard the promises and engage - ments of the Wise Master elect. Do each of you on your word as a good, true and loyal Knight, now promise and engage that you will remember and perform them? Each will answer: I do. 1.. O.. Brother Orator, it is your duty to deliver a discourse at every reception, and to be, on all occasions, when directed by the Wise Master, the organ of the Chapter. You should, therefore, be familiar with the his - tory and philosophy of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and be able to explain its symbols; so as to be always ready to instruct the Brethren, and to defend and vindicate the claims and the honor of the Rite. You have heard the promises and engagements of the Wise Master elect. To the same duties, with scant exception, every officer of the Chapter is, by the nature of his office and his allegiance as a Knight, obligated. Do you on your part, and so far as they are applicable to you and your office, enter into the same promises and engagements? Answer: I do. I.~. O.~. Wise Master, Senior and Junior Wardens, and Orator elect, you are the Officers of the Chap - ter, on whom its care, guidance and direction, and the instruction of the members depend. The titles you wear are pretentious. To assume and wear these titles is to. endue your duty with greater severity and observation, and subject yourselves to higher degrees of obligation."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"44 OFF[CE5 OF INSTALLATION OF A CHAPTER OF ROSE CROIX 45 Remember that whatsoever is excellent, is not to be obtained without labor or sorrow, and what - soever is easy, is trifling and worth nothing. The work of Masonry, like the work of God, cannot be done negligently and idly. In this work, one must put forth all his strength. Vain meetings and laborious trifles, and whatsoever spends much time to no real, profitable, or charitable purpose, are in no wise the work of Masonry. Leave them to those who can appreciate nothing higher, to those who love the trifling employments that merely serve to pass the time away. Teach the Knights to learn something more than the mere formulas and phrases of the ceremonial; persuade them to read the history and study the philosophy of Masonry; induce them to seek to learn the meanings of the symbols, show them how, among the heterogeneous and incoherent mass of Masonic writings, to separate the diamonds from the worthless sands; and endeavor to improve them, by counsel and discourse, by way of conduct and conversation. Brother Almoner, as every Masonic body has consented to be a Steward, to dispense the chari - ties of God, so you have consented to be the hand of the Chapter, as its Steward, to execute faith - fully that trust. “It is required in Stewards,” the Apostle says, “that a man be found faithful.” You are to dispense the charities of the Chapter, and seek out for it cases requiring relief. To perform this duty faithfully, you must become familiar with the abodes of want and suffering; and in this, and in dispensing charity, you must be persistent, perservering, energetic. It will depend upon you whether the beneficence of the Chapter shall be munificent and worthy of itself, or pitiful and con - tracted. You are the advocate of the poor and needy, the distressed and destitute. It is for you to urge their claims, not only upon the Chapter, but on individual Brethren; and if you cannot per - suade, to shame into generous actions those, of whom there will always be some, who, penurious, and fond of cheap Masonry, forget that they have been taught that “God has only loaned them their wealth, and made them His Almoners to invest it.” Remember, especially, that there are many per - sons who have nothing left them but misery and modesty; and toward such we must add two cir - cumstances of charity: to inquire them out; and to convey our relief unto them so as we do not make them ashamed. When a Knight falls sick, you will visit him, and inquire into and provide for his wants; and when one dies, it is your duty to make proper provision for his burial. And, on this, and all other occas - ions that offer, remember, and remind also the Knights and Brethren, that Charity, with its twin - daughters, alms and forgiveness, is especially ef - fectual for the procuring God’s mercies in the day and manner of our death.

Answer: I do. 11 O.. Brother Secretary elect, I need not recite your duties or enlarge upon their importance. Brother Treasurer elect, as little need I recite your duties, or enlarge upon their importance. One thing only I do charge both of you to ob - serve.

No fanaticism actuated Clement the Fifth, or Philip the Fair of France ; but in that case, as often before and since, fear and greed affected a horror at impiety, united to crush a power that might become dangerous, silenced Free Thought and Opinion by assassination, and blackened the character of the victim to justify the murder. Face to the East, my Brethren! I.. O.. takes his station in the East, and says: Victims of the cruelty and craft of Spiritual power are legion. Among them was SOCRATES, the Athenian Philosopher, who in an age of gross superstition saw the Truth and taught it, and inspired his great disciple PLATO to write his immortal works, the most precious legacy of Heathen Antiquity. The Priests, who lived in luxury upon the popular sup - erstition, accused him of teaching his disciples to contemn the Gods; and he was sentenced to drink the fatal hemlock.

Perpetuate the names of other illustrious vic - tims of Tyranny; not only that you may be re - minded to execrate tyrants, but that you may learn to despise them. For Truth will conquer at the last. For him who is wiser than his time, the hem - lock is distilled, the axe bared, the gibbet erected, and theistake surrounded with flames.

Should the spirit of our doctrine ever be found in opposition to the letter of the written law, hesi - tate not to sacrifice everything to the inalienable rights of charity and justice, whatever may be the consequences! Whenever called on to act, remem - ber him who said, “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.” There is a word, my Brother, that was never heard in the sanctuaries of antiquity. It is the only word that enables man to comprehend the Deity, and it contains an entire revelation. This word is inadequately rendered by our English word “Charity,” and little less so by the word “LOVE.” Caritas is Affection and Loving-Kindness; and the manifestation in the world of the spirit of this Charity made God visible, as it were, upon the earth. Before Charity, Faith prostrates itself, and Science, vanquished, bows down. Here is evi - dently something greater than Humanity; Charity proves by its works that it is not a dream. It is stronger than all the passions: it trinmphs over suffering and death. It enables all hearts to com - prehend God, and seems already to fill eternity by the realization of its legitimate hopes. The Cross of the Passion, the Cross of Saint An - drew, the Cross of the Kadosh, are all to us sym - bols of Charity and Love, because upon it he who preached the Gospel of Love died for his brethren,— and yet the Cross has been to more than a million of armed men the Symbol of Persecution, the em - blem of a furious and persecuting zeal, though One who died npon it appealed to God to pardon his murderers, by the sublime cry, “Father, forgive them! for they know not what they do.” There is the whole code of Charity for feeble humanity in the prayer, as there is in the pardon of the woman taken in adultery: and both the sublime act and the sublime prayer are repudiated by the whole Christian world of men and women. It was the Spirit of Charity alone, exhibited in pardoning the malefactor in whose heart the feeling of pity and loving-kindness had not been wholly deadened by a life of vice, that entitled him who died because he loved his people, to cry unto God, “Father, to Thy hands I intrust my spirit.” WE DESERVE GOD’S MERCY IN PROPORTION TO OUR CHARITY. And finally, permit none to forget that Jesus said to the Samaritan woman: “Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father desireth such to worship Him.” Let the rival Rites in Masonry, and the rival and hostile Sects in religion, admit that these have"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"76 OFFICES OF INSTALLATION OF A COUNCIL OF KNIGHTS OF KADOSH 77 been, unto them, empty words!

So, if Power is just, may the au - thority of the Supreme Law in the State, and in - dividual liberty, co-exist in harmony.

My Brethren, it is necessary that every Mason should consider that, since God bath given him an excellent nature, wisdom, and the power to choose between good and evil, an understanding soul and an immortal spirit, He hath also ap - pointed for him a work and a service great enough to employ those abilities, and hath also designed him to a state of life after this, to which he can only arrive by that service and obedieffce. The service of the Holy House of the Temple is no sinecure, nor is the practice of Masonic duty a life of ease and indolent content, in which one, who sees all the evils and wrongs and villainies of the worjd swarming round him, can say, “Let 85 t 84"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"86 OFFICE5 OF IN5TALLATION OF A CONSI5TORY 87 alone !—it will last our day: after us the Deluge.” The Mason, were he but a simple Apprentice, must have the right “to put his trust in God ;“ and that right he cannot have, unless he so works and toils and suffers, as to deserve God’s favor and pro - tection. My Brethren, we entitle ourselves KADOSHIM, the Holy; and those who are appointed to minister in holy things, should know the worth of time, and how to be useful to arts or arms, to counsel in public, or to government in Masonry or their coun - try. They should not do the work of the Order negligently and idly, but in honoring God and do - ing His work put forth all their strength, and learn the burdens and necessities of their brethren, and strive to lighten one, and, in their proportion, supply the other. The progress and advancement of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite within your borders depends chiefly upon you and your successors. Out of the fitness to govern, alone, grows the right to govern: and whensoever this rule of God’s own ordaining is long disregarded, in Masonry or in the State, great calamities are about to befall the Commonwealth. All things of weight and import are to be done with due and grave solemnity, in evidence that we understand the importance of that matter which we have in hand. Solemn ceremonials are not empty pageants or vain shows. The coronations of Kings and the ordinations and inaugurations of Pontiffs require solemn and appropriate forms; and if any part of Freemasonry be real, and it be not all an idLe show and impertinent vain pretense, the ordinations of those who are to gover.n in it should be great solemnities and actions of religion.

The office which you have a~cepted imposes upon you very important duties. It cannot be necessary that I should recite them. In Masonry, as in every other State, Order and Commonwealth, the peace and harmony, the progress and prosperity of the whole, will in the greatest measure depend upon the ca - pacity and fidelity of those who govern. Moreover, in all voluntary societies, the many expect the few to labor while they look on; and to the few, this labor must often be its own reward. Knowing this, as you must know it, you accept the office and all its burdens; and it will be honorable to you, if its duties are faithfully performed. So only do office and honors go truly hand in hand. Expect to see your labors often unappreciated, and often, perhaps to find yourself toiling with little assistance, and even, as it may seem, in vain. Believing that you will not faint or weary in well-doing, I congratulate you upon your prefer - ment; and I do earnestly hope that you may so gov - em and preside, as that it shall be found to have been fortunate for this Consistory and for the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, that you were elected to the office with which you are now invested.

The efficiency of the Commander must always depend much upon that of his Lieu - tenants; and if they are incapable or unfaithful, indolent or lukewarm, his labors, besides being largely and unjustly increased, will to a great ex - tent prove unavailing. Often, indeed, more de - pends upon the subordinate than upon the Chief; and it is not rare, in war or statesmanship, for the latter to wear the laurels that in justice belong to the former. While you promptly obey your Chief, and faith - fully second his exertions, you are especially charged with the supervision of your columns. You have the right, possessed on more than one valid ground, to instruct, advise, guide and warn the Brethren, and, in cases of urgent necessity, to reprove and censure. If Masonic obligations had not unfortunately come to be so often unreal, no one would doubt that this brotherly prerogative belonged to the elected Chiefs of Masonry, who must, without it, often lament, without the power of remedying, evils and diseases entirely capable of cure.

Brother Chancellor, you are the Privy Councillor of the Master of the Kadosh. Through you, also, he issues his edicts and promulgates his decisions. You are to be the legal adviser of the Consistory, will draft its By-Laws, and see that they contain nothing contrary to the Statutes of the Supreme Council. The Master of the Kadosh may, on any matter or question which he or th~ Consistory is to decide, require your opinion; and through you the Consistory will promulgate its decisions and edicts. You will conduct its corre - spondence, and maintain its rights under the law, and defend and justify its action wherever the former may be in jeopardy or the latter impeached. It is, therefore, indispensable that you should be thoroughly familiar with the Constitutions, Institutes, Regulations, Statutes, Rituals and Formulas of the Order. You must be familiar, also, with the doctrine and philosophy of the An - cient and Accepted Scottish Rite. If, qualified by study and reflection, you should faithfully and effi - ciently perform all these duties, you will not only be entitled to the thanks and good opinion of your Brethren, but you will lay down the honors of office with the consciousness that, as they were conferred upon you without your solicitation, so they have been worn worthily and well. Brother Minister of State, you, as well as the Chancellor, are the Privy Councillor of the Master of the Kadosh. Upon all important questions de - OF A CONSISTORY 99 bated in the Consistory, it is your special duty to state your conclusions, before the matter is put to vote. It is your province to pronounce such dis - courses, to visitors of distinction, to Brethren newly received, to the Consistory on solemn occa - sions, and in honor of the dead, as may be required by the customs of the Order or directed by the competent authority. You should therefore study the Constitutions and Regulations, become familiar with the history of the Order, and thoroughly understand its phil - osophy. Not satisfied with knowing all that has been re-discovered as to the meaning of the sym - bols of Masonry, you should, by study and reflec - tion, endeavor to make new discoveries and bring to light the hidden meanings. I need not enlarge upon the necessity of diligence and of study. In no field of intellectual labor are they more necessary; in none can they be more richly rewarded. In no office is there more ample scope for intellect and learning than yours; and in no post could you be more useful to the Brethren. For it is when little instruction is given in the Lodges, when the same lessons and lectures are continually reiterated, and all the doctrine and learning of the Order are neglected, that their meetings become uninteresting, tiresome and un - profitable. The symbols of Masonry are not fixed dogmas, but images susceptible of indefinite interpreta - I V I,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"100 OFFICES OF INSTALLATION OF A CONSISTORY 101 tions. Masonry itself is not included in a certain routine and a few phrases of the catechism. Upon you it will in large measure depend whether it shall be, in this Consistory, anything more. Remember that he does the gravest injury to Masonry which it is in his power to do, who accepts a high and im - portant office, and neglects its duties. Brother Almoner, it will be your duty, not only to dispense the charities of the Consistory in ac - cordance with the ancient custom, but also to see - that all the Brethren conscientiously and punctu - ally perform all the duties of beneficence and of tender mercy, toward the sick, the suffering and the destitute. It will be your special duty to seek out and make known to the Consistory meritorious cases of want and distress, that they may be re - lieved. The most deserving cases of need and destitution are often those that seek concealment, and shrink from the light of day and suffer in silence. The world is very full of wretchedness and suffering, as it is of the selfish and the heart - less. To visit the homes of the wretched, to search for the sick and the destitute, and minister to them comfort and consolation, is that in which man most resembles God. To pour the balm of sympathy upon the bruised and wounded heart, to shelter from the inclemencies of fate the unfortunate, to encircle with supporting and merciful arms the feeble and the helpless; these belong to the mission and duties of Freemasonry. God allows suffering, destitution and misery to exist in the world, in part that they may give occasion for the exercise of that benefi~ence which is a portion of the divine nature that mingles with the human. Few men look upon distress and suffering, without emotions of sympathy and pity; but few are instant in seek - ing these out that they may relieve them. That which is the common duty of many, is too often neglected by all. Daily and hourly there are fear - ful agonies suffered, under the very eyes of those who are too busy to be merciful, which are known to God and the sufferers alone; and continually, from obscure hovels, and over-crowded tenements, and even from the highways and public landings, the wailing appeals of the neglected dying ascend to the Throne of the Almighty, Who doth not remit the punishment of neglect and inhumanity; but for these sends afflictions upon Cities and States. Upon you, my Brother, it will in great measure depend, whether the practice of the Brethren of this Consistory shall correspond with the large pro - fessions common to them and all Masons; or whether the consequences of neglect of duty, which are inevitable, shall sooner or later fall upon them. Brother Registrar, it will be your duty to keep the minutes and accurately record all the transac - tions of the Consistory; to receive and take charge of all papers and proceedings that are to be laid before it, and present them in due time; and upon"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"102 OFFICES OF INSTALLATION OF A CONSISTORY 103 proper application to make out and furnish ex - emplifications of the entries and records, and cause these to be authenticated by the Seal of the Consistory. You will also make out and transmit all returns and reports to the Supreme Council in due time and season; will receive all moneys for the Consistory, and pay them over to the Treas - urer. These, and the other duties of the Secre - tariat, if you well and faithfully perform, no officer will render more essential service than your - self; since there is no office in which neglect, delay or inaccuracy are more fatally injurious. You will find its duties laborious and monotonous; but your labors will find their reward in the approval and gratitude of the Brethren, and still more in the good fruit which they cannot but bear. Brother Treasurer, I need not recite your duties, neither need I remind you of the necessity of order, regularity and accuracy in your accounts. We always see great mischiefs, ill-feeling, discontents and impaired usefulness result from looseness and want of order and system in the financial affairs of Masonic Bodies. There is hardly a Mason who has not witnessed those evil consequences. It is especially in respect to fiscal affairs, that the be - ginnings of evil are to be avoided, the slight irreg - ularities and trivial relaxations of salutary rules which always lead at last to grave offenses of com - mission and omission.

Brother Preceptor of the Kadosh, with you is the bright Constellation composed of the two Stars, Justice and Equity, which to the Mason should ever be as inseparable as we are taught they are, as attributes of the Deity. I commit them to your special charge, and hope that enforc - ing them among the Brethren, you will ever regu - late by them your official and private conduct. Brother Prior of the Kadosh, with you is the bright Constellation composed of the three Stars, LIBERTY, EQUALI2TY and FRATERNITY. They will govern in this Consistory, as they do everywhere else in the Scottish Masonry: LIB - ERTY, with Constitutional Law; EQUALITY, with Order and Subordination; FRATERNITY, with Precedence of the best and wisest. I commit the three Lights to your charge. Never forget, nor ever fail to remind the Brethren, how sadly misunderstood and abused these three grand words have been, and how many crimes have been com - mitted in their name. And yet never forget that they contain a whole creed, when rightly under - stood, of which every Mason ought to be an Apostle. Brother Master of the Kadosh, with you is the great Constellation of the five Stars, FAITH, HOPE, CHARITY, TOLERATION and TRUTH. I commit them to your charge. Look well to them, my Brother, and let them never cease to burn in your Consistory; for if one of them should ever disappear, and be seen no more among you, Ma - sonry also will have departed, to seek some more congenial region. Brother Master of the Kadosh, Dignitaries, Officers and Brethren of the Consistory, in your midst, irradiating your columns, shines the Great Central Constellation, composed of the five Stars, KNOWLEDGE, WISDOM, STRENGTH, HAR - MONY and ZEAL. I intrust them to you all. Re - ceive them in charge and let their light never be obscured. Study and reflect, my Brethren, and so gain Knowledge, and, with Knowledge, Wisdom. Become strong, and possess your Strength in Wis - dom, and let the fruit thereof be Peace and Har - mony and the Beauty of good Works, the fruit and issue of Zeal according to Knowledge.

Upon the faithful and intelligent performance by you of these and other duties, must in a great measure depend the orderliness and accuracy of the labors of the Consistory, the impression made upon the Candidates by their reception, the pleas - ure and gratification of the Brethren in their work.

The Expert receives his orders from the Master of the Kadosh and Marshal of Ceremonies, and conveys them as he may be directed. He examines such visitors as it is found necessary to interrogate and prove, and also examines and, with the aid of the Assistant Expert, prepares all Candidates.
