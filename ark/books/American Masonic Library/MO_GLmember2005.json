Diana and I have been received graciously everywhere we have traveled, and I thank you for every courtesy shown. There may be times when we question why we should become a leader in this Fraternity. It only takes seeing one man’s life changed because of the brotherhood he has found, or one “thank you” note from someone helped through our Masonic Home of Missouri, or a few minutes watching the difference we make through our support of Masonic Youth to know why we give our time and energy to be leaders and supporters of Freemasonry. I have witnessed all of these things this year and they have given me renewed faith for the future of our great fraternity. As my year as Grand Master draws to a close, I can say with great confidence that Missouri Freemasonry is alive and well! Thank you to each brother who is working to make us stronger every day. Fraternally, Elmer E.

A great deal of t he information contained involves merely matters of common courtesy and etiquette and the same are delineated merely to serve as a reminder. OFFICIAL VISITS BY THE GRAND MASTER A. Invitations for Visits by the Grand Master & Grand Lodge Officers Each Grand Master will have a different schedule. Some Grand Masters are retired individuals who have greater flexibility in scheduling events; whereas, other Grand Masters continue to be employed and must accommodate the needs of their individual busi ness pursuits in addition to performing the duties of Grand Master. For these reasons, a written invitation should be submitted to the Grand Master with a copy being sent to the Grand Secretary, as much in advance of any event as is possible. Alternative dates for sc heduling such events should also be included in any such invitation whenever possible. Customs or practices of Lodges, Districts or oth er Bodies or Events will be taken into consideration; however, presence of the Grand Master depends strictly upon the ability of the Gran d Master to appropriately schedule to be in various places. Normally, the scheduling is performed based upon a first to request basis. Thus, the inclusion of alternative dates is recommended for all invitations. Just as the Grand Master attempts to be flexible with His s chedule, so also should be the Person or Entity making the invitation. 1. Addressing the Invitation The invitation should be addressed as follows: M. W. Brother _______________, Grand Master Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free and Accepted Mason of the State of Missouri The address should only be included on the invitation itself, as Masonic Protocol does not use the Title upon the envelope used for correspondence. Instead, the envelope should be addressed: Mr. or Dr. or Rev. or Esq. or some similar title appropriate to the individual currently serving as Grand Master. 2. Enclosures with the Invitation A copy of any proposed Agenda or Ceremonial Information should be enclosed with the Invitation. A map of the location for the event, written instructions for locating the event and the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of a contact person should be delineated. A return or response envelope, self-addressed and including postage upon the same should be included with the Invitation. Any special requests to be made of the Grand Master need to be delineated in the Invitation so that the Grand Master may prepare appropriately to address those matters. B. Visitations by the Grand Master & Grand Lodge Officers In most or many instances, the First Lady of Freemasonry of Missouri will accompany the Grand Master. Consequently, the Indi- vidual or Entity making the Invitation or that receives the visitation, should make inquiry whether the First Lady will be in a ttendance, and if so, then appropriate accommodations for the First Lady should be provided. The First Lady should be provided with an Es cort and be treated with every Masonic courtesy appropriate to Her Station. The same is true of the Ladies of any and all other Grand L odge Officers that attend. Reserved Parking near the door of the facility where the visitation will occur should be provided for the Grand Master and any additional Members of the Grand Master’s Party or Entourage in attendance. An Escort for the Grand Master should be provided t o guide the Grand Master to the proper location for the visitation and also, to guide the Grand Master to normal amenities such as the location of rest rooms and other similar facilities. When Past Grand Masters are in attendance at any function, then Each Past Grand Master should be offered the same courtesi es and amenities as the Grand Master. This Distinguished and August Body of Dedicated Masons have previously demonstrated their love of the Craft and their devotion and commitment to service and therefore, every Masonic Courtesy must be extended to Both the Past Gran d Master, and His Lady."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 The Grand Master and the Past Grand Masters are properly addressed as Most Worshipful Sir, or Most Worshipful Brother _________ . The Wife of the Grand Master is appropriately addressed as: First Lady _______; and Wives of Past Grand Masters and of the Gra nd Lodge Officers are appropriately addressed as: Lady ___________. C. Masonic Etiquette of Invitations If there is to be an event such as a Lodge Installation, Dedication or some related function whereby the meeting is to be presi ded over, then the Proper Masonic Etiquette is for the Sitting Grand Master to be requested to preside. It is improper Masonic Etiquette to request the Sitting Grand Master to serve in any subordinate capacity to another Mason. Only where the custom is for some particular P ast Grand Master to preside at such an event has been established, should the Sitting Grand Master be requested to serve as a subor dinate to him. The Grand Master then has the option to attend, or to decline, based upon His preference but may only properly subordinat e Himself to a Person Who has previously Presided as Grand Master. GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PERSONAL APPEARANCES The Grand Master should receive “Grand Honors” at all Masonic Functions. Past Grand Masters in attendance should be introduced collectively, prior to the Grand Master and collectively, they should receive “Grand Honors” at all Masonic Functions. Receiving Lines The Grand Master is the last one present in any receiving line. The Grand Lodge Officers in attendance are immediately before the Grand Master and Past Grand Masters immediately preceed the Grand Lodge Officers. Other dignitaries are then arranged in order of their respective Stations with Heads and Officers of Appendant and Adoptive Bodies immediately following any District Deputy Grand Masters, Regional Grand Lecturers and District Deputy Grand Lecturers. Receptions for Ladies At receptions or other functions where only Ladies are present, the Ladies of Grand Lodge Officers and Appendant and Adoptive Bodies follow the same Order of Preference and Introduction as for their spouses. Dr ess The type of dress appropriate to the occasion should be delineated in any correspondence requesting the appearance of the Grand Master or a Grand Lodge Officer. The Grand Master, or ranking Grand Lodge Officer to be attending after consultation with the Grand Master, reserve the right to determine the type of dress that will be worn by the Grand Lodge Officials in attendance. Typically, the Grand Master will be in a Tux, Business Suit or Sport Coat and dress pants with tie. Should Business Casual or anything else be suggested or recommended in the invitation, a definition of that type of dress, according to the author of the invitation and Lodge customs, should be included. For example, some Lodges meet in Bib Overalls, or other similar dress for specified occasions. The same should be delineated in any such invitation so that the Grand Master, and Grand Lodge Officers may plan and dress in accordance with expectations. Speaking Persons who will be speaking should be recognized in the Order that they are presented in a Reception Line. It is totally improper for anyone to speak, other than to offer a closing prayer, after the Grand Master. The Grand Master is always the last to speak at any function. It is hoped that these general guidelines of courtesy and decorum provide some assistance to the Craft when dealing with Grand Lodge Officers and the Officials of other Masonic Bodies."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"GRAND LODGE OFFICE 6033 MASONIC DRIVE, SUITE B COLUMBIA, MO 65202-6535 Ronald D.
