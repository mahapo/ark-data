PUBLISHER’S PREFACE SECOND VOLUME. This Second Volume is simply a continuatio~i of the First one. The magnitude of the work, (aggregating over One Thousand Pages,) rendered a division into two Volumes desirable. The Introduction, Historical Sketch and Preface found in the First Volume are for the entire Work. Attention is again called to the fact that the First Three Masonic Degrees, termed the “Blue Lodge De - grees,” are not given in this work, because those degree’~ are common to all the different Masonic Rites, and are very fully and accurately given in Freemasonry Illus - trated, as advertised in the back part of this Volume. The reader will however find the “Secret Work” of those degrees given in the last Chapter of this Volume.

From these fixed signs, the Rite passes to the Sun, Moon and the Planets, From these the Rite looks to the four elements or four components of man, etc., and from these it con - siders the spirit and matter, or infinite and finite of the Universe and of man. In the Rose Croix Degree, we have seen the son of masonry and heard the promise of universal peace and joy.

(c. 31, 27,) to Sun-worship by solemn cireurnam - bulation in a Masonic lodge; every act of idolatry, how - ever trisial or contemptible, is an expedient to un-God our globe, by getting rid of Christ. When the Eternal Father brought forth his Son into the world, and said: “Let all the Angels of God worship him;” (Hcl. 1, 6,) one angel refused, and became chief of the devils. And all “Gentile” or Christless wor~h ip is paid to that fallen ‘I aDgel, or to some o~ his legions, (1, Cor. 10:20.) To dispense with Christ, is to leave our ruined race with no means or mediator, by whom to reach God and Heaven. And the lodge dispenses with Christ, by dropping his name and person, to take in his enemics; Jews, pagans and others; or, by insulting him with false, spurious worships. When Aaron told Israel to worship Jehovah, by dancing naked around a calf, ( Ex. 32:18.) he at - tempted to add a heathen ritual to an orthodox creed: and three thousand men that day paid for their idolatry with their lives. The sins of men are numberless. Idola - try is the one parent of them all ; and lodge worship is idolatry. And, of all idolarty, the most daring and damning, is when sinners tmitate and copy the ap - g~roaches of God to men. And this is what is doDe in this 19th degree. The lodge master is “Thrice Puusant;” personating Christ, who has “all power.” The master is “seated on a throne arid holds a Sceptre,” with the blue canopy of the heavens over him. This is Christ’s rival, the usurp - ing “god of thi.s world.” The degree itself, says Mackey, (Note 197,) “is founded on the mysteries of the Apoca - lypse,” which is “the Revelation of Jesus Christ,” (Rev. 1, 1.) And his lodge members are “clothed iD white liDen robes,” like attending Angels; (Rev. 15:6.) ADd on the jewel is engraved “Alpha and Omega,” which is the title of Christ. And in opening, the WardeD says: “the Sun of Truth has risen.” “Christ is the Sun of ilighteousness.” And ‘The Truth and Life.” ADd, as in a preceding degree, the grim mockery of opening the seals and sounding the trumpets (p. 451,) was gone through with, so here follow the vials poured out, and the dwelling place of God, the New Jerusalem, comes down to men. And after these superla - tively impudent moekeries are gone through with, the candidate is made to kneel down and swear to conceal them from all but MasoDs of this degree; after which the candidate is solemnly anointed into the priesthood of Christ, who is “a priest forever after the order of Mel - ehizedek.” There is nothing more revoltingly blasphemous in the Mormon Endowment House, where Brigam Young used, as El Shaddai, to personate Al - mighty God! And when this horrible fanfaronade is gone through with, by men such as are found in ordina - ry Masonic lodges, the ~eretehed dupe is told that he is ‘henceforward entitled to wear the sublime title of Scottish Mason.’ It is noticeahle that in this blasphe - mous recitative, there are no aser~ptions of glory tr’ Christ. The ritual runs; (p. 22.) “salvation, Glory, 1-lonor and Power to the EterDal God and Infinite Father.”"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"86 ?HE PURPOSE TO INSPIRE AWE AND HORROR. MASONRY THE IMAGE OP THE ROMISH BEAST. 37 The Bible ascription is ;—“Every creature which is in Heaven and on the Earth; and under the Earth, aDd such as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying; blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, forever and ever.” While the book itself is “the Revelation of Jesus Christ;” this Ette mutilates it by leaving him o(it of such p”assages as the above and compliments him only with a half contemptuous allusion to him as “the Mas - ter of Nazareth ;“ and a wooden image of a lamb, lying on a book with seven seals; with a further allusion to him as “Ihe Word.” But the most extraordinary part of this 19th degree is its bold allusion to “the Beast and His image.” The candidate is being led twelve times around the lodge, he is jerked into a small dark room and seated on the floor; sitting there he hears a brother say: “All who will not worship the Beast with seven heads and ten horns, shall be slain ;“ all men, the high and low, the rich and the poor, freeman and slave shall receive upon their right hand, or on. their forehead his mark, ete., or they shall neither buy nor sell.” And a second brother takes up the strain and adds :—“Remorse shall torture them and they shajl ha’~e no rest who worship the beast and his image ;“ and here the matter is dropped. The purpos~ would seem to be to inspire awe and horror in the candidate, and leave his mind in abso - lute emptiness and confusion. Now the secret lodge system of which this Rite is the ruling part, is the image of the Romish beast, which was, and is the secret despotism of the world. That the seven-headed beast with his harlot rider is Rome, the book itself teaches, (Rev. 17, 18.) “The woman which thou sawest is that great city which ruleth over the Kings of the Earth.” There can be no mistaking thi~ No other city on earth ever claimed and exercised jurisdiction over Kings. Pagan Rome was the B’~’.st, and Popery the religious harlot rider. In this, without exception Protestant commentators agree. And the lodge net-work which now covers the Globe, differs from Rome in two particulars: It has neither fixed government, church or nationality like Rome: but lodges are made “by them that dwell on the Earth,” (Rev. 13, 14,) promiscuously; neither visible govern - ment nationality or church, yet controls business anu religion! 2nd.—It is flitting as a shadowy image; changing its shapes endlessly, but keeping its diabolical priest nature. And the beast and his image are one, murderous and false as their master and god Satan, who was “liar and murderer from the beginning and the father of it.” (Jno. 8, 44.) And the last we hear of them; Beast, False Prophet, Image and their wor - shipers, they are cast into a lake of Are burning with brimstone, (Rev. 19, 20.) And whoever comforts him - self in the fact that the fire and brimstone are not lit~. eral, will doubtless find the reality as fearful as its sym - bols. One would suppose that a scripture like this would be the last woven into a Masonic rite, by men supposed to be educated and attentive to their own interests. The only explanation which can be suggested is that these degrees are the work of semi-apostate priests, like those swept into Ihe E’reneh Revolution of 1789, manufactured at the Jesuits’ College of Clermont in 1754-8:—That they were 5eDt to this eouDtry in 1761 by an ex-Jew, ~iforin, whose religion was money, as the Rite of Per - fection :—that Morn appointed sixteen “Inspectors General” with himself, of whom thirteeD were Jews also.

It is difficult to determine whether stupidity, cunning, swindling or superstitioD predominates in this vile compound. And though one can understand how sorcerers and jugglers can deal with such trash; the minister of Christ, who has ever known the truth, and yet deals in it must sure - ly incur “wrath to the uttermost.” CHAPTER XXXV TWENTIETH DEGREE; GRAND MASTER OP ALL SYMBOLIC LODGES OR ASSOCIATE M’ASTER AD VITAM. f PAST MASTER] ALSO CALLED GRAND MASTER OF Wis. - DON. vm~us oi ADONIS. g DECORATIONS :—The hangings are blue and gold.

An investigation of the mysteries of Adonis pecniisri.y elsims the attention of the Masonic student: first. because. in their symbolism and in their esoteric doctrine, the religious object for which they were instituted, and the mode in which that ohject is attained, they bear a nearer ansiogical resemblance to lb. institution of Freemasonry than do any of the other mysteries or systems of initiation of the ancient world: and. aecondly. because tbeir ebief locality bringa them into a very ciose connection with the early history and repoled origin of Freemasonry. For they were principaily celebrated at iiybios. a eity of Phoenicia. whoa. scripiural name was Gebal. and uhoae inhahitjnts were the Giblites or Giblemites. who are referred to in the lam Brok of Kings (chap V. iS) as being the stone - aquarers employed by King Solomon In building the Temple. Hence there must have evidently been a very intimate ronnection. or at least certainly a very frequcut intercommunication, between the workmen of the first Temple and ihe inhabitants of Byblos. the seat of the Adonisiso mynteries. and the piace whence the worshipers of thot rite were disseminated oycr otber regions of country. These historical circuniateflfes invite na to an examination of the system of initiation ~hieh wns preetleed at Byhios. becau,e we may find in it something that was probably suggestive of the symbolie system of InstructioB which was subsequently so prominent a feature in the system of Freemasonry.. Let us first examine the myih on which the Adonisiac initiation was fonaded. The mytholo ical le end of Adonis is, that he was the son ef Myrrha and cinyrus. ¶~immg o~ cyprus.

My brother, as Grand Master of all Symbolic Lodgee, it is your especial duty to aid in restoring masonry to its primitive purity. You have become an instructor. Masonry long wandered’ in error. Instead of improving it degenerated from its primitive simplicity and re - trograded toward a system, distorted by stupidity and ignorance, which, unable to construct a beautiful ma - chine made a complicated one. Less than two hundred years ago its organization was simple and altogether moral; its emblems, allegories and ceremonies easy to be understood, and their person and object readily to be seen. It was then confined to a very small number of degrees. Innovators and inventors overturned that primitive simplicity. Ignorance engaged in the work of making degrees and trifles and gewgaws; and pretended myster - ier, absurd or hideous, usurped the place of masonic truth. The picture of a horrid vengeance,” 0 the poniard and the bloody head appeared in the peaceful temple of masonry without sufficient explanation of their sym - bolic meaning. Oathsu~i out of all proportion with their object shocked the candidate and then became ri - diculous, and were wholly disregarded. The rituals, even of the respectable degrees, copied and mutilated by ignorant men, became nonsensical and trivial, and the words so corrupted that it has hithCrtO becn found impossible to recover many of them at all. Candidates were made to degrade themselves and to submit to insults not tolerable to a man of spirit and honor. Hence it was that practically the largCst portion of the degrees claimed by the Ancient and Ac - cepted Rite, and the Rites of Perfcction and Nfisraim fell into disuse, were merely communicated, and their rituals became jejune and insignificant.

Hence the Prussian Knights cull ibemasivis Noechites. or DiscIples of Noah, sahile they designate all other Masons as Hiramites. or Disciples of Hiram. The early French rituals state that the degree was transiated in 1757 from the German by. M de Bersic Knight of Eloqueiice in the Lodge of the Count 5t, Gelaire. lnspirti,r General of Prussian Lodges in i’ranee Lenning gives no credli to this statement. hat admits that the origin of the degree must he 5ttribnti.~i to the year above named. The destruction of the tower of Babel consti - tutes the legend of the degree, whose mythical founder Is said to havc been Peleg, Ito chief builder of that edifice. A singular regulatIon is that theic shail he no artificisi light In the Lodge room, and that lii meetings shaii he held on the night of the full moon of each month. The degree was adopted by the Council of Emperors of the East and west. and in that way became autiacqucoily a part of the s3stem of tue Scottish Rite. flut it is misplaced in any series of degrees supposed t” emanate from ihe Solomonic Tcmpie It is. so an unditing link. aii unsightly interruption of the chain of lcgcn,lary symbolism substituting Noah for Solomon. and Peleg for Hiram Ahiff The Supreme Counell for the Southcr,i JurisdIction has abondoned the original rItual and made the degree a representation of the vebmgerieht or westphailan Franc Judges But this by no means relieves the degree of the objeetion of Masonic incompatibliity.

My brother, we read that the descendants of Noah resolved to build a tower so high as to prevent the Almighty from again destroying the world by a flood and to get themselves a name in the world. They chose for their purpose the plains of Shinar, in Asia. Ten years after the foundation was laid, the Lord looking down upon earth and beholding the pride and audacious attempt of the people, He descended to confound their project by causing a confusion of languages among the workmen so that they could not understand one another; whence it was called Babel. Sometime after, Niznrod’” established a distinction among men, and founded a city, and called it Babylon. Tradition says, the dedica - tion was at the full of the moon so the festivals of this degree are held in the month of March, at the full of the moon. Tradition further informs us that after the lan - guages were confounded at the building of the tower of Babel, the workmen separated and dispersed into differ - ent countries. The architect of the tower traveled into Germany where he arrived after a long and tedious journey, living upon roots and other vegetables. He Note 358.—”Nimrod. The legend or the Craft in the Old Constltntlons eaters to Nimrod as one of the founders of Masonry. Thus in the York ManuscrIpt we read: ‘At ye making of ye Toure of Bahell then was Ussonrie first much esteemed of. and the King of Dahilon yt was called Nlmrod was A mason himielfe and loved well Masons. • And the Cooke Manuscript th.’a repeats the story ‘And this same Nembroth began the tower of bablian and he taught to his werkemen the craft of Masonele. and he had with him many Masons more than forty thousand And he loved and cherished them well.’ The idea no douht sprang out of the ficriplural teaching that Nimrod was the srchitect of many cltiea a statement not so well expressed In the authorized versIon. as It is In the Improved one of Bochart. which says: Trom that land Nlmnod went forth to Asahur. and huilded Nineech. and itehoboth city, and Caish. and Ibsen between Niheich and Gush. thai Is the great city?”— aekats Zneyoipsadla of 2raemsaoaa7, Artiela Nisored."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"80 NOACHITE OR PRUSSIAN KNIGHT. fixed his residence in that part now called Prussia, where he erected a dwelling to shclter himself from the in - clemency of the weather, and where he also erccted many monuments. In Lhe ycaf 1553, in digging for salt mines, ~the work~ men found thc ruins of a triangular edifice 15 cubit.s deep. In the ccntrc of this edifice they found many trophies of antiquity: An urn of agate, and many mar - ble columns ~vxth hierogi) phicb engraven thereon. The origin of this ordcr, my brother, wa~ long before the era of Hiram or Solomonian Masonry; as every one knows that the to~’er of Babel ~va~ built long before the temple of Solomon, and in former txmcs it was not necessary that a candidate should be a MasLer Mason to be qualified to reccive this; for in the times of the e’u - sade~ the Knights of the different ordcrs in Europe were initiatcd into this degree by the Christian Priiiecs to conquer the Holy Land which was invaded by the Infi - dels, as were also the masons descendant from Hiram. You are especially charged in this degree, to be mod - est and humble, and not ~vain-g1orious nor fihlcd with ~e1f-conceit. Be not ~viser in your own opinion than the Deity, nor find ~fau1t with his works, nor ~udeavor to improve upon ~~‘liat he iia~ done. Be modest ail~o in ~‘our intcreourse ~~‘it1i your fellows, and slow to entertain ev~1 thoughts of them, and rehic— tant to a~(ribe to them evil intentions. ~Vhen a mason hears of any man who hath fallcn into public disgrace, he should have a mind to commiserate his mishap and not to iiiake him more disconsolate. To envenom a name by lihels that aircady is openly tainted is to add stripes with an iron rod to one that is flayed with whipping, and to every well tempered mind will seem most inhuman and diabolical. Even the man who does wrong and commits errors, often has a quiet home, a fireside of his own, a gentle loving wife, and innocent children who, perhaps do not know of hi8 past errors and lapses, past and long repented of, or if they do, do love him the better, because being mortal, he bath erred, and being in the image of God, he hath repcntcd. That every blow at this husband and father, strikes full upon the pure and tender bosoms of the wife and those daughLers is a consideration that doth not concern ~r stay the hand of the base and brutal informer. My brother, if men weighed the imperfections of humanity, they would breathe less condemnation. Ig - flora nce gives disparagemcnt a louder tongue than knowl - edge does; wise men had rather know than tc]1. If WE. even do know viecs in men we can scarce show our~eivc~ in a nobler virtue than in the charity of conecaling thorn. if that be not a flattery, persuading to continuance and it is the basest office man can fall into, to make his tongue the defamer of the worthy man. There iB but one rule for a mason in this matter: If there bc virtues, and he is called upon to speak of him who knows them, let him tell them forth impartially, and if there be vices mixed with them let him be content the world ~haII know them by some othcr tongue than his; for if the evil doer deserves no pity, his wife, his parents or his children, or other innocent persons who love him, may. Where we want experience, charity bids us think the best and leave what we know not to the searcher of hearts. For mistakes, ~uspicion~ and envy often injure a clear fame; and there is leaRt danger in a charitable"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"K 82 NOACHITE OR PRUSSIAN KNIGHT. construction. And finally the mason should be humble and honest and modest toward the Great Architect of the Universe, and not impt~gn his wisdom nor set up his own imper - fect sense of right against His providence and ‘dispensa± tions, nor attempt too rashly to explore the mysteries of God’s infinite essence and inscrutable plans and of that great nature which we are not made capable to understand. Let him not spend his time in building a new tower of Babel; in attempting to change that which is fixed by an inflexible law of God’s enactment, but let him, yield - ing to the Superior Wisdom of Providence, be content to believe that the march of events is rightly ordered by an infinite wisdom, and leads, though we cannot see it, to a great and perfect result. Let him my brother be satisfied to follow the path pointed out by that providence, and to labor for the good of the human race in that mode in which God has chosen to enact that that good shall be effected. And above all, let him build no tower of Babel under the belief that, by ascend~ng he will mount so high that God will disappear, or be superseded by a great monstrous aggregation of material forces, or a mere glittering logi - cal formula; but evermore standing humbly and rever - ently upon the Earth, and looking with awe and confi - dence toward Heaven, let him be satisfied that there is a real God, a person and not a formula, a father and a proteclor, who loves and sympathizes and compassion - ~ites; and that the eternal ways by which lie rules the world are infinitely wise no matter how far they may be ahove the feeble comprehension and limited vision of man.

My brother, sympathy for the great laboring classes, respect for labor it~clf and resolution to some good work in our day and generation, these are the lessons of this degree, and they are purely masonic. Masonry has made a working man and his associates the heroes of her principal legend and herself the com - panion of Kings. The idea is as simple and true as it is sublime; from first and last masonry is work. It venerates the Great Architect of the Universe. It com - memorates the building of a temple. Its principal em - blems are the working tools of masons and artisans. It preserves the name of the first worker in brass and iron as one of its pass-words. The master is the over - seer who sets the craft to work and gives them proper instructions. Masonry is the apotheosis of work. It is the bands of brave, forgotten men that have made this great popu - Ions, cultivated world a world for us. It is all work and forgotten work. The real conquerers, creators and eternal proprietors of every great and civilized land are all the heroic souls that ever were in it, each in his degree. All men that ever felled a forest tree or drained a marsh, or contrived a wise scheme, or did or said a true or valiant tIling therein. Genuine work alone, done faithfully, that is eternal, even as the Almighty founder and world-builder himself. All work is noble. A life of ease is not for any man, nor for any God. The Almighty Maker is not like one who in old, immemorial ages, having made his machine of a universe, sits ever since and sees it go. Man’s highest destiny is not to be happy, to love pleasant things and find them. His only true unhappiness should be that he cannot work and get his destiny as a man fulfilled. The day passes swiftly over and the night cometh wherein no man can work. That night once come, our happiness and unhappiness are vanished and become as things that"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"96 PRINCE OF LIBANUB. INITIATION. 97 never were. But our work is not abolished and has not vanished. It remains, or the want of it remains for endless times and eternities. It is in our influences after death that we are immortal. Labor is the truest emblem of God, the Architect and Eternal. Maker; noble labor which is yet to be the King of this Earth, and sit on the highest throne. Men without duties to do arc like trees planted on precipices from the roots of which all thc earth has crumbled. Nature owns no man who is not also a martyr. She scorns the man who sits screcned from all work, from want, danger, hardship, the victory over which is work, and has all this work and bottling done by other men. And yet there are men ~~lio pride themselves that they and theirs have done no work, tinic out of mind. The chief of men is he who stands in the van of men, fronting the peril which frightens back all others, and if not vanqnishmcd would devour them. hercules was worshipped for twelve labors. The Czar of Russia became a toiling slmipwright and worked with his a~e in the docks of Snard~m, and something caine of that. Cromwell i~orked, and Napoleon and effected somewhat., There is perennial nobleness and even sacredness in work. Be he never so benighted and forgetful of his high calling, there is always hope in a man that actually and earnestly works. In idleness alone is their perpetual despair. ~fan perfects himself by working. Jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fleld~ rise instead, and stately cities, and withal, the man him - self first ceases to be a foul unwholesome jungle and desert thereby. Even in the meanest sort of labor the whole soul of man is composed into a kind of real har - mony the moment he begins In work. Labor is life; from the inmost heart of the worker rises his God-given force, the sacred celestial life-essence breathed into him by Almighty God and awakens him to all nobleness as soon as work fitly begins. By it, man learns patience, courage, perseverance, openness to light, readiness to own himself mistaken, resolution to do better and improve. Only by labor will man continually learn the virtues. Let him who toils complain not, nor feel humiliated. Let him look up and see his fellow workmen there in God’s Eternity; they alone surviving there. Even in the weak human memory they long survive, as saints, as heroes, and as gods they alone survive, and people the unmeasured solitudes of time. It was well to give the earth to man as a dark mass, whereon to labor. It was well to provide rude and unsightly materials in tIme ore bed and the forests for him to fashion into splendor and beauty. It was well, not because of that splendor and beauty, but because the act creating them is better than the things themselves. Because exertion is nobler than en - joyment, because the laborer is greater and more worthy of honor than the idler, masonry stands up for the nobility of labor. It is Heaven’s great ordinance for human improvement. It has been broken down for ages and masonry desires to build it up again. It has been broken down because men toiled only because they must, submitting to it as in some sort, a degrading necessity and desiring nothing so much on earth as to escape from it. They fulfill the great law of labor in the letter; but break it in the spirit, they fulfill it with the muscles, but break it with the mind. Masonry teaches that every idler ought to hasten to some field of labor, manual or mental, as a chosen and coveted theater of improvement, but he is not impelled"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"98 PBINC~ or L1~ANUS.

It is time that this opprobrium of toil were done awaly. To be ashamed of tbil, of the dingy wbrkshop and ilusty labors field, of the hard hand, stained with service more honor - able than that of war; of the soiled and weather-stained garments on which mother nature has stamped, midst sun and rain, midst fire and steam, her own heraldic honors; to be ashamed of these tokens and titles, and envious of the flaunting robes of imbecile idleness and vanity is treason to nature, impiety to Heaven, a breach of heaven’s great ordinance. Toil of brain, heart or hand is the only true manhood and genuine nobility. Labor is man’s great function, his peculiar distinction and his privilege. From being an animal that ears and drinks only, to become a worker, and with the hand of ingenuity to pour his own thoughts into the moulds of nature, fashioning them into forms of grace and fabrics of convenience and converting them to purposes of im - provement and happiness, i~ the greatest possible step in privilege. & What is there glorious in the world that is not the product of labor? What is history but its record? What are the treasuries of genius and art but its work? What are cultivated fields but its toils? The busy marts, the rising cities, the enriched empires of the world are but the great treasure-houses of labour. The pyramids of Egypt, the castles, and towers and temples of Europe, the buried cities of Italy and Mexico, the canals and railroads of Christendom arc but tracks all round the world of the mighty footsteps of labor. Without it antiquity would not have been; without it there would be no memory of the past and no hope for the future. Even utter indolence reposes on treasures that labor at some time gained and gathered. He who does nothing, and yet does not starve, has still his significance, for he is a standing proof that somebody has at same time worked. But not to such does masonry do honor. It honors the worker, the toil - er, him who produces and not alone consumes, him who puts forth his hand to add to the treasury of human comforts and not alone to take away. It honors him who goes forth amid the struggling elements to fight his battle and who shrinks not, with cowardly effeminacy, behind pillows of ease. It honors the strong muscle and the manly nerve, and the resolute and brave heart, the sweating brow, and toiling brain. It honors the great and beautiful offices of humanity, manhood’s toil and woman’s task, fraternal industry and maternal watching and weariness, wisdom teaching and patience learning; the brow of care that prc~dcs over the state and many handed labor that toils in workshop, field and study, beneath its mild and beneficent sway. To aid in securing to all laior, permanent employ - ment and its just reward; to help to hasten the coming of that time when no one shall suffer from hunger or destitution, because, though willing and able to work, he can find no employment, or because lie has been over - taken by sickness in the midst of his labor is one part of your duties as a Knight of the Royal Axe, and if we can succeed in making some small nook of God’s creation more fruitful and cheerful, a. little better and more ~vorthv of him, or in making some one or two human heirts a little ~vi~er, more manly, hopeful and happy, we shall have done work worthy of masons, and accepta - ble to our Father in Ileaven."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CLOSING CEREMONIES KNIGHT OF THE ROYAL AXE OR PUNcE or LIDANU&.

But remember and ‘read over and again, (Note 21(1 Mnekev’s authoritetive declaration that the “object and ?n,s - .sion” of the whole thing is the worship of the Grand Archttcef of the U’urcrse: a religion whose God is the devil, “the God of this isorld.” t~ho is pronounced by Christ “tz liar from the be’ ginnulg, and thc father of it.” Tu’ENTY-FIRST DEGREE; NOACISITE OR PRuSsIAN KXI GIlT. “The history as well as eh~aracter of this degree i~ a very singular one.” (Mackey in Note 245.) Languagc needs stronger ~t’ords than “Puerile” and “contenipti - bl&’ to cliaracteriz~ It. Masons themselves despise it. Mackey says, in the above note, “that it was ever admit - teil into the Masonic s’stem is only attn biit~ible to the passion for high degrees which prevailed in Franee.” * * “This degree was adopted into ihe Rite of Mis - raim, where it is the thirty-fifth.” Which Rite of Misraim Bedarride (Note 236,) quoted approvingly by Mccoy, says :—“is full of puerili’t ice,” and even Mackey, with every earthly motive to praise it, says: “It is not absolutely puerile.” (Note 246.) Whoever runs his etc over its ritual and the notes w’ill see that its name is derived from Noah, and its substance from the tower of Babel, ages later. It was said to be dug up out of salt mines, A. U. 1553; and the early French writers admit that it originated in I Th7. (Note £45.) Ca.rlyle, whose great popularity rested largely on his known and wonderful fidelity to fact, says that Frederick the Great of Prussia, from ithoin the degree is called “Prussian Knight,” while Crown Prince was in a lodge a year or two, and “soen left off alto - gether,” and that his picture alone ever presided in a lodge. (Note £47.) But Frederick, and Voltaire, who lived at his court, hated the Bible, and the only con - ceivable motive for writing such a degree, was to make the Bible history contemptible, by its twaddling legend of the Tower of Babel and the travels of Peley. which so Dearly resemble the travels of Nephi in the Book of Mormon. But if we constantly recur to the authentic utterance of Dr. Mackey, that “the mission aiid objeeL of Masonry is the worship of the Great Architect of the Universe,” or “God of this world,” and then consider for a moment the nature of the worships now paid to him around our globe; we shall see that the endleris “puerilities” of those worships, so far from being an objection, are a double advantage and help to the end sought. The frivolity of Masonry keeps sensible but uninformed men from fearing it, and brings thousands under its devilish magnetism, who think it must be a harmless thing, and so venture into it for worldly advantage; while others believe in its mysterious power because its legends and forms are contemptible! The mightiest powers on earth to manage mind, are in the contemptible “puerilities” of the mass, the pagoda and the lodge. How insane then the talk of the little secrecy of temperance lodges.

In this and the two following degrees, we are taken back to the Old Testament, where Ramsay, Jesuits, and Jews were at home; and the stupendous realities and truth of God redeemed the Rite from contempt and dis - gust, even though used as Simon the sorcerer wished to use the Holy Ghost, for gain. For there is sublimity in the name and works of God, even when used in blas - phoiny and sacrilege. Nadab and Abihu fall dead by the fiery eye flash of God, while using God’s instituted worship, as these Masons use his word for worldly ad - vantage, and we see here acted over what impressed us so solemnly in our childhood when we read and saw pictured in the old “New England Primer” “Proud Itoraha troop” “was swallowed up.” And we can endure the home made earth-quakes and manufactured thunder of this degree, for the sake of some glintings of Bible history, which show the fearful doom which awaits all impudent cozeners with the word and worship of God. The reader need only glance at the Ritual and Notes to get the whole drift of the degree, which, on page 116, lands us in the pagan worship of the heavenly bodies by the “branch candle - stick which is God’s symbol of a church of Christ. (Rev. 1, £0.) But let us glance at the philosophy of this degree. A priest, which word first meant an aged and yen- usbie man, or father, came to be the man who was a day’s man or intercessor between the family or tribe and God. When our race had run down so that “the earth was filled with violence,” like the South beLor.~ our slavery war, and had become so corrupt that a Universal Deluge did not cleanse it; then God in8ti- tuted a pictorial and pantomime worship suited to the ignorance of grown-up babes, with the strength and passions of men. But sin and corruption was not all that kept men from God. God was infinite and men infinitesimal. The blind worm beneath the sod knows as much of the solar system, and the infinity beyond as a finite sinner knows of the Infinite God. “Touching the Almighty we cannot find him out,” (Job, 37, 23,) is literal verity. But Christ was and is “God manifest” to man, or “more humano.” He “spake,” and the worlds came. He “spake” to Adam and Eve. Without ceasing to be God, he became man, our Prophet, Priest, and King: and we know, and can know of God, only what we are taught by Christ. And as sin is certain ruin and law has no mercy in itself, however “holy, and just and good ;“ Christ, being the same yesterday, to-day and forever ;“ “Eternity, past, present and to come,” he could and did become our Wisdam, Righteousness, Sandi~cat ion and Redemption. Hew itin came we know not; God if He will may explain that to us in Eternity. But we very well know there is sin. And the Bible being true, (and if it is not, Masons insult us by quoting it,) we know there are devils, and their chief is Christ’s adversary, rival and antagonist. And he is as Christ called him the usurping “Prince of this world”: and the God of its false worships. And God gave by Moses, a law which any one can see is per - fect; because that supreme love to God and equal love to man would and will perfect our globe, is just as"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"120 SXTAN BOTh INIIrATEM AND IiE~ISTS CHRIST. plain as that two halves of an apple make the whole of it. And He gave by Moses, not only a peFfect law, but ~t pertect Gospel in every lamb on their altars. And ho gave a human priesthood to apply that law, and ex - plain that Gospel. And every one of those priests was a fingerpost pbmnting to Christ. And when they be - came corrupt, Christ Himself came in pcrson. And when we crucified him, He sent “another Comforter,” a s’vect an(l Holy Presence or Spirit, whom we could not, can not kill; and the chart of the world shows ~hat that holy Spirit has done, and is doing among the, nations. N’~w this devil has followed, copied, imitated and re - sisted Christ, from Eden until now ! He tvas a 5cr— pent in Eden and he has crawled after Christ ever since, aping and imitating his methods. He turned rods to serpents in Egypt. He has inspired prophets, sometimes hundreds to Christ’s one! And since He is now come, and “hath an unchanging priesthood,” we need no priest but Him, since He is ready to come at call, and the holy Spirit will show him to us. So since Christ there are no priests but usurpers. Every Masonic priest is a devil’s eoanterfcit. When Christ began to exercise divine power here, thie devil met him and claimed through ibm the ~iorld’s worship. rrhat lie has been at ever since, and Freemasonry and its spav.n are the last hope of the devil. He shifts his forms, he hides under aliases and changes the fashions o~ his worships. And as Mackey says: “The mission and object of Masonry is “worship,” and it is not the worship of Christ. The “Gentiles” (nations without Christ) all worship devils. (1 Car. 10, 20.) The is - ~iie is now joined, and when Christianity throws off the ~~‘orship of Satan the Gospel will subdue the world, “~ttending Angels abnnt for joy: tud the bright nrrn,,’, niog ‘‘Mortals. heboid the sn,eod seal •‘~)f your desccndli~g iOng.

Zodiacal Signs a Heathen Invention—Masonic Baptaim a Heathen Rite— Freemasonry Simple Heathenlam—governed by the Terrors of a Secret Proofs afforded by this degree that Freemasonry u vulgar, debased heathenism: Proof First. Its oath (which makes the Mason) is sworn on the “Holy Book of the Law,~ which, Mackey says, “Masonically,” means the Sacred Book of any and every religion on earth. (See Note 273.) This .jn - eludes not only the Books of Curious Arts (Acts 19, 19) and the “Book of Mormon,” which sanctions polygamy and despotism, but the Gree Gree-Ritual, sworn upon in African lodges, which practice whoredom, human sacrifice and cannibalism. Proof Second. The second apartment of the lodge- room of this degree is surrounded with twelve pillars, on which are painted the twelve signs of the Zodiac, with an officer stationed between two signs; as Moses bc - tween Taurus and Aries; the Bull and the Ralli, and so on. And these signs, used in consecrating a priect of all the religions of the world, have a religious, nct an astronomical, significance. These signs were in - vented by Egyptian priests who practiced brute-worship and brutalized Egypt till it became, as the Bible pre - dicted: “the basest of the kingdoms” (Ezek. 29, 15), as it is at this day. The Egyptians worshiped the ani -"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"142 MASONIC BAI’TTSM A HEATHEN RITh. FREEMASONRY SIMPLE HEATHENIsM. 143 mals whose names they gave to the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and transferred them to the heavens, and wor - ~.liipped them still. McClenachan’s book of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, page 558, says: “This rite (Baptism) has come to us by legitimate itransinis - sion * * * in the simple sense in which it was used in the land watered by the Nile, before the build - ing of the Pyramids.” And “The Ceremony of Bap - tism” occupies twenty-one pages in this “Book of the Rite.” If this does not identify Masonic baptism with the religion of Egyptian brute-worship, language has no meaning. Proof Third. Commenting on The Three Lights, (Ritual, p. 129, Note 276) Mackey says: “The sun has three names, and the moon three also. And in all incantations, three was a favorite number.” Incanta - tion was raising devils by magic. And seeking knowl - edge and power from’ devils is worshiping them. If Dr. Mackey intended to identify Masonry with sun, moon and demon worship, the above is the language he would use. Proof Fourth. Macoy (Note 279) .gives Christ’s appellations: “Morning Star,” “Rising Sun,” “Day Star,” etc., to Satan, the God of all Gentile or heathen worships: under the title of the G. A. 0. T. U., who is neither Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost, but the “prince,” and “god of this world.” Proof Fifth. And Mackey, the lexicographer, and jurisconsult of Masonry, eicpressly declares it to be mag - ical or heathen worship, thus: “In the high degrees of Masonry, as in the ancient institutions, there is a purification by fire coming down to us insensibly and unconsciously from the old Magian eultus.” (Note 282.) “Oultus” is the Latin for worship. These proofs might be extended indefinitely. And if they do not establish, by Masonic authorities, that Freemasonry I is “vulgar, debased heathenism,” then Egyptian brute- worship, sun and moon-worship, fire-worship and all the rest, are not heathenism. To call it “philosophy” is to insult civilization, reason and religion. The uniform, universal declaration of Masonic writ - ers that “Masonry is t~&e religion in which all mankind agree,” and that dictum of Dr. Mackey, that “The mss - awn and object of Masonry i. the worship of the Great Architect ,“ etc., who is neither FATHER, SON nor HOLY GHOST, settles it: if authority can settle anything; that Freemasonry is simple heathenism. And “A heathen man,” by Christ’s word, was to be an outcast from the church (Matt. 18, 17), and reason, observation and e~omnuon sense affirm the same. ~ence this twenty-fourth degree employs the names of the men of God, and the terms of the Bible, to conse - crate priests for the devil! And as there are no human priests since Christ, “who hath an unchangeable priest. hood” (Heb. 7, £4), to make a priest of any one religion, is to make a counterfeit. But this degree makes a universal priest! A priest of all the religions on earth And if this degree has done its full work in him, his heart contains all the priestly depravity from Cain in Eden to the Mormon at Salt Lake. And history as well as theory proves it. And when Aaron Burr brow - beat into a duel and shot the friend of Washington; and Benedict Arnold burnt and pillaged towns and villages which, as an American officer, he had sworn to protect with his own life, they both showed what moral monsters Masonry can make of men. And the sole reason why the Episcopalian, Baptist and Methodist clergymen of Chicago who are high Masons, sworn full of oaths~ are not Burrs and A molds in religion, is, that they do not understand the system to which they belong,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"144 GOVERNED BY THE TERRORS OF A SECRET CLAN. and are held back by the influence of surrounding Christianity.

In discussing these degrees, why use harshness and severity? The wisdom from above is “pure,” “peace - able,” “gentle,” “full of mercy.” Paul himself was “genthe,” as a nurse among children. And Moses, but especially Christ, was “meek.” Ans.: In dealing with teachiers of false religion, and corrupters of the true, the severity of Christ, the prophets and apostles knew no bounds but the limits of language. Thus Peter: “Thy money perish with thee I” Paul: “Thou ehihd of the devil !“ John: “Serpents, and the seed of ser - pents !“ Christ uttered~ the ~same words. And Moses, who was ruler and law-giver, as well as teacher, said of a dealer in “wond~rs” and false mysteries: Thiough thine own brother, son, daughter or “wife of thy bosom,” whoever should entice into msn-made religious rites, like this Scottish Rite: “thou shalt surely k11 him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death; and, afterwards, the hand of all the peophe.” (Deut. 13, 1-9.) And though in warring against demon-worships, the Christians’ weapons are “not car - nal, but spiritual,” the treatment of sorcerers by Paul and Peter, and the fate of Ananias and Sapphira, show what estimate God puts on Ramsay and his Jesuits, Morin and his Jews. and their abettors, who framed ~jg~ 330 degree rite, for money and worldly advantage. A high Masonic authority says: “If history speaks cor - rectly, Morin and his coadjutors found the manufactur - ing of Masonic degrees and the sale of Masonic dignities a very profifable and lucrative undertaking. They pur - sued it diligently, making all the money they could from the traffic.” (Folger’s Ancie’nt and Accepted Scott i.gh Rite, p. 88.) This is high Masonic testimony concerning the founding of this Rite, which now rules the Masonic world. And there is nothing like it in the catalogue of human crimes and sins. The guilt of wreckers and sea-thieves who hold out false lights to lure ships on rocks, to drown passengers in order to get their goods, is slight, compared with that of the invent - ors and sellers of these Masonic degrees. Christ is come a light into the world. And here are thirty-three false lights hung out along the whole coast of Christen - dom, by men whose fathers sold Christ for thirty pieces of silver, to lure men on the “slippery rocks” of perdi - tion. Let none say this is exaggeration. Dr. Mackey, in his “Ritualist,” the authoritative liturgy of the lodges, says that the Entered Apprentice is “seeking the new birth, and asking that light which restores fallen man to his Maker ;“ which light, he says, “the lodge alone can give I” And he refers to the same thing in Note £89 of this degree. “A Mason always travels from west to east in search of light.” “The shock of entrance is the symbol of ‘The New Birth,’” which, he says, the Apprentice “appears before our portals seeking.” Every time the blinder falls, which is thirty-three times in these degrees, this same thing i3 repeated. The blinded and bewildered candidate is brought to the “light,” discovers the “word,” etc., both which are Satan, as an"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"160 “SATAN’S “Ignes Fatui, TO SWAMP MEN ETERNALLY” QUOTES THE RuLE AS SATAN DID TO DECEIVE MEN. 161 angel of light, personifying or symbolizing Christ, who only is the true “Light” and the true “Word,” who “was with God and who was God.” (John 1, 1.) And we do not slander the framers of these 33 degrees in saying they made thbrn for money. Folger is good Masonic’ authority, and he says tt. See his book of this rite, p. 38, already cited. Were these Jews framing degrees to bring men to Christ? No! A thousand times No! Then these degrees are Satan’s ignes fatui, to swamp men eternally in hell. And it is of such false worship - ers of whom the Psalmist says: “Surely thou didst set them in slippery places.” (Ps. 73, 18.) And these de - grees are those places into which these false coast lights are drawing life’s voyagers. The only escape from this dire conclusion is to suppose that the Holy Ghost goes into the lodges, as Dr. Oliver supposed, and takes the names of Christ which the ritual uses, and converts men to Christ. But whoever heard of a Christian revival in a lodge? Or of village lodges joining in a village revival? No: Voltaire, who was a Mason, did not lead prayer-meetings, nor do lodge-masters love and worship Christ. This very twent~r-fifth degree, which makes “Knights of the Brazen Serpent,” the lodge uses for purposes of idolatry, as the children of Israel did, who burnt in - cense to it (£ Kings 18, 4), and which Hezekiab de - stroyed. Read on page 157 the finishing touches, when this “Knight of the Brazen Serpent” is made. Nine strokes; five slow, three hurried, and one by itself, are struck with mallets. Nine steps are taken like the waving motions of a snake, and the pass-word given him is I. N. R. 1.. which are the initials in Latin of: Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, and this, ages before there was any Latin tongue. And he who cannot see in this conjuring, every mark and feature of devil- worship, has already been blinded by idolatry. But why do these degree-makers, grade after grade, follow and employ the Sacred Scriptures? The answer is: for the same purpose for which the Book of Mormon does the same thing. That foul imposition contains whiohe chapters of the Bible; sometimes quoted literally and sometimes as in these degrees, mixed with Mormon gibberish. They quote the Bible as Satan did to Christ, to deceive men. They quote it while they hate it, and would destroy it if they could. Did Aaron Burr and the traitor Arnold love the Bible? Does Albert Pike love it? Some ten years ago the Grand Orient lodge of France, as is well known, erased from their ritual the name of God and the immortality of m~zn, and though some of the lodges went through the farce of e,~commu- nicating that lodge and its adherents, others did not. And Masonic prints now declare the standing of those atheist Masons good! And why should they not? The standard Masonic authorities, cited in the notes of the preceding degrees, boast their origin from the heathen mysteries; from astrology; from “incantations,” and all that the Bible calls demon-worship. The lower degrees drop the name of Christ from Scriptures used in their lodge lectures, to invite and draw in the Jews and Christ-hating classes. And the higher degrees only admit Him when the lodge-dupes have become hardened by their idola - tries and mockeries; and then only admit Him on a level with heathen teachers; and worship, or rather insult him, by the use of human skulls, cross-bones, and"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"162 ALL RELIGION BUT HOLINESS AND JUSTICE. erossed swords, hoodwinks oaths, blasphemies and sworn secrecy, and concealed ceremonies which His Word and example forbid ! And then, l~aving established and set abroad a system of known antagonism and contempt towards Christ and the Christian religion, they then follow the holy solemnities and sublimities of the Bible, as wolves follow lambs to destroy them and eat them: to save their “cunningly devised fables” and “doctrines of de~ ils” from the world’s loathing and contempt. Let tlic authoritalive teaching of Dr. Mackey be con - tinually borne in mind, that: “Ike mission and object of Masonry is the worship of the areat Architect of the Univcrsc.” It follows Iliat the lodges must have some - thing for their dupes to do, called worship. And what could wicked inca and de~ ils invent craftier or bcltcr suited to deceive the simple, than this very scheme of “the Ancient Scottish Rite,” which now rules the rites of the world. It seizes and appropriates all of rcligion but its holiness and justice; and all of Christ but his truth and his atonemcnt. It mixes things sacred with things profane, till the ~~hole compound is profanity; and quoting the Bible as if~’it believed it true, which notoriou hy i~ does not, it has furnished a dark s~stcm, which angels flee from and which devils inhabit. It keeps its initiates under the power and mesmerism of Satan, and by nightly worships and military drills, it is preparing them for the war and bloodshed which are yet to precede the binding of Satan for the prophetic thou - sand years. But let it be remembered: “Our help is in the name of the Lord which made heaven and earth” (Ps. 124, 8) and that He is mightier than Satan, stronger than “the strong man armed.” (Luke 11, 21, 2g.)

Uaurps the Prerogatl,es of Christ—Uara Have Need of Good Memories” —Renei~iog the Plagues of Egypt on American Soil, To be able to comprehend the nature and power of these degrees, we should keep steadily in mind their “object and mission,” which is to break down the wor - ship of Christ, and establish that of Satan. The very title of the degree does this. The word “Prince” (Latin: prrnceps) means: chief, supreme, the first, or highest one. Christ is the only one who ever exercised divine poi~er on earth. Therefore He only is First, or Prince. Christ gave His life a ransom for sinners, and “G-reater love hath no man than this.” (John 15, 1.3.) Therefore He is “Pnnce of Mercy,” and the only one. There eannot be many firsts. An earthly prince is first in his rea]m~ So our chief magistrate is the highest, or first officer. Christ told Pilate that He eame into this world to be its lung, not an earthly sovereign, yet a born king. (Jno. 18, 37.) And as Savior, or pro - curer of pardon, He is “Princ’e of Mereij,” “that in all things He might have the pre-e~minence.” (Col. 1, 18.) Now the Senior Warden says: “I am about to open a Chapter of Princes of Mercy.” (P. 166.) This is solecism, absurdity and blasphemy, and eaeh in the highest degree. It is gross impropriety of language; inconsistent with obvious truth; and indignity offered to God. As night-meeting societies, which should, in sober earnest, elect and inaugurate Presidents of the United States, and attempt to clothe them with presi - dential power and prerogative, would be guilty of ribald nonsense, moekery towards the President, and swindling imposition on taxed candidates. This 26th degree therefore is a direct insult to and as~iult upon Christ; doubtless stimulated and se~ on by the devil, who asked Jesus to worship him, as HiB superior or equal! We can well believe Dr. Mackey, who says (Note £96) “It is one of the eight degrees which were added, on the organization of the Scottish Rite, to the original twenty-five of the Rite of Per - fection.” Not, like the Knight of the Axe, which is an American stump speech, injected into the body of the rite, to please laborers and get their money; but se - lecLed from several thousands invented by Jesuit8 in France to proteet Romish priest-power, and called “a. Christian degree.” (See Note £66, by Mackey.) But as if absurdity and eontradiction were to prove bottomless, look at the following: In the above Note, Mackey says: “This degree treats of the triple cov - enant of mercy made by Cod with Abraham, Moses and Jesus Christ.” Now turn forward to page 176, and read the answers of the Senior Warden to the Most Excellent, which declare the three covenants of thi8 degree to be made by God with Noah, Abraham and “all men by His prophets.” “Liars have need of good memories,” but these writers’ memories are bad and their morals worse. Now turn back to page 167, and look at the candidate in this 26th degree, hoodwinked and still searching for “Light,” into whieh he has been brought over and again, and then say, with our Bible in hand, thaL “the god of this world blinds minds.” Is it irrational to suppose that, while that man’s eyes were being blind - folded, the devil was blinding his mind, so that Masons do not, cannot see the contradietions and absurdities of these degrees? When, in all time, and where, iu all the world, is this blinding done, whieh the Bible im - putes to Satan, unless iI~ is done then and there? It will not do for them to meet us with denials of the truth of the Bibler If the Bible is composed of lies, why do they quote it from beginning to end of thi8 Scottish Bite? And if the Bible tells the truth when"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"182 RENEWING PLAGUES OF EGYPT ON AMERICAN SOIL. it says that Satan blinds minds; what minds, if not those of his worshipers? And do we not see in this how it can be that Masons of apparent candor can say, and say truly, they can. see nothing in lodgery which conflicts with the Christian religion? Isaiah (9, 26), predicting Christ’s coming, Bays: “The people ShaS walked in darkness have seen a great lighL” Who were those people “walking in darkness” but those very men whose hill-top worships Maaons truly call “lodges,” and the worshipers themselves, “our ancient brethren,” and who, as Masons have today, had counterfeit “Princes of Mercy” of their own make? Read on page 169 the lying promises of this dark degree. “A new earth, more beautiful and more fertile, shall become the home of mankind I” These blind guides, not looking, as Paul did, at “the things not seen,” promise none but a heavwi on earth with good crops, etc., etc.; while the Word of God, and the his - tory of Palestine, nay, our own history also, show that lust in proportion as lodge-worshipe supplant the worship of Christ; drought, grasshoppers, potato-rot and bugs, with swarms of invisible pests, such u deso - lated Egypt and sunk the inhabitants to cattle-worship- big slaves, whose country i8 mortgaged to a handful of London merchants, are slowly~ renewing the “plagues of Egypt” on our own soil; while Charleston, the city where this Seottish ~Rite was planted, and from which it has spread over America. and Europe, hM plucked down wrath on our Continent in the shape of treason, secession and bloodshed.

Men of high rank and the sons of great men greedily devoured the gras~’; the starving fought together hike dogs for the little bread baked at the ovens; they gnawed the bones that had already been gnawed by the dogs, and noblemen, ashamed to beg, were known to steal bread.

Sickness also, eaused by the rains and the intense heat, decimated the Christian forces. The wounded G~rman soldiers, whom none of the others understood, could not make known their sickness nor their necessities. Certain German Nobles from the cities of Bremen and Lubec, who had arrived at Acre by sea, moved by miseries of their countrymen, took the sails of their ships and made of them a large tent, in which for a time they placed the wounded Germans and tended them with great kindness. Forty nobles of the same nation united with them and established a kind of hospital in the midst of the camp, and this noble and charitable institu - tion and association, like the Knighta of the Temple and of St. John of Jerusalem, soon and incessably, became a new hospitaller and military order. This was in tbe year 1191. In 1 192 Pope Celestin Third, at the request of the Emperor Henry Sixth, solemnly approved of the order by his Bull of the 23rd of February. He prescribed as regulations for the new Knights, those of St. Augustine, and for special statutes, in all that regarded the poor and the siek, those of the hospitallers of St. John; in regard to military discipline the regulations of the Templars. This noble order, exclusively composed of Germans, was styled the order of Teutonic Knights of the House of St. Mary of Jerusalem. After the destruction of the Templars, they were also known as Commanders of the Temple.

Their dress was a white mantle with a black cross, and they, like th~ Elospitallers, were required to take three solemn vows. Before assuming the habit, they were required to swear that they were Germans of noble eztraction and birth, and to bind themselves for a whole life to serve the poor and sick and defend the holy places. Ever to adhere to truth, to attend and nurse the sick and wounded, and never to recede before the enemy ivere their three solemn vows. Truth is the first masonic duty, To leave the path of duty is to recede before the enemy, and therefore you have taken the three vows of the Teutonic Knights 5t and Hospitallers in a still more noble and enlarged spirit. The Teutonic Knights soon became one of the Most Illustrious of the military and religious orders. The three were the chief strength of the army befo~3 Acre, but the siege advanced slowly where there were neither absolute chiefs nor discipline. On the 13th of July, 119~I, it surrendered. In the year 1226, most of the Teutpnic Knights went from the Holy Land to Prussia, the people of which ivere still Idolaters, waging war against their Christian neighbors, murdering Note 810.—”Teutenic Knights. ‘The origin of this Order was an bum. bie hut a pious one.

Conrad, Duke of Masovia, called in the Teutonic Knights to his assistance and gave them, as a commence - ment for their establishment there, the whole Territory of Culm, with all lands they should conquer from the Infidels. De Daltza, the Grand Master, sent thither a Knight called Conrad de Lansburg, who concluded the treaty which was signed by three Bishops of that coun - try. The Knights then entered these northern countries and by continued wars acquired in time the entire sovereignty of Royal and Ducal Prussia, Livonia and the Duchies of Cowrland and Semigal; all vast Provin - ces and capable of forming a great kingdom. And when in 1291, the Sultan stormed and took St. Jean D’Acre, the Teutonic Knights’” that survived returned to Eu - rope and joined their brethren in Prussia and Livonia.

In no age of the world has man had better opportunity than now, to dis - play those lofty virtues and that noble heroism that so distinguished the three great military and religious or - ders in their youth, before they became corrupt and vitiated by prosperity and power. When a fearful epidemic ravages a city, and death is inhaled with the air men breathe; when the living scarcely suffice to bury the dead, most men flee in abject terror, to return and live respeetable and influential when the danger has passed away.

(Mackey,,, in Note 809.) The same contempt for this 27th degree is expressed in stronger terms by Ma - cog, (Note 8192.) Its origin is this. the Teuton.s were aboriginal Germans. When Europe was swept into the craze of the Crusades, Germans, in the siege of Acre, A. D. 1190, formed a German-speaking, Teutonic order of military monks, or priests. They were mendieante, and like those orders everywhere gained wealth and power, as Popish orders still do~by the gifts of the ig - norant and superstitious, ~ho are fascinated by their dazzling uniform and ~anctimonious pretensions. The military spirit is not the spirit of Christ, and mona.steriei. of monks have ever been remarkable for cunning, idle - ness, gluttony, and the most loathsome and del estable vices. Napoleon abolished this Teutonic order, or lodge, when he overran Germany in 1809; and gave their lands to the princes of the German territories, which they had so overspread that its annual revenue had become 800,000 marks; as the secret orders of this country, now, as a spiritual empire, draw more money from the people than the government. Thu 927th degree ta that old Teutonic, aecret order revived! And these “Commanders of the Temple,” here in the United States, as you read on page 198, profess to protect American girls from seduction, and destitution, and “selling their honor for food.” They are, in short~ if we take their professions for genuine, a secret lodge, or - ganized to purify society and abate the social evil; whereas, military monks have ever been vampires of lust to the purity of the sex. Col. Lemanowski, who followed Napoleon from a captain of a private company to the fall of the Kremlin and the retreat from Russia, was detailed by him to blow up the Inquisition at Madrid, during the Penin - stilar campaign. The priests met the Colonel with sanctity and suavity and opened the doors for their ad - mission, where they found nothing amiss, till soldiers poured buckets of water on the mosaic marble floor of the main hall, when it ran down the crevices in the tessellated pavement. Their bayonetd opened a pa~ - sage below, where they found men and women, old and young, prisoners in the Inquisit]on. They brought them out to the crowd of their friends outside. “And,” said the Colonel, “old mustaches, whom I had seen sit down on the corpse of a comrade, after a battle, and drink from the dead man’s canteen, wept like little children at the scene there presented: parents clasping to their bosoms sons and daughters, whom they had given up for dead; and old prisoners looking for husbands and wives in vain among the crowd, who had died or left the country, during the long years of their incarceration in the prison of a secret order! Such experiences of Napoleon prepared him to abolish the secret Teutonic order of Knighted Priests in 1809; which is now renewed as an armed secret order of Free - masons, consisting of men, sworn, with their hands on sword-blades, to conceal the proceedings of their order, So help them God!

But we shall be told, and it is true, that both Mackey and Macoy, leading Masonic authorities, dislike and scout this 27th degree, ati un-Masonic. Well, what is the reason of their dislike? They themselves tell us, in Notes 309 and 3 12; because it lacks “symbols,” “al - legones,” and “p~Ai1osophy.” Now the next, or 28th de - gree, both these authorities hail as the “most important, interesting,” and “by far the most philosophical.” (Note 314.) Turn forward and read the Analysis of the 28th degree, and you will see what they mean by al - legory, symbol, and philosophy: they mean the symbols and allegories of Masonry, which alone give the true “knowledge of God! !“ (Note 319.)

And that Masonry is “the purest philosophy,” and “the basis of all religions,” Christianity of course included! And because this 27th degree does not put Christ on a level with Joseph Smith, and Christianity with Mar - inonism; because, in short, it does not, as the 28th de - gree does, throughout, put the rabble of pagan gods above the God of heavefi, and the worship of devils above the worship of Christ, Mackey and Macoy deem it unworthy to belong to Masonry. But surely, surely, this Teutonic degree, with its secret signs, tokens, and impudent traffic in the name Jehovah on its jewels (page 184) and its prayers, from lips used to blasphemy; surely this grand swindle of the young men of America, dubbing them Knights for money is vile enough to belong to the Ancient and Ac - cepted Scottish Rite; which was manufactured by Jesuits, remodeled and sold by Jews. 4:~ CHAPTER LI TWENTY-EIGHTH DEGREE, OR KNIGHTS OF THE SUN.’ 5 ’ EAST OR AUTUMN.

Though masonry is identical with the ancient mys - teries, it is so in this qualified sense, that it presents but an imperfect image of their brilliancy, the ruins only of their grandeur and a system that has experienced, progressive alterations, the fruits of social events and political circumstances. Upon leaving Egypt, the mys - teries were modified by the habits of the different na - tions among whom they were introduced. Though originally more moral and political than religious, they soon became the heritage as it were of the priests, and essentially religious, though in reality limiting the sacerdotal power by teaching the intelligent laity the folly of the countries into which they were transplanted.

If such a man has invented “the most important of the high degrees,” what must the others have been I Of this degree, whose present ritual emanated from such a mind, Macoy says: “It is strictly philosophical, and scientific;” whose object is “to inspire men with the knowledge of heavenly truth, which is the pure source of all perfection.” (See Note 316.) The Right Rev. Episcopal Bishop Fallows, and a Universalist Minister, named Rounseville, during Mr. Moody’s first meetings, in Farwell Block in Chicago, spoke at a meeting, called to form a “Lodge of Intelligence,” in Oriental Hall in that city. The Bishop delivered an address, and Rounseville a~ poem on the “Mission of MasonFry.” The speec’h and poem were published in the Voice of Mas~,nr-y; and their doctrine is identical with that of this degree, as stated by Macoy, above, viz., that Masonry is the only perfect revelation of “heavenly truth,” and “source of all perfection!” i. e., the only rule of faith and life; thus completely setting aside the Bible as obsolete. To see that this is not misstated, or exaggerated, glance through the degree. Thus we find on page 207: “The only law, by which we cannot fail to come to the knowledge of pure truth.” Page 208: “To know the true light in all its purity.” Note 319: “The higher idea of truth, which per. is properly expressed by a knowlsdge of God ;“ that is to say, salvation truth. And on page 212: “The true Mason, who raises himself by degrees, till he reaches heaven I I” Again on page 213: The candidate seeks, and this degree is bringing him to “the true light.” Now, Christ is “that true light.” (John, 1, 9.) He appeared in ineffable brightness in the transfiguration; in “light above the sun’s brightness” to Paul at his con - version; so to John throughout the Apocalypse; and in multitudes of instances, at the death-beds of saints, this same supernatural light appears. Now, this degree recapitulates the substsnce, and ob - ject of Masonry, up from the Apprentice degree, which is seeking and gaining light in the lodge. But CRUST is not in a secret lodge. He entered no lodge. He joined none; but abjures, prohibits, denounces them. (Isaiah 48, 16.) And we know that the devil hatcd Him; tempted Him; shrank from Him; fled from Him. We know, too, by simple inspection, that the lodge-god is not Christ. Looking at a lodge-procession is enough. And yet we know that Masons profess to get, and lodges to give: “light I” “light I I” “light I I U’ And, whatever Masons are, they are not fools. Where do they get their light, and what is it? We know that “the spirits of devils work miracles” (Rev. 16, 14.) We see, too, that lodges have supernatural power. Nothing else perpetuates them through centuries. We see, too, that believing Masons have light in their countenances.

GIIAND ELF.CT KNIGHT KADOSH. the office which I have the honor to hold in this Council, it is my duty as well as my privilege to address you on this interesting occasion. Were the task self imposed, I should consider that I was rendering myself liable to the charge of temerity; #s it is, I appro,ach the performance of it with diffidence, surrounded as I am by so many bright and honored lights of our Hierarchy; brothers who by their zeal, energy, intelligence and well-directed researches, have shed additional lustre upon our annals. We will not now occupy your attention in the dis - cussions of when or where Masonry first beca~;e a distinct organization, neither will we pause to answer the cavil of those who insist that all of Masonry is con - tained in the first three degrees; nor of those who are pleased to call the higher degrees of Scotch Masonry side degrees; ornamental degrees. Their argument is the old one; that Masonry is unchangeable, and that these degrees, not having been originally a part of the system, cannot belong to it. They mistake progress for change. When the spirit of God moved upon the faee of the waters; when the Great Jehovah ordained the crea - tion o (the world; iyhen the first sun rose to greet with its beams, the new morning and the august command was uttered: “Let there be light,” the lips of deity breathed Masonry into existence and it must live for - ever more; for truth is eternal, and the principles of truth are the foundation of Masonry. Masonry is unehangeable, but it must of necessity in the fulfillment of its mission keep paee with the advance of civilization, the arts and sciences. It must lead and not be lead by them. This is progress; it is not change. Electricity is co-existent with matter. It is the same now, and will be to the end of time, as it was at crea - ton’s dawn. To our forefathers it was a dread inspiring mysteri - ous agent of destruetion, and to this day it is compara - tively little understood. Your own peat philosopher, the immortal Franklin, in the eighteenth century, first disarmed it of its terrors, reduced it to subjection to thc will of man, and opened a way for further investigation. But it was reserved for our day to improve upon the work that he inaugurated, when; Oh wondrous achieve - ment of science; it is become the medium of instant communication between the most distant parts of the globe. A simple wire, wrought out of the bowels of the earth, carries with the velocity of imagination, invisible messengers. The pulse beats of London, Paris and St. Petersburg can be felt and counted on the shores of the Atlantic. And is the principle of eleetrieity changed? No, it is not changed, but the arts and seiences have combined to make it subservient to the wants of man. What is Masonry? Is it not the pursuit of science; the practice of virtue, and the teaching of those sublime doctrines whieh tend to bind the whole family of men in fraternal union? If this definition is correct, if remains for us only to proceed to make the applieation and to trace the means we shall employ in aceomplishing its objeet. It is a task that we should aH zealously undertake, as we shall all be sharers in the glory and prosperity of our united labors, if success attend our laudable efforts. I ask your indulgence therefore, whilst I address myself to the subject, which I shall briefly discuss under three heads. The first, presenting general considerations of the objects of our institution, will conduct our minds to a 290 INITIATION 291"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"I — -— -- Y. ~P—5 GRAND ELECT KNIGHT KADOSH. proper point, whence our work may go hand in hand with our principles. The second will treat of the instructions to be given to candidates concerning our doctrines and precepts. And the thikd, of the encouragement and recompense which await those, who, by their zeal and labors, shall prove themselves worthy. Truth, Light and Liberty are the nahiral heritage of man. But many who admit the correctness of this axiom, in a general sense, exclaim that all cannot un - derstand the truth, appreciate the light, or make a proper use of the liberty which we assert is their birth - right. A large portion of mankind arrogate to them - selves the right to maintain in ignorance and slavish de - pendence, millions of their rellow creatures, the children of the same great parent, created in his own image the masterpiece of his handiwork. If those who possessed the capaeity and power had employed as much talent and ingenuity, and expended as much treasure in the cultivation of the minds and faculties or their species as they have in blinding, deceiving and debasing them, the noble family of man could at this day present a spectaele of so mueh happiness, peace and contentment as to be worthy the regard of their creator, who being good and just, certainly never intended that they should exist in a state of ignorance and misery. The truth of this you eannot but acknowledge, since it is the princi - ple whieh gave birth to Masonry. No, we are not born to remain in ignorance and misery. Masonry then is destined to repair the injuries which society has sus - tained from the machinations of its enemies and to make out the means whereby man may be restored to his natural rights and dignity, as an intelligent being. The degree of Knight Kadosh; that is to say, Sacred or Holy Knight, which is one of the most elevated in our order, presents peat facilities for the accomplishment we have in view. Va explain this end, we must direct our attention rather to the eansideration of what Masonry should be in our day, than to what it has been heretofore. We must, in a manner, draw a veil over the past that our glimpse of the future may not be prejudiced. We will not diseuss further the origin or the history of Masonry. Each one has liberty to adopt the opinions that seem to him most reasonable. To suppose that its source was in Egypt or India; that it sprang from such a war; or such a sect; that it was the offspring of such a revolution, or such a system of astronomy or religion. The Knights Kadosh will abandon for the present the charms of erudition, for considerations of more im - mediate importance. I mean the application of the principles of Masonry to the accomplishment of our de - signs, 8nd it is precisely for this purpose that they established such bodies as that whieh is now convened. Already we have decreed our laws and regulations, and we are now about to commence our labors. We feel the neeessity of putting into operation our lofty conceptions, but at the outset the fear that our zeal may overrun our prudenee calls up in our minds the question how are we to take part effectively in these labors? ‘Who will be our guide, our teaeher? Strange position which reveals in an instant, and notwithstanding our willingness, the obstacles and embarrassments which we must eneoLinter. What shall we teach our disciples?

For you must be aware that this is the aim of all our teachings, of all that you have obligated yourselves to perform. These questions, my bretheren, however important and however embarrassing they may be, happily admit of an easy and simple solution. Your only difficulty will be in the selection, out of the different means which may present themselves; and in order to enable you more speedily to arrive at that choice, I have only to re - mind you of one thing, and that is, the solemn obliga - tion which you have just taken, and which we tacitly re - new every time that we reassemble. You have sworn to combat isnaticism and superstition. Well, Sir Knights, in this obligation you will find the source of all your duties, and the possibility of performing them. It con - tains the dogmas and morality which you will present to those who are worthy of being employed in the noble works for which we are associated. To wage war against fanaticism and superstition, seems to me to be one of the most glorious human efforts of virtue, for it is an enterprise fraught with difficulty and encompassed with dangers, offering no other recompense than the approval of your own conscience, or that of those true brothers who find their sweetest enjoyments in the promotion of the welfare of their fellows, and for those who can ap - preciate such recompense, it is the greatest that can be given or enjoyed. But what is fanaticism and what is superstition? will perhaps be the question of the newly initiated, and how can we combat them without causing disorders in the body politic which they infect, without drawing on our own heads the direful vengeance of those whose prosper - ity depends upon them? What then are fanaticism and superstition? Ah, my brethren, the heart sickens and pales at the mention of those words; the mind recoils with horror at the reflection, they give rise to. To endeavor to paint them, is to expose ones self to their fury. Merciful God; in thy holy name their blasphemous atrocities have been perpetrated. In the sacred name of religion they have polluted thy footstool. When they are mentioned we should drape our temples in mourning, and draw a i’eil over the name of the eternal. Ah! my brethren, vain would be the attempt to calculate the evils which they have engendered; to count the tears or measure the blood with which they have deluged this fair earth. Who can reckon the number of their victims? That which astonishes, while it consoles, is the admirable courage ivhich you still display in entering the lists against those uncompromising foes of human rights, whom no earthly power has ever yet been able to subdue. Having conceived Ihat there is some hope of success, you are re - solved to make the attempt, and you query with your - self where are the weapons that you are to employ? These weapons exist my brethren; they are within your reach. It remains only for you to seise them and to use them with the force of resolution, strengthencd only by the consciousness that your cause is just. These weapons are science, truth and humanity. Fanaticism is the off - spring of ignorance. To ignorance, oppose knowledge, which springs from enlightened education. Instruct the masses; teach them truth. To knowledge add virtue, and the universe is saved. There are no weapons more sure or more terrible than those which I propose. The veriest despots and tyrants tremble before them.

Well, even against these, your weapons are the same. Your only resources are science and truth. Present un - ceasingly to the eyes and ears of all the world the melancholy re~ults of deceit and ambition. The history of the past, spread as a map before them, will be your faithful ally in the contest. Select there examples and facts the most striking. History speaks trumpet tongued of the many centu - ries o~f the degradation and misery of our race. History will speak for you. Its simple but affecting truths will touch the hardest hearts, and confound those of the most perverse. Show them countries invaded, devas - tated, desolated. Point them out valleys strewn with the whitening bones of God’s children and mountains streaming with human gore. Show them that everlast - ing servitude; the tortures, the scaffold, the fagot or the lingering death in the dungeon. There exists still the wreeks of nations which bear faithful testimony to these frightful episodes, in their history, and whose ehildren, even at this day, weep over the ruins of their cities and the blsekened records of their countries. Ask the unfortunate descendents of Idumea of whom Israelites is the ancient name. They can, better than any others, tell you the cost of ignoranee and ambition, and to what deplorable exeesses they lead. Ask them how many millions of lives have been saerificed to them, and at whose orders? Ask them why they burned their infants alive in saerifice to Moloch, the very god of the people whom they had exterminated? Ask them why their priests dethroned at will and murdered their own Mona.rchs, and why their Kings as - sassinated each other? Demand of them under what circumstances the brother was obliged to slay his brother, the father, his son, his daughter, his wife, his friend, the most tender? Unt1~’r what circumstances they were compelled to give whole citie. to the Dame. and exterminate every living thing, and butcher the men, the women and the helpless infants clinging to the breasts of their mothers? Ask of the ancient Gauls for what reason they also burned their women and children as sacriflees to their god Teutates, and consulted the dcstinieb of the future in thcir cntrails? Come down to iiiore modern ages. Ask what caused the division and fall of the Roman Empire? Who mur - dered the Saxons, the Waldenses, the Albigenses? Who mnssaered the Aborigines of America, and half the people of Europe? Listen to that bell; the peals say St. Bartholomew. Who eaused the best and purest blood of France to rain like water over the land? Pass through the streets of the city of Paris and ask who has strewed them with corpses and gore? Do you see the head of the most virtuous of men; of Admiral Coligny? Tell us who struck it off? Who sent as a present the most accepta - ble to the High Priest of Rome, as a trophy in whose infamous revelries celebrated in token of a still more infamous ‘aietory? Who then perpetrated these crimcs; these atrocious deeds? Answer I say! Is it not ambi - tion? Is it not fanaticism, superstition and ignorance? But my brethren, heaven has not put entirely out of our reach a remedy for evils so grave. He who created the sun to give light to the universe, has also created reason, the sun of our human system, and fur - nished science to guide us through the labyrinth of un - speakable diffeulties and ealamities. To contend against this fanatieism Heaven created men of talent, virtue and genius, and each age has given birth to a benefactor of his race contemporary with the most accursed of its enemies.

In your Councils be orderly, respectful and attentive so that the newly initiated may exclaim; “that whieh I have sought, I have found Science, Order and Light. I am proud to have been received into sueh a society.” His heart will be elevated, his mind will be enlight - ened.

Kadosh is a Chaldee and Hebrew word, meaning “Holy,” used in Isaiah, 6, 3, applied to God. This is, therefore, the degree of the Holy Knight. It is com - mon to receive men into this degree, who have not taken all the preceding degrees. Thus, in the degree before this, the Grand Master, by mere authority, re - ceives candidates into eleven degrees, which they have not taken, to enable them to receive the 30th, and be - come Knights Kadosh. This explains, how men of ordinary memories, and busin~ss occupations, can take 33 such degrees, i. e.~they don’t take them. This degree is called, in its ritual, the “Ne plus ultra” (no more beyond) of Masonic knowledge; (page £76.) “though but the Thirtieth degree.” A careful reading of the ritual though, will convince thoughtful persons, that this statement is true; and that this degree is also the ‘~Ne plus tjltra” of Masonic falsehood, fraud, hypocrisy, treason, and general scoundrelism. The proofs of this extraordinary indictment are Ihese: 1. “It is said to have been invented at Lyons in 1743,” that is, 144 years ago. This makes it “ancient.”~ (Note 345.) Now, the ritual is the degree, and this ritual, (page 291.) contains the telephone, which is of yesterday; which proves, that this ancient degree has been tinkered, added to, and amended, from Ramsay to Albert Pike! This falsehood is a century and a half long. 2. The candidate is made to trample on the Pope’s tiara, which bauble is worn in some fashion by every Grand Officer of lodges. This is hypocrisy. 8. Christ is complimented, and His prohibition: “Call no man master,” is quoted. Yet Masons all have “Masters.” This is hypocrisy. 4. This degree, and almost every other, professes to war on despotism. Yet Masonry is the completest despotism on earth; the edicts of a Grand Lodge must be “obeyed without examination.” (Mackey Lex.) Taxation at discretion, without reason given, has been decided lawful by lodge-law. (See Chase’s Digest, art, Taxation.) Why this very ritual gives the Master power to stop and adjourn any debate, by three raps with the pommel of his sword! No slaves on a South - ern plantation were ever bound by the laws of property to a more abject, cringing obedience to their master, than these Masons are to theirs. 5. The candidate allows the Master, to put his (the candidate’s) hand, on a human skull, as a “terrible symbol of human equality;” and they all drink with told: “This is the apex of the Masonic edifice.” (Page him “the cup of devils” out of that skull; and they are"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"F - 308 “NOTHING BUT VENGEANCE IS SPOKEN OF.” 285.) And it is. For it is simple, absolute devil- worship. (See 1. Cor. 10, 20.) 6. This degree quotes Christ’s law of equal “love to our neighbor,” and yet tells the candidate, after he is received: “They slightest indiscretion will cost you your life ;“ that is, they will kill him, if he lets out their secrets; tells the truth, by error, “indiscretion,” or mistake. If this is not Masonic scoundrelism, what is scoundrelism? (See this on page 275.) 7. Yet the candidate is told: “In almost all the rituals of this degree, (and there were seven Kadosll rituals, see note 348.) nothing but vengeance is spoken of.” But this degree is nothing but philosophy, and philosophy discou ntena.nces vengeance. (Page 276.) Now return to page 260, of this degree, and sce the candidate and his Master, stabbing the dead enemies of the lodge! Is not this the meanest kind of vengeance, such as was practiced on Cromwell, by his enemies? Why, this degree swears this same candidate, to “punish crime,” “which I promise to do under penalty of death.” And this, forsooth, is no vengeance, but “philosophy.” Is it wonderful, that the Bible through - out, calls these false worships, “whoredom ?“ There never was a drab, at East Cheap, in the days of Falstaff, or in the Five Points, New York, before Jerry McCau - ley, who could hold up her brazen front, and lie with such impudent coolness, as is practiced in this “Apex of Masonic knowledge.” 8. Why, the very basis of the whole Scottish Rite, CHRISTIAN5 FEROCIOUSLY CONDEMNED A5 BiGOTS. 309 that is, the pretended constitutions of Frederick, 1786, are pronounced, by one Masonic historian, “the Grand Lie of the order ;“ which is endorsed by Folger, and as good as endorsed by Mackey himself; (See note 353.) who says: “the question is not yet settled, whether there were any such constitutions signed by Frederick, or whether Morin forged them, 9. The Grand Pontiff (page 263.) tells the candidate that Scotch Masonry *** admits to her bosom, on terms of the strictest equality, the members of all religions, of all creeds, and of all countries, without any distinction whatever. This is bad enough. To put beast-worship, child-murder, at the Ganges, and relig - ious cannibalism, on a level, is to deny and exclude the religion which condemns false worships. The prophet Daniel would have been excluded, as a “sectarian bigot,,” for violating the broad charity of image-wor - ship. But even this pretence is false. This degree was made and practiced in France, and now in the United States. None of the Asiatic, and other heathen - isms, so praised by this degree, on page 298, prevailed in France, or now exist here. Hence the bigots so lerociously condemned are Christians; those who cor - rupt and enslave the minds of their little children by teaching them the Lord’s prayer, and “Now I lay me down to sleep.” This degree, framed in 1748, was in its full glory when the street cry in Paris was: ‘Tout L’Eveque a la lanterne!” (Every bishop to the lamp-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"310 SHAM PREtENSE OP A UNIvERSAL RELIGION. post!) Those were Christian bishops, and their crime waa Christianity. And the fierce and savage denuncia - tions of “sectarians,” who teach men religion to enslave them, mean Christians.

(The candidate enlers, conducted by the Master of Ceremonies ~ho lead~ him toward the East, and halts in front of the Presi - dent. The door is then closed Most Perfect President—My brother, you desire to take upon yourself an arduous and most responsibk office. There is but one infallible, unerring judge. All human judgment is at best uncertain. The errors of the judge have consequences as serious as those of the crimes of other men, and they must often, however inno - cent and unintentional, produce when they are made lnown by that unrelenting censor, Time, regret and sorrow and sometimes remorse. It is not wise to seek to judge our fellow men. It is a stern duty and an un - welcome task, to be performed when it cannot in any wise be honorably avoided, and never a privilege to be desired and coveted. Woe unto that man who assumes the power or judg - ment, and so to some extent usurps the prerogative of C,od, if he be not himself dispassionate, upright, impar - tial, just. Does your heart tell you that only proper motives lead you to se~k that power and that you may with safet.y to you.yself, take it into your hands? Candidate—It does. Most Perfect President—It is well my brother, if in - deed you be not deceived. Go with your guide; heed well the lessons and the warnings you will receive and return again to me. (The Master of Ceremonies con - ducts him six times around the room halting in turn be - fore each of the six columns in the North and South. and addressed by a brother at each as follows: AT THE COLUMN OP ALFRED :—I was the just King Alfred, of Saxon England. I framed wise laws, made upright judges, independent of my will and that of the people; and caused just and speedy judgment to be given. In all my realm, justice and right were sold to none, denied to none, delayed to none. I slept ljttle, I wrote much, I studied more, I reigned only to bless those over whom I had dominion. I have vanished into the past and many ages have marched in solemn procession by my grave. Yet I still live in the memory of men. They call me “Great King,” “wise law giver,” “just judge.” Follow then my example, or fear to sit in judgment on thy fellows. AT THE COLUMN OF SOCRATES :—I was Socrates the Athenian. I knew the holy mysteries and rcvcrenced God in nature. In the sacred groves of Athens, 1 taught that God was one and the soul of man immortal. I taught obedience to the laws and decrees of the peoplt~ of Athens and the Council of five hundred. When I sat in the Court of the Areopagus, I swore by the paternal Apollo, by Ceres and by Jupiter the King, that I would give sentence uprightly and accord - ing to law, or when the law was silent, to the best of my judgment, and that I would not receive gifts, nor should any other for me, nor receive bribes from my own passion, prejudice or affection, nor allow ani’ other person to do the like by any means, whether direct or indirect, to prevent justice in the court. And when by an unjust judgment the same court condemned, I refused to flee away and escape, lest I should bring the laws into disrepute, holding the gord citizen bound to submit to even the nnjuvt judoineut of the State. If thou wouldst fain become a judge of others, first prepare thyself by learnir~~ to obey the laws. AT THE COLUMN OF CONFUCIUS :—I was Confucius, who read and interpreted to the people of Ancient China, the great laws engraved by the finger of God, in"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"330 GRAND INSPECTOR INQUISITOR COMMANDER. INITIATION. 331 everlasting letters upon the pages of the many leaved book of nature. I said to them, desire not for your coun - try any other benefit than justice. The great law of duty is to be looked for in humanity. Justice in equity; to render to e~ery man that to which he is entitled. He who would stand above the ordinary 1~vel of men, must be exempt from prejudice, self-conceit and obstinacy, and be governed by the mandates of justice alone. Cultivate justice and piety, which great toward yoijr parents and relations, should be greater toward your country. Hear much, reflect much and say nothing superfluous. Let doubt of guilt be acquitted and presumption of in - nocence solid proof. So I taught, and my influence lived after me and was good and gave good fortune to my country, and yet controlled its destinies. That is the noblest recompense of human virtue. Do lhou strive so to live and act, to obey and govern, and thou too mayst live in the good opinion of men after thou art dead and thy influences may make thee too a King over the minds of men. AT THE COLUMN OF~MINOS :—I was Minos, the law giver of Crete, I t~.ught the Cretans that the laws which I enacted were dictated by Zeus the father, for all true and righteous laws and all human justice are but the de - velopments of that eternal and infinite justice, that is of the essence of the Deity, he who assumes to judge his brethren, clothes himself with a power like that of God. To usurp a jurisdiction is to invade the territory of his prerogative. Act so that men may praise thy moderation, thy inflexibility, thy equity and thy integrity. And yet regard not alone the opinion and the judgment of the living, but seek the approval of those who shall live hereafter, whose verdict will be more just, even if more severe. Woe unto thee, if being thyself vicious or crimi - nal, thou dost assume to judge others and still more if thou givest corrupt judgment. For then will thy mem - ory be execrated, and in all time, it shall be the bitterest reproach to an unjust judge to call him by thy name. AT THE COLUMN OF ZOROASTER :—I was Zoroaster, whose words became law to the Persians. I said, “He is the best servant of God, whose heart is upright, who is liberal, with due regard to what is just to all men; who turns not his eyes towards riches and whose heart wishes well to every thing that lives.” So act towards all men that when they die, thou shalt not have to re - gret their death, because thou hast done them wrong and can no longer make reparation. He alone is just who is charitable and merciful in his judgments and he alone is wise who thinks well and not evil of other men. Attempt not to break through the laws of providence, nor impiously presume to correct the ways of God. Nor measure the ocean of his wisdom with the tape-line of thy little conceptions. Neither cringe nor fawn, nor d~pend meanly; but find thy happiness within thyself. Satisfy thine own conscience and fear neither the outrages of fort une, nor the injuries of enemies. Crime is not to be measured by the issue of events, but by the bad intentions of the doer. Study therefore the dominion of thyself and quiet thine own commotions, and hold it the noblest ovation, to triumph over thy passions. Let the long train of thy trophies be within thee, and not without, and when thou sittest in judgment on others, let malice be manacled and envy fettered behind thy judgment seat."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"332 GRAND INSPECTOR INQUISITOR COMMANDER.

I was initiated into the mysterics and wisdom of ancient Egypt, and that wisdom dictated .thc statutes by which Israel was gov - erned. I said u¶nto the people, “Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. “Thou shalt lake no gift, for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous. “Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty. “Ye shall hear the small as well as the great. Ye shall not fear the face of man, for the judgment is God’s.” (Candidate halts before the Councilors.) Senior Councilor—Thou hast heard the words of the great sages, lawgivers and philosophers of antiquity. Remember now the sacred word of the 18th degree. Hear the voice of one whom all Christendom regards as the greatest lawgiver that has ever come among men; and listen reverentially to his teachings. “If ye forgive not men tl~eir trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Fatheruforgive your trespasses. But if ye forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.

(Candidate is con - ducted to the East.) Most Perfect President—Be seated my brother. You have heard the lesson of immortal wisdom., once uttered by mortal lips that have long since mouldered into dust. Through those lips God spake unto men, for from him alone cometh all wisdom. You desire to become a mem - ber of this Tribunal and a Supreme judge in Masonry. The Grand Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret, satisfied of your capacity and qualifications; of your impartiality and justice has, in its wisdom, granted your ‘request. When you shall have been reeeived among us it will devolve on you to administer the high justice of the order, and in that the purest equity must be your guide. In every case submitted to your judg - ment, and whether the matters and the parties be Ma - sonic or profane, you must hear affably, deliberate calm - ly and yield to no other influence, than those of Justice and Equity, of Len ity and Mercy; the four sacred words that with their splendor light every Supreme Tribunal of Grand Inspectors Inquisitors Commanders.

INITIATION. 335 countries in which toleration has found a domicile. In the name we bear, it means one who seeks and searches for, inquires after and investigates the ~.ruth, and the truth alone. The punishment must ever be proportionate, to the offence, and some must not be punished for doing things for which others are not so much as called to account. In punishing also, we must guard against passion and remember that there is no such thing in Masonry as vindietive justice. When you maintain a eanse in argument, in any form whatever; in the court, the market, or the fireside, you are never to forget, or offend against, the rules of cour - tesy and charity, or overpass the boundaries of modera - tion. There must be in your argument neither heat nor bitter words. If you have maturely reflected and are sat - isfied that the grounds you take are wholly right, main - tain with firmness and express with frankness your own Opinion, but not too positively or scornfully towards your antagonist, nor with the use of any words that can justly wound his feelings or startle his self respect. Sug - gestion often convince~ more than assertion. And a modest and courteous demonstration will succeed when rude and positive logic will always fail. Ever remember that being human, you must of necessity often err. That those who hold different opinions entertain them as honestly as you do your own. And that you have no right to deny or doubt their sincerity. Especially never harshly denounce an opinion that more experience and a more thorough investiga - tion may some day compel you to adopt. And therefore always treat your opponents as if it were certainly at some time to happen, that their opinions eoiild become your own. If in his progress upward to this degree, the Mason has not learned wisdom, he has already advanced too far. And it is the doctrine of Masonry that no man is truly wise who is not kind and courteous; charitable in his construction of men’s motives, lenient and merciful, and distrustful of his own ability to resist the allure - ment of temptation and the mighty influences of preju - dice and passion. Remember that you represent the or - der; that you must maintain its dignity and glory, pre - serve its constitutions and act by its laws. And that all those things are committed to your fidelity. You are neither to be subordinate nor subservient, nor haughty, nor domineering, and ever to bear in mind that “quod non vetat lex, hoc veta.t lien pudor.” What laws letter does not prohibit is often forbidden by propriety and fit-. ness of things. My brother, no one should assume a Masonic obliga - tion unless he is convinced that he possesses sufficient resolution and moral strength to enable him faithfully to keep and perform it. It is unfortunately too true, that no cause of insincerity, prevarication and falsehood has been more powerful than the practice of administer - ing oaths; and that attempts to strengthen the obliga - tions of morality and duty, by oaths with exaggerated penalties, are generally found to have no tendency but to relax them.

It was evidently indispensible to establish a special body that should see to the maintenance of principles and the regularity of Masonic forms. The Tribunal of Grand Inspectors Inquisitors Com - manders was thus created, and invested with the power, as it was charged with the duty of visiting the different bodies and inspecting their work; of taking care that caution should be observed in the selection of candi - dates; of compelling a strict observance of the ritual in the higher degrees. To these powers were added by degrees, that of judging differences between the breth - ren and of trying those guilty of offences against Ma - sonic law. These powers and this jurisdiction are now defined, and the mode of proceeding regulated by the supreme authority. To hear patiently, to weigh deliberately and dis - passionately, and to decide impartially; these are the chief duties of a judge. After the lessons you have re - ceived, I need not further enlarge upon them. You will be ever eloquently reminded of them by the furniture upon our altar, and the decorations of our Tribunal. The book of constitutions will remind you of your obligations, and that he alone who faithfully observes the law has a right to enforce it upon others. Token.

To us its three sides represent the three principal attributes of the Deity, which created, and now as ever support, uphold and guide the Universe in its eternal movement; the three supports of the Masonic temple, itself an emblem of the Universe. Wisdom, or the infinite divine intelligence; strength or power, the infinite divine will; and beauty, or the infinite divine harmony; the eternal law, by virtue of which the myriads of suns and worlds flash ever onward in their ceaseless revolutions, without clash or conflict in the infinite space, and change and movement, are the law of all created existence.

Remember also, my brother, that you have other du - ties to perform than those of a judge. You are to in - quire into and scrutintze carefully the work of the subordinate bodies in Masonry. You are to see that recipients of the higher degrees are not unnecessarily multiplied; that improper persons are carefully excluded from mcmbership, and that in their life and conversation, Masons bcar testimony to the excellence of our doctrines, and the incalculable value of the institution itself. You are to inquire also into your own heart and con - duct, and keep careful watch over yourself that you go not astray. If you harbor ill-will and jealousy; if you are hospitable to intolerance and bigotry, and churlish to gentlcness and kind affections, opening wide your heart to one, and closing its portals to the other, it is time for you to set in order your own temple, or else you wear in vain the name and insignia of a Mason, while yet uninvested with the Masonic naturc. Everywhere in the world there is a natural law, that is, a constant model of action, which seems to belong to the nature of things; to the constitution of the universe. This fact is universal. In different departments we call"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"348 GRAND INSPECTOR INQUISITOR COMMANDER. this mode of action by different names, as the law of mattcr, the law of mind, the law of morals, and the like. We mean by this, a certain mode of action, which belongs to the material, mental or moral forces; the niode in which eomrrionly they are found to act and which it is their ideal to always act. The ideal laws of matter, we only know from the fact that they are always obeyed. To us the actual obedience is the only evidence of the ideal rule; for in respect to the conduct of the material world, the ideal and the actual are the same. The laws of matter we learn only by observation and expcrience. Before experience of the fact, no man could foretell that a body falling towards the earth would descend sixteen feet the first second, twice that the next, four times the third, and sixteen times the fourth. No mode of action in our consciousness anticipates this rule of action in the outer world. The same is true of all the laws of matter. The ideal law is known because it is a fact. The law is imperative. It must be obeyed without hesitation. Laws of crystallization, laws of proportion in chemical combination; neither in these nor in aiiy other law of n~turedis there any margin left, for oscillation or di.~obedience. Only the primal will of God works in the material world, and no secondary, finite will. There are no exceptions to the great general law of abstraction, which binds atom to atom in the body of a ratifier, visible only by aid of a microscope; orb to orb, hystem to system; gives unity to the world of things, and rounds these systems of worlds to a universe. At first there seem to be exceptions to this law, as in growth and decomposition and in the repulsions of electricity, but at length all these are found to be espec - ial cases of the one great law of attraction, acting in F INITIATION. 349 various modes. The variety of effect of this law, at first surprises the senses, but in the end, the unity of cause utonishes the cultivated mind. Looked at in reference to this globe, an earthquake is no more than a chink that opens in a. garden walk in a dry day in summer. A sponge is porous, having small spaces between the solid parts. The solar system is only more porous, hav - ing larger room between the several orbs. The universe yet more so, with spaces between the systems, as small compared to infinite space, as those between the atoms that compose the bulk of the smallest invisible animal - cule, of which millions swim in a drop of salt water. The same attraction holds together the animalcule, the sponge, the system and the universe. Every particle of matter in that universe is related to each and all the other particles, and attraction is their common bond. In the spiritual world; the world of human conscious - ness, there is also a law and ideal mode of action, for the spiritual forces of man. The law of justice is as univer - sal an one as the law of attraction though we are very far from being able to reconcile all the phenomena of nature with it. The lark has the same right, in our view, to live, to sing, to dart at pleasure through the ambient atmosphere, as the hawk has to ply his strong wings in the summer sunshine, and yet the hawk pounces on and devours the harmless lark, as it devours the worm, and as the worm devours the animalcule. And so tar as we know, there is nowhere, in any future state of animal existence, any compensation for this apparent injustice. Among the bees, one rules while the others obey; some work while others are idle. With the small ants, the soldiers feed on the proceeds of the workmen’s labor. The lion lies in wait for and devours the ante - lupe, that has apparently as good a right to life as he."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"3~O GRAND INSPECTOR INQUISITOR COMMANDER. INITIATION. 35! Among men, some govern, some serve. Capital coin - mands and labor obeys. And one race superior in intel - lect, avails itself of the strong muscles of another that is inferior. And yet, for all this, no one impeaches the justice of God. No doubt all these varied phemomena are consistent with one great law of justice, and the only difficulty is that we do not, and no doubt we can - not, understand that law. It is very easy for some dreaming and visionary theorist to say that it is niost evidently unjust for the lion to devour the deer, and for the eagle to tear and eat the wren, but the trouble is that we know of no other way, according lo the frame, the constitution and the organs which God has given them, in which the lion and the eagle could manage to live at all. Our little measure of justice is not God’s measure. His justice does not require us to relieve the hard-working millions of all labor; to emancipate the serf or slave, unfitted to be free, from all control. No doubt underneath the little bubbles which are the lives, the wishes, the wills and the plans of ten hundred in il - lions or more of human beings on this earth, (for bub - bles they are, judging by ,~he space and time they occupy in this great and age-outlasting sea of human-kind). No doubt, undernedth them all resides one and the same eternal force, which they shape into this or the other special form. And over all the same paternal pro - vidence presides, keeping eternal watch over the little and the great, and producing variety of effect, from unity of force. It is entirely true to say that justice is the constitu - tion, or fundamental law of the moral universe; the law of right, a rule of conduct for man, (as it is for every other living creature). In all his moral relations, io doubt all human affairs, (hike all other affairs) must he subject to that, as the law paramount. And what is sight 1 agrees therewith and stands, while what is wrong con - flicts with it and falls. The difficulty is what we evev erect our notions of what is right and just, into the las of justice, and insist that God shall adopt that as his law; instead of striving to learn by observation and re - flection what his law is, and then believe that law to be eonsistent with his infinite justice, whether it corre - sponds with our limited notion of justice, or does not so correspond. We are too wise in our own conceit, and ever strive to enact our own little notions into the uni - versal laws of God. It might be difficult for man to prove, even to his own satisfaction, how it is right or just for him to subjugate the horse and ox to his ser - vice, giving them in return only their daily food, which God has spread out for them on all the green meadows and savannahs of the world. Or how it is just that we should slay and eat the harmless deer, that only crop the green herbage, the buds and the young leaves and drink the free running water that God made common to all; or the gentle dove, the innocent kid, the many other living things that so confidently trust to our pmo - tection. Quite as difficult perhaps, as to prove it just for one man’s intellect, or even his wealth, to make an - other’s strong arms his servants, for daily wages or for a bare subsistence. To find out this universal law of justice is one thing; to undertake to measure off something, w~thi our own little tape.line, and call that God’s law of justice, is an - other. The great, general plan and system, and the great general laws enacted by God, continually produce what, to our limited notions, is wrong and injustice, which hitherto men have been able to explain to their own satisfaction, only by the hypothesis of anothei’ existence, in which all inequalities and injustices in this life will be remedied and compensated for. To our ideas of jus -"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"352 GRAND INSPECTOR INQUIsITOR COSIMANDKR. 12U?WflON. 858 th~e, it is very unjust that the child is made miserable for life by deformity or organic disease, in consequence of the vices of its father, and yet that is part of the universal law. The aneients’said that the child was punished for the sins of its father. We say that its deformity, or disease, is the consequence of its father’s vices, but so far a~ concerns the question of justice, or injustice, that is merely the change of a word. It is very easy to lay down a broad general principle, embodying our own idea of what is absolute justice, and insist that everything shall conform to that. To say. all human affairs must be subject to that, as the law paramount, and what is right agrees therewith and stands; ~vhat is wrong conflicts and falls. Private cohesions of self-love, of friendship or of patriotism. must all be subordinate to this universal gravitation ts - ward the eternal right. The difficulty is that in this universe of necessities, God created; of sequences; of cause and effect, and of life evolved from death; this interminable succession and aggregate of crueltie~, will not conform to any such. absolute principle or~arbitrary theory, no matter in what sounding words and glittering phrases it may be embod - ied. Impracticable rules in morals are always injurious, for, as all men fall short of compliance with them, they turn real virtues into imaginary offences against a forged law. Justice as between man and man, and as between man and the animals below him, is that which, under, and according to the God created relations existing between them, and the whole aggregate of circumstances sur - rounding them, is fit and right, and proper to be done, 1 with a view to the general as well as to the individual interest. It is not a theoretical principle by which the very relations that God has created and imposed on us, are to be tried, and approved or condemned. God has, made this great system of the universe and enacted general laws for its government. Those laws environ everything that lives, with a mighty net-work of necessity. He chose to create the tiger, with such organs that he cannot crop the grass, but must eat other food or starve. He has made man carniverous also, and the smallest singing bird is as much so as the tiger. In every step that we take, in every breath we draw, is involved the destruction of a multitude of animated existence, each, no matter how minute, as much a living creature as our - selves. He has made necessary among mankind, a divi - sion of labor, intellectual and moral. He has made necessary the varied relations of society and dependence; of obedience and control. What is thus made necessary cannot be unjust, for if it be, then God, the great law - giver, is himself unjust. The evil to be avoided, is the legalization of injustice and wrong, under the false plea of necessity. Out of all the relations of life grow duties, as natur - ally and as undeniably, as the leaves grow upon the trees. If we have the right, created by God’s law of neces - sity, to slay the lamb that we may eat and live, we have no right to torture it in so doing, because that is in no wise necessary. We have the right to live, if we fairly can, by the legitimate exercise of our intellect, and hire or buy the labor of the strong arms of others, lo till our ground, to toil in our manu factories; but we have no right to over-work or under-pay them. It is not only true that we may learn the moral law"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"a ___ -- —t — 854 GRAND INSPECTOR INQUT5TTOR COMMANDER. of juslice; the law of right, by experience and observa - tion, but that God has given us a moral faculty, our conscience, which is able to perceive this law directly and immediately, by intuitive perception of it. And it is true that mant has, in his nature, a rule of conduct higher than he has ever yet come up to; an ideal of na - ture that shames his actual history, because man has ever been prone to make necessity; his own necessity, the necessities of society, a plea for injustice. But this notion must not be pushed too far. For if we substi - tute this ideality for actuality, then it i 5 equally true, that we have within us an ideal rule of right and wrong, to which God himself, in his government of the world, has never come and against which he (we say it reven - entially) every day offends. We detest the tiger and the wolf, for their rapacity and love of blood, which are their nature. We revcilt against the law, by which the crooked limbs and diseased organism of the child, are the fruits of the father’s vices. We even think that a God, omnip - otent and omniscient, ought to have permitted no pain, no poverty, no servitude. Our ideal of justice is snore lofty than the actuahitie~ of God. It is wehl as all else is wehh. He has given us that moral sense, for wise and benifi - cent purposes. We accept it, as a significant proof of the inherent loftiness of human nature, that it can ascer - tain an ideal so exalted, and we should strive to attain it, so far as we can do so consistently with the relations which he has created, and the circumstances which sur - round us and hold us captive. If we faithfully use this faculty of conscience; if ap - plying it to the existing relations and circumstances we develop it and all its kindred powers, and deduce the duties that out of these relations and those circum - INITIATION. 355 stances, limited and qualified by them, arise and become obligalory upon us, then we learn justice; the law of right; the divine rule of conduct for human life. But if we undertake to define and settle the mode of action, that belongs to the indefinitely perfect nature of God and to set up an ideal rule beyond all humaui reach, we soon come to judge and condemn his work, and relations which it has pleased him in his infinite wisdom to create. A sense of justice belongs to human nature and is a part of it. Man can find a deep, permanent and instinct - ive delight in justice, not only in the outward effects, but in the inward cause, and by his nature love this law of right; this reasonable rule of conduct, this justice, ‘with a deep and abiding love. Justice is the object of conscience, and fits it as light fits the eye and truth the mind. Justice keeps just relations between men. It holds the balance between nation and nation; between a man and his family, Iribe, nation and race; so that his absolute rights and theirs do not interfere, nor their ultimate interests ever clash, nor the internal interests of Ihe one prove antagonistic to those of all, or of any other one. This we must believe, if we believe that God is just. We must do justice to all, and demand of all. It is a univeysal human debt; a universal human claim. But we may err greatly in defining what that justice is. The temporary interests, and what to human views are the rights of many, do often interfere and clash. The life interests of the individual, often conflict with the permanent interests and welfare of society; and what may seem to be the natural rights of one class or race, with those of another.

Often one man, and many men, must be sacrificed, in the ordinary sense of the term, to the in - terest of the many. It is a comfortable fallacy to the scifish; for if they cannot, by the law of justice, be sac - rificcd for the ~omnion good, then their country has n~ right to demand of them self-sacrifice; and he is a fool who lays down his life, or sacrifices his estate, or even his luxuries, to ensure the safety or prosperity of his country. According to that doctrine, Curtius was a fool, and Leanidas an idiot, and to die for one’s country is no longer beautiful and glorious, but a mere absurd - ity. Then it is no longer to be asked that the common soldier shall receive, in his bosom, the sword or bayonet thrust, which otherwise would let out the life of the great commander, on whose fate hang the liberties of his country, and the welfare of millions yet unborn. On the contrary, it is certain that necessity rules in all the affairs of men, and that the interest, and even the life of one man, must often be sacrificed to the in - terest and wclfare of his country. Some must ever lead the forlorn hope. The missionary must go among sav - ages, bearing his life ~ his hand. The physician must expose himself to pestilence, for the sake of others. The sailor, in the frail boat upon the wide o~an, escaped from the foundering and burning ship, must step calm - ly into the hungry waters, if the lives of the passen ers can be saved, only by the sacrifice of his own. 4110 pilot must stand firm at the wheel, and let ~he flames scorch away his own life, to ensure thc common safety of those whom the doomed vessel bears. The mass of men are always looking for what is just. All the vast ma - chinery which makes up a State—a world of State6— is, on the part of the people, an attempt to organize, not that ideal justice which finds fault with God’s ordi - Dances, but that practical justice, which may be attained in the actual organization of the world. The minute and wide-extending civil machinery, which makes up the law and the courts, with all their officers and imple - ments, on the part of mankind, is chiefly an effort to re - duce to practice the theory of right. Constitutions are made to establish justice. The decisions of Courts are reported, to help us judge more wisely in time to come. The nation aims to get to - gether the most just men in the State, that they may in - corporate into statutes, their aggregate sense of what is right. The people wish law to be embodied in justice, ad - ministered without passion. Even in the wildest ages, there has been a wild, popular justice. But always mixed with passion and administered with hate; for justice takes a rude form with rude men, and becomes less mixed with hate and passion in more civilized coin - munities. Every progressive state revises its statutes and revolutionizes its constitution from time to time, seck - ing to come closer to the utmost, possible, practical jus - tice and right, and sometimes, following theorists and dreamers, in their adoration of the ideal, by erecting into law positive principles of theoretical right, works practical injustice and then has to retrace its steps. Litcr~ry men, always look for practical justice, and desire that virtue should have its own reward, and vice its appropriate punishment. They are ever on the side of justice and humanity, and the majority of them have an ideal justice better than the things about them. Juster than the law, for the law is ever imperfect, not attaining even to the utmost practicable degree of perfection. And no man is as just as his own idea of possible and practicable justice. His passions and his"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"358 GRAND INSPECTOR INQUISITOR COMMANDEL INCTIATION. 359 necessities ever cause him to sink below his own ideal. The ideal justice, which men ever look up to and strive to rise toward, is true, but it will not be realized in this world. Yet we must approach as near to it as practica - ble, as we should do toward that ideal democracy that now floats before the eyes of earnest and religious men; fairer than the Republic of Plato or Moore’s Utopia, or the golden age, or fabled memory; only taking care that we do not, in striving to reach and ascend to the im - possible ideal, neglect to seize upon and hold fast to the possible actual. To aim at the best, but be content with the best possible, is the only true wisdom. To insist on the absolute right, and throw out of the calculation the important and all-controlling element of necessity, is the folly of a mere dreammier. In a world inhabited by men with bodies, and necessarily with bodily wants and animal passions, the time will never come when there will be no want, no oppression, no servitude, no fear of man, but only love. That can never be, while there are inferior intellects, indulgence in low vice, improvidence, indolence, awful visitations of pestilence and war and famine, earth - quake and volcano, that must of necessity cause men to want, serve, suffer ~nd fear. But still, the plowshare of justice is ever drawn through and through the field of the world, uprooting the savage plants. Ever we see a continual and progres - sive triumph of the right. The injustice of England, lost her America, the fairest jewel of her crown. The injustice of the French aristocracy and clergy, bore them to the ground more than the revolution of 1789 did, and exiled them to foreign lands, there to pine away and die; their fale a warning to bid mankind be just. We intuitively understand what justice is better than we can depict it. What it is in a given case depends so much on circumstances, that definitions of it are wholly deceitful. Often it would be unjust to society to do what’ would, in the absence of that consideration, be pronounced just to the individual. General proposi - tions of man’s right to do this or that are ever fallacious, and not unfrequently it would be most unjust to the individual himself, to do for him what the theorist, as a general proposition, would say was right and his due. We should ever do unto others what, under the same circumstances, we ought to wish, and have the right to wish, they should do unto us. There are many cases, cases constantly occurring, ‘where one man must take care of himself, in preference to another, as where two struggle for the possession of a plank that will save one but cannot uphold both. Or ‘where assailed he can save his own life, only by slaying his adversary. So one must prefer the safety of his country to the lives of her enemies, and sometimes to insure it to those of her own innocent citizens. The retreating general may cut away a bridge behind him to delay pursuit, and save the main body of the army, though he thereby surrenders a detachment, a battalion, or even a corps of his own force, to certain destruction. These are not departures from justice, though like other instances where the injury or death of the individ - ual is the safety of the many, where the interest of one individual class or race, is postponed to that of the pub - lic, or of the superior race. They may infringe some dreamers ideal rule of justice. But every departure from real, practical justice, is no doubt attended with loss to the unjust. man, though the loss is not reported to the public. Injustice, public or"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"360 GRAND INSPECTOR INQUISITOR COMMANDER. flhITL&TTOW. 361 private, like every other sin and wrong, is inevitably followed by its consequences. The Relfish, the grasping, the inhuman, the fraudulently unjust; the ungenerous employer and the cruel master, are detested by the great popular heart, ‘~rhile the kind master, and liberal ~xnploy- er, the generous, the humane and the just, have the good opinion of all men, and even envy is a tribute to their virtues. Men honor all who stand up for truth and right, and never shrink. The wor]d builds monu - ments to its patriots. Four great statesmen, organizers of the right, embalmed in stone, ]ook down upon the law - givers of France, as they pass to their hail of Iegi~la - tion; silent orators to tell how nations ]ove the just. How we revere the marble lineamcnts of those just judges, Jay and Marshall that look so calmly towards the living bench of the Supreme Court of the United States! What a monument Washington has built in the heart of America and all the world, not because he dreamed of an impracticable, ideal justice, but by his constant efforts to be practically lust. But necessity alone, and the greatest good of the greatest number, can legitimately interfere with the domiifion of absolute and ideal justice. Government should not foster the strong at the ex - pense of the weak, or protect the capitalist and tax the laborer. The powerful should not seek a monopoly of development and enjoyment. Not prudence only and the expedient for to-day should be appealed to by states - men, but conscience and the right. Justice should not be forgotten in looking at interest, nor political morality neglected for politic~ economy. We should not have national housekeeping instead of national organization for the basis of right. We may well differ as to the abstract right of many things; br every such question has many sides, and few men look at all of them; many only at one. But we all readily recognize cruelty, unfairness, inhumanity, par - tiality, over-reaching, hard-dealing, by their ugly and familiar lineaments.

Filled With Vain RepetitIons—Republican Appointment of a Vaunnic Rebei—Ciain,a to Rule Judicially the Masonic Order—The ways of the Lodge Are Movable. This degree covers sixty pages, so dull, prolix, and humdrum, that they remind one of the “vain repeti - tions” of the heathen, which Christ forbade. Nineteen pages are filled by the “Illustrious Advocate,” with a tedious compound dessertation on the metaphysics of “justice,” “ideal,” and “actual,” leading nowhere, and teaching nothing. Indeed, knowing that Masons who run lodges are neither fools, nor blockheads, but sly, keen men; one would be at a loss for the motive which has produced such solemn humbuggery, but for the fact that pickpockets practice similar arts to amuse the crowd, while feelirg for their purses; and Mormons and other religious impostors teach wonderful things, to awe the ignorant, and keep them still, while devils mesmerize them. In this thirty-first degree, for which the writers give neither date nor origin, nine men erect themselves into a “Sovereign Tribunal,” or Supreme Court, to rule Masons! Their “Advocate” (page 343) speaks of it as “created,” but says not when, where, or by whom. Who could “create” them into a tribunal, when there was no higher power to create them; and in Masonry, no appeals to the people are ever made.

Morin set up for himself, and his cmzployers denounced him as an “audacious juggler;” recalled his patent, and appointed a weak Brother Martin in his place. Little cared Mori’n for that. lie appointed six - teen other Inspectors, thirteen of whom were Jews. These created a degree of Inspectors, which is this 31st degree! And when Morin had made money enough by the sale of Masonic degrees and dignities, he disap - peared from history, and Masonic writers say they know not where he lived, or when he died! But his work lived after him. his “Inspectors,” in 1801, becariie the present Supreme Council, Southern Jurisdiction, Charleston, S. C.; added eight degrees to the twenty- five commItted by “the Emperors” to Mann; altered, stretched, and modified the twenty-five, and made “The Ancient, Accepted Scottish Rite” of thirty-three de - grees, which now rules the Masonic world ; of which Albert Pike, of Washington is now (1887) Sovereign Grand Inspector General, with a salary of $1,000 a month, “ad vitam.;” (for life) with access to ~dasons of both parties in Congress, who gave his son a clerk - ship under Hayes’ (Republican) administration; with a salary of $2,000 a year. Gen. Pike was a rebel se - cessionist. If these facts, taken wholly from the highest Masonic authorities, are true, the “Ancient, Accepted Scottish Rite” is as liable to indictment for swindling, getting money under false pretenses, and gambling practices, as mock auctions, lotteries, Faro Banks, and rrhree Monte men. And if the Masonic charters granted by Congress and the State Legislatures, can be withdrawn, the laws will treat the lodges as they are now handling the in - stitutions of Mormonism. The two institutions axe morally and legally the same. The jewel of this thirty-first degree is a “Teutonic cross;” the jewel of an order, or degree, which both Mackey and Macoy say was unfit to be put into the Ancient and Accepted Soottish Rite; and that it was only admitted to fill up a gap. And the members who are judges, wear no aprons, which are badges of labor. They are above it. (Note 361.) But these are trifles. Here in this thirty-first degree we have a “Sovereign Tribunal,” or Supreme Court; meeting in magnificent court-rooms, with court oflicers, “Advocate,” and “Defender ;“ claiming to rule, judi - cially, the Masonic order; and aspiring to rule all secret orders; which draw more, far more money from the people of the United States, than the Civil Govern - ment. It administers its own oaths; issuing its own decrees; and swearing its subjects to obey them, on pain. of death; and that in the preceding degree, (Knight of Kadosh) which claims to be softened and modified from the seven old Kadoshes which breathed, says the ritual: “Nothing but vengeance;” and our own Court, and Legislative records show, not only “breathed vengeance,” but executed it. And so powerful have these secret lodges become, at times, and so dire their secret “vengeance,” that every nation in Europe has, at times, suppressed them in self-defense. And now, England and Sweden, and Denmark live by sufferance of the lodges; adopting the compliance which the devil demanded of Christ, viz., practicing their secret wor - ships I This is sufficiently horrible.

Apollo, and Bel, (see Page 346, and the degrees gen - erally) as equally authoritative with Christ’s. It lauds Moses, on the same page with Christ, (332) and, in a degree or two back, assails Moses’ teachings with a savage bitterness equal to that of the coarsest infidel the United States ever produced. The Bible says of the harlot: “Her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them.” (Prov. 5, 6.) And false religion is the “Great whore that sitteth on many waters.” And Masonry, or the secret lodge system, is the “image” of that beast. And the ways of the lodge are “movable,” like those of the “mother of harlots !“ This is what calls on every child of God, on every patriot, every philan - thropist, who does not wish to see the religion of Egypt transferred from the Nile to the Mississippi, to rise, and call on God for deliverance from this “Ancient and Accepted Rite;” which, in this thirty-first degree, and in all its degrees, puts~ the mysteries of Osiris on a level with the revelations of Jesus Christ!!

Master of Ceremonies—To be admitted a Prince of this Grand Consistory, that he may the more effectually ~id in the great struggle for which Masonry is prepar - ing, the second war against the giants, in which the lib - erty and happiness of humanity are at stake. Commander in Chief—What means does he possess, and with what arms is he supplied, that can render him an efficient soldier in our ranks? Master of Ceremonies—He has courage and pure in- ten tion S. Commander in Chief—Are they enough? Master of Ceremonies—No! He needs further instruc - tions to have the veil finally removed, that has so long interposed between him and the true Masonic light; to attain the summit of the mounlain up whose slopes he commenced to toil as an Entered Apprentice, and above all, the aid of him in the hollow of whose hand are victory and disaster, and who alone can give us strength to overcome. Commander in Chief—We rejoice to receive the an - swers. My brother your motives are worthy of all praise. and if you are sincere; if you adopt as your own what the Grand Master of Ceremonies answered in your name. your claim to be admitted among us is legitimate and valid.

Candidate—I do. Commander i~n Chief—Then your hopes of admission here, and of ultimate victory in the great contest that approaches are well founded. We are satisfied as to the purity of your motives and that you possess the requisite resolution and courage; but you are aware that more is needed, in him who would be invested with the highest rank, and take upon himself the responsibilities of Com - mand. To wear that honor worthily and perform efficiently the duties it imposes, you must possess in - tellect, the talent to command and ample information. We demand of you that proof. My brethren, free this aspiring brother from his bonds, and bid him lay his poniard on the altar. (The candidate places his two poniards on the altar, the cord is taken off and the two brothers retire to their places, the Grand Master of Ceremonies remaining alone with the candidate.) Commander in Chief—My brother, the cause to which you desire to devote yourself -is a noble one. Their de - votion to it, has ~ all the great patriots and philanthropists, of all ages of the world illustrious, and their names and memories the richest inheritance of the human race. It is most honorable in you to seek to follow their example, and so to be the benefactor of your kind.

Do you dare to do and suffer, and have you a hand to burn, like Scaevola, for your country or your friend? Can you, and do you an - swer these questions in the affirmative? Candidate—I can and I do. Commander in Chief—Then let your vows be sacred, and your promises made upon the altar of your heart. Go now and study the symbolism of this degree, and learn its meaning, that you may be prepared to do what further we shall require of you.

The camp which you are entering and its several parts are all symbols, the meaning of which we will hereafter endeavor to explain to you. As you pass around and through this symbolic camp, we will give you the necessary, explanations as to its external features, and recall briefly to your mind the characteristics of the several degrees, whose standards float over the camp, to aid you in hereafter understand - ing the esoteric meaning of the whole.

The external lines of the camp form a nonagon, or a figure o f geometry ‘with nine equal sides.

But each symbol and ceremony of Masonry, has more than one meaning; one enveloped as it were, within the other, and all not developed or made known at once. The inmost meaning of the first degree is man subjugated and struggling toward freedom, blinded by superstition, destitute of knowledge, defenceless, and with the chains of despotism round him. He knocks timidly at the door of Masonry, is received, sworn to secrecy and made to stand upright in the mid - die of the lodge, as a man; as a man! It is his first lesson. Before then he was half naked, and half clad, neither barefoot nor shod, half free - man and half serf. THE SECOND DEGREE :—.Shows the necessity and holi - ness of labor, and consequently of knowledge. Man perceives here that to supply his physical wants, his orgar~s are but the instruments of intellect, the expan - sion of which, or knowledge can alone constitute him a freeman and a king over creation. THE THIRD DEGREE :—Teaches us that our inviolable destiny is death, but at the same time, in the ceremony and in the very name of Hiram it shadows forth the great doctrine of another life, and the immortality of the soul. The word Hiram’” in Hebrew, means, “He who was, or shall be raised alive or lifted up,” and it also symbolizes Not. 875.—”Ehrsm Abif. ‘There is no character in the annals of Freemasonry whose life is so dependent on tradition as the celebrated architect of King Solomon’s Temple.

THE SEVENTEENTH DEGREE :—Teaches that every good and intelligent Mason must look upon himself as a pioneer, preparing the way for greater and better men to come after him, and that he must be content to work and do his duty, whether the results of his labor are manifest and visible during his life, or not; to sow no matter who reaps. Soldier of truth, he must always march straight onward, following the route which she indicates, to every loyal man. Death alone must make him pause. Age gives no discharge from her service, and every true Mason may be certain, that if he manfully toils and fights in her cause, he will, whether the effect of his labors be seen by his mental eyes or not, leave to others who come after him, a noble heritage, ever to increase, as Mason follows Mason, in uninterrupted succession un - til men shall succeed each other in this world no longer.

He passed away in doing good, and we are rich with the splendid inheritance he left us. His death teaches us civil and religious toleration, and that, short as is cur mental vision, and limited as our knowledge of the great mysteries of God and nature musi ever be, we must never persecute, or ever become a stranger, to our brethren, because the opinions which they enunciate, conflict with those that we entertain, or are accustomed to hear.

The degree is open to men of all creeds, who believe in the fundamental doctrines of the Ancient and Accepted Rite of Masonry. Every man who endeavors to teach at all, has a mission to perform. God tolerates him and allows him to teach, and we may well do the same. For after all, the will of God governs, and the doc - trine that is true will prevail, while what is false will not.

There are no other meanh by which an iiitelli - gent man can be convinced, however he may be com - pelled.

The old law has not effected the happiness of mankind, nor have the old philosophies. INITIATION. 409 THE TWENTY-FOURTH DEGREE :—Teaches how arduous is the task of a true Mason, who endeavors to oppose sectarianism, for the sectarian will always obstinately maintain his own, narrow and exclusive creed, as the absolute apd only truth, and such creeds will long con - tinue to hold a large portion of mankind in bondage. THE TWENTY-FIFTH DEGREE :—Teaches us to maintain the doctrine of liberty, equality and fraternity, as the only means of gathering around us the intelligent and good men of every lineage, creed and opinion, to repel and defeat the encroachments of idle theorists and kingly and priestly usurpers.

THE TWENTY-SIXTH DEGREE :—Teaches us how a sin - cere and lasting alliance may be effected between the three intelleclual classes of men: The disciples of the natural law and of philosophy; those of the law of Moses, and the other ancient faiths, and those who follow the doctrine of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, or the law"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"410 SUBLIME PR[NCE OF THE ROYAL SECRET.

Knowing this, the Mason’s thirst for knowledge increases, and he learns that only by profound study, can he solve the great problem of the ultimate destiny in store for humanity. The twenty-eighth degree solves that problem and shows the ultimate result of the doctrine of our Master; of that doctrine which is the way, the truth and the life.

When the, Ancient and Accepted Rite of Masonry shall have accomplished its mission, men will rest in the true Edeno in a realm where peace and fraternity will reign. THE THIRTIETH DEGREE —Teaches us to organize that army of tried and veteran Masons, that is to defend the rights of mankind against unlimited regal despotism, sacerdotal usurpation and intolerance, and the monopo - lies of rank, caste and privilege, and cause these usurpers to tremble, like the Babylonian king, when (according to the legend) an awful hand wrote the word of judg - ment on the wall of his banquet chamber.

It is the po - tent auxiliary of tyrants and hypocrites, by which they keep in bondage lh.e souls and bodies of the children of God, who need ~but education to inform them that they are not of an inferior stock, nor born to toil, that power and craft may live in luxury, and rank and privilege be paid and pensioned by the public. Let us then labor to eradicate ignorance, and to ex - pose those who deceive and delude the people, and our Father in Heaven will smile upon our efforts. (At this moment a second gun is fired.) Commander in Chief—The signal is again given. Courage, my brother, and march upon your second campaign. We will in silence offer up our prayers for your success. (The candidate is again conducted, by the Grand Master of Ceremonies, three times round the camp, and again halts, facing the Illustrious Com- mander in Chief.) Master of Ceremonies—IlluStriOuS Commander in Chief, the candidate has returned in safety from his second campaign. ~ Commander in Chief—The second formidable enemy, against which Masonry has to contend, is superstitiOfl, side by side with which ever marches its twin-brother fanaticism. Superstition is the offspring of ignorance, and nothing has more contributed to the degradation of our race. By its influence alone, nations once resplend - ent with civilization, and from which, as centres, science and arts, and all that enlightens and elevates man, flowed abroad into all the countries of the world, are now sunken in stupid somnolence and asphyxia, or have become almost idiotic. The spirit of fanaticism still lives, and is active and L vigorous everywhere. It seems almost to be an essential element of human nature. Against those ancient enemies of the light, we make •mvar, panoplied with the armour of the doctrine of the great teacher of Nazareth, which is the doctriie of Ma - sonry. These doctrines must ultimately conquer, all intelli - gences, and Masonry will eventually rule the world, because its only arms are charity and persuasion and that intelligent logic, of which your sword is the sym - bol, and because it rebukes and disallows intolerance and persecution. (At this moment a third gun is fired.) Commander in Chief—The signal is again given. De part my brother, on your third campaign, while we again pray in silence for your success.

Commander in Chief—My brother, if you had actual - ly, instead of symbolically, undertaken this third cam - paign, for the purpose of measuring your strength against despotism and ambition, you would not have re - turned to us in safety. For while despotism, upon its ancient thrones, guarded by ignorance, superstition, fanaticism, privilege and rank, is too formidable to be so overthrown, it is, at the same time, timid and coward- ly, and therefore merciless. lIt forgives no attempt against itself. The influence that will ultimately over - throw it must gain ground by slow and imperceptible degrees. The tree of liberty grows everywhere, watered by the blood of patriots.

Our object on the contrary is to effect some practical good, within the limits ~f that circle in which our influences may be felt. When men and nations are fitted to be free, they will be so, and a great living example of freedom, based on law and order, is, in its calm, silent dignity of strength and peace, the mightiest antagonist of despotism, and arbi - trary power. We must take care that we do not make the object of our order unreal and chimerical. (At this moment a fourth gun is fired.) Commander in Chief—The signal is given again.

Master of Ceremonies—Illustrious Commander in Chief, the candidate has 7 retu~ned in safety from his fourth campaign. Commander in Chief—My brother, among the ene - mies of true fraternity, one of the most potent is the love of wealth and greediness for gain. The desire for a competency and even for wealth, to be liberally and generously used, is laudable and the parent of many virtues, but carried ~o excess and made the sole object of a man’s life, it is hostile to the best interest of humanity; closes the hand and heart and sets self-interests in opposition to the large and benevo - lent plans of Ma3onry, which it regards as visionary exvensive and absurd; wherefore this inordinate longing after wealth is an enemy against which Masonry has to contend. (At this momenL a fifth gun is fired.) Commander in Chief—The last signal is now given, you must make your fifth and last campaign against the most obstinate enemy of all, after which, your struggles being over, and victory having crowned you with its laurels, their purity unstained by a single drop of blood, you will take possession of your patrimony, re - conquered for yourself and your brethren, and God will bless your labors, and through them advance the cause of true Masonry. We shall soon meet again, but before you set forth, I will give you certain signs and words whereby we may recognize each other, and whereby you will be enabled to detect such traitors as, after their defeat, may attempt to introduce themselves to you; and among your breth - ren you must be cautious and prudent.

The first was promulgated in 1762, by nine commission - ers appointed by the Council of Emperors of the East and West, and by the Council of the Princes of the Royal Secret.

Those regulations, consisting of thirty-five articles, and the list of de - grees, twenty-five in number; the last of which was the Sublime Commander of the Royal Secret, were promul - gated on the 21st of September, 1762. The camp before you was evidently made for that system. Adapted to our present one, it is arbitrary. Now in 1786, Frederick Second, King of Prussia, who ac cording to many was at the head of the order in Eu - rope, framed, or rather approved it is said, a new con - stitution of our rite in eighteen articles, changing the name of Rite of Perfection into that of Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and adding eight new degrees to the old system thus extending the number of degrees to thirty-three, the last of which is Sovereign Grand Inspector General.

EXPLANATION OF CAMP :—We read in almost all the rituals of this degree, that Frederic the Second, or the Great King of Prussia, being at the head of the Ma - sonic fraternity on the continent of Europe, projccted a league of the union of the brethren, Companions, Knights, Princes and ~ of Masonry, for the purpose of rescuing Jerusalem and the Sepulchre of Jesus of Nazareth from the hands of the Turks, by a ncw crusade, in which it was his intention to com - mand in person. It is said that he prepared a plan, by which the army was to encamp, which is the sairie now represented to you, and which is also perpctuatcd on the tracing-board and apron of this degree. But it is not at all probable that Frederic thc Great ever thought seriously of invading Palestine, and wag - ing a new crusade. He was far too busily engaged in the affairs of his own kingdom, and too much of a INITIATION. 429 philosopher to have thought of so chimerical a project. Nor had he any control whatever over the Maaonic fra - ternity, elsewhere than in Prussia, nor even was he Grand Master of Masons thcre, and if he had intended a crusade, he was too accomplished a general ever to have fixed upon such a plan, for a real encampment. It is contrary to all nile. It would be wholly impracti - cable in the field, and it is entirely evident that it is ~nerely an imaginary plan, never meant to be put to actual use. It is equally evident that if Prederic had expected to gather any army of Masons, which he could not se - riously have done, the number of Masons of the dif - ferent degrees would not have been so proportioned as to admit of their encamping by the plan proposed. Of some of the degrees there would have been but a hand - ful, and the Apprentices, Fellow Crafts and Masters, to whom only one of the nine sides of the nonagon is assigned, would have outnumbered all the rest. The camp being therefore, impracticable, and even absurd as an actuality, we must either conclude that the inventor was a man of no sense, or that it is an alle - gory and a symbol. We are certain of the latter. The camp, which is so prominent a feature in this degree, must originally have had a meaning, for it can - not be supposed that a man of intellect ever seriously occupied himself with making a beautiful figure on pa - per, arranging it as a camp and adopting arbitrary let - ters and names without any deeper meaning than that which you have thus far discovered. It is an elaborate, complicated and intricate symbol. Its meaning was no doubt originally explained, only orally, and that alone would be reason and cause sufficient why that meaning should in time be lost. For that cause alone has cost Masonry the true meaning of many, even"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"430 SUBLIME PRINCE OF THE ROYAL SECRET. of its simpler symbols and substituted, strained, un - natural and common place interpretations in their place. The figure is a five-armed cross, enclosed by a circle, that by a triangle, that by a pentagon, that by a ~hepta- gon, and that by a nonagon. On the lines of the nona - gon, are the camps of those from the 19th to the 30th degrees inclusive. On the triangle, those of the 31st and 32nd degrees. It is evident that the distribution of these degrees is now nearly arbitrary. While eighteen degrees occupy the nonagon, being double the number of its sides, twelve occupy the pentagon and two the triangle. It is true that Knights of Malta are added to make three bodies for the triangle, but this is evi - dently a mere make-shift, for they are not Masons, and to introduce them destroys the whole idea at once. The seventeen sides of these three figures in no way suit the present number of the degrees. Then again, there are no camps at all on the heptagon, and so It be- comes a perfectly useless part of the figure. The dis - crepancies in the rituals, as to the distribution of the first eighteen degrees, show that the arrangement. is arbitrary, and there is n6 attempt made to connect the letters of the camp,~ or of the standards, in any way, with the degrees to which they are assigned. They would seem to have been taken at random, like the names of the Commanding officers, which offer the most singular and incongruous mixture. As if further to increase the difficulty, the rituals dif - fer as to the standards to which the respective letters Y. -.E. .N. -.G. ~.IJ. ~.are to be assigned. These devices of these standards are not apparently connected with the degrees in either arrangement, nor is any attempt made to explain their meaning, or show from whence part of them came. Then we are told of three birds, INITIATION. 431 one in each corner of the triangle; L. Raven, a Dove”’ arid a Phenix.”’ No one vouchsafes to tell us where they came from; or the palm-trees on each side of the ark; or the meaning of the inflamed or winged heart; or of the five armed cross in the circle. And if any at - tempt to explain these things has been madc, it is pain - ful to a man of intellect to read the miserable and triv - ial stuff to which sensible men are expected respectful - ly to listen. The reason for selecting georiietrical fig - ures is obvious. The circle is unity, and it with others represent the five sacred Masonic numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. We have deeply studied these emblems, reflected up - on them, and made many researches in the hope of fathoming their meaning. What we have discovered we propose to communicate to you. It is our own dis - covery. We have not received it by tradition. Besides the cause already mentioned, there is we believe, an - other that has lead to the intentional denatu-realiza - hon of this symbol, and that has probably destroyed the possibility of ever receiving the whole meaning. Whether the partial explanation we shall give you is Note 5S4.—’~Thls bird was the diluvian messenger of peace. Slid hovered over the retreating waters like a ceiestiai harbinger of safety.

Our 21st was the 20th; our 22nd was then the 22nd; and our 28th was then the 23rd; our INITIATION. 30Th or a degree like it, was then the 24th; our 32nd was then the 25th, and there was no degree above that; and our 23rd, 24th, 25th and 26th, as well as the 33rd were not tlicn known. The 27th was a dctached degree, and the 29th ~va~ part of another system. The rcgula - tions and constitutions, said to have been n;ade at Bor - deaux, by tile Princes of the Royal Secret in 1762, give the list of the degrees and require 81 months;-that is 9 times 9, by 1, 3, 5, 7, to be occupied in obtaining them. They arc di~ idcd into sex-en classes of 3, 5, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, degrees icspecti~cly ; the time required for obtaining the degrces, in each class rchpectively 9 and 15, or three tinics five months. The regulations term thesc the Illystcrious numbcrs, and there is in article two a paragraph in regard which is translated as fol - lows: “All these degrces, in which one must bc initiated in a mysterious number of months, to arrive in succesbion at each degree, form the numher of 81 months; 8+1=9; as 8 and 9 express 89, and as 9 times 9=81; all of which are perfect numhers and very different from 1 and 8 which make 9 and 1 and 8 compose 18, for these are imperfect numhers, and this combination is imperfect.” But a true Mason, who has completed his time, gathers at last the Masonic rose. Now taking the numhers of the different figures of the camp: Of the circle, or unity, the triangle, pent - agon, heptagon and nonagon, we have 1+3+5+7 +9, which added together make ~5, the number of de - grees in 1762, and placing the Commanders of the Royal Secret in the circle, it leaves one degree for each side of all the right hand figures. Thus the number of degrees corresponds with the figures; the heptagon ceases to be useless, arid the arrangement of the de - grees ceases to be arbitrary. We conclude, at once, that this tracing-board ws.~"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"434 SUBLIME PRINCE OF THE ROYAL SECRET. INITIATION. 435 settled when there were but tventy-five degrees, prior to 1786, and we see at once that cause, ~.dditionah to time and the treachery of memory which has lost us the full explanation of this collection of symbols. It is that aftcr thlc degrccs had been increased to the 33rd, the figures had too fcw sides, and it became necessary to rearrange the dcgrees, and distribute them ancw among the camps. This displaced the letters; assigned one letter to more than one degree; displaced the stand - ards and caused the disuse of the heptagon, and made the whole arrangement arbitrary and inexplicable. This is the key to the mystery; or if it be not, we do not believe there is any key, and with this key we proceed to unlock that mystery as far as we can; knowing that we can only partially do so, and only hoping to put others and more learned investigators on the right track and so be instrumental in the ultimate entire de - velopment of these interesting symbols. We again ob - serve that the degrees of the two scales are identical up to the 18th degree assuming as a reasonable supposition, that the lower degrees were originally assign - ed to the lines of the camp furthest from the centre, because that is natural, because the general feature would in all probability not be changed in the re - arrangement w h i c h the increased number of the degrees made necessary, we at once find that the nonagon, offering us nine sides, accommodates the first nine degrees, begin - ning with the Apprentice and ending with the Elect of Nine, and thflt the heptagon, completing with its seven sides the number 16, accommodates those from the tenth to th~ sixteenth, or Prince of Jerusalem inclusive, and thus, as the regulations do, puts these Princes at the head of the Masons of those sixteen degrees, and this agrees with the regulations of 1762, which de - clares them to be the Most Valiant Chiefs of the Reno - vated Masonry, and gives them control over all lodges of the Royal Perfection and Council of Knights of the East. See constitutions of 1762, Art. 31. Above the 16 degrees then, by the system of 1762, are the following which we number as they stand in both scales: 17. Knights of the East and West. 17 18. Sovereign Prince of Rose Croix. 18 19. Grand Pontiff and Master ad vitam 19 and 20 20. Grand Patriarch, Noachite. 21 21. Grand Master of the Key of Masonry. 22. Prince of Libanus, or Knight of Royal Axe. 22 23. Sovereign Prince Adept or Knight of the Sun.28 24. Grand Commander of the Black Eagle. 30 25. Sovereign Prince of Royal Secret. 32 Now it is obvious that the five sides of the pentagon accommodate the five degrees from the 17th to the 21st inclusive, and if we assign the Princes of the Royal Secret to the circle, as we must do to make the number correspond, we have for the triangle the three following degrees. 22. Prince of Libanus or Knight of Royal Axe. 23. Sovereign Prince Adept or Knight of the Sun. 24. Grand Commander of the Black Eagle.

From circumference to centre and this we do not think the inventors of the symbol would have done, even if it required a little forcing to make the emblems. corres - pond; because one irregularity of that kind would have destroyed the harmony and symmetry of the ~hole systcm, and the idea on which it was framed. Now to the triangle three birds are assigned, apparently in the present s~tem without any meaning. We have seen an attempt to explain them, or give them a symbolical meaning, the succcss of which, if it aimed at being common place and trivial, was most encouraging. The Raven is the Black Eagle of the 24th dcgree; that is the Kadosh or Knight of the White and Black, of which degree the old je~vel was a Black Eagle. That fabulous bird, the Phcpnix, of which only one, it is said, existed at a timc, was in Arabia, sacred to the Sun, and an emblem of that Orb. It was said to burn itself upon a funeral pile when it grew old, and to spring in renewed youtl~ from its own aslics, and hence it figurcd in Alchemy~ that search after the Elixer that was to give iibniortality. Of course it was pecul - iarly appropriated to the degree of Knight of the Sun, or Prince Adept, which originally was an Alcliemical degree, as the very word “Adept” and its pass-word, Note 3S6.~”I’reemasonry and alchemy have aougbt tbe same results.

We do not say that these explanations are correct, but they are at least reasonable and probable.

God, Mithrasm “Deo Soli Invtc~o Mttkrao” to the sun god Mithras the Invincible, also called the Mediator, the fertilizer of deserts, the slayer of the dragon, and of evil spirits. He was worshipped among the Ethiopi - ans and Egyptians in Greece, after the time of Pompey at Rome. He is represented in the sculptures as a young man mounted on the Equinoctial Bull, and plunging into its flank a sword, whose hilt terminated at the upper end in two heads of an Eagle or a Hawk. He is represented as at the mouth of a cavern, with a figure on each side bearing a lighted torch. He is ac - companied by Eorosch, the Celestial Raren, and the dy - ing bull is consoled by Taschtar, the dog-star, the har - binger of his resurrection. The bull was regarded as a symbol of the power that produces vegetation and life. He makes, the Zendavesta said, “the grass to grow abun - dantly and gives all fruitfulness to the earth.” Hence the motto of the standard on which he figures “Omnta Tern pus Altt.” So in Egypt, Mnevis, the black Ox of Heliopolis, was dedicated to Osiris and they wor - shipped a black Bull, which they called Onuphis. The lion, the sign of the Summer Solstice, and domicile of the Sun was the symbol of that orb.

It is this thunder - bolt which has been, in our symbol, corrupted into a sword, with a crooked and wavy blade. Mithras himself was often represented with the head of a lion. The palm tree was not only an emblem of virtue and truth, but it was also consecrated to the celestial move - ments, and abovc all, the annual revolutions of the Sun. Among the Hebrews, it will be remembered, the lion ~vas borne on the crimson standard of the tribe of Judah. The Ox, on the green standard of Ephraim. The Eagle on the green standard of Dan, and the ship on the purple standard of Zebulon. Perhaps the Ark of the Covenant is really the Ark of the Deluge, or the ship of Zebulon. The inflamed winged heart is probably the winged globe or sun, a common symbol in Egyptian temples and an emblem of imn~ 7 ortality. The figure 525 on the golden collar of the lion had originally, no doubt, a meaning connected with the number of degrees or perhaps with an Epoch in the annals of Masonry, but for the present at least, that meaning is lost. Nor have we been able to discover the origin of the several letters which designate the tents of the nonagon and the standards of the pentagon. Others possessed of more extensive learning may hereafter succeed in do - ing so, and also in unveiling the hidden meanings of the names of the commanding officers. We might pre - tend to do so, and give you, as others have done, arbi - trary and perhaps unmeaning explanations, without any warrant but that of our own inlagination. There has been too much of that in Masonry, and we prefer to be satislied with the little that we know, and to leave the rest for future investigation. It will be noticed that the seven watch-words for the different days of the week, all of them names of per - sons, correspond with the number of sides of the hepta - gon, and that if they were assigned to command there, they would make the number of commanders complete. These seven names are curiously enough, those of three Persian kings, Darius, Xerxes and Cyrus. The Mace - donia n conqueror Alexander, Ptolemy Philadelphus, one of his successors, Herod, the tributary Roman king in Judea, and Jewish king, Hezekiah, while all the an - swers are the names of Jewish prophets. The name of Ilerod and those of Xerxes and Ptolemy Philadelphus seem wholly out of place in Masonry. The names of the Commanders of the nonagon; one Phaleg goes back to the building of the tower of Babel; one Aholiab, to the building of the first tabernacle, one JoRhua, is the name of the successor of Moses, one Johaben, is fictitious, one Jehoiada, is that of the Jew - ish High Priest, in the time of Jehoash and Athaliah, and three, Zerubbabel, Ezra and Nehemiab, refer to the rebuilding of the temple, while the one remaining is the name of the last prophet. Of the names of the five Chiefs of the standards, two Bezaleel and Aholiab, were those of the Architects of the tabernacle of the desert, Mahuzen or Masshin, which means in Latin, “Haesintantes” that is, hesitat - ing, it is not the name of a person. Amariah was a common Jewish name, or if it be Emerk, the meaning is not known, and Garimont or Guarimond, was the Patriarch of Jerusalem, between whose hands the first"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"442 SUBLIME PRINCE OF TIlE ROTAL sECRET. INITIATION. 443 Templars took their oaths. We may also observe, without any attempt to explain, that the name of Aholiab appears twice, once as a Com - mander of the nonagon and once as a Standard Bearer of the pentagons The words of the degree offer: quite as singular a mixture and among them is one that may perhaps be found to have a peculiar significance. It is a Hebrew word, “Hochmah.” The word means “Wis - dom” and particularly the wisdom of the Deity, or in the Kabbala,’’ the second “Dephirah’ or Emanation from the Deity, the same as the mind, wisdom and word of Plato. This is perhaps an indication that the camp is altogether a Kabbalistie or Gnostic symbol, and if so, its meaning is to be found in the Kabbalistie writ - ings, in which, so far, we have sought for it in vain, but we know the general meaning of the symbol, and one of the lessons, at least, which it was intended to teach us and to all Masons. The key to that is found in two words of the degreee, which we have already given you. Phaal-Kol, it is said, means “separated.” Separated as Masons have been for many years, by intestine dis - sensions, the jealousies of. rival’ rites, and the efforts of a. illegitimate bodies to exercise usurped powcrs. Separat - ed as mankind has l~een for ages by differences of re - ligious belief, by the ambition and interests of kings by natural lines or mere imaginary boundaries that Nate SSi.—’The Rabhsls may be defined to be a system of phil - osophy nhih embraces certain m~athai interpretations of Scripture and metaphysical speculations concerning the Deity. man, and spiritual beings. in these interpretations and speculations, according to the Jewlab doctors. were enveloped the most profound truths of religion, which, to he com - prehended by finite beings, are obliged to he revealed through the medium of symbols and allegories Buxtorf (LSI.

Separated as men have been from truth and knowledge, by the arts and crafts of a scheming and selfish priesthood. Separated as man has been from. his God by his passions and his vices, as well as his ignorance. And Pharash-Kol, it is said, means reunited. That union of Masons, of all rites and degrees, of which the camp is the apt and fitting symbol, to accomplish the great ends of Masonry, to heal all dissensions within, and produce peace and harmony without, to reconcile all rites and make toleration and charitable judgment universal; to elevate the masses of mankind and to teach them their true interests, to substitute equality and brotherhood in the place of despotic power and usurped privilege; to dethrone anarchy and license and canonize law and order, and in the place of smoking altars of fanaticism and superstition, of bigotry and sectarianism, to set up those of true Masonry, garland - ed with flowers and sending up toward Heaven, mingled with the pcrfumes of their incense, the thanks and gratitude of the human race to a beneficent father, who loveth all the children he has made.

The lodge-theory was that of the anarchists of today, that, if institutions or religion, and government wore abolished, human passions. like fluids, would find their level in universal peace and happiness. Communists guillotined their king, and hung their bishops to lamp - posts; proclaimed “liberty and equality ;“ and put their religious creed over the gate of their cemetery: “There ts no God! J)eath is an eternal sleep.” The last de - gree of their s stern required the candidate to stab his brother, or nearest friend, as a traitor to the lodge, and amid the brother’s groans, and pleadings for his life. they laid the candidate’s gloved hand on the beating heart of a lamb. And, if he stabbed, they removed the blinder, and swore him to vengeance against Church and State. This was “The Royal Secret.” This ex - plains the vengeance sworn in this and other degrees of that day. (See Robtson’s Conspiracy. p. 299.) But, in this country, and at this day, this degree is senseless, and worthless. Its bluster about freeing the people, is meaningless, and itself not worth reading. But how happens this once “Ne plus ultra” degree to be so prolix and stupid as to be scarce worth reading?"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"450 JACOBINS LIKE CHICAGO ANARCHISTS. LODGE AND ROMISH DESPOTISM. 451 The answer is this: when formed by Jacobin Jesuits, in 1754, in the Jesuits’ College of Clermont, Paris, it was “the Military Organization,” as the candidate was told. (See page 897.) It then crowned the Rite of Perfection of c25 degrees, which was adopted .by “the, Council of Emperors,” four years later; that is, in 1758. (See note 877.) The Jacobins, like the Chicago anar - dusts lately hung were then secretly swearing to do what they afterwards did, v&z., wage war on the government. Hence this 32nd grade was not called a degree, but an “organization,” as it was. But when adopte~l by Mormn’s Sovereign Inspectors, at Charleston, S. C., in 1801, no war was then contemplated, but by Aaron Burr, and he was soon tried by Jefferson, for his life. The coun - try was then peaceful, and satisfied and pleased with their free constitution, adopted in 1789, only twelve years before. Of course, no fighting was contemplated. True French sympathizers elected Jefferson that year; but the French revolution had reacted, and the Monroe doctrine was soon adopted, to keep the United States free from foreign cntangleme~ts. Masonry now did not mean fight, but money, and false worship. What then were idaicho, Mitchell and Provost to do? They had resolved on an “Ancient and Accepted Scot - tish Rite,” to rule the false worships of Masonry throughout the world. They adopted a scale of thirty- two degrees; and placed this Military degree at the head: because, it had been, as the notes and ritual say: “the Ne Plus Ultra degrec,” and it would not do to leave it out. They therefore stretched it, and stuffed it into its present shape, prolix enough. Hence the hotch - potch fiummery of a camp of nine sides, with stupid Masonic explanations for every corner. But the one “mission and object” (Mackey) of Ma - sonry is kept steadily in view; which is the worship of the god of this world, who is Satan, as the “Grand Architect of the Universe;” and to accomplish this by inventing “a religion in which all mankind agree ;“ and this, by putting all earth’s religions upon a level, and uniting them together in Masonic worship, which is boldly avowed in rituals, lexicons, and philosophical degrees. This is, (in Revelation, 18, 14,) called: the image of the beast, made by “them, that dwell on the earth;” that is, everybody; every creed, and no creed, all who join secret lodges. But this world-religion must have some form and shape, to hold together; and be taxed; hence, it takes the form, or image, of the beast. Lodge despotism is as absolute as Romish despotism, and is the image of it; and it is made, as we have seen, by the lamb-dragon beast, which is Popery; “that great city, (Rome) which reigneth over the kings of the earth.” (Rev, 17, 18.) Note now the profound craft, by which this is to be ac - complished, viz., Masonry promises men salvation by ceremonies invented by men, administered by priests, and inhabited by devils. This is the sum and substance of all the false religions on earth, and will ultimately units them against Christ. (See Rev. ~2O, 9.) But the only opponents Masonry dreads, is Christ, ~vho refused to worship Satan, and his followers. If there were no Christians in lodges, Masonry would not live an hour. Hence, though Christ is wholly omitted, in the lower degrees, He is taken into the lodges, made by ,Jesuits and Jews, as a tool of incantation, but He is not pcr - mitted to be worshiped there, except by worships ~vhich are paid to devils. In the next and last degree, of the world’s ruling rite, the 33rd, Christ is twice called “our"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"I 452 DENIALS THAT MASONRY IS A RELIGION. Sovereign;” (See pp. 476-7.) but none are baptized in his name, nor do they celebrate His death. The bread is eaten and the ‘vine drunk from human skulls, in honor of devils, not Christ; and though Christ is called sovereign, they trample on His law. Why, then, do they pay him these empty compliments? Plainly, to draw in ignorant, weak, and worldly Christians, and this is what they achieve. Nothing is more common, than the denial that Free. masonry is a religion. This denial is made by many Masons, and by all Jack-Masons, who bear the burdens of the lodge, while claiming merit for not joining it. But the many distinct avowals, that “Masonry is a re - ligious institution,” made by the highest Masonic au - thorities, have been given in their own words. The diabolical craft of the system appears in this; that while “traditions,” which are man-made religions, cru - cified “the Son of God,” they worship the cross, the tool by which they tortured Him, to make believe they were opposed to His crucifixion and torture, as if the assassin should kneel before t~he dagger, with which lie stabbed his victim. Njor is this all, or the worst: claiming that they ~unite all religions in one, they re - nounce and e’cclude the God and religion of the Bible, as “bigoted” and narrow. They work only in Christian hands, not in barbarous and savage ernintries; and they denounce as “bigoted” the religion of the lands where they work. And to crown their falsehood with felony, they ste.il and falsely appropriate the principles aiid fruits of the Gospel of Christ. The quotations which we give below, not only prove that Masonry claims to be a religion, but the true religion, and that its thistles pro. duce figs, that its heathen ritual regenerates, sancti - PROOF THAT MASONRY IS A RELIGION. 453 fies, and saves men. To begin with the Entered Ap - prentice: “There he stands without our portals, on the threshold of this new Masonic life, in darkness, helplessness and ignorance. Having been ~vandering amid the errors, and covered over with the pollutions of the outer and profane world, he comes inquiringly to our doors, seek - ing the new birth, and asking a withdrawal of the veil which conceals divine truth from his uninitiated sight. * * * There is to be not simply a change for the future, but also an extinction or the past; for initiation is, as it were, a death to the world, and a resurrection to a new life.” Mackey’s Ritualist, pp. £~-8. This is Satan’s travesty and burlesque of Bible con - viction of sin, and seeking religion. The Fellow Craft is still compassing Mt. Sinai. Then follows the new birth, or regeneration, not “by the Holy Ghost,” but by the third, or Master’s degree: “This has very properly been called the sublime degree of a Master Mason, as well for the solemnity of the ceremonies which accompany it, as for the profound lessons of wisdom which it inculcates. The important design of the degree is to symbolize the great doctrine of the resurrection of the body, and the immortality of the soul; and hence it has been remarked by a learned writer of our Order, that the Master Mason represents a man saved from Ihe grave of iniquity, and raised to the faith of salvation.”—Mackey’s Ritualist, p. 109. Then follows the Masonic lying-in, in which the devil acts as midwife. The hoodwink falls, the lodge claps and stamps, and the weary, badgered and be- fooled candidate experiences such a ‘change of heart,”"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"454 MADE TWOFOLD MORE THE CHI D OF HULL. FREEMASONRY CONFESSEDLY DEIsTIC. 455 as Saul and Judas Iscariot did after Satan entered them. (See 1 Sam. 16, 14; and Jno. 18, 27.) “THE SHOCK OF ENTRANCE is then the Symbol of the disruption of the candidate from the ties of the world, and his introdi~ction into the life of Masonry. lit is the symbol of the agonies of the first death, and of the throes of the new birth.”—Mackey’e Ritualist, p. 24. This change is not imaginary, but real. The testi - mony of Christ, concerning such priest-made proselytes is: “They become twofold more the child of hell, than be fore.” (Math. 28, 15.) Witness Saul’s attempt to murder David and Jonathan, and Arensdorf’s murder of Haddock, of Sioux City. But not all Masons ex - perience this fearful change of heart. The average of Masons who attend lodge-meetings regularly, is only one in five. Only those, who believe in and practice lodge-worship, become “possessed” by the god of the lodge. After Morgan’s murder, three-fourths of the lodges of the United States gave up their charters. The remaining one-fourth, deliberately became acces - sories to the horrible inhuman murder of Morgan, be - fore or after the fact. ~The? relished, and adhered to Masonic “work,” or~ worship; and “their foolish hearts were blinded.” Of the fact that Masons who are thus bewitched with sorcery, regard and believe it to be a religion, the proof is abundant. Thus their ablest writer says: “Speculative Masonry is the application and sancti - fication of the working tools and implements, the rules and principles of operative Masonry, to the veneration of God and the purification of the heart. The specula - tive Mason is engaged in the construction of a spirit - ual temple in his heart, pure and spotless, lit for the dwelling place of Hini who is the author of purity.”— Mackey’s Ritualist, p. 89. What is professing religion, if this is not? Then also the same writer says of the Shock of Enlighten - ment, or Rite of Illumination: “This mental illumination,—this spiritual light, which, after his new birth, is the first demand of the new candidate, is but another name for Divine Truth,— the truth of God and the soul,—the nature and essence of both,—which constitute the chief design of all Ma - sonic teaching.”—Mackey’s Ritualist, p. 88. We add the following, not because needed to prove Masonry a religion, but to show that it is organized deism: “Every important undertaking in Masonry is both begun and completed with prayer. The prayers given in the hand-books of the Blue Lodge, are such, as all Masons, whatever their religious faith, may unite in. In the orders of knighthood the prayers are, as a matter of course, strictly and intensely Christian. In the third degree a sublime prayer, adapted from the 14th chapter of Job, is made in American lodges an essential part of the ritual of Raising.”—Morris’ Dictionary Art. Prayer. It is evident from the above quotations that Free - masonry claims to be a religion.. Now let Masonic authorities tell us what kind of a religion it is. “The truth is, that Masonry is undoubtedly a re - ligious institution,—its religion being of that universal kind in which all men agree, and which, handed down through the long succession of ages, from that ancient priesthood who first taught it, embraces the great tenets of the existence of God, and of the immortality of the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"456 DEISM IS PR4CTIcAL ATHEISM.

Beyond this for its religious faith, we niu~t not and cannot go.”— Ma key’s .1Iaso~iic JurisprudenCe, page 95. “The religion then, of Ma~onrv, is pure theism, ~n which its different members engraft their own peculiar opinions, hut they are not permitted to introduce them into the lodge, or to connect their truth or falsehood with the truth of Masonry.~’—Mackey’s Lexicon, An. Rebg ion. “All the ceremonies of our order are prefaced and terflhinate(l with praxer, because Masonry is a religious in~titutsoru and beeaii~e we thereby show our depend - ence on, and our faith and trust in (Jod.”—Mackey’s Lezu,on, A rI. Prayer. “Thui~ is the scope and airil of its ritual. The Master Mason represents man when youth, manhood, old age, and life itself have passed away as fleeting shado~~s, yet raised from the grave of iniquity, and quick~’ned info another and better e\\istence. By its legend and all I k ritual it is implied that we have been redeemed froiii the death of ~iii and sepi~chr&of pollution !“—Mackey’s h’sfualist, p. 109. These and the I ik’c quotations might be continued to any extent and from different authors. But these will suffice to settle the question with all rational and in - telligent readers. And if once the ministry and churches of this country can be possessed of these facts, there will be raised to God one general cry; as when Pre~ident Lincoln called the American people to unite in prayer for deliverance frGm the curse of the slavery war. Deism is praetieal atheism. For Ihe infinite God cannot be reached by finite minds, but only through a merciful Mediator. But the key to the importance of this 32nd degree, is its MOTTO: “Ad majorem Dei gloria.m.” Note 370. This is the motto of the Jesuits; who, with the apostate Ramsay, made these French degrees, falsely called Scot - tish. This, motto was adopted by their founder, Igna - tiu.s Loyola; and is still the motto of the order which he founded, in an underground chapel of the Holy Martyrs in 1534, seventeen years after Luther nailed his Theses to the church door at Wittenberg, in 1517. The reforma - tion had only fairly begun, and this underground, sceret order of Jesuits met the Reformation, and has turned it back. Some principalities in Germany, once Protestant, are now undcr Popish princes! That order now rules Popedom, though once prohibited by it, as Masonry is now. The reader will find the above motto on page 14, of the introduction, and the founding of the order on page 9 of the “I! i.story of the Society of Jesus.” Baltimore, 1878. And on pages 12 and 13 he says, that in the village of Lasorta, near Rome, while praying, he was ‘dazzled by a brilliant light ;“ and “the entire history of the order,” says the historian, “is but a de - velopment of that vision.” Now, if that light had been from God, as was that which shone around Paul, at his conversion, Loyola’s life would have borne the same fruit which Paul’s did, instead of the ignorance, superstition, and persecution which has tracked Papacy ever since; and now fur - nishes saloon-keepers for our cities, and carries their votes to license pauperism, crime, blasphemy, and woe. But if that light was from Satan, who is Christ~s rival and counterfeit, then we should expect the fruits, which we see follow the Papacy everywhere. Then that super - natural light was Masonic light, whose fruits are the"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"458 “THSY SHALL BE ROOTED UP.” same.

We have not to avenge the murder of Hiram Abiff, for he represents that eternal wisdom, which ignorance and lust of power and false - hood had concealed from u~, but we must go on, in search of those laws by which the moral world is regulated. We have not persecuted the unfortunate nation of Judah, for having sentenced to death our beloved Sovereign, Jesus of Nazareth, the Apostle of the duties and rights of man, but we must crush forever supersti - tion, fanaticism and intolerance. They, and not the children of Israel were guilty. Let us show them no mercy, and thereby secure the blessings of liberty of conscience. Each child of God must worship his father, according to his own conscience and enjoy those prerogatives of the heart and mind of which God alone is the Supreme Judge. INITIATION. 477 We have not to avenge the murder of Jacques de Molay and the Templars, but we must never allow, if in our power to prevent it any living man to possess sufficient power to accomplish another such a crime. No man has a right to usurp a power which belongs to God alone. No man is above his brother, except by intellect, charity, good deeds and education. To no man has God given authority to replace and represent him on earth, and all those who pretend to be his ministers and representatives must not be believed. Our ignorance and selfishness alone give these usurp - ers the pow&, which they wield for the gratification of their impious schemes. Our order is instituted to stop such encroachment and to prevent the renewal of the tragedy which ended in the murder of those Knight Templars, whose virtues and moral power caused such terror to the political and religious usurpers of that age, which is ever presented to our minds by the battery of this degree: five, three, one and two; significant to Sovereign Grand Inspectors of the year of the murder of those victims of intolerance kingeraft and prlescraft, 5312. We abhor the doctrine which teaches the murder of kings and priests, but as long as the weakness of man - kind renders their usurpation unavoIdable, we must pre - vent their exercising their power to oppress uiankind and endeavor by degrees to enlighten our brother melt and prepare their minds for the enjoyment of those rights and privileges which our Heavenly Father has guaranteed to his heloved children.

The thirty-first degree gave us a ~‘Sovereign Tribunal;” and this second degree be3 oiid, gives us another, a “Supreme Von ncd,” whose jurIsdiction is to be fiumal and Universal in the world of Masonry. it is based (Note 395.) on Con - stitutions of 1786, which a Masonic French historian, Kioss, who knew, pronounces “the Grand Lie of the order!” (Folger’s Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, page 60, Doc.) But whether invented to furnish an - other degree, to sell; or to keep the supreme control in Charleston, S. C., it is all one. It is a brief apex to falsehood, fraud, and imposition. In previou.. degrees the Savior Is given no more exalted title than “the Master from Nazareth.” But in this degree, He is once called “our bclovcd Sovereign,” (page 476.) and once “our Puissant Sovereign. Jesus of Nazareth;” (page 477.) which phrases used in an ordinary lodge, would make the speaker liable to be rapped down. No Jew would use such words of Christ, unless moved by what caused that Jew to hail Him as his Master, and kiss Him in the warden, yiz., money. Those who glance through the ritual of the present"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"482 DENIES TIlE I~SP[RAT[ON OF THE BIBLE. FOUGHT LIKE WOLVES OVER A CARCASS. 483 ruling rite, falsely called “Scottish,” will see that thia thirty-third degree has been preceded by a degree, called, and intended to be, the last, or “ultimate” of Masonry; from the Master Mason’s or Ihird degree, up. This 33rd degree may continue to be “ultiinate~” till its framer, Albert Pike, dies; who is now, in 1888, seventy-nine years old. And it niay, indeed, prove to be “the last.” For the deluge of dark orders from tile niouth of the dragon, is a sign that the return of Chri~l is near. (Rev. 12, 12.) But if the accursed s~stelti etintinucs to vex the earth, and destroy souls, this rite of :l3rd degrees will fade out, and give way to other in ventions These degrees have been altered and added to, by Pike, who has translated the Zendavesta (page 439) as seen in the 32nd degree, of ~hieh this 33rd is a mere elongation, and filling out. No other Mason has ever translated the Zend, but Pike. In these last degrees of the rite, the drag-net. of antiquity is drawn over all the old, lost nations; and alt liemy, suii-worship, the worship of beasts and birds. trees, etc., arc given on pages 435-42, as the souree~ of the invstero s of Masonry. And the mysterics and svm - hols of the Bible, are drawn from these, instead of The holy Ghost, by ~vhom inspifed men “spa icc as they were moved.” (2 Pet. 1, ‘21.) And having thus denied the source of the Bible as coming from God, Pike pro- deeds to put the worship of ‘the black ox,” “ph~nix,” etc, etc., which has sunk Egypt from the list of nations; on a level with the worship of our Savior, Christ; in Europe and America! There arc his words: p. 443 “The great ends of N’Iasonry” arc, “to reconcile all rites, and make charitable judgrtient and toleration univcr~al ;“ * * * and in Ihe place of the smoking altar of fan - aticism and superstition, of bigotry and sectarianism, to set up those of true Masonry.” Etc., etc. ! This is ex - phicit: to thestroy Christianity, and make Masonry the religion of the Globe! This is not enough. He exeuses the Jews for murder. Ing our Savior, Christ; who is nothing but a Freneh “Apostle of the rights of man ;“ (page 477) and, on the next page, he declares: “To no man has God given the right to represent Him on earth ;“ not even the man Christ Jesus. And, on the same page: “We have not to reconquer, by murder and bloodshed, that land made holy by our Puissant Sovereign, Jesus of Nazareth.” Here he not only insults Christ by making Him a Ma - sonie “Puissant Sovereign,” but he justly brands the eonquest of Palestine, by the Crusaders, as “murder and bloodshed;” while this whole fabrie of the 33rd rite is professedly based on those very Crusades, and derives from them its honors, titles, and eclat! Surely, “whom the gods will destroy, they first make mad.” But the force of this 33rd degree by no means lies in the stupid quackery of its learning. In it “More is meant, than meets the eye.” Note 392 explains the object of this otherwise weak degree. It was made to reduce the governors of the Masonic world to ‘~nine” men, meeting in the little slave-holding city of Charleston, S. C., with Albert Pike for their “Sovereign Commander.” This was the world’s first Supreme Council, opened by Mitchell and Daleho, in 1801. But this 33rd degree, with Pike at its head, did not then exist; and it was weak and wavering. Twelve years later, i. e., in 1813, a “Supreme Council,” Northern Jurisdiction, was located in New York, and wolves never fought over a carcass more savagely, than these secret swindlers of the people quarreled over the spoils of lodgery. If the reader consults Folger’s Histor) of the Scottish Rite, from page 15 onward, he ~uhi see, and say, that the wolves, not the Masons, suf - fer by the comparison. While this fight between rival"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"N 484 SOUTHERN LODGES WORKED UP THE REBELLION. bodies in New York and Boston was raging, the slave. holders sprung this 33rd degree upon them. Its motto: “Deus ci Meumque Jus,” was Albert Pike’s, on hia sign at Washington, D. C., on hia Southern Jurisdiction building, near the Avenue; and as Note £93 atiys: “It claims jurisdiction over all the ineffable and sublime degrees.” And though made within the memory of men now living, we read, in the same Note by Macoy: “It is not certainly known, when or there this degree originated ;“ that is to say, ita origin is concealed. This is the most infamous Masonic act, next to burning their records of fifty-nine years before the war, to hide treason. But slavery then ruled the country, and this 33rd Charleston degree ruled the lodge. And the South - ern lodge-rooms worked up the most unjustifiable and infamous war on record. The Southern people were dragooned into it, by leaders secretly sworn to obey Masonic leaders, or have their throats cut. But that red sea of blood is crossed. And if the Amcriean ministry and churches can be rescued from the lodge-worships of Satan, the god of war; we shall take a long stride towards the~ Milleninm of “Peace on earth, and good wiII~ to men.” CONCLUSION. AMERICANS! We have spoken in faithfulness. Let us part in peace. No candid person can look, though slightly, over these pages, and not see: 1. That the notes, all taken from the highest Ma - sonic authorities, prove the truth of the ritual. 2.
