Doan’s Recommendation to appoint a special Code Revi sion Committee. The committee was asked to undertake a comprehens ive review of the California Masonic Code for inconsistencies and mistakes which have accumulated over time and to make recommendations for appropriate corrections and updates. It is helpful to understand the history of our Code when considering a revision of it. In the early years of our Grand Lodge, the written Masonic law of this jurisdiction was contained in a Constitution, a set of Bylaws which provided certain procedural rules for communications and a series of standing resolutions wh ich were adopted by the craft ove r the years to resolve issues which had arisen under the Constitution or Bylaws or to address issues where the Constitution and Bylaws were silent. These resolutions were published in the order adopted. Over time, it became difficult to find a resolution on point w ith the number which had accumulated. Past Grand Master John Stewart Ross, a lawyer from El Centro, undertook a re organization of these resolutions by grouping them by subject matter. Thus organized, they were published in 1931 with the Constitution and Bylaws in what would become known as the Ross Digest . In 1939, the Constitution was divided into the Constitution (lim ited to the so called “fundamental organic law of Grand Lodge”) and the Ordina nces (with the provisions of th e Constitution which were not considered “organic”). The Constitution and Ordinances were organized into 353 sections, followed by the accumulated interpretive resolutions organized by topic. Another comprehensive revision of our published law was made in 1956 with the publication of the first California Masonic Code . The standing resolutions and decisions in the Ross Digest were organized not by topic but by the Code secti on to which they related, and each was printed as an annotation under the appli cable section. Although the Code was subsequently revised in 1975 and 1991, the same organization of the Code continued, with some modifications for clarity. However, the law remain ed much as it had been in the Ross Digest : a Constitution with a series of special rules and exceptions in th e Ordinances. Other than the adoption of new commercialism rules in 1995, there has been no signi ficant attempt to put all rules on the same subject in the same area of the Code nor to a ddress issues which are not covered by the Code. There are many unwritten rules followed by custom in this jurisdiction which have never found their way into the Code. Your committee was asked by Grand Master Sorsabal to produce a draft restatement of the Code to address these deficiencies. As is now the ge neral state practice for co rporations, we propose a Constitution which looks like a set of corporate Arti cles of Incorporation: short with only the most pertinent rules of the organization incl uded. All other rules are proposed for the Ordinances. This reorganization allowed th e committee to place rules governing the same subject in one place and to elimin ate duplications found of the same rule in different parts of the Code. The Ordinances have been reorganized in an order which generally follows the order"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 found in corporate Bylaws. Within topic headings, rules have been included in the order in which the process addressed would be undertake n. Previously unwritten rules followed by custom have been included, and we have clar ified existing rules where custom has not been consistent with the prior published Code. We have included cross references. We have attempted to simplify complicated language, although as many of us on the committee are practicing or retired lawyers, simplicit y to us may not be simplicity to you. We have attempted to avoid changing the la w in doing this restatement, although because lawyers can argue over every comma it is impossi ble to say that the Code proposed may not on occasion produce a different result than would have been the case under our current Code. However, we do not believe that there have been any material changes, except as follows. We have eliminated some provisions which are obsol ete or should be dealt with somewhere other than in the Code. (The deleted provisions are se t forth in the Appendix to this report.) There are inconsistencies in the current C ode, and we have attempted to re tain what we felt were best practices. We have updated portions of the Code which were not consistent with state law, such as Grand Lodge’s relationship with the Masonic Homes, Ca lifornia Masonic Foundation and California Masonic Memorial Temple. There are some revisions in trial procedures, including the addition of a burden of proof. We believe that the result of our efforts is a draft Code which is easier to read, addresses more issues and hopefully will reduce the number of future disagreements as to what the Code requires. The appendix and source information for Code provisi ons are presented to assi st in the review of our proposal but are not part of the Code. The ta ble of contents, index an d cross-reference tables are not part of the Code and will be prepared after the Code is adopted. We thank the Grand Master for th e opportunity which he has given us to serve in this important assignment. Respectfully submitted, R. Stephen Doan (369), P.G.M., Chairman Jack R. Levitt (35), P.G.M. Ralph B. Dash (721) Richard A. Meyers (399) Maxwell S. “Mickey” Roth (351) John L. Cooper, III (467), Grand Secretary Action: Grand Master Sors abal recommended that the California Masonic Code be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in the Fourth Edition of the California Masonic Code attached to this report. His recommendation was adopted by th e required five-sixths vote. The Fourth Edition of the California Masonic Code therefore became effectiv e at the close of the 2006 Annual Communication on October 11, 2006.

Between Annual Communications of the Grand Lodge, it is the Grand Master’s responsibility to answer these questions by d eciding what the law means and how it applies to the circumstances at hand. A Gr and Master’s decision on the interpretation of the law and its application to a specific factual circumstance does not bind his successor. If a Grand Master wants to mandate that his successor always follow what was for him a discretionary act, then he must recommend and Grand Lodge must adopt an amendment to our Constitution and Ordinances to mandate the same result. When the Grand Master submits to Grand L odge for confirmation an interpretation of the law to which the Grand Master does not intend to bind his successors, a simple majority vote only is required to sustain the Grand Master’s ac tion. Such a decision cannot be recorded in the Grand Lodge Constitution and Ordinances because such a decision would not have been approved by the required vote. Instead, these Grand Masters’ decisions are listed in this appendix as permissible interp retations of the law only. They are not binding. They are recorded simply to preserve for future refe rence what Grand Lodge has on a prior occasion determined to be permissible interpre tations or applications of our law.

Investments of Grand Lodge and Its Entities (2002 G.M. Decision No. 5) The intent of the 1975 code should be followed when Section 7020 [of the 1991 Code] is read: pooling of assets belonging to two or more Grand Lodge en tities for investment purposes is authorized.

Decision No. 6) California Masons may engage in any activ ity with an unrecognized Mason so long as they do not share any portion of th e ritual which in this jurisdicti on is not monitorial. California Masons may do any of the following: 1. We may share facilities for tiled mee tings. Our Masonic Hall Associations may rent their facilities to Prince Hall an d any other group of unrecognized Masons just as our Masonic Hall Associations mi ght rent to any other tenant. By like measure, a California Lodge may rent sp ace from and hold its tiled meetings in facilities owned and operated by unrecognized Masons. The ritual is not shared when we simply share facilities. 2. In public Grand Lodge Ceremonies, unr ecognized Masons may participate to the fullest extent permitted Knights of Columbus and others, so long as the unrecognized Masons do not participate dur ing the performance of the ceremony as set forth in the Grand Lodge Book of Ceremonies . 3. We may participate with unrecognized Masons in public parades and other processions. 4.

"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 196 Interpretation of Section 804.205 and the California Ritual. Discussing Masonry with the Non-Mason (1993 G.M. Decision No. 2) Masonry has distinguished itself from other fraternal and service organizations by an important tradition: no man may be solicited or invited to become a Mason. An applicant for the degrees of Masonry must be motivated by a favor able impression of the fraternity. He must seek membership of his own free will and accord. While the tradition may be simply stated, its application in the real world has left even experienced Masons in doubt as to the propriety of discussing our fraternity with non-Masons for fear that our anti-solicita tion rule will be violated. Because our anti-solicitation rule is part of our traditions and not our California Masonic Co de, there is no place where the Mason can turn for help in understanding the boundaries of propriety in discu ssing Masonry with the non-Mason. It is hoped that this decision will provide guidance in this area. Although the origin of our prohibition on solicitation is unknown, it has been widely misinterpreted by well-meaning Masons. It ha s been carried to extremes when a member refrains from discussing the fraternity with an in terested prospective member. This attitude is far more prevalent than we like to admit and ha s undoubtedly deterred many good men from joining our fraternity. There is a distinct difference between soli citation and information. Solicitation is the active and persistent attempt to influence someb ody to do something. It can involve the use of pressure or promises of certain favors. This approach to a prospective member is certainly unacceptable to the Masonic fraternity. On the other hand, a man of character will not join an organization of which he has little or no knowledge. If he is unfamiliar with the de tails of Masonic membership, there is little chance that he will be interested until he has been exposed to some information, through friends or relatives. Offering info rmation is not solicitation. A member may provide information on the purp oses and principles of Freemasonry to an interested inquirer. He may fr eely answer questions about the organization of the fraternity, membership requirements, financial obliga tions, expectations of members, personal development, charities, community service, fa mily activities and many other subjects which would help a prospective member decide whether he wishes to apply for membership of his own free will and accord. A member may not discuss th e ritual of the degrees of Masonry with the prospective member, except to explain that th e ceremonies contain serious lessons which are highly regarded by Masons. Any further explana tion would diminish the impact of the degrees on the candidate. Masons may sponsor programs to explain what Masonry is and invite non-Masons to the program in an attempt to create a favorable impression toward the fraternity. Our Masonic"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 Information programs in California have been us ed successfully by our L odges to create such a favorable impression without crossing the li ne separating information from solicitation. A member may ask a man whom he believes to be a worthy prospective Mason if he has considered membership in the Masonic fraternity or if he would like to have information to enable him to make such a decision. A member must inform the prospective member or inquirer that the fraternity does not extend an invitation to become a member, that his application must be made of his own free will and accord, and that he must pass a secret ballot for admission. After providing the information, the inquirer or prospect should be left to make his own decision without persuasion. If the inquirer ma kes no decision within a reasonable time, the member may make a single follow-up contact to see if additional in formation is needed. Great care should be taken when a Mason approaches a non-Mason under circumstances which might imply some coercion or intimidation. For example, a supervisor at work should be very careful when approaching a subordinate. An older family member should be very careful when approaching a younger family member. Under no circumstance should a prospective member be led to believe that ce rtain favors or benefits will resu lt from his membership, except that he may be made aware of the program of care provided for elderly members and their spouses through our Masonic Homes, if their conditions eventually warrant such care. All communications with a prospective me mber should be courteous and friendly. Information about the fraternity should be factual. If questions cannot be answered adequately, the member should seek assistance from other members. Interpretation of Sections 804.235, 804.310, 804.320 and 804.740 of the California Masonic Code.

While Section 26120 of the [1991] Code may make optional the requirem ent of “due inquiry” into the character of an applicant for affiliatio n, it does not alter the requirement of “previous notice.” If a petition for affiliation is read and voted upon at the same Stated Meeting, it fails to fulfill the requirement of “previous notice”.

Decision No. 5) (as modified by 1996 G.M. Decision No. 3 and Recommendation No. 1) Guidelines Applicable to Masonic Lodges . Our California Masonic Code permits Mas onic Lodges to accept advertising in Lodge publications under limited circumstances. These Gu idelines answer many of the questions which may arise in connection with that advertising. If a question arises which is not adequately answered by these Guidelines, Section 27600 of the [1991] California Ma sonic Code should be consulted. If questions remain, then the Gr and Lodge Committee on Jurisprudence should be contacted. A Masonic Lodge may permit advertising only in Lodge publications. This includes any publication which the Lodge uses to communicat e with its members. A Masonic Lodge may therefore accept advertising for its monthly bulle tin or trestleboard. It may also accept advertising for its Lodge Roster and installation programs. It may not accept advertising which will not be printed in a Lodge publication. For example, commercial advertising material cannot be posted in the Masonic hall. Except as noted below, advertising may be accepted only from the Lodge’s members and from businesses or commercial establishments ow ned or operated by its members. Advertising may not be accepted from members of another Lodge. Advertising may not be accepted from the wife or other relatives of a member. Adve rtising may be accepted from a business only if a member of the Lodge has an equi ty or other ownership interest in the busine ss or holds an operating or managing position in the business. If the publication is jointly sponsored with another Lodge or with the Eastern Star, York Rite or other Masonic Organizations, advert ising may be accepted only from a sponsor’s members and from businesses or commercial esta blishments owned or operated by a sponsor’s members. If the Masonic groups meeting in a Mas onic hall mail a joint bulletin to all of their"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 200 members, all of those members and their businesse s may publish advertisements in the bulletin. Again, advertising may not be accepted from a member’s wife or othe r relatives who are not themselves members of at least one of the sponsoring organizations. Advertising may be accepted from a business only if a member of a spons or has an equity or other ownership interest in the business or holds an operating or managing position in the business. The advertising must be in good taste and within the bounds of propriety. While “good taste” is difficult to define, nothing should be accepted which would offend accepted standards of behavior among Masons. If a matter would be inappropriate for di scussion at a Masonic social gathering where wives, families and friends are present, it should not be part of an advertisement in a Lodge publication. This standa rd applies to the size and subject matter of the advertisement as well as to its text, art work an d color. Sexual inferences and vulgarity would not be acceptable. Neither the advertising itsel f nor the products or services which it promotes may be unethical, fraudulent, misleading or illegal under applicable state and federal laws. Advertisements may not be accepted for prescription drugs and other controlled substances. Advertisements may not be accepted for alcoholic or tobacco products. Advertisements for religious or pol itical groups may not be accepted. Neither the Lodge’s mailing list nor the Grand Lodge Roster may be furnished to advertisers, either directly or in directly. Even if the advertiser offers to mail the publication as a service to the Lodge, the Lodge’s mailing list may not be delivered to an advertiser for any purpose. No one may tell a Mason that it is his duty to advertise in the L odge’s publication. No pressure, either directly or indirectly, may be applied to any member to advertise in a Lodge publication. Keep in mind that pressure can be applied by what we say as well as by the implications of what we do. Solicitation of advertisements may be ma de only by a member in good standing of the Lodge for whose publication adver tising is solicited. The Lodge may not employ anyone, either directly or indirectly, to solicit advertising, unless the ma n is a Mason in good standing of the Lodge for whose publication adve rtising is solicited. A member of another Lodge may not solicit advertising.

The acceptance of advertising in a Masonic publication for a gambling enterprise (whether a legal or an illegal gambling enterpri se) gives the aid and coun tenance of Masonry to that enterprise. Because the rece ipts of that gambling enterprise would pay for the advertising, the conduct of that gambling enterprise has provided a monetary benefit to the Masonic publisher. Accordingly, a Lodge may not accept a dvertising in its publications from an gambling enterprise.  Guidelines Applicable to Masonic Organizations . The foregoing Guidelines apply only to Masonic Lodges and to joint Masonic publications in which they participate. They do not apply to the Scottish Rite, the York Rite bodies, the Shrine, Eastern Star or any other prerequisite organiza tion. The advertising rules for these organizations may be found in S ections 27700 and 27800 of the [1991] Code. Neither the advertising itsel f nor the products or services which it promotes may be unethical, fraudulent, misleading or illegal under a pplicable state and federal laws. Because we are all concerned about the public’s perception of the Masonic Family, all advertising accepted by Masonic Organizations should be in good taste and within the bounds of propriety. Subject to these restrictions , Masonic Organizations may acc ept advertising from anyone. When the advertising proceeds will be retained by the sponsoring organization and will not be given to charity, the square and compass, the words “Mason”, “Masonic”, “Freemasonry”, “Freemason” and any variation of any such words may not be used in connection with any advertising solicitation. Such adve rtising may not be solicited at Lodge. If the proceeds from the advertising will be donated to charity, then thes e restrictions do not apply. In any event, all advertising solicitation must state whether the pr oceeds will be used for fraternal purposes or given to charity.

Decision No. 1) For purposes of the limitations on advertisi ng, the term ‘Lodge publications’ includes the publication of a Masonic Hall Association or a Masonic Organization when the publication is used by a Masonic Lodge to communicate with its members.

Decision No. 4) Lodges in our jurisdiction may not hold member ships in programs offered by tax-exempt foundations in other jurisdictions in orde r to raise funds for community projects. Interpretation of Section 809.560 of the California Masonic Code. Use of Lodge Funds to Pay Du es in Community Organizations (1996 G.M. Decision No. 2) Section 21090 of the [1991] Code permits a Lodge to expend not more than thirty percent of its total revenue for the purpos es of refreshments and the prom otion of fraternal intercourse, including community improvement. A Lodge ma y therefore become a member of the local Chamber of Commerce and pay the associated due s. Use of Lodge funds to pay Chamber of Commerce dues involves “community improvement , charitable activity, or sponsorship of programs that will benefit residents of the co mmunity in which the L odge is located” as permitted by Section 21090 of the [1991] Code. However, a Chamber of Commerce member ship is different from a service club membership. Even if the membership could be taken in the name of th e Lodge, a service club membership is more beneficial to the member of the Lodge participating in the club’s meetings while a Chamber of Commerce membership is more beneficial to the Lodge. The support for the community which Chamber membership implies would be the primary purpose for belonging, rather than the contacts which those participating in it might receive. Ther e is also a significant cost difference between the two memberships. Therefore, Lodge funds may not be expended to pay the service club dues of members of the Lodge.

Guidelines for Use of Alcoholic Beverages by Masonic Lodges and Masonic Organizations (1995 G.M. Recommendation No. 5) Questions frequently arise with respect to permissible use of al coholic beverages in Lodge halls, on other property owned by or leased to a Masonic body and at Masonic activities held elsewhere. These guidelines explain the Gra nd Lodge rules applicable to such use. These guidelines apply to Lodges, Hall Associations, the Scottish R ite, the York Rite bodies, the Shrine, Eastern Star and all ot her prerequisite organizations and their Hall Associations. These guidelines address only the policy and regulations of the Grand Lodge. Your use of alcoholic beverages also must comply with the applicable laws of the State of California and the rules established by your Masonic Hall Association or other landlord. A Masonic Lodge, Hall Association and othe r Masonic Organization may allow alcoholic beverages to be served on Masonic property to their members and invited guests, with one exception. Alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the room where a Lodge or a Masonic Organization meets unless that room is also th e regular social hall. Lodges, Hall Associations and other Mas onic Organizations may maintain a bar on Masonic property so long as al coholic beverages are not regularly or permanently stored in the bar. Alcohol should not be stored elsewhere on Masonic property either. Lodges and Hall Associations may not us e funds from the Lodge’s or the Hall Association’s treasury to purchase alcoholic beverages. However, funds collected by a committee of the Lodge for social purposes are not Lodge funds. Therefore, if a committee of the Lodge plans a Lodge activity where alcoholic beverages are served, the committee may use the money collected from ticket sales to purchase alcoholic beverages. Th e excess ticket sale proceeds may not be given to the Lodge until after the reimbursement has been made. No Lodge or Hall Association funds may be used to re imburse anyone who has purchased alcoholic beverages. These restrictions apply only to Lodges and Hall Associations. The Scottish Rite, the York Rite bodies, the Shrine, Eastern Star and other Masonic Organizations may reimburse the purchase of alcoholic beverages from their tr easuries, if their re gulations so permit. Alcoholic beverages may not be served, consum ed, or sold during the course of a meeting of a Masonic Lodge, Hall Association, or Masoni c Organization. Any alcoholic beverages must be removed from the meeting room prior to be ginning the meeting. The meeting may be opened and called to refreshment, after which alcoholi c beverages may be served, but the alcoholic beverages must be removed from the meeti ng room prior to calling back to labor. Lodges and Masonic Organizations may hold tiled meetings and social events on non- Masonic properties where there is a permanent bar, such as a hotel or rest aurant, provided that no alcoholic beverages are present during any meeting. Any bar loca ted elsewhere in the building may remain open during the meeting."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 204 Licensed caterers are permitted to serve a nd sell alcoholic beverages at all Masonic events held by any Lodge, Hall Association or Ma sonic Organization on or away from Masonic property, if all applicable California laws are followed. No Lodge or Hall Association may directly or indirectly apply for, assume title to or operate under any governmental license or perm it for the purpose of consuming, serving or selling alcoholic beverages, whet her in, on or away from premis es owned, leased or rented by a Masonic Lodge or Hall Association. Therefore, if alc oholic beverages are not sold an d served by a licensed caterer, there are cert ain restrictions on the event wh ich must be observed because the event has not been licensed. As a general rule, no license or permit is required if alcoholic beverages are not sold and the premises are not open to the general public when alcoholic beverages are being served or consumed. ● If alcoholic beverages cannot be sold, you cannot have a cash bar or sell drink tickets or tokens to be exchanged for alcoholic beverage s. You may charge for the meal or other event at which alcoholic beverages are serve d, so long as everyone pays the same price, regardless of whether they will be served an alcoholic beverage. Alternatively, members and guests may bring their own alcohol if alcoholic beverages are not sold. ● Under no circumstances may the general public be present when al coholic beverages are served without a license. You may not advertise to the general public an event at which alcoholic beverages will be served on Ma sonic property. Only members of the sponsoring Masonic body and th eir invited guests may be in attendance when alcoholic beverages are served on Masonic property by someone other than a licensed caterer. The term “general public” does not include the members of the organization, their families or friends. If alcoholic beverages are not sold a nd served by a licensed caterer, Masonic Organizations are subject to thes e same restrictions unless the group is properly licensed by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Cont rol. This may include a single event license as well as a permanent club license. Masonic Organizations, such as the Scottish Rite, the York Rite bodies, the Shrine and Eastern Star, may hold such li censes even though a Lodge and Hall Association may not. Lodges, Hall Associations and other Masoni c Organizations may rent or lease their land or buildings to business establishm ents which serve and sell alcohol ic beverages as an incidental part of their businesses. For example, you may rent to a restaurant wh ich has a bar or to a grocery store that sells alcoholic beverages. However, you may not rent to a ba r business or a liquor store, even those bars a nd liquor stores with incidental sales of non-alcoholic products. Lodges, Hall Associations and other Masoni c Organizations may rent or lease their land or buildings to non-Masonic tenants other than business establishments who serve and sell alcoholic beverages, if the spons or or caterer is pr operly licensed by the Ca lifornia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.

Advertising for Gambling Establis hments in Masonic Publications (1996 G.M. Decision No. 3) The acceptance of advertising in a Masonic publication for a gambling enterprise (whether a legal or an illegal gambling enterpri se) gives the aid and coun tenance of Masonry to that enterprise. Because the rece ipts of that gambling enterprise would pay for the advertising, the conduct of that gambling enterprise has provided a monetary benefit to the Masonic publisher. Accordingly, neither a Lodge nor a Masonic Organization may accept advertising in its publications from a gambling enterprise. Interpretation of Section 812.040 of the California Masonic Code.
