It is not intended to be a book of laws to govern your actions, but a guide that you may use over the years to assist you during your journey through “the line.” It will be helpful to future incoming officers, if during your journey, you include ideas, suggestions, or any bit of information that will help him during his term in office. If all who fill these offices offer bits of information learned during their terms, it will ultimately help all of the officers of your lodge become more effective leaders and the lodge much stronger. Information that could benefit an upcoming brother could be: * Contact persons for services or products * Where to locate items for lodge activities or projects * Procedures that make certain tasks easier * Mistakes you made and the results from those mistakes * Any bit of information that will benefit future officers in the performance of their duties and a successful term in office. Any addition to the information in this book will indicate your successful term in office and your desire to see your upcoming brothers enjoy a more successful term in office. Use this book as it is intended. Don’t let it lay around to gather dust. This book could be a very worthwhile tool to future officers."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\u0018\u0018\u0018 Preface In the year of the Great Architect 2003, it was the vision of your Grand Lodge Committee on Masonic Education to provide every officer in the lodge a guide to their officer specific duties for the ensuing year. This handbook has been created to assist you with those officer specific duties. Some of the duties contained within these pages, with the exception of “The Code Duties,” are of a generic nature. As you progress through the line of officers in your lodge, your duties and responsibilities will change. Ultimately, the further you advance, the more you will have. As your duties and responsibilities increase, so does the time it takes to perform them. Different lodges may vary with officer specific duties. In travelling, you may very well notice differences in officer’s duties from one lodge to another. These duties are intended to prepare you for the next step until you have, with the blessing of your lodge brothers, been elected as master of your lodge. Your attention to detail and the performance of your duties will reflect upon you as an officer, as well as your lodge. It is very important that you take pride in the performance of your duties and perform them to the best of your ability."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"\u0018\t Off\u0018cers\tHandbook Duties of a Freemason By The Code “The Code” refers to: The Code, Constitution and Regulations of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina ” Reg. 52-3 The duties of a Freemason are as follows: 1.

The marshal will now invest you with the implement of your office. As the sword is placed in the hands of the tyler to enable him effectually to guard against the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, and suffer none to pass or repass, but such as are duly qualified. So it should morally serve as a constant admonition to us; to set a guard at the entrance of our thoughts, to place a watch at the door of our lips, to post a sentinel at the avenues of our actions, thereby excluding every unqualified and unworthy thought, word, and deed, and preserving consciences void of offense toward God and man.

It is important that you understand the duties and responsibilities of the office you now occupy. By accepting this appointment, you have indicated your desire to begin your journey through the line of officers, also known as “the chairs.” At this point, you have demonstrated the commitment needed to see this journey to its ultimate end, the East. It is important for you to understand this commitment and what it means. If you continue through the chairs, you will need to participate, as much as possible, in most of the lodge activities. Your participation will serve several purposes. It will demonstrate your desire to help make your lodge as successful as possible. Your participation will serve as a learning experience. It will help prepare you for future offices. Above all, if you do not participate, you will miss out on the friendship, camaraderie, and self-satisfaction of being a part of a very successful activity. In the not so distant future, you may be asked to handle a project or perform a task that will require the help of your fellow officers or brothers. If you have demonstrated in the past that you are willing to be there when they need you, you will find them there when you need them. Think of your journey through the chairs not as a task or job, but as a learning experience that will serve you in the lodge as well in life.

This office carries much responsibility. You are basically, the “keeper of the gate.” It is your responsibility to assist the tyler, before the lodge is purged, to vouch for visiting brethren. If you cannot, it is your responsibility to advise the master and/or wardens so that proper examination of the visitor may be initialized. It is your duty to guard the lodge entrance from within the lodge. No one should enter or leave the lodge without the master’s permission or order. It is your duty to assist the senior deacon in purging the lodge according to the rules and regulations in The Code . You are responsible for seeing that all that enter the lodge are properly clothed. Your office is of such importance that when you are performing other various duties in the lodge, the master must appoint another master mason to fill your chair during the performance of those duties. You are, in essence, “the guard within.” The Grand Lodge education booklet Program for Progress notes that “You are already a leader.” In the performance of your duties in previous chairs, you have demonstrated leadership qualities to varying degrees. Take the opportunity this year to hone and polish those leadership skills. Your participation and attendance at the lodge social events, projects, and fund raisers are good tools for sharpening your leadership skills. The lessons they teach and the experience you gain will benefit you throughout your journey through the chairs and in life itself.

The Holy Writings, that Great Light in Masonry, will guide you to all truth; it will direct your path to the temple of happiness, and point out to you the whole duty of man. However men may differ in creed, yet all men agree that within the pages of the Holy Bible are found those principles which lay the foundation upon which to build a righteous life. Freemasonry would take all men by the hand and, leading them to its altar, would point to the open Bible and urge each faithfully to direct his steps through life by the light he shall find therein. If, from our sacred altar, the atheist or irreligious man should ever wrest this book and thus remove, or even obscure, the Great Light of Freemasonry, that light which has been for centuries the rule and guide of all masons, then we could no longer claim the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"\u0018\u0018\t Off\u0018cers\tHandbook proud title and rank of master mason. As long as that sacred light shines upon our altar, as long as it illumines and brightens the pathway of the craftsman by the golden rays of truth; so long will Freemasonry live and shed its beneficent influence among men. Guard, then, my brother, this sacred book as you guard your life. Defend it as you would defend the flag of your country. Live according to its sublime precepts; govern yourself that you may be able to govern others; learn first that you may be able to teach; for justice, moderation, and decorum should mark the acts of an upright man. The square teaches us to regulate our actions by rule and line, and harmonize our conduct by the principle of morality and virtue. The compasses teach us to limit our desires in every station; that, rising to eminence by merit, we may live respected and die regretted. The rule directs that we should punctually observe our duty, press forward in the path of virtue, and, neither inclining to the right nor to the left, in all our actions have eternity in view. The line teaches the criterion of moral rectitude, to avoid dissimilation in conversation and action, and to direct our steps to the path which leads to a glorious immortality. You were then conducted to the East where you were handed your master’s cover and told: It is fitting that you should be covered when presiding over the lodge. Worshipful Master, I now place in your hands the gavel, an additional insignia of your rank and authority. Wield it, my brother, with prudence and discretion – firmly, but never arbitrarily – to the end that good order and harmony may be preserved. You were then presented the charter and told: Worshipful Master, I now present to you the charter of (insert your lodge name here), and charge you that you must preserve it with unfailing care and deliver it to your successor in office. The installing officer then read: The Book Of Constitutions and the By-Laws of your lodge you are to search at all times. Cause them to be read in your lodge that none may pretend ignorance of their excellent precepts. The installing officer then presented the charge to you: Worshipful Master, being selected master of this lodge, you cannot be insensible of the obligations which devolve on you as their head, nor of your responsibility for the faithful discharge of the important duties annexed to your election. The honor, reputation, and usefulness of your lodge will materially depend on the skill and devotion with which you manage its concerns, while the happiness of its members will be generally promoted in proportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the genuine principles of our institution."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Officers Handbook 1\u0018 For a pattern of imitation, consider the great luminary of nature, which, rising in the east, regularly diffuses the light and lustre to all within its circle. In like manner, it is your province to spread and communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your lodge. Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high importance of Masonry. Seriously admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to practice out of this lodge those duties which are taught in it. By amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct, they will convince mankind of the goodness of the institution, so that, when anyone is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows, to whom distress may prefer its suit, whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart expanded by benevolence. In short, by a diligent observance of the by-laws of your lodge, the constitutions of Masonry, and above all, the Holy Scriptures, which are given as a rule and guide to your faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with honor and reputation, and lay up a crown of rejoicing, which shall continue when time shall be no more.

But our jealousy is not of the master but for the lodge we have loved and served. We want to see her succeed, go forward, grow bigger, better, finer, more useful to our brethren. Most of us count no personal sacrifice comparable to the good of the lodge; most of us will go to great lengths to serve again in any capacity, if by so doing we can help the old lodge another mile forward on what we hope will be always an honorable path to glory. Therefore, worshipful sir, use us, we who have had our little hour in the East. We have experience – make it count for you. We have learned to work – make us work for you. We have understanding of lodge and membership problems – make it yours. Give us a job to do, a committee membership, a minor appointment; aye, give us the hard and unwanted jobs, and most of us will jump at the chance. And if you are reasonably gentle about it, and treat us with even a modicum of fraternal courtesy – such as the young should always offer the old! – some day we will welcome you as immediate past master and make you one of the charmed circle without which no lodge can function at its best.
