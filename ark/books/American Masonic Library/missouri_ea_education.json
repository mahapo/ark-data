In Missouri, seven members of the lodge who are Master Masons, and qualified to vote, are required to be present to enable a lodge to “open” and to conduct business. Authority is conferred by a Charter. The Charter of your lodge was issued by The Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Missouri. A Lodge retains its Charter as long as it obeys the laws of the Grand Lodge. LODGE OFFICERS Each Lodge should have twelve officers. They are Master, its chief executive; Senior and Junior Wardens, the second and third in order of rank; Treasurer; Secretary; Chaplain; Marshal; Senior and Junior Deacons; Senior and Junior Stewards; and Tiler. The Tiler always remains outside the door when the Lodge is in session. The first five officers are elected each year by written ballot The other officers are appointed by the Master. THE MEANING OF THE TERM “ENTERED APPRENTICE” Because you have received the First Degree Initiation you are now known as an Entered Apprentice. The word “apprentice” means “learner” or “beginner.” THE CANDIDATE MUST FIRST BE PREPARED IN HIS HEART Symbolically, the heart is the seat of the affections, passions, and desires. As a man’s heart is, so will his life be Freemasonry’s first concern is with the strengthening of character in the individual. DULY AND TRULY PREPARED Your wearing of special garments during initiation was symbolic. In part, it emphasized the concern of Freemasonry with a man’s internal worth, rather than with his external adornments. 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE HOODWINK The Hoodwink demonstrates that the sightless individual needs a guide, and symbolizes our dependence upon moral teachings for guidance in our daily conduct. The darkness of the Hoodwink is replaced by the light of understanding when the candidate begins to discover the mysteries of Freemasonry. THE CABLE-TOW The Cable-Tow, a cord worn by the candidate, is symbolic of our tie to the world outside of the Lodge. If the candidate chooses not to proceed he may leave this symbolic universe of Freemasonry by being led out by the Cable-Tow. THE HOLY SAINTS JOHN Freemasonry long ago chose as its patron saints,” John the Baptist and John the Evangelist. By this tradition, all Lodges symbolically came from a Lodge at Jerusalem. THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER Why is the Master, who is the presiding officer of the Lodge, addressed Worshipful? This is an old English word meaning “worthy of respect.” Since he is chosen by the Brethren, they deem him to have sufficient wisdom, integrity, and Masonic knowledge to govern the Lodge properly. Why is the Master’s station in the East? In the world of nature, the sun rises in the East to shed light and luster on the earth. In like manner, it is the province of the Master to be the source of Masonic knowledge for his Brethren, as they ‘‘approach the East in search of light.’’ Why does the Master wear a hat in Lodge? Keeping the head covered while others are uncovered has long been a symbol of superior rank. Men usually uncover in the presence of those they deem to be of superior rank as a mark of respect. THE HOLY BIBLE, SQUARE, AND COMPASSES The Holy Bible is the Volume of Sacred Law used by the Grand Lodges of the United States. In Missouri, the candidate is entitled to have his own sacred book substituted for the Bible. The Square is a symbol of morality. The Compasses are a symbol of restraint and knowledge. The Square and Compasses are seen and recognized by the general public as the symbol of Freemasonry. Only after receiving the third degree (Master Mason Degree) is a Freemason entitled to wear the Square and Compasses. 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In Missouri, no Regular Lodge may stand officially open unless the Holy Bible, the Torah, the Koran, or similar Holy Writings are present on its altar with the Square and Compasses displayed thereon. THE OBLIGATION The Obligation is the heart of the Degree. The taking of the Obligation is visible and audible evidence of the candidate’s sincerity of purpose. The candidate should understand that the great truths which Freemasonry teaches are not secret, but the manner in which Freemasonry teaches these truths is considered private. PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF THE OBLIGATION The Mason who violates his Obligation will subject himself to Masonic discipline, which could include the loss of membership in the Lodge and the Fraternity. The ancient penalties are retained in our ritual to impress symbolically upon the mind of each Brother how seriously a violation will be regarded by the members of the Fraternity. THE APRON The Apron has been used since ancient times as an honorary badge of distinction. Both the symbolic material—lambskin—and the color of the Apron— white—make it an emblem of innocence and purity. When the Apron is presented to the candidate, it is described as being “more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle, more honorable than the Star and Garter.... A LESSON IN CHARITY Having been divested of all metallic substances at the proper time, you have been taught a lesson in Charity. This lesson not only charges us to give monetary relief, but also to give thought and time to the aid of others. THE NORTHEAST CORNER The northeast corner is the traditional location of the cornerstone of a building. It is traditionally the first stone laid during construction. The Entered Apprentice is placed in the northeast corner of the Lodge to signify that he has begun his Masonic life. THE WORKING TOOLS The Working Tools presented to an Entered Apprentice are the 24-Inch Gauge, and the Common Gavel. These Working tools were used by ancient operative craftsmen. To the Freemason, the 24-Inch Gauge is a symbol of time 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"and its allotment, while the Common Gavel symbolically enables us to shape our Masonic life. THE CHARGE At the end of the ceremony of initiation, the candidate is charged to perform his Masonic duties. KING SOLOMON’S TEMPLE The frequent references to King Solomon’s Temple could lead to the conclusion that the Fraternity was founded by him. Freemasonry became an organized craft many years after the reign of Solomon. However, our ritual is based upon legends connected with both Solomon and the Temple at Jerusalem, which has helped enrich the symbolism. THE ORIGIN OF OUR RITUAL Where and when did the Ritual work originate? The father of the English Ritual was, undoubtedly, William Preston This Ritual has been refined and polished, without being basically changed in character, since the 18th century. THE LANGUAGE OF FREEMASONRY Why is the language of Freemasonry so different from that which we normally use 9 The Ritual of Freemasonry is a product of the early decades of the 18th century. It contains much of the language of that century. Other words and phrases from the very old work have also been incorporated. This is why the language is written and spoken as it is. WHEN TO RISE AND WHEN TO BE SEATED The gavel in the hands of the Master of a Lodge is one of the symbols of authority by which he governs. There are some exceptions, but in general when the gavel is sounded once in the East at the beginning of Lodge, the Brethren must come to order. Two raps call the Officers to their feet, and three raps mean that all the Brethren should stand. If everyone is standing, one rap seats everyone in the Lodge. If the Master addresses you by name, arise and listen to his instructions. If you wish to speak, arise and wait until the Master recognizes you, then address remarks to him. THE TILER A Lodge is said to be duly tiled when the necessary precautions have been taken to guard against intrusion by cowans, eavesdroppers, or other unauthorized persons. 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A cowan is one who tries to masquerade as a Freemason. He is one who has not done the work, but says he has, in order to gain admittance. An eavesdropper is one who tries to steal the secrets of our Society. If a Brother comes to Lodge late, the Tiler sees that he is properly clothed, and then vouches for him as qualified to enter. It is the duty of the Tiler to inform the Junior Deacon when a qualified Brother wishes to enter the Lodge. LODGE PRAYERS No Lodge should be opened, or closed, without prayer—which is offered by the Chaplain. At the end of the prayer, each member responds with the words “So mote it be.” THE RIGHTS OF AN ENTERED APPRENTICE An Entered Apprentice has limited privileges. He is not required to pay dues, cannot vote or hold office, can attend Lodge during the Entered Apprentice degree, and can receive a Masonic Funeral Service.
