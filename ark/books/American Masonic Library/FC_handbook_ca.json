This handbook should be studied ca refully, as it outlines many of the things associated with this degree in order to help each Mason better understand it. There are various ways that the meaning of th e Fellow Craft degree and its place between the first and third degrees of Masonry have been explained. In one sense, the Fellow Craft degree symbolizes the stage of adulthood and respons ibility during a man’s life on earth, following youth and preceding old age. In this stage, the man’ s task is to acquire knowledge and apply it to the building of his character and improving the society in which he lives. As the father of our Masonic lectures, William Preston saw Masonry as a means to educate men in the liberal arts and sciences in order to bette r mankind. A Fellow Craft Mason is urged to advance his education in these fields during the ritual of this degree. Some view the three-degree system of Ancien t Craft Masonry as repr esenting a progressive teaching directed toward perfecti ng human nature. It is a view of human nature divided into the three parts of body, mind, and soul. In this view , each degree addresses and instructs one part. The first degree encompasses the body and the facu lties of action. The four cardinal virtues are extolled as the proper guides to action in the wo rld that we may perfect our relation to it. The second degree addresses the mind and its faculties. The candidate is instructed in the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, which were formulated hundreds of year s ago in order to develop and perfect the mental nature in preparation for comprehending sp iritual truth. The third degree confers the central mystery of Freemasonry, relati ng to the soul. The Fellow Craft Degree SYMBOLISM OF THE DEGREE The symbolism of the Entered Apprentice degree emphasizes beginnings, spiritual birth, the first steps, youth, and orientation to the Light, which are all consistent with an initiation into the fraternity. The second degree of Fellow Craf t symbolizes the methods of developing and progressing in the Craft and, in a sense, the emergence into spiritual manhood and maturity. Therefore, we find symbols of advancement, passage, instructi on, and elevation throughout this degree. We find symbolism of taking the next step and a new way of approaching the east. What was considered in the last degr ee to be our weaker nature ha s now been squared and elevated. While keeping our fidelity to The Three Grea t Lights, we deepen our connection with the fraternity and take on new commitments. Our working tools are now applicable. With them we try, square, and prove. With them we learn to develop the faculty of judgement: what is valuable, what is true, what is real. The central motif of this degree being one of advancement, we ar e presented with the symbol of the Winding Staircase, consisting of so many st eps and leading to the Middle Chamber of the temple. Staircases, ladders, extended vertical r opes, and mountains are all symbols of ascending to new heights."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 Gaining entrance to a new place symbolizes a distinct advancement in our work as Freemasons. Attaining this level gives us access to certain benef its that we were not entitled to before. These benefits are symbolized by corn, wine, and oil. Th ere are other things granted here as well. We become invested with the ability to hear the teach ings of our fraternity and keep them close to our heart. Finally, we are reminded of our central focus in the symbolism of the letter “G” and the humility it should inspire. DULY AND TRULY PREPARED At the outset of this degree, it should be clear to the candidate that a lthough much of it seems familiar, it is also very different, and some aspects even seem to be in opposition to the previous degree. There are certain avenues of further expl oration that should be brought out here. We are usually given an explanation for most parts of th e ritual in the various lectures. Some seem to allude to deeper interpretations. As we study th e mysteries of Freemasonr y, certain things should be kept in mind. For example, the number thr ee keeps emerging in the rituals in one way or another. Geometrically, three is th e triangle. And, in fact, there ar e three kinds of triangles: the equilateral triangle (all three sides equal), the is osceles triangle (two side s equal), and the scalene triangle (no sides equal). Many of the mythological gods or heroes that were smiths or artificer s for the gods were lame, for example, the Roman god Vulcan and the Gree k god Hephaestus. Vulcan was crippled as a result of being thrown down to earth. He is usua lly depicted with tools, as he is a patron of craftsmen. Scalene in one sense means unequal and used in another way means limping. The most celebrated scalene triangle is , of course, the 3-4-5 right triangle, which is of special concern to Freemasons. This is explored more in the Master Mason degree. THE PREPARATION The changes in dress from an Entered Appren tice Mason to a Fellow Craft Mason have been explained in the ceremony. Gaining admission is sim ilar to the first degree, with the addition of a pass, which is given for him by his conductor. We are trying to teach that the knowledge and energy are freely given toward gaining the privil eges of Freemasonry, and that by the aid of others, we are able to advance. THE JEWELS The attentive ear, the instructive tongue, and th e faithful breast remind the craftsman that the time-honored method of instruction is by word of mouth. These jewels should signify the necessity to learn and use good Ma sonic instruction, and develop a devotion to the teachings of the Craft. THE SQUARE The square is the symbol of morality, truthfulne ss, and honesty. The direction of the two sides of the square form an angle of 90°, or a right angle, so called because this is the angle which stones must have if they are to be used to build a st able and upright wall. It symbolizes accuracy, not even varying by a single degree. When we part u pon the square, we go in different directions, but in full knowledge that our courses in life will be going according to the angle of the square (which means in the right direction), until we meet again."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 THE LEVEL The level is a symbol of equali ty. Each person is endowed with a worth and dignity which is spiritual, and should not be subj ect to man-made distinctions. Masonry recognizes that one man may have greater potential in life, service, or reward than another; but it is also believed that any man can aspire to any height, no matter how grea t. Thus, the level dignifies labor and the man who performs it. The level also symbolizes the passage of time. THE PLUMB The plumb is a symbol of uprightness of conduc t. In Freemasonry, it is associated with the plumb line which the Lord promised Amos he w ould set in the midst of His people, Israel, symbolizing God’s standard of Divine righteousne ss. When the plumb line is thought of in this way, it becomes a symbol of an upright life a nd of the conscience by which each person must live. This idea is closely tied to the concept of justice. THE PILLARS ON THE PORCH Two pillars were placed at the entrance to King Solomon’s Temple, which are symbolically represented within every Masonic lodge. Th ese pillars are symbols of strength and establishment—and by implication, power and cont rol. One must remember that power and control are placed before you, so you might realize th at power without control is anarchy, or that control without power is futility. Man must have both if his life is to be successful. The construction of dual pillars, obelisks, sphinx es, and so on was not uncommon in the ancient Near East. It is not known what their exact symbolism was. Speculation ranges from their signifying duality (that duality a nd polarity are twin forces th roughout Creation), guardianship of the temple, or symbolic gateways, to the idea of being a connection between heaven and earth. Some researchers have thought that the two pill ars before Solomon’s Temple represented the Pillar of Water and the P illar of Fire which led the Israelites through the de sert to the Promised Land. It was their guide in the light as well as in the dark. These pillars were designed and cast by Hiram, a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali (I Kings 7:13–14). The globes on the column s are said to be the celestial and terrestr ial spheres representing heaven and earth. The two pillars also correspond to the Three Great Supports of Mas onry. The columns of wisdom and strength are emblematically represented by the pillars in the south a nd north, respectively, and the candidate, as he is brought into the lodge, come s to represent the third column of beauty, or balance. THE WINDING STAIRCASE The Winding Staircase is a symbol of ascension. It is described as consisting of three, five, and seven steps. The number of steps has changed ove r the years in different Masonic systems and rites. Sometimes there were only five and sometimes there were seven. Preston listed 36, dividing them into one, three, five, seven, nine , and eleven. The Hemming lectures listed the number at 25. American Masonry has generally st ayed with 15. While much of the symbolism of the Winding Staircase is explained in the ritual it self, there are some inte resting points worthy of discussion."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 THREE THEOLOGICAL VIRTUES It should be clear that the number three is hi ghly significant in Freemasonry. There are three degrees, Three Great Lights, three columns, thr ee Grand Masters, three Principal Tenets of Freemasonry, and three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity. These virtues were considered a ladder to heaven, a nother symbol of ascent. The Four Cardinal Virtues presented in the first degree complement these in the sense that the four are symbolically horizontal (basically dealing with our actions here on earth), while the three are symbo lically vertical (referring to ascent to further Light). Masonic aprons are co mposite examples of the three and the four making seven. FIVE ORDERS OF ARCHITECTURE The Five Orders of Architecture are Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. The Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian were the original orders of archit ecture designed by the Greeks. It may be worth studying which order of architecture was likely to be used for certain temples. For example, the Parthenon on the Acropolis dedicated to Athena is Doric, as is her temple at Delphi. The Ephesian temple of Diana, a moon goddess, is Ionic. The geometrical symbol of five is the pentagram. The emblem of Pythagoras’ fraternity was the five-pointed star. At each point of the star was a Greek letter which all together spelled a Greek word meaning “health” ( ugitha ). In Masonic rites practiced in continental Europe, the Fellow Craft takes a journey through five points of a pentagram instead of up a Winding Staircase. SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES The Seven Liberal Arts and Scien ces are grammar, rhetoric, logi c, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Geometry is likely of greatest significance to Freemasons because it is the basis upon which the superstructure of Masonic symbolism is erected. The Seven Liberal Arts and Scie nces were formulated as early as C.E. 330. The Christian scholars adopted them soon afterwards and they fl owered at the Neo-Platon ic School at Chartres in 12th-century France. The study of these princi ples was considered a means to the knowledge of God and was expressed in the construction of the Cathedral of Chartres and many others in medieval period Europe. The first sculpted re presentations of the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences adorned the western door of the Cathedral of Chartres. The masters of Chartres taught that the prope r study of the Seven Li beral Arts guided the intellect to approach the hidde n Light behind the world. The invi sible underlying structure of reality and the truth could be apprehended in th is way. In the mid-13th cen tury it was also only after the humble Mason had mastered the Seven Liberal Arts that he became entitled to the designation of architect."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 ADMISSION TO TH E MIDDLE CHAMBER In ancient Graeco-Roman Mystery Schools, the initiate was guided by the Psychopompos , or “conductor of the soul.” The Psychopompos would usually meet the candidate at the entrance to the temple or cave where the rites would be pe rformed and guide him through as needed. This title originated in mythology with an epithet for Hermes, as conductor of deceased souls to Hades. One of our oldest manuscripts, the Cooke Manuscript ( circa 1450), referred to Hermes as the principal patron of the Craft. In Freemasonry, the role of the Psychopompos is fulfilled by the Senior Deacon. In the Fellow Craft degree, the Senior Deacon leads the candidate up the Winding Staircase, showing him firsthand the path by which the lo wer passions are transcended. Once the candidate has symbolically mastered his intellectual facu lties, represented by the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, he arrives at the Middle Chamber of th e temple, finally prepared to move from the outer to the inner, from the circumference to his own inner spiritual center, his heart. The passage from the Outer Porch to the Middle Chamber represents the development of one’s intellectual faculties th rough the Seven Liberal Arts and Scie nces in the material world as a means of advancing toward the spiritual worl d. Once the intellectual faculties have been sufficiently mastered, it is then necessary to move beyond them into the Middle Chamber. THE WAGES OF A FELLOW CRAFT Corn, wine, and oil are symbolic wages earned by the Fellow Craft Maso n who arrives at the Middle Chamber. These symbolize mental and spir itual wealth. Corn represents nourishment and the sustenance of life. It is also a symbol of plenty, and refers to the opportunity for doing good, working for the community, and performing servi ce to mankind. The corn referred to in this degree is actually what we call wheat. Wine is sy mbolic of refreshment, health, spirituality, and peace. Oil represents joy, gladness, and happiness . Taken together, corn, wine, and oil represent the rewards of living a good lif e. The actual “wages” are the intangible but no less real compensation for a faithful and intelligent use of the working tools, fidelity to your Obligations, and unflagging interest in and study of the structure, purpose, and possibilities of the fraternity. Such wages may be defined in terms of a deeper understanding of brotherhood, a clearer conception of ethical living, a br oader toleration, and a more re solute will to think justly, independently, and honestly. Corn, or grain, has also represente d the concept of resurrection. Wine has symbolized mystical a ttainments, Divine intoxication, and ecstasy. Oil is one of the elements of consecration, as perfumed oil was, and in many traditions still is, used to anoint. THE MASONIC LETTER “G” In the Fellow Craft degree the candidate is informed that the letter “G” is the initial of geometry as well as the initial of the name of the Supreme Being. From the time of the Old Charges and manuscripts up to the present, the synonymous natu re of geometry and Masonry is clearly stated. It is also obvious that “G ” is the initial of the word God in the English language."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 There are other considerations that the Masonic student might want to take into account. The immediate question for some may be, Why is ge ometry given such exalted status? One might also observe that the word “God” is not a name per se, but is a categor y of being—like “human being.” The name of the Supreme Being depe nds on what tradition a person follows, and it would not be incorrect to say that the true name of the Supreme Being cannot be known. Obviously, then, the letter “G” does not refer to the common usage of that term. These two issues have given rise to much speculati on regarding the focus given to th is one letter of the alphabet. We will offer a few of these speculations for your benefit. The ancient languages of Phoenician, Hebrew, and Greek all placed the “G” in th e third place. In Hebrew, the order is aleph , beth , gimel . In Greek, the order is alpha , beta , gamma , and so on. In both Hebrew and Greek, each letter is assigned a numerical value as well as a phonetic one, so that “G ” is equivalent to the number “3” in both lang uages. The Greek letter gamma looks like an upside-down “L.” It is two perpendicular lines forming the angle of a square. Gamma was also associated with Dionysus and resurrection. The importance of geometry to a full understand ing of Freemasonry becomes apparent to the candidate as he progresses through the degrees. He is unequivocally informed that geometry is the basis, or foundation, of Masonr y. It is thought that the Egyptia ns became skilled at surveying because the annual flooding of th e Nile obliterated boundary markers in their fields. They had to set out and calculate new boundaries each year. Th e Greeks named this skill geometry, or “earth measurement.” The Greeks, it is thought, made the advancement of us ing deductive logic to expand the knowledge into a th eoretical science, and Pythag oras is credited with this achievement. As these developments set the gr oundwork for much of the approach of the sciences, some consider geometry to be the first science. Pythagoras and his Order, and la ter, Plato and his Academy, raised geometry to a sacred science of discovering the nature of reality and through it the Deity. We have such statements from Plato as: “Geometry rightly treated is the knowledge of the eternal.” And also: “G eometry must ever tend to draw the soul towards the truth.” Later, Euclid systemically presented all the knowledge of geometry in his work Elements of Geometry , beginning with five unproved principles about lines, angles, and figures, which he called postulates. Euclid uses only the compass and straight edge for all the drawings, proofs, and solutions. There are some Masonic researchers who think th at the letter “G” represents a little-known system of philosophical letter- number interpretation known as Gematria . One of the earliest known references to this method is found about C.E. 200 in the Bariatha of R. Eliezer ben R. Jose, the Galilean, which is a colle ction of 32 rabbinical rules. Gematria is listed within this treatise as a rabbinical method of Biblical exeg esis. As already mentioned, the Hebrew and Greek alphabets were also used as numbers. Therefore, every Hebrew word and every Greek word is the sum of the value of the individual le tters. Exploring this technique of letter-number substitution, one looks for words, names, and phra ses that add up to like va lues. Like values are thought to have meaningful relationships. Fo r example, the Hebrew word for “heaven” ( ha- shamayim ) has the same numerical value as the word for “soul” ( neshamah ), that is, 395, derived by adding up each letter to arrive at a total. Th e Kabbalist would say this reflects an important relationship between the soul and heaven."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Another example of Gematria can be found by comparing the Hebrew words for “love” ( ahebah ) and “unity” ( echad ), both of which add up to 13. Combini ng the values of these two words gives us 26, the number of the Hebrew word rendered in English as Jehovah or Yahweh, the principal name of God. This is a clear in timation that the nature of G od can be understood as love and unity. This exegetical technique can be used with both the Hebrew Sc riptures and the Greek Christian Scriptures. There are other texts as well that have been found to contain hidden Gematria in Latin and Arabic. The practice of Ge matria has given rise to interesting techniques which purport to reveal a t ype of spiritual geometry hidden within the Scriptures. NUMBER, ORDER, SYMMETR Y, AND PROPORTION The great teachings of the Fellow Craft degree revolve around the importance of the Masonic study of number, order, symmetry, and proporti on. The Masonic use of the term geometry includes all of these. Th e ancient philosophers considered geomet ry to have the power to lead the mind from the world of appearances to the cont emplation of the Divine Order. It was also believed that the Seven Liberal Arts had the power to liberate the mind from material attachment. Further study for the Masonic student would most certainly include a detailed study of Pythagorean number philosophy, the Golden Me an, Plato’s work, the Neo-Platonists, and Kabbalistic Gematria. Duties and Rights of a Fellow Craft In addition to the rights you acquired as an Ente red Apprentice Mason, you have the right to sit in a lodge when opened in the Fellow Craft de gree, when accompanied by a Master Mason who has sat in lodge with you. You may visit another lodge opened in the Fellow Craft degree. You have the right to be instructed and examine d. If found proficient, you may request advancement to the next degree. The responsibilities are found in part in the Ob ligation, and you should review these along with the Obligation of the Entered Apprentice. Fina lly, you are reminded that you are to acquire the special knowledge introduced in this degree and seek to apply that knowledge to your duties in life so you can occupy your place in society with satisfaction and honor.
