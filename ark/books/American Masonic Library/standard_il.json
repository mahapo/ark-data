SW: My brother, Masonic tradition informs us that at the building of King Solomon’s Temple there were three principal classes of workmen, each of which as a distinctive badge wore their aprons in a particular manner. Entered Apprentices, being bearers of burdens, wore theirs with the bib turned up to prevent soiling their clothing, and although spots upon the apron of the operative workman brought credit rather than disgrace, yet you, as a speculative Mason, are taught to keep yours unspotted from the world. WM: My brother, it now becomes my duty, in accordance with an ancient custom adopted in every regular and well governed lodge,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"30 Grand Lodge Ritual to request you to deposit something of a metallic kind, not for its intrinsic worth, but that it may be laid up among the records in the archives of the lodge as a memorial that you were here made a Mason. I therefore make this request of you— something of a metallic kind. My brother, you are poor indeed. This request has not been made to trifle with your feelings. As we well knew, if you were duly and truly prepared, you had nothing of a metallic kind about you; but it is to make a deep and lasting impression on your mind, and should you ever meet a friend, more especially a brother Mason, in a like destitute situation, you should contribute as liberally to his relief as your ability will permit without material injury to yourself. As you are now clothed as an Entered Apprentice, you are entitled to your working tools. The working tools of an Entered Apprentice are the twenty-four inch gauge and the common gavel. The twenty-four inch gauge is an instrument made use of by operative masons to measure and lay out their work. But we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and a First Degree — Second Section 31 distressed worthy brother, eight for our usual vocations, and eight for refreshment and sleep. The common gavel isan instrument made use of by opera five masons to break off the rough and superfluous parts of stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use, but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spiritual building~ that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. WM: My brother, you now stand in the northeast corner of the lodge as the youngest Entered Apprentice, and it is with pleasure I can say that you there stand as a just and upright Mason, and I give it you strictly in charge ever to walk and act as such. You will now be reconducted to the place whence you came, invested with what you have been divested of, and returned to the lodge for further instruction. FIRST DEGREE — SECOND SECTION Explanatory Lecture My brother, you have now passed through the forms and ceremonies of your initiation, many of which to you may have appeared of a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"32 Grand Lodge Ritual 33 First Degree - Second Section light and trifling character such as might have been waived or adopted at pleasure. But I will, however, inform you that they are such as have been adopted and practiced in all lodges from time immemorial for rea- sons which I will now proceed to explain. You were divested of all metals when prepared to be made a Mason for two reasons. First, that you might carry nothing offensive or defensive into the lodge. Second, at the building of King Solomon’s Temple there was not heard the sound of axe, hammer, or any tool of iron. The stones were all hewn, squared and numbered in the quarries where they were raised; the timbers felled and prepared in the forests of Lebanon, conveyed by sea in floats to Joppa thence by land to Jerusalem, where they were set up by wooden mauls prepared for that purpose. The building when completed, its several parts fitting with such exactness, had more the appearance of the handiwork of the Supreme Architect of the Universe than of human hands. You were neither naked nor clad because Masonry regards no man for his worldly wealth or honors. This, therefore, was to signify that it is the internal and not the external qualifications of a man that should recommend him to be made a Mason. You were neither barefoot nor shod. This was in conformity to an ancient Israelitish custom. We read in the book of Ruth of the manner in former times concerning redeeming and concerning changing. Then, to confirm all things, a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor, and this was a testimony in Israel. This, therefore, was done to signify the sincerity of your intentions in the business upon which you were then about to enter. You were hoodwinked and with a cable tow once around your neck for three reasons. First, as you were then in darkness yourself, so should you keep all the world as regards the secrets of Freemasonry, until they shall obtain them as lawfully as you were then about to do. Second, that ~ our heart might be taught to conceive efore your eyes beheld the beauties of Freemasonry. Third, had you refused to submit to the forms and ceremonies of your initiation, being found unworthy to be taken by the hand as a brother, you might, by the help of the cable tow, have been led out of the lodge without discovering even the form thereof. You were caused to give three distinct knocks to alarm the lodge and inform the Worshipful Master that you were prepared for your initiation, and these allude to a text in Scripture: ‘Ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you.’ You might have applied this to your then situa - tion in Masonry in this manner: You asked the recommendation of a friend to be made a Mason. Through his recommendation you"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"34 Grand Lodge Ritual First Degree - Second Section 35 sought initiation. You knocked at the door of the lodge and it was opened unto you. You were received on the point of a sharp instrument pressing your naked left breast to signify that as that was an instrument of torture to your flesh, so should the recollection of it be to your conscience should you ever presume to reveal any of the secrets of Freemasonry unlawfully. You were conducted to the center of the lodge, caused to kneel and attend prayer, because no man should ever enter upon any great or import ant undertaking without first invoking the blessing of Deity. You were asked in whom you put your trust because, according to our Masonic institution, no atheist can be made a Mason. It was therefore necessary that you should profess your belief in Deity; otherwise no oath or obligation would have been considered binding upon you. You were taken by the right hand, ordered to arise, follow your conductor and fear no danger, to signify that, at a time when you could neither foresee nor avoid danger, you were in the hands of a true and trusty friend in whose fidelity you might with safety confide. You were conducted once around the lodge that all the brethren might see that you were duly and truly prepared. obstructions on your passage around the lodge because there were guards placed at the south, west and east gates of the outer court of King Solomon’s Temple to see that none passed or repassed but such as were duly qualified and had permission. It was therefore necessary that you should meet with these severa~l obstructions that you might be duly examined before you could be made a Mason. You were caused to kneel on your naked left knee because the left has ever been considered the weaker part of man. This, therefore, was to signify that it was the weaker part of Masonry upon which you were about to enter, it being that of an Entered Apprentice. You were caused to lay your right hand on the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses because t he right hand has in all ages been deemed the seat of fidelity. The ancients at times worshipped a deity under the name of Fides, which we sometimes see represented by two right hands joined; at others by two human figures holding each other by the right hand. The right hand, therefore, was made use of on this occasion to testify in the strongest manner possible the sinceUty of your intentions in the business in which you were then engaged. You were presented with a lambskin or white leather apron because the lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence. He, therefore, who wears the lambskin or white leather apron as the badge of a Mason You were caused to meet with several"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"36 Grand Lodge Ritual First Degree - Second Section 37 is thereby continually reminded of that purity of life and conduct which is so essentially necessary to his gaining admis - sion into the celestial lodge where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. You were requested to deposit something of a metallic kind to remind you of your then extremely poor and penniless condition, and should you ever meet a friend, more especi - ally a brother Mason, in a like destitute situation, you should contribute as liber - ally to his relief as your ability will permit without material injury to yourself. You were placed in the northeast corner of the lodge as the youngest Entered Apprentice because inoperative Masonry the first stone of a building is usually laid in the northeast corner. You were therefore there placed to receive your first instruction whereon to build your future moral and Masonic edifice. Forms and Supports WM: I will now proceed to explain to you what constitutes a lodge, its form, supports, covering, furniture, ornaments, lights, jewels, how situated, and to whom dedicated. A lodge consists of a certain number of Free and Accepted Masons, duly assembled, with the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, and a charter or warrant empowering them to work. Our ancient brethren met on a high hill or in a low vale, the better to guard against the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers ascending or descending. The form of a lodge is an oblong rectangle extending from east to west between north and south, from the earth to the heavens and from the surface to the center. It is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Masonry and that a Mason’s charity should be equally extensive. Masonry may be said to be metaphorically supported by three great pillars, called wisdom, strength and beauty; because it is necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. They are represented by the three principal officers of the lodge, the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. The Worshipful Master represents the pillar of wisdom, it being supposed that he has wisdom to open and govern his lodge, set the craft to work and give them proper instruction. The Senior Warden represents the pillar of strength, it being his duty to assist the Worshipful Master in opening and closing his lodge, pay the craft their wages if any be due so that none may go away dissatisfied, harmony being the strength and support of all institutions, especially ours. The Junior Warden represents the pillar of beauty, it being his duty to observe the sun at meridian"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"38 Grand Lodge Ritual First Degree - Second Section 39 height, the beauty and glory of the day. The covering of a lodge is the clouded canopy or starry-decked Heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by the aid of a ladder, called Jacob’s ladder, having three principal rounds, denominated faith, hope, and charity; teaching faith in God, hope in immortality, and charity to all mankind. But the greatest of these is charity; for faith may be lost in sight— hope ends in fruition—but charity extends beyond the grave, to the boundless realms of eternity. The furniture of a lodge is the Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses. The Bible we dedi - cate to the service of God, the Square to the Master, and the Compasses to the craft. The Bible we dedicate to the service of God, because it is His inestimable gift to man, and on it we obligate a newly admitted brother; the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office, and by it he is constantly reminded of the duty he owes to the lodge over which he has been called to preside; and the Compasses to the craft, who, by due attention to their use, are taught to circumscribe their desires, and keep their passions within due bounds with all mankind, but more especially with our brethren in Freemasonry. The ornaments of a lodge are the mosaic pavement, the indented tessel, and the blazing star. The mosaic pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the indented tessel of that beautiful tessellated border, or skirting, which surrounded it—with the blazing star in the center. The mosaic pavement is emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the indented tessel which surrounds it, of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us in this life and which we hope to enjoy by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the blazing star in the center. A lodge has three lights, situated east, west and south. There is none in the north because of the situation of Kin g Solomon’s Temple, which was placed so far north of the ecliptic that neither sun nor moon, at meridian height, could dart any rays into the northern part thereof. The north, therefore, we Masonically term a place of darkness. A Lodge has six jewels; three immovable and three movable. The immovable jewels are the square, level and plumb. The square teaches morality, the level equality, and the plumb, rectitude of life; and are worn by the three principal officers of the lodge, the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. The movable jewels are the rough ashlar, perfect ashlar and trestle board."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"40 Grand Lodge Ritual First Degree - Second Section 41 The rough ashlar is a stone taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The ~erfectashlar is a stone made ready by the the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of the fellowcraft. The trestle—board is for the Master to draw designs upon. By the rough ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the perfect ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the trestle-board we are also reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his trestle-board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of nature and revelation, which are our spiritual, moral, and Masonic trestle-board. Lodges are situated due east and west because King Solomon’s Temple was so situated. King Solomon’s Temple was so situated because Moses, after safely conducting the children of Israel through the Red Sea when pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts had erected by Divine command, a tabernacle, dedicated to God, which was placed due east and west to perpetuate the remembrance of that mighty east wind by which their miraculous deliverance was wrought, and to receive the rays of the rising sun. This tabernacle was an exact model for King Solomon’s Temple, of which every lodge is a representation. So, all lodges are, or ought to be, situated due east and west. Lodges in ancient times were dedicated to King Solomon, he being our first Most Excellent Grand Master; in modern times to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist—two eminent Christian patrons of Freemasonry; and since their time there has been represented, in every regular and well furnished lodge, a certain point within a circle, embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist. On the top of the circle rests the book of Holy Scriptures; the point represents an individual brother, the circle the boundary line of his duty. In going round this circle we necessarily touch on the two parallel lines, as well as on the book of Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err. Tenets and Cardinal Virtues WM: The tenets of a Mason’s profession are brotherly love, relief, and truth. By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family—the high and low, rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"42 Grand Lo&e Ritual First Degree — Second Section 43 Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. I C 4 To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men; but particularly on Masons, who profess to be linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affec - tion. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. My Brother: you will hereafter make yourself known among Masons by certain signs, a token, a word, and the points of ~ our entrance. The signs, token, and word ave already been exp~lained to you. The points of your entrance are four: namely, the gutteral, pectoral, manual, and pedal, and allude to the four cardinal virtues, temperance, fortitude, prudence, and just ice. Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the a71 Lurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or the contracting of any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence in which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequently subject him to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons, if not to the penalty of your obligation, which alludes to the gutteral. Fortitude is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril, or danger, when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice, and like the former, should be deeply impressed upon the mind of ever y Mason, as a safeguard or security against any illegal attack that may be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from him any of those valuable secrets with which he has been so solemnly entrusted, and which was emblematically represented upon your first admission into the lodge when you were received on the point of a sharp instrument pressing your naked left breast, which alludes to the pectoral."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"44 Grand Lodge Ritual First Degree — Second Section 45 Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge, and prudentially determine, on all things relative to our present •as well as to our future happiness. This vir - tue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be particularly attended to, in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token or word, whereby the secrets of Masonry may be unlawfully ob - ta ined, ever remembering the solemn obliga - tion you took while kneeling on your naked left knee, your right forming a square, your left hand supporting the HolyBible, Square, and Compasses, your right resting thereon, which alludes to the manual. Justice is that standard or boundary of right, which enables us to render unto every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with Divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and, as justice in a great measure constitutes the real good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate from the minutest principle thereof, ever remembering the solemn charge you received while standing in the northeast corner of the lodge, your feet forming the angle of a square, which alludes to the pedal. My brother: it is hoped and expected that you will apply yourself to the study of masonry as Entered Apprentices served their Masters in ancient times, which was with Freedom, Fervency, and Zeal, emblem - atically represented by chalk, charcoal, and clay, because there is nothing more free than chalk, the least touch of which leaves a trace behind; nothing more fervent than charcoal to which when well ignited, the most obdurate metals yield; nothing more zealous than clay or mother earth which is constantly being employed for man’s use and is as constantly reminding him that as from it he came so to it he must sooner or later return. Charge WM: My Brother: Having passed through the ceremonies of your initiation, I congratulate you on your admission into our ancient and honorable Fraternity. Ancient, as having existed from time immemorial; honorable, as tending to make all men so who are strictly obedient to its precepts. It is an institution having for its foundation the practice of the moral and social virtues. And to so high an eminence has its credit been advanced, that, in every age and country, men pre-eminent for their moral and intellectual attainments have encouraged and promoted its interests. Nor has it been thought derogatory to their dignity that monarchs have, for a season, exchanged the scepter for the trowel to patronize our mysteries and join in our assemblies."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"46 Grand Lodge Ritual First Degree — Closing 47 As a Mason, you are to regard the volume of the Sacred Law as the great light in your profession: to consider it as the unerring standard of truth and justice, and to regulate your actions by the Divine precepts it contains. In it you will learn the important duties you owe to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, by never mentioning His name but with that awe and reverence which are due from the creature to his Creator; by imploring His aid on all your Lawful undertakings, and by looking up to Him in every emergency, for comfort and support. To your neighbor, by acting with him upon the square; by rendering him every kind office which justice or mercy may require; by relieving his distresses, and soothing his afflictions; and by doing to him, as in similar cases you would that he should do unto you. And to yourself, by such a prudent and well—regulated course of discipline as may best conduce to the reservation of your faculties in their 11 uest energy; thereby enabling you to exert the talents wherewith God has blessed you, as well to His glory as to the welfare of your fellow-creatures. As a citizen, you are enjoined to be exemplary in the discharge of your civil duties, by never proposing or countenancing any act which may have a tendency to subvert the peace and good order of society; by paying due obedience to the laws under whose protection you live, and by never losing sight of the allegiance due to your country. As an individual, you are charged to practice the domestic and public virtues. Let temperance chasten, fortitude support, prudence direct you, and justice be the guide of all your actions. Be especially careful to maintain, in their fullest splendor, those true Masonic ornaments— brotherly love, relief, and truth. Finally: Be faithful to the trust committed to your care, and manifest your fidelity by a strict observance of the principles of the Fraternity; and by refraining to recommend any one to a participation in our privileges unless you have strong reasons to believe that by a similar fidelity, he will ultimately reflect honor on our ancient Institution. You will now be seated at the right hand of the Junior Warden in the South. CLOSING ON THE FIRST DEGREE (Closing begins here if the lodge has not been opened on a higher degree.)

SECOND DEGREE - SECOND SECTION Senior Deacon’s Lecture SD: My brother: Masonry is considered under two denominations, operative and speculative. Second Degree - Second Section 83 By operative masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of arch i— tecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and from which will result a due proportion and just cor - respondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings, and convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man, for the best, most salutary, and beneficent purposes. By speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion, as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of the creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfection of his Divine Creator. Our ancient brethren wrought in operative and speculative both. We work in speculative only. They wrought six days before receiving their wages; they did not work on the seventh because in six days God created the heaven and the earth, and rested on the seventh day; the seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"84 Grand Lodge Ritual Second Degree - Second Section 85 as a day of rest from the ir labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of the creation, and to adore their great Creator. The first object to which I wiLl call your attention on your passage to the Middle Chamber is a representation of two brazen pillars, one on your left hand, the other on your right. The one on the left hand is called Boaz and denotes strength; the one on the right is called Jachin and denotes establishment. Taken together they allude to a prom i~e of God to David that he would establish his kingdom in strength. They were cast on the plains of Jordan in the claygrounds between Succoth and Zeredathah, where all the brazen vessels of King Solomon’s Temple were cast by one Hiram Amon or Abi, a widowts son of the tribe of Naphtali. They were cast hollow to serve as a repository for the archives of Masonry and to guard agai~t accident by inundation and conflagration. They were each thirty—five cubits in height, twelve in circumference and about four in diameter. They were adorned by chapiters of five cubits each, making in all forty cubits high. These chapiters were ornamented with lily- work network and pomegranates which dende Peace, Unity and Plenty. i’he lily from its purity and the retired situation in which it grows denotes Peace; the network from the intimate connection of its parts denotes Unity, and the pomegranate from the exuberance of its seed denotes Plenty. These pillars were further adorned by pommels on their tops, representing globes, denoting the universality of Masonry. Let us pass on. The next object to which I will call your attention is a representation of a flight of winding stairs, consisting of three, five and seven steps. The number three alludes to the three degrees which every Master Masons lodge confers. Also, to the three principal officers of the Lodge, the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. The number five alludes to the five orders in architecture. By order in architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. ~en the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemencies of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Grand Lodge Ritual simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The orders are classed thus: the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. The ancient and original orders of architecture, revered by Masons, are but three—the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two—the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric; and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. The Number Five further alludes to The Five Human Senses, which are hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling, and tasting. The first three, hearing, seeing and feeling, are most revered by Masons because by the sense of hearing we hear the word, by that of seeing we see the sign, and by that of feeling we perceive the grip whereby one Mason may know another in the dark as well as the light. r Second Degree - Second Section The Number Seven liberal arts and grammar, rhetoric, geometry, music, and 87 alludes to the seven sciences which are logic, arithmetic, astronomy. Masonry, however, is more particularly founded on geometry, or the fifth science. Geometry is that science which treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered—from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, from a superficies to a solid. A point is a position without dimensions. A line is a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superficies is a figure dimensions, length and breadth. of two A solid is a figure of three dimensions, length, breadth and thickness. By this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his de - signs; the general, to arrange his sold - iers; the engineer, to mark out grounds for encampments; the geographer, to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of em - pires, kingdoms and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. In 86"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"88 Grand Lodge Ritual 89 Second Degree - Second Section Give me the pass. SD: Plenty. SD: By a sheaf of corn water ford. suspended near a JW: Whence originated this word as a pass? SD: In consequence of a quarrel between Jephtha, Judge of Israel, and the Ephraimites. The Ephraimites had long been a turbulent and rebellious people whom Jephtha had sought to subdue by wise and lenient measures but without effect. They being highly incensed and fraught with ven - geance at not being called upon to fight and share in the rich spoils of the Ammon— itish war, gathered together a mighty army and crossed the river Jordan to give Jephtha battle; but he being apprised of their intentions, assembled the men of Gilead, gave them battle and put them to flight. And to make his victory more com - plete, he placed guards at the several passes on the banks of the river Jordan and commanded them, if any should attempt to p ass that way to demand of them, ‘say now Shibboleth.’ But they, being of a differ - ent tribe could not frame to pronounce it aright and said “Sibboleth,” which trifling difference proved them enemies and cost them their lives. And there fell at that time, of the Ephraimites, forty and two thousand; since which time this word has been adopted as a pass whereby to gain admission into every regular and well- governed lodge of Fellowcrafts.

The wages of a Fellowcraft are corn, wine and oil, emblematical of the corn of nourishment, the wine of refreshment, and the oil of joy, denoting plenty, health, and peace. The jewels of a Fell owcraft are the attentive ear, the instructive tongue and the faithful breast. My Brother, I will now call your attention to the letter G which you see above the Master’s chair. It is the initial of Geometry. Geometry is the basis on which the superstructure of Masonry is erected. through her various wLndings to her most concealed recesses. By it we discover the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their respective orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us—all framed by the same Divine Artist—which roll through the vast expanse and are conducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the Divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to so - cieties and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by time and experience, have produced works which have been the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monu ments of antiquity on which the utmost exertions of human genius had been employed. Even the temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived.

(#) Charge WM: My brother: Being advanced to the second degree of Freemasonry, I congratulate you on your preferment. Masonry is a progressive moral science, divided into different degrees; and as its principles and mystic ceremonies ar~ regularly developed and illustrated, it is intended and hoped that they will make a deep and lasting impression upon the mind. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Fellowcraft, you are bound to discharge. Your general good reputation affords sat isfac tory assurance that you will not suffer any consideration to induce you to act in any manner unworthy of the respectable character you now bear; but, on the contrary, that you will ever display the discretion, the virtue, and the dignity which become a worthy and exemplary Mason. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offenses of your brethren; but in the decision of every trespass aga inst our rules you are to judge with candor, admo’n ish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The impressive ceremonies of this degree are calculated to inculcate upon the mind of the novitiate the importance of the study of the liberal arts and sciences, especially of the noble science or geo - metry, which forms the basis of Freemasonry, and which, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; for while it proves the wonderful properties of nature, it demon - strates the more important truths of morality. To the study of geometry, there - fore, your attention is specially directed. Your past regular deportment and upright conduct have merited the honor we have"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"96 Grand Lodge Ritual Second Degree - Closing 97 conferred. In your p resent character, it is expected that at all our assemblies you will observe the solemnities of our ceremonies, that you will preserve the ancient usages and customs of the Fraternity sacred and inviolate, and thus, by your example, induce others to hold them in due veneration. Such is the nature of your engagements as a Fellowcraft, and to a due observance of them you are bound by the strongest ties of fidelity and honor. You will now be seated at the right hand of the Senior Warden in the West.

It teaches us that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them without inconvenience to The sword pointing to a naked heart demon-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"160 Grand Lodge Ritual Third Degree — Third Section 161 strates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that all-seeing eye whom the sun, moon and stars obey, and under whose watchful care even comets perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. The anchor and ark are emblems of a well- grounded hope and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that Divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. The forty-seventh problem of Euclid was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of priesthood, and is said to have been raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, more especially in geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most distinguished he erected this, when, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed, Eureka! signifying, in the Grecian language, I have found it; and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. The Hour-glass is an emblem of human life. Behold, how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot, without astonishment, behold the little particles which are contained in this machine, how they pass away almost imperceptibly, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man! Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost, which nips the shoot, and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. The Scythe is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread oC life, and launches us into eternity. Behold, what havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race; if, perchance, we escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and, with health and vigor, arrive at the years of manhood, yet withal we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of time and be gathered to the land where our fathers have gone before us. Lastly, my Brother, I will call your attention to the setting—maul, the spade, and the coffin. The setting-maul, by which our Grand Master Hiram Abif was slain, is emblematical of that casualty or disease by which our own existence must sooner or later terminate. The spade which dug his must ere long dig"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Thus, my Brother, we close our lecture on the solemn thoughts of death: we are born, we breath, we suffer, we mourn, and we die. Yes, my brother, we are all born to die. We follow our rriends to the brink of the grave and, standing on the shore of a vast ocean, gaze with exquisite anxiety until the last dreadful struggle is over, and see them sink into the faThomless abyss. We feel our own feet slide from the precarious bank on which we stand, and but a few suns more, my Brother, and we too will be whelmed mid death’s awful waves, there rest in the stilly shade where the worm shall cover us and nought but silence and darkness reign around our melancholy abode. r Third De~ree — Third Section 163 Bible, that Great Light in Masonry, lifts the shroud, draws aside the sable curtains of the tomb, and bids hope and joy rouse up to sustain and cheer the departing spirit. It points beyond the dark valley of the shadow of death and bids us turn an eye of faith and confidence to the vast and opening scenes of boundless eternity.

These are striking emblems of mortality and afford serious reflection for the thinking mind. But the acacia or evergreen which bloomed at the head of his grave and betrayed the p lace of interment is emblematical of the immortal part which survives the grave and bears the nearest affinity to that supreme intelligence which pervades and animates all nature, and which can never, no never, die. But is this the end of man and the expiring hope of faithful Masons?
