[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THE YORK RITE OF FREEMASONRY FOREWORD We know the pleasure and gratification experi - enced on having been raised to the sublime de - gree of Master Mason. You have every right to lift up your head with pride in the knowledge thai you are now numbered among the thou - sands off good n~en throughou~z the world who stand for continual prorrrntion of Brntberly Love, Religious Freedom, and a Democracy which will bring peace and happi¶ness to men of all creeds and Nations. Do not ]et your Masonic education stop here! The True Mason is continually seeking for more Light and Knowledge, and when he asks for this Light and Knowiedge he is often told by well-meaning but mistaken Brothers that “as a Master Mason he has received all there is in Masonry” and thus, while not being really satis. fled, he believes and the quest for light ends. The purpose of this infoi-mative folder is to give a concise and connected view of the light as it is developed in the several degrees and ord&s of the York Rite, and it ~s hoped that these words of counsel and advice will make it clear to you that there are excellent reasons why you should complete your necessary Masonic education.

To promote a better understanding of the York Rite of Freemasonry, it is essential that we dismiss from our minds the idea of division or separation between the three Bodies that compose the York Rite. Such a separation is merely formal and for convenience. The York Rite is a Whole—not an aggregate of three Bodies. You cannot stop on the way—either with Blue Lodge, Chapter or Council, and claim to be a finished Mason. The work as progressively taken sheds light upon the prior degrees and orders, and no Mason can feel that he has everything to which he is entitled as an earnest seeker after truth until he has received all of them. You should not be misled by the Brother who tells you confidentially, but mistakenly, that “the Blue Lodge is all there is.” These degrees and orders are full of the most important and beautiful moral lessons ever im - parted to man. They are entitled, each and all of them, to be respected and loved for them - selves alone, and not as stepping stones to some - thing else. The following brief account of the York Rite is founded upon traditional and ethical ele - ments and does not undertake a historical or critical analysis. THE SYMBOLIC DEGREES (Conferred in Lodges under the Jurisdiction of a Grand Lodge) The Entered Apprentice is a bearer of burdens, the Fellowcx aft a ski]led workman and the Master Mason a director of the work. The Entered Apprentice Degree, the First de. gree in Freemasonry, admonishes the candidate to obey the rules and regulations and learn to practice secrecy. The background of this degree, like many others, is the building of King Solo - mon’s Temple in Jerusalem. The Entered Ap - prentice is taught symbolically to labor upon the building of the Temple, to subdue his passions, and to improve himself in Masonry. He receives here the beginning of the instructions which are to guide him in the search of the secret of Free - masonry. The Fe]lowcraft is instructed in the principles of Geometry. The different Orders of Architec - ture are explained to him and he is enjoined to study the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, and to proceed on his journey toward the attainment of Masonic knowledge. The Master Mason is taught numerous very important moral lessons governing his conduct in the world towards others; that he must an - swer and obey the rules of the oxder; must not cheat, wrong or defraud a brother or a Lodge of Masons, but on the contrary must help, aid and assist a distressed brother, his widow and or - phans. Preparation for the life to come is in - culcated by beautiful ceremonies. The Temple 2 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE is not yet completed, and those faithful crafts - men who have labored so long upon it are de - prived, by the wickedness of others of that for which they have wrought. The candidate re - ceives light as fully as it may come to him in the Symbolic Lodge, and the substitute for that which by further search he may hope to receive later, the real secret of a Master Mason. The building of the Temple symbolizes the perfection of our moral life and the continuous effort to erect within ourselves a spiritual building, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. CAPITULAR DEGREES (Conferred in R. A. Chapter) M~n~ MASTER This is the first of the four degrees in the Chapter, and in it, the candidate is still symboli - cally laboring on an unfinished temple as in the preceding degrees of the Blue Lodge. He is taught the nobility of labor and that in the erec - tion of his moral and spiritual temple he must determine and prepare the materials of which that temple is to be constructed and to have due care that in so doing the work which he shall present, bearing his mark, shall be such as to designate him as one worthy of admission to “that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” This degree is perhaps as old as, if not older than any other Degree of Ancient Craft Masonry. It is so ancient, in fact, that its real origin cannot be traced exactly; but in 1598, in Scotland, Statutes were issued which required the Operative Mason to register his “Mark.” No degree in Freemasonry can hardly be more in - teresting, more inspiring, or more instructive, than that of the Mark Degree. PAST MASTER In former times no one was eligible for the Royal Arch except Actual or Past Masters of Lodges, which meant that very few could re - ceive it, so the degree of Past Master was insti - tuted whereby one might become a “Virtual Master” by means of the ceremony of the de - gree, and thus be eligible for exaltation to the Royal Arch. 5 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MOST ExcEu..~-r MASi-ER This Degree recites the events surrounding the completion of King Solomon’s Temple and its dedication with imposing ceremonies to the serv - ices of the Most High God; the very idea upon which Masonic Symbolism has been based. King Solomon offers a sublime invocation, and fire comes down from heaven and consumes the burnt offerings and the sacrifices. The Brethren rejoice that their long labor is ended, lay aside their aprons, are greeted as Most Excellent Masters, and receive their reward. This ends the cycle of degrees having to do with the erection of King Solomon’s Temple and brings us up to the sublime story, spanning centuries of time, set forth in the Royal Arch Degree. RoYAL ARCH Its ceremonies for the most part are founded upon the return of the Israelites from captivity, their permission to rebuild the City of Jerusa - lem and the House of the Lord, and the dis - covery of many important relics and documents which had lain concealed for many years. This Degree is known as the summit of Ancient Craft Masonry. It was considered so important in our early history that none but actual Masters of Lodges were permitted to re - ceive it. This degree brings to light that for which the Master Mason has searched. Wherev - er there is a loss there should be a recovery, and the Royal Arch Degree vividly portrays that re - covery. Thus are connected together in the most intimate way the work of the Blue Lodge and the work of the Chapter, neither being complete without the other. THE CRYPTIC DEGREES (Conferred in Council of 11. & S. M.) It is a peculiarity of the York Rite, whether intended or not by the authors, that the move - ment of the degrees is often inverse, and the historical connection reversed so that we appar - ently go forward in regular progression, the knowledge and light gained always reflects back- ward upon the path we have travelled before, ~ and degrees that seemed complete when we re - ceived them are found to require the explanation of the subsequent degrees before they can be understood. That is what makes the infinite in - teiest in the work, and causes the reflective Ma - son to continually study the sublime precepts and ceremonies of the order. This is especially true of the Cryptic degrees, two of which his - torically preceded the Royal Arch but which hold in reserve their valuable teachings until the candidate is ready to receive them with the most impressive effect. RoyAl.. MAsTER In this degree Hiram Abif is alive and speaks, imparting to the candidate the sublime teach - ings of useful labor on earth and a worthy end of life. The tragedy of his untimely death is a gain brought forth with the great loss suffered by the Craft. This is one of the most beautiful degrees in all Masonry, with lessons so impres - sive that they are never forgotten. It is espec - ially illustrative of the third and seventh degrees. SELECr MASTER In this degree we have dramatized one of the incidents that occurred during the building of the Temple. It is closely connected with the Royal Arch Degree, and in fact it affords the explanation needed for its perfect understanding. 6 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The place of meeting represents a “Secret Vault” or crypt beneath the Temple. Our three ancient Grand Masters appear in charge of a very im - portant work connected ~vith the Temple. One of King Solomon’s most particular friends is pro - moted to the work, in which only a limited num - ber are employed. The historical object of the degree is to commemorate the deposits of an im - portant secret or treasure. Certain secrets are imparted to the candidate which make clear to him the preceding degrees. It is highly dramatic and of the greatest interest. SUPER-EXCELLENT MASTER This degree has no connection either in history or symbolism with the Royal and Select Master degrees. It refers to circumstances that occurred during the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuzaradan, commander of the army of the King of Babylon, and the ceremonies are intended to represent the final destruction of the Temple and the carrying away of the captive Jews to Babylon as exempli - fied in the Royal Arch Degree. The Super Ex - cellent Master Degree is divided into three strik - ing scenes. The first scene represents the Jewish captives at Babylon under the direction of Hag - gai, the Prophet. In the second scene King Zede - kiab, of Judab listens to his false counselors and despises the warnings of the Prophet Jeremiah, and the vengeance of the Lord is poured upon him. Jerusalem is captured and its wicked King is taken with his sons before King Nebuchadnez - zar, who causes the sons to be put to death be - fore their father’s face, after which he deprives the wretched parent of his eyesight and carries him in chains to Babylon. In colorful and spectacular manner, this de - gree portrays the fatal effects which follow the violation of sacred obligations. THE CHIVALRIC ORDERS (Conferred in Commandery of Knights Tern plar) O1inE1~ OF TEE Rim Cnoss The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross con - tinues the story of the Royal Arch and deals with the period in Jewish history, in the reigu of King Darius, when the Jews were returning to Jerusalem and the efforts to rebuild the Tem - ple. A grand council was convened at Jerusalem to deliberate upon the unhappy condition of the country and devise means to secure the favor of the King and his consent to their proceeding with the rebuilding of the city and Temple. Zerrubbabel participated in this council (represented by the candidate) and offered his services to travel to the Persian court and re - mind the King of his former promise to aid the Jews in the work. When Zerrubbabel’s turn came he proclaimed The Almighty Force of Truth. The King was so pleased that he told Zerrub - babel to ask what he would and it should be granted. Zeri-ubbabel then reminds him of his vow to rebuild Jerusalem and restore the holy vessels which were taken from the sack of King Solomon’s Temple, and to rebuild the house of the Lord. The King then makes a decree ac - cordmgly, and to perpetuate it he forms a new order founded upon TRUTH, the Order of the Red Cross, which is then conferred upon Zer - rubbabel. This Order prepares the way for the transition from the scenes of Ancient Craft Ma - sonry to Chivalric Masonry founded upon the Christian religion and the practice of Christian virtues. 8 9"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Here we bid farewell to all the degrees having to do with the budding of King Solomon’s Tem - ple, its destruction and the rebuilding of the city and temple, and we go forward to the period of the Crusades when the Order of Knighthood was formed to recover the Holy Sepulchre and to protect the pilgrims who visit its sacred shrines. TmiE MEDiTERRANEAN PASS AND Tint ORDER OF MALTA This order is the first Christian order encoun - tered by the candidate. The members represent soldiers of the Cross and the Order is dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The candidate humbly solicits to be admitted to the privilege of the Mediterranean Pass to enable him to safely un - dertake a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, and also to be enrolled as a Knight of Malta. In a beautiful and impressive ceremony, this order enjoins a strict adherence to the cause of Jesus Christ and the performance of those virtues em - phasized in His teachings. ORDER OF THE TEMPLE We now approach one of the grandest and most impressive orders in all Freemasonry; which completes the York Rite. The Order of the Temple, takes its name and receives much of its inspiration from a chivalric and military or - ganization of the 9th Century when the world was in a state of chaos, not knowing what was coming next. The candidate represents a Knight of the period that succeeded the Crusades, who has made a vow to visit the Holy Sepulchre, and is an aspirant to become a Knight Templar the better to fulfill that vow. As a trial of his worthi - ness there is enjoined upon him seven years of preparation, beginning with an unarmed pil - grimage in the direction of the Holy Shrine. Af - ter having served six years of this preparation he is commanded to devote the remaining year of preparation to penance as a trial of faith and humility. Beautiful lessons of the death and ascension of our Saviour are inculcated and the candidate is at last received into full fellowship in the most solemn manner. The scene in con - nection with the final obligation is probably the most impressive (and the one most likely to be remembered) in all of Freemasonry. Templars of the present day are men who by their loyalty and devotion are making Templary the splendid Christian Order which has the re - spect and admiration of the public at large, and good fellowship and loyal friendships have made the Order stand for something of supreme value in life. Those who have labored for Templary find in it something friendly, comforting and satisfying. It is not entirely ritualistic; rather it is laid in the hearts of men who are working for the good of the Order. It is a high responsibility to be the successors in this modern world of an Order so ancient, so noble and so glorious. 10 11"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"AFTERWORD Brethren! Know Your Masonry! We trust this information may be of great assistance to you in deciding to advance in Masonic knowledge. Master Masons are urged to give consideration to the advantages which will be theirs in be - longing to the remaining bodies of York Rite Masonry. They are eligible to petition for mem - bership in them after being raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. The journey you began as an Entered Ap - prentice Mason was actuated by lofty motives and you were impressed with the truths and principles which the first three degrees incul - cate, yet the half was not told you. The revela - tion of the lost word, the manner of receiving wages, and what were the wages, are still a mystery to you. Therefore, why be content with only a limited education when with but slight effort you may acquire a full and complete knowledge of these and many other important truths that will inspire and imbue you with that fervency and zeal that distinguishes the great leaders of our Craft. ORDER OF MAsoNIC DEGREES IN THE Yoiuc RrrE The following is the order in which the York Bite Degrees and Orders would be portrayed if presented in their chronological order: 1. The Portion of the Royal Arch antedat - ing the building of the Temple (Chap - ter). 2. The Entered Apprentice (Lodge). 3. The Fellow Craft (Lodge). 4. The Mark Master (Chapter). 5. The Royal Master. First Section (Coun - cil). 6. The Select Master (Council). 7. The Master Mason (Lodge). 8. The Royal Master. Second Section (Council). 9. The Past Master (Chapter). 10. The Most Excellent Master (Chapter). 11. The Super-Excellent Master (Council) and one section of the Royal Arch (Chapter). 12. The Concluding Section of the Royal Arch (Chapter). 13. The Red Cross (Commandery). 14. The Order of Malta (Commandery). 15. The Order of the Temple (Command - ery). From this arrangement it can be readily seen that any Mason who does not take all the degrees and orders in the York Rite cannot possibly have~ a thorough knowledge of even the Symbolic Lodge, let alone the Chapter, Council and Commandery. as published in General Grand Council Manual 12"}]
