Masonry teaches the practice of charity and benevolence, to protect chastity, to respect the ties of blood and friendship, to adopt the prin - ciples, and reverence the sacraments, of religion, assist the feeble, guide the blind, raise up the downtrodden, shelter the orphan, guard the altar, support the government, encourage wisdom, in - culcate morality, promote learning, love man, fear God, implore His mercy, and hope for hap - piness and immortality. 2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"( OPENING AND CLOSING THE LODGE.

The Holy Bible is given us as the rule and guide for our faith and practice; the Square, to square our actions; and the Compasses to circumscribe our desires, and keep our passions in due bounds with all mankind, especially the brethren. The three Lesser Lights are the Sun, Mooa, and Master of the Lodge, and are thus exp [ained: As the Sun rules the day and the Moon governs the night, so should the Worshipful Master, with equal regularity, rule and govern the Lodge. The representatives of t[Ie three Lesser Lights are three burning candles, or tapers, placed upon candlesticks, or pedestals, situated East, West, and South. * * * * I particularly direct your attention to the Great Light in Masonry, the Holy Bible.

Freemasonry, therefore, opens this Book upon its altars, with the command to each of its votaries that he diligently study therein to learn the way to everlasting life. Adopting no particu - lar creed, forbidding sectarian discussion within its Lodge rooms, encouraging each to be steadfast in the faith of his acceptance, Freemasonry takes all good men by the hand, and, leading them to its altars, points to the open Bible thereon, and urges upon eac[~ that he faithfully direct his steps through life by the Light he there shall find and as he there shall find it. If, from our sacred altars, the atheist, the infidel, the irreligious man, or the libertine, should ever be able to wrest this book of Sacred Laws, and thus remove, or even obscure, the greatest Light in Masonry, that light wiiic[~ for centuries has been the rule and guide of Free - masons, then could we no longer claim for our - selves the great rank and title of Free and Ac - cepted Masons; but, as long as that sacred light shines upon our altars, as long as it illuminates the pathway of the Craftsman by the golden rays of truth, so long, and no longer, can Fieemasonry live and shed its beneficent influeace upon man - kind. Guard and cherish that Book of sacred and immutable law. Live according to its Divine teachings, with their ever lasting assurance of a blessed immortality. I, APRON. M~ BROTHER, I now present you ~vith a lamb - skin or white leather apron.

Let its pure aud spotless surface be to you an ever - piesent reminder of a “purity of life and rectitude of conduct,” a never-ending argument for nobler deeds, for higher thoughts, for greater achievements. And when at last your weary feet shall have come to the end of their toilsome journey, and fiom your grasp shall fall forever the working tools of life, may the record of your life and actions be as white and spot]ess as the emblem which I place in your hand to-night.

It, being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is em - blematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby are found eight hours for the ser - vice of God and a distressed worthy brother, eight for our usual vocations, and eight for ref resh - ment and sleep. COMMON GAVEL. The Common Gavel is an instrument used by operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spiritual build ing~ that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

Supreme Architect of the Universe than that of human hands. * * * M~asonry regards no man on account of his worldly wealth or honors; it is the internal, and not the external, qualifications that reconunend a man to Masons. * * * * We read in the book of Ruth concerning their manner of changing and redeeming, that “To con - firm all things, a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor.” That was testimony in lsrael. This, therefore, we do, testifying thereby in the strongest manner possible the sincerity of our intentions in the work in which we are engaged. * * * “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” 1~ * * * Before entering upon any great or important undertaking we ought always to invoke the aid of DEITY. * * * THE LEFT SIDE. * * * * The right hand was deemed by our ancient brethren the seat of fidelity; the ancients wor - shipped a deity named FIDES, sometimes repre - sented by two right hands joined, at others, by two human figures holding each other by the right hand. The right, therefore,- we use in this great and important undertaking, testifying thereby in the strongest manner possible the fidelity of our pur - poses in the work in which we are engaged. * * * * The lamb, in all ages, has been deemed an em - blem of innocence. He therefore who wears the lambskin, or white apron, the badge of a Mason, is continually reminded of the purity of life and conduct necessary to his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. SECTION 3. This brings us to the third and last section of the degree, which explains the nature and prin - ciples of our constitution. Here, too, we receive instructions relative to the form, supports, cover - ing, furniture, ornaments, lights, and jewels, of a Io(lge; how it should be situated, and .to whom dedicated. A Lodge may be defined as a certain number of Free and Accepted Masons, duly assembled, fur - nished with the Holy Bible, Square, and Com - passes, together with a charter or dispensation from some Grand Body of competent jurisdiction empowering it to work. ~hL A"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"22 MONITOR OF THE WORK. THE CHARTER. The Holy Bible, ‘Square, and Compasses have been partially explained; the Charter has not. It pleased the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York, over which body M.~. W.~. ,Grand Master, at present presides, to grant to this Lodge the Charter now in its possession, empowering it to confer the three degrees in Masonry, which power we are now partly exercising. LODGES, WHERE HELD. Our ancient brethren held their Lodges on high hills or in low vales the better to observe the ap - proach of cowans and eavesdroppers, ascending or descending. Lodge niectings, at the present day, are usually held in upper chambers, probably for the better security which such places afford. The custom may have had its origin in a practice ob - served hy the ancient Jews when huilding their temples, schools, and synagogues, on high hills, a psactice which seems to have met the approhation of the Almighty, who said unto the Prophet Ezeldel, “Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof, round about shall he most holy.” FORM AND DIMENSIONS. The form of a Lodge is * * * * in length from east to west, in breadth from north to south, ENTERED APPRENTICE. 23 as high as Heaven and deep as from the surface to the center. It is thus extensive to denote the universality of Freemasonry, and teaches that a Mason’s char - ity should be equally extensive. SUPPORTS. A Lodge is supported by three great pillars, de - nominated lVisdom, Strength, and Beauty, for there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn, all great and im - p6rtaut undertakings. They are represented by the threc principal officers of the Lodge, the pillar Wisdom, by the Worshipful Master in the East, who is presumed to have wisdom to open and gov - ern the Lodge; the pillar Strength, by the Senior Warden in the West, whose duty it is to assist the Worshipful Master in the performance of his ar - duous labors; and the pillar Beauty, by the Junior Warden in the South, whose duty it is to call the Craft from labor to refreshment, superintend them during the hours thereof, e~refully to observe that J the means of refreshment are not perverted to in - temperance or excess, and see that they return to their labor in due season, that the Worshipful Mas - ter may receive honor, and they pleasure and profit thereby. COVERING. The covering of a Lodge is no less than the clouded canopy, or starry-decl~ed heaven, where -j ("},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"24 MONITOR OF THE WORK. 25 ENTERED APPRENTICE. all good Masons hQpe at last to arrive, by aid of that ladder which Jacob in his visiou saw extended from earth to He~.ven, the principal rounds of which are denominated FAITH, HOPE, and CHAR - ITY, which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is CHARITY. For our faith may be lost in sight, hope end in fruition, but charity lives beyond the grave, through the boundless ages of eternity. FURNITURE. Every regular and well governed Lodge is fur - nished with the Holy Bible, Square, and Com - passes, together with a Charter, or Dispensation. * * * * The Holy Bible is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man, * * * *; the Square to the Master, be - cause it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compasses to the craft, for, by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circum - scribe their desires, and keep their passions within due bounds. ORNAMENTS. The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pave - ment, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representatiou of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the In- ‘dented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border ) or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, check - ered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel, or tesselated border, of the manifold blessings and comforts which constantly surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm reliance on Divine Providence, represented by the blazing star in the center. LIGHTS. A Lodge has threei symbolic lights, situated East; West, and South. The North we Mason - ically term a place of darkness. JEWELS. A Lodge has six jexvols, three movable and three immovable. The Immovable Jewels are the Square, the Level, and the Plumb. They are so termed be - cause they are appropriated to particular parts of the Lodge where alone they should be found, the Square to the East, the Level to the West, and the Plumb to the South. The Square teaches morality; the Level, ‘equal - ity; and the Plumb, rectitude of conduct. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ash lar, and the Trestle-Board. The Rough Ashla’r is a stone in its rude and natural state, as taken from the quarry; the Per - fect Ashlar, one prepared by the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of Fellow Craft; —4"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK. ENTERED APPRENTICE. 27 and the Trestle-Board is for the Master Workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ash lar we are reminded of that rude and imperfect state which is ours by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of Deity. And as the operative workman erects his temporal building in accordance with the designs laid down upon the Trestle-Board by the Master Workman, so should wje, both operative and speculative, en - deavor to erect our spiritual building in accord - ance with the designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the great Book of revelation, which is our Masonic trestle-board. HOW SITUATED. A Lodge is situated due east and west, because King Solomon’s Temple was so situated. Moses, by Divine command, having conducted the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, through the Red Sea, into the wilderness, erected a Tabernacle to God, which he situated due east and west, to commemo - rate to the latest posterity that miraculous east wind which wrought their mighty deliverance. King Solomon’s Temple is said to have been a representation of that Tabernacle. TO WHOM DEDICATED. Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solo - mon, as he is sa~id to have been our first Most E~ - / cellent Grand Master; but speculative Masons dedicate theirs to the memory of St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist, and, siuce their time, there is represented, in every regular and well-governed lodge, a certain POINT WIThIN A CIRCLE, the point representing the in - dividual brother, the circle, the bound -_ _ ary line of his conduct to God and ~ ~ man, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, prejudices, or iutercsts to betray him on any occasion. This cir - cle is bordered by two perpendicular parallel lines representing these saints, and upon the vertex rest the Holy Scriptures, which point out the whole duty of man. In going around this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself thus circum - scribed, it is impossible that he should materially err. PRINCIPAL TENETS. The three principal Tenets of our profession are those truly commendable virtues, Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the human race as one family, the high, the low, the rich, the poor, who, being created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabiting the same planet, should aid, support, and protect one an - other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"28 MONITOR OF TIlE WORK. 29 ENTERED APPRENTICE. c~ery country, sect, and opinion, and promotes true friendship among those who might otberwise have remained perpetually at a distance. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly upon Masons, who are linked together by a chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with them in their misfortunes, to compassionate their miser - ies, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, are aims we have in view. On this basis, we form our friendships, and establish our connections. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught iu Masonry. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us; sincerity and plain deal - ing distinguish us; and the heart and the tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and re - joicing in each other’s prosperity. * * * * GUTTUR, .- — THE THROAT.

The world itself styles him who knows no God a heathen. He is a menace to society and a moral blank in himself.

It is so far interwoven with religion, as.to lay us under obligation to pay that homage’ to Deity which constitutes both our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view, with reverence and admiration, the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most ex - alted idea of the perfeetiou of his Divine Creator. The second section of this degree also refers to the origin of the Jewish Sabbath, as well as to the manner in which it was kept by our ancient brethren.

THREE STEPS. * * * * FIVE STEPS. * * * * ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE. By ORDER IN Artcn ETECTURE is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornaments of eolumns and pilasters; or, it is a regular ar - rangement of the projeeting parts of a building, whiiih, united with those of a eolamn, form a beautiful, perfeet, and eomplete whole. From the first formation of soeiety, order in arehitecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to eontrive shelter from the inelemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a eove ring. The bands whieb eonneeted those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and eapi - tal of pillars; and, from this simple hint, origi - nally proeeeded the more improved art of arehi - tecture. The five orders are thus elassed: the TUSCAN, DORIC, IONIC, CORINTHIAN, and COMPOSITE. k y"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"40 MONITOR OF THE WORK. ~THE TUSCAN is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and entablature have hut few mouldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would he superfluous. THE DORIC, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, except mouldings; though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the orna - ments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Done is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the naturahposition of solid bodies. THE IONIC bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and the more delicate orders. Its column is nine diam - eters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the invention of uhich is at - tributed to the Jonians. The famous temple of DIANA, at Ephesus, was of this order.

THE COMPOSITE is compounded of the other orders and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has quarter-rounds, as have the Tuscan and Done orders; it is ten diameters high, and its cornice has den - tils, or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. The aneient and original orders of architeeture, revered by Masons, are three, the Done, lome, and Corinthian, whieh were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two, the Tusean, whieh they made plainer than the Done, and the CompositQ whieh is more ornamental than the Corinthian. * * * * TI-IS FIVE HUMAN SENSES are Hearin a Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and 0, Tasting.

THE SEVEN STEPS. * * * THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES are Grammar, Rhetorie, Logie, Arithmetic, Geom - etry, Musie, and Astronomy. GRAMMAR. Grammar is the science which teaches us how to ex - press our ideas in appropriate words, which we after - ward adorn by means of Rhetoric; while Logic instructs us how to think and reason with propriety. Arithmetic, which is the science of computing by numbers, is essen - tial, not only to a thorough knowledge of mathematical science, but also to an intelligent pursuit of our daily vocations. If desired the following may be given: Grammar is the key by which alone the door can be opened to the understanding of speech. It is Grammar which reveals the admirable art of language, and un - Folds its various constituent parts, its names, definitions, and respective offices; it unravels, as it were, the thread of which the web of speech is composed. These reflec - tions seldom occur to anyoiie before his acquaintance with the alt; yet it is most certain that, ~vithout a knowledge of Grammar, it is very difficult to speak with propriety, precision, and purity. RHETORIC. It is by Rhetoric that elegance of diction is acquired. To be an eloquent speaker, in the proper sense of the I FELLOW-CRA FT. 43 word, is far from being either a common or an easy attainment; it is the art of being persuasive and com - manding; the art, not only of pleasing the fancy, but of speaking both to the understanding and to the heart. LOG [C is that science which directs us how to form clear and distinct ideas of things, and thereby prevents us from being misled by their similitude or resemblance. Of all the human sciences, that concerning man is certainly mast worthy of the human mind, and the proper manner of conducting its severa[ powers in the attainment of truth and knowledge. This science ought to be culti - vated as the foundation or groundwork of our inquiries; particularly in the pursuit of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons. V ARITHMETIC is the art of numbering, or that part of mathematics which considers the properties of numbers in general We have but a very imperfect idea of things ~vithout quantity, and as imperfect of quantity itself without the help of Arithmetic. All the works of the Almighty are made in number, weight, and measure; therefore, to unde~stand them rightly, we ought to understand arithmetical calculations; and the greater advancement we make in fte mathematical sciences, the more capable we shall he of considering such things as are the ordi - nary objects of our conceptions, and be thereby led to a mole comprehensive knowledge of our great Crea~or~ and the works of the creation.

A point is that which has position, but not magnitude, and is the beginning of all geometrieal matter. A line is length without breadth. An ang]e is the differenee in direetion of two 1 nterseeting lines. A surfaee s that which has only length and breadth. A solid is a magnilude which has length, breadth, and thiekness. By this seienee the arehiteet is enabled to eon - struet his plans and execute his designs; the gen - eral, to arrange his soldiers; the engineer, to mark out grounds for encampments; the geographer, to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein eontained, to delineate the extent of seas, and speefy the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinees.

MORAL ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY. Geometry is the basis of Freemasonry. By Ge - ometry we may curiously trace Nature through her various windings to her most eoneeated re - eesses. By Geometry we diseover the power, wis - dom, and goodness of the Great Arehiteet of the I: Universe, and view with awe the proportions of this vast system. By Geometry we diseover how the planets move in their respeetive orbits, demon - strate their various revoLutions, and aeeount for the return of the seasons and the variety of seenes which each season displays to the diseerning eye. About us are numberless worlds, whieti move through the vast expanse, all framed by the Divine FELLOW-CRAFT. 53 ereator, and all eonducted by the unerring laws of Nature. A snrvey of Nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first deter mined man to imitate the Divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The arehiteet began to design; and the plans whieh he laid down, improved by time and experienee, have resulted in wor]cs which are fhe admiration of every age. The Lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignor - anee and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of an- 4 tiquity, on which’ the utmost exertions of human genius had been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spaeious and magnifleent, and con - strueted by so many celebrated artists, eseaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Free - masonry, notwithstanding, survives. Tools and imp]enients of arehiteeture, and symbolie em - blems, most expressive, are seleeted by the Fra - ternity to impress upon the mind wise and serious truths; and thus, through a sueeession of ages, are II transmitted unimpaired the tenets of our institu - tion. I If every brother admitted within the sacred walls of this middLe ehamber will heed the les - sons here ineulcated, and remember that as a Freemason he is also a buiLder, not of a material edifice, but of a temple more glorious than that of Solomon, a temple of honor, of jus - ( Ii V"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK. tiee, of purity, of knowledge, and of truth, and that these emblems of the operative mason’s art indieate the labors he is to perform, the dangers he is to encounter, and the prepa - rations he is to make, in the uprearing of that spiritnal fabrie wherein his soul shall find rest forever, then, indeed, will the attentive ear have reeeived the sound from the instruetive tongue, and the mysteries of Freemasonry be safely Lodged in the repository of the faithful breast. Many long years ago upon the Eastern plains was this our institution set up based upon principles more durable than the metal wrought into the statues of ancient kings. Age after age rolled by, storm and tempest hurled their thundeis at its head, wave after wave of bright, insidious sands curled about its feet and heaped their sliding grains against its sides, men came and went in fleeting generations, seasons fled like hours through the whirling wheel of time, but through the tempest and the Atorm, through the attrition of the waves and sands of life, through good report and had, it has continued to spread its beneficent influence wider and wider over the earili. * * * * EAST.

His Holy name. The honor of performing this sacred service was denied to David, King of Israel, because he had made great wars and shed blood abundantly. From the same sacred source we learn that God had promised David that out of his loins He would raise up seed to serve him. This Divine promise was afterward fulfilled in the person of Solomon. After David had been gathered to his fathers, and the last honors paid to his memory, Solomon wielded the scepter of Israel, peace reigned within her borders, and the children of Israel looked forward for the display of that wisdom which was destined to astonish the world. In the second month of the fourth year of his reign, Solomon commenced the erec - tion of this edifice, the workmanship of which excited the wonder and admiration of succeeding ages. It was located on Mount Moriah, near the place where Abraham was about to otTer up his son Isaac, and where David met and appeased the destroying angel. The Temple was yet in its inception when Solomon addressed a letter to Hiram, King of Tyre, in which he portrayed the honors clustering around the throne of Israel, and inviting the Tyrian Monarch to share these hon - ors by furnishing men and material to aid in buil&ing a rpabernacle to the Most High.

As we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious, never content to be idle, while our fellow creatures are in want, if it is in our power to relieve them. When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless than the brute crea - tion. He lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenaiice for himself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering him - self from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent of all other beings, but as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, men were made dependent on one another for protection and security, whereby they enjoy better opportunities to form the ties of love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"68 MONITOR OF THE WORK. of GOD; and he that will so demean himself as not to endeavor to add to the common stock of knowl - edge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, unworthy of our protection as Masons. THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS guarded by the Tiler’s Sword reminds us that we should ever be watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words, and actions, particularly when in presence of the enemies of Masonry, ever re - membering those truly Masonic virtues, Silence and Circumspection. THE SWORD POINTING TO A NAKED HEART illustrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of men, yet that ALL-SEEING EYE, Whom the sun, moon, and stars obey, and under Whose watchful care even comets perform their stupendous revolutions, searches the inmost re - cesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. THE ANCHOR ~A~D THE ARK are emblems of a well-grounded hope, and a well- spent life. They are emblematical of the dtvine Ark, which bears us over this tempestuous sea of MASTER MASON. troubles, and the Anchor which shall safely moor us in the peaceful harbor where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM of Euclid teaches Masons to be lovers of the arts and sciences, and was the result of the labors of our ancient brother, PYTHAGORAS’. Among his most noteworthy achievements was this problem, that the square erected upon the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares upon the two other sides. THE HOUR GLASS is an emblem of human life. As swiftly run its sands, so rapidly our lives draw to a close. Be - hold the little particles how they puss away. In the short space of an hour they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man. “To-day, he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; to-morrow, blossoms, and bears his b]ushing honors thick upon him; the third day comes a frost, a killing frost, and, when he thinks, good, easy roan, full surely his great - ness s a-ripening, nips his root, and then he falls,” like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth.

BROTHER, your zeal for the institution of Ma - soRry, the progress you have made in the mystery, and your conformity to our regulations, have pointed you out as a proper object of our favor and esteem. You are now bound by duty, honor, and grati - tude to be faithful to your trust, to support the dignity of your character on every occasion, and to enforce, by precept and example, obedience to the tenets of the Fraternity. In the character of a Master Mason, you are authorized to correct the errors and irregularities of your uninformed brethren, and to guard them against a breach of fidelity. To preserve the repu - tation of the Fraternity unsullied must be your constani care, and for this purpose it is your prov - ince to recommend to your inferiors, obedience and submission; to your equals, courtesy and affa - bility; to your superiors, kindness and considera - tion. Universal benevolence you are always to inculcate, and, by the fegularity of your own be - havior, afford the best example for the conduct of others less informed. The ancient landmarks of the Fraternity, entrusted to your care, you are Ii carefully to preserve, and never suffer them to be infringed, or countenance a deviation from the established usages and customs of the Fraternity. Your virtue, honor, and reputation are con - cerned in supporting with dignity the character you now bear. Let no motive, therefore, make you swerve from your duty, violate your vows, or betray your trust, but be true and faithful, and imitate the example of that celebrated artist whom you this evening represent. Thus you will ren - der ~‘ourself deserving of the honor which we have conferred, and merit the confidence we repose in you. I, Q~. This: CHARGE. Mx BROTHER, each of our three degrees has its respective paramount duty. That of the Entered Apprentice is your duty to God; that of the Fellow- craft is your duty to your neighbor; and that of this, the Master Mason degree, is your duty to yourself. There is no strained reversal of order in this, nor does Masonry ditTer with nature or reve - lation in her sequence of teaching. God comes first always, for, in Him we live and move and have our being. Our neighbor comes second be - cause God Himself has so ordered in those ten greater Commandments written with His own finger of Diyinity. We ourselves, come last because without duty to God we should lack the strength 70 MASTER MASON."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"72 MONITOR OF THE WORK. 73 MASTER MASON. to perform, and without duty to our neighbor we should lack the Golden Rule, which alone shows us the demand of a duty to ourselves. Your man - hood does not depend upon your position, but upon your character in life. The establishment as well as the acknowledgment of true manhood is in your own hands. Too many think that reputation en - sures it; do not wait for that. Seek the true defi - nition of a man and then exemplify it. Do not have two characters, one for your fellows and an - other for privacy. Be a true man in your own home as well as out in life. Scorn to debase yourself because the door of publicity is locked. Let even your own solitude keep company with the gentleman within it. Speak the same lan - guage to men that you do to your mother. Look upon women as you would have other men look upon your sisters. Resent the unclean speech as a challenge against your claim to good breed - ing. Demand respectful treatment from your neighbor, but first command - your own self- respect. Let nothing be more intolerable in youl sight than the letting down of yourself to a lower level. Bid men conic up to you, but refuse to descend a single step to them. Do not measure your importance by your titles or your money, but by the texture of your character and the cleanliness of your speech. Make others to know always that a gentleman stands before them. The teaching of this degree, then, is that it is your duty to make the most and the best of yourself. It is your duty as a man among men; as a son, or husband, or father; as a citizen of th [5 great Republic; as a duly obligated Master Mason; as the most glorious climax of all created things; for the true man is the human image of the Mason’s God."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"75 INSTALLATION OF LODGE OFFICERS. INSTAlLATION OF LODGE OFFICERS. The installation of the officers of new lodges is done by the Grand Master or his proxy; in exist - ing lodges, it is the prerogative of the retiring Worshipful ill aster., but may be done by his proxy. The installing officer should be addressed by his title of IVorshipful and his assistant as Brother Marshal.

TO THE BRETHREN OF THE LODGE. -1 I Brethren of the Lodge, such is the nature of our Constitution, that some must of necessity rule and teach, others must submit and obey. The offi- cers yon have chosen, and who have been solemnly installed, are sufficiently acqnainted with the rules of propriety, and the laws of the institution, to avoid exceeding the powers with which they are entrusted. The harmony of the Lodge will mate - rially depend upon the good order you may pre - serve in the conduct of its business, and the cour - tesy and forbearance you may observe toward each other in its deliberations. I charge you, then, as yon shal] answer at the last day, that you act worthy of the vocation with I which you are called, and suffer no faults, no im - perfections on your part, to tarnish the lustre of your jewe[s, or bring discredit on the Craft. Rec - ommend Masonry to the world by the rectitude of your conduct. To this end make yourselves inti - mately acqnainted with all its principles and obli - gations, and practice in your lives all its dQties and requirements. Divest yourselves, brethren, of co]dness and apathy, so fatal to your best interests. Shnn those affections and groveling passions un - worthy of a soul that claims affinity with the “Sons of Light,” and put forth all your energies to grasp whatever is noble or elevating in thought, I A"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK. and whatever can reveal new and sublime ideas pertaining to our lofty destiny. Guard against dissensions among yourselves. Let no root of bit - terness spring up to trouble you. Use all yoar exertions to preserve your Lodge pure, and pre - vent the introduction of vice or error in its thou - sand forms. If, in the frailty of mortality, a brother falls under the influence of unholy feel - ings, and wanders into forbidden paths, seek the wanderer out, bring him back to the fold, and show him the superior lovelincss of virtue. Much may be acconipl~shed by the force of good example, and by offering good counsel in a frendly spirit evcr remembering that “To err is human, to forgive Divine.” Finally, brethren, be of one mind; tive in peace. Let nothing disturb that pure, warm, and holy love which our ritual enjoins. Follow these in - junctions, and your Lodge wilt flourish. May the tenets of your profession be transmitted through your Lodge unimpaired from generation to gen - eration. PROCLAMATION.

Upon the death of a sojourner who had expressed a wish to be buried with Masonic ceremonies, the duties prescribed in Article 3 will devolve upon the Master of the Lodge within whose jurisdiction the death may have occurred, unless there be ffiore than one Lodge in the place, and if so, the funeral services ivill be performed by the oldest Lodge, unless otherwise mutually arranged. & Whenever other societies, or the military, unite with Masons in the burial of a Mason, the body of the de - MASONIC FUNERAL SERVICE. 93 ceased must be in charge of the Lodge having jurisdic - tion, and the services should, in all respects, be conducted as if none but Alasons were present. 6. If the deceased was a Grand or Past Grand Officer, the Officers of the Grand Lodge should be invited, whon the Master of the Lodge having jurisdiction will invite the Grand Officer present who has attained the highest rank to conduct the burial service. 7. The pall-bearers should be Masons, and should be selected by the Master, with the approval of the family of the deceased. If the deceased was a member of a Chapter, or other Alasorfic body, a portion of the pall - bearers should be taken from these bodies severally. 8. The proper clothing to be worn at a Masonic funeral is black or dark clothes, high black hat, a black neck-tie, white gloves, a band of black crape around the left arm above the elbow, a sprig of evergreen on the left bicast, and the apron if so ordered by the Master. The Mas - ter’s gavel, the Wardens’ columns, the Deacons’ ~‘vnd Stewards’ rods, the Tiler’s sword, the Bible, the Book of Constitutions, and the Marshal’s baton, should be trimmed with black crape. 9. As soon as the remains are placed in the coffin, there should be placed upon it a plain white lambskin apron. 10. If a Past or Present Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, or Grand Warden, should join the procession of a private Lodge, they take place after the Master of the Lodge. Two deacons~ with white rods, should be ap - pointed by the Master to attend a Grand Warden; and when the Grand Master or Deputy Grand Master is present, the Book of Constitutions should be borne be - fore him, a Sword-Bearer should follow, and the Dea - cons, with white rods, on his right and left. 11.

Upon arriving at the entrance of the cemetery, the brethren should march in open order to the tomb or grave. If the body is to be placed in the former, the Tiler should take his place in front of the open door, and the lines be spread so as to form a circle. The coffin should be deposited within the circle, and the Stewards and Deacons should cross their rods over it. The bearers should take their places on either side, the mourners at the loot of the coffin, and the Master and other officers at the head. After the coffin has been placed in the tomb, the Stewards should cross their rods over the dooi, and the Deacons over the Master. If the body is to be de - posited in the earth, a squaie should be formed around the grave, the body being placed on rests over it; the Stewards should cross their rods over the foot, and the Deacons the head, and retain their places through- F out the services. 13. After the clergymen shall have performed the re - ligious services of the church, the Masonic services should begin. 14. When a number of Lodges join in a funeral pro - cession, the position of the youngest Lodge is at the head or right of the procession, and the oldest at the end or left, excepting that the Lodge of which deceased was a member shall have the place of honor. 5. The procession must return to the Lodge-room in F he same order that it marched to the grave. 16. A Lodge in procession is to be strictly under the discipline of the Lodge-room; therefore, no brother can enter the procession or leave it without express permis - sion from the Master, conveyed through the Marshal; nor shall Aprons be publicly worn except when in actual procession. 17. It is advisable that only the Committal Service be used at Masonic funerals. MASONIC FUNERAL SERVICE. 95 SERVICE WI{[CH MAY BE USED IN TEE LODGE-ROOM.

Again we are called to assemble among the habitations of the dead, to behold the “narrow house appointed for all living.” Here, around us, in that peace which the world cannot give or take away, sleep the unnumbered dead. The gentle breeze fans their verdant covering, they heed it not, the sunshine and the storm pass over F them, and they are not disturbed, stones and let - tered monuments symbolize the affection of sur - F viving friends, yet no sound proceeds from them, save that silent but thrilling admonition, “Seek ye the narrow path and the strait gate that lead unto eternal life.” We are again called upon to consider the un~ certainty of human life, the immutable certainty F of death, and the vanity of all human pursuits. MASONIC EU~ERAL SERVICE. Decrepitude and decay are written upon every liv - ing thing. The cradle and the coffin stand in jux - taposition to each other, old age and youth touch hands, and it is a melancholy truth, that so soon as we begin to live, that moment also we begin to die. It is passing strange that notwithstand - ing the daily mementoes of mortality that cross our path, notwithstanding the funeral bell so often tolls in our ears, and the “mournful procession” goes about our streets, that we wi]l not more seri - ously consider our approaching fate. We go on from design to design, add hope to hope, and lay out plans for the employment of many years, until we are suddenly alarmed at the approach of the Messenger of Death, at a moment when we least expect him, and which we properly conclude to be the meridian of our existence. What, then, are all the externals of human dig - nity, the power of wealth, the dreams of ambition, the pride of intellect, or the charms of beauty, when nature has paid her just debt? Fix your eyes on the last sad scene, and view life stripped of its ornaments, and exposed in its natural mean - ness, and you must be persuaded of the utter emptiness of these de] usions.

Perfection on earth has never yet been attained; the wisest, as well as the best of men, have gone astray. Suffer, then, the apologies of human nature to plead for him who can no longer plead for himself. Our present meeting and proceedings will have been vain and useless if they fail to excite our serious reflections, and strengthen our resolutions of amendment. Be then persuaded, my brcthren, by the uncertainty of human lIfe, and the unsub - stantial nature of all its pursuits, and no longer postpone the all-important concern of preparing for eternity. Let us each embrace the present moment, and whi]e time and opportunity offer, prepare for that great change, when the pleasures of the world shall be as a poison to our lips, and the happy reflection consequent upon a well-spent life affords the only consolation. Thus shall our hopes be not frustrated, nor we hurried unpre - pared into the presence of that all-wise and power - ful Judge, to whom the secrets of all hearts are known. Let us resolve to maintaIn with greater assiduity the dignified character of our profession. May our faith be evinced in a correct moral walk and deportment; may our hope be bright as the glorious mysteries that will be revealed hereafter; and our charity boundless as the wants of our ‘11 MASONIC FUNERAL SERVICE. fellow-creatures. And having faithfully discharged the great duties which we owe to GOD, to our neighbor, and ourselves, when at last it shall ~> p[ease the Grand Master of the universe to sum - mon us into his eternal presence, may the trestle- board of our whole lives pass such inspection that it may be given unto each of us to “eat of the hid - den manna;’ and to receive the “white stone with a new name,” that xvil[ insure perpetual and nn - speahble happiness at his right hand. The Master then presenting the apron, continues: The lambskin or white leather apron is an emblem of innocence, and the badge of a Mason. It is more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Ro - man eagle, more honorable than the Star and Garter, when worthily worn. The Master then deposits it in the grave: This emblem I now deposit in the grave of our deceased brother. By it we are reminded of the universal dominion of Death. The arm of Friend - ship cannot interpose to prevent his coming, thc wealth of the world cannot purchase our release, nor will the innocence of youth or the charms of beauty propitiate his purpose.

This, too, I deposit in the grave. Alas, my brother!” The brethren then move in procession round the place of interment, and severally drop the sprig of evergreen into the grave, exclaiming, Alas! my brother; after which the Masonic funeral honors are given: The honors are given by extending the hands toward the grave with the palms up; all the brethren repeating in unison: “To the grave we consign the mortal remains of our deceased brother.” The arms are crossed over the breast, the left above the right, the fingers touching the shoulders, all repeat - ing in unison: “We cherish his memory here.” The hands are then raised above the head, and looking upward, all repeating in unison: K; ___ / MASONIC EUNERAL SERVICE. 109 “His spirit we commend to God who gave it.” The hands are then dropped to the side.

Lord of all! below—above— Fill our hearts with truth and love; When dissolves our earthly tie, Take us to thy Lodge on high. The Master then continues the ceremony. Friends, from time immemorial, it has been the custom among the fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, upon request, to accompany the remains of a Brother to the place of interment, and there to deposit them with the usual formalities. In conformity to this usage, and at the request of our deceased brother, whose memory we revere, and whose loss we now deplore, we have assembled in the character of Masons, to offer before the world the last tribute of our affection, thereby demonstrating the sincerity of our past esteem for him, and our steady attachment to the prin - ciples of the Institution. The Great Creator having been pleased, out of his infinite mercy, to remove our brother from the cares and troubles of this transitory existence, to a state of endless duration, thus severing an - other link from the fraternal chain that binds us together, may we, who survive him, be more strongly cemented in the ties of union and friend - ship; that, during the short space allotted us here, we may wisely and usefully employ our time, and, in the reciprocal intercourse of kind and friendly acts, mutually promote the welfare and happiness of each other.

To those of his immediate relatives and friends, who are most heart-stricken at the loss we have all sustained, we have but little of this world’s consolation to offer.

Human life, the great hill of God’s handiwork, with its ledges and plateaus which mark the various heights of ascent, and upon whose sides his creatures come and go, rises out of the river of mystery which encircles it, and looks down upon, and then across, to the oppo - site shores of the land of si]dnce. Out of that land on the east side of the great hill the mystery of life begins. In fancy draws its first breath, opens its eyes, exists by instinct only, until reason dawns, beckons, and leads; then it begins to live, and to creep the hillside.

He sees others creep, others walk, some leap, and others climb, but reaching one or other of the various ledges, tumble back again into the river of mystery. It saddens him and makes him think. Then he turns himself from the scene, the river, and the ]and of silence, to ffnd that his road of life’s journey bends downward, and is surely leading him to the river and to the silent shores beyond.

After the Committal the Chaplain or Master shall say this prayer: Chap lain.—O Lord, support us all the day long of this troublous life until the shadows lengthen, and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over and our work is done. Then in thy mercy, Lord, grant us a safe lodging, a holy rest, and peace at the last. Amen. Brethren.—So mote it be.

Chaplain.—” The peace of God be upon and within us all! The everlasting Arms keep us close. The light of the Fathers welcome trans - figure us on the morn of the endless day. Amen.” Brethren.—So mote it be. A SHORTER FORM OF BURIAL SERVICE, WHICH MAY BE USED AT THE GRAVE DURING VERY INCLEMENT WEATHER. After the officers and brethren have taken their proper positions at the grave, the service begins by the follow - ing or some suitable PRAYER. Almighty and most merciful Father, we adore Thee as God of time and eternity. As it has pleased Thee to take from the light of our abode one dear to our hearts, we beseech Thee to bless and sanctify unto us this dispensation of Thy providence. Inspire our hearts with wisdom from on high, that we may glorify Thee in all our ways. And when our toils on earth shall have ended, may we be raised to the enjoyment of fadeless light and immorta[ life in that kingdom where faith and hope shall end. And Thine, 0 right - eous’ Father, shall be the glory forever. Amen. Response.—So mote it be. The following erhortation is then given: BRETHREN: We have assembled to-day as Masons to offer to the memory of our deceased MASONIC FUNERAL SERVICE. 119 brother this last tribute of our affection. Unto the grave we consigu his body—earth to earth; ashes to ashes; dust to dust—there to remain till the trump shall sound on the Resurrection morn. We can trustfully leave him in the hands of Him who doeth all things well, who is glorious in holi - ness, fearful in praises, doing wonders. The Master, then presenting the apron, continues: The lambskin apron is an emblem of innocence, and the badge of a Mason. The Master then deposits it in the grave. This emblem I now deposit in the grave of our deceased brother. We are here reminded of the universal dominion of Death. The Master, holding the evergreen, continues: This evergreen is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. By it we are re - minded that we have an immortal part within us which shall never, never die. The brethren then move in procession around the place of interment and drop the sprig of evergreen into the grave. The funeial honors are then given. The Master then continues the service in the follow - ing words: To those of the immediate relatives and friends who are most heart-stricken at the loss they have sustained, we have but little of this wor[d’s con- r"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"120 MONITOR OF THE WORK. solation to offer. We can oniy sincere[y, deeply, and most affectionately sympathize with them in their afflictive bereavement, and remind them that He who “tempers the wind to the shorn lamb” looks down with infinite compassion upon the be - reaved in the hour of their desolation, and ~vill fold the arms of his love and protection around those who put their trust in Him. Then shall follow one of the prayers at the end of the full service, which concludes the ceremonies at the grave. PREROGATIVES AND DUTIES OF THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER. By the prerogatives of the Worshipful Master are meant the inherent right and authority he pos - sesses by reason of the position he occupies, giving him, as it does, extraordinary powers and privi - leges, which belong to the presiding officer of no other association. In all cases his decision on points of order is tina] in thc Lodge, for it is a settled principle of Masonic law that no appeal can be taken to thc Lodge From the decision of the Master. The Grand Lodge a]onc, or the Grand Master, can overrule his decision on any point of order. The prerogatives of the W. M. are too numerous and varied to be all enumerated. Some of the principal ones are here presented, coupled with some of the more important of his duties, which are plainly in harmony with his prerogatives. FIRsT PRIiROGATIVII.—TO convene his Lodge, set it to work, and give it proper instruction for its labor. The W. M. is the judge of the emergency that may K require a special or called meeting, and without his con- sent, except at the times for stated or regular communi - ations, the Lodge cannot be convened, and any business transacted at a special communication without his san tion is illegal and void. r 4"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"— — - .Y’ .-.-----~-—,~- . - MONITOR OF THE WORE. FIRST IDUTY.—To attend regularly the com - munications of his Lodge. This duty is so plain as to hardly need a comment. Few things weaken and demoralize the Lodge so much as the Master’s frequent absence. SECOND PREROGATIVE.TO preside at all com - munications of his Lodge. This is a self-evident proposition, and follows as a natural consequence of his installation. There is this peculiarity attached to the Master of a Masonic Lodge; when once duly installed, he cannot resign nor can he be deprived of his right to preside, by any power residing in the Lodge itself. Re is bound, however, to pay hom - age to the Grand Master; hence, when the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or other duly appointed representative, appears in the Lodge, the right of the Master to preside t emporarily disappears, unless the superior authority waive the right. The W. M. may call upon an experienced Past [Viaster to preside, but he remains responsible to the Grand Lodge for the proceedings, as fully as though he held the gavel in person. He may resume the East at auy moment, in his discretion. In his absence, the S. W. opens, and presides over, the Lodge. In the absence of both the W. M and the S. W, these powers devolve upon the J. W. In the absence of all three, the Lodge cannot be opened, and in all eases the Lodge cannot legally be opened unless the charter is present. SRCOND DUTY.—To open his Lodge at the time specified in the By-laws, and close it at a suitable hour. There is nothing more discouraging than the tardiness of the W. M. in opening his Lodge. Carelessness and in- PREROGATIVES AND DUTIES. 123 difference on his part beget the same in the members. The Master is the sole judge of the time to close the Lodge, but communications should not be unduly pro - longed. Trniw PRIrROGATIVE.—TO fill temporarily all vacancies that may occur in the Lodge offices. As it is his duty to set the craft at work, it is necessary that he have the active cobperation of all the officers, and if any are absent he has full power to select from the brethren present such as he may deem competent to discharge the duties. There is no advance - ment by right. If the S. W. is absent, the 3. W? does not ex-offleje fill the West. The W. M. appoints a S. W. pro tern. Tn 11W IJTJTY.—TO preserve order in the Lodge. His very name, MAsTER, suggests the authority with which he is invested to keep order. The GAVEL, placed in his hand when he was installed, is an emblem ol power and control, and if properly wielded will insure 2 cheerful obedience and secure pei feet order and decorum. FOURTH PREROGATIvE AND Duvy.—To regu - late the admission of visitors. One of the duties of the W. M. is the preservation of harmony among the brethren by the exercise of vigi - lance against the admission of cowans, or of those brethren who would by their presence disturb the peace of the Lodge and binder its work. In the discharge ot this duty the W. M. should exercise his prerogative and refuse admission to any visitor whose presence would be objectionable to any member. It would he a poor in - centive to peace and harmony to admit one who would cause offense. r 122"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"124 MONITOR OF THE WORK. FIFTH PREROGATIVE.—TO control and termi - nate discussions. This right is not to be exercised in a haughty, arbi - trary, or dictatorial manner, but with determination to administer impartial justice, to the end that the peace and harmony of the Lodge may be preserved, and its prosperity secured. This prerogative is a landmark es - sential to the position of the W. M., the only method by which he can sustain himself in his responsibility to the Grand Lodge, and, happily for his position, one that will rarely bring him into conflict with his hi ethren, while the good sense of obedience, inculcated in every degree of Masonry, will bend the minds of the brethren to support the W. Mi. in a judicious exercise of power. It is his right to discuss all questions without leaving the chair. FIFTH IDTJTY.—To preserve peace and harmony in the Lodge, and by his deportment both in his Lodge and out of it, to set an example to his brethren. The W. M. should impress upon the members of his Lodge the dignity and high importance of Masonry, ad - monish them never to disgrace it, charge them to prac - tice out of the Lodge those duties ~vhich they have been taught ia it, and by amiable, discreet, and virtuous con - duct, convince mankind of the excellence ~of the institu - tion, so that, when any one is said to be a Freemason, the world may know that he is one to whom the brother - hood may pour forth its sorrows, to whom distress may prefer its suit, whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is e~panded by benevolence. SIXTH PREROGATIVE AND DUTY.—TO be the custodian of the charter of the Lodge, and trans - mit it to his successor. PR.EROGATIVIiS AND DUTIES. 125 At his installation the W. M. receives in charge the charter of his Lodge, which is by him transmitted to his successor in office. Under its authority alone can the Lodge be oiganized, and its presence is necessary to the legality of all meetings. It is his duty carefully to pie serve it, as its loss would cause serious inconvenience. SEVENTEI PREROGATIVE.—TO determine all questions of order, and what business shall bc brought before the Lodge. SEVENT El IDUTY.—To render the ritualistic work of the Lodge and instruct the brethren therein. The Master should be in fact master of the work, competent to render every part thereof. EIGHTH PREROGATIVE.—TO appoint all com - mittees. EIGHTI-I DuT~.—To cause to be made an in - vestigation into all unmasonic conduct on the part of members of his Lodge, of non-affiliatcs and members of other Lodges resident within his jurisdiction. NYNTH PREROGATIVE.—TO order the issuance of notifications to members. The distinction between “Notification~~ and a “Sum - nions” is so great that it is strange how many over - look it. The former issles from the W. M. or the Lodge, and is practically a strong Invitetioa. It is at the option of the brother receiving it to attend the meet- r"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"-‘I’ 126 MONITOR OF THE WORK. ing or not, as be pleases. But a “Summons” comes directly under the province of his os., and for its neglect he may be disciphuedand punished. To disobey a sum - mons is a serious Masonic offense. NINTH IDUTY.—To visit the sick. TENTH PREROGATIVE.—To give the casting vote in case of a tie. This is limited, however, to votes takcn viva voce, or by upraiscd hands. The W. M. may vote upon oidinaiy questions or not, as he chooses, but it is not usual for him to do so. Upon questions requiring the ballot he should always vote. In ordinary questions, if there is a tie, he should set - tle questions by his vote. TENTH IDTJTY.—To cxercise supervision ovcr thc minutes, that nothing improper be recorded, and nothing essential to a complete record be omitted. ELEVENTH PREROGATIVE.—TO sign all drafts upon the Treasurer for the payment of Lodge dis - bursements, by vote of the Lodge. Nor may the Treasurer lawfully pay out funds without such order. It is usual to give the W. M. authority to appropriate, in emergent cases of charity, small sums, without tak - ing the consent of the Lodge, but for all other dis - bursements the treasury of the Lodge can only be opened by Lodge order. TWELFTH PREROGAT]VE.—TO represent the Lodge in Grand Lodge. PREROGATIVES AND DUTIES. Tn IRT EENTH PEERoGATI vE.—To select the ap - pointive officers of the Lodge. FOURTEENTH PEEROGATIVE.—TO install his suc - cessor. This prerogative not being a duty, it is always com - petent for a retiring Master to seleet a well qualified brother to conduct the ceremonies of installation."}]
