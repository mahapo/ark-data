Let the benign gen - ius of the mystic art preside over our coun - sels; and, under her sway, let us act with a dignity becoming the high moral character of our venerable institution.

I 1. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that, unbiased by the improper solici - tation of friends and uninfluenced by mer - cenary motives, you freely and voluntarily offer yourself as a candidate for the mys - teries of Freemasonry? 2. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you are prompted to solicit the privileges of Freemasonry by a favorable opinion conceived of the institution, a desire for knowledge and a sincere wish to be serv - iceable to your fellow creatures? 3. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you will cheerfully comply with all the ancient usages and established cus - toms of the fraternity? D. Do you believe in the existence of one supreme and everlasting God, in some reve - lation of His will, and in the immortality of the soul? [First impressions are supremely important. The Master should thoroughly know this degree and do his best work in impressing the candidate witb the beauty and sacredness of Freemasonry on this, his first vision 13 of Light. No jesting or frivolous conversation should occur in the preparation. All that is said and done should impress the candidate with the seriousness of the step he is about to take. The following lecture should be given in the preparation room by the Senior Deacon.j LECTURE IN PREPARATION ROOM BeXore proceeding further it becomes my duty to inform you that the ceremonies in which you are about to engage are by no means of a light or trifling character, but are of great importance and deep solemnity. Freemasonry is a beautiful system of moral - ity, veiled in allegory and illusirated by sym - bols. The design of the Masonic Institution is to make its members wiser, better and con - sequently happier; and this is accomplished by means of a series of moral instructions taught, according to ancient usage, by types, symbols, allegorical figures and lectures. The forms and ceremonies of this Institution have come down through a succession of ages and are all designed to impress upon the mind wise and serious truths. [ will now leave you in the hands of true and trusted brethren, who will see that you proceed as all others have done who have gone this way before."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"wstichtingargusnl ‘wstichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargusnl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargusnl rw.stichti ngargus nl w.stichtingargus.nl wstichti ngargus.nl rwstichtingargusnl w.stichtingargusnl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargusnl ‘w.stichtingargusnl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargusnl ~wstichtingargus .nl ~w. stichtingargus .nl ‘w. stichtingargusnl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus nl ~w. stichtingargusnl ~w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargusail w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargusril w.stichtingargus.nl -w. stichtingargusnl wstichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus iii w. stichtingargus.nl to 5. 14 ENTLCI:o Ai’iiiEN’riel: FIRST SECTION t so shouLd the recollection be to your mind and conscience * * * Trusi in God A Mason before entering upon any great or important undertaking should invoke the aid of Almighty God.

Our ancient brethren held their Lodges on a high hill or a low vale, the better to ob - serve the approach of cowans and eavesdrop - pers and to guard against surprise. The Form of a Lodge The form of a Lodge is an oblong square; in length from east to west; in breadth, from north to south; in height, from the earth to the highest heavens; in depth, from the sur - face to the center. A Lodge is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Free - masonry, and to teach us that a Mason’s charity should be equally as extensive.

M., who is presumed to have wisdom to open and govern the Lodge, devise labor for the craft, and superintend them during the hours thereof. The column Strength, in the west part of the Lodge, is represented by Ihe S. W., because st is his ‘duty to assist the W. M. and strengthen and support his authority. The column Beauty, in the south part of the Lodge, is represented by the J. W., because from his position in the south he is first to observe the meridian sun, which is the beauty and glory of the day; to call the craft from labor to refreshment and superintend them during the hours thereof; to see that none convert the hours of refresh - ment into intemperance or eacess; to call them on again in due season that the W. M. may have honor, and they pleasure and profit thereby. The Covering of a Lodge The covering of a Lodge is no less than the -clouded canopy or starry-decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive by the aid of that theological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw ascending from earth to heaven, the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity, and which teach us Faith in God, Hope in immortality, and Charity to all man- ENTERED APi’iiENTiCE kind. The greatest of these is Charity; for our Faith may be lost in sight; Hope ends in fruition; but Charity extends beyond the- grave, through the bound]ess realms of eter - nity. The Furnilure of a Lodge The furniture oE a Lodge consists of the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God because it is the inestimable gift of God to man; the Square to. the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; the Compasses to the craft, because by due attention to Iheir use they are taught to circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds. The Ornaments of a Lodge The ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaje Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; and Ihe Indented Tessel of that beautiful tessellated border or skirt - ing which surrounded it. The Mosaic pave - ment is emblematical of human life check - ered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel, of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us and which we hope to ob - tain by a faithful re]iance on Divine Provi - dence which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I I III IIIE~II~I — — ——— 1w.stichtingargus.fl I 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtlngargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtngargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.StichtiflgarguS.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl ‘wstichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus .nl ‘w.stichtingargus .nl ‘w.stichtingar~us.n1 ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.ni ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.hl xv. stichtingargus.nl 5. 24 ENTERED APPRENTICE The Lights of the Lodge The Lights of the Lodge are three, situated east, west and south. There is no light in the north, because King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was placed so far north of the ecliptic that the sun and moon at their meridian height could dart no rays into the northern part of the building. The north, therefore, we Masoni - cally term a place of darkness. The Jewels of the Lodge The jewels of the Lodge are six, three im - movable and three movable. The J mmovable Jewels are the Square, Level and Plumb. The Square teaches morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of conduct. They are termed immovable because they belong at fixed stations in the Lodge—the Square in the east, the Level in the west, and the Plumb in the south, and are the jewels of the officers filling these stations. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ash]ar and the Ti estleboard; so termed because they are not confined to any particular part of the Lodge. The Rough Ashlar is a stone taken from the quarry in its rude, natural state. The Per Eect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen to be adjusted by the working 25 ENTERED APPRENTICE tools of the Felloweraft. The Trestleboard is for the Master Workman to draw his de - signs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestleboard we are also reminded that as the operative workman erects his temporal buildings agreeably to rules and designs laid down by the master on his trestleboard, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the great books of nature and revelation which are our moral and Masonic Trestleboard. The Situation of a Lodge The situation of a Lodge is due east and west, because when Moses crossed the Red Sea, being pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he erected by divine command a tabernacle in the wilderness which he placed due east and west to receive the first rays of the rising sun, and to commemorate that mighty east wind by which their miraculous deliverance was effected. This tabernacle is a pattern of King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1w.stichtingargus.n I 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtlngargus.nl 1w.stichtlngargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichti ngargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv.stichtingargus .nl ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.ni ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.hl xv. stichtingargus.nl 5. 2,3 ENTERED AIPRESTIcE Dedication of Lodges Our ancient brethren dedicated their Lodges to King Solomon because he was our first most excellent Grand Master, but Ma - sons of the present day dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Freema - sonry; and since their time, there is repre - sented in every regular and we]l-governed Lodge a certain point wilhin a circle em- bordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist; an~l upon the top rests the Holy Scriptures. The point represents the individual brother; the circle, the boun - dary line of his duty beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, interests or prejudices to betray him. In going around this circle we necessari]y touch on the two parallel lines, as well as the Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within these due bounds, it is impossible that he should materially err. 1 iliockwell.

An ancient Masonic tradition found in the anclenh York lectures is to the following effect: Lodges were dedicated to King Solomon from the building of the temple of the Babylonish captivity, thence to Zerub - babel until the coming of Christ; thence to Saint John tIm l3apthst until the tinal destruchion of the temple • by TItus In the ielgn of Vespasian Owing to the massscrcs and disoiders consequent on that event, hl’reeinasonry declined, many Lodges entirely suspend - ed and iew had sufficient numbers to make them le~al. A general meeting of Freemasons was then held in the city of Benjamin, whose conclusion was that the cause of the Masonic decline was the want of a Grand Master. AccordIngly, seven of the most eminent Masons, by authority of this general com - titunication, waited on Saint John the Evangelist, at that time Bishop of Ephesus, and requested him to accept ihie office of Grand Master. He answered that, although past ninety years of age and feeble, yet, having been initiated Into Masonry early in his life, he would accept the offIce. ‘He did so and there - by completed by his learning what the other SaInt .lohn had accomplished by his zeal, and thus drew what the old records term a line parallel. After his decease, the ChrIstian Lodges were dedicated to him and Saint John the Baptist, they both beIng regarded as emineni patrons of Freemasonry.

This virtue is equal]y distant from rashness and cowardice; and, like the former, should be deeply im - pressed upon the mind of every Mason as a safeguard or security against any illegal at - tack which may be made by force, or other - wise, to extort from him any of those valua - ble secrets with which he has been so sol - emnly entrusted and which were emblem - atically represented upon his first admission into the Lodge. * * * * * Prudence Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of rea - son, and 15 that habit by which we wisely dge and prudentially determine on all things ju relative to our preseni as well as our fu - ture happiness. This virtue should be the pe - culiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the world It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies, never I’ to let fall the least sign, token or word, ENTERED APPRENTICE 31 whereby the secrets of Masonry might be unlawfully obtained. * * * * * Justice • Justice is that standard or boundary of right which enables us to render to every man his just due without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human law, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and as justice in a great measure conslitutes the real good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every good Mason never to deviate from the minutest principles thereof. How Entered Apprentices Serve Entered Apprentices should serve their Masters wilh Freedom, Fervency and Zeal, which are represented by Chalk, Charcoal and Clay.

It furnishes us with dwellings, and with convenient shelter from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of sci - ence and industry is implanted in man for the j FELLOWCEAFT 80 best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. Speculajive Masonry By Speculative Masonry we learn to sub - due Ihe passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. II is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligation to pay that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happi - ness. It leads the contemplative Mason to view, with reverence and admiration, the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator. We work in Speculative Masonry, but our ancient brethern worked in both Operative and Speculative Masonry. They labored at the construction of King Solomon’s Temple and many other sacred and Masonic edifices. They worked six days in the week and rested upon the seventh day; for in six days God created the heaven and the earth and rested upon the seventh day; the seventh therefore our ancient brethern consecrated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying fre - quent opportunities to contemplate the glor - ious works of creation and to adore their great Creator.

The five orders are thus classed: The Tus - can, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. TUSCAN The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the five orders It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base and entablature have but few moldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. THE DORIC The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, except moldings, though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state. In aftertimes when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric; for when it was L constructed in its primitive and simple form~ the name Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to the pillar in its origina] state. THE IONIC The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high, its capital is adorned with volules, and its cornice has dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the famous temple of Diana at Ephesus was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeab]e young woman, of an elegant shape, dressed in her hair, as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man. THE CORINTHIAN The Corinthian is the richest of the five orders, and is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its cap - ital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentils and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb struc - tures.

Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he per - ceived a basket of toys covered with lile, placed over an acanthus root, having been left there by. her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encompassed the basket till, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction, and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with the object, set about imitating Ihe figure; the base of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus, the tile; and the volutes, the bending leaves. THE COMPOS[TE The Composite is compounded of the other orders and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Cor - inthian and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has quarter-rounds, as the Tuscan and Doric orders; is ten diameters high; its cornice has dentils, or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, e]egance, and beauty are displayed. The Invention o~ Order in Architecture The ancient and originial Order of Archi - tecture revered by Masons are no more Ihan three—the Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these FELLOWCRAFT 47 the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer Ihan the Doric; and the Composite, whtch was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and es - sentially differ from each other; the two oth - ers having nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally; the Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state: and the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, are we indebted for what is gi~eat, judicious and distinct in architecture. Of these eive orders, the Ionic, the Doric, and the Corinthian, as the most ancient, are most esteemed by Masons. The Ionic, from the skill and ingenuity displayed in its con - struction, is emblematic of the Column of Wisdom, which is situated in the east part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Wor - shipful Master, the Doric, from the massive strength of its structure, is emblematic of the Column of Strength, which is situated in the west part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Senior Warden; and the Corinthian, from the exuberance of its ornaments, is em - blematic of the Column of Beauty, which is s[tuated in the south part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Junior Warden."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus .nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.StichtiflgargUS.fll 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus .nl 1w.stichtingargus .nl 1w.stichtingargus .nl 1w.stichtingargus .nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus .nl 1w. stichti ngargus.nl 1w. stichti ngargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus .nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl -xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus .nl ‘w.stichtingargus .nI ‘w.stichtingargus .nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .ril w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nI xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.hl xv. stichtingargus .nl 5. 48 FELLOwCRAFT The Five Senses The Five Senses of human nature are: Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tast - ing. HEARING Hearing is that sense by which we distin - guish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the p]easures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires, while thus our reason is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge by the information of others. For these purposes, we are endowed with hear - ing, that, by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete. SEEING Seeing is that sense by which we distin - guish objects, and, in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structure, and all the agreeable va - riety displayed in the landscape of Nature. By this sense we find our way on the path- FELLOWCRAFT 49 less ocean, traverse the globe of the earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and de - lineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more, by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections, of our fellow-creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though th~ tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which minister to this sense are the most astonishing part of creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye and its appurte - nances evince the admirable contrivance of Nature for performing all its various exter - nal and internal motions, while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of ]ife, clearly demonstrates this organ lo be the master - piece of Nature’s work. FEELING Feeling is that sense by which we distin - guish the different qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, rough - ness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion, and extension.

Ani - mal anct vegetable bodies, and, indeed, most other bodies, while exposed to the air, con - tinually send forth effluvia of vast subtilty, as well in the state of life and growth, as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effluvia being drawn tnto the nostrils along with the air are the means by which all bodes are smelled. Hence, it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of de - sign in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continuously passes in respiration. TASTING Tasting enables us to make a proper dis - tinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the ali - mentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration.

Everything that enters the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by it we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the dif - ferent compositions of art, cooking, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. Smelling and tasting are inseparably con - nected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices.

RHETORIC Rhetoric teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with pro - priety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance, wisely contriving to cap - tivate the hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat or eKhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC Logic teaches us to guide our reason dis - cretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquires after truth. It con - sists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted or grant - ed; and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning and disposing; all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in ques - tion is finally determined. ARITHMETIC Arithmetic teaches us the powers and prop - erties of numbers which are variously affected by letters, tables, figures and instruments. By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given ±or finding out any certain number, whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. GEOMETICY Geometry treats of the powers and proper - ties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered, from a point to a line, from a line to a surface, and from a surface to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure, or an in - divisible part of space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, viz.: length. A surface is a figure of two dimensions, viz.: length and breadTh. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, viz.: length, breadth and thickness. The Advantages of Geomeiry By this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general, to arrange his soldiers; the geog - rapher to give us the dimensions of the world and all things therein contained; to delineate the e ,ctent of the seas, and specify the divi - sions of tlae empires, kingdoms, and provinces.

Again we are called upon to assemble among the habitations of the dead to behold the narrow house appointed for all the living. Here around us sleep the unnumbered dead. The gentle breeze fans their earthly covering, but they heed it not. The sunshine and the storm pass over them, but they are not disturbed - Stones and monuments symbolize the affection of surviving friends, yet no sound proceeds save that silent but thrilling admonition: “Seek ye the narrow path and the strait gate that lead unto eternal life.” The last offices paid to the dead are useful only as lectures to the living. By them we are warned to prepare for our own approach - ing dissolution. It is passing strange that, notwithstanding the daily mementos of mortality that cross our path; notwithstanding the funeral bell so often tolls in our ears, and the “mournful procession” goes about our streets; we do not more seriously consider our approaching fate. We go on from design to design, add hope to hope, and lay out plans for the employment of many years, until we are suddenly alarmed at the approach of the Messenger of Death, at a moment when we least expect him, and which we probably conclude to be the merid - ian of our existence.

While we drop the sympathetic tear over the grave of our deceased brother, let us cast around his foibles, whatever they may have been, the broad mantle of Masonic charity, nor withhold from his memory the commendation that his virtues claim at our hands. Perfection on earth has never yet been attained; the wisest, as well as the best of men, have gone astray. Suffer, then, the apologies of human nature to plead for him who can no longer plead for himself. The present occasion will have been vain and useless if it fails to excite our serious re - flections and to strengthen our resolutions of amendment. Let us, therefore, each embrace the present moment and, while time and op - portunity permit, prepare for that great change which we all know must come, when the pleasures of the world shall cease to delight, and be as a poison to our lips; and when the happy reflections consequent on a well spent life afford the only consolation.

The text contains nothing which would indi - cate that these charges were intended for an installa - tion ceremony, or any part of such ceremony. On the other hand, the entire charges would seem to be pe - culiarly applicable to the instruction of one at the time of his admission as a Fellow or at the time of his advancement as a Master These charges are suW stantially the same as those found in the Buchanan Manusciipt which conclude as follows: ‘These aie the charges in general that belong to all Freemasons to keep both Masters and Fellows,” and from this it is tbe more apparent that these charges were not in - tended to be read at the “Installment of Master” in the modem sense of the installation charge as a part of the celelnony prescribed for the installation of the Master o! a Lodge. Therefore, we accept Bro Dr. Mackey, the scientist, philosopher and historian, rather than Bro Mackey, the Masonic jurist.

Ye shall call all Masons your Fellows, or your brethren, and no other names. and Fellow Ciatts only lime, unless by dispensation.” Bro lirunimond says, Masonic 2’ewt Book, 203. “In 1125 it wus provided that a Master ot a Lodge, with hi~ Wardens and a competent number of the Lodge assembled in due Iorin, can make Masters and Fellows at discretion. l3etoie that, the second and thud de - gret~g would be conferred only in Grand Lodge, or by dispensation of the Giand Master.” The advancement to the degree of Master was in those days considered an honorable distinction and a preterment ot a Mason by his biotbeis, and it is reasonable to supposc that hl~ advancement was attended with some ceremony. We do not know what the ceremony was called, it may have been called “Installment,” and this may have been the meaning of the term “Installment of Mas - ter,” used by Pieston, though he may not so have understood it. Preston flourished three-quai ters of a century or more after these charges ate supposed to have been adopted In his time the Masters of Lodges were inducted into office by an installation ceremony and such a ceremony existed as early as 1728. In those days but little was publisbed ~n relation to Masonry and the purpose of tbese charges, being handed down orally, may have conveyed a wrong impression to the mint] of the Mason of 1772. and ]t is no answer to this that the word install is derived from in, on, and stallum, a seat, for a tradition in - forms us that there were 8,800 Masters installed as overseers of Ihe 80,000 Fellows and 70,000 Appren - tices engaged in the building of the Temple.

This clause has given rise to much discussion as to the possibility of women hay - ~ng been admitted and obligated as Freemasons. In view of the many errors, noticeable in the publication of some of these manuscripts, it is not strange that some copyist should have commuted this patent error. Refer to the Buchanan Manuscript (History of Free— masonry—Gould, 1, 100), and this clause appears: “The manner of taking an oath att the making of free Masons Tune onus ex Seniorehus teneat lihrum ut illi vel ille ponant vel ponat manus supra librum tune precepta debeant legi.”—here “dli vel ilie,” is trans - lated ‘he or they,” hut if one by error write “the vel lila” it would so far mislead the translator that he would read it “he or she.” we think ii is an error merely and does not tend to prove that women were obligated as Freemasons. There is no direct testimony as to the admission of women unto Masonic Lodges or Assemblies at any time, though they were sometimes allowed to partially reap the benefit, as widows, of a deceased husband’s business, if they had a Freemason to help them. The records of “Mary’s Chapel” Lodge, under date of 17th of April, 1683, furnish an instance of the legality of a woman occupying the position ot “dame” or “mistress” in a masonic sense, hut from the minute of the Lodge it will be observed that ii was only to a very limited extent that the widows of Master Masons could benefit from the privilege.

So in all doubtful questions of masonic law, recourse must be had, in forming an opinion, first to the Land - marks, and then to this code of Written Laws; and out of these two authorities, the legal dictum is to be established, because all the principles of law are ciii- ceive their accounts. If the Grand Master pleases, he may un due time summon all the Masters and Wardens of Lodges, to consult with them about ordering the grand feast, and about any emergency or accidental thing relating thereunto, that may require advice, or else to take it upon himself altogether. 25.

Many of the warrants for the es - tablishment of Lodges in this country issued from the Dermott or Aihol Grand Lodge, which is doubtless the reason why so much of the sporious Constitutions Is found in the jurisprudence of the several States — Masonic Jairis.—Simons, 20. 28.

(b) To piesent any difference or disgust which may be feared to arise that day, that no interruption may be given to the harmony and pleasure of the grand feast. George Payne, who on the 24th of June, 1720, amid the “customaiy expressions of zmrth, love, and con - cord” was re-elected, revised, arranged, and digested the decrees of the Grand Lodge hitherto issued, and formed the groundwork of that inestimable collection of the thirty-nine General Regulations, which in 1721 were approved of by his successor. Anderson, how - ever, was Commissioned, “to compare these with the ancient docuInents and vary ancient customs of the Fraternity, to arrange and digest them, and to pre - paie them for the use of the Lodges in and around London and westminster.” These General Resolutions, called “Ancient Regula - tions,” in contradition to those whIch were afterwards added, were made to suit the organisation of the"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"~O2 REGULATIONS OF 1721 (c) To consult about whatever concerns the decency and decorum of Ihe Grand Assem - bly, and to pre~ient all indecency and ill manners, the assembly being promiscuous.

Its only secrets are in its methods of recognition and of symbolic instruction. It is charitable in that it is not organized for profit and none of its income inures to the benefit of any individual, but all is de - voted to the promotion of the welfare and happiness of mankind. It is benevolent in that it teaches and ex - emplifies altruism as a duty. It is educational in that it teaches by pre - scribed ceremonies a system of morality and brotherhood based upon the Sacred Law. It is religious in that it teaches monothe - ism; the Volume of the Sacred Law is open upon its altars whenever a Lodge is in ses - sion; reverence for God is ever present in Lts ceremonial, and to its brethren are con - stantly addressed lessons of morality; yet it is not sectarian or theological. It is a social organization only so far as it furnishes additional inducement that men may foregather in numbers, thereby providing more material for its primary work of educa - tion, of worship and of charity. Through the improvement and strengthen- I!"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"~1 314 MAsoWIc Coou ing of the character of the individual man Freemasonry seeks to improve the community. Thus it impresses upon its members the prin - ciples of personal righteousness and persona] responsibility, enlightens them as to those things which make for human welfare, and inspires them with the feeling of charity or good will toward all mankind which will move them to translate principle and conviction into action. To that end it teaches and stands for the worship of God; truth and justice; fraternity and philanthropy; enlightenment and orderly liberly, civil, religious and intellectual. It charges each of its members to be true and loyal to the government of the country to which we owe allegiance and to be obedient to the law of any state in Which he may be. It believes that the attainment of those ob - jectives is best accomplished by laying a broad basis of principle upon which men of every race, country, sect and opinion may unite rather than by setting up a restricted plat - form upon which only those or certain races, creeds and opinions can assemble. Believing these things, this Grand Lodge affirms its continued adherence to that an - cient and approved rule of Freemasonry which forbids the discussion in Masonic meetings of MAsONIC Coos 315 creeds, politics or other topics likely to excite personal animosities. It further affirms its conviction that it is not only contrary to the fundamental prin - ciples of Freemasonry, but dangerous to its unity, strength, usefulness and welfare, for Masonic bodies to take action or attempt to exercise pressure or influence for or against any legislation, or in any way to attempt to procure the election or appointment of gov - ernmental officials, or to influence them, whether or not members of the Fraternity, in the performance of their official duties.

(406) Dimitted Masons.—The Lodge MASONIc CODE 471 within whose jurisdiction a non-affiliated Ma - son resides has primary penal jurisdiction and control over him, although his offense may have been commit ted within the juris - diction of another Lodge. It is the duty of the latter Lodge to report the offense to the former. Where more than one Lodge has con - current jurisdiction, the same discipline and control may be exercised by any of them. See Sec. 190. 412. (406) Offense Committed Before Di - mit.—Upon the commission of an offense prior to the granting of the dimit, such dimit does not prevent charges and trial by the Lodge granting the dimit where the details of the offense were learned subsequently by the Lodge, although the offense itself may have been generally known and the dimitted IViason may have removed into another ju risdiction, provided he has not affiliated with another Lodge. In the latter case, the Lodge receiving his dimit should try him upon notice of the offense from the Lodge grant - ing the dimit. See Sec. 190. 413.

(412) Must Report an Offense.—The Lodge within whose jurisdiction an offense is committed by a member of another Lodge in this State must report such offense to such Lodge, and upon its failure to act, should report the matter to the Grand Mas - ter for action. 419. (413) Grand Master Without Juris - diction.—The Grand Master may not take jurisdiction of a Masonic offense by a pri - vate member; but if he has probable cause to believe that a member of a Subordinate Lodge is guilty of a Masonic offense and that the Lodge having jurisdiction fails to take appropriate action, he may in his dis - cretion order the trial of such member for such offense; and if said Lodge should fail to obey said order promptly, the Grand Mas - ter may arrest its charter and direct another Subordinate Lodge to try the offending mem - ber. 420. (414) Grand Lodge May Expel.—The Grand Lodge may upon its own motion ex - pel any Georgia Mason, though not a member of its body and with or without the recom - mendation of the Subordinate Lodge."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"474 MASONIC CODS MASONIC OFFENSES 421. (415) Masonic Offenses. — The follow - ing are Masonic offenses subjecting the of - fender to Masonic discipline: 1. Violation of the moral law. 2. VioLation of the laws of Masonry. 3. Violation of the laws of the land in - volving moral turpitude. 422. (416) Hearsay Not the Basis of Charges.—Charges may not be based soLely upon rumor, without evidence of a specific of - fense against the laws of the Order. Such charges would tend to encourage slander and backbiting, themselves Masonic offenses. If any member, however, should do anything contrary to the good order, peace and dignity of the Craft, or by overt act or improper practices should bring reproach upon the Or - der of Freemasonry, he shall be subject to charges and discipline. 423. (417) Performance of an Official Duty Not a Masonic Offense, — A Mason who occupies an official position such as judge, prosecuting attorney, juror, mayor, etc., should perform his official duties without showing partiality to anyone, whether Ma - son or profane. Thus it is not a Masonic of- MASONIc CODE 475 fense for a Mason in the performance of such official duty to issue an execution against a brother Mason. 424. (418) Adultery or Fornication. — Adultery or fornication with any one subjects the offender to discipline; but where the woman in question is known by the offender to be the wife, widow, mother, daughter, or sister of a Master Mason, there is the added guilt of the breach of a Masonic ob - ligation, and the want of chastity on her part does not excuse the offender. 425. (419) Insults.—A Master Mason may not make improper proposals to the wife of any man, whether Mason or profane. 426. (420) Backbiting and Slander. — Backbiting and slander are Masonic offenses. 427. (421) Solicitation Prohibited. — Any Mason who shall solicit a profane to join the Fraternity, or who shall directly or indirectl~y make such overtures as would conflict with the spirit of the unwritten law forbidding such solicitation, shall be charged with gross un - Masonic conduct, and if found gulity, shall be punished as in other cases of un-Masonic conduct. r"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"MASONIC CODE 476 MASONIC CODE 477 428. (422) Failure to Pay an Obligation. —Failure to pay an obligation does not ne - cessarily constitute a Masonic offense; but if at the time credit was extended, there was a deLiberate intention to swindle a bro - ther Mason by fraudulent miSrepresentatIon, the offending brother should be expelled as a common cheat, although he should sub - sequently give a note representing the in - debtedness, which he should afterwards fail to pay. 429. (423) FaiLure to Pay Debt to Lodge. —Failure of a member to pay a debt which he is able to pay to his Lodge is a violation of his obligation. Scheduling in bankruptcy a debt due the Lodge is not un-Masonic conduct, but the action of the civil court does not bind the Lodge; and for non-payment of his dues, a member may nevertheless be suspended if not relieved by his Lodge. A member who borrows money from the Secretary of the Lodge, knowing or having reason to believe that the loan is actually from Lodge funds, and is unauthorized by it or some authorized committee thereof, may be charged for non-payment as a violation of his obligation if the loan is aclually made from Lodge funds. 430. (424) Disputing Correctness of Ac• coun t.—Neither of the following may be con - sidered as un-Masonic conduct: (a) disput - ing the correctness of a debt with a Mason if the transaction does not involve moral conduct, (b) refusing to submit business dif - ferences to the decision of the Lodge before going to law, (c) suing a brother without notice, or (d) taking advantage of what the law allows, such as taking a homestead to prevent a brother Mason from collecting his debt. Masonry is not a collecting agency. 43L. (425) Intoxication.—A member guil - ty of intoxication although only once, may be tried and punished. Drunkenness is ground for suspension; and, if habitual, for expul - sion. Habitual drunkenness is such as has become a habit, to be judged by the special circumstances of each case. Upon the discovery during the conferring of a degree that a candidate is drunk, pro - ceedings should be stopped, charges prefer - red, and the candidate punished. 432. (426) Liquor Business.—No Mason in this State is permitted to engage in"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"478 MASONIc CODE MAsoNic CODS 479 selling, manufacturing, or furnishing spiritu - ous, malt, or intoxicating liquors anywhere, for his own account or as an employee; but if he be a licensed druggist, and such dealing consists merely in selling by permission of law for medical or scientific purposes only, he is permitted to deal in such intoxicants. A violation shall be punished by suspension and recommendation for expulsion. This pro - vision is not applicable to an official who collects taKes on whiskey, but who has noth - ing to do with the handling or sale thereof. A change in the laws of the State does not alter this regulation. Nor is it a defense that the accused is no Jonger engaged in such business. See Secs. 143, 431, 466. 433. (427, 520) Action of the CiviL Court. —No action of the civil courts can affect a Masonic offense. Neither a conviction, ap - peal, acquittal nor settlement of a case there - in involving a transaction for whica a mem - ber is or may be on trial by the Lodge can affect or control such Masonic trial. A con - viction by the civil court does not dispense with the necessity of a formal trial of the offending member by the Lodge having ju - risdiction. 434. (428) Cipher Code.—It is a violation of Masonic law in Georgia to use any de - scription of key, cipher, or written work of a secret character. It is also unlawful for any member to give, sell, furnish, or to keep in stock in any bookstore or place o( business, the management of which he may control in any manner, any printed, engraved, typewritten, or written book, pamphlet or leaflet containing anything whatsoever per - taining to a key, cipher, or written or printed work of a secret character. Any member so offending, shall be charged with gross un - Masonic conduct, and be tried by his Lodge. Upon conviction, he shall be subject to ex - pulsion, or to suspension for a definite period, depeadent upon the gravity of the circum - stances. 435. (429) The Substitute.—The substitute for the secret word of a Master Mason may be communicated in only one way. ]t is grossly improper for it to be communicated in any other manner. 436. (430) Invasion of Jurisdiction. — A Subordinate Lodge which encroaches upon the jurisdiclion of another without a waiver, commits a Masonic offense, even though the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"180 MASONIC CODE MASONIC CODS 481 - two had arbitrarily, but illegally, agreed on a division of territory and their agreement was not violated. 437. (431) Failure to Advance.~Failure to prepare for and take degrees is not a Ma - sonic offense; nor is holding a dimit and refusing to affiliate. 438. (432) Carrying Weapons in Lodge Room.—It is a violation of Masonic law and contrary to the rules of decorum and com - mon decency for a member to enter the lodge room carrying a deadly weapon; and should he do so, he shall be charged and tried for un-Masonic conduct. 439. (433) Masonry Not Used for Adver - tising.~Ma5onry should not be used for ad - vertising purposes. Business caids bearing Masonic emblems are prohibited, nor should such cards carry any parody or doggerel tending to make light of any Masonic lecture or ceremony. A violation of this edict is gross un-Masonic conduct. 440. (434) Electioneering or Seeking 01- jj~e.~ELectioneering or seeking office in a Lodge is un-Masonic conduct; and it is also improper and un-Masonic to use at annual L elections, tickets upon which are printed the names of candidates for Lodges Offices. 441. (435) Entered Apprentice Withhold - ing Facts.—An Entered Apprentice Mason applying for the Fellowcraft degree may be rejected for an offense committed before his initiation; but no charges may be preferred against him for such offense, unless he con - cealed the facts so that his conduct amounted to a fraud upon the Lodge, such fraud being equivalent to the commisson of an offense subsequent to initiation. 442. (436) Charity by Misrepresentation. —Obtaining charity by misrepresentation is a Masonic offense. 443. (437) Refusal to Sit in Lodge.—A re - fusal to sit in the Lodge room with another member is not, in itself, un-Masonic con - duct; but if the reason assigned for such refusal reflects upon the brother, the party thus assigning it may be charged with un - Masonic conduct, if he thereby slanders such brother. 444. (438) Revealing Who Voted in Nega - iive.—A member revealing who deposited a negative ballot is subject to charges."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"482 MASONIc CODE 445. (439) Threatening to Vote Against Candidate.—A member who threatens to vote against an applicant unless the latter with - draws a pending suit or pays a claim is guilty of un-Masonic conduct. 445. (440) Willfully Removing Black Bal - lots—A Mason who willfully removes any black ballot from the ballot box so as to prevent a full and free ballot is guilty of un-Masonic conduct authorizing expulsion. 447. (441) Public Announcement of Con - viction.—Public announcement of the con - viction of a Mason is not un-Masonic con - duct, especially when the commission of the offense was well known to the community and lended to discredit the Craft. Publicity of such results may be effective of good. 448. (442) No Limitation Against.—There is no statute of limitations against prose - cution of Masonic offenses. 449. (443) Improperly Wearing Emblems. —It is unlawful for a Mason who has been expelled or who is under suspension from the Fraternity to wear the emblems of the order. (A misdemeanor under §106-9905 Code of Georgia of 1933.) See Sec. 409. MASONIC CODE 488 450. (444) Games of Chance..—.No Lodge should conduct a game of chance. CHARGES 451. (445) Basis for Charges.—Any Mas - ter Mason, although himself under charges at the time, who knows or has reasonable ground to believe that a brother of any de - gree has committed an offense against the laws of Masonry, may, upon his Masonic honor, make a statement, either orally or in writing, to the Lodge having jurisdiction 01 the alleged offender, setting forth the facts in reference thereto as he believes them to esist; and if written charges be preferred, it shall be the special duty of its Junior War - den to prepare and prefer charges and speci - fications therefor. 452. (446) Charges Preferred by Whom. —If no written charges are presented but only oral information is furnished to the Lodge as provided in the preceding section, and if the Lodge shall determine that the facts stated are such as should be investigated and would justify the preferring of charges against the accused, the Lodge should order the Junior Warden or some other Master Mason who r"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"48 ~ MASONIc CoD~ is a member of the Lodge to prepare a suit - able charge with an appropriate specifica - tion or specifications against the accused and present the same to the Lodge. 453. (447) Charge Defined. — The term charge, as distinguished from the term spe - cification as used in this Code, means a word or short 8entence giving the general nature of any violation of the moral or Masonic law— such as larceny, adultery, embezzlement, slander, habitual profanity, murder, drunk - enness, etc. When the offense is a mere neg - lect of Masonic duty or the violation of a purely Masonic obligation, the charge may be stated as un-Masonic conduct, or, in ag - gravated cases, gross un-Masonic conduct, if it can not be more specifically set out. 454. (448) SpecificailOn Defined.—A speci - fication, as used in this Code, consists of an elaboration of the charge by giving a state - ment of the time when, the place where, and the circumstances under which the offense is alleged to have been committed; the partic - ular words or acts constituting the offense, together with the name of the person or persons, if any, against whom the offense was committed. ) MASoNIc CoxnI 485 455. (449) Contents of Charges and Sped - fications.—The accused should be decribed by his name, surname, and the highest de - gree he has attained. The name, number, and location of the Lodge to which he belongs, if any, should be given. If non-affiliated, that fact should be stated together with his place of abode, and within the jurisdiction of what Subordinate Lodge the offense was commit - ted, and, if obtainable, the name and location of the Lodge with which he was last affiliated. In cases where a necessary element of the offense is that it was committed against a brother Mason, or against one to whom the accused owed a Masonic duty, a like degree of particularity- should be used in describing the person against whom the offense is al - leged to have been committed. The time when, and the place where the offense is al - leged to have been committed, and a gen - eral statement of facts constituting the of - fense, should be given, so as to enable the accused to know definitely the charge to which he is to answer, and to be prepared to meet the charges with evidence at the trial. However, technicalities of accusation are not to be enforced with that degree of strictness which prevails in civil and crimi - r"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"486 MASONIC CODE nal courts.

(450) Charges Must Be in Writing, and Signed.—The charges must be in writing and signed on behalf of the Lodge by the Junior Warden, or by such other member as the Lodge shall have directed to prepare the same; or they may be made by some brother without such direction, but in the latter case they must be accepted by the Lodge before any further proceedings there - on. 457. (451) Written Instruments.—Written instruments, where they form a part of the gist of the offense charged, should be recited verbatim in the specifications, and may be introduced by the words “in words and fig - ures as follows.” When the substance only is necessary to be set forth, they may be introduced by the words “in substance as follows.” 458. (452) Obscene or Improper Language— Where language or. other matter which is the basis of charges is profane or obscene, MASONIC CODE 487 the law does not require it to be precisely stated, but does require that its nature be indicated in general and becoming terms. If any words or matter improper to be written are involved they should be stated to the accused when charges are served upon him, and repeated when called upon to p Lead, and the fact noted in the record as fully as the nature of the case will permit 459.

If no cause is shown, or the cause presented is not sufficient, regular charges should be preferred against said member for un-Ma - sonic conduct. But where a brother is sum - moned to show cause why he should not be suspended for non-payment of dues, the pay - ment of his dues prior to the meeting is a sufficient compliance with the summons. 469.
