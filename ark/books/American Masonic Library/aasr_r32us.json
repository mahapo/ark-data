The Thirty-second Degree of the Ancient Accepted Scot - tish Rite stems from the Twenty-fifth and ]ast Degree of the Rite of Perfection. The title of that degree suggests its ]ater develop - ment: “Most Illustrious Sovereign Prince of Masonry, Grand Knight, Sublime Commander of the Royal Secret.” It may be said, with reasonable historical accuracy, that the basic elements of the Thirty-second Degree—the symbolism of the Camp, the signs and words, and the motto “Spes mea in Deo est’ may be traced back to 1758 and to the Emperols of the East and West— a Masonic council in France which assumed full control over all so-called higher degrees. 2. The Rite of Perfection of twenty-five degiees was biought to San Domingo by Stephen Morin, probably in 1763. In ICings- ton, Jamaica, a few years later—between 1767-1800—-it was ex - panded into a Rite of thirty-three degrees and the 250 of the Rite of Perfection became the 320 of what was to be known as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. 3. The earliest available ritual of this degree is in the manu - script rituals of the Rite of Perfection, 40~250, which Henry Andrew Francken eceived from Stephen Morin and copied, in English, in 1783. The original of this Francken Manuscript is in the Archives of the Supreme Council, 330, A. .A. .S. ‘.R.. for the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction, U.S.A. The title of the 250 of the Rite of Perfection in the Francken iitual is “Royal Secret, or the Knights of St. Andrew and the Faithful Guardians of the Sacred Treasure. Ne Plus Ultra.” Each member was called a “Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret” which, later, became the official title of the Thirty-second degree. I ‘There Is no ritual text, but the Camp is described in detail, with an oxcollcnt water-color drawing of the tents representing the pi’cccdfng degrees. Signs, words and motto are the same as used In the Current litulil of the 320. 5"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"6 Thirty-second Degree 4. In the early days of the Scottish Rite, between 1801 and 1845, there were few rituals. Degrees were communicated by title and secret work. The first conventional ritual of the 320 appeared after 1845 in an undated manuscript copied by Ill.’.Killian H. Van Rensselaei, 330• It contains elements of the 300 and 310 not yet printed in separate rituals, and the 320 section includes a march of the “Grand Army of Princes of the Royal Secret,” the capture of the neophyte by the Moslems, his rescue by the Knights Temp]ar, and a “Charge” by ll].~.Giles Fonda Yates, 330 5. In 1866-67, there was a critical and intelligent ievision of the 320 ritual—a military degree, precise, crisp, impressive, but excluding the dramatic scene found in previous rituals. In 1875, the drama was restored, but the rescue in the battle scene was by the uniformed “Grand Masonic Army of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret.” The 320 was now firmly established as the militaiy degree of the Scottish Rite, and an elaborate Consistory uniform was prescribed in 1877 which iS still in optional use in some Consistories. 6. The abuse of the military incident and the intioduction of “rude and objectionable features” led to several diaft revisions between 1887 and 1911. Ill..John Lloyd Thomas, 330 (Honnlary) of New York produced a stately ritual, without drama, but re - taining the symbolism of the Camp with a greatly improved text This was adopted as a tentative ritual in 1912. 7. The discussion of the 320 continued, due to a desire for the lestoration of drama, In 1916, Ill.’.John Lloyd Thomas, 330 then an Active Member of the Supreme Council for New York, prepared another ritual which Is still In force as the authorixed ritual of the degree. After a brief ritualistic opening of the Consistoiy, there is a Ceremonial SectIon with a condensed sym - bolism of the Camp, representing Scottish Rite Bodies and not the individual degrees, the traditional obligation, investiture and secret work and a stirring call to Patllotism. This is followed by an Allegory which portrays the vigil of an aspirant for knight - hood, his temptations, his spiritual victory, his supreme sacrifice— ( S 4) 4 Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret 7 and his incamation of the Royal Seciet. This ritual was reprinted in 1934 without substantive change. 8. The ritual of 1950 is anothei reprint of the ritual of 1916, with a few minor changes. The new introductory pages include historical notes on the development of the ritual of the Thirty- second Degree; a definition of an allegory; and an interpretation of the allegorical characters in the degree. A routine paragiaph in the Obligation has been omitted to provide fnr the insertion of part of an old obligation which ranks among the noblest in Fieemasonry—a paragi aph on the unity of Freemasonry, adopted by The Union of 1867, deleted in 1875 for some unknown reason, and now restored to its place in the degree. 9. The Ritual of 1978 makes very few changes but is an attempt to modernixe the Degree, while retaining all of the beauty of the original. Constans’ soliloquy over his armor, ap - proved for optional use in 1966, is now included. A portion of the Prince Commander’s speeches has been given to the Bishop, where they appropriately belong. Other minor changes improve the pace of the action. The official and formal closing ceremonies contained in the previous Ritual ale omitted. This Degmee should be the climax of all that has gone befoie, hence, the Consistory should be closed while the lesson of the allegory remains uppermost in the heaits and minds of the candidates. [I. THE HOLY EMPIRE On the flap of the 320 Apron is a double-headed eagle “sup - ported hy the flags of the Holy Empire,” and, until 1934, the letters II E. were attached to the titles of Grand Secretary General ,uid Giand Tieasuier General. Rescaich has not yet disclosed the oligin of the term “Holy Empire” or its meaning, though the question continues. It is possi - hle that the term originated in 1758 with the Emperors of the East and West. The “Holy Empire” over which this Council r L."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 Thirty-second Degree exercised Masonic authority was not a territorial jurisdiction, but an empire of philosophy and morals in the twenty-five degrees of the Rite of Perfection. Ill.~.Albert Pike, 330 in Morals and Dogma, favored an eso - teric interpretation. “The true Royal Secret which makes possi - ble shall at last make seal—the Holy Empire of true Masonic Brotherhood.” (Page 861) It is defined as the victory of the spiritual over the human in men, the conquest of appetites and passions by the moral sense and reason. (Page 855) I 1 ( Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret 9 FOR THE INFORMATION OF OFFICERS 1. The Ceremonial Section of the Thirty-second Degree should be conferred by the regularly elected and appointed officers of the Consistory. This is their prerogative and their duty, and Consistories are ui ged to choose officers qualified for their ritualistic tasks. 2. It is the privilege of the Commander-in -Chief to reassign ritual parts in the Ceremonial Section, so that each officer may do the work for which he is best fitted. 3. Innovations and non-ritualistic interpolations in the Cere - monial Section and the Allegory are not permitted. 4. The proper salute for Consistorial work, with the excep - tion of sword salute, is given by placing the right hand over the heart, fingers and thumb together and joined, then extend the aim horizontally, palm down; and then drop the hand to the side. 5. Attention is directed to the definition of an allegory and the interpretation of the allegorical characters of the Thirty- second Degree. See page 14. It is of the utmost importance that this section be read to the cast of the Allegory at the first rehearsal. 4 6 Those responsible for the selection of the cast of the Alle - gory are uiged to choose degree workers whose age, personality and training fit them for the assigned parts. It is especially im - portant that CONSTANS should be neither effeminate, nor too old for an aspirant for knighthood. He is conceived as a vigorous mili - taiy type, isot more than 30 yeais of age, deeply in earnest and not ovel -emotional 7.

DEFINITION An allegory is a veiled and figurative presentation of truth in which the characters speak, not for themselves as individuals, but for what they represent. It may be historical like Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser (1590) or moral and spiritual like Pilgrim’s Progress by John Bunyan (1678). The Allegory of the Thirty-second Degree portrays a moral and spiritual conflict and, though it is exempli - fied in a dramatic form, it has no historical significance. The Age of Chivalry lends itself to the purpose of the Allegory which belongs to no specific time or place. This permits the use of concepts, ritual phrases, action and music which would be anachronisms in a definite histori - cal setting. The sequences emphasize the literary unity and simplicity of the text, and attract attention to the spiritual lesson of the Allegory. 2. INTERPRETATION Each character in the Allegory represents an ele - ment in the moral and spiritual aspect of the struggle it portrays: CONSTANS: Represents every Freemason of the An - cient Accepted Scottish Rite, eager to serve Humanity but caught between self-interest and the call of duty. L. ( Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret 15 BisHop: A symbol of the influence of Religion in a man’s inner struggle with temptation. PLUNGE COMMANDER: The Voice of Duty.

It is not given to all men to bear arms for the nation’s defense, but every man may cherish his country’s flag with a devoted love, may sup - port his country’s laws with a willing obedience, and may so live day by day that the commonwealth shall be prospered through his industry, established through his fidelity, and honored through his integrity. Such service of country becomes possible only when the individual man, strong in the integrity of his pur - pose, develops his own highest manhood under the se - cure shield of civil, intellectual and religious liberty. Man owes it to himself and to his brother men to be his own best self. No obligation imposed upon him by church, state or society can as a last resort destroy the freedom of his spirit or abolish his liberty of private judgment.

(To Exemplar) Kneel again at the Altar. (Exemplar kneels, left hand on Bible, head uplifted.) The Commander-in-Chief advances to the Altar. In accordance with an ancient custom, as he speaks the words, “I now proclaim you he stril<es one light blow (+) on the Exemplas’s right shoulder, and four light blows (++++) on the left shoulder. Commander-in-Chief —(At Altar) To the glory of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and by virtue of the authority upon me conferred as Commander-in-Chief of Consistory, I now proclaim you, and each of you, to be a Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret, Thirty-second Degree, Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite. You are now and hereafter entitled to enjoy all the rights, privileges and prerogatives of this degree, and are solemnly admonished to fulfill its duties and its high responsibilities. + Brethren, be seated. Commander-in-Chief—Princes! Brethren! In Al - legory we seek to convey the truth. Man has the royal secret—the eternal gift of Cod— Love. It cannot be imparted to him by others. It was incarnate when the Father breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. Cherish this love as a divine attribute, a precious birthright, a witness that man is indeed a son of God. L. Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret 31 Blessed is the man who is so possessed by the royal secret that he will resist the allurements of pleasure, di~ - dam power which enslaves and knowledge which is ar - rogant, and be deaf to the call of selfish interest whcn it encroaches upon the sacred obligations of the Brother - hood of Man. Blessed is the man who, like Constans, hears the call of humanity, even when it is not addressed directly to himself, recognizes it as the voice of God calling him to labor, accepts it proudly as his accolade of knighthood, and goes forth in princely power. As the immortal poet, Lord Tennyson said, “To ride abroad, redressing human wrong; To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it; But teach high thoughts and amiable words, And courtliness and the desire of fame. And love and truth and all that makes a man. (From Guinevere, Alfred, Lord Tennyson) I pray you give serious attention to the Allegory of the ‘Thirty-second Degree, about to be presented, which will forever impress upon your minds the meaning of the Royal Secret, the eternal gift of God—Love.

Prince Commander—I greet you, Constans. He who would be a prince among his equals should put away all pomp and circumstance, all pride of rank, and here, in the presence of the Prince of Peace, he should stand in humility, clothed in the white robe of purity, outward sign of inward grace. Constans, is the robe you wear a vain and preten - tious adornment, or a token of purity? Constans—Not of purity, my Lord Prince Com - mander, but of a desire and purpose to live chastely and without offense among my fellows. Prince Commander—You have answered well. Is it your desire to be a knight, chivalrous in war, a prince honorable in peace, a friend and a servant to your fel - low men in all their needs? Constans—Such is my earnest desire. Prince Commander—You ask much; and most un - wisely if you be not steadfast. Remember how great is the fall of him who is exalted if he prove unworthy. Constans—I will remember. Prince Commander—Who stands sponsor for this aspirant? Knight of Lodge of Perfection moves to right and for - ward as directed before. Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret 35 Knight Lodge of Perfection—I stand sponsor for his Fidelity, my Lord Prince. He has labored fervently in Masonry; his work has been tested by the square, the level, and the plumb. His desires have been circum - scribed by the compasses. He has learned the Master’s word and has performed Master’s work. In token of my faith in him, I place here this cuirass (kw~e-rah4), that he may be girt in strength and stand staunchly against every assault. Places cuirass on dais before Altar and returns to his place in line. Knight of Council of Princes of Jerusalem moves to left and front as directed. Knight Prince of Jerusalem—I stand sponsor for his Truth. While some have actively opposed or tacitly avoided, he has persistently proclaimed and nobly labored for Truth. In token of my faith in him, I place here this helmet, that he may be guarded against the crafty attacks of falsehood and the evil blows of error. Deposits helmet at head of cuirass and returns.

In Charity he has borne all things, believed all things, hoped all things, endured all things.

In token of my faith in him, I place here this sword, confident that he will wield it manfully for the right against the wrong. Deposits sword and returns. Bishop—Happy is the man who has such sponsors; thrice blest he who justifies their trust. Fidelity, Truth, Love and Justice are the true attributes of a servant of Cod, and he who lives by these precepts will be worthy of knighthood. Prince Commander—Constans, you aspire to princely honor. Remember that such honor can only attend princely deed. Rank and title may be bestowed by others because the givers have been deceived by fradu - lent pretense or bribed by unworthy reward. In the same way rank and title may be revoked by the givers, because they have been misled by envious deceit or ma - lignant slander. But honor is above rank and title and is self-earned; the unerring and unfailing reward of true Masonry. Honor is likewise self-revoked, the inevitable penalty of disloyalty. From days of old, aspirants for knightly honor have been left in lonely vigil before the Altar of the Most High Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret 37 God—a vigil that is emblematic of that solitary conflict which every man must fight out in the secret places of his own soul, with no witnesses and no succor save the all-knowing and all-mighty Father of men. Constans, we leave you now to your vigil. In this sword and hel - met, shield and cuirass, behold symbols of all your powers for the service to which you aspire. Without these symbols of service, you are bereft of all ability to aid in our great work of making this world a Temple, a fit abiding place for the Grand Architect of the Uni - verse, and become only another weak object of our labors; a suppliant, and not an ally. Guard well your armor, For, in so doing, you guard all your powers for future good, all your claims For future honor. Faithfulness to this trust will prove your worthiness for nobler tasks. Recreancy will Forfeit all that you have won in the past, all that you may hope for in the future. Constans—My hope is in God. (Kneels by his armor.) Bishop—Our hope is in God. May He ever have you in His holy keeping. Basses hands in blessing. Constans remains in prayer. Prince Commander—Keep well your vigil. Constans, farewell. Organ march. Knights retire in order.
