It is the Grand Lodge's sincere hope that, by consolidating the information about our families' devotion to the youth of America, we have given t he prospective student tangible assistance in his or her career. It is hoped that we have covered all grants, loans and scholarsh ips of our related bodies. If additional programs become known to us, they will be added to this manual in subsequent issues. For The Adult Leaders and Lodge Secretaries We place this manual in your hands as a tool in counseling and guiding our youth. Information concerning additional know n scholarships, missing informat ion, inaccurate data, and suggestions for improv ement should be forw arded to the Grand Secretary as soon as possible. In the final analysis, it is you who will see this endeavor reach fruition. Your commitment to these fine young men and women is gratefully acknowledged and it is our hope that you will see this manual as a helpful tool in your daily work. A recent Los Angeles survey indica ted that less than 10% of today's college students work their way through college without assistance. Some 40% receive grants while another 50% use loans to finance their education. Although there may be some room for disagreem ent concerning these statis tics, it should be clear that the youth of today re ly heavily on the types of assistance offer ed in this booklet. Some person in your organization should be familiar with your young c harges' needs in this area and be prepared to encourage them to plan for their education early. The greatest gift you can give your young people is your time. Take the time necessary to become informed so that you may be a reliable source of assist ance to your young friends. Pick up the phone and call the Grand Lodge, or the Youth Order Committee, for assist ance. If you don't like the response from one source, call another. You have the right to prompt reliable service from your fraternity. Please use it. For The Youth Who Will Use This Manual The Grand Lodge of California wishes you the best of lu ck in your pursuits of higher education. Your adult leaders and the Youth Orders Committee st and ready to assist you in this new adventure. There are many details you will have to attend to in becoming successful in your quest. Plan Ahead There are several articles that accompany the actual lis t of available aid. Read t hese carefully. They contain sound advice. This will most likely be y our first attempt in making a major change in the direction of your life. You can take charge, work hard, and see this goal atta ined. You can also allow others to make the choices for you. Most often in life we derive fr om it what we put into it. Your di gestion of this material and your plans for attaining your goals are entirely up to you. We at the Grand Lodge know that you have the capability to make the right choices and we stand ready to assist you in any way that we can. For the Counselor Assisting a Young Student: The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Califor nia has a long and full history of supporting our State’s public school system as well as spons oring and funding programs addressing the well being and educational needs of the youth of our state. Please note that although many of the scholarship programs included in this manual list affiliation with one of the Mas onic Youth Orders as a point of consideration, many of the significant ones have no such requirement, or ma ke it an item of tie-breaker preference only. We encourage you to assist any qualified young person to seek those significant scholarships where past performance, current ability, and need ar e the significant considerations.

In \"The Wizard of Oz\", Dorothy's directions to get home were to follow the yellow brick road, find the Wizard and finally, click her heels three times and repeat, \"There's no place like home\". Today's directions for finding the right job won't take you down a yellow-brick road but they won't have you going in circles either. Pat Hughes, manager of the staff and organizational development department at the Bettelle Memorial Institute in Columbus categorizes those directions as the four \"Knows\" of successful job seeking. Know yourself. Know how to market yourself. Know how to use the tools. Know where to look. \"Look at yourself, you are the product. What do you want to do with your life?\" said Hughes, who administers career development and training programs for Bettetle, an independent research firm. Some of the tips she has found to help job seekers are tried and true. She said one of the first things you should do is ask yourself, \"who am I?\" One part we don't pay much attention to is to ask yourself what you need out of a job and then make a list of the things you do well. Some of the characteristics to look for are Positive Energy, the Ability to Work Hard, the Willingness to Work Alone, the Willingness to Learn. When it comes to marketing, Hughes advises job seekers to know the difference between marketing and selling. Marketing is a long-term program, while selling is a one-time thing. Hughes said in marketing, you have to find out what the customer needs and how you fit that need. She also said, don't be afraid to outline a course of action, because this is where we miss the boat in a job search, because we often sell rather than market. Tools used in job hunting are: the Résumé, the Cover Letter, the Telephone, the Application, and the Interview. The Résumé is the moment of truth, because it mirrors your skills and accomplishments. The cover letter should be targeted at the particular company, and a follow-up telephone call is in order so that you can convince the person you talk to even if the company doesn't have a job opening. Hughes said both résumés and applications should be filled out accurately and neatly. Courtesy counts as much as skills. 33"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" Courtesy Counts As Much As Skill NEW YORK (UPI) - Yes, you're well qualified, but you just lost out on a job. Why? Perhaps you need to master the p's and q's of interviewing, a top recruiter, Stephen Berger, President of Howard Sloan, Inc., one of the oldest job placement firms in the nation, says one can learn the etiquette of interviewing and make it pay dividends. For example, if you are asked an illegal question, such as age or marital status, you have a choice. You can answer, it doesn't bother you or you can politely decline and tell the interviewer you have no objection to the question, but it is your understanding that you're not supposed to. The average interview should take about ten (10) minutes, says Berger, and bear in mind that first impressions count. No smoking or gum chewing, and watch your body language, sit straight, both feet on the floor, don't stare, and watch those nervous habits like foot tapping, hand wringing or fingering jewelry. Let the interviewer set the tone of the meeting but be prepared with questions. It is also a good idea to bring up some personal details listed in your résumé, since interviewers read hundreds every day and cannot be expected to remember all of them. The best answers to questions are direct, brief responses with a sentence or two of explanation, if necessary, and to the point, Berger says, at the end of the interview, say thank you and follow-up with a short letter recapping the session and that you look forward to hearing from them, Berger said. Courtesy counts, and that quality is better than quantity, show what you do well. Research on your prospective employer is always a good move before you go in for the interview, she said. Once you have followed all the directions and implemented all the steps, you're ready for action, she said now that you've taken a look at yourself you know how to market yourself and you've put your tools together, you're ready for the hunt. For that hunt, she suggested a job seeker select a few companies, and zero in on those you want, and be prepared, be persistent and think positive. She also cautioned that very few land that first job on the first try, and learning to handle rejection is equally important. 34"}]
