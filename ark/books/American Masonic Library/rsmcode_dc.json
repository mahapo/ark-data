Power and Authority Section 11. This Grand Council is a body of Cryp tic Masons in whom is inalienably vested the government and superintendence of Cryptic Masonry within its territorial jurisdiction, subject only to its obligations to the General Grand Counc il of Cryptic Masons International. It shall have the power to grant c harters for Councils to confer t he degrees of Royal, Select, Super- Excellent Master, and Thrice Illustrious Master; and demand and receive therfor, and for dispensation, such fees as are hereinafter provided. It shall asse ss and collect from the several Constituent Councils such sums of money as the good of the Craft ma y require. It shall prescribe the minimum fee for admission into a Constituent Council. It shall estab lish and maintain a uniform mode of work. It shall hear and determine all appeals between two or more Councils. it shall exercise all such powers as belong to it by custom or the ancient constitutions and regulations of the Craft.

All questions shall be decided by a majority of the members present; provided , that on appeal, a two-thirds vote shall be necessary to reverse the decision of the Grand Council.

No Council, its representatives, or Past Master, shall be entitle to vote until all dues owing by said Council to the Grand Council shall have been fully paid or remitted. Decision The Grand Master presented the following two-part question to the Committee on Jurisprudence for its consideration and report: An Officer of this Grand Council is also serving as the duly elected and installed Deputy Master of a Constituent Council: (1). Is the aforementioned Companion entitled to more than one vote in the Grand Council, and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"(2). If not, then is his proxy from the Constituent Council entitled to vote even though the principal is present? Neither the Grand Council Constitution nor the Grand Lodge Code is clear on this point although a breakdown of the Grand Lodge voting practice provides one vote only for a Past Master serving as a Grand Lodge Officer. It seems clear that the Grand Council Officer should be restricted to one vote. It seems equally clear that no Constituent council s hould be denied the right to have an individual vote cast by each of its three Council Officers. Accordingly, your Committee recommends that t he Grand Council Officer be entitled to one vote and that his proxy in the Constituent Council, if present, also be entitled to one vote. (Approved — 1965 Proceedings.) Representatives Section 13. The representatives of a Council shall be its Master, Deputy Master, Principal Conductor of the Work, or proxies by them named at a Stated Assembly or each respective Council and confirmed by a majority of said Council; provided , that an acceptable certificate of said confirmation shall be filed with the Grand Recorder prior to t he Assembly of the Grand Council at which the proxy offers to vote for his principal.
