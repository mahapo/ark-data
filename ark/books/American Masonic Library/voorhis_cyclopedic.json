Printed in the United States of America Masonry is frequently referred to as a Fraternity and also as an Order. It is obviously a Fraternity and, too, it must be an Order for it is a body whose character is known, Its practices observable, its rules fixed, Its pur - poses declared, its utility proven and it has the protection of tree govern - ments wherein it exists. Its members know that even its mysteries would be honored if publicly revealed. No one is received into its circle unless Free - born and of good reputation. Its purpose is plain to all—to love God, serve the country, and do good to all. Its utility is proved by its excellent precepts, and the services it renders humanity. These things make a an Order. Whether the component parts of Freemasonry can be called an Order is a matter of judgment or opinion but taken, in a plenary sense, it has existed from time immemorial and its principles are immutable. Ma~ books have been written on innumerable Masonic subjects. Most of t~e~ have a foreword and/or a preface; and many of them also have an introdii~ztion. They frequently purpolt to explain or to give excuse for their being We offer no excuse for this volume because it is the first book of its kind—u cyclopedic digest of the physical portion of Masonic activity of all active gioups in the United States. We have noted, with amusement, in more than one Masonic book, a sentence that “this work has found favor among many readers’ ‘—surely an anticipatory statement, to say the very least. Our egotism ascends to no such heights, but such a hope reposes in our mind. If we have distressed you by listing our Masonic tides on the first page of this book, we call your attention to the fact that it is the TITLE PAGE, and that we have titles as well as the book. But we might have gone further as we have presided in more than thirty Masonic bodies, but we thought those listed would be suflicient to give us some authority in the premises. About seventy-five years ago a zealot extolled the virtues of a “rag” he published as a Masonic Manual, which he called, “ALPHA AND OMEGA”, subheaded “Treasure of Wisdom.” This knave had the unmitigated nerve to foster this “gem” (for which the work should become immortal) on an unsuspected Masonic public. ‘4 ~Vpp-, f~?~ I ~ ~"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CONTENTS “This is a n~anual, compact, comprehensive, compendious, useful, a among all bo6ks, whether they be more diffuse or less extensive compendiums, this is the one most often consulted, and the most readily understood; and although it is small in size and brief in arlangement, it is a sea containing in itself pearls of truth (gems of verities), and a treas - urer in which are deposited sums of subtleties; and Is replete with intrinsic symbolism, difficult to penetrate, and impossible to all except the initia - ted.” The external facts connected with the history of our Masonic organiza - tions have been set down elsewhere with considerable inaccutacy. This peren - nial method has become a habitual nuisance which I hope, by this work, to have terminated. If true, I shall have etched a small claim to Masonic fame —historically.

Perfection is not claimed, but an intensive effort has been made to check every statement in this work. For several years requests for such data have been icceived by the author and they are becoming mor~ frequent now since some of the little known bodies have become more active. There has been no single place Where anyone could secure information about all the bodies in the Masonic System because the material is scattered in hundreds of printed Proceedings and unprinted minutes and records, most of which is out of leach of all but a few students of the Craft. A great number of even the printed Pro. ceedings are extremely rare and inaccessible. It is to meet this increasing need for this unavailable information that this book has been compiled. Conflicting data and dates have necessitated extended research in some instances. Even after every means has been used to verify facts, there is the possibility of error. Consequently, any corrections, fully substantiated by reliable evidence, or additional material, will be welcomed. Because this is an original attempt, the edition is not large. However, if it finds favor, it is contemplated to issue subsequent printings, with additions, ‘when practical. For that reason we have not dealt at length with some of the groups, especially when their function is well known. However, data on any group not mention’ed will be gladly received for inclusion in subsequent editions. Due to the varied nature of the different groups the information has not been presented in uniform fashion. Each has been handled with the idea of presenting the most useful data in accordance with the contemplated need, and that which is most difficult to secure in normal and easily access - ible sources. EKcept for the statistical table we have not Covered Symbolic Masonry at all. Capitular, Cryptic, Chivalric and Scottish Rite Masonry also have not been given a full treatment, but the other groups have been given more attention—some of the information being assembled for the first time anywhere. The compilation of the dates of formation of Masonic Grand Bodies is frequently fraught with difficulties which cannot be explained without resorting to copious footnotes covering the situations, conditions and history. Organization dates often are different from “official” dates adopted by a Grand body. Some Grand bodies are continuations of Provincial Grand ix"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MASONIC ORGANIZATIONS bodies. Some such Grand bodies use the date when they became independent AND ALLIED ORDERS —‘others the Provincial date. Some date their being from the date of the Convention, others use the date of election of Grand Officers, and still AND DEGREES 6tbers use the date of installation. For the most part the date of election of Grand Officers has been taken following the practice of Gould in his “History of Freemasonry” (Charles Scribners Sons, New York, 1936 Edition) for Grand Lodges, and General Grand Chapter Proceedings for Grand Chapters, etc. Statistics, too, especially in the early years, are unreliable and only reasonably correct. Conferences and communications with various Grand Secretaries have been used to establish the figures and for the most part they are as nearly offloal as such statistics can be, taking into consideration the haphazard method of keeping membership figures in the nineteenth century. The authenticity of this work is assured by (1) the association of the author as a past or present officer in most of the active bodies of Free - masonry in the United States; (2) an association with, and memhership in, many of the Masonic research groups in this and other countries; and (3) a personal acquaintance with many of the foremost Masonic scholars of the Craft and a large correspondence with many others. Our “modicum of modesty” prohibits the listing of the multitude of memberships in the active Masonic bodies, but we believe they are sufficiently well known to testify to our authority in the present field of end~eavor. To list the sources of this material and to acknowledge the contribu - tions of our colleagues in Masonic research would take more space than a work of this size permits, especially when one considers that three years of research and compilation and the writing of more than 1000 letters were necessary to obtain the information here included. We, therefore, thank all who have supplied us with information of any kind, whether directly or surreptitiously. To soften the hearts of those Who may recognize their words or work in the pages which follow, we leave the thought that their product is the most desirable We make a single exception in acknowledging a debt to our printer, R. .W.XBrother Henry Emmerson, who, because of his superior knowledge of the art of typography and his colleague- ship with the author along the paths of the Craft, has given us the assistance necessary to bring this work into being. Finally, it is our purpose to make this work a “contribution” to those who really seek such information For that reason, it is neither a costly nor elaborate book but rather a handy reference work for the newly made Mason and research worker alike, within the “reach” of anyone.

S. A. Formed: The first Grar~d Encampment in the United States was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 19, 1797, the subordinate Encamp - ments being under the Grand Lodge of PennsylVania. On February 16, 1814, with the addition of delegates from Encampments in New York, Maryland and Delaware a second or reconstructed Grand Encampment was formed, also owing allegiance to the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. In the meantime, on May 6, 1805, at Providence, Rhode Island, a Convention of two Encamp - ments and a Council of the Red Cross was held. In May of the following year this “Grand Encampment” adopted a constitution naming the organiz - ation the “United States Grand Encampment of Knights Templar and Appen - dant Orders”, entirely ignoring the 1797 Grand Encampment formed in Pennsylvania. On June 21, 1816, the group met in New York with eight bodies being represented and enlarged their title to the “General Grand Encampment of Knights Templar and Appendant Orders for the United States of America” An attempt was made to corubine the two groups without success. Later two Grand Commanderres were operating in Pennsylvania, deriving authority from each of these Grand bodies. On February 16, 1857, in Philadelphia, these two Grand bodies combined and the Grand Comman - dery of Pennsylvania was acknowledged and proclaimed by the General Grand Master on June 20, 1857. In the meantime, during the 13th meeting of the “General Grand Encampment of the United Sfates”—on September 15, 1856 a new constitution was adopted, one change being the name to the “Grand Encampment of Knights Templar of the United States of America”, which is the name of the body today. Purpose: “To secure greater utility, better government, and to increase the prosperity and influence of the Orders of Christian Masonic Knighthood.” Degrees and Honors: 1—Order of the Red Cross 2—Order of Malta 3—Order of the Temple Statistics of Meetings and Grand Masters: Date 1 June 20-21, 1816 2 Sept. 16, 1819 3 Sept. 18-19, 1826 4 Sept. 14-15, 1829 5 Nov. 29-Dec. 1, 1832 6 Dec. 7-10, 1895 7 Sept. 12-14, 1838 8 Sept. 14-17, 1841 9 Sept. 10-12, 1844 10 Sept. 14-15, 1847 ii Sept. iO-14, 1850 12 Sept. 13-19, 1853 13 Sept. 9.15, 1856 14 Sept. 13-19, 1859 15 Sept. 1-4, 1862 16 Sept. 5-7, 1865 17 Sept. 15-18, 1868 18 Sept. 19-21, 187i 19 Dec. 1-5, 1874 20 Aug. 28-31, 1877 21 Aug. 17-20, 1880 22 Aug. 21-23, 1883 29 Sept. 21-24, 1886 24 Oct 8-11, 1880 25 Aug. 9-12, 1892 26 Aug. 27-30, 1895 27 Oct. 11-14, 1898 28 Aug. 27-29, 1901 29 Sept. 6-9, 1904 30 July 9-11, 1907 11 Aug. 0-11, 1910 92 Aug. 12-14, 1913 13 June 20-21, 1916 34 Sept. 9-10, 1919 15 Apr. 28-27. 1922 16 July 28-31, 1925 17 July 16-19, 1928 18 June 20-26, 1931 39 40 4i 42 43 44 Officers: Thirteen, with a Grand Master titled Most Eminent, a Deputy Grand Master and all other ofbcers titled Right Eminent.

The Order consists of a Provincial Grand Lodge of the Rosy Cross (R.S.Y.C.S.) and a Provincial Grand Chapter of Heredom of Kilwinning (HR.M. of K.L.W.N.G).

At some subsequent period the number was increased and the prerequisite a 320 Scottish Rite Mason. THE RED CROSS OF CONSTANTINE Formed: “In the year 1869, the Earl of Bective, then the Grand Sovereign of England, commissioned Colonel McLeod Moore an Intendant General with authority to introduce the Orders into the Western Hemisphere and in puisuance of this authority and through Various intermediaries Conclaves were instituted in the Dominion of Canada in 1869 and between the years 1870 and 1872 in various States of the United States. Before the Conclaves had really taken root independent State Grand Conclaves were organized in these States containing Conclaves.” (What Is The Red Cross of Con - stan/me, by Edward A. Glad, 1945). Purpose: “To draw closer the bond of Masonic union, purify the system of Masonic science, extend its limits, and increase its influence by combining such of its professors as are best qualified by character and principle, re - spectability and influence, genius and talent, to effectuate this great purpose. To prevent the perversion of its institutions and privileges to objects con - trary to, and abhorrent from, its original intent. To combat infidelity and treason under whatever form existing and promote by every humble means the social happiness and external welfare of our fellow creatures.” (W~alter Rodwell Wright, Grand Master of the Order, [806).

It Was predicted that a fif - teenth Would come into being but it was found that it hod not heen char - tered. In 1879, numbers 6, 7, 9, 12, 13 and 14 had their charters suspend - ed. They had eniolled 93 Knights before suspension. The remaining eight had enrolled 95 Knights. Actually numbers 12, 13 and 14 Were not operative and soon became dormant. Thus, in 1916, when St. Paul’s in New York City was chartered, it was given the number 12. ‘Why the next Conclave char - tered two years later was not given the number 13 instead of 16 is not known. The Conclaves subsequently chartered became 17, 18, etc. Conclave No. 1 was eventually moved from Washington to Pittsburgh. II.

SOVEREIGN GRAND COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES On June 1, 1875 representatives of all the Grand Councils in the United States met in Masonic Temple, New York City, N. Y. and esta - blished the Sovereign Grand Council of the United States. A limited juris - diction over the State Grand Councils continued but in 1891 an attempt was made to obtain absolute control over them by an amendment to the Constitution. This assumption of power met powerful opposition at once. In 1892 When Charles A. DeLaney of New York was elected Sovereign Grand Master, the Grand CouncIl of Pennsylvania withdrew and a few years lated the Sovereign Grand Council disintegrated. The following is a list of the meetings and those elected Sovereign Grand Master: 1 June 1, 1875 2 June 28, 1876 2 June 20, 1877 4 June 12, 1878 5 June 11, 1879 6 Oct. 11, 1880 7 Oct. 1, 1891 8 Oct 27. 1892 9 Sept. 15. 1893 20 Sept 14, 2894 11 Sept. ii, 1895 12 Sept. 22. l8~6 22 Aug 24. 1897 New York, N.

The various Grand Councils ceded their rights to confer this decoration to the newly formed body but the parent supreme body in England for the first few years of the existence of the Supreme Grand Chapter did not recognize such a right. In 1911, the Grand Council of Illinois withdrew from the Supreme Grand Chapter and returned to the original position of conferring the Grand Cross itself. This caused a bitterness to grow up in the Grand Councils altho there were two or three Grand Cross Knights who still stayed in the Su(preme Grand Chapter. One of these was George M. Moulton who eventually be - came its head, in fact the last Grand Sovereign. On September 20, 1921 the Supreme Grand Chapter merged with the so-called Empire of the West, but the Grand Council of Pennsylvania did not recognize this merger and resorted to conferring the Knight Grand Cross itself. The situation now (1949) is that the Empires of the West (so-called) and the East, are conferring the grade independently. Vermont and Maine, the only other Grand Councils remaining in an independent sta - tus are not conferring the grade.

Y. in caUing for a meeting in Chicago, Ill, the seceding group held two meetings, as follows: 7 Sept. 15, 1893 8 Sept. 14, 1894 Buffalo, N. Y. Rochester, N. Y. Calvin L. Stowell (N. Y.)

On April 17, 1875, through Grand Sovereign John W. Cook of this urirerognized Grand Council, Labanim Conclave, No. 6 was established in New Albany, Indiana, where two recognized Condaves already existed. Two days later Cook established in the same city four additional Conclaves— Fidelitus, No. 7; Constantine, No. 8; Eusebius, No. 9; and Jerusalem, No. 1 0. These Condaves established the Grand Imperial Council for Indiana on April 21, 1875 with George V. Howk as Grand Sovereign. This Giand Council was formed five weeks prior to the Independent Grand Imperial Council of Indiana but was soon declared illegal by the Grand Imperial Council of England. Nothing further was heard of it. The organization adjourned sine die on September 20, 1921 after vot - ing to merge with the so-called Empire of the West.

This history is by far more of a page consuming record than its importance warrants, as it concerns less than two hundred indivi - duals honored by the appellation Grand Cross of Constantine, more than half of whom never saw the Grade conferred nor a ritual of the same. In fact, some of those honored never sat in the body which honored them. From the very introduction of the Red Cioss of Constantin; in the United States, roughly seventy-five years ago, there have been heaYedopin - ions concerning who had the right to confer or/and control ,tfle Grand Cross. In the early years the state Grand Conclaves assumed thit right, but it was sparingly conferred until 1892 when a body known as the Grand Chapter of the Grand Cross became active, with the purpose of controlling the grade. This body adjourned sine die on September 20, 1921 and abju - cated its authority to confer the grade to the “Empire of the West,” so- called, and thus ceased to exist. However, the “Empire of the East”, so-called, had re-assumed such an authority, while the Grand Councils of Maine and Vermont, the only two other surviving Grand Councils, never conferred the grade again. The present purpose is to list all those who attained the grade of Knight Grand Cross of Constantine in the United States. The records are scanty, replete with errors, both of omission and commission, and unt rust- worthy. Outside sources have been used in many instances to check and correct obvious mistakes. In the listing below the date of the Grand Cross is a misnomer in that it is frequently impossible to determine if it is an election, a selection or a conferring date. The state listed refers to a state Condave or a local Con - dave in that state—or, in rare instances, when there is no state Conclave the state of residence is used. If, however, the individual held membership in either the Empire of the East or the Empire of the West, it is recorded by the use of “E” or “W”. Admittedly the list is neither complete nor accurate, but it is the result of an intense research in all available proceedings and records of the Order. So far as is known this is an original attempt to pre - sent such a list. The charter grade Knights were made prior to November 11, 1873.

Purpose: To consider, examine, and record all such matters as may come within the purview of the philosophy of Freemasonry, and those sciences embraced in it, as also those sciences which are akin thereto, with the pur - pose of obtaining verified truth in place of traditional error, of reconciling any apparent discrepancies between History, Myths, Legends, Philosophy, and Sciences, as em6raced in the study of Freemasonry. ‘To facilitate the study of the system of Philosophy founded upon the Kabalah and the doctrines of Hermes Trismegistus, and to investigate th~ meaning and symbolism of all that now remains of the wisdom, art and literature of the ancient world. To create a base for the collection and deposit of archaeological and historical subjects pertaining to Freemasonry and Secret Societies, and other interesting matter. To draw within a common bond men of scientific inclination, and authois who have been engaged in these investigations, and, as well, those interested in them, with the view of strengthening theit exertions by associa - tion, and of placing in juxtaposition the results of their labors for compari - son, that Freemasonry may be rendered free from some of the apparently gross contradictions within itself, its sciences, and historical myths. To promote generally true Science and the principles of philosophy proper, to the end that the members and those within their influence may be enlightened by the results of these investigations, either by published papers on subjects read and discussed within the Society, or by lectures, delivered under its sanction or auspices.

Y 11 Total 817 Membership was originally selected from those who were Templars, Scottish Rite Masons and Past or Sitting Masters, but the Constitutions of 1906 required only that members be Master Masons. There is no way to tell exactly how many were introduced into the Lodges over the total period of existence of the Grand Body. Most were in Maine where nearly 3,000 became members. Organ: N one, but Proceedings were printed and MSS. of those not printed are for the most part in the archives of the A.M.D. with which this body amalgamated. They were printed in MISCELLANBA, Volume II, 1936-37-38. History: The body was formed by the Reverend Hartley Carmichael, Rector of St. Paul’s Protestant Episcopal Church of Richmond, Virginia. He was born in Dublin, Ireland on April 25, 1854. He was assisted by seven other Freemasons, they being in possession of fifteen uncontrolled degrees allied with Freemasonry. Most of the subsequent members were taken directly into the grades and made members of the Sovereign College, until the trans - fer to Maine. The following subordinate bodies were chartered: 1. Olive Branch Lodge, No. 1, Royal Ark Mariner, Richmond, Va. February 11, 1892 2. Jonathan Lodge, No. 1, Secret Monitor, Richmond, Va., February 11, 1892 3. Oxford Lodge, No. 1, Royal Ark Mariners, Norway, Maine. December 5, 1896. 4. Maranocook Lodge, No. 2, Royal Ark Mariners, Readfield, Maine, February 5, 1908 (Name changed to “Kennebec” in 1910) 5. Half Moon Lodge, No. 1, Royal Ark Mariners, New York, N. Y, February 5, 1908 (Name changed to “Metropolitan” in 1918) 6. Freeport Lodge, No. 3, Royal Ark Mariners, Freeport, Maine. December 10, 1920. The first two bodies ceased active work in 1895. In May, 1892, the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of England chartered a Lodge of Royal Ark Mariners in Boston, Massachusetts, which for a time caused some dissension. The situation was later correcied and many of the members at - tached themselves to the ‘U. S. A. chartered Lodges in Maine. At the Convocation of January 25, 1894, the title of the body was changed to omit the words “and Christian” but the original title was re - stored, without recorded action, in Maine on January 18, 1901. In 1906, the Tableau of Sovereign Fellows was twenty.eight: Virginia 13, Maine 11, District of Columbia 2, Pennsylvania 1 and New York 1. In 1909, the Tableau of Sovereign Fellows was twenty-eight: Virginia 12, Maine 12, District of Columbia 1, Pennsylvania 1, New York 1 and Alabama 1. In 1933, the Tableau of Sovereign Fellows was thirty-four: Maine 26, Virginia 2, New York 2, Massachusetts 2, District of Columbia 1 and England 1. On July 18, 1933, a Union with the Grand Council of the Allied Ma - sonic Degrees of the U. S. A. was consummated. The Union was ratified by the Grand Council on August 15, 1933 and by the Sovereign College on August 24, 1933. 54 55"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Because this body was the only one which ever conferred academic degr~es—even honorary in nature—’a list of those conferred follows: Doctor in Universal Masonry— Demetrius Rhodokonakis (Greece) Henry James, Earl of Euston (England) Josiah Hayden Drummond (Maine) William James Hughan (England) D.

The other officers are Very Excellent and the Grand Superintendents are Right Excellent. The local bodies have nine officers, presided over by an Excellent Chief. There is an internal Council of Past Excellent Chiefs. The Secretary is called Scribe, History: The Order of Knights Templar in Ireland relinquished control over the “Green Degrees” after holding it for more than eighty years. In England and Scotland these degrees are also conferred but up to the time of the formation of the Grand Council of Knight Masons in Ireland, they were not conferred outside the British Isles. Great Chiefs Council and Sharavogue Council, No. 1, were chartered on April 9, 1924, and constituted the same day. Up to the end of 1949, fifty-four Councils have been chartered with a combined membership of approximately 1,750 Knights. All of the Councils are in Ireland excepting five, which are in the United States—with which we are concerned herewith. The first Councils in the United States were chartered by the Grand Council in Ireland on May 20, 1936, as follows: St. Patrick’s in America, No. 26 Monroe, N. C. Shamrock, Thistle and Rose, No. 27 Raleigh, N. C. Harp, Cross and Eagle, No. 28 Wilson, N. C. There was a combined meeting of these Councils in Washington, North Camlina on September 14, 1937, when they were constituted by the Deputy Great Chief, R. Ex. Sir Edward H. Burne, assisted by frye V. Ex. Sir Knights, all members of the Irish Grand Council of Knight Masons, who came to the United States especially for the purpose.

It was constituted by the Grand Superintendent on February 10, 1943. In 1951, the Gateway to the West Council, No. 58, Pittsburgh, Pa., was chartered. At a meeting between the Grand Superintendent of the Southern Juris - diction and the Officers of Paumanok Council, No. 32, on February 23, 1946, a boundary line crossing the United States f miFast to West, setting up the territory of the Northern Jurisdictio with twenty-five States and the Southern Jurisdiction with twenty-three S ates and the District of Columbia, was decided. These jurisdictions were subsequently approved by the Grand Council in Ireland. In 1950 the two jurisdictions were combined into a single jurisdiction. The membership in these bodies is small and is restricted by invitation. At the meeting in Washington, D. C. on February 23, 1952, called by the Provincial Grand Superintendent, the number of Knights that had been made in the United States was 152 with 10 having died, leaving a member - ship of 142, of which 70 were present. 1949-1950 1950- 63 62"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"HOLY ORDER OF KNIGHTS BEM~FICENT ‘OF THE HOLY CITY Chevaliers Biefaisants de La Cite Sainte (C.

Hij tory: This is the oldest oi der connected with Freemasonry which has a continuous existence. It was founded by Baron Carl Gotthelf Von Hund (1722s1776) in Germany in 1754. It consisted first of the six degrees now composing the Rite, but later a seventh (Eques Professus or Professed Knight) was added, but being unpopular it was never officially adopted. The degrees of the Order in America are those practiced by the Great Priory of Helvetia (Switzerland) in their Lodge of St. Andrew and Order of the lnteiior. Anciently the Hund “Rite of Strici Observance” conferred the Craft Degrees, which right has never been surf endered, but the present organiza - tions recognize Craft Grand Lodges as the sole authority for establishing and governing Lodges of these degrees. There are but four Great Priories in the World :—Switzerland, Francc, England, and the United States of America. In England the Order was founded by the Great Priory, K. T. and is regarded as their highest honoi~ to English Knights Templars, the~e being only about a dozen members, So jealously has the C. B. C. S. been guarded it has been only sparingly conferred. Until 1934 when our two Knights received the Grades in Geneva, less than a dozen English Freemasons had been admitted. ‘The Great Priory is composed of thirty-nine members (1950), Since inception forty.six Knights have been elected (eight having died) as fol - lows: 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1947 1949 1951 Total 14 8 1 2 1 5 11 4 1 47 64 65"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"GRAND COLLEGE OF AMERICA HOLY ROYAL ARCH KNIGHT TEMPLAR PRIESTS Formed: May 27, ~1933, in Raleigh, North Carolina by four Knight Priests.

On December 31, 1949 there were 153 active Chapters. The total number chartered since the inception is 306 Chapters. 74 History: Early in 1900, pursuant to a call published in one of the Manila (Philippine Islands) newspapers, a mceting of Masonic officers resulted in “The Sojourners Club.” Meetings were held in the MANILA TIMES office, Oriente Hiotel, and at homes of various members, twice each month. The earliest record of the Club meeting is April 2, 1900. Actually these meet - ings became the means of securing a Dispensation for a Masoruc Lodge, dated July 1, 1901, which was granted by M. W. Brother William S. Wells, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of California, F. & A. M. The first meeting of the Lodge, U. D. was August 28, 1901. The Charter was grant - ed October 10, 1901, and the installation and institution of the Lodge was held on October 14, 1901. The first dated meeting of the new Lodge (Man - ila No. 342—transferred to Philippine Islands Jurisdiction December 19, 1912) was on December 2, 1901, at which meeting The Sojourners Club presented the Lodge with furniture and jewels to the value of about $275.00. Because all the remaining members of The Sojourners Club were char - ter members of the Manila Lodge, their identity as a Sojourners Club was enve loped by the Lodge and there were apparently no more activities of the Club itself until the year 1907. In that year the Masonic Sojourners Asso - ciation was organized in Manila, it being, in reality a continuation of the former Club. Members of both organizations became scattered throughout the United States and elsewhere and in 1907 some former members in and about Chicago, Illinois, thought the need for a national organization of this type desirable. It was, therefore, arranged to have a dinner at thc Hamilton Club in Chicago, at which the proposition for the formation of such an organization was discussed. There were no minutes kept of this meeting but Colonel Unmacht’s records show the presence of the following General Samuel C. Stanton Captain F. C. Russell General Nathan W. MacChesney Captain Burdette Kelly Captain R. B. Innes Colonel H. B. Hubbard Major George A. Lyttle ~Major John L. Corbett Colonel Charles E. Jaques Major LI. N. McClain Major George F. Lee Major Otto F. Skiles Captain Arthur H. Leavitt Major John S. Bonner Lt. Colonel George F. Unmacht This was the forerunner of many subsequent informal dinners and meetings, but it was not until February 28, 1918 that a regular meeting of the organization was held, to which were invited all officers of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps who were Masons. The concensus of opinion was that a permanent organization be formed and this was done. The following ofl~cers were elected at this meeting: President Captain F. C. Russsell. QMC Vice-Preside’# Colonel Carl Reichmann, Tnf. Secretary Captain Burdette Kelly, QMC Treasurer Lt. Colonel George F. Unmacht, QMC - Major George F. Lee, on that evening, moved that the organization be known as The Sojourners Club, on account of the transitory membership 75"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"that no doubt would comprise the organization. This was the beginning ol the ptesent National Sojourners, composed of officers and former officers of the various uniformed services of ~he United States. At a meeting on April 9, 1919, on account of the continued growth and prosperity of the Club, the need was felt for the Club taking on a more permanent aspect, and a Committee consisting of General S. C. Stanton, Captain C. E. Roach and Lt. E. H. Lewis, was appointed to re-draft a new and permanent Constitution and By-Laws. The Committee reported at a meeting on June 11, 1919 and their report was adopted. On June 16, 1919, the first move to form a national organization was made and new Chapters were authorlzed. This meeting was held in the office of It. Colonel George F. Unmacht. Early in 1919, steps had been taken by Captain Harold E. Schlesinger, a member of the Club, stationed at Detroit, to form a subor - dinate body in that city. On June 19, 1919, the Board of Governors, through the Secretary, mailed a letter of authority to him to institute the Club known as Detroit Chapter, No. 1. On August 1, 1921 the form of Char - ter was adopted and arrangements were made ror a meeting of the delegates of Chapters at Chicago. There were then three Chapters, Chicago Chapter, the mother Chapter; Detroit Chapter, No. 1, Camp Grant No. 2 and Wash - ington, No. 3. This was the first Convention. The organization was chartered by the State of Illinois (certificate No. 1839) on August 1, 1919 as The Sojourners Club. Later the name was changed to National Sojourners, Incorporated. It was also incorporated in the Distiict of Columbia as National Sojourners, Inc. on June 20, 1931. HEROES ‘OF ‘76 (National Encampment) This is a side (fun) degree having local groups designated •“Camps’ attached to the Sojourners Chapters. Accurate records of admissions are not kept at the National Sojourners headquarters—due to the nature of the organization. On December 31, 1949 there were 126 Camps of Heroes of ‘76.

R. Clute, acting with th~ Masonic Temple Club of Syracuse, in calling a meeting of representa - tives from other Masonic Clubs in New York State. The representatives of the Masonic Clubs of Syracuse, New York City, Rochester, Oswego, Herki - mer and Auburn organized ‘The League of Masonic Clubs.” F. M. Brown, President and S. R. Clute, Secretary of the Masonic Temple Club of Syra- cuse, officiated. The formation was subject to ratification of the clubs form - ing the League. S. R. Clute was elected President and F. D. Clark was elec - ted Secretary and Tieasurer. At the first Annual Convention on April 19, 1906, the name was changed to “The National League of Masonic Clubs.” A Constitution and By-Laws were adopted April 18, 1907 at the second Annual Convention. The organization was incorporated on Sept ember 15, 1922 in the District of Columbia. Purpose: The original purpose of the organization was the “promotion of fraternal relations between the Masonic Clubs comprising it and to facili - tate the interchange of courtesies to visiting members.” In the revised Con - stitution of October 14, 1948, four objects are listed: (a) To form a National Unit representing Masonic Clubs composed of regular Free and Accepted Masons, subscribing to the Declaration of Prin - ciples set forth at the Grand Masters Conference. (b) To inculcate love of country and- faith in the ideals of which it is founded and to propagate Freemasonry’s great ideal “Universal Brother - hood.” (c) To promote a closer bond of fraternal and social relations between the member Clubs and their individual members. (d) To encourage the study of the fundamental principles and ideals of Americanism, as laid down by the founders of our Republic, through the establishment and maintenance of institutions of a non-sectarian character, for the promotion of Science, Literature, Art, History, and other depart - ments of knowledge and cultural training and more especially through the establishment of free scholarships in recognized colleges and universities throughout the country for the training of students in any course of learning of their own choosing.

History: The events leading up to the organization meeting which eventually became the National League of Masonic Clubs are as follows: The need for a Masonic Club was suggested by Ebenezer M. Brown on December 18, 1901 when a meeting was held with the idea that such a club might be formed. Another meeting was held on January 16, 1902. Attending these meetings were, in addition to E. M. Brown, Theodore Barber, William H. Covert, Charles E. Fairchild, William S. Farmer, Charles H. Reussow, William Rubin, Lyman C. Smith and Gils H. Stillwell. Lyman C. Smith was elected President and conducted many committee meetings in his home until the club rooms in the University block of Syra - cuse were opened and incorporated on March 25, 1902. On April 3, 1902 four hundred Masons were elected to be known as Charter Members. Six hundred was set for a limit of membership, and a waiting list was soon established. Brother Smith served as President until April, 1904 when Brother Brown was elected. He held office until 1907. Thus it was in 1905 that Brother Brown presided at the first meeting which later became the National League of Masonic Clubs. 78"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE ACACIA FRATER]NITY Fdrmed: May 12, 1904 by fourteen Master Masons, at the University of Michigan. Membership: Membership was restricted to Master Masons until the 19th Conclave held at Estes Park, Colorado in the Fall of 1931. The require - ment was then changed to admit sons of Master Masons. In the Fall of 1933 the requirements were again changed to admit (1) Freemasons, (2) Sons an~ brothcrs of Masons, (3) Any person recommended by two Master Masons. Organ: The official organ is the “TRIAD”. It is stated that “Acacia is the only fraternity, with one exception, whose membership is confined to those of the Protestant religious faith.” Statistics of National Conclavei and Prie.ridents: F—May 12, 1904 1—June 27, 1905 2—June 20, i906 3—July 1, i907 4—June 24, 1908 5—Sept. 16, 1909 6—Sept. 13, 1910 7—Sept. 10, i912 8—Sept., 17, i9i3 9—June 24, 1914 10—Sept. 1, 1915 11—Sept. 12, 1916 May 31, 19i8 12—Sept. 16, i919 18—Sept. 20, 1920 14—Sept. 4, i922 15—Sept. 4, 1923 16—Aug. 31, 1925 17—Sept. 6, 1927 iS—Aug. 19, 1929 19—Sept. 7, 1931 20—Sept. 1, 1935 21—Sept 6, 1937 22—Aug. 29, 1939 23—Aug. 25, 1941 24—Aug. 28, 1946 25—Aug. 26, 1946 26—Aug. 27, 1950 Marlan P.

Fairfield Raymond Harvey History: The Order of the Golden Key was first conferred at the first initiation of Beta Chapter of Sigma Mu Sigma Fraternity, composed of Master Masons, at the University of Oklahoma, on March 21, 1925, in the Masonic Temple at Norman, Oklahoma. The ritual was performed by Almond C. Fairfield, author of the same and the founder of Beta Chapter. Among the Charter Members of Beta Chapter were: Dr. J. S Buchanan, President, University of Oklahoma Dr. W. XV, Reaves, Dean of College of Arts and Sciences Dr H H Felgar, Dean of College of Engineering 0i"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Dr. E. E.

M. .W. .Charles E. Tedroew, Grand Commander, K.T. and P.G.M. M..W..Hal. L. Muldow, 330, Deputy for OkIa. and PG.M. Thereafter all initiates into Sigma Mu Sigma Fraternity received the Order of the Golden Key until 1929 when, due to lack of undergraduates who were Masons, the fraternity were forced to admit sons of Masons. Sigma Mu Sigma was absorbed by Tau Kappa Epsilon about 1932. Unable to confer the Oider of the Golden Key upon non-Masons, it was discontinued by Sigma Mu Sigma. Before it was discontinued, several hundred received the Order in the nine chartered Chapters. In 1930 Almond C. Fairfield, the author of the ritual of the Order of the Golden Key, distributed the present key which he designed to Sidney Brown of Florida, Willis Batchelet of Indiana, Chester Erffmeyer of Wis - consin and George Fairfield of Oregon, all of whom has received the Order in Sigma Mu Sigma, and formed them into a skeleton organization called the Sovereign Preceptory. Knight Fairfield initiated eleven in the Eta Chapter, Sigma Mu Sigma at the University of Illinois; five in the Zeta Chapter, Sigma Mu Sigma, at Purdue University; and twenty-one at Tn State College, Alpha Chapter, Sigma Mu Sigma, this making 42 keys out in the reorgani - zation by 1932. None of these were formed into going organizations and nothing more was done until 1941, when on November eighteenth, Knight Almond gave an address to some thirty Masons on the faculty of the Joliet Township High School and Junior College. Since then the following key numbers have been given out: 1932—42; 1942—9; 1943—1; ~945—7; 1948—7; 1950-—12; and 1951—3, making a total of 81 keys since the re - organization.

From then on the Order began to branch out so that by 1949 there had been Grottoes in forty States, the District of Colunvbia, Canal Zone and two Provinces in Canada—about 300 Charters having been granted. In 1949 there Were 214 active Grottoes in tbirty.five States, the District of Colum - bia, Canal Zone and two Provinces in Canada. The last numbered Grotto was Koom No. 99 in Rockford, Illinois on June 18, 1920. The following year the numbering system was abandoned. No attempt to list them is being made as the Order has an excellent book - let “A Peep Into the Mystic Realm” by Otto F. Hildebrandt, P.G.M., Grand Secretary, which has, among other data, a list of the active Grottoes.

History: The Supreme Council of the Rite of Adoption was a self-constitu - ted body, whose rights had been transferred from Rob Morris, the founder, to Robert Macoy, who continued to exercise them to the time of his death on January 9, 1895. On April 6, 1895 the Supreme Matron, Mrs. Francis E. Johnson, installed Frederick W. Hancock as Supreme Patron, and a repre - sented form of constitution, which had been under consideration for some years, was adopted. On February 18, 1897 a special meeting of the reor - ganized Supreme Council was held in New York and the new constitution was confirmed. The first regular meeting of the Supreme Council thus or - ganized was held on Monday, June 7, 11897 at ten o’clock in the morning in the Grand Opera House, Eighth Avenue and Twenty-Third Street, New York, N. Y. From this meeting the present Order is dated. The Ritual was probably written by James B. Taylor of Newark, New Jersey and re.written by Robert Macoy of New York in 1873. In 1876 it was published as part of the ‘~Macoy Manual.” The final revised edition was copyrighted in 1895 by’ Clara (Macoy) Claik, his daughter. At thc assembly of the Supreme Council in 1909, a committee was appointed to revise the Ritual. The Committee reported in 1912 and a Ritual was pub - lished by the Order, the title page of which states ‘As written by William J. Duncan, 33O,~ In 1915 another comn~ittee for revision was appointed and finally in 1932 a pew Ritual was declared “The Standard Work of the Order of the Amaranth, Inc., to be Practiced to the Exclusion of All Others” In 1921 the Eastern Star prerequisite was removed by request from that Or - der. There are now (1949) twenty Grand Courts, including three in Aus - tralia, and one each in Scotland and Canada (Ontario). 03 RECAPITULATION 102"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Statistics of Asrembla’es: (December 31, 1949) THE SOCIAL ‘ORDER OF THE BEAUCEANT OF THE WORLD Vormed: February ~0, 1890, in Denver, Colorado, as “S.O.O.B.” Following a suggestion by several Knights Templar in Denver, Colorado, after the Gxand Encampment, K.T. decided to ‘hold the twenty-fifth Triennial Con- dave in that city in 1892. Purpose: The purpose is illustrated in the ritual which explains that “Some of our Business to make this Society an attractive center from which shall radiate bright, joyous and happy influences ~ * to make life purer, better and sweeter for others.” Degrees and Honors: The first ritual was a brief one. Two years afterward another ritual was adopted from which the above is quoted. A third rrtual was adopted in 1913 when the Triennial Conclave of the Grand Encamp - ment, K.T. again met in Denver. This ritual interpreted “S.O.O.B” to mean “Social Order of the Beauceant”, which is a name derived from the ancient Knight Templar banner. There is but this single degree. Membership: Membeis must be “wives and widows of Knights Templar who are members in good standing in a legally constituted Commandery of Knights Templar, or were at the date of their deceas&’. Officer;: The Supreme Assembly has seventeen officers and is presided over by a Supreme Worthy President: the local Assemblies by a Worthy President.

Meetings were held once amonth at first, then twice a month, and finally each week. The immediate purpose was a Bazaar and Merchants Lunch given December 1, 2, & 3, 1891, at which over a thousand dollars was raised. Frequent dancing parties were given to increase the fund, until it was twenty-five hundred dollars. ‘This enabled them to donate a thousand dollars to the Triennial Committee, K. T., leaving sufficient funds for all expenses for the Ladies Headquarters, next door to the Temple in Denver. Since then excess funds have been LIsed in various charitable endeavors. In 191 3, the Triennial Conclave, K.T., was again held in Denver. This spurred the Order to action. A national organization was considered and on January 9, 1913, the name was changed to the present one, and on March 13, 1913, a new ritual was adopted and permission granted to confer the degree upon wives of Sir Knights during the Condave, so that they might return to their own States and organize Assemblies.

In the literature issued by the Order is found the statement that it “is founded on the birth of Chiist, and it is dedicated to the sublime task of ‘spreading the glad tidings of the coming of the King’ and trying to bring the World Peace on Earth, Good Will to men.’” The Order is wholly Christian.

Vierling, his wife and sister Margaret. They read, studied and interpreted the story of the Wise Men and the birth of Jesus. Feeling that this story was an ideal basis for a beautiful ritual, upon which to build a new and advanced order of Adoptive Masonry, Brother Charles D. Magee of Golden Rod Chapter, assisted by Sister Agnes Brown, Past Matron, and Brother Monroe A. Smith, Past Patron, both of Queen Esther Chapter perfected the ritual and at a meeting on September 23. 1894, a decision was made to incorporate. One of the objects of the early organization was to provide “an advanced degree or degrees in Adoptive Masonry, to follow the degree of the Order of the Eastern Star.” It was also so stated in the ritual. Ten years later it was again so stated in another application for another civic charter. From 1902 to 1910 the White Shrine was subject to a great deal of adverse legislation in the O.E.S. due to the unfortunate early declaration. In 1910 the idea of an advanced Eastern Star degree was abandoned. Brother Magee formed a rival group on March 9, 1895 but a court case in November, 1895, prevented him from carrying on with this group. In Michigan a group of the same general name was then started. They used a ritual more elaborate and beautiful than the original organization, written and copyrighted by Brother Magee, to whom was paid six hundred dollars. From May 28, 1897 to October 9, 1909, the two supreme bodies tra - veiled separate paths. On April 22, 1906, in Masonic Temple, Chicago, Illinois, a Committee from each group met and adopted a proposal for amal - gamation to be presented to each body. Illinois adopted the final amalga - mation plan in Chicago on May 23, 1909 and Michigan adopted it in Lan- 110 111"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"sing on June 23, 1909 (the latter with a vote 56 to 2). On August 20, 1909, Illinois confirmed the arrangement (this by a vote of 80 to 7). At t~re time of the merger (1909) Illinois has 21 Shrines, including one in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and South Dakota, with 3,698 members. Michigan had 19 Shrines, including five in Ohio; two in Wisconsin and one in Cali - fornia, with 1,669 members. This made a total of 40 Shlines with 5,367 members.

Knott H;story: Brother Charles Bard Hamilton, who founded this group, spent a num - ber of years meeting descendants of the Toltec race, studying such history as was available (the bulk of such history and records having been almost entirely destroyed by Cortez during the conquest of Mexico), and exploring the ruins of cities and temples that had been excavated by archeologists. The ritual was compiled by the Founder and later revised by Knights Ferdinand Voiland and Clement Smith. Aspirants are received as Brothers and Sisters of Charity and advanced from that point. The only Council organized is Topeka Council, No. 1, Kansas—the entire membership belonging to that Council. At the first meeting on April 12, 1904, there were 47 initiated. Two days later 71 were initiated and on April 29, 1904, another 58. On May 23, 1904, 13 were elecred and receiveti as Charter Members, this making a total of 189 Charter Members. Two Reunions are now held each year, one in the Spring and one in the Fall, in Topeka, Kansas, at which the degrees in the Cloister, Chapter and Council are conferred in one afternoon. The Grand Council was formed for the purpose of compiling and con - trolling the ritual; also, to charter further bodies in the future. Nb Coun - cil may be organized without first providing not less than fifty eligible as - pirants, not less than twelve of whom must be Knights Templar or Scottish kite Masons in good standing. 1—1897 2—1898 3—il 899 4—i 900 5—1901 6—190 2 7—1903 8—1904 9—190 5 10—1906 11—1907 12—1908 13—1909 112 113"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"DAUGHTERS OF THE NILE Formed: February.20, 19L3, at the home of Mrs. Mable R.

(Grand Treasurer) History: On February 14, 1903, at a meeting of the West Virginia A.A.O N.M•S. held at the McLure Hotel in Wheeling, West Virginia, the visiting ladies were entertained by the Wheeling Noble’s Ladies. “One of the Ladies, in the spirit of fun, came upon a rope which the men had used in their parade and carelessly thrown on the floor. They joy- 116 117"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"ously began to trail it through the halls of the hotel; othei ladies grasping the rope and joining those already holding on it. A parade followed, end - ing at the doors of the Assen~tbly Room. Then, in a saner mood, someone asked ‘why should we not organize a Ladies’ Shrine?’ The result was that isis Court came into being, being named after the mother of Osiris.” The early meetings were held in the homes of the members “but as the membership grew the privilege of meeting in Masonic Temple was accorded the Court. For a number of years the membership was restricted to the families of members of Osiris Temple, A.A.O.N.M.S., but the Noble’s Ladies in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, noting the ‘Dispensing of Light’, asked for permission to form a Court. The result was the instituting of Allah Court on April 24, 1909.” This Court admitted only ladies of West Virginia until 1913, when the Imperial Council of the A.A.O.N.M.S. divided the territorial Juris - diction of Osiris Temple and granted a charter to Nemesis Temple at Park - ersburg, West Virginia. This resulted in the formation of Hathor Court on March 26, 191 3 at Parkersburg. It then became imperative that a governing body be formed. Repre - sentatives from the three Courts met at Wheeling, West Virginia, on June 24, 1914, and constituted the “Grand Council of the Ladies’ Oriental Shrine of North America.” At the meeting the ladies from the jurisdiction of Akdar Temple, A.A.O.N.M.S. of Tulsa, Oklahoma, petitioned for a char - ter and Aaba Court, No. 4 came into being—Iris, Alvah arid Hathor having been numbered 1, 2 and 3, respectively, in accordance with their age. As of 1950 there ilave been fifty-seven Courts chartered throughout the United States and Canada. Four of these—numbers 13, 20, 23 and 26 are dormant. As of the 1950 meeting there were 15,592 members.

While Gizeh Council holds the charter of the Grand Body as well as its own charter, it is continuing to exist only to maintain a “Low Twelve” Club, a benefit which it set up to pay out to the last man.

The organization was very active in its early years but ~n recent years has not been very active. There is a nominal fee for admittance and a small yearly dues. “The initiation is quite rugged, with many steals from the Shrine.” Officers all wear costumes and there is a uniformed degree team.

Memphis, Teno. 133 U 4 History: ‘The Founder, Frank G. Taylor, was born in Middletown, Vermont on May 19, 1878 and died in Saratoga, New York on July 21, 1949. He went to Illinois in the early part of the Twentieth Century and settled in Oregon where he was Superintendent of Schools. He became a Freemason in Ore - gon Lodge, No. 420, A. F. & A M. March 11, 1908; was Exalted in Rock River Chapter, No 151 R.A.M.; Greeted in Dixon Council, No 7, R. & S. M.; and Knighted in Vermont. He served as High Priest, Thrice Illus - trious Master and was a District Inspector in Grand Chapter. Each year Brother Taylor returned to Vermont for his summer vacation. Upon his return a year or so before 1912 he conferred a ritual he had written upon a Brother F. W. Gantz. They then conferred it on some Royal Arch Masons, mostly in Rock River Chapter, No. 151, where Companion Taylor believed such a “play-house” would eliminate horse-play in the Chapter itself. Fin - ally, on October 15, 1912, a charter was issued for “Liberty Hill Order, No. 1” at Oregon. On October 13, 1913, Lincoln Park Order, No. 2 was Chartered in Chicago and shortly thereaCter a state Order was formed. After more than fifteen years of operating, at the insistant request of Blue Lodge Masons, the Founder issued an edict changing the requirements of mem - bership from Royal Arch Masons to Master Masons. The Grand Order was established in Illinois, which body has issued all charters since— it being virtually the national body. On June 17, 1943, the Founder requested that he retire as the head of the Grand Order and Ernest M. Campbell, now P.G.H.P.; P.G.I.M.; Grand Captain General of the Grand Commandery of Illinois, K. T.; and Past Prior of Illinois Priory, No. 11, Knights oC the York Cross of Honour, was chosen to head the ‘Grand Order, and has continued such to date. The statistics of the charters issued are: Illinois 71; Missouri 6; Vermont, Indiana, Arkansas—3 each; New Jersey and Wisconsin—2 each; and Louis - iana, New York and Tennessee—i each. Thi~ is a total of 93 charters issued of which 61 are now active. The membership figures cannot be given as only registrations are made in the Grand Body—all being Life Members. How - ever, the following numbers have been initiated: 1912-1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 13,320 2,907 4,137 4,120 4,638 3,193 4,024 2,759 2,486 3,086 1951 1952 (June) It might be mentioned that Frank G.

Purposes “Furthering the spirit of friendship arid lending a helping hand when needed” among deaf men whose close relatives are Freemasons. Degrees and Honors: Initiatory Oflicer;: Nine headed by a Worthy Master. Qualifications: ‘Only deaf men of good moral character, . who can show close relationship to a Master Mason in good standing now, or at the time of his death, are eligible for membership.” Statistics: Seattle (Washington) Lodge No. 1 Los Angeles (California) Lodge No. 2 Seattle Hollywood Hiitory: A small group of deaf men met in the Secietary’s office of the Masonic Temple in Puyallup, Washington, on March 31, 1946. They were Hugo 1-lolcombe, Asitley Reeves, Carl Spencer, John Bodley, LeEoy Brad- bury and N. C. Garrison. Prominent Masons in Seattle and Puyallup became interested, and the use of the Masonic Lodge Rooms in the Scottish Rite Temple were given the new organization. Rules were adopted and first officers chosen on April 20, 1946. “Desomic News”, Vol. 1, No. 1, dated March 1952, published by the Desorn~ (Deaf Sons of Master Masons) in Seattle, Washington is their official organ. ‘33 ‘33 ROYAL ARK MARINER LODGES There are two Lodges of Royal Ark Mariners active in the United States, These are left out of six chartei ed by the Sovereign College in the United States and one by the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons in Eng - land. (see page 55), Oxford Lodge, No. 1 of Norway, Maine was chartered on December 5, 1896 and Half Moon Lodge, No. 1 of New York, New York was chartered on February 5, 1908. ~Both are now under the control of the Grand Council ol Allied Masonic Degrees. It~ MARK MASTER LODGES There are two Mark Lodges active in the United States out of many such Lodges chartered. There have been none chartered during the last hundred years. Girard Mark Lodge, No. 214 was chaitered on January 15, 1847 and Excelsior Lodge, No. 216 was chartered on May 15, 1854. Both of these Lodges were chartered by the Grand Chapter of Pennsylvania, R.A.M. To give some idea as -to the number of these Lodges chartered, the number so far found in three States will suffice: New Jersey Pennsylvania New York 2 chartered by the G.G.C. (1811) 83 including 3 in Vermont (1798.1819) 23 1812-1854 It might be noted - that there were also two Most Excellent Master Lodges chartered by the Grand Chapter of Pennsylvania—one in Philadel - phia in 1827 and one in Landisburg in 1828. Both had a very short life. 3333 134 135"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"MISCELLANEOUS PRINCE HALL NEGRO MASONIC LODGES 1950 There are a few local Masonic groups about has been forthcoming.
