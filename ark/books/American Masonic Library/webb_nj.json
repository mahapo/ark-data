Tie TWENTY-FOUR INCH GAUGE is an instrument used by operative masons to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it symbolically for the more noble and glorious pur - pose of dividing our time.

The COMMON GAVEL LS an instrument used by operative masons to break off tie corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for tie builder’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught by its symbolism to divest our hearts and consciences of all tie vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spiritual building— “that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.~~ ~ br, it is alw bn +~ estin aing (~)s to dmd % ev nwly initd bin, sin mm o intle sub, nt fin its intre wti o vI, bt ttimtbldupiAl arcvs%-~::a5a minri tt il id bn thrin ind a @~‘; hv u any sch tig abt u.

A Masonic lodge consists of a suffi - cient number of Freemasons, assem - bled in a proper place, having the Holy Bibie, tie Square and Compasses, and a Warrant issued by a Grand Lodge by virtue of which they are empowered to meet, transact business, and do Masonic work.

Its dimensions, from East to West and from North to South, embrace every nation and every clime. Its universal chain of friendship en - circles every portion of tie human family, and its influence beams where- ever civilization extends.

The universe is tie tempie of the Deity Whom we serve, and Wis - dom, Strength, and Beauty are about His throne as pillars of His work; for His wisdom is infinite, His strength is oinnipotent, and His beauty shines forth through all His creation in sym - metry and order. Its cove ring is no less than the clouded canopy, or star-decked heaven, which constantly reminds us of that heaven which all good Masons hope at last to reach by means of that sym - bolical ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw extending from earth to heaven, the three principal rounds of which are denominated FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY. These admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity towards all mankind. The greatest of these is CHARITY; for faith is iost in sight, hope ends in fruition, but charity extends beyond the grave, through the reams of eternity. boundiess The furniture of a lodge consists of tie HOLY BIBLE, SQUARE AND COM - PASSES, and a WARRANT. The Bible is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man ~ on i w oblgt Ms; the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compasses to tie Craft, because, by due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe their desires, and keep their passions with - in due bounds. The Ornaments of a lodge are the MosAIc PAVEMENT, the INDENTED TES - SEL and the BLAZING STAR. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Tem - ple; and the Indented Tessel, of that beautifui tessellated border which sur - rounded it."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"46 47 The Mosaic Pavement is emblema - tical of human life, checkered with good and evil.

The first renders us affection - ate and kind; the second, generous; and tie third, just. Brotherly love induces us to regard tie whole human species, the high and the low, the rich and the poor, as one family, who, created by one Almighty Parent, should aid, support and pro - tect one another. Masonry thus unites, in true friendship, men of every coun - try, sect and opinion. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent upon all men, but particu - larly upon Masons, who are linked to. - gether by an indissoluble chain of sin - cere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with them in their mis - fortune, to compassionate their mise - ries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. Truth is a divine attribute, and tie foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate and, by its dictates, en - deavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principie, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and piain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and the tongue join in promoting each other’s w&fare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity.

Bodies of water deluge him with rain, oppress him with hail and drown hun with inundations. Air rushes in storms and whirls in tempests. Fire causes the earthquake, and lights up the volcano; but earth, ever kind and indulgent, is subservient to his wishes. Though con - stantly taxed to furnish the luxuries and the necessaries of life, it never refuses its accustomed yield, but spreads his path with flowers and his table with plenty, and returns, with interest, every good committed to its care; and when man is called unon to pass through tie “valley of tie shadow of death,” it once more receives him, and covers his remains within its bosom. This admonishes us that from earth we came, and to earth we must shortly return."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"56 57 E. A. CHARGE Brother B, as you are now intro - duced into the first principles of Free - masonry, I congratulate you upon be - ing accepted into this ancient and honorable Fraternity. Ancient, in hav - ing subsisted from time immemorial; and honorable, in tending so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever founded on a better principle, or raised on a more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules or more use - ful maxims laid down than are incul - cated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been encouragers and pro - moters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, extend its privileges and patronize its assemblies. There are three great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to incul - cate: — to God, to your neighbor, and to yourself. To God, in never mention - ing His name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; in imploring His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and in esteeming Him as the chief good; to your neighbor, in acting upon tie square, and in doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you; and to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your profession. Tie observance of these duties will entitle you to public and private esteem. In tie State, you are to be a quiet and peaceable citizen, true to your gov- ernment and lust to your country. You are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but~ patiently to submit to legal authority, and to conform with cheerfulness to the government of tie"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"59 58 country in which you live. In your out - ward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institu - tion to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. During your leisure hours, that you inay improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be to receive, in - struction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolate the mysteries of tie Fraternity, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and to mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being init - iated into Masonry, be particularly careful not to recommend hun, unless you are convinced that he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory and reputation of the Institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. E. A. RECEPTION ADDRESS My Brother, we now receive you into this great Brotherhood as an Entered Apprentice Mason, earnestly hoping that the faith in God which you have here professed may ever remain unfal - tering and steadfast; that the Divine aid and blessing invoked for you upon your present undertaking may attend and direct all your actions through life, and enable you so to practice the pre - cepts here enjoined as to dignify your character as a man, and to honor your profession as a Mason."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"60 61 Ex- As an E~i~,wnc Cdt-Fin-n ::%Al H cm u.

The Twenty-four Inch Gauge is an instrument used by operative masons to measure and iay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it symboiicaiiy for the more noble and glorious pur - pose of dividing our time. Being divided into twenty-four equal paints, it is emblematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, where- by are found eight hours for the serv - ice of God, and of a distressed worthy brother, eight for our usual vocations, and eight for refreshment and sleep. The Common Gavel is an instrument used by operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught by its symbolism to divest our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spiritual building—”that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” Qtthnfld.

Operative Masonry is the proper application of the useful rules of archi - tecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings, and convenient shelters from the vicis - situdes and incleinencies of seasons; and while it displays the effects of huinan wisdom, as well in the choice, as in the arrangement of the materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that industry and a love of science are implanted in man, for the best, most salutary and most bene - ficent purposes. By Speculative Masonry, we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligation to pay that homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happi - uies’s. It leads the contemplative to view, with re’~zerence and admiration, the glorious works of creation, ahd in - spires them with the most exalted"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"92 93 ideas of the perfection of their Divine Creator. Our ancient brethren worked in Operative as well as in Speculative Masonry and, according to tradition, wrought at the building of King Solo - inon ‘s Temple. As God created the heaven and the earth in six days, and rested on the seventh, so they observed this as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportu - nities to contemplate the glorious works of creation, and to adore their great Creator.

By ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE is meant a regular arrangement of the project - ing parts of a building, especially of the columns, so as to form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, they first placed trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected the trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally pro - ceeded the more improved art of architecture. THE TUSCAN ~5 the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. The simplicity of this column renders it preferable where ornament would be supe rfluo us. THE DORIC is plain and natural. It is also the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where chiefly strength and a noble simplicity are required. The Done is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. The Tuscan precedes the D~orie in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in its original state. THE IONIC 15 a mean between the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"96 97 more solid and the more delicate orders. Both delicacy and ingenuity are dis - played in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this order. It is said to have been foinined after the model of a young woman of beautiful shape, with her hair dressed, as a contrast to the Done order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man. THE CORINTHIAN is the richest of the five orders, and is deemed a master - piece of art. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth, by Calliinachus, who is said to have conceived the idea of the capital of this pillar from the following remarkable circumstance: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young woman, he perceived a basket of toys, covered with a tile, placed over an acanthus root. As the branches grew up, they encompassed the basket, until, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction, and bent downwards. Callimachus, impressed by the object, set about imitating the figure. The vase of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus, the tile; arid the volutes, the bending leaves. THE COMPOSITE is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. This pillar is generally found in buildings ~where strength, elegance and beauty are displayed. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corin - thian, and the volutes of the Ionic. The original orders of architecture are no more than three, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which were in - vented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Done, and the Coinposite, which was more ornamental, if not more heauti - ful, than the Cdrinthian. The first three only show invention and particular character, and essentially differ one from another; the two others have"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"I 98 nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Done in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Corinthian modified by the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, are we indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in architecture.

The wise and bene - ficent Author of nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge from intercourse with each other. SEEING is that sense by which we observe the variety displayed in the landscape of nature and in the works of man. By it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affee - 99 tions of our fellow creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be false and deceitful, the countenance will dis - play the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. FEELING 15 that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, smoothness and solidity. SMELLING 15 that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various~ kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. By it we are frequently ad - monished to avoid the influence of things pernicious to health, or to select those which have been wisely designed for our enjoyment or comfort. TASTING enables us to make a proper discrimination in the choice of our food, and to distinguish that which is wholesome froin that which is in - jurious.

It unravels, as it were, the ‘thread of which the web of language is composed, and without it, it is impossible to speak with pro - priety, precision, or purity. RHETORIC is the art of speaking elo - quently, of being persuasive and com - manding; and not only of pleasing the fancy, but of appealing both to the understanding and to the heart. LOGIC directs us how to form clear and distinct ideas of things, and there - by prevents us from being misled by their similitude. This science ought to 101 be cultivated as an invaluable aid in our inquiries, especially when in pur - suit of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons. ARITHMETIC is the art of numbering, or that part of mathematics which con - siders the properties of numbers in general. All the works of the Almighty are made in number, weight and meas - ure. Therefore, to understand them rightly, we ought to understand arith - metical calculations. The greater ad - varicement we make in mathematical science, the more capable we shall be of considering the ordinary objects of our conception, and the more easily led to a comprehensive knowledge of our great Creator, and the works of creation. GEOMETRY treats of magnitudes in general where~ length, breadth and thickness are considered, from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a solid."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"102 103 A point is an indivisible part of space. A line is a figure of one dimension— namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two di - mensions—namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimen - sions—nainely, length, breadth and thickness. By this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general to arrange his soldiers; the engineer to mark out ground for encampments; the geographer to give us a description of the world, delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of em - pires, kingdoms and provinces. By it, the astronomer, also, is enabled to make his observations, and to ascer - tain the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. Thus, geometry forms the basis of many of the most important arts and sciences. J MUsIC 1S that elevated science which affects the passions by sound. There are few who have not felt the charms of music, and acknowledged its expres - sions to be intelligible to the heart. It is a language of delightful sensation, far more eloquent than words; it touches and gently agitate’s the pas - sions; it wraps us in melancholy, or elevates us in joy; it melts us in tender - ness, or ex~eites us to war. It is truly congenial to the nature of man for, by its powerful charms, the most discor - dant passions may be subdued. ASTRONOMY ~5 that sublime science which inspires the contemplative mind to soar aloft, and read in the heavens the wisdom, strength and beauty of the great Creator. “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament ~howeth his handiwork.”, How nobly eloquent of the Deity is the celestial hemisphere, spangled with the most magnificent heralds of His a"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"104 105 infinite glory!

GEOMETRY, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Freemasonry is erected. By geometry we may curiously trace nature through her various windings, to her inost concealed re - cesses. By it we discover the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the wonderful proportions of this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their respec - tive orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of the seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Num - berless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, controlled by the same unerring law. A survey of nature, and the observa - tion of her beautiful proportions, first induced man to imitate the divine plan, and to study symmetry and order. This gave rise to society, and birth to every useful art.

The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste arid destroyed many valuable monuments of antiq - uity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the temple of Solomon, so spa - cious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of bar - barous force. Freemasonry, notwith - standing, has still survived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. Tools and implements of architecture, and symbolic emblems most expressive, are selected by the Fraternity to imprint, upon the mind, wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, are trans - mitted, unimpaired, the most excellent tenets of our Institution.

As we advance in its mysteries, we find that a proper knowledge of it can be acquired only with time, pa- • tienee and application, and that our 135 appreciation of its sublime principles will be in proportion to our fidelity in observing its precepts. When, with faltering steps, you passed the portals of our mystic temple, the moral obligations of man were presented to your view, and you were instructed in the duty you owe to God, to your neighbor and to your - self. You were next inducted into the mysteries of moral and physical science, and taught to revere the good - ness and majesty of the Creator by a contemplation of His wondrous works. The lesson of the present hour is of still deeper and more abiding interest, one which human wisdom alone will not suffice to teach, for it points to the darkness of death, the obscurity of the grave, the resurrection of the dead, the immortality of the soul, and the power and the triumph of an unf alter - ing faith in God.

Sacred history informs us that it was determined in the council of Infinite Wisdom that a temple should be founded in Jerusalem, which should be erected to God, and dedicated to the service of His holy name.

After David had been gathered to his fathers, and the last honors paid to his memory, Solomon, having ascended the throne, wielded the scepter of Israel, and peace and harmony reigned throughout her borders. Then King Solomon made prepara - tion for his great work—the building of the house of the Lord; and desiring to avail himself of the well-known skill of the Tynian builders, he sent to Hiram, King of Tyre, saying: “As thou didst deal with David, my father, even so deal with me.” And King Hiram answered, saying: “I will send thee a cunning man, endued with understanding, the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, a man skillful to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, and in timber; in purple, blue, fine linen, and in crimson. Also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him. And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in. floats by sea to Joppa, and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.” And there was peace between Solo - mon, King of Israel, and Hiram, King of Tyre, for they made a league to - gether. The magnificent structure, Solo - mon’s Temple, was founded in the fourth year of his reign, on the second day of the month Zif, the second month of the sacred year.

There are in this degree two classes of emblems, the first of which consists of the Three Steps, the Pot of Incense, the Beehive, the Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s Sword, the Sword pointing to a Naked Heart, the All-Seeing Eye, the Anchor and Ark, the Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid, the Hourglass, and the Scythe. They are thus explained: The Three Steps are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, youth, manhood and age. In yiuth, as Entered Appren - tices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in manhood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor and our - selves; so that in age, as Master Ma - sons, we may enjoy the happy reflec - tioii consequent upon a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious im - mortality. The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity. As this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"178 179 with gratitude to the great and bene - ficent author of our existence, for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. The Beehive is an emblem of industry, and recom - mends the practice of that virtue to all created beings. From its busy inmates man may profitably take an example of thrift and providence. Man was formed for active and social life; and he who will not en - deavor to add to the common stock of knowledge may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of the care and protection of Masons. The Book of Constitutions, Guarded by the Tyler’s Sword, reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guardedin our words and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry; ever bearing in reinembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and circumspection. The Sword, Pointing to a Naked Heart, demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and that al - though our thoughts, words and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that All-Seeing Eye whom the Sun, Moon and Stars obey, and under whose watchful care even Comets perform their stupendous revolutions, penetrates the inmost re - cesses of the human Heart, and will judge us according to our merits. The Anchor and the Ark are emblems of a well-grounded hope and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that divine Ark which shall safely bear us over"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"180 181 life’s tempestuous sea of troubles, and of that Anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary shall find rest. The Forty-Seventh Problem of Euclid is a geometrical theorem attributed to Pythagoras, an eminent Greek philos - opher. This wise man enriched his mind by the acquisition of a knowledge of the sciences, and especially of Geometry. In this, he drew out many problems and theorems, and among the number was this, on the discovery of which, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed, “Eureka!” which signifies, I have found it. As a Masonic emblem, its contempla - tion is calculated to induce a study of Geometry and the other liberal, arts and sciences. The Hourglass is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly, the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot, without aston - ishment, behold the little particles con - tained within this glass, as almost imperceptibly they pass away, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour are all exhausted. Thus wastes man. The tender hopes of youth, the blushing honors of manhood soon vanish, and are succeeded by the withering frosts of age; and the sands of life, whether slowly or rapidly, will surely ebb away. The Scythe is an emblem of time, slender thread of life launched into eternity. Behold! what havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race! If, by chance, we escape the numerous which cuts the when we are"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"182 183 evils incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive at the years of manhood, yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all-destroying scythe of time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us.

These emblems afford subjects of serious and solemn reflection to the rational and contemplative mind; and while they admonish us that our bodies must perish and mingle with the dust, yet they remind us that our souls will survive the grave, and never, never, never die. Thus we close the explanation of the emblems upon the solemn thought of death, which, without revelation, is dark and gloomy; but the Master Ma - son is revived by the evergreen and evenliving sprig of faith in the merits of the Lion of the tribe of Judali, which inspires the bright hope that in the resurrection he will enjoy the consum - mation of perfect bliss throughout eternity.

M. CHARGE Brother—Your zeal for the Institu tion of Freemasonry, the progress you have made in its mysteries, and your conformity to its regulations, have pointed you out as a proper object of our favor and esteem. Duty and honor alike now bind you to be faithful to every trust, to support the dignity of your character on every occasion, and to recommend, by precept and example, a constant observance of the tenets of the Fraternity. Exemplary conduct on your paint will convince the wonl.d that merit is the just title to our privileges, and that on you our favors have not been undeservedly bestowed. In the character of a Master Mason you are authorized to correct the errors and irregularities of your less- informed brethren, to fortify their minds with resolution against the snares of the insidious, and to guard them against every allurement to vicious practices. To preserve unsul - lied the reputation of the Fraternity must be your constant care; and, there - fore, it becomes your province to cau - tion the inexperienced against a breach of fidelity. To your inferiors in rank or office you are to recommend obedience and submission; to your equals, cour - tesy and affability; to your superiors, kindness and condescension. Universal benevolence you are zealously to in - culcate, and by the regularity of your own conduct afford the best example for that of others less informed. The ancient landmarks of the Fraternity you are carefully to preserve, and never suffer them to be infringed, nor countenance a deviation from estab - lished customs. Your honor and reputation are con - cerned in supporting, with dignity, the character you now bear.

RECEPTION ADDRESS My Brother, we now receive you as a Master Mason, and a member of Lodge, No. ——. As such you are entitled to all the rights and privileges of the Fraternity. We trust that the influence of the ceremonies through which you have passed will encourage you in the per - foinmance of every duty here below; that you will find among your brethren unselfish friendship to aid you in every honorable pursuit; virtue to strengthen your resolution; wisdom to enlighten your mind; examples of pity and charity to excite and direct your benev - olence: that hope will brighten your thoughts and glory crown your deeds; and when your labors with us shall have ceased, that you may be raised by our Supreme Grand Master to the en - joyment of •fadeless light and immortal life, in that heavenly kingdom where faith and hope shall end, and love and joy prevail throughout eternity. 0"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"188 189 Wht dd u bhld.

Remember that you have promised to remind an erring brother of his fail- ings, to aid in his reformation, to vindi - cate his character when traduced, and to suggest, in his behalf, the most char - itable judgment. These generous principles should extend further: every human being has a claim upon your kind offices. “Do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.” Finally, brethren, be ye all of one mind; live in peace; and may the God of love and peace delight to dwell with, and Hess, you.] 00- ¼- 00- ¼- J Ostp 00- JO- 00- Jo- 9r ). 0.
