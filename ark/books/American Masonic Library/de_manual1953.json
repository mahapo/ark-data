Our ancient brethren met on the highest hills and in the lowest valleys, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eaves - droppers, and to guard against surprise. A Lodge is said, symbolically, to extend in length from east to west; in breath, from north to south; in height, from the earth to the highest heavens; in depth, from the sur - face to the center. And a Lodge is said to be of these vast dimensions to denote the uni - I ¶ versality pf Masonry, and to teach us that a Mason’s charity should be equally as extensive. A Lodge has three principal supports, which are Wisdcnn, Strength, and Beauty, because it is necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. Its covering is no less than a clouded canopy or starry-decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by the aid of that theo - logical ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw ascending from earth to heaven, the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity, and which admon - ish us to have faith in God, hope of immor - tality, and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity; for our Faith may be lost in sight; Hope ends in fruition; but Charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. The furniture of a lodge consists of a Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God; the Square, to the Master; and the Compasses, to the craft. 12 13"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Bible is dedicated to God because it is the inestimable gift of God to man; a. * a. the Square, to the Master, be - cause it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compasses, to the Craft, because, by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe their desires, and keep their passions within due bounds. The ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; and the indented tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematic of human life, checkered with good and evil; the beautiful border which surrounds it is emblematic of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the blazing star in the center. A Lodge has three symbolic lights; one of these is in the East, one in the West, and one in the South. There is no light in the North, because King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was placed 14 so far north of the ecliptic, that the sun and moon, at their meridian height, could dart no rays into the northern part thereof. The north we therefore masonically call a place of darkness. A Lodge has six jewels; three of these are immovable and three movable. The immovable jewels are the Square, Level, and Plumh. The square inculcates morality; the level, equality; and the plumb, rectitude of conduct. They are called immovable jewels because they are always to be found in the East, West and South parts of the Lodge, being worn by the officers in these respective stations. The movable jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board. The rough ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The perfect ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of the fellowcraft. The trestle board is for the master workman to draw his designs upon. 15 — ~ ““—~~,I’ ~ - ii I I I"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"By the rough ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the perfect ashlar, that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God, and by the trestle board we are also reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his trestle board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agree - ably to the rules and designs laid, down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of nature and revelation, which are our spiritual, moral, and masonic trestle board. A Lodge is situated due east and west, because, when Moses crossed the Red Sea, being pursued by Pharaoh and his host, he erected on the other side, by divine command, a tabernacle, which he placed due east and west, to receive the first rays of the rising sun, and to commemorate that mighty east wind by which their miraculous deliverance was effected. This tabernacle was an exact pattern of King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, and it is, or ought, therefore, to be placed due east and west. Our ancient brethren dedicated their lodges to King Solomon, because he was our first Most Excellent Grand Master; but modern Masons dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time, there is represented, in every regular and well governed Lodge, a certain point within a circle, embordered by two perpen - dicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist; and upon the top rests the Holy Scriptures. The point represents an individual brother; the circle is the boundary line, beyond which he is never to suffer his prejudices or passions to betray him. In going round this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within these due bounds, it is impossible that he should materially err. The three great tenets of a Mason’s pro - fession are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. By the exercise of brotherly love, we are taught to regard the 1 whole human species as one family; the high and low, the rich and poor, who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, 16 17"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"support, and protect each other. On this prin - ciple, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friend - ship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. To relieve the distressed is a duty incum - bent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misf or- tunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foun - dation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct; hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain-dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. Every Mason has * * * which are illustrated by the four cardinal virtues, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice. 4 * * * * * As entered apprentices served ‘~ * CHARGE My Brother: As you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and hon - orable Order; ancient as having subsisted from time immemorial; and honoa~able, as tending, in every particular, so to render all men, who will be comformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better prin - ciple or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. As you progress in Masonry, you will find that it is a speculative science, taught by allegory, emblems and symbols. Even the penalties of the obligation, seemingly so severe, are not to be taken literally. They are meant to convey to 1 you the mental suffer - ing that will be your punishment if you should be base enough to violate your vows. The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have 18 19"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never mentioning His name but with that revential awe which is due from a creature to his creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you. And to your - self, in avoiding all irregularity and intem - perance, which may impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your profession. A zeal - ous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the State, you are to be a quiet and peacelul subject, true to your government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but pa - tiently submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument ~vith those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may im - prove in Masonic knowledge, you are to con - verse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be ready to receive instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the order, as these are to distin - guish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly attentive not to rec - ommend him unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the [nststution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects.

SCRIPTURE Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb -line, with a plumb-line in his hand. And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, a plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them anymore.—Amos vii.7, 8. WORKING TOOLS The working tools of a Fellow Craft are the Plumb, the Square, and the Level o o o o. The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to raise perpendiculars; the Square, to square their work; and the Level, to lay horizontals; but we, as Free and Ac - cepted Masons, are taught to make us of them for more noble and glorious purposes; the plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations, before God and men, squaring our actions by the square of virtue, 22 and remembering that we are traveling upon the level of time to that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns. LECTURE The second section of this degree has reference to the origin of the Institution a * * * * * * * * *• We work in Speculative Masonry, but our ancient brethren wrought in both Operative and Speculative. By Operative Masonry we alluck to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will result a due pro - portion and a just correspondence in all its parts, and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a lund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and beneficient purposes. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintaj~s secrecy and practice charity.

To these the Romans have added two; the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamen~tal, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only acci - dently; the Tuscan is 4~ie Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic.

It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Mason, you are bound to discharge, or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict ad - herence to them, as your own experience must have established their value.

The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration; especially the science of geometry, which is established as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the won - derful properties of nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new character it is expected that you will conform to the prin - ciples of the Order, by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagement as a Fellow Craft, and to these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties. GRAMMAR Teaches the proper arrangements of words, according to the idiom or dialect of any par - ticular people; and that excellency of pronun - ciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeably to reason and correct usage. RHETORIC Teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with propriety alone, but with all the advantage of force and elegance, wisely contriving to captivate the hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expressions, whether it be to entreat or exhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC Teaches us to guide our reason discretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce, and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted, or granted; and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning, and disposing, all of which are naturally led on from an gradation to another, till the point in question is finally dctermined. This science ought to’ be cultivated as the foundation, or ground-work, of our inquiries; particularly in the pursuit of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons. 31 30"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"- ~ — 111,1111 ,IEE~EIIIIIIIII~~~I.III I I —~ ARITHMETIC Teaches the powers and properties of num - bers, which are variously affected by letters, tables, figures, and instruments.

A point is a dimensionless figure, or an indivisible part of a space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. 32 I 4 4 A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth, and thickness.

The Trowel is an instrument made us of by Operative Masons to spread the cement which unites a building into one common mass; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of spreading the cement of brotherly love and affection; that cement which unites us into one sacred band, or society of friends and brothers, among whom no con - tention should e’ver exist, but that noble con - tention, or rather emulation, of who can best work and best agree. PRAYER Thou, 0 God! knowest our down-sitting and our up-rising, and understandest our thoughts afar off. Shield and defend us from the e’~ il intentions of our enemies, and support us under the trials and afflictions we are des - tined to endure, while traveling through this vale of tears. Man, that is born of a woman, 36 is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; turn from him that he may rest, till he shall accomplish his day. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not up, till the heavens shall be no more. Yet, 0 Lord! ave compassion on the children of thy crea - ion, administer them comfort in time of bI troue, and save them with an everlasting salvation. Amen. So mote it be. LECTURE THIRD SECTION The first class of emblems are The second class of emblems are the Three Steps, the Pot of Incense, the Bee-Hive, the Book of Constitution, Guarded by the Tiler’s Sword, the Sword Pointing to a Naked Heart, 37"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the All-seeing Eye, the Anchor and Ark, the Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid, the Hour - Glass and the Scythe, and are thus explained. The Three Steps, usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet, are emblematic of the three principal stages of human life: Youth, Man - hood and Age. In Youth, as Entered Appren - tices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respec - tive duties to God, our Neighbor, and our - selves; so that in Age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflections consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great beneficent Author of our existence, for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. The Bee-Hive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us, that as we came into the world 38 r rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around ‘us are in want, when it is in our power to rclieve them without inconvenience to our - selves. The Book of Constitutions, Guarded by the Tiler’s Sword, reminds us that we should be cver watchful and guarded in our words and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry; ever bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, Silence and Circusn - spection. The Sword Pointing to a Naked Heart dem - onstrates that justice will sooner or later over - take us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of men, yet that All Seeing Eye, whom the Sun, Moon, and Stars obey, and under whose watch - ful care even Comets perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. The Anchor and Ark are emblems of a well- grounded hope and a wel’l-spent life. They are emblematic of that divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that Anchor which shall safely moor us 39"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. The Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid. This was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of priesthood, and raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abund - antly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most distinguished he erected this, when, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed, Eureka, in the Grecian Language signifying “1 have found it,” and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It’ teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. The Hour-Glass is an emblem of human life. Behold’ how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot without astonishment behold the little particles which are contained in this machine; how they pass away almost imper - ceptibly! and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man! Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost, which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. The Scythe is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold! what havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race! If by chance we should escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive at the years of man - hood; yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all-devourng scythe of Time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us.
