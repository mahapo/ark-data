It was the result of the need ex - pressed by many grand commanderies, for a uniform system of drill, in consonance with our uniform ritual; also to af - ford an authoritative method for the organization of Grand Encampment and Grand Coanmandery formations; and f in- ally to allay the constantly recurring uncertainty and friction arising in our triennial competitive drills, by reason ol many different systems of tactics. While claiming very little originality, your committee 1’~ has carefully studied the drill tactics of every grand juris - diction, as well as the tactics and drill regulations of the United States Army from 1865, and have included in this compilation that which seems most applicable to the pur - poses, circumstances and traditions of Templary. Harmony with our Ritual, and an intelligent co-ordination of the move - ments and nomenclature of the army drill, with the terms used by Knights Templar, has been our constant aim. Realizing that Templar drill is never a preparation for war, the older form of Upton’s close order drill, has been preferred to the more modern U.

However, the infantry drill regulations has been taken as the model in form and arrangement, and wherever possible its exact language and movement has been followed, Acknowledgment is also made for many ideas and sug - gestions, gathered from various sources, and especially from the following books of tactics: Manual of Knights Templar Ceremonies of the Grand Encampment. Knights Templar Drill Regulations, California. Templar Drill Regulations, Indiana. Iowa Knights Templar Tactics. Manual for Tactics and Drill, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Michigan Knights Templar Tactics. Templar Tactics, Missouri. Templar Dri[1 and Tactics, New York. Templar Tactics arl(l Drill, Pennsylvania. Knights Templar Drill Regulations, Texas. Tern p hr Tactics and Manual, Chilcott of A~aine. Knights Ternplar Tactics, South Dakota. Knights Templar Tactics, Purinton. Manual and Tactics, Grant. Tactics and Monitor, Sumner. Infantry Drill Regulations, U. S. A. Besides affording the fundamentals of dose order drill, an attempt has been made to incorporate the necessary fea - tures of display and ceremony, characteristic of Templary; also while the text is written for the average small corn - mandery, careftil provision has been made for its easy adap - tation to larger bodies and commancleries and to the Cotma - tIm-is and ceremonies of grand commanderfes; and while not containing movements exclusively used in the asylum cere - monies, frequent reference has been made thereto, and care taken, to avoid conflict therewith. This preliminary report is submitted to every grand jurisdiction for trial and critfeism, with the promise that suggestions for improve¶ment, from any source, will be grate - fully and carefully considered, and with the hope that the DEFINITIONS 9 final report which will be made at Seattle in 1925, may merit the approval of the grand encampment. After the approval of the text it is the intention to illus - trate the book with the usual plates and photographic cuts.

A careful preliminary study of general principles should always be made by officers and junior officers, betore attempting drill or instruction. The Eminent Commander is the commanding officer and is responsible for the moper training of the comuxandery. 2. It is not expected, however, that the Eminent Com - mander will actually be in command of every activity of the commandery at all times. If he does not wish to assume the command, he will direct the Generalissimo, Captain General, or other competent Sir Knight, to act as the military officer, under the title of “Commander,” the subordinate in such case to remember that he is always under the command and lirec - tion oF the Eminent Commander. In accordance with teinpiar tradition and custom, this officer will often, perhaps gener - ally, be the Captain General. In large commanderies there is no objection to the appointment also of an Adjutant or Executive Officer, “Chief of Staff.” These appointments are generally permanent, but may be emergent, and are always at the pleasure and discretion of the Eminent Commander.” 3. Drills executed at attention and the ceremonies are designed to teach precise and knightly movement, and to in - culcate that prompt obedience which is essential to proper knightly control. To this end, smartness and precision should be exacted in the execution of every detail. Such drills should be frequent, but short. 4. The formations, movements, honors and ceremonies of these drill regulations are made to conform to the infantry drill of the United States army, of present and earlier stan - dard, as nearly as possible, consistent with the purpose, tradition, uniform and arms of Templary. 5. To harmonize Knights Templar official titles with military terms, the following rules will be observed; it oeing understood, that for drill and instruction, the commanding officer may always make substitute appointments, required for efficiency, which appointments shall not affect the tem - plar rank of any officer. 13 y"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"• —— — —— — — —— nsa— s——— •—~ — -rrar— —. • — •1 I xx siichtingargus.nI xx .stichtingargus.nl V stichtingargus.nl xx .stichtingargus.nl xx .stichtingargus.nl xx >tichtingargus.nl XX .stichtingargus.nl xx ~tichtingargus.n1 xx >nchtingargus.nl xx sliCIllIflgargUS.fll xx ~lKhlIngarguS.fl1 xx ilk liiingargus.nl I ~ lit ngargus.nI xx >flLl2llflgargus.nl xx wchungargus.nl xx slit hiingargus.nl I ~i gus ni I ‘ tisril C - igargusni ngargus.nl n~~argusn1 ‘ii rigargusni btingargus.nl xx slJungargus.nl \\x —4’.. hitutiargusni xx -uichiingargus.nl xx ~t1Lhllngargus.fl1 xx ~t1chllngargus.n1 XX ntichtingargus.nl xx slichlingargus.nl xx siiclitingargus.nl xx -.liclMingargus.nl xx -uu. hiingargus.nl xx sllchtlngarguS.nl xx sliclMingargus.nl xx stichiingargus.nl xx ‘.iichtingargus.nl xx sticlllingargus.nl xx stichtingargus.nl xx -.tich~ingargus.nI <argus ni 14 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 6. The Eminent Commander, referred to as “Com - mander,” will command, and the Generalissimo and Captain General will be second and third in command. When, there - fore, the commandery is formed as a single unit (company) they will simulate respectively the positions of captain, first lieutenant and second lieutenant (officers), the remaining of - ficers of the commandery, classified as junior officers (non - commissioned oFficers), in order of rank, will correspond to the sergeants of a military company. 7. When the Commandery is formed as a battalion the constructive rank -of the Commander will be that of major; if as a regiment, that of colonel, with corresponding increase in the rank of his subordinates. 8. Grand Encampment and Grand Commandery officers will respectively simulate the grades above commandery of - ficers, as indicated in the U. S. tables of organization, for the battalion, regiment or higher unit. The duties of officers and staffs will conform as nearly as may be with the same tables. The title of the commanding officer of a Templar brigade shall be “Brigade Commander”; and of larger bodies “Grand Marshal” instead of “General”. 9. While in these regulations Templar rather than mili - tary terms are used,. no objection is seen to the employment of military titles for drill officers, especially of the higher units, as is now the practice in some jurisdictions, providing such course shall be approved by the grand commandery. Since we have so Few mounted commanderies, at present none active, no provision has been made for such drill, those interested being referred to the U. S. cavalry drill regulations. 10. The ranking officer of the Commandery, Grand Commandery or Grand Encampment may detail or relieve act - ing officers or junior officers, and form or discharge any re - quired staff, whenever he deems it expedient or necessary, for drill formations, but the assumption of military authority by such officers shall not confer or deny Templar rank. Past Commanders are designated as officers. Guides of threes or sections (corporals) are usually designated from the number of well drilled Knights. Acting junior officers may be simi - larly designated. LI I, GENERAL RULES FOR DRILLS AND FORMATIONS 11. Formations are based upon a Front of three Knights as a unit. All movements are described for single rank, but unless otherwise specified, the same orders and movements may be applied to double rank, at the option of the commanding officer, by such commands and means as he may devise. NOTE—Double rank for templar formations is discour - aged for the following reasons: By tradition Knights Tem - plars were always mounted, and cavalry or dragoons are never formed in double rank, mounted or on foot; with the close elbow touch prescribed by these regulations, the dis - tance—ten inches— between the front and rear rank, would practically prevent the execution of the sword manual by the rear rank; the drifting sidewise movement of the rear rank necessary in the wheelings, is awkward and unsightly, and the formation is wholly unsuited to the asylum ceremonies. If space is limited it is always preferable to form subdivisions separately, and close in mass, as the need for congestion may require. See Formation of the Commandery, Par. 189. 12. When the preparatory command consists of more than one part, its elements are arranged as follows: (1) For movements to be executed successively by the subdivisions or elements of a command: (a) Description of the movements; (b) how erecuted, or on what element executed. (2) For movements to be executed simultaneously by the subdivisions of a command: (a) the designation of the subdivisions; (b) the movement to be executed. 13. Movements that may be executed toward either flank are explained as toward but one flank, it being neces - sary to substitute the word “left” for “right,” and to reverse, s to have the explanation of the corresponding movement 7 toward the other flank. The commands are given For thq~ 15"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"xx >tichlingargus.nl xx >ticlitingargus.nl xx ~uchtingargus.nl XX ~tichiingargus.nl xx ~tichtingargus.n1 xx NliChlingargus.nl XX 5tichtingargus.nl Xx dichtingarguS.fll \\\\ >llLhlIflgarguS.nl xx ~li01lIflgarguS.fl1 slit bungargusni I k I’ngargus.nl I i itzargus.nl -~ - ingargusni sl1UInaarguS.nl I) in aargus.nI II’,! gtiS ni v nuu’n1 ~ar gusni :arxzusnl trgu’ ill targusni I igg~u usni t 1 ugargusni ~~Izargus.n1 It ‘iigargus.nl >tI~b ngargus.nl sit cM ;ngargus .nl ~iichtingargus.n1 >1 zchiingargus.nl —I chlingargus.fll >1 lk’hllngargus.nl silt hllllgargus.fll silk hit ngargus.nl 16 FORMATIONS AND DRILLS execution of movements toward either flank. The substitute word of the command is placed within parentheses. 14. Any movement may be executed either from the halt or when marching, unless otherwise prescribed. If at a halt, the command for movements involving marching need not be prefaced by FORWARD, as 1. Column right (left), 2. MARCH. 15. Any movement not specially excepted may be ese - cuted in double time. If at a halt, or if marching in quick time, the command Double Time precedes the command of execution. 16. In successive movements executed in double time the leading or base unit marches in quick time when not otherwise prescribed; the other units march in double time to their places in the formation ordered and then conform to the gait of the leading or base unit. If marching in double time, the command Double Time is omitted. The leading or base unit marches in quick time; the other units continue at double time to their places in the formation ordered and then conForm to the gait of the lead - ing or base unit. 17. To hasten the execution of a movement begun in quick time, the command: 1. Double time, 2. MARCH, is given. The leading or base unit continues to march in quick time, or remains at halt if already halted; the other units complete the execution of the movement in double time and then conform to the gait of the leading or base unit. - 18. To stay the execution of a movement when march - ing, for the correction of errors, the command: 1. In place, 2. HALT, is given. All halt and stand fast, without changing the position. To resume the movement the command: I. Resume, 2. MARCH, is given. 19. To revoke a preparatory command, or, being at a halt, to begin anew a movement improperly begun, the com - mand AS YOU WERE, is given, at which the movement c6ases and the former position is resumed. 20. Unless otherwise announced, the guide of a platoon GENERAL RULES 17 or larger subdivision of a commandery, or of a commandery in line, is right; of a commandery in line of subdivisions, center; of a rank in column of threes or sections, toward the side of the guide of the commandery. To march with guide other than as prescribed above, or to change the guide: Guide right (left or center). In successive formations into line, the guide is toward the point of rest; in platoons or larger subdivisions it is so announced. The announcement of the guide, when given in connec - tion with a movement, follows the command of execution for that movement; as, 1. Forward, 2. MARCH, 3. Guide right (left). 21. The wheel on the fixed pivot by subdivisions is used in all formations from line into column and the reverse. The wheel on the moving pivot is used by subdivisions of a column in executing changes of direction. The moving pivot will describe a circid the radius of which is 30 inches; the step of about nine inches required in column of threes will be reduced proportionately as the front of the subdivision is increased, the radius being always the same. 22. Partial changes of direction may be executed: by interpolating in the preparatory command the word half as column half right (left) or right (left) half turn, a change of 45 degrees is executed. By the command: Incline to the right (I~ft) the guide, or guiding element, moves in the indicated direction and the remainder of the command conforms. This movement effects slight changes of direction. In changing direction the leading subdivision executes the turn, or wheel, at the command MARCH, the guide tak - ing his position when the change is made. 2S~ Full distance in column of subdivisions is such that 7 in forming line to the right or left the subdivisions -will have ,/ their proper intervals. / In column of subdivisions the guide of the leading suk - division is charged with the step and direction; the guides 1 in N rear preserve the trace, step and distance. / / >1 Ic h~ nga rgus .nl xx stichiingargus.nl xx slichllngargus.nI xx slichiingargus.nl xx sEt hiin~argus.nl xx ~ in ~uari.zus.n1 ‘ ~pts ni xx 1k xx ‘1 xx xx xx xx xx Xx xx"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"I — —— —— ~~aIminuaflp.wmmme,a.a ——--~ —--—-—-—r-g —— — ‘—~ — — — -; ugargus.nl lEngargusni 18 k -, nugargusni 1lngargus.nl xx —Ii.. luingargus.nl ‘\\ ~u. ht~ngargus.n1 \\Y ~1I, t:ringargus.nl -, ‘ugargus ni ugargus.nl blarkuls ni t - .1Q~Lrgus.n1 2drLius.nl ‘ixirgus ni ~artius ni ~argUs.fll xirtius ni 11111’. i-il I ILL” i-fl :u’- ul U 211” Pt ~“ H ~is ul 12L1> uus.nl FORMATIONS AND DRILLS 24. All details, detachments, and other bodies of [(nights are habitually formed in single rank. 25. The designation line of sections, line of platoons, companies, etc., refer to the formations in which sections, platoons, companies, etc., each in column are in line. 26. The posts of officers, junior officers, color guard, staff, etc., in the various formations, of the platoon, com - mandery, battalion or regiment, will be described and shown in plates. In all changes from one formation to another involving a change of post on the part of any of these, unless otherwise specified, posts are promptly taken by the most convenient route as soon as practicable after the command of execution for the movement; officers who have prescribed duties in connection with the movement ordered, take their new posts when such duties are completed. 27. As instructors, officers and junior officers go wherever their presence is necessary. As file closers it is their duty to rectif V mistakes and insure steadiness and promptness in the ranks. In ceremonies officers, junior offi - cers and special units must take their prescribed positions. 28. Brigade, regimental, battalion and staff officers may be mounted. The staff of an officer Forms in single iank three paces in rear of him, the right of the rank ex - tending one pace to the right of a point directly in rear of him. Members of the staff are arranged in order of rank from right to left; the staffs in the same order according to the rank of their respective commanders. The orderlies, if present, are three paces in rear of the staff. When necessary to reduce the front of the staff and orderlies, each line exe - cutes threes right, according to the principles of the U. S. cavalry drill regulations, and follows the Commander. 29. A junior, mounted, addressing a superior officer on foot,- will first dismount. Members of the staff, and orderlies, mount and dismount with their chief. 30. In making the about, an officer, mounted, habit - iially turns to the left. ..arcus.nl .ijrtius ni - ir&xrgusnl igargus.nl -u ~tngargus.n1 A j agargusni ugargusni II PL’argus.fll GENERAL RULES 19 31. When the Commander faces to give commands, the staff and orderlies do not change position. 32. When making or receiving official reports all offi - cers will salute. Where the word “Sir” is used by an officer in making a report, as “Sir, the parade is formed,” the proper honorary title of the officer to whom reporting, will be prefixed, as “Eminent Sir,” “Right Eminent Sir,” etc. Knightly courtesy requires the junior to salute first, but when the salute is introductory to a report made at a cere - mony or formation, to the representative of a common super - ior, as the adjutant, or other staff of Ficer, etc., the officer making the report, whatever his rank, will salute first; the officer to whom the report is made xvill acknowledge by sa - luting that he has received and understood the report. 33. For ceremonies, such regimental and battalion jun - ior officers as are dismounted, are formed five paces in rear of the color or standard, in order of rank from right to left. In column of threes or sections they march as file closers. Other than for ceremonies, staff junior officers, and orderlies accompany their immediate chiefs unless otherwise directed. If mounted, the junior officers are ordinarily posted on the right or at the head of the orderlies. In all formations and movements a junior officer com - manding a platoon carries his sword and takes the same post as an officer in like situation. ORDERS, COMMANDS, AND SIGNALS 34. Officers and Knights fix their attention at the first word of command, the first note of the bugle, or the first motion of the signal. A signal includes both the preparatory command and the command of execution; the movement com - mences as soon as the signal is understood, unless prescribed, otherwise; 35. Commanders or leaders of subdivisions repeat or4 ders, commands, or signals whenever such repetition - deemed necessary to insure prompt and correct execution. 1 ilgurgusni 1 k ‘ I ‘uwraus.nl \\ JI1(rarl4usnl -. iigirgus.nl nrgus.nl ~irtius.n1 2 “2PS iii N I 7/"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"— .—. —— — — .~ — ——U- — —•— I——.

Prescribed signals are limited to such as are essen - tial as a substitute for the voice under conditions which iender the voice inadequate. 37. In these regulations an order embraces instructions or directions given orally or in writing in terms suited to the particular occasion and not prescribed herein. Orders are employed only when the commands pre - scribed herein do not sufficiently indicate the will of the Commander. 38. In these regulations a command is the will of the Commander expressed in the phraseology prescribed herein. 39. There are two kinds of commands. The PREPARATORY command, such as Forward, indi - cates the movement that is to be executed. The command of EXECUTION, such as MARCH, HALT, or SWORDS, causes the execution. Preparatory commands are distinguished by small black letters, those of execution by BLACK CAPITALS. Where it is not mentioned in the text who gives the commands prescribed, they are to be given by the Command - er of the unit concerned. The preparatory command should be given at such an interval of time before the command of execution as to ad - mit of being properly understood; the command of execution should be given it the instant the movement is to commence. The tone of command is animated, distinct, and of’ loud - ness proportioned to the number of men for whom it is in - tended. Each preparatory command is enunciated distinctly, with a rising inflection at the end, and in such manner that the command of execution may be more energetic. The command of e aecution is firm in tone and brief. 40. When giving commands to Knights, it is usually best to face toward them. Indifference in giving commands must be avoided, as it leads to laxity in execution. Commands should be given with spirit at all times. To secure uniformity, all officers should practice giving commands. IL its iii — LI-’ iii .‘tj~. p1 I) -‘ ‘Ii -‘Mi — t ,..L1’.

An officer should always have his sword drawn when giving a command. Bugle Signals 42. Bugle Signals are only used for ceremonies, and with large bodies for street parades and marches. (See Bugle Signals and Calls, Par. 461.) Whistle Signals 43. Attention to Orders. A short blast of the whistle. This signal is used on parades and marches when necessary to fix the attention of troops, or of their Commanders, or leaders, preparatory to giving commands, orders or signals. Arm Signals 44. The following arm signals are prescribed. In mak - ing signals either arm may be used. In making arm signals, the sword may be held in the hand. Forward, MARCH; Right oblique, MARCH; Left Oblique, MARCH. Extend the arm vertically to its full extent and lower it to the front (right front, left front) until horizon - tal; at the same time move in the indicated direction. Quick time, MARCH. Raise the right elbow to a posi - tion above and to the right of the right shoulder; extend the forearm to the left, right hand above the head. HALT. Carry the hand to the shoulder; thrust the hand upward and hold the arm vertically. Double time, MARCH. Carry the hand to the shoulder; rapidly thrust the hand upward the full extent of the arm several times. Change direction or Column right (left), MARCH. The)’ hand on the side toward which the change of direction is to be made is carried across the body to the opposite shouldej~, forearm horizontal; then swing in a horizontal plane, ar~ extended, pointing in the new direction. / t1uari~us,n1 rigirgusril xirlzusnl ~ argus ml - J”2uS ni"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"— —. — — — —— .q.~. ..a&~UiW~r ——a——a .n~ — — — —— — p a rLgargus.nl - ‘ingargusni iuitargus.n] - ingargus ni SCHOOL OF THE KNIGHT AND SQUAD THE KNIGHT -, B H inliargus.nl - I ngargtls ni ngargus ni t :cLigu~ ni ~LVQUs ni w.lrt2u’.Pl .aLQLI’. ni 2aL’gi.L s. ni irtzu’. nI ii its ul I .iI-’ ni 211-’ ni UN I 45. Provision should be made for the proper instruction of newly created Knights in essentials of facings, marching, wheeling and sword manual to prevent their falling into awkward or bad habits, as well as to give grace and ease of movement. To this end the following exercises are prepared: Individual Drill, Without Swords 46. The drill should always commence promptly at the appointed time. Punctuality, silence in ranks, and close attention during drill must always be insisted upon. The instructor explains briefly each movement, first ex - ecuting it himself if practicable. He requires the Knights to take the proper positions unassisted and does not touch them for the purpose of correcting them, eacept when they are un - able to correct themselves. He avoids keeping them too long at the same movement, although each should be understood before passing to another. He exacts by degrees the desired precision and uniformity. Drills should be in fatigue uniform when possible and the sword manual not taught until the Knights have acqi(red some proficiency in the school of the Knight 47~ For preliminary instruction a number of Knights, usually not exceeding three or four, are formed as a squad in single rank facing to the front.

At the command dress, the Knights move up successive - ly in quick time, shortening the last step, so as to be about six inches behind the alignment which must never be passed; each Knight then executes Eyes Right, and moves on the line taking steps of two or three inches, places his right arm lightly against the left arm of the Knight on his right, so that his eyes and shoulders are in line with those of the J(nights on his right, shoulders square to the front. At the command front, given when the ranks are aligned, the Knights turn their heads and eyes smartly to the front. 75. The Knights having learned to align themselves Than by man, the instructor next aligns them by the com - mand: 1. Right (left), 2. DRESS, 3. FRONT. The base having been established, at the command dress, the entiie rank moves forward and dresses up to the line as previously explained. The instructor verifies the alignment from the right flank and orders up or back such men as may be in rear, or in advance of the line; only the men designated move. At the command front, given when the rank is aligned, each man turns his head and eyes smartly to the front. Whenever the position of the base file or files necessitates a considerable movement by the squad, such movement will be executed by marching to the front or oblique, to the flank or backwards, as the case may be, without other command. Alignments to the rear are executed on the same prin - ciples, the Knights stepping back a little beyond the line, and then dressing up, by steps of two or three inches. The com - mands are: 1.

The instructor observes, in marching in line, that the Knights touch lightly the elbow toward the side of the guide; that they open neither arm; that they yield to pressure coming from the side of the guide, and resist pressure com - ing from the opposite direction; that shortening or lengthen - ing the step, they gradually recover the alignment and touch of the elbow, if lost, and that they keep the head direct to the front, no matter on which side the guide may be. The instructor impresses upon the Knights that the alignment can only be preserved in marching, by the uniform - ity of the step, both in length and swiftness, by the touch of the elbow, and the maintenance of the shoulders square with the line of direction.

Being in march, the instructor commands: 1. Col - umn right (left); or 1. Column half right (left), 2. MARCH. At the command march, the leading file turns to the right, or half right, on a moving pivot, followed by the other files, who turn on the same ground. To Oblique 79. Being well drilled in the principles of the direct march, the squad is taught to march obliquely. [Vlarching in line the instructor commands 1. Right (left) oblique, 2. MARCH. At the dommand march, each Knight makes a half face to the right, and then marches straight in the new direction. See Par. 71. The Knights no longer touch elbows, but preserve the line of the rank parallel to its former posi - tion by the eye only, glancing along the shoulders of the near - est files, toward the side to which they are obliquing, and regulating their steps so that the shoulders are about six inches behind the shoulders of the Knights on that side, and that the heads conceal the heads of the other Knights in the iank. The Knights preserve the same length of step, and the same degree of obliquity. To resume the original direction, the instructor com - mands: I. Forward, 2. MARCH. At the command march, each Knight makes a half face to the left in marching, and then moves straight to the front. If the squad be at a halt, the Knights half face to the right, at the command right oblique, and step off at the command march. Wheelings 80. Wheelings are of two kinds; on either fixed or moving pivot. The fixed pivot is used in wheeling from line into col - umn, or from column into line, the pivot Knight marking time in his place and turning to con form to the marching flank. The moving pivot is used in changing direction of col - umn, and in some successive formations, the pivot Knight describing a circle the radius of which is always 30 inches.

Tn circle, 2. Left (right) wheel, 3. MARCH. The Knight on the extreme right takes the full step and looks toward the pivot. All keep touch of elbows toward the pivot, head and eyes turned (eyes right) toward the marching flank, regulating the length of step accordingly. Thus continue until halted. 82. A wheel on a moving pivot, used in changing direc - tion in marching, is made in the same manner, except that the pivot Knight takes a short step thus gaining ground forward, describing the circle of 30 inches, regulating the length of his step to correspond with the marching flank. NOTE—To wheel the commandery or platoon, see Par. 193. MANUAL OF THE SWORD 83. Newly created Knights should at once be taught marching, drill and sword manual. Ease and grace can only be acquired by frequent exercise. Attention to minor details is essential in order to avoid the forming of awkwzrd habits or taking incorrect positions. Carry the sword with a flexible wrist and without grasping the gripe tightly. The gripe should be held, at position of carry, by the thumb and forefinger, as if holding a pen, and covering about two- thirds of the gripe below the guard. Each command is di - vided into motions of one-half of a second, which should, at first, be explained and executed separately without reference to cadence. On the march the cadence corresponds with the step. The manual may first be taught by calling the num - bers of motions, No. ONE being executed at the command swords, or other command of execution, then, TWO, THREE, etc.’ When on a march if the swords are drawn and not at a carry, the Knights will, at the command halt, come to Carry Swords, without command. If in scabbard the left hand steadies same. While marching, the hands may be allowed to swing forward and back three or four inches for the sake of ease and grace of carriage.

If hooked up the scabbard must be unhooked betore executing draw or return swords. 84. The sword consists of the hilt and the blade. The hilt is divided into the gripe and the guard. The gripe is the handle grasped by the hand. The guard is the cross piece between the gripe and the blade. The blade is divided into the edge, back, sides and point. The edge and back are determined by the hilt. The right and left sides of the blade and gripe are the right and left sides in the position of carry swords. The scabbard is the receptacle of the sword; the opening of same, its mouth. The hand is in tierce, when it holds the gripe, with back of hand up, and in quarte, when it holds the gripe with back of hand down. Unless the comniandery is formed in open ranks, the Knights under instruction should take intervals. 85. Being in line at a halt with swords in scabbards: 1. Sir Knights, 2. Draw, 3. SWORDS. 1. At the command draw, grasp the scabbard with the left hand, near its mouth, incline the hilt a little forward, seize the gripe with the right hand, and draw the blade until the right forearm is horizontal, back of hand against the breast. SWORDS, draw the sword quickly, raising the arm to its full length, at an angle of about 45 degrees, the sword in a straight line with the arm, edge down, extending in the same direction as the right foot. (TWO) Bring the back of the blade against the shoulder, the blade vertical, back of the gripe to the rear, the arm nearly straight down, the thumb and forefinger embracing the gripe, the thumb against the thigh, the other fingers extended and joined in the rear of the gripe. This is the position of Carry Swords. From this position all movements of the sword manual begin, unless otherwise provided. In all marching movements, except route march, at the command halt, unless otherwise provided, the sword, if drawn, will be brought to the carry without command.

The importance and responsibility oF the officer in all Templar and military formations can not be over-em - phasized. He should be a model of promptness, dress, effi - ciency and appearance, should be devoted, enthusiastic and untiring, and to succeed must be a student and a gentleman. Discipline and courtesy are as essential among Templars as with military men and must be maintained, yet the leader should not forget that his men are gentlemen, who out of ranks, are his peers. 138. Officers are described as those above and includ - ing the rank of Captain General, and Past Commanders; those under that rank are classed as junior officers, the dis - tinction being made to obtain the necessary parity with mil - itary formations and terms. However, in Templary no dif - fetance in class is recognized, excepting in the measure of responsibility, templar rank usually being but temporary, and resulting often only from an accident of age or tenure. 139. The recommendation for systematic training in a school for officers and junior ofFicers is here renewed. The requirements should be regular attendance, strict discipline, and prompt commencement and dismissal. After the oral lesson the squad should be thoroughly drilled in each move - ment. There should be the keenest attention and no talking in ranks. No faulty movement should ever be overlooked- The officers should alternate as instructors, and all should be practiced in giving commands. If the Commander is not in charge he should appoint a chief instructor, preferably on permanent detail. 140. All commands to Templars under arms, meaning equipped with sword and accoutrements, are given with sword drawn. 141. Unless otherwise directed, officers omit the man - ual except the carry and order, parade rest, rest-on-swords, 44 ~tinusnl ILi.jrnUSfll li2argus nl 29 iigargusnl >... ?tngargus.nl —i SCHOOL OF THE OFFICER 45 and kneelings; in rendering honors they execute the present, the un-cover and re-cover; they draw and return without command. 142. Officers may be in “formation” but are never in ranks,” unless temporarily so absorbed, when they will drill and present like other Knights. Whether in the station of officer, junior officer, or Knight, by appointment or other - wise, a Knight Templar will always conform with the honors and courtesies relating to that grade. 143. Officers salute, by the officers present, or salute swords. Officers or junior officers, commanding companies, pla - toons, a division or an escort, will use the salute swords; at the command present, they will execute the present, and at swords will take the position of salute swords. Officers in ranks taking the place of Knights, and all other Junior officers, execute the present swords prescribed for Knights. - 144. In double time, officers bring the sword across the body at an angle of fort”’-five degrees, edge out and about six inches in front of thu breast, right hand forward, fore - arm horizontal, blade crossing opposite the left shoulder, left hand steadying the scabbard (if not hooked up), right arm swinging easily. 145. When the Captain General, Adjutant, or other of - ficer in the Asylum or before the commandery, publishes or - ders, he will return his sword before reading the orders, then draw and come to the carry. 146. On drill or march the commanding officer goes wherever his presence is necessary but in ceremonies every officer, junior officer and Knigh? must take the position and post prescribed. &Inngargus.nl xil;ngargus.nl vt~.. inngargus.nl ‘‘ “tI..tlIflgargUSfll XX -iiJ~1ingargtis.nI Xx ‘-~tt~h~irig3rgtis.nI ‘tixht’ngargus.nI xX ~ I itiurgus nl xX ~ . h.{LirgUS.nI ni ii> - n I - ‘1 -‘ 4 xx A XX XX IX"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"‘ ~- iv ~i ~ngargus.nI XX ~ blingargusni Xx —n. tingargusmi ‘\\ ‘4. hltngargus.nl FORMATION FOR PUBL[C PARADE XX SIb. hungargus.nl XX stb. htingargus.nl xx ~lRhlingarguS.fl1 xx u’Jt~ngargus.rP 2 - t 4n~argusal -, niariius.n~ ‘tmiargus.nl ‘2cLrgus.fll - n-ar~u> - - ‘uari.ius nI ‘A nuargu~nI With Standard Guard, Eminent Commander’s Staff, and Band 147.

In these regulations, while no requirement is made for the Standard Guard in commandery drill, the Colors should always be carried in public parade. See Par. 153. 152. This formation may include several commanderies, when, if desired, the colors of all may be grouped, under the direction of the Grand Sword Bearer, or the Senior Sword Bearer, and will take the same relative position as provided for the colors of a commandery; the formation of the colors may be in line or column, and in order of the rank of the res - pective commanderies. The Standard Guard 153x The Grand Standard is not a parade banner and is recommended never to be carried in public parade. See Note, end of Par. 159. For public parade the Colors consist of a National Flag, a Beauceant, and a State Color, if present, see Par. 183. The Beauceant will salute with the commandery at all commands to present swords, and as otherwise provided. The State Color salutes in the ceremony of Escort-to-the- Color, and when saluting the Grand Master or Grand Com - mander or their official representatives, but in no other case. The National Flag never renders or ackpowledges any salute. If marching the salute is executed when six paces from the officer; the carry is resumed when six paces beyond him.

The following is published for the information of all concerned: (a) In decorating with the National Flag, never festoon or drape it. Hang it flat. Par. 460. - (b) If hung so stripes are horizontal, union should be in the left upper corner. (c) If hung perpendicularly, union should be in the right upper corner. (d) When carried in parades or crossed with other flags, the National Flag should always be on the right. (e) The National Flag should never be placed below a person sitting. The Eminent Commander and Staff 156. IF the Eminent Commander does not assume the command, he will designate an Acting Commander, Par. 2. The Eminent Commander with his staff will then form on the right of the commandery, the left element on a line and six paces to the right of the right guide. Par. 157. The staff will consist of the Prelate and any other off i - cers, junior officers, or Past Commanders, not otherwise ab - sorbed in the formation. In line, the staff will form in order of rank, the Emi - nent Commander on the right, and the Prelate, Treasurer and Recorder on the left. Past Commanders, for public parade and ceremonies, COMMANDER AND STAFF 49 take position, in order of rank, on the left or in rear of the first three officers of the commandery, unless on detail or absorbed in the lines. Par. 338, and Statutes G. E. Sec. 195. [n column, the Eminent Commander will march at the head with the next two in rank forming a triangle, each, one pace from him to the right and left and two paces retired; the other members following in column of twos, threes or sections, and conforming to the movements of the com - mandery. The Eminent Commander gives orders to his staff in a tone of voice loud enough to be heard by them only. If a large number of past officers are present, he may designate a Past Commander to direct them. The swords of the Emi - nent Commander and his staff are not drawn but carried at a secure, except at inspection or review, when if not drawn they may be hooked up. When the Eminent Commander is in command of the lines, the staff, if desired, may still be formed and maneu - vered as above described, under the direction of the senfor officer or designated Past Commander. There is, however, no objection to its members being absorbed in the command - ery formation. The Band 157. The band, if present, will take position in close order, its front rank on a line with the commandery, its left, - six paces to the rieht of the Eminent Commander, or the right guide. The Eminent Commander gives the order to move. [f a marshal has been designated, see Par. 457, he, with his staff, precedes the band; the Eminent Commander, and staff, may likewise do so at his pleasure.

Escorts of honor are detailed for the purpose of receiving and escorting commanderies and officials of high rank. The escort may consist of a commandery or of a sub - division. The Knights for this purpose should be selected for their knightly appearance and superior discipline. The escort forms in line opposite the place where the commandery is quartered. The band will be on the flank qf the escort toward which it will march. The commander of the escort will direct an officer to wait on the Commander and present his compliments, in - forming him that the escort is in readiness. The commandery, or distinguished party, marches past and in front of the escort and forms line in prolongation of line of escort, after passing the band, its flank twenty-four paces from the band of the escort. NOTE—Distances may be reduced as required by lack of numbers or space. When the head reaches flank of escort the escort will present swords and remain in that position until the rear has passed the band of the escort. The commandery in marching past the escort will be at carry swords; the Commander and officers saluting with the sword, holding in that position until rear of command passes band of escort. When the commandery has passed escort and band, the escort will come to carry swords. When the commanderM is in position, the escort will form in column of threes, or sections, and, headed by the hand, march past the commandery. The escort will be brought to carry swords in marching past, the officers saluting, as before explained. 50 ESCORTS OF HONOR 51 The commandery in line will present swords as ex - plained. When the rear of escort has passed, the commandery in line will break into column and follow at twenty-four paces distance. An officer will be detailed to accompany the command - ery escorted and assist them in the arrangements. When an officer of high rank is to be escorted an officer will be detailed to attend him. The escort will receive him with present swords, When the escort arrives at destination it will form line and halt while the commandery marches past. The same honors will be given as before explained, ex - cept that the commandery does not halt, but continues on to its quarters. If the escort is also to go to quarters with the commandery it will follow as explained. When the position of the escort is at a considerable dis - tance from the point where the commandery or official is to be received, as, for instance, where a courtyard or wharf intervenes, a double line of Knights is posted from that point to the escort, facing inward; the Knights will successively salute as the commandery or oFficial passes, and will then join the escort.

The commandery will presant swords and the Standard Guard will march into the church in column of files. Whan the Standard Guard enters the church the com - mandery will be brought to carry swords. • The Colors will form line facing the chancel at the order. The color bearer will advance and place the National Flag on the right in socket provided and stand at atteintion in front of it. The National Flag is placed at the right of the chaincel—not the right~of the color bearer. The Standard, Beauceant and State Color will in like manner be deposited, the Standard Guard standLng at attention. The commandery will return swords, enter the church at secure swords, in column of files, and un-cover, and be seated at the signal or command of the commander. The Standard Guard will be seated at the same signal. NOTE—If the attendance is large, entrance and egress should be made in two or more columns by different doors and aisles. After the services the commandery will march from the church in column of files (may be left in front), and re-form line facing the entrance. The Standard Guard will take the banners, reform column of files with the National Flag in front and march out of the church. When the National Flag appears at the entrance the- Commander will command: 1. Present, 2. SWORDS, face to the front and present sword. The Standard Guard will form in line six paces in front of the Commander, facing the commandery, the National Flag on right, and march to its post; when they have arrived in line the commandery will be brought to carry swords.

NOTE—It is permissible to carry the Grand Standard on Church Parade, or it may he demounted and set up in the church. 52 HONORS AND SALUTES 160. The composition consisting of the words and music known as the “Star Spangled Banner” is designated the National Anthem of the United States of America. At all parades and ceremonies under arms, the command - ery will render the prescribed salute and will remain in the position of salute while the National Anthem is being played. If not under arms, the commandery will be brought to attention at the first note of the National Anthem, or To The Color, and the salute reindered by the officer in command. When the National Anthem is played at any place where Sir Knights are present, all not in formation will stand at attention facing toward’ the music; if the National Flag is present they will face toward it. If in uniform or civilian clothes, covered, they will un - cover at the first note of the anthem, holding the head dress on the right shouldei~, and so remain until its close, exc~pt that in inclement we4ther the head dress may be slightly raised. If uncovered, they will salute with the hand, at the first note of the anthem, retaining the position of salute~un - til the last note. The same rules apply when To the Color is sounded as when the National Anthem is played. The National Anthem shall be played through without repetition of any part not required to be repeated to make it complete. The playing of the National Anthem as part of a med - ley is prohibited. 161. Sir Knights not in formation will on all occasions salute the National Flag when carried by a body authorized by law to carry it. When the National Flag passes a commandery or sub - division of Knights they will be brought to attention and the Commander and officers will salute. Officers, only, will salute wh[le marching in formation. The Knights will be at carry swords when marching .honors are given. 162.

In order to promote a more general read~ng of the first page of the Ritual ai~ extract is here inserted: “Officers will salute with sword or hard, according as the sword is drawn or in the scabbard. Upon addressing or being addressed, the junior will always mabe the first salute, which will be acknowledged by the senior. “If the salute is with the sword, both come to carry simultaneously and stand at attentiom or the junior may stand at salute while making a short report. “They should always exchange salutes at the close of the conversation. “The S. M. (or E. C.) if seated, does not rise to ac - knowledge a salute, arid the II. P. (or P.), in robes, salutes and acknowledges salutes by bowing ceremoniously. “An officer should always have hit sword drawn when giving a command.” 164. Under no circumstances will a Knight (other thai~ a presiding officer) attempt to salute in a sitting position. 165. The Grand Master, the Grand Commander, aAd their representatives.’ arid Past Grand Commanders, are the wily Sir Knights entitled to be received under an arch of steel. 166. Sir Knights should exchange salutes, the Knight or officer junior in rank saluting first. Officers and Knights, covered or uncovered, but not in formation, without swords or with sword fr scabbard, salute with the hand salute, holding the hand to the chapeau or cap until the salute is acknowledged or the officer passed. At no tim&—no place—or under any circumstances, is a sword drawn to acknowledge a salute already given. When in ranks Knights never uncover or salute except by command. Never salute and uncover at same time. An officer is “in formation,” but never is in rai~ks.” A Knight in ranks will not salute when directly ad - dressed but will come to atteintion if at rest or at ease. If two commanderies or subdivisions meet, their com - manders will exchange salutes, both commands being at at - tention. Whan passing in review an officer salutes, executing K HONORS AND SALUTES eyes right, and looks toward the reviewing officer when he is six paces from him; and returns to the carry and turns the head and eyes to the front when he has passed six paces beyond him. The Commander, if seated, acknowledges a salute with the hand, without rising. Officers and Knights, in replying to a question from the Commander or other superior, rise and salute. The title oi the Commander or other superior should not be given with the salute. The Prelate, when in uniform, salutes the same as other officers; if in robes, he salutes and acknowledges a salute by bowffig ceremoniously. During the opening, closing, and other ceremonies in the Asylum, and on field ceremonies, all officers taking part will draw and return sword at the proper time without command. 167. All Sir Knights not in formation passing the un - covered National Flag, or whan the National Flag passes, will render honor as follows: If in uniform arid sword drawn they will salute with the sword; if in uniform and covered, or if in civilian dress arid covered, they will uncover, holding the head dress on the right shoulder with the hand; if uncovered, they will salute with the hand salute. All hand salutes are givan with the right hand. Every National Flag in a passing Templar parade will be sajuted. No honors are paid whan on route marches. No salutes are rendered when marchffig in double time. A mounted S[r Knight dismounts before addressing an officer not mounted. A mounted officer dismounts before addressing a super - ior officer not mounted. When several officers in company are saluted, all who are entitled to the salute return it.

Outside of his own commandery, he is not entitled to the flourish. The officer commanding a battalion is saluted the same. ESCORT OF THE COLOR 169. This ceremony, while most suitable for the forma - tion of a grand commandery, may be used by a commandery, or by several commanderies in battalion or regimental forma - tion. If several commanderies are present the colors should be massed. See Public Parade, Par. 147. Selection as escort is a mark of special distinction usu - ally accorded to a company or commandery for proficiengy in drill and appearance. The commandery or larger organi - zation being in line, with space reserved for the Standard Pt I ESCORT OF THE ~COLOR 57 • Guard, the commanding officer details a platoon, company or commandery, to escort the Colors to their place in line. The escort is formed in column of platoons, or if a pla - toon, in colunrn of sections, the band in front. The escort then marches, without music, to the temporary station of the Standard Guard, which should be near the right flank of the line, and forms line, facing the Standard Guard, the band on the right, and preseints swords; the band gives the ruffle and the field music, if present, sounds to the co[or. Swords are brought to the carry, and column of pla - toons formed, the band taking post in front of the column; the Standard Guard places itself between the platoons, the escort marches with guide left, the band playing, and is so conducted that when the escort arrives at fifty paces in front of the line, the direction of the march shall be paralle[ to its front; when the Standard Guard arrives opposite its place in line, the escort is formed in line to the left; the Stan - dard Guard passingbetween the phtoons, advances and halts twelve paces in front of the commar~ding officer. NOTE—If numbers are small or space inadequate the distances specified shou~Id be proportionaLe~ reduced. The Standard Guard having halted, the commanding of - ficer, who has taken post thirty paces in front of the center of the line, faces about, commands: 1. Present, 2. SWORDS, resumes his front and salutes; the color bearers, State Color and Beauceant execute the color salute at the command present swords. The commanding officer then faces about and brings the command to carry swords; at which the Standard Guard takes its post in line; passing by the left of the commanding officer. The escort presents swords and comes to the carry with the command, after which it [s formed again in co[umn of platoons, and, preceded by the band, marches to its place in line, pass[ng around the left flank of the line. The band plays until the escort passes the left of the line, when it ceases playing and returns to its post on the right, passing in rear of the line. The command may be brought to a rest when the escort passes the left of the line."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"z7~T-_— w. stichtingargu s.nI’ w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.fll w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl -w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.st,chtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.silchtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus ni w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl DRILL CORPS AND COMPETITIONS 170. Nothing contributes more to the interest and esprit of a commandery, than a thoroughly competent and well sup - ported drill corps. Competitions increase interest and efti - ciency only when conducted according to the highest stan - dards of Knightly courtesy and true sportsmanship. The fol - lowing suggestions for adoption by commanderies and grand commanderies are made for the information and encourage - ment of all concerned. A drill corps should be formed in every commandery for training in drill and ceremonies, the inculcation of discipline, and the general improvement in the action and life of the commandery. While the drill corps must develop indepen - dence of action and initiative, it should always be under the control of the commandery. Its officers may be appointed by the Commander or by the Council, or elected by the mem - bers of the corps, but must always be selected with the greatest care, and be s4bordinate to the authority of the commandery. The Commander of the corps, who occupies the position of “Commander” in these regulations, is by far the most im - portant. If not the author, he is indeed the inspiration and builder of the corps. Every commandery should endeavor to develop a man of the requisite qualifications, and should give him every possible encouragement and support. Only results count, and when obtained, the leader should not be disturbed in his tenure nor hampered in his plans. The same may be said, only in lesser degree, of the other officers, junior officers and Knights, who are willing to per - form the necessary sacrifice and labor, and to whom should • be assigned the most effective positions, with the greatest possible permanency, and the largest measure of appreciation and support. In cities and districts having several contiguous com - manderies, the organization of permanent battalions and reg - iments should be encouraged. 58 9 COMPETITIVE DRILLS 59 Competitive Drills 171. The Schedule Plan provides for a specific schedule of movements to be placed in the hands of the Captain, by the drill committee, not more than thirty minutes prior to the appearance of his drill corps on the field; that all the required movements shall be taken from the drill regulations of the. Grand Encampment, Knights Teinplar of America; that the schedule shall be known only to the committee, and that no Captain may witness the drill of sny preceding team. NOTE—As an encouragement to entry, it is also per - missible when the schedule plan is used, to publish the same in advance, to facilitate the preparation of competitors. For Grand Commanderies this is generally recommended. 172. The Program Plan does not prescribe a list of movements, but furnishes a program showing the class and value of movements which will be judged; as “Alignments, fifteen points,” “Wheelings, fifteen points,” ‘Sword manual, ten points,” “Facings, five points,” etc., which is published with the announcement of the competition. Experience proves that by this plan it is possible for a drill corps to perfeci and memorize a schedule containing the required points, and execute the same faultlessly, without possessing either exper - ience or a high degree of proficiency or general knowledge of the drill regulations. The conclusion reached therefore, is that while the pro - gram plan may afford encouragement to beginners, the schedule plan is the only real test of all round efficiency in drill, and should be applied in all higher class contests and particularly for national competitions such as occur at the Triennial Conclaves of the Grand Encampment. Judges 173. The question frequently arises concerning the rel - ative advantage of Knights Templar or professional soldiers, as judges; the latter being frequently preferred because of their exact knowledge of drill, and because disinterested and impartial.

With these close order formations as well as with the significance and his - torical value of our commandery display movements, and our peculiar uniform and equipment, Knights Templar, many of whom have army training, are constantly familiar; cer - tainly question cannot be raised of a lack of ability, or char - acter, or sportsmanship on the part of Templars It is, therefore, recommended that Templar judges be habitually employed in all competitions of the Order. RULES FOR COMPETITIVE DRILLS Preamble: 174. The object of drill competitions is to create enthus - iasm in the Templar body and perfect Knights Templar drill, without which the Order cannot make a creditable appearance in public. It is believed the competitions of the Grand Encampment should be conducted under a plan which will fully test the proficiency of those participating, particularly the officers, who should be trained to think and act quickly, and that a specific numbered schedule given out shortly before the com - petition, will best accomplish this. The Grand Master for Triennial Conclaves and the Grand Commanders of the several states for State Conclaves, may if desired, create second and third classes with simpler schedules, or for such classes, schedules may be published in advance. The following rules are deemed effective in producing the proper results and are intended for Class One Competi - tions. These rules may be modified to suit the convenience of any grand commandery, but when adopted by the Grand Encampment for its competitive drills, they cannot be al - tered or amended except by action of that body. Rules 175. 1. Each commandery drill team shall consist of twenty-four Knights, four guides, two platoon leaders, and one commander, total thirty-one; formed in two platoons. ‘I - COMPETITIVE DRILLS 61 Each battalion team shall consist of not less than three nor more than four companies of thirty-one men each, one battalion commander, one battalion adjutant, one sergeant major, and one trumpeter.

No Commander of any team will be permitted to witness the drill of com - petitors preceding his time for drill, nor any team to hold any practice drill after the competition begins. The pm - ciple herein involved is a matter of honor and sportsmanship. ______________ C"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"~251~1~ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus . ni w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w, stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.sdchtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl w - stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl -w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl -w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI 62 COMPETITIVE DRILLS 6.

While any desired plan for judging and scoring may be adopted, the following scheme is recommended as being accurate, rapid and workable: (a) Definition of duties for judges: The first judge will observe and mark the errors of the Commander, his position, wrong commands and unnecessary commands. The second judge the platoon leaders and omissions. The third judge the Knights and guides of the first platoon. The fourth judge the Knights and guides of the second platoon. The fifth judge the cadence, length of step and time. On inspection the first judge receives honors, inspects swords, baldrics, gloves, chapeaux, faces, collars, the sword movement and general appearance. The second judge inspects coats, belts, trousers, shoes, and position of the Knight. In battalion competition the judges will assume addi - tional duties as follows: The first judge will mark all the commanders and the adjutant. The second judge, all the platoon leaders, the sergeant major and the bugler. The third judge, the guides and knights of the first two companies. The fourth judge, the guides and knights of the remain - ing companies. On inspection the first and second judges inspect the first two companies and the third and fourth judges the remaining companies of the battalion. (b) The scoring will be based on a total of 1000 points. (c) Each Commander should be furnished a summary of the score of his team, showing the markings hi detail. (d) For state competitions a lesser number of judges may be employed if desired. It will always be important that the duties of the judges be assigned in advance to admit of thorough preparation. The names of the judges should not be announced before the commencement of the competition. p COMPETITIVE DRILLS 65 (e) The schedule should be printed, preferably on both sides of a small card, in form convenient for use by Com - manders and Judges.

The Program Plan 177. If the Program Plan is adopted the same rules and procedure is applicable with the following exceptions: Since each team decides for itself the movements to be executed, all reference to “Schedule” will be omitted. This will require the elimination of rules five and six and the mod - ification of rules one, three, four and eight. The number and function of the judges need not be changed, nor the method of marking, which will be based on the following valuations: General appearance 15 points Marching 15 points 15 points Wheelings 15 points Sword Manual 10 points Facings S points Flank Movements 5 points Oblique Movements 5 points Templar Display .-.~ 15 points Total 100 points J SCHOOL OF THE COMMANDERY AND PLATOON General Rules 178. The commandery platoon or detachment is formed in single rank. Par. 189. For special occasions and formations, fours or twos may be used, but the unit of threes is enjoined by these regula - tions, and is always recommended. The Commander is responsible for the instruction of his officers and junior officers not only in the duties of their respective grades but in those of the next higher grades; but while giving them thorough instruction in the methods of training and command, he must be careful not to curtail their initiatire. The commandery will be divided into platoons usually of not less than two or more than four sections each, equal in strength unless the left platoon is smaller. Companies may be formed of not less than two platoons each, which will gen - erally be determined by the number of available officers. Within these limits the permanency of platoons and com - panies should be maintained. The formations of the commandery are: line, column of companies or platoons (at full distance or in close column), line of companies or platoons, (at full or close intervals), and column of threes or sections. At the formation of the commandery, the platoons are numbered consecutively from right to left and these designa - tions do not change. Officers and junior officers will be assigned as company and platoon leaders, and guides. A cominandery of less than four sections may be commanded by the Commander as a single platoon. 179. When numbers and space permits, the column of sections or platoons in preference to threes should always be 67"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"— —I — w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl -w .stichtingargus.nl w,stichtingargus .nl w.stiehtingargus.nl w.sdchtingargus.nl w . stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl wstichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl I w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargusnJ w . stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I 68 GENERAL RULES formed for review, both in and out of the Asylum, and for street parades and other public ceremonies, as being more dignified, impressive and characteristic. The column of sec - tions may also very properly be made the usual route forma - tion of the commandery. 180. The descriptions and plates in these regulations, in answer to the requirements of highly specialized drill, pro - vide for right and left guides of each platoon. When limited, however, by lack of numbers or skill, it is permissible for a commandery to omit interior guides or the guides entirely, employing the second and third officers alternately as guides and platoon leaders. Interior Guides may even be omitted from competitive drills, when so provided by the rules of the competition. The commandery or company in line, interior guides will be in the line of file closers, opposite the second file from the left and right of their respective platoons. The right and left guides of the flank platoons will be respectively the right and left guides of the commandery or company. 181. As instructor, the Commander goes wherever his presence is necessary. In line, his post is three paces in front of the center of the commandery; in column of files, twos, threes, and sections, by the side of the leading guide, on the flank opposite the file closers; in column of platoons or companies, three paces in front of the chief of the leading subdivision; in line of platoons or companies, in column of threes or sections, three paces in front of the leading guides and opposite the center of the interval between the leading subdivisions. At the command to dress, unless otherwise provided, the commander or platoon leader places himself in prolongation of the line, two paces from and facing the flank toward whfch the dress is made, verifies the alignment, commands front and takes his post. 182. Chiefs of platoons are posted as follows: (a) In line, in the line of file closers two paces in rear of their res - pective platoons; (b) the commandery in column of files, twos, threes, or sections, in the 1 ie qf ~il~ closers opposite 4 SCHOOL OF THE COMMANDERY 69 the center sub-division of their platoons; (c) in’ column of platoons, two paces in front of their platoons; (d) in line of platoons, by the side of the leading guide. The Standard Guard 183. In these Regulations, while no provision is made for the Standard Guard in the drill and display movements of the commandery, it may be used if desired and when present, will take position s~d maneuver as indicated in the text, or as may be determined by the commanding officer. See “Formation for Public Parade,” Par. 147. The Standard Guard is composed of the Standard Bearer, Sword Bearer, Warder, and Color Bearer, if present, any or all of whom may be replaced by temporary detail, when exig - ency requires. The Sword Bearer commands the Standard Guard, marches on its right, and does not carry a banner. When the state color is present it will be borne by an extra color bearer, who will march on the left of the Standard Bearer. NOTE.—Sance it is the duty of the Standard Bearer to “Display the banner of our Order,” and since the National Flag must always be on the right, it is suggested that a Color Searer be detailed to carry the National Flag;. In some jurisdictions the State Flag is also carried, although not authorized by the Grand Encampment nor recognized by the Ritual. When carried it should be on the left of the Standard Bearer and by an extra color bearer. The military and ceremonial functions of the Standard Guartl will be best fulfilled if the Warder does not carry a banner. The forma - tion of the Standard Guard would then be, a front of four (or five), from right to left! Sword Bearer, in command; Color Bearer with National Flag; Standard Bearer, with Beauceant or Grand Standard; Extra Color Bearer with State Color, if present; Warder. Should the Warder carry the National Flag he should march on the right of the Standard Bearer. Sir Knights bearing flags or banners may lay aside the sword, or if carried it should be in scabbard, hooked up.

When composed of not less than twenty- four files, a company of two platoons may be formed com - manded by an orficer or junior officer designated as com - pany leader. Right and left guides of the platoon should be desig - nated trom the junior officers; if no guides are present the flank files of the platoon act as guides. The alignments are executed as prescribed in the school of the squad, the guide being established instead of the flank file. When platoons are to be dressed, platoon leaders give commands and place themselves as follows: The commandery or company in line he gives the command dress and takes his post; in column of platoons he places himself two paces from and facing the flank toward which the dress is made, and after dressing his platoon, commands Front, and takes his post. Platoon leaders repeat such preparatory commands as I are to be immediately executed by their platoons, as forward, threes or sections right, etc., the Knights execute the com - mands march, halt, etc., if applying to their platoons, when given by the commander. In movements executed in route step or at ease the platoon leaders repeat the command of execution if necessary. Platoon leaders do not repeat the commander’s commands in executing the manual of the sword, nor those commands which are not essential to the execution of a movement by their platoons, as, column of threes, First platoon threes right, etc. In giving commands or cautions, platoon leaders may prefix the number of their pla - toons, as First platoon, halt; Second platoon, threes right, etc. When the formation admits of the simultaneous erecu - Lion of movements by platoons, the commander may cause such movement to be executed by prefixing, platoons to the command prescribed, as, 1. Platoons Right front into line, 2. R’IARCH. To complete such movements the commands halt or march are given by the commander. When separately formed the command front is given by the platoon leader. ~1 SCHOOL OF THE COMMANIJERY 185. The commandery, company or platoon in column of sections, threes, twos or files, forms column and reforms subdivisions as explained in the school of the squad and school of the comniandery; also executes the halt, rests, fac - ings, steps and marchings, manual of the sword, resumes attention, kneels and rises as explained in the school of the squad; and executes threes or sections right (left), threes or sections right (lefty about, route step, and at ease, and obliques and resumes the direct march as explained in the school of the squad and school of the commandery. The same rule applies to detachments, escorts, etc., substituting their designation in the commands. 186. When interior guides are not present, wheeling from line into column of platoons, the rear guide will pass to the opposite flank and follow in trace. Wheeling into line from column of platoons, he will pass so as to be in his post on completion of the wheel. In passing he moves in front of his platoon or by the shortest route, in double time. In all wheels, the guide on the marching flank keeps the pivot constantly in view; to this end, the Knight next to him keeps the line of his shoulders a little to the rear, but in the same direction. In wheeling on a fixed pivot, when the subdivisions are halted, the command halt is given when the marching flank is about three paces from the perpendicular to the original position. In wheeling on a moving pivot, the command forward is given in sufficient time, to add march the instant the wheel is completed. In all wheelings by threes or sections the forward march is taken up on the completion of the wheel unless the com - mand halt is given. In forming line from column of platoons, if the platoons are unequal, the guide should first be announced on the flank toward which the wheel is made, and the alignment of the guides effected before the command march is given. 187. In computing distances the breadth of a Knight is taken at twenty-two inches, and his depth at twelve inches; this gives ten inches from breast to back (facing distance) between ranks in column of files, between ranks in column"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus ni w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w - stichtingargus.nl w - stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus.nl w.xtichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w - stichtingargus.nl w - stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus . ni w. stichtingargus . n I 72 GENERAL RULES of twos, thirty-two inches, between ranks in columns of threes, fifty-four inches, and between ranks in column of sec - tions one hundred twenty inches. The distance of the leading guide from the leading file, and the rear guide from the rear file, in column of files, is ten inches, in column of twos, thirty-two inches, iii column of threes, fifty-four inches, and in column of sections, fifty- four inches. 188. The guides of a column of threes or sections place themselves on the flank opposite the file closers. To change the guides and file closers to the other flank: 1. File closers on left (right) flank, 2. MARCH; at the first command the file closers close to the column, and at the command march, they dart through; the commander and guides change to the other flank. In column of threes or sections each rank preserves the alignment toward the side of the guide. In marching to the front the leading guide selects points in advance, observing with greatest care the direction, and the length and cadence of the step; the Knight next to the guide takes special pains never to pass him, keeping the line of his shoulders a little in rear but in the same direction. Guides and Knights in the line of file closers, execute the sword manual during the drill, unless specially excused, when they remain at the carry. During ceremonies they ex - ecute all movements. In taking intet-vals and distances, unless otherwise di - rected, the guides at the first command, place themselves in the line of file closers. In taking intervals at the command march, the file closers face to the flank, and each steps off with the file nearest him. In assembling the guides and file closers resume their positions in line. To Form the Commandery 189. At the sounding of the assembly, the Senior War - den (or senior junior officer, right guide) facing the pro - posed line of formation, and six paces in front of the center, commands: Fall in, at which the Knights form in single rank facing to the right, graduated in size from front to rear, tall - est in front; the swords in scabbards. SCHOOL OF THE COMMA NDERY 73 The signal having ceased, he commands: 1. Left, 2. FACE, 3. Draw, 4. SWORDS. If the roll is to be called, he first brings the command - ery to support, and calls the roll. Each Knight answers “here”, and brings his sword to a carry, as his name is called. lie then commands: 1, Count, 2. THREES; at this command, all except the right file execute eyes right, and commencing at the right, the Knights count in a sharp, quick tone of voice, one, two, three, etc. Each Knight turns his head and eyes to the front as he counts. He then commands: 1. Ones, 2. COUNT. When the numbers one of each three, except the first, execute eyes right and count in the same manner, one, two, three, four, etc., from right to left, and immediately turn the head to the front. The odd threes constitute the right, and the even threes the left, of sections. Unless otherwise designated, the left guide of each sec - tion will be its Chief. Chiefs of sections ascertain the rela - tive position of their sections in line, when ones are counted. Each chief of section divides the number counted by his sec - tion by two; the quotient represents the number of his sec - tion; e. g., should his number be eleven, divided by two, the quotient five, tells him that five sections precede his own- If the Standard Guard be present, see Par. 148-183. Twos are then counted on the same principles, and, if the passion cross is to be formed, fours may be counted in the same manner. lie next divides the commandery into platoons; after which the left guide (Junior Warden) takes post on the left of the line.

If numbers permit the formation of two or more com - panies of not less than two platoons each, and it is desired, this will now be done by the Commander, who will designate the necessary leaders and guides. Companies should be sep - arately fonned preparatory Co the formation of the battalion. School of the Battalion, Par. 332. NOTE—If space be inadequate to form large comman - deries in line, platoons (divisions or companies) may be sep - arately formed, their guides respectivejy reporting to the Senior Warden (right guide), Sir, First (or such) platoon p (division or company) is formed. Such subdivisions may be formed in column of subdivisions or otherwise as convenient, and closed in mass to any required distance, thus obviating the use of the double rank, which is always awkward and unsuitable, especially for the sword manual, the wheelings and asylum ceremonies. Par. 11. 190. Being in line at a halt, the Commander directs the Senior Warden to dismiss the commandery. The officers fall out, and the Senior Warden salutes, steps three paces to the front; faces to the left and commands: 1. Sir Knights, 2. Return, 3. SWORDS, 4. DISMISSED. To Open Ranks 191. Being in line, at a halt: 1. Open ranks, 2. MARCH, 3. FRONT. At the first command the right and left guides step backward three paces (six back steps) to mark the new alignment of the rear rank; the platoon leaders place them - selves on the right and left of the front rank; the other file closers step back three paces in rear of the line of guides; the Commander goes to the right flank, and sees that the guides are on a line parallel to the front rank, then places himself facing the left, three paces in front of the right file, and commands: march, at which command, the platoon lead - ers place themselves three paces in front of the centers of their respective platoons; the front rank, the odd numbered j4 SCHOOL OF THE COMMANDERY 75 Knights, dress to the right; the even numbered Knights who constitute the rear rank, cast their eyes to the right, step backward, halt a little in rear of the alignment, and then dress to the right on the line established by the guides. The Commander superintends the alignment of the officers, and the front rank, and the right guide that of the rear rank; the Commander verifies the alignment of the rear rank and file closers, then places himself facing the left, three paces in front of the right file, gives the command front, and faces to the front. At the command front, the guides resume their places in the front rank, and the Knights cast their eyes to the front. The officers and file closers cast their eyes to the front as soon as their alignment is verifed. To Close Ranks 192. Being at a halt: 1. Close Ranks, 2. MARCH. At the command march, the platoon leaders face out - ward, and resume their places in line; the rear rank closes in quick time, each Knight resuming his place in line; the Com - mander takes his post.

At the command front, the right guide places himself on the right of the pivot. To continue the march upon completion of the wheel: 3. Forward, 4. MARCH. The command forward is given when the left guide arrives at three paces from the perpen - dicular, the command march, the instant the wheel is com - pleted. The right gui3e places himself beside the pivot, at the command forward. To Change Direction 194. R’Iarching in line: 1. Right (left) wheel, 2. MARCH, 3. Forward, 4. MARCH. At the command march, the com - mandery wheels to the right on a moving pivot; the command forward is given when the guid4 is at three paces from the perpendicular, and the fourth command, the instant the change of direction is complete. To Turn on a Fixed Pivot 195. Being in line: 1. Commandery (platoon) right (left), 2. MARCH, 3. Commandery, 4. HALT, or 3, Forward, 4. MARCH. At the second command the right flank Knight faces to the right and marks time; the other Knights oblique to the right; place themselves abreast the pivot Knight and mark time. The right guide steps back, takes post on the flank and marks time. The fourth command is given when the last Knight arrives on the line. The command halt may be given at any time after the movement begins; only those halt who are in the new posi - tion; each of the others halt upon arriving on the line, aligns himself to the right, and executes front without command. To Turn on a Moving Pivot 196. Being in line: 1. Right (left) turn, 2. MARCH, 3. Forward, 4. MARCH. At the second command the pivot Knight faces to the right in marching and takes the half step. The other Knights oblique to the right until opposite their places in line, then execute a second right oblique and take the half step on 2i -A SCHOOL OF THE COMMA NDERY 77 arriving abreast of the pivot Knight. All glance toward the marching flank while at half step and take the full step as the last Knight arrives on the line, at the fourth command. Right (left) half turn is executed in a similar manner; the pivot Knight making a half change of direction to the right or left, and the other Knights making quarter changes of direction in obliquing. At the command halt, which may be given at any time after the movement begins, only those halt who are on the new alignment, the movement being completed as explained. To Form Column to the Right or Left 197. Being in line: 1. Threes right (left), 2. MARCH. At the command march, each three wheels to the right on a fixed pivot; upon the completion of the wheel the threes take the full step without further command, guiding to the left (marching flank). The guide of each three (the Knight on its left) preserves the distance of fifty-four inches frdm the three in his front (from breast to back). Both guides (Wardens) march forty-four inches to the front and face to the right in marching; the right guide places himself fifty- four inches in front of the left file of the first three, and marches on a line parallel to the former front of the com - mandery; the left guide follows at fifti -four inches in rear of the left file of the rear three; the file closers march at two paces from the flank of the column, on the side opposite to the guide, the platoon leaders opposite the centers of their respective platoons, the left guide of the first, and right guide of the second platoons are posted between the platoon leaders. To form column of threes and halt: 1. Threes right, 2. MARCH, 3. Commandery, 4. HALT. The fourth command is given the instant the threes complete the wheel.

To Oblique in Column 199. 1. Right (left) oblique, 2. MARCH. During the oblique, the different subdivisions preserve their parallelism; the Knight in each rank, on the side toward which the oblique is made, is the guide of that rank. The leading guide is guide of the column when the oblique is toward his flank; when the oblique is toward the opposite flank, the guide of the leading subdivision is the guide of the column. To resume the direct march: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH. The guides, during the oblique, cover in trace parallel to the original direction. If halted while obliquing, the swords being at a position other than carry, the Knights will, upon halting, bring their swords to a carry and halt faced to the front. If the command mark time be given while obliquing, the oblique march will be resumed b? the command: 1. Oblique, 2. MARCH. To Change Direction in Column of Threes or Sections 200. Being in march: 1. Column right (left), 2. MARCH. The leading rank wheels on a moving pivot, the wheel being completed, the guide takes his position. The other ranks move forward and wheel on the same ground. Column half right (left) is similarly executed. 201. To put the column in march and change direction at the same time: 1. Column right (or left), 2. MARCH. To March the Column of Threes to the Rear 202. 1. Threes left (right) about, 2. MARCH, 3. Guide right (left). 4 SCHOOL OF THE COMMANDERY 79 At the command march, the threes wheel about on fixed pivots. The guide at the head of the column faces to the left, and on the completion of the about, places himself in rear of the file on the marching flank of the rear three. The guide at the rear of the column faces to the left, and on the completion of the about, places himself in front of the file on the marching flank of the leading three. The file closers gain space to the left or right, necessary to preserve the in - terval of two paces from the flank of the column. The Com - mander faces about, and hastens to place himself on the right of the guide, at the head of the commandery. In column, the about is executed toward the side opposite the file closers. 203. Being in line, to perfect the commandery in wheel - ing by threes or sections: 1. Threes (sections) in circle, right (left) wheel, 2. MARCH. The threes complete each arc of ninety degrees simul - taneously. The principles of the fixed pivot are strictly en - forced, the Knight on the marching flank taking the full step. The threes having wheeled several times in circle: 1. Commandery, 2. HALT, or, 1. Forward, 2. MARCH. To Form Line from Column of Threes 204. 1. Three& left (right), 2. MARCH, 3. Guide right (left or center); or, 3. Commandery, 4. HALT. At the command march, the threes wheel to the left on fixed pivots. The guide, if in front of the pivot, faces to the left, placing himself on the right of the leading three upon the completion of the wheel; if in front of the marching flank, he wheels to the left with the leading three, obliquing to the right so as to uncover the file on the marching flank, placing himself on the right of the three as the wheel is com - pleted; the guide in the rear places himself on the left of the commandery; the guide is announced the instant the threes unite in line. If the line be formed toward the side of the file closers, they close in to the flank of the column at the first com - mand, and, at the command march, dart through the column.

To Form Line on the Right or Left from Column of Threes or Sections 205. 1. On right (left) into line, 2. MARCH, 3. Coin - mandery, 4. HALT, 5. FRONT. At the command march, the leading three wheels to the right on a moving pivot, and moves forward, dressing to the right, the guide places himself on its right to conduct it; each of the other threes marches a distance equal to its front beyond the wheeling point of the three next preceding, wheels to the right, and advances as explained for the first three; the rear guide places himself on the left when the rear three arrives on the line. At the command halt, given when the leading three has advanced commandery distance in the new direction, it halts, and dresses to the right; the other threes halt and dress successively upon arriving in line. At the fifth command, given when the left three completes its alignment, all the Knights turn their eyes to the front. If the movement be executed toward the side of the guide, each file closer follows the three nearest him, passing in front of the following three. 206. In these movements where it is prescribed that the - leading subdivision moves commandery distance to the front and then halts, it may be halted at a less distance when nec - essary. This rule is general. ro Form Line to the Front From Column of Threes or Sections 207. 1. Left (right) front into line, 2. MARCH, 3. Commandery, 4. HALT, 5. FRONT. At the command march, the first three moves straight to the front, aligning to the right on the leading guide, who places himself on its right flank; the other threes oblique to the left till opposite their places in line, when each in suc - cession marches to the front. At the command halt, given when the leadin% three has SCHOOL OF THE COMMANDERY 81 advanced commandery distance, it halts, and dresses to the right; the other threes halt, and dress to the right upon ar - riving in line. The guide in rear places himself on the left of the front rank upon the arrival of the last three in line; the fifth com - mand is given when the last three completes its alignment. If the movement is made toward the side of the file closers, they dart through the column at the command march. 205. If marching in double time, or in quick time and the command be double time, the leading three moves to the front in quick time, the other threes oblique in double time, each taking the quick time and dressing to the right upon arriving in line. This iule is general. To March the Line to the Rear 209. 1. Threes right (left) about, 2. MARCH, 3. Corn - mandery, 4. HALT; or, 3. Guide right (left). At the command march, the threes wheel about on fixed pivots; the Commander passes through the nearest interval and places himself three paces in front of the cehter of the commandery; the guides wheel about on the arc of a small circle; the file closers dai-t through the nearest intervals. To March a Few Paces to the Rear 210. Being at a halt: 1. About, 2. FACE, 3. Forward, 4. Guide right (left), 6. MARCH; or, if in march, by the commands: 1. To the rear, 2. MARCH, 3. Guide right (left). The file closers, upon facing about, maintain their rela - tive positions. To Break Threes to the Rear 211. Marching in line, to pass obstacles: 1.

The guide, if on that flank from which the threes were broken to the rear, at the command march, hastens to the point where the flank of the commandery will be when the movement is completed. At the command double time, those threes which execute the double time, bring their swords to shoulder swords, Par. 115; on arriving in line the swords are restored to the former position without command. 213. The column of threes is the habitual column of route, though any column of subdivisions may march in the route step, except column of files. F Being in march: 1. Route step, 2. MARCH. At the command march the officers carry their swords at will or in scabbards; the Knights carry their swords at will; they ‘are not required to preserve silence, or keep the step. To resume the cadenced step: 1. Commandery, 2. AT - TENTION. At the second command, the swords are brought to a carry, and the cadenced step is resumed. (The leading guide calls the cadence.) The commandery in line may also march in the route step. The commandery in route step changes direction by the same commands as when in the cadenced step. If halted when in route step the Knights come to rest. 214. To march at ease: 1. At ease, 2. MARCH. The commandery marches in route step, except that silence is preserved. To resume the march at attention: 1. Commandery, 2. ATTENTION. If halted marching at ease, the Knights re - main at ease. At ease may be taken from route step, and the reverse.

The guides precede and follow the leading and rear files. If marching, the leading file continues the march. The Commander places himself on the left of the leading guide. In forming column of files, the Commander commands: Right (left) by file, according as the right or left is in front. NOTE—Whenever a marching column is broken into smaller subdivisions, as right by twos, right by threes, right by sections, etc., the flank which breaks to the rear need not mark time, provided the command march is given as that foot strikes the ground, toward which the oblique is made. To Form Column of-Threes from Column of Files 216. This movement is always executed away from the file closers. 1. Form threes left oblique, 2. MARCH, 3. For - ward, 4. MARCH. At the command march, the leading file of each three takes the half step; the other files oblique to the left, and place themselves successively on the left of the leading file and take the half step.

Platoon, 2. HALT, 3. Left (right), 4. DRESS, 5. FRONT. At the command halt each left guide places his left arm against the breast of his chief, who then steps back two paces, dresses his platoon, and takes post two paces in front of its center. The right guides take post on the right of the pivot Knights at the command front. If in march, the commandery wheels into column of platoons by the same commands as at a halt. At the com - mand march, the guides halt and the pivots mark time; the chief of the rear platoon takes his post by passing between the platoons; the platoons are halted and dressed as before. Whenever the commandery is formed in column of platoons, or line of platoons in columns of threes, the file closers who act as guides of platoons, place themselves as such as soon as practicable, unless otherwise specifically stated. The Standard Guard, if present, moves straight to the front, nearly one-half platoon distance, wheels to the right on a moving pivot, advances to a point midway between the platoons, and halts. The position of the Commander is three paces in front of the chief of the leading platoon.

In like manner, sections are augmented to platoons, and platoons to commandery, which also wheels in circle on a fixed pivot. The guides do not describe a circle, but march in prolongation of the line a distance sufficient to permit the subdivision in the rear to wheel clear of them. The guides face with each quarter of the circle, and in the same direction with the subdivisions. When the marching flank passes the guide, he faces toward the center and marches on the pivot, facing to the front as the subdivisions unite in line. The guides alternately march away from, or toward the center, according as the subdivi - sions wheel toward, or away from them. The file closers mark time during the wheel by threes, and together with the guides take post in front of their respective platoons at the \\~%~ fifth command. At the eighth command, the guides take post on the marching flanks of their respective platoons; the chic Es taking post in front of the centers. At the ninth command, the right guide returns to his post on the right flank of the commandery, and the file closers to their posts in line. A var[ation of this movement is effected, by alternating the commands so that the threes whed to the right, the sections to the left, the platoons to the right, etc. The Standard Guard, if present, wheels in circle with the threes upon a fixed pivot; in the wheels by sections, it wheels upon a moving pivot, describing a circle large enough to en - able it to occupy its central position in column, and to unite with the sections in line. In the wheel by platoons, etc., it conforms to the same principles as in wheeling by sections.

The following movements are intended for public parade and display; they are arranged to conform to the gen - eral rules and principles previously laid down. In display drill, for the purpose of forming emblematic figures, the Commander is often required to exercise his in - genuity to its utmost. It is impossible always to have the same number of Knights injine; and a slight variation in the number present necessitates a change in the formation to produce the required results. To form the passion cross with twenty-four Knights if it is desired to change front the unit of three to the unit df four, the Commander causes fours to be counted at the for - mation of the commandery. lit is also necessary to have the commandery divided into four equal parts in order to form the Greek cross and S~pare. j~jPMarch from the Center in Column of Sections to the Front 288. 1.

A battalion is composed of two or more, not ex - ceeding six commanderies or companies, under one Coin - mander. Large commanderies may be formed into two or more companies of not less than twenty-four files each, as heretofore provided, Par. 173. When possible to do so, it is best to have the battalions composed of four commanderies or companies each, and in this school they will be so con - sidered. In this school the terms “commandery”, and “com - pany” are synonymous. While it is understood that the formation of the larger templar units will usually be confined to the ceremonies of grand commanderies, in the case of large commanderies, or where several commanderies are contiguous, permanent bat - talions or provisional battalions and regiments may be formed to the great interest and advantage of all concerned. 333. The senior officer present is the instructor, in the text he is designated as Battalion Commander. Since the battalion is not an administrative unit the staff is usually limited to two, the Adjutant and the Sergeant Major, 334. When the commandery is formed as a battalion the Eminent Commander will assume his proper position as Battalion Commander, or will designate one quaiified to do so, who may be the Generalissimo, the Captain General, a Past Commander, or other competent Sir Knight. 335. Companies in the same commandery may be desig - nated by numerals or letters, as First, Second, Third, etc., or Co. “A”, Co. “B”, Co. “C”, etc. 336. The following disposition of officers is suggested. The Generalissimo to command the First (right) com - pany, the Captain General the Fourth (left) company, the 130 r GENERAL RULES 131 Senior Warden as Adjutant, the Junior Warden as Sergeant Major. Past Commanders for other company leaders. 337. For ceremonies, and even for drills, it is better to equalize the commanderies by transferring Knights from the larger to the smaller, or by dividing large commanderies into two or more companies. 338. Commanderies take rank according to date of charter, and in forming battalion for ceiimonies, are posted in order of rank from right to left in line and head to rear in column. For drill or maneuvers they take position as di - rected by The battalion commander. Past Commanders and Past Grand Officers take rank ac - cording to the date of installation. When two or more battalions appear for parade the for - mation will be that of a regiment. The Regiment 339. A Regiment is composed of three battalions but these Regulations are applicable to a less or greater number. The senior officer present will command and will be desig - nated Regimental Commander. When the commandery is formed as a regiment the Eminent Commander assumes the command, under the title of Regimental Commander, or designates the Generalissimo or Captain General, a Past Commander, or other competent Sir Knight, to do so, the other officers of The commandery being proportionately increased in rank. 340. When several commanderies parade, they are ander the authority of the Grand Commander, who if present, may assume command; in the absence of the Grand Commander, the ranking Grand Officer present, may assume the command; in the absence of any Grand Officer, the Grand Commander may name an officer to take command, as his representative, or failing to do so, the officers of the Commanderies present will elect a commanding officer. The f±ommanding officer will designate the officers to command the several battalions, such officers appointing their own staff officers. 34t When the Grand Comrnanaer assumes command, xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv .stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus ni xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"r w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv .stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl wstichtingargus.nl w - si ic h ri ngargus.nl w - xli chi ingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv .stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv .stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv - stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl 132 THE REGIMENT unless otherwise ordered, the Deputy Grand Commander acts as Chief of Staff and Executive Officer; the Grand Senior Warden as Adjutant (Asst. Adjt. Geni.), the Grand Junior Warden as Sergeant Major, and the Grand Treasurer as Quartermaster, while the remaining Grand Officers and Past Grand Officers, take position on the staff of the Grand Com - mander; Past Grand Commanders on the left of the Grand Captain General. 342. The commanding officer and battalion command - ers are designated field officers. The remaining Grand Of - ficers and Past Grand Officers are designated staff officers. 343. The Grand Commander takes post in front of the center of the Regiment, a distance equal to about half its front. In column the Grand Commander with his staff rides at the head, twenty-four paces in front of the band. The staff is six paces in rear of the Grand Commander, formed from right to left as follows: Adjutant, other officers, ac - cording to rank, senior on the right. The Grand Standard Guard, with a trumpeter on its left, forms the rear line of the staff. 344. Field officers repeat commands whenever neces - sary; chiefs of commanderies, companies, and platoons only when prescribed. 345. All Grand Officers, and all field and staff officers, should be mounted, however, if not feasible to mount, all drills, ceremonies and parades of regiments and battalions may be executed on foot. At battalion drills the Adjutant and Sergeant Major should always be on foot. For street parades it is permissible for the Grand Commander and his staff to ride in carriages, the st4f following in column in order of rank. Orderlies to mounted officers should be mounted. 3-46. Battalions in line are posted in order from right to left, and in column from head to rear, according to the rank of the commanders. 347. The interval between battaliens i~ line is twenty- four paces. EVOLUTIONS OF THE BATTALION Position of Commanderies 348. Commanderies (companies) are designated numer - ically from right to left when in line, and from front to rear when in column, first commandery, second commandery, and so on. The numbers of commanderies change whenever by facing in the opposite direction, the left becomes the right of the line, and the rear the head of the column. If, in passing from line into column, the designation of commanderies is changed, they hold their line designation till the column is formed, when they take the column designation. In like man - ner, if in passing from column into line, the desiguation is changed, they hold the column designation till the line is formed when they take the line designation. Chiefs of commanderies caution (such) commandery, whenever the designation is changed. When the number of commanderies is even, those to the right of the center of the battalion, regardless of the position of the Standard, constitute The right wing, those to the left, the left wing. In drill, the left commandery of the right wing is desig - nated the right center commandery; the right &mmandery of the left wing, the left center commandery. The designa - tion of wings changes whenever the battalion faces in the opposite direction. When the number of commanderies is odd, the center commandery is part of the original right wing. Battalion Standard 349. The battalion Standard Guard is posted as the left three of the right center commandery until the battalion line is formed; when the commandery is halted in rear of the guides the Standard Guard, under the command of the S. B. moves into line and take post midway between the right and left center goides facing the front. In line the Standard Guard is between the wings, the interval between it and the guides is two paces. In line of commanderies in column of threes, sections or platoons, the Standard Guard is midway"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"C w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xvstichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl wsl chiingargus.nl w - si ic Ii U ngargus.nl w - slichtiflgargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv, stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv - stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl ‘34 SCHOOL OF THE BATTALION between the wings and on line with the chiefs. In close col - umn the Standard Guard is on the left flank of the color commandery. In column of commanderies, platoons or sections, the Standard Guard is midway between the wings and equl-dis - tant from the flanks of the column. In column of threes, the Standard is midway between the wings, preserving a distance of three paces from the guide in front. The Colors are delivered by the battalion commander into the hands of the Standard Bearers, and are escorted by the Standard Guard to the color-commandery, and in like manner escorted back. If, by movements of the battalion the Stan - dard Guard finds itself not between the wings, it takes post there as soon as practicable. The Standard Guard presents on receiving and parting with the colors; likewise the color commandery. Posts of Officers and Battalion Staff 350. In line and in line of columns the battalion com - mander is posted about twenty paces in front of the center of The battalion; this distance to be reduced when the front of the battalion is less than sixty paces. In column, he is on the side of the guide, abreast of its center and about twenty paces from it. As instructor, he goes wherever his presence is necessary. In column the Adjutant and Sergeant Major, each in his own wing, are on the side of the guide, opposite to and six paces from the head or rear of the column. In line, the Adjutant and Sergeant Major are opposite the right and left of the battalion, six paces in rear of the file closers. Chiefs of commanderies are posted three paces in front of their respective commands. The staff officers, in order of rank from right to left, take posts three paces in rear of the Battalion Commander. In formations for battalion drill they are dispensed with. In forming for street parade, they take post on the right of the battalion, six paces from its front rank. r THE BAND 135 The Band 351. The band is posted on the right of the battalion, the left of its front ranli twenty paces to the right of the battalion. Commands 352. Chief~ of commanderies repeat such preparatory commands as are to be immediately executed by their com - mands, as, forward, threes right, etc. The Sir Knights execute the commands, march and halt, - if applying to their commanderies, when given by the Com - mander. Chiefs do not repeat the commands of the battalion com - mander, for the manual of the sword, nor those commands which are not essential to the erecution of a movement by their commanderies as, close in mass, etc. To Form the Battalion 353. At the sound of the assembly, the commanderies form on their respective parade grounds; being formed, Ad - jutant’s call is sounded, at which the Senior and Junior War - dens (Adjutant and Sergeant Major), the latter on the left, and with swords in scabbards, march to the point where the base commandery is to form, the Adjutant posts the Ser - geant Major on the line at a little more than commandery distance from and facing himself. Both then draw swords. If mounted the, Adjutant proceeds to the point where the base commandery is to form; the Sergeant Major reports to him and is posted on the line, etc. The right and left guides of each commandery precdde it on the line by about twenty paces, in double time, and are posted as markers, at guide swords, by the Adjutant and Sergeant Major. The guides of the color (right center) commandery are the first to ar - rive, and are posted on the line facing the left (point of rest). The line of markers is prolonged to the right by the right and left guides of the commanderies of the right wing who are established facing the point of rest so that each is opposite the proper flank of his commandery when it is on the line; the left guide places himself about five paces from the right"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtirxgargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtirigargus.nl w. si c h t i ngargus.nl w . st I chtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w . stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv .stichtingargus.nl xv stichtingargus.nl xv .stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.n~ xv. stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl 136 SCHOOL OF THE BATTALION guide of the preceding commandery. The Adjutant aligns the guides in the right wing, placing himself in rear of the right guides as they successively arrive on the line. The line is similarly prolonged in the left wing by the Sergeant Major, who aligns the guides in their positions facing the right (point of rest), placing himself successively in rear of the left guides as they arrive on the line. 354. The guides, upon taking post on the line, bring their swords to the position of guide swords. Par. 111. This rule is general for all successive formations. 355. The color commandery (right center) is the first established, and is conducted by its chief so as to arrive from the rear, parallel to the line of markers. When it arrives at one pace from the line, the chief halts it, places himself near the left marker facing to the front, and dresses the command - ery to the left, the breasts of the Knights opposite the mark - ers resting against their arms; the commanderies of the right wing form successively from left to right, each being halted at one pace from the line and dressed to the left as explained for the color commandery. The commanderies of the left wing form successively from right to left, and are dressed to the right. Each commandery is halted and dressed so there is an in - terval of three paces between the guides when in line, 356. When approaching a line, a commandery is halted by its chief when it is about one pace in rear of the line of markers. When commanderies are to be aligned, chiefs place them - selves on that flank toward which the dress is to be made, facing to the front. Par. 131. Each chief, after dressing his commandery, commands: Front, and takes his post. These rules are general. 357. At the sounding of Adjutant’s call, the band, if present, marches together wiTh the commanderies to its posi - tion in line. The battalion commander takes post, facing the line, and at a distance in front of its center, about equal to one-half its front. 358. The Adjutant having assured the position of the r BATTALION DRILL :137 right guide of the right commandery, faces about, marches three paces to the right of the front rank, faces to the left, moves three paces to the front, faces to the left and halts, and, when the last commandery arriving on the line is brought to a front, commands: 1. Guides, 2. POSTS. At the command posts, the Sergeant Major and guides take their posts in line. The Adjutant moves at a trot (if dismounted, in quick time), by the shortest route to a point midway between the Commanders and the Battalion Commander, halts, faces about, brings The battalion to a present, resumes his fr 4 ont, salutes the Battalion Commander, and reports: Eminent Sir (or Right Eminent Sir), the battalion is formed. The Bat - talion Commander retains the salute with the right hand, directs the Adjutant, Take your post, Sir, draws his sword and commands: 1. Carry, 2. SWORDS. The Adjutant faces about, and returns to his post by the same gait and path as described above. 359. The battalion may be formed in line on the right or left commandery by the same principles; the guides being posted facing the point of rest; or, it may be assembled in column of threes; when assembled the Adjutant reports to the Battalion Commander as soon as the last commandery has taken its place. To Open Ranks 360. Being at a halt: I. Open ranks, 2. MARCH, 3. FRONT. The Battalion Commander remains in place facing the battalion. The Adjutant places himself facing to the left, three paces to The right and three paces to the rear of the front rank.

The Standard Guard, if present, stands fast dressing to the right. The band takes three paces be - tween ranks, the alignment being varied by the drum major from the right. The Adjutant verifies the alignment of the officers, both ranks, and the file closers, and then takes post facing to the front, three paces to the right of the hattalion, in line with the officers. The Battalion Commander gives the command front when the Adjutant tal<es his post. The guides and drum major return Jo their posts in line. Should the battalion have wheeled about by threes, the Sergeant Major performs the duties of the Adjutant. To Close Ranks 361. 1. Close ranks, 2. MARCH. At the command march, the platoon leaders face about and return to their posts in line, and ranks are closed. Par. 192. To Rest the Battalion 362. 1. Battalion, 2. REST, or AT EASE. To resume the attention, the Battalion Commander com - mands: 1. Battalion, 2. ATTENTION. 363., Dismiss your commanderies (companies), at which command, each Commander conducts his commandery to its parade ground, where it is dismissed, as prescribed in School of Commandery. The Standard Guard escorts the colors to the quarters of the Commanding Officer. To March in Line 364. The battalion being at a halt, and correctly aligned: 1. Forward, 2. Guide center (right or left), 3. MARCH. At the second command the chiefs caution second (or such) commandery guide left (right) according as they are in the right or left wings. This rule is general. At the command march, the battalion steps off promptly, guiding on the center; the Standard Bearer, charged with the r BATTALION DRILL step and direction, preserves with care the cadence and length of step, and selects points in advance on which to direct his march. The guides march abreast of the Standard Bearer, and in step with him. The chiefs, in front of the centers of their commanderies, see that the goides preserve a general alignment, without abruptly shortening or lengthening the step, and that they preserve the interval of three paces between commanderies. To effect a slight change of direction while marching, the Battalion Commander commands: Incline to the right (left) and indicates the new line of direction. The guide ad - vances his left shoulder, giving time for the alignment to conform to his movement. To Face the Battalion to the Rear and March It to the Rear 365. 1. Threes right (left) about, 2. MARCH, 3. Guide center (right or left). At the second’ command the battalion wheels about by threes; each chief of commandery and file closer darts through the nearest interval to their new positions in line. The Adjutant and Sergeant Major pass around the flanks to the rear of the line, and the battalion is maneuvered by the same commands and means as before. Should the battalion be halted on completing the about by threes, each chief dresses his commandery to the left, com - mands: Front, and places himself in front of its center. Should the battalion wheel by threes to the left about, the alignment would be to the right. 366. The battalion may be marched a few paces to the rear by the commands: 1. Battalion, 2. About, 3. FACE, 4. Forward, 5. Guide center, 6. MARCH; or, if in march, by the commands: 1. To the rear, 2. MARCH, 3. Guide center. The officers, guides, Standard Bearer, and file closers retain their relative positions until the battalion is again faced to the original front, until which no other movements will be executed. 367.

To Rectify the Alignment 368. Commanders, rectify the alignment. At this com - rnand, the chiefs to the right of the Standard hasten to place themselves on the left of their commanderies, and dress them successively to the left, each as soon as the chief on his left commands front; the chiefs to the left of the Standard place themselves on the right of their commanderies and dress them successively to the right; each chief returns to his place in line after commanding front. 369. To give the battalion a general alignment, the Battalion Commander moves outside one flank of the bat - talion, and commands: 1. Guides, center (right or left) corn - mandery on the line, 2. Guides on the line, 3. On the center (right or left), 4. DRESS, 5. Guides, 6. POSTS. At the first command, the designated guides place them - selves on the line, and face the center (right or left). Par. 107. The Battalion Commander establishes Them by motion of the sword in the direction he wishes to give the battalion. At the second command, The guides of the other com - manderies take the same posts as in forming battalion. At the fourth command, the commanderies move up in quick time against the guides, where, having arrived, each chief dresses his commandery to the flank toward which his guides face. If the new line be oblique, and at a considerable distance from the battalion, the chiefs remain in front of their com - manderies, and conduct them with the guide toward the cen - ter, so as to arrive parallel to the line, where they halt and dress as before explained. At the sixth command, guides return to their posts in line. If the new direction of the line be such that one or more commanderies find themselves in advance of it, the Battalion Commander, before establishing the guides, causes these commanderies to be moved to the rear. r BATTALION DRILL 141 To Pass Obstacles £40. Marching in line: 1. (Such) Commandery (or Commanderies) obstacle, 2. MARCH. If the obstacle covers but one commandery, its chief commands: 1. (Such) Commandery, 2. Left by threes, or, 2. Right by threes, according as he is on the right or left of the center; after repeating the command march, he places him - self beside the leading three of his command, which con - tinues to march in line. The guide of the commandery in line next toward the flank of the battalion, marches abreast of the basis of alignment, and preserves the interval neces - sary for the commandery broken to the rear to form again into line. If the obstacle covers the color commandery, it breaks into column of threes, with the Standard Guard in front. If the obstacle covers two commanderies not on the flank of the battalion, each breaks into column of threes, with the leading three of each commandery marching in line; the chief of the commandery farthest from the Standard places him - self on The inner flank of the leading three, and preserves the interval necessary for the two commanderies to reform into line. Pat. 211. 371. When the obstacle is passed: 1. (Such) command - ery (or commanderies) into line, 2. MARCH. At the first command, the chief commands: 1. Right (left) front into line, 2. Double time. At the command march, repeated by the chief, the com - mandery broken to the rear executes front into line in double time. If obstacles are passed in double time, the battalion is brought to quick time before reforming line. When marching in line, and obstacles are encountered covering a part of the commandery, its chief, without intimation from the Battalion Commander, breaks threes to the rear, causing them to re - form line as soon as the obstacles are passed.

Successive formations include all those formations BATTALION DRILL 143 where the several subdivisions arrive successively upon the line; such as front into line, the deployments of columns, formations into line by two movements, changes of front, etc. (a) In all successive formations, except formation into line by two movements, the Adjutant and Sergeant Major, who is at the head of the column, or nearest the point ot rest, establishes the two markers on the line opposite the right and left files of the subdivision first to arrive on the line. Both markers face toward the point of rest. If the f or - mation be central they are placed on the line in front of the leading subdivision, facing to the center. Guides precede their commanderies on the line by about twenty paces, and in double time, and take the position of guide swords. (b) In all formations from a halt, the markers are estab - lished at the preparatory command, indicating the direction in which the line is to extend; if marching, they hasten toward the point of rest at the preparatory command, and are established at the command march. In formation on right (left) into line, the first marker is established com - mandery distance to the right (left) of the head of the column. (c) In formations front into line from column of threes or sections, they are posted commandery distance in front of the head of the column. In column of commanderies they are posted against the leading commandery. (d) In the deployments, they are posted against the lead - ing commandery or the head of the column, when the deploy - ment is on the first subdivision; and six paces in front of the column, when the deployment is on a subdivision in rear. (e) In changes of front, the first marker is posted com - mandery distance to the right of the first, or left of the fourth commandery according as the change of front is to the right or left. The line is prolonged in the manner previously explained in formation of the battalion (Par. 353), by the guides of each commandery who are farthest from the point of rest; the guides are assured, as they successively arrive, by the officer at the head of the column, or nearest the point of rest. If the formation be central, the Adjutant and Sergeant Major establish the guides of their own wings.

The bat - talions are brought to attention by the Regimental Com - mander before executing another movement. When the de - sired formation admits of the simultaneous execution of movements by battalions or companies, the Regimental Com - mander may execute the movements prescribed in the School of the Battalion by prefixing Battalions or Companies to the commands. Formation of the Regiment 411. The regiment is formed by battalions, either in line or in line of masses. It may also be formed in more than one line, and also be formed in column or in line of columns. The battalions are posted from right to left according to the rank of Battalion Commanders present, the senior on the right. A battalion whose Commander is temporarily in command of the regiment retains its place in line. Except for ceremonies the battalions may be posted at the discretion of the Regimental Commander. In whatever direction the regiment faces, the battalions are designated from the right when in line, from the head to rear when in column, first battalion, second battalion, etc. If in two lines, those in the first line are designated from The right, first and second; in the second line, third, etc. In forming the line, the Adjutant indicates to the Ad - jutant of the base battalion the point of rest and the direction the line is to extend, and then takes post facing the line, about thirty paces in front of its center. In forming in more than one line, the other battalions are posted as directed by the Regimental Commander, the Adjutant, if necessary, indicating to the Battalion Adjutants their points of rest and direction. The non-commissioned staff takes post as the last battalion is formed. The forma - tion completed, the Adjutant brings the regiment to atten - tion, if not already there, by the commands: 1. Battalions, 2. ATTENTION, and then commands: 1. Present, 2. SWORDS; each Battalion Commander brings his battalion to attention and present; the adjutant salutes the Regimental Commander and reports: Sir, the regiment is formed; the Regimental Commander returns the salute with the right hand, directs REGIMENTAL DRILL 159 the adjutant: Take your post, Sir; draws sword and brings the regiment to the carry. The Adjutant tak6s post by pass - ing by the Regimental Commander’s right. 412. To dismiss the regiment, Open and Close Ranks, the Rests, Marchings, Halts, Alignments, Formations and movements in mass, are executed as described in the Evolu - tions of the Battalion, by each battalion, simultaneously or successively, at the command of its chief. Successive Formations 413. The Adjutant or Sergeant Major of each battalion precedes it on the line to indicate the point of rest. The guides of the leading commandery of the base bat - talion are the first established. The guides of the leading commanderies of the rear bat - talions are established facing the point of rest of the regi - mental line, the nearest guide being twenty-four paces from the flank of the battalion next preceding it. The distance in column of battalions, or when formed in two lines, is the front of a battalion in line and twenty-four paces; this may be increased or diminished, the Regimental Commander sending orders specifying the distance to the Commanders of the rear battalions, or sending a staff officer to indicate the points of rest.

The brigade consists of three regiments, but the rules here prescribed are applicable to a less or greater num - ber. It is commanded by a Brigade Commander (Marshal). Regiments in line are designated right, center and left; or if one be in the rear, right, left and rear; in column they are designated leading, center and rear. Unless otherwise directed by the Brigade Commander, the regiments are posted according to the rank of the Regi - mental Commanders, Far. 338; in line, from right to left, ‘the senior on the right; in two or three lines by regiments, the senior in the first line, the junior in the rear line; in column, from head to rear, the senior at the head. The interval between regiments is forty-eight paces. In line the Commander takes post one hundred paces in front of the center of the brigade; in column at the head of the brigade. The staff is six paces in rear of the Brigade Command - er; in the following order from right to left: The Chief of Staff, Adjutant General, aids in order of rank. The orderlies are three paces in rear of the staff. The regulations for the evolutions of the regiment are applicable to the brigade. In moving into position, the regi - ments and battalions are habitually marched in column of threes by the shortest practicable lines. The Commander of the base battalion, when indicated, if marching, commands: Attention. Each of the other Com - manders commands: Attention, on approaching the point where he gives his command for placing his battalion in posi - tion in the new formation. Each Battalion Commander com - mands rest when his battalion is in position. w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w .stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl wsI ichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingargus.n I RE VIEWS General Rules 436. In the review of large templar bodies, the reiYiew - ing officer and field and staff officers, non-commissioned staff and orderlies, are usually mounted. The same general rules and principles, however, will be followed in the review of all bodies of Knights Templar, large or small, indoors or out of doors, and whether mounted or dismounted. The Adjutant posts men or otherwse marks the line of march of the column in such manner that its flank in passing will be about twelve paces from the reviewing officer. The post of the reviewing officer is indicated by a marker. Officers of the same grade as the reviewing officer or of higher grade, and distinguished personages invited to ac - company him, place themselves on his left or as otherwise ~ndicated; their staffs and orderlies place themselves, res - pectively, on the corresponding side of the staff and orderlies of the reviewing officer; all otheis who accompany the re - viewing officer place themselves on the left of his staff or as otherwise indicated, their orderlies in rear. A staff officer is designated to escort distinguished personages and to indi - cate to them their proper positions. 437. While moving around the lines, the reviewing offi - cer may direct that his staff and orderiies remain at the post of the reviewing officer, or that only his personal staff ac - company him; in either case, the commanding officer alone accompanies the reviewing officer. While passing around the lines, the commanding officer is on the flank of the reviewing officer away from the command. If the reviewing officer is accompanied by his entire staff, the staff officers of the Commander place themselves on the side of the staff of the reviewing officer corresponding to the position of the Com - mander. 165"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nI ws icht’ngargus.nl w siic ht i ngargus.nI w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w sdchtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I 166 CEREMONIES The reviewing officer and others at the reviewing stand salute the National Flag as it passes, whether the State Color and Beauceant salute or not; those with swords not drawn salute by uncovering; when passing around the lines the re - viewing officer and those accompanying him salute the Na - tional Flag when passing in front of it. The reviewing officer returns the salute of the command - ing officer of the lines only. Those who accompany the reviewing officer do not salute. 438. In passing in review, each staff salutes with its Commander. Without facing about, each sub-division leader commands: 1. Eyes, in time to add: 2. RIGHT, when at six paces from the reviewing officer, and commands: FRONT, when at six paces beyond him. At the command eyes, offi - cers execute the first motion of present sword; at the com - mand RIGHT, all turn the head and eyes to the right and the officers complete salute sword; at the command FRONT, all turn the head and eyes to the front, the officers resuming the carry sword. Knights in ranks do not salute. The junior officers staff, junior officers in command of subdivisions and the drum major, salute, turn the head and eyes, return to the front, resume the carry or drop the hand at the points prescribed for the Battalion Commander. Offi - cers and junior officers staff, with swords in scabbards, salute with the hand. Guides charged with step, trace, and direction, do not execute eyes right. 439. After saluting the reviewin~ officer in passing in review, the commanding officer of the lines turns out of the column and takes post on the side of the reviewing officer toward the direction of march of the command; the members of his staff accompany him, take post on the corresponding side of the reviewing officer’s staff. When the rear element of his command has passed, the commanding officer of the lines, without changing his position, salutes the reviewing officer; he and the members of his staff accompanying him then rejoin the command. The coenpianding officer of the lines and the members of his staff are the only ones who turn out of the column and take post at the side of the re - viewing officer. REVIEWS 167 440. If the person reviewing the command is not mounted, the commanding officer and his staff, on turning out of the column after passing the reviewing officer, dis - mount preparatory to taking post. In such case, the salute of the commanding officer, prior to rejoining his command, is made with the hand before remounting. 441. When the rank of the reviewing officer entitles hiro. to the honor, each beauceant and state color salutes at the command Present swords, given or repeated by the Com - mander of the battalion with which it is posted; and again in passing in review. 442. The band of an organization plays while the re - viewing officer is passing in front and in rear of the organi - zation. During the march in review each band turns out of the column, takes post as hereinafter prescribed or as otherwise directed, continues to play until its regiment has passed, then ceases playing and follows in rear of its regiment; the band of the following regiment commences to play as soon as the preceding band has ceased. While marching in review but one band in each brigade plays at a time, and but one band at a time when within 100 paces of the reviewing officer. In large commands bands may be massed and posted as directed by the commanding officer. If the rank of the reviewing officer entitles him to the honor, the band plays the prescribed national air or the field music sounds to the color, march, flourishes, or ruffles when arms are presented. When passing in review, at the moment the State Color and Beauecant salute, the musicians posted with the band sound to the color, march, flourishes, or ruffles. 413.

L PROPER DISPLAY OF THE AMERICAN FLAG 460. NOTE—The following code of flag etiquette, was adopted at a convention held in Washington, D. C., June 14, 1923 (Flag day). There were representatives present from sixty-eight National Patriotic organizations including the American Legion, American Red Cross, and experts frQm the Army and Navy. A permanent organization of the confer - ence was effected. The action is of course binding upon all the civil organizations represented, and while not having gov - ernment sanction, is doubtless the most authoritative and well considered utterance ever given on the subject. The in - structions are in accord with the fundamental rules of Her - aldry. It should be remembered that the American Flag represents the living country and is itself considered a living thing. The union of the flag is the honor point, the right arm the sword arm, and therefore the point of danger and the place of honor. Rules 1. The Flag should be displayed only from sunrise to sunset, or between such hours as may be designated by pro - per authority. It should be displayed on National and State holidays and on historic and special occasions. The Flag should always be hoisted briskly and lowered slowly and ceremoniously. 2. When carried in a procession with another flag or flags, the Flag of the United States should be either on the marching right, i. e., the Flag’s own right, or when there is a line of other flags the Flag of the United States may be in front of the center of that line. 3. When displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, the Flag of the United States should be on the right, the Flag’s own right, and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag. 4. When a number of flags are grouped and displayed from staffs, the Flag of the United States should be in the center or at the highest point of the group."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"n~r~--~ -~ - I w. stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus. ni w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w st icht i ngargus.nl w xl ich tingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w . stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichiingargus.nI w.stichtingarguts.nI w.stichtingargus.nI wstichiingargu s H w stichtingargus.nI 184 DiSPLAY OF THE FLAG 5. When flags of States or cities or pennants of so - cieties are flown on the same halyard with the Flag of the United States, the National Flag should always be at the peak. When flown from adjacent staffs the Flag of the United States should be hoisted first. No flag or pennant should be placed above or to the right of the Flag of the United States. 6. When flags of two or more nations are displayed they should be flown from separate staffs of the same height and the flags should be of approx[mately equal size. (International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another in time of peace.) 7. When the Flag is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of bui]ding, the union of the Flag should go ckar to the head of the staff unless the Flag is at half mast. S. When the Flag of the United States is displayed in a manner other than by being flown from a staff it should be displayed flat, whether indoors or out. When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the Flag’s own right, i. e., to the observer’s left. When displayed in a window it should be displayed the same way, that is, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street. When fes - toons, rosettes or drapings of blue, white and red are de - sired, bunting should be used, but never the flag. 9. When displayed over the middle of the street, as between buildings, the Flag of the United States should be suspended vertically with the union to the north in an east- and-west street or to the east in a north-and-south street. 10. When used on a speaker’s platform, the Flag should be displayed above and behind the speaker. It should never be used to cover the speaker’s desk nor to drape over the front of the platform. If flown from a staff it should be on the ~speaker’s front. 11. When used in unveiling a statue or monument, the Flag should not be allowed to fall to the ground but should be carried aloft to wave out, forming a distinctive feature during the remainder of the ceremony. 12. When flown at half mast, the Flag is first hoisted DISPLAY OF THE FLAG to the peak and then lowered to the half staff position, but before lowering the Flag for the day it is raised again to the peak. On Memorial Day, May 30, the Flag is displayed at half mast from sunrise until noon and at full staff from noon until sunset, for the Nation lives and the Flag is the symbol of the living Nation. 13. When used to cover a casket the Flag should be placed so that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder. The Flag should not be lowered into the grave nor allowed to touch the ground. The casket should be carried foot first. 14. When the Flag is displayed in church, it should be from a staff placed on the congregation’s right as they face the clergyman. The service flag, the State flag, or other flags should be at the left of the congregation. If in the chancel, the Flag of the United States should be placed on the clergyman’s right as he faces the congregation arid the other flags on his left. 15. When the Flag is in such a condition that it is no Longer a fitting emblem for display it should not be cast aside or used in any way that might be viewed as disrespectful to the National colors, but should be destroyed as a whole, pri - vately, preferably by burning or by some other method in harmony with the reverence and respect we owe to the em - b~em representing our country. Cautions 1. Do not permit disrespect to be shown to the Flag of the United States. 2. Do not dip the Flag of the United States to any per - son or any thing. The regimental color,. State flag, organi - zation or institutional f[ag will render this honor. 3. Do not display the Flag of the United States w[th the union down except as a signal of distress. 4.
