[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Publisher’s Announcement Ezra A. Cook, who founded this publishing business in 1867, was unalterably opposed to secret orders. While many of our publications reflect his spirit, our books have been extensively adopted as text books In conferring the secret work of all standard orders, and the publishers, in continuing their sale, believe they are filling a much felt want. In further Justification, we submit the following from the pen of a noted Masonic authority. This quotation will natur - ally apply to treatises upon other secret orders:— “The objection to treatises and disquisitions on Masonic subjects, that there is danger through them of giving too much light to the world without, has not the slightest support fronf experience. In England, in France, and In Germany, scarcely any ~‘estriction has been observed by Masonic writers, except as to what is emphatically esoteric; and yet we do not believe that the profane world is wiser in those countries than in our own in respect to the secrets of F’reemasonry. In the face of these publications, the world without has remained as ignorant of the aporrheta of our art, as if no work had ever been written on the subject, while the world within—the Craft themselves—have been enlightened and instructed, and their views of Masonry (not as a social or charitable society, but as a philosophy, a science, a relig!on’~, have been elevated and enlarg~d. The truth is that men who are not Masons never read au - thentic Masonic works. They have no interest in the topics discussed, and could not understand them, from a want of the preparatory education which the Lodge alone can supply. Therefore, were a writer even to trench a little on what may be considered as being really the ‘arcana’ of Masonry, there is no danger of his thus making an improper revelation to improper persons.”—Mackey, Ency. of Freemasonry, 1887 ed., p. 617.

This volume is designed as a companion to “Free - masonry Illustrated,” issued in Jtily, 1879, the third edition of which has just been issued. In the preface of that work the following language is used: “To strengthen the testimony of these godly men, [seceders who had testified against the lddge and exposed its so- called secrets] and by a most rigid examination and cross-examination of the wflnesses of the defendant ]n this struggle against the powers of darkness to prove that the published revelations of Freemasonry are cor - reeL, and that the doctrines inculcated in i~s ritual and cerernonie~, as statcd by th~ highest Masonic authori - ties, arc more damning than any one would dream from the mere perusal of the ritual and its horrible oaths, is the object of this volume. To accomplish this the nionitorial part which is inserted in the body of the degrees, is quotcd from standard Masonic monitors, and nearly four hundred foot notes, which consist of extracts from standard Masonic publications, confirm me expo - sition in &.rery important particular, even to the oaths and murderous penalties. We thus put on the witness stand Dr. Albert G. Mackey, Daniel Sickels, Robert Morris and A. T. C. Pierson, each of whom is a su - preme ruler of the order, 33d degree, with the title of Sovereign Grand Inspectot General. We shall see whether any attempt will be made to impeach their testimony, which is terribly damaging to the order.” Sixijeen months have passed since that work was is - sued and our fondest hopes have been realized.

PtTBLISHER’S PREFACE. 5 • only has no champion of the order been foolhardy enough to assail this book, but so overwhellning is the mass of Masonic testimony quoted, that to our knowl - edge lodges in some localities where the book has been clrculated have not only ceased making Masons, but rarely hold a lodge meeting, and the Worshipful Mas - ter of one of these suspended lodges recently being rallied upon the fact that the lodge so rarely met, an - swered “The fact is, Mr. , you can make Masons cheaper than we can.” Mr. had been zealously circulating “Freemasonry Illustrated” in his neighbor - hood. Before issuing the work referred to, our plan included another volume giving the Council and Encampment degrees, and we had hoped that “President BlaneharXs pen like a trenehent broadsword” might be employcd on this work also, but God has ordered otherwise. Whether the spirit of this Elijah of the reform against the lodge has in any measure come upon the writer the reader must judge. Certain it is that our work has been accompanied by much prayer to God for divine wisdom. Though the issue of this volume was planned some • time ago, other duties had so crowded upon us that not until the “Great Knights Tern plar Triennial Conclave” in this city was close at hand were we aroused to the importance of the imrnecliatc issue of this work. As public attention has, in an unusual degree, been called to -the higher Masonic degrees by the Chicago Knights Teinpiar Conclave we are hopeful that the character of Knight Teniplarism may receive, such an investigation as it deserves, and since this volume con - tains not only the most complete a~d accurate ritual of these degrees extant, but nearly two hundred different quotations from standard Masonic authors, it does not seem presumptuous to hope that this book may prove of great value as a sort of encyclopedia of Knight Tem - plarism. ~iJt is true that the first three degrees of the volume form no part of the Commandery degrees, and some Knights Templar have never taken them, but no careful observer will fail to see that Satanic ingenuity could scarce have contrived ceremonies better calculated to completely terrorize and enslave souls and prepare them to do his bidding. Nor are we dependent upon the ritual and ceremonies themselves for this conclu - sion; IDr. Albert G. Mackey, Daniel Siekels and ilobert Morris, each “Sovereign Grand Inspector General” of the order give such overwhelmingly damaging testimony against the order as quoted in the foot notes and inoni - tonal part, that to read their testimony alone must con - vince every patriot and particularly every Christian that Freemasonry is utterly incompatible with repub - lican institutions and in the highest degree antagonistic to Christianity. In reference to the Council degrcc~ the attention of the reader is particularly called to pages 121-123, where the testimony of Mackey ought to settle the question of the character and design of Freemasonrx beyond all dispute. Thus far we have called attention particularly to the Council degrees, not because they are worse than those of the Commandery, for the re• verse is true, but they are first in regular order. The reader will observe that the three Commandery degrees are all knightly or mihtary or(lers, yet profes - sedly religious. Were it not that Freemasonry from first to last is a system of deception and falsehood, there would be ~ea son for surprise at the conflicting testi inony"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"6 PLTBLIS HER’S PREFACE. of Mackey and Morris as to the connection of the mod - ern order with the Templars of the Crusades. Some will 4 be not a little astonished to see that with refer - ence to this order IDr. Morris frankly admits the his - toric fact (note 119) that “wealth and prosperity natu - rally led to licentiousness, neglect of Templar law and in the end destruction.” As soon as the Christian public realize what a hide - ou~ly blasphemous, heaven-defying order is in their midst, professedly a defense of Christianity, nay more, professing to be “intensely Christian” (Morris IDict., Art. Chri~tian Masonry), we believe as certain destruc - tion awaits the order of modern Knights Templar. ~‘or overwhelmillg Masonic evidence that the decep - tion and blaspllemy practiced in these degrees and or - ders can not be painted in too dark colors, the reader is referred to Chapters I. and II., pages 121-123 and pages 282-285, and to notes 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 32, 35, 36, 38, 44, 46, 55, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 74, 81, 84, 85, 86, 88, 89, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98, 101, 110, 111, 131, 132 and 134. The monitorial quotations all through the de - grees prove conclusively the blasphemous use of the Word of God, and the impious representation even of the life, sufferings, ftsurreetion and ascension of the Lord Jesus. EznA A. CooK. Chicago, Nov. 1, 1880. REVISER’S PREFACE Free Masonry Illustrated has been for about twenty- five years before the public, the last edition having been published in 1904. This edition being exhausted, I have been desired by the publisher to go over the book, making such suggestions as seem to me helpful. I hesitate somewhat to do so. Those who knew Presi - dent Jonathan Blanchard do not need to be told of the powerful manner in which he wrote concerning the evils of secret societies, and all other institutions which seemed to him hostile to the teachings of the Holy Scripture and the interests of mankind. I have, therefore, done this work as well as I lnight and with some diffidence, and the sincere prayer that God may bless the work committed to the public which must read and judge. It is not improper in this connection to say a single word respecting the contribution which the publisher has made to the great discussion of the secret society movement in our country and age. He was associated with President Jonathan Blanchard from the begin - ning of the movement. Personally he was a quiet, earnest man, but devoted himself with prayer and self- forgetfulness to the proclamation of unpopular truths. It is a pleasure, as well as a duty, to testify to the earnestness, the charity and the self-sacrifice with which he has done his work. No man who knew him well is likely to question the propriety of the ad - jectives just used, and the many who have rejoiced in his testimony, and who have been delivered from the traps, snares and pitfalls which the secret society system has placed for the feet of the unwary, will sympathize with him in these days of his weakness and affliction; and will pray that all Divine blessing may rest upon him and his household.

The United States of Alnerica is the great secret. society nation of the world. Secret societies being parasites an(l living upon institutions which are al)lc to furnish them with sustenance, have comparatively small place in savage, semi-civilized and aristocratic countries. The (Jlmristian religion makes Iflen free, and increases their leisure and their property. A man who earns from three to ten cents a day as in Jndia, China or Africa, will not have a great deal of time or money to spend upon lodges. A hard working Ger - man peasant who earns forty dollars a year by long days of hard labor, does not furnish a very favorable object for secret society plunderers. Where wages are high and hours of labor are comparatively short, and where opinion, speech and assemblage are free, secret societies find their most fertile soil. Thus it has been that the country which was settled by Puritans, Covenanters, by Hollander~, by Huguenots and Luth - erans, all of whom by teaching and example condemn secret associations, is a country where secret associa - tions most flourish. A new generation arises which does not know Joseph. The sons of the Pilgrims glorify their fathers with words, and turn their backs upon their examples. It is also natural that in the United States secret societies should find their strongest adherents in the South, where for two hundred years and more white men lived on the unrequited toil of black men, thus having money and time to spend on secret societies. Masonic historians teach us that the Council Degrees were introduced into America in Charleston, South Carolina. Albert G. Mackey gives the names of the Grand Council of Princes of Jerusalem which received through a certain Brother Myers from Frederick III, King of Prussia, certified copies of the Council De - grees. ‘‘Although these degrees were once exclusively under the control of the Supreme ‘Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite,” we are assured by I\\lackey that ‘‘the first of the three Council de - grees is not ancient, so it is fair to presume that the rest are not.” The preiense of antiquity, which is so common among lodge men, is one of the strange things co~neeted with these Orders. Organizations which ar~ formed in our own time, and which are confessedly of the most modern origin, frequently as - sume the title ‘‘ancient” as the badge of their or - ganizations. Why they should do this is a mystery. That they do it, all moderately ~vell informed persons know. We may therefore conclude this section by say - ing that the degrees of Royal, Select and Superexcel - lent i\\’Iasters are modern degrees, probably invented among the infl(lels of Germany, introduced into this country in Charleston, South Carolina, and now con - ferred in Councils of Royal and Select Masters throughout the bounds of the Nation THE HISTORY OF THE COMMANDERY DEGREES The Commandery degrees, Knights of the Red Cross, Knights Telnpiar and Knights of Malta, are also modern creations. There is a strange inconsist - ency in the Masonic historians as they write respect - ing them.

Some of these writers speak of the Knights in terms of highest praise (Mackey’s Lexicon of Free Masonry, article, Knigllt Templary) ; others of them tell us plainly that they were a cruel, licentious, unprincipled class of men. What little honor they had was expen~1ed among them - selves. Regarding the masses of the people they were an unmitigated shame and curse. (Note 114, page 231, i\\iorris.) In this confusion and discord of Ma - sonic writers, we are thrown back upon our own reason and observation. Secrecy naturally leads to evil. ‘‘Out of the dark - ness dark deeds grow.” No fairly intelligent man dQubts that all help ful, wholesome enterprises are open, and that all shameful and malevolent organiza - tions are naturally secret in character. The slightest reflection makes this perfectly plain. Homes are open. Houses of shame are concealed. Men comne and go from the one freely and in the light; men come and go from the others secretly and in the dark. Of course there arc cases where shame i~ lost and this latter re - mark does not apply to, but generally speaking it is absolutely true. The same thing may be said respect - ing a manufactory of goods for the needs of men, and a manufactory for the coining of counterfeit currency. The sarmie thing can be said about an assemblage for the worship of God in a church, and an assemblage of men for the purpose of stealing horses or cattle. Hon - est things naturally seek the light; dishonest and evil things naturally seek the cover of secrecy; and the secrecy in many instances produces the evil which it afterward seeks to hide. So here we find that pro - visions which are needless for any good purpose will always be devoted to some evil one. Reason declares that this must be done; experience shows that it is. 1(NIGHT TEMPLARISM NOT OF THE MIDDLE AGES. 21 We may conclude here, as in respect to the degrees of Royal, Select and Superexeelleilt Masters, by say - ing that the degrees of the Red Cross, the Knights Templar and the Knights of Malta are modern de - grees invented for various purposes, e. g., to gratify the vanity of men, to secure power, to secure immnun - ity from crime. We are compelled to affirm that they have no connection Whatever with the Knight Temp - larism of time middle ages. It would be no particular credit to them if they were, but they have no such relation, and their pretense to antiquity must be set down as another falsehood used by the advocates of Templarism as a recommendation for the institution, which thoroughly understood, must be universally condemned."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ChAPTER II CHARACTER OP TIlE COUNCIL AND COMMANDERY DEGREES A Pretense of Some Valuable End to Be Secured.—Charac - teristics of Knight Templarism Secrecy, and Obedience.— The Order Seeks to Meet Mans Need of qhrist in the Soul.— Penalties cf the Knight Ternplar Dcgrees Call for Murder.—The Lodge a Continuous Education for Murder.—The Five Libations. —Members Must Yield Private Judgment.—Why Are Good Men in Lodges?—The Unpardonable Crime of Masonry Is Disobedi - ence.—Follow Christ’s Commands Rather Than the Instructions of the Lodge.—If Any Man Have Not the Spirit of Christ He is None of Ills. There is a very wearisome similarity in the Rituals of all secret societies. The character of such orders is es~entially the same. If you know one, you in fact know them all. This is true both of the ancient and of the modern secret societies. . The mysteries of India. Grecce, Rome and Africa did not essentially differ. The secret societies of our own time are also the same in their fundamental principles. There are different names, regallias, and forms of words, but the under - lying principles are everywhere identical. For ex - ample: There is always a pretense of some good to be gained. This is of course irnavoidable. Mackey, speak - ing of the degree Royal Master, says that “the cere - monies of this degr2e present one great idea, the truly Masonic one of the laborer seeking for his reward. Through all the symbolism of Masonry from the first to the last degree the search for the word has been considered as a symbolic expression for the search for A PRETENCE OF A VALUABLE END TO BE SECURED. 23 truth. The attaining of this truth has always been counted to be the great object and design of all Masonic labor.”~~MaCkeY’s Rttuattst, page 507. Why one who is seeking to attain truth should hand himself with other men in a secret society he does not even pretend to say. In like manner men tell us that patriotiSni and brotherhood, relief of suffering and growth in knowledge, are the purposes of one secret society and another; and in all these cases there is no explanation even attempted of the relation between secrecy and the object which is to be secured; but always a pretense of some valuable end to be secured. SECRET SOCIETIES RELIGIOUS Another universal fact in secret societies which is very clearly exemplified in the degrees of Royal, Se - lect and Superexcellent Masters is that all these or - ganizations, first or last, in some way or other, deal with the religious needs of man. God has so con - structed the human soul that it reaches out for super - human help. The sense of weakness, the sense of sin, an intimation of immorality, a dread of what it may bring, and the desire for happiness in it, are the common inheritance of the race. At times the re - ligious sense is dulled, pushed into the background, dwarfed, perhaps occasionally seems dead; but in every instance there is a terrible awakening, and in some way or other men seek to satisfy the religious longingS of their souls. Christian faith is intended to do two things: first, to help men to live comfortably and well in this world, and in the second place to help men to go into the coming life with hope and joy and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"24 KNIGHT TEMPLARISM COUNTERFEITS RELIGION. SEEKS TO SUPPLY MAN’S NEED OF CHRIST. 25 blessedness. In some form or other, to some degree or other, lodges seek to meet these two needs, and the degrees of the Council of Royal and Select Masters are like all the rest. For example: Mackey, in his Ritualist, page 549, speaking of the Select Master’s degree, says: “The Masonic stone of foundation so conspicuous in the degrei~ of Select Master, is a symbol of Divine Truth, upon which all speculative Masonry is built, and the legends and traditions which refer to it are intended to describe in an allegorical way the progress of truth in the soul, the search for which is a Mason’s labor, and the discovery of which is to be Ilis reward.” Truth practised becomes virtue. That is, virtuous action is action according to the facts of the case. When we treat men and things according to their real nature we live virtuously. If we really attain to truth in our hearts we shall live wisely and well in our lives. This is the practical end which all secret societies pro - tess. Temperance, Brotherly Kindness, Faith, Cour - age, Perseverance; all these are professed objects in Lhe various lodges of our time. If the lodges could really produce the virtues which they profess, they would be as truly religious as the Christian system, which has actually brought about these virtues of which the lodges lyingly boast. THE KNIGHTS T~MPLAR r~GREE These degrees, our remarks are especially suggested by the fifth of the Knights Templar degree, are pro - fessedly Christian. Ignorant men who know nothing about Christianity and very little about Templary, frequently declare that a faithful member of one of these Templar lodges must be a Christian man. Let us dwell for a moment upon the characteristics of these degrees; and in the first place we remark that their members are introduced in every case by a slave ‘s oath. With a painful iteration that would be ridicu - lous if it were not tragic, time after time, degree after degree, the candidate is sworn to obey. “I will keep secret,’’ ‘‘I will keep secret,’’ ‘‘I will keep secret,’’ ‘‘11 will obey,’’ ‘‘I will obey,’’ ‘‘I will obey.” It would be strange were it not for the fact that evil like good is progressive in character, to know that the assurance of the Master that the lodge oath is not to interfere with the duties of the lodge man is omitted in these higher, or lower, degrees. Hi the Blue Lodge the candidate has the assurance of the Master that nothing in the obVga~ tion which he is about to assume shall interfere with the exalted duties which he owes to himself, his family, his country or his God. There is no such statement made in Council or Commandery degrees, but time after time the candidate is simply sworn that he will conceal and that he will obey. Another characteristic of all these degrees is in the constant repetition of the signs of the degrees. These signs refer either to the destruction of life or the mutilation of the body. The sign of the Entered Ap - prentice degree is a motion that indicates the cutting of the throat; the sign of the Fellow Craft degree is a motion which indicates the tearing out of the heart; the sign of the Master Mason indicates the cutting i~ two oE the body; the sign of the Mark Master repre - sents the cutting off of the hand. The sign of the Past Master refers to the penalties of the first three"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE FIVE LIBATIONS. 27 26 LODGE 51GN5 A CONTINUOUS SCHOOL FOR MURDER. degrees, throat cutting, heart tearing out and cutting of the body in two. The sign of the most Excellent Master degree refers to the tearing open of the breast; the sign of the Royal Arch Mason refers to the cutting off of the top of the head. The penalty of the Royal Master is that a candidate be burned alive; of the Select Master that his eyes should be torn from their sockets, his hands chopped off and his body quartered. The penalty of the Superexcellent degree is that his thumbs should be cut off, his eyes put out and his body bound in chains of brass and c~rried away to a distant land. The penalty of the Knight of the Red Cross is that his house should be torn down, the tim - bers set up and he hanged thereon. The penalty of the Knight Templar degree is that his head should be smitten off and placed upon the highest spire of Christendom. There is a Satanic perseverance in the way in which these penalties, which call for murder, are constantly kept before the mind of the candidate. In all the Council and Commandery degrees in open - ing and closing, every one of the signs which refer to these mutilating or murderous penalties has to be given. Every time a man takes a new degree he gets a neW sign which reminds him that if he does not stay by the Order, he is likely to lose his life. There are probably twenty-five or thirty well known cases in which Masons have been murdered by their fellow lodge men for failing to maintain their secret society oaths: but instead of wondering at this, one who reads the Rituals and sees how degree after degree a man must not only give the sign which calls for the penalty of that degree, but the signs of the penalties of all the preceding degrees,—I say, when one thinks of this, he is astonished that the murders are not a hundred fold more frequent than they are. I remember well to have been asked at one time by a Knight Templar Mason what the trouble with Masonry was. He said that he tried to be a decent man, and he could not see what the objection to the lodge could be. I re - plied, well, there are many objections; one of them is that the lodge is a continuous education for mur - der. He said: “That is nonsense; there is not a word of truth in it.” I said, well, let rue ask you a ques - tion; do you think that a man could be in a Masonic lodge room once a week, and hear the oath admin - iste red and see the signs given, without coming to be - lieve that it would be right to kill a man who should break his Masonic oath? “Why,” he replied, “I think any man who breaks a Masonic oath ought to be killed.” Well, I said, then you have in yourself evi - dence for the truth of what I say; killingaman for breaking a Masonic oath in this country is murder, and you are ready for it now. The third characteristic of these degrces is that they are blasphemous. For example: To have drunken, profane, Godless men forming the Cherubim, which they do repeatedly in the Council of the Royal and Select Masters, is one instance. Then to have the same sort of men kneeling cn one knee, or on the other knee, or on both knees, and putting their hands on the Bible,—not tl~e Bible as a sacred book, but on the Bible with the square and compass. abov& it, three “articles of furniture” as they are called. Then to have men, such as we all know to be in the Councils of Royal ax~d Select Masters, and in the Commanderies of Knights Templar, repeating such words as these:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"r 28 YIELD PRIVATE JUDGMENT. “And behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be.” “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.’’ Words which seem perfectly appropriate in the mouth of our Lord and Savior, but horribly blasphemous in the mouths of men who in Councils and Commnanderies are repeating them. I heard a seceding Mason once say: “I have not gone so far in Masonry as some men have, but I went far enough to see a drunken, profane wretch sitting be - hind a burning bush saying, ‘I am the God of thy fathers,’ and that was far enough for me.” The way in xvhich the lodge in the Select Master’s degree speaks of the Word of God is another instance of the same sort; the name of God is spoken of as used among the Jews, as used among the fire worshipers, then as among the Trojans and Canaanites, then among the Egyptians, and one receives the impression that one of these words is about as good as another, that they all mean substantially the same thing, so that God or Baal may be used indifferently. In the Coin - mandery perhaps the most horrible instance of this kind is in the Chamber of Reflection, where a skull is placed on the Bible and where time five libations are taken: cue to the honor of Solomon, one to the honor of Hiram of Tyre, one to the honor of hiram the archi - tect, a fourth in honor of Simon the Cyrenian and the fifth is declared to be a testimony to belief in immor - tality of the soul and the candidate says: “As the sins of the whole world were lai4 upon the head of my Savior, so may the sins of him whose skull this was (speaking of the skull bowl out of which he drinks) be laid upon me in addition to my own, should I prove WILY ARE GOOD MEN IN LODGES? 29 untrue to this, my solemn obligation of a Knight Templar.” What a wretched mixup there is of truth and falsehood, and what a horrible thing for a human being,. a sinner who must be saved by the blood ol~ Jesus, or die eternally, to pray double damnation upon his soul in this fashion. FREE MASONRY AN ABSOLUTE CHRISTLESS DESPOTISM rphis is evident on every page of the Masonic Law. Low degrees and high degrees alike bear their testi - mony to this tremendous fact. General A. T. C. Pier - son says: “We may not call in question the pro - priety of this organization. If we would be i\\’Iasons we must yield private judgment; to the law and to the testimony, if any man walk not by this rule, it is because there is no light in him.’’ (Pierson’s Tracti - tions, page 30). Albert G. Mackey says in his Lexi - con article, ‘‘Master of the Lodge’’: ‘‘The power of the 1\\laster in his lodge is absolute.” He says again in an article ‘‘obedience”: ‘‘The Mason is obedient to the Master, the Master to the lodge and the lodge to the Grand Lodge.” Robert Morris, on page 195 of Webb’s Monitor, edition with the synopsis of Ma - sonic law, says: “The first duty of the reader of this synopsis of 1\\fasonic law is to obey the edicts of his Grand Lodge, right or wrong. His very existence as a i\\Iason hangs upon obedience to the powers un - mediately set above him. Failure in this must in - variably hring down expulsion, which as a Masonic death, ends all. The one unpardonable crime in a INIason is contumacy or disobedience.~, What is hone stated in plain terms is implied throughout the whole work of lodge, chapter, council and commnandery. There is no provision in the whole system for the exercise of conscience on the part of the Mason. Secrecy and obedience are declared to be the cardinal virtues of the Mason. He may be a drunkard and an adulterer, a thief, and be a worthy Mason. That is to say, he will not by the commission of any"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"30 FOLLOW CLIIIlST S COMMANDS, NOT TILE LODGE’S. of these offenses necessarily deprive himself of mem - bership in the Order, but he must obey, and if he does not obey, then he becomes a Masonic outcast. He must conceal the proceedings of his lodge, chapter, council or commandery from his wife, from his neighbors and friends who are not Masons, from his brethren in the Church, if he professes to be a Christian; and if he does this, keeps the secrets of the Order and obeys the commands, signs, summons and tokens sent to him, he then may be a good and satisfactory member of the Order. Is it possible to conceive of any Satanic institution more clearly and evidently devilish than this? MASONIC PREACHERS AND CHURCH MEMBERS We are continually asked how it is possible that Free Masonry should be such a system as a study of these degrees shows it to be, and that at the same time ministers, members and other officers of churches should be connected with the Order. It is undoubt - edly a great mystery, but it is not the only one. Any - one who reads the New Testament knows that Jesus would have his brethren clean, and yet all know that many of them are not so. How can professed Chris - tians accumulate money, •as they do. neglecting the cry of the suffering, and the needs of a thousand mil - lion heathen? How can professed Christians bribe legislators or judges, and how can professed Chris - tians who are judges or legislators, accept bribes, and do the unlawful things which many of them do? How was it possible for ministers, bishops and members of churches to own slaves, and buy them and sell them, and work them Without wages, and educate, clothe and feed their own children by selling slave children? How was it possible that professed Christian people should do such things as these? Everybody who knows the facts at all, knoxvs that they did just such things, and it is not any more difficult to understand how professed Christians should be lodge men, should 31 CHRIST’S EXAMPLE. consent to the shameful and degrading ceremonies, should incur heathenish obligations, and the murder - ous, devi]ish penalties of lodge, chapter, council and commandery, than it is to understand how they should do these other things which all men know they have done, some of which they are still doing. The fact is, God does not allow man to trust in man. He requires man to trust in Him. Jesus never told us to follow the example of pastors, elders, bishops or deacons: He told us to follow Him. If we fail to do this we fail to live Christian lives; and every reader, if he is a pro - fessing Christian, should seriously ask himself this question: “Am I leading the Christlike life? Am I speaking and acting as Jesus did?” If not, then so far as he fails of thus living, he fails of the Christian life, and if he is not in will and purpose devoted thus to live, he is not a Christian at all. “If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” I , r V IL"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Un — KNIGHT TEMPLARISM ILLUSTRATED.

HISTORY. ‘~ Thrice Illustrious Ma’~ter (to candidate)—My worthy companion, our Grand Masters, Solomon King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre and Hiram Abif, at an early peri - od in the construction of the Temple, resolved to reward all those craftsmen who should prove themselves worthy by their industry, skill and fidelity, by communicating to them the Master’s Word. This being agreed upon, it became necessary to agree at what time and under what circumstances the secrets of a Master Mason should be communicated to them. Several plans were proposed and discussed at the frequent meetings of our Grand Masters, but all were found objectionahie, so that their deliberations on this subject continued until the Temple was approaching its completion, when it was NoTE l7.—”The legend refers to a combinal ion among a few of the Temple. builders to extort by violence, from the principal conductor of the work, the ascrets of Speculative Masonry. “—Morris’ Dict., Art.

This l)lall was adopted and they bound themselves 1)y a sole inn obligation to a strict ob - servance of the same. When the sanet itin sa nctoru,n was nearly corn j)leted, King Solomon selected seven of the most expert, true and trusty workmen, from, a certain other selection, to fashion and construct all the holy vessels designed for use in the holy of holies. Hiram Abif and Adoniram were two of the seven, and while laboring together they entered into frequent conversations respecting the condition and prospects of the craft. Upon one of these collversatlons, which took place just before the death of our Grand M~tcr Hiram Abif, this degree was fouii d ed. After the s:uzctu,n 5~tnciou.en was completed, and a portion of the furniture placed therein, on a certain day near lugh twelve, Adonirarn repaired thither to deposit one of the holy v~s sels and when the craft were called from labor to refreshment, lie did not return with the rest of the craftsmen, but lingered behind with Hiram Abif. who3e custoln it was at high twelve to enter into the sanctum Sanctorum to offer up his ador— ations to Deity and draw his designs upon his trestle- board. After our Grand Master had fulfilled his usual custom he was met by Adonirarn near the south gate who inquired of him when be should receive the Mas - ter’s Wor(1.

The mercy seat was of solid gold, the thickness of an hands breadth; at the two ends ~vere two cherubim, looking inward toward each other, with their wings expanded; which, embracing the whole circumference of the mercy seat, they met on each side, in the middle; all of the Rabbins say it was made out of the same mass, ~vithout any soldering of parts. “Here the Shekinah, or Divine Presence, rested, and was visible in the appearance of a cloud over it.

They further foresaw that in the destruction of the Templa would also perish all those sacred treasures contained in the secret vault. To avert so dreadful a calamity, and to provide for the fu - tmre prosperity of the craft they agreed to erect a secret vault, 30 beginning at King Solomon’s most retired room, leading a due westerly course, and ending under the sanctum sanctorum, or holy of holies.

During the erection of this secret vault a circum - stance occurred which characterizes this degree and upon which the principal ceremonies are founded. 38 One of King Solomon’s particular friends and favorites, named Izabud, having been several times denied admis - sion to King Solomon’s most retired room, feared that he had lost the favor of the king, and for a long time grieved in silence, until at length, unable to endure it longer, he humbly mentioned his fears to King Solomon and received for answer “Be contented, my friend Izabud, the time will soon come when the door will be left open for your reception as heretofore.” This satis - fied him, but one evening, having some particular busi - ness with King Solomon; he retired to his most retired room in search of him.

Not finding you there and observing an open passage leading hither, I followed it in search of you. Far be it from me that either curi - osity or disobedience should have tempted me hither, but rather impute my intrusion to my fervency and zeal in your royal service.” Upon this our Grand Master Hiram, King of Tyre, observed, “Thrice Illustrious King Solomon, if this be true, Izabud is not guilty of the charge alleged against him. His intrusion was owing to an unguarded expres - sion of your own; he ought to be pardoned and admitted one of our select number.” King Solomon replied, “My illnstrious companion of Tyre, I acknowledge this to be true, but how can it be, since our select number is already full, and he ean not be admitted ?‘, At this Hiram Abif interposed and said, “Thrice Il - lustrious King Solomon, let Achishar, the Grand Stew - ard, be discharged and executed, for he is no longer worthy of our confidence; he has betrayed his trust and forfeited his life by falling asleep at his post. Let iza - bud be pardoned and admitted in his stead.” King Solomon thanked him for his good and timely counsel and ordered Achishar to be put to death in - stantly.

It was deposited in the year of the world three thousand, by Solomon King of Israel, Hiram King of Tyre, ar 1 d Hiram Abif, for the good of the craft in general and the Jewish nation in particular. After the completion of the secret vault and this deposit had been made in the ninth arch, but before the completion of the Temple, our Grand Master, Hi - ram Abif, was assassinated, as we have had an account in the Master Mason’s degree, and it was then sup - posed that the Master’s Word 35 was forever lost; but rote 34.—”The 5ubstitute Ark. The Ark or Coffer, which nceessarily constitutes a part of the paraphernalia of a Council of 5elect Masiers. is the same as that which forms a part of the furniture of a Chapter of Royal Arch. But It must bc distinctly understood that neither of these represents that Ark of the Covenant which had been consiructed in the wilderness by Moses, Aholiab and Bezaleel. which had been placed in the tabernacle, and afterward. at the dedication of the Temple of 5oiomon, was removed to the holy of holies.”—MlCkey’5 Ritualist, page 539. Note 35.—”The great object of all Masonic labor is divine truth. The search for the lost word is the search for truth. But divine truth is a term synonymous with God. The Ineffable Name is a symbol of truth, because God, and God alone, Is truth. It is properly a Scriptural idea. The Book of Psalms abounds with this sentiment. Thus it is said that the truth of the Lord ‘reacheth unto the clouds,’ and that ‘His truth end~ireth unto all generations.’ If. then. God is truth, and the 5tone of Foundation is the Masonic symbol of God, it follows that it must also be the symbol ~f divine truth.”—Mackey’s Ritualist, page 548."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"80 SELECT MASTER’S DEGREE. by a communication from Adoniram it was ascertained that Hiram Abif had expressed a wish that in case of his death the Master’s Word 36 should be deposited in the ninth arch, as we have seen represented in the Royal Master’s degree. The two surviving Grand Masters agreed to this and. accordingly placed upon the top of the ark in the center an equilateral triangle, on the three sides of which they placed the name of Deity in three languages, Syri ac, Chaldean and Egyptian. This last precaution was taken by our Grand Masters, so that in case the children of Israel should be held so long in captivity as to lose the use of the Hebrew tongue and forget the true pronunciation of the grand and sacred Name, yet by the use of the Syrian, Chal - dean and Egyptian languages in which the Grand Om - nific Word was inscribed, they might be able to pro - nounce the Master’s Word; and, that it might be known and distinguished if ever brought to light, they placed the three Grand Masters’ jewels on the same, one in each language, knowing that a description of these jewels would be handed down to the latest Masonic posterity. Thus was preserved and brought to light the long lost ancient Master’s Word or Great and Sacred Name. 37 Masonic tradition informs us that this Word was communicated by God himself to Moses at the Burning Bush, and was in use until the death of Hiram Abif, after which it lay buried in darkness for the space of four hundred and seventy years, until the building of the Second Temple when it was discovered a~id Note 36,—”The Masonic Stone of Foundation, So conspicuous In the degree of Select Master, is a symbol of divine truth. upon which all 5peculatlve Masonry is built: and the legends and traditions which refer to It are intended to describe In an allegorical way, the progress of truth In the soul, the search for which is a Mason’s labor; and the discovery of which is to be his reward.”—Maokey’s Ritualist, page 549.

MONITORIAL. “There may be an inquiry in your mind what was the nature of the word that rendered the Jews so anxious to keep possession; how came it in their pos - session, and of what importance was it to them—this part Solomon has allusion to when the Master’s Word was lost. “Zoraster (who flourished about 800 years before the building of the Temple) in the Zendavesta writes; ‘There are names given by God himself to every nation of unspeakable efficacy in the mysteries.’ Therefore, this word in the minds of the Jews was of unspeakable efficacy, preserving them as a nation and conferring upon them a mighty vower. We find the Trojans, 200 years before the building of the Temple, having pos - session of a Palladium which fell from heaven, and only by its loss could their city be destroyed. The Chal - deans wore triangular pieces of metal, sometimes stones, 88 on which were engraven certain characters called talismans, the possession of which they imag - ined gave them power over the spirits and mortals, Note 87.—”In the United States, the Royal Arch is considered as the seventh degree, those of Mark.

INITIATION. 83 The principal was named Bel or Baal. In confirmation we find the Jews saying to Christ, ‘You cast out devils by the aid of Beelzebub.’ The Hindoos Ilave a word of such tremendous efficacy that the simple utterance of the word by a holy Brahmin would shake the paradise of Swerga to its center, convulse the earth to its foun - dation, restore the dead to life, destroy the living, trans - port himself where he pleased, and fill him with the wisdom of the gods. This word is Aun or On, and belongs to the triad. The word On is Egyptian and was esteemed the most ancient of the gods, for Plato, who derived much infornlation from the Egyptians, writes, ‘Tell me of the god On, which was and is and never knew beginning.’ They ascribe the same powers to ‘On’ that the Jews did to Jehovah. But the affinity of certain words between Hindoos. Chaldeans and Egyptians is so close that we may presume they came from the same source. The Jews believed by the power of the name. It cured them of evils, warned them of danger, restored the dead to life, brought fire from heavcn, rent buildings asunder, maimed and destroyed their enemies, and filled them with great wisdom; the pronunciation shakes heaven and earth, and inspires the very angels with astonishment. The Rabbins call it ‘Shem Hamphorish,’ the unutterable name. That the word inspired the possessor with great wisdom, the sacred records testify in many instances. The first place where we find it in its proper name is in Samuel, wlio was inspired with so great wisdom as to be judge of the Jews. We find also, the word had the same power when communicated. Samuel gave the word to Saul, and the possession filled him with wisdom and understanding far above his compeers, and, in the alle - gorical language of the East, gave him another heart and so surprised those who knew him as to make them exclaim, ‘Is this Saul the son of Kish?’ But we find on the loss of the word he was grcatly troubled and en - deavored to regain it in various ways; at last sum - moned the spirit of Samuel to give it. Samuel gave the word to David, and the Lord was with David from that day forward, for he says expressly, ‘F6r thy word’s sake has tily servant known these great things.’ And we find David triumphing over all his enemies by the power vested in him. “Wben God refused David to build a temple to his name, Solomon, was appointed in his stcad, and tradi - tion states, that on commencing the foundation he struck on a cavcrn in which were immense treasures of gold, silver and precious stones. Believing it to be the rcmains of some temple built before the flood, and fear - ing that it had been in the service of idolatry, he was informed by a dream that this place had been thrice de - voted to God. It was the place whence Enoch was translated, where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and it was the place of the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite, where David met and appeased the destroying anget. rri~ treasures were collected and used in bnilding the Temple. On exploring the lowest recesses of the cavern they came upon an arched vault, in which they foulid a white marl)le pillar, on which, en - crusted with precious stones, was a delta, and on which was engraved the Grand Omnifie Word, the possession of which filled J~im with such wisdom and understand - ing that his name resounded throughout the earth, and has so continued to the present day. It was this that enabled our three Grand Masters to erect such a mag -"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"84 SELECT MASTERS DEGREE. nificent structure, the like of which has not been be - fore or since. “The Arabians have the tradition that the Word was engraved on a seal, and gave them power over the Dives, Afreets, Ghouls and other evil spirits, imprisoning them and confining them at the bottom of the sea by impressing on them the signet. By them it was cafled a talisman or conferrer of power. By the Egyptians they were worn as amulets or averters of danger, and are still worn at the present day. We now see by the in - spiration it gave its possessor what struck Solomon with such consternation and anxiety on the death of Hiram Abif. The key was probably a triangular plate on which was engraved the Omnific Name, this being worn constantly on the breast, would, by lying on it continually, give a faint impression of the Word; * * It was thea possession of the Word *** Having men - tioned that all nations possessed a word we will inquire how it first came in possession of the Jews. The Rab - binical tradition i~, that it was given by God to Adam, who, foreseeing the deluge, enjoined on the sons of Seth to preserve it for future generations, when ~he flood would have swept all but Noah’s family away. Enoch, the son of Seth, while deliberating upon the best means of preserving for future generations the Ineffable INamG of Deity, was favored by a mystical vision; he seemed be transported to the top of a high mountain. Qn up, he discovered in the heavens a triangular looking late brilliantly illuminated, on which appeared certain ystic characters which he receiyed a strict injunction never to pronounce; he then appeared to descend to the owels of the earth; looking beneath him he discovered the same triangle. Instructed by this vision he built INITIATION. 85 two pillars, on which was engraven the knowledge of the antediluvian world, and beneath he formed a cav - em, and in it he deposited the triangle on which was engraved the Ineffable Word. He left a key to the name, as tour Grand Masters have done, so those wllo had this key could pronounce the name. The Eastern nations have the tradition that the key left was com - posed of small squares joined together, called a Zuarga, which they consult at the present day, as to matters of health arid business. It is possible that the key to ihe Royal Arch Word is the Z~arga of the East. The Ineffable Name was pronounced once a year by the High-Priest, amid the clang of cymbals and sound of trumpets, at the Feast of Expiation. It was not law - ful to pronounce it at any other time. * * * * * After the loss of the Word, the Jews endeavored to find a substitute by an idol, called by the ilabbins a Teraphim. According to tradition it was constructed in this wise, and occasioned the Jews much trouble in after periods: A head of a child first born and dead born, was placed on a golden plate or~ whose rim was engraved mystic characteers. Under the tongue they placed a laminar of gold, on which was engraved char - ~eters and inscriptions of certain planets. After per - forming invocations before it, it was endowed with speeeh to foretell events. This is the idol that is so bitterly i nveighcd’ against by Isaiah, Jeremiah and Eze - kid. This is following after the abomination of the heathen instead of seeking the Word.

The change of name was to indicate that the justice, and not the gift of the Lord, imparted to him a scepter at the pleasure of the Babylonish monarch. “Nebuchadnezzar’s final and fatal siege of Jerusalem began on Friday, the 30th of December, in the 588th year before the Christian era, being the seventh year of Pharaoh Ilophra, King of Egypt. “The King of Judah besought the aid of Egypt against the Chaldeans. Pharaoh attempted to inter - pose, but the result was to no purpose, as the prophet had foretold. “Pharaoh’s demonstration only occasioned an inter - mission of the siege for a period of about one hundred days. The city yielded to the Chaldean power and to famine on Wednesday, the 13th of June. “Deducting from the 530 days since the forts were built around Jerusalem, the probable interval of 100 days, wherein Pharaoh diverted the attention of the Chaldeans, and we have the 430 days during which Ezekiel was called upon prophetically to bear the ini - quities of Israel and Judah. “Zedekiah, dreading the fury of the monarch to whom he owed his own elevation, had fled from the city, but was pursued by the Chaldeans and captured in the plains of Jericho, about eighteen miles ftom Jerusa - lem. in the region of Hamath, where Pharaoh Nechi had put in bonds the humiliated Jehoahaz, son of Josiah. “At this place Nebuchadnezzar now had his quarters and to him the troops conducted the captive Zedekiah: ‘And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to Babylon.’ Thus were verified what had seemed to be the contradictory prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. The former pre - dicting of Zedekiah: ‘Thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the King of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.’ And the latter announcing, ‘I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans, yet he shall not see it though he shall die there.’ “Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer of the Chal - dean army, presented himself at Jerusalem on Wednes - day, the 11th of the succeeding month, and on the following Sabbath, the 14th of July, he completed his cruel and profane ravage in plundering and burn ing, the Temple and city. “The history prepares us for the thrilling and sacred theme of the pious and wonderful rebuilding of the Lords house.

Like the “Holy Royal Arch degree” these Council degrees were established by wandering adventurers, though it is claimed that King Frederick II. of Prussia gave the authority for their establishment to three Deputy InspeQtors General. We quote the following brief history of the Council degrees from Mackey’s Masonic Ritualist: “Forty years ago there were very earnest discussions on the subject of the origin and jurisdiction of the degrees of Royal and Select Master. At that time there were three allthorities under whom those degrees were conferred in the lljnited States; first, under Grand Councils in some of the States; secondly, under Grand Chapters as in Maryland and Virginia; and thirdly, under the Supreme Council of the thirty-third degree of 4he Ancient and Accepted Rite, as in South Carolina. This diversity of authority was undoubtedly dependent on an uncertainty of origin. The degrees were here, but few knew whence they came, nor by whom they had been originally introduced. “But an attempt on the part of the Grand Chapter of Maryland, in the year 1826, ‘to assume jurisdiction"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"116 SUBLIME GRAND LODGE OF PERFECTION.

In February, 1827, a committee of most able and competent Companions made a report on this subject to the Grand Chapter of South Carolina, in which the history of the origin of these degrees is so fully discussed, that the valuable information it imparts had better be given in the very words of the report it - self: “‘The committee appointed at the last stated convo - cation of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter, in May last, to take into consideration and report upon the propriety and expediency of the ~J ifferent Grand Royal Arch Chapters of the several States respectively assuming jurisdiction and authority over the Royal and Select Master’s degrees, and to which committee were referred the proceedings of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Maryland upon the subject, respectfully ask leave to state that they have made extensive and careful inves - tigation into the subjects referred to their considera - tion, and they offer the following statement as the result of their inquiries: “‘They have ascertained that the respectable brothers and companions, Dr. F. Daleho, Dr. Isaac Auld, Dr. James Moultrie, Sr., and Moses C.

Tfhe above-named three respectable br~thren and companions are, and have steadily been, members and officers of the said body of Princes of Jerusalem; their evidence, therefore, must be conclusive upon these points. “‘Your committee are informed that the above- named Brother Myers, previously to his return to Eu - rope, while pursuing his mercantile concerns, resided some time in ~everal of the cities of Virginia and Mary - land, where he communicated a knowledge of the d& grees in question. “‘The committee further state that the Grand Offi - cers and the Sublime Council of Inspectors General have been, since 1783, steadily in the habit of confer - ring the degrees in question, under their authority, in the Southern and Western States.

He has also added in his own hand the following comment: “‘Brother Myers, shortly after this (February 20, 1788), resided some time in Norfolk, Richmond and Baltimore, previous to his removal to Europe, and he communicated a knowledge of these degrees to a num - ber of brethren in those cities. The original copy is still in my keeping; and agreeably to the obligations of the same, and the Grand Constitutions governing those degrees, viz.: Royal and Select Masters of 27, it is cor - rect and lawful to give them either to Sublime Masons, who have arrived to the Knights of the Ninth Arch (13th degree), or to companions of the Third Arch, Royal Arch Masons.’ “The Rcv. Frederick Daleho, who was at one time Grand Commander of the Southern Supreme Council, in the appendix to his ‘Masonic Orations,’ published in 1803, after giving a list of the regular degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, adds, that ‘most of the In- spectors are in possession of a number of detached de - grees given in different parts of the world, and which they generally commanicate, free of expense, to those brethren who are high enough to understand them. And among these ‘detached degrees,’ he mentions ‘Se~ lect Masons of 27;’ which is what we now call the Select Master. • “From these statements, then, we gather the fol1ow-~ ing results as to the history of the introduction of these degrees into the United States: “1. The degrees of Royal and Select Master were originally brought to this country by an Inspector General of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, in the year • 1783, deposited by him in the archives, and placed un - der the control of the Council of Princes of Jerusalem, which was organized in the city of Charleston, South • Carolina, in that year. “2. These degrees were at first conferred in Charles - ton, by the Council of Princes of Jerusalem, as ‘de - tached degrees,’ or what in more modern phrase would be called ‘side degrees’ of the Ancient and Accepted Rite. “3. They were disseminated over the whole country by agents or representatives of this Rite, who conferred them on any qualified persons whom they pleased to select, but always with the administration of a pledge of allegiance to tl}e Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Rite. “4. Charters were granted by these agents of the Supreme Council for the establishment of Councils of Royal and Select Masters, in different States, which Councils subsequently united in the formation of State Grand Councils, and threw off their allegiance to the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"120 BLASPHEMOUS USE OF ALPHA AND OMEGA. SILENCE AND SECRECY CARDINAL MASONIC VIRTIJES. 121 Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Rite. I do not believe that charters were ever granted imme - diately and directly by the Supreme Council. I think that they were always issued in its name by its agents, who were empowered so to do by a general warrant. Thus I have been enabled to trace the original Councils of Alabama to the action of John Barker, who was an authorized agent of the Supreme Council. Perhaps more work was done in this way by Jeremy L. Cross, under the same claim, than by any other man in the United States.”——Mackcii’s Ritualist, pages 606 to 611. From this brief sketch the reader will see that there was a fine exemplification of “those truly Masonic vir - tues, friendship, morality and brotherly love,” in the wrangle as to who should sell these Masonic secrets. The reader who has carefully noted the ritual of these degrees and the foot notes, particularly notes 3 and 6, and the prayer on same page as note 6; notes 8, 11,13, 22, 35, 36 and 38 and the charge to candidates, pages 110-111, will need no argument to convince him that theso degrees are but a development of the Masonic and Satanic plan of salvation wiThout Christ. The blasphemous use made of one of the chosen titles of the Lord Jesus, “Alpha and Omega,” as given on page 51 and the Masonic admission of such use in note 16 on same page, ought to make every true Christian loathe the institution, and the unblushing admission by Mack-’ ey in notes 14, 21, 22, 32 and 38, either of the aping of the ancient mysteries, or the actual identity of these degrees with those heathen orders -of which Paul says, “it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret,” (Eph. 5: 12) ought to open the eyes of any person whose mind is not completely blinded by the god of this world (see 2 Cor. 4:4) to the abominable character of this professedly “ancient and honorable institution.” In regard to the design and teaching of these de - grees; the “Masonic symbolism,” it is doubtless true that many who read the ridiculous story about the nine arches under Solomon’s Temple, one of which, the ninth and last, which is pretended was directly under the sanctum sanctorum, or holy of holies, and was made alone and entirely by the three Grand Masters, Solo - mon, King of Israel; Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram, Abif, with their own hands, will be simply amused thereby as they would be by some newspaper story about a great sea serpent. As to the puerile and ludi - crous story about Izabud, the “particular friend” of Solomon, and A~hishar, the unfaithful steward or sen - tinel, whose pretended condemnation and execution are • the basis of the degree, many will see only a meaning - less farce. That such a conclusion would be very errone - ous is evident from the following: “The two virtues which it is particularly the sym - bolic design of the Select Master’s degree to inculcate are secrecy and silence. They are, indeed, called the cardinal virtues of a Select Master, because the neces - sity of their practice is prominently set before the can - didate in the legend, as well as in all the ceremonies of the degree. Bu~t these virtues constitute the very es - sence of all Masonic character; they are the safeguards of the institution, giving to it all its security and per - petuity, and are enforced by frequent admonitions in all • the degrees, from the lowest to the highest. The En - tered Apprentice begins his Masonic career by learning the duty .4of seerecy and silence. Hence it is appropri -"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"122 ALL FALSE RELIGIONS TEACh SILENCE AND SECRECY. THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST VS. FREEMASONRY. 123 ate that in that degree which is the consummation of initiation, in which the whole cycle of Masonic science is completed, the abstruse machinery of symbolism should be employed to impress the same important vir - tues on the mind of the neophyte. “The same principles of secrecy and silence existcd in all the ancient mysteries and systems of worship. When Aristotle was asked what thing appeared to him to be most difficult of performance, he replied, ‘To be secret and silent.’ “‘If we turn our eyes back to antiquity,’ says Cal - eott, ‘we shall find ‘that the old Eygptians had so great a regard for silence and secrecy in the mysteries of their religion that they set up the god Harpoerates, to whom they paid peculiar honor and veneration; who was rep - resenied with the right hand placed nejir the heart, and the left down by his side, covered with a skin before, full of eyes and ears; to signify that of many things to be seen and heard few are to be published.’ “Apuleius, who was an initiate in the mysteries of Isis, says: “By no peril will I ever be compelled to dis - close to the uninitiated the things that I have had in- trusted to me on condition of silence.’ “Lobeek, in his ‘Aglaophamus,’ has collected several examples of the reluctance with which the ancients ap - proached a mystical subject, and the manner in which they shrunk from divulging, any explanation or fable which had been related to them at the mysteries under the seal or secrecy and silence. “And lastly, in the school of Pythagoras these lessons were taught by the sage to llis diciples. A novitiate of five years was imposed upon each pupil, whiell period was to be passed in total silence and religious and philo - sophical contemplation. And at length, when he was admitted to full fellowship in the society, an oath of secrecy was administered to him on the sacred tetractys, which was equivalent to the Jewish tetragrammaton. “Select Masters therefore work in secrecy and silence, that they may prepare and preserve the sacred deposits of truth until the time shall come for its full revelation. And so should all men do, working now, vet not for the prese]lt time alone, but that their labor may bring foith fruit in the future; laboring here amid the foundations of the first temple of this transient life, that when their hours of work are finished 01] earth, the deeds which .1 tney have done may be brougilt to light, and the re - ward be bestowed in the second temple of eternal life. • “Tills is the true syml)oliSm of the Select Master’s degree.”—lVtackey’s J?ituaiist, paqes 523-525. Such is the character of the Council degrees and of Freemasonry as stated by Dr. Albert G. Mackey, the most prolific writer and generally regarded as the high - est Masonic authority in America, and now and for years past a “Sovereign Grand Inspector General” of the order. While the Christian religion always and • everywhere brings peace and good will to men, and Christ said, “I ever spake openly to the world * * and in secret have I said nothing,” (John 18: 20) “What ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the house tops,” (Matt. 10: 27) the Masonic, like all ~a1se religions, of each of whom Satan is the real god, governs its vota - ries by terror; and, instead of, “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature,” secrecy and silence are pronounced “tile cardinal virtues.” The teaching and design of the Super-Excellent Mas - ter’s degree (last of the Council degrees) is stated by the sanle author still more forcibly and concisely as quoted in note 44, the closing clause of which has an unmistakable ring: “\\Vhose object is to warn tile recipi - en t [of the degree] of the fatal effects that will ensue from a violation of ilis sacred obligations.”"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"DIAGRAM OP RED Cnoss CouNciL. 124 Master of Finances.

Sovereign Master—Zerubbabel, 73 we will now licar the reasons for your opinion and the important addi - tion you have made. ‘~THE POWER OF WOMEN AND TRUTH. “0 princes and rulers, the force of wine is not to be denied; neither is that of kings, that unites so many men in one common bond of allegiance; but the su - premacy of woman is vet above all this; for kings ~re but the gifts of women, and they are also the mothers of those that cultivate our vineyards. Women have the power to make us abandon our very country and relations, and many times to forget the best friends we have in the world, and, forsaking all other comforts, to live and die with them. But when all is said, neither they, nor wine, nor kings, are comparable to the al - mighty force of TRUTH. As for all other things, they are mortal and transient, but Truth alone is unchange - able and everlasting; the benefits we receive from it are subject to no variations or vicissitudes of time and fortune. In her judgment is no unrighteousness, and she is the strength, wisdom, power and majesty of all ages. Blessed be the God of Truth.”—.—Simons’ Book of the Commandery, page 1(5.

Candidate—Zerubbabel, the Council with great joy accepts your noble and generous offer and will imme - diately invest you with the necessary passwords which will enable you to make ypurself known to the friends of our cause wherever you may meet them and insure to you their friendship and protection; but before entering upon an undertaking ot such vast importance it is necessary that you take upon yourself a solemn obligation to be faithful to the trust reposed in you. 21 arm you with this sword to enable you to defend LECTURE. • yourself againsf your enemies.

Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying u:ito him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? And he said, Go into the city to such a man and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

The most eminent Warriors and noblemen of Europe entered its ranks. The Knights of the Temple became the bulwark of the Holy Land against the Saracens. France, England and other countries formed associations (Priories) of Templar Knighis, each with its own Grand Master and other officers. Such great wealth was accumulated in the treasuries of the order that In the year 1185 its annpal income represented a sum equal to thirty millions of dollars. But wealth and prosperity naturally ied to licen - tiousness, neglect of Templar law and in Ihe end destruction. In the year 1307, the Grand Master of the order, Jaques de Molay, was ariested at Paris with sixty of his knights and imprisoned upon ehargcs of idolatry and other crimes. 5hortly afterward all the Knights Templar in France were put in prison at Paris.

Candidate—The sealed libation. Eminent Commander Why so?

On the 15th of December, 1442, after a tranquil occupation of this island for more than two hundred years, they were finally ejected from all their possessions by the Sultan Soliman the Second. After this disaster they successively retired to Castro, Messina and Rome, until the Emperor Charles v., in 15~O, bestowed upon them the island of Malta, upon the condition of their defending it from the depredations of the Turks, and the corsairs of Barbary, and of lestoring it to Naples, should they ever succeed in recovering Rhodes.

After the suppression of the erder of Knights Tem - plar by the Council of Vienne in 1312, a considerable portion of their assets were conferred upon the Knights of St. John, with which order they were, by a general decree in the papacy of Clement V., ailnexed and in - corl)orated. This decree was not generally submitted to. The Templars and the Knights of St. John were formerly rival orders, between whom there had long existed a spirit of jealousy, which on various occasions led to the deadliest animosity. The recollection of these events had kindled a fire in the bosoms of a portion of the Templars which the most dreadful misfortunes could not extinguish. Those Templars who could not reconcile themselves to the union of the two orders continued to maintain a distinct organization. The Grand Master Molay in anticipation of his own fate, had appointed 184 by charter of transmission John Mark Larmienus of Jerusalem as successor. Under this charter the Grand Chapter of France has from that time to the present continued to practice the an - cient rites of the order. Dennys, Prince of Portugal, adverse to the destruction of an order, a branch of which lie had taken under his protection, adroitly avoided the fate which threatened it by the nominal fiction of converting its title into that of the Order of Christ, ‘~h supremacy of which he declared thenceforth to be vested in the crown.

I INITIATION. 271 Under this title the Templars in Portugal have con - tinued to flourish undisturbed to the present day. The l)apal persecution had reached every state in Eu - rope and scattered the members of the order through - out Christendom. Some became errant while others connected themselves with the Teutonic and other or - ders of knighthood and others again formed independ - ent Chapters, and by avoiding the political questions of the day were enabled quietly to hold their meetings. The Templars connected themselves with the Knights of St. John under the following circumstances: After the Christians had been driven out of’ Palestine in 1291, those Templars who had been engaged in the holy wars, repaired to Cyprus and settled in Limasol. There they remained until 1306, when the Grand Master Molay and his principal officers were treacherously summoned to France by Clement V., the unworthy instrument of Philip the Fair. On their arrival they were immedi - ately thrown into prison. The Templars remained at Limasol justly apprehensive of the result of the unjust and cruel proceedings which had been instituted against the Grand Master and his companions, and foreseeing the probable destruction of the order established them - selves in 1310 at the island of Rhodes then under the Grand Master of the Knights of St. John. This was the first cPrect approach to that union of the two orders which was subsequently firmly decreed by Clement, arid henceforth the 6rders so united were known as the Knights of Rhodes until 1512, when the island fell into the hands of the Turks.

At this time they took the name of Knights of Malta, or the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. At that period it was the only one of the military or - ders of Palestine that continued to be recognized by the sovereign powers of Europe. About this period its ramifications extended throughout all Christendom and it maintained General Priories on the Continent and England. These, added to its immense possessions and wealth, were to its members great and desirab 1 e Pa” - sonal advantages and enabled the order to exercise a more extensive and powerful influence in all public affairs than was at that time enjoyed by any other class or association of men. With a view to protect themselves from imposition and that the members of the deceased order of knight - hood and the recent members of their own order, should not improperly avail themselves of the privileges and credit which their valor and perseverance had ivon for them, they instituted the order of Knights of Malta, The order continued in possession of the island of Malta until 1798, when it was betrayed by some French Knights into the hands of Bonaparte, after which the station of the order was established at Catania in Sicily, where it remained until 1826, when the Pope permitted the Chapter and the government to remove to France.

The thoughtful reader will continually compare the notes which are found in this volume with the Ritual published above it. It is frequently said by lodge men that one who is not a member of an Order cannot have any knowledge as to what the secret work really is, but everyone who reads the exposition of the lodge ceremonies here given and the extracts from Masonic “Books of the Chapter or of the Commandery, Lexi - cons and Texts on Masonic Jurisprudence’’will at once perceive how each fits into the other. It would not be at all difficult for one to trace the whole course of K initiation from Entered Apprentice to Knights of Malta, by the monitorial work to which reference has been made. The practical conclusion to be derived from this fact is that one may know the ceremonies of the Council and Commandery as fully without ever ‘~niting with the Masonic Order, as he can if he pays his money and submits to the degradation of initia - tion. This fact has become so well known to intelli - gent lodge men, that those of them who are fairly truthful have ceased to affirm that non-masons can - not know Masonry. I speak personally with lodge men every few months assuming the truth of revelations as made in this and other books, and I find that these gentlemen admit the truth of the Ritual as herein re - vealed, and Qndertake to justify the Order, if at all, on the basis of the facts as stated. If the reader, in conversation with i\\lasters or Knights should find them denying the subtantial truth of the revelation herein contained, he may rest assured that they are either not members of the Order at all, or are lying to him. Of coarse there are clandestine Masonic bodies. These may, and possibly do, modify the ceremonies, oaths and penalties in conferring the degrees. Then, too, there are regular Masonic bodies which for the sake of secQring members who will not submit to the humiliation of regular initiations, omit portions of the Ritual. Then there are tlw Masons made at sight, that is men who, because of their standing, are admitted as lodge men without any ceremonies at all. But all Royal, Select and Super- excellent Masters and Knights of the Red Cross, Knights Templar and Knights of Malta, who have been in real Masonic bodies, regQlarly admitted to these degrees, have passed through the ceremonies, have taken the obligations and are subject to the penalties herein set forth. PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES OF KNIGHTS TEMPLAR All who have stQdied the lodge qQestion understand that in addition to the secret work of the Order, there are also public occasions, which in one way and an - other reveal the character and tendencies of the insti - tution. The most prominent of the open gatherings of the Knights Temprar are what they call their “Con - claves.” Every three years, in some large city, there have been held, for many years, these gatherings. Re - specting them, two or three things might be said. First: They usually involve a nation wide contempt and profanation of the Sabbath. Great trains having hundreds of these Knights, so-called, are made up, Fri -"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"284 KNIGHT TEMP LABS BREAK THE LORD’S DAY. TRIENNIAL CONCLAVES ATTRACT LOOSE WOMEN. 285 day, Saturday or Sabbath, and for hundreds of miles go thundering over the broken law of God. If it be said that many professed Christians also ride on such trains, we must sorrowfully admit the truth of the statement; but it is not true that Christians as indi - viduals, or organizations, make up great trains to con - vey large numbers of persons for hundreds or thou - sands of miles on the Sabbath Day; and, while we must admit that the treatment which professed Chris - tians give to the Sabbath Day is very far from what it should be, we can affirm without doubt or hesitation that the Church is innocent of this wholesale Sabbath desecration, which the lodges of our country are now practising. The second characteristic of these conclaves of Knights Templar is the terrible amount of drunken - ness which is associated with them. It is credibly re - ported that on several occasions the Knights Templar from the Pacific Cc~st, when starting for a conclave, have brought with them wine, not by the barrel or case, but by the carload, and at times the camping grounds of the Knights has been so cluttered with• wine bottles during the night’s drinking, that they have been carried away by the wagon load in the morning. The vices of Sabbath breaking and drunkenness are intimately associated. Drunkenness leads to Sabbath breaking and Sabbath breaking conducts to drunken - ness. The saloon system in our country from ocean to ocean wars against the Sabbath Day. In every great city the saloons not only sell liquor during the days and hours which they are permitted to sell, but t they also sell at night and on the Sabbath Day, wh~en by law they are supposed to be closed. The reason for mentioning this characteristic of the Knights is the fact that they profess to be Christians; Templar making this profession, their national contribution to • this universal demoralizing trade calls for sterner condemnation. The third characteristic of these great lodge as - semblies is the fact that houses of ill-repute are so largely patronized by these Knights, who have sworn to draw their swords in defense of innocent maidens, destitute widows, suffering orphans and the Christian religion. No doubt there are differences in different conclaves, but the testimony of those who have been conversant with a number of these conclaves held in our own country, is that the disreputable houses of the city are fairly crowded with these men, many of whom do not even take the trouble to remove their uniforms. Deacon Philo Carpenter of Chicago said many years ago that the condQctors of the Burlington line said to him that the mi~eeting of the Grand Lodge of Illinois was attended by women of loose character from all parts of the State, as regularily as by the representa - tives of the lodges themselves. To the thoughtful stu - dent the explanation of this dark and loathsome fact is not far to seek. The Bible speaks continually of idolatry as adultery. The rightfQl relation of the hu - man soul to God is continually referred to in the Bible as marriage. God calls himself the husband of th believer, and believers who turn away to false gods are said to have broken their covenant with Jehovah. It is one of the world wide facts in connection with re - ligions that false religions assail the home as directly as they do the Church. Among the Mormons and Mo - hammedans, in China and Japan, there is nothing that corresponds to Chrjstian marriage. The reason is that the religions of these countries are not Christian. Not being Christian, how can there be Christian institri - tions? A gentleman who had withdrawn from the Masonic Order said that he did so because he fouiid himself be - coming, in his thoughts, disloyal to his wife. He said"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"U ‘A 286 DI5REGARD OF GOD’S COMMANDS. that he was horrified at the thoughts and feelings which were arising in his heart; that he talked the sub - ject over plainly with his wife, and, that they both agreed that it was association with the Masonic lodge which was s~parating them. He abandoned the Order and his home remained pure and happy. He did not understand the reason, but all who know that false re - ligions naturally tend to disrupt homes can under - stand what he simply felt. FRIENDS DO HIS COMMANDMENTS This principle our Lord lays down as fundamental in His kingdom. His friends are those who do His commandments. Masons who have understood that Christ is excluded from the first seven degrees of Masonry, have sometimes been quite pleased to find that in the Commandery His name occurs; that long passages of Scripture which deal with His life, death and resurrection, are read, and that prayers are of - ferc(I to God through Him. They apparently forget that the only way into this place where, as they sup - pose, Christ is honored, is through the long lodge road where He is ignored; but they should understand, even from the Ritual of the Co.uncil and Commandery, that Knights Templar Masonry is no more Christian than that of Blue Lodge or Chapter. “Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever II command you.’’ ‘‘Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” One can scarcely understand the stupidity which would lead one to sup - pose that a man or an organization could be acceptable to Christ because it pronounces His name, if it does not at the same time obey His commands. Is it not rather adding insult to injury to be mouthing the name and reading about the life of Jesus Christ while living in disobedience of His Commands and disre - gard of His eKample? It would be laughable, if it TEMFLKRISM TENDS TO DESTROY MARRIAGE. 287 were not tragic, to see men marching along the streets smoking cigars and rushing into liquor shops, using profane language, etc., and at the same time wearing the cross of Jesus on their gloves, on their hats or caps, on swords, and other articles of clothing. How all hell must ring with laughter when such men kneel, clasp hands and together repeat the Lord’s prayer, and then rise to go on with their profane and wicked living! One of my choicest friends, a man who was a Knight Templar, a Knight of Pythias and an Odd Fellow, and I think connected with one or two other lodges, told me that when he was in the lodges he was committing every sin he knew about excepting murder; yet he was an acceptable member of the organizations, and was a district deputy grand master for one of them. He said that after he was converted, when he was on his knees in the chapter, the men on each side of him were the same sort of persons that he had been. Prior to that time he said that he had never thought that it was wrong for such men as he had been, and they were, to kneel down and repeat prayers, but having himself become a Christian, he said it seemed unspeak. ably horrible for him to be kneeling there between two men of immoral and wicked lives, repeating together the Lord’s Prayer. He was so affected by the thought that he promised God if He would allow him to live to get away from the meeting he would never associate with these men iii that way again, lie burned his Knights Templar ‘s uniform in the stove, he put his sword handle into the stove and burned off all that would burn, he took the blade and buried it in his back yard in the ground.

IGNORE5 REGENERATION BY REPENTANCE AND FAITH.28~, life of sin which he had lived when a lodge man. NO REPENTANCE, NO CONFESSION, NO FAITH Our Lord clearly declares that the entrance into the kingdom is through repentance and faith. If the reader will turn to the Ritual as found in this book, he will see that there is no mention of repentance any - where. There is no call for confession of sin. Before the tabernacle as a worshipper approached he passed the altar of burnt offering, then the layer; then he passed into the holy place where he found on his left hand light and on his right hand bread, and before him the altar of incense. This is a clear revelation of the method in which men are saved. First, there must be the sacrifice for sin perceived and accepted. In this sin must be realized in some measure and acknowl - edged. This is repentance and confession, and then it is possible that the blood of Jesus should purge the sinner, repentant and acknowledging his fault. After pardon comes cleansing. The Holy Spirit cannot cleanse an unrepentant, unforgiven sinner. Such a person is not in a condition td be cleansed. He is pol - luted, unholy. After a sinner has been pardoned and washed, light will benefit him, food will sustain him and it will be possible for him to offer praise to God. Now, Knight Templarism, like all other Pagan religions, totally ignores the entrance into the Divine life. Men are taught to pray, to repeat the name of the Savior, even to speak of him as their Savior, with - out repentance or confession of sin. There is no such method of getting into the kingdom of God. Such a system shuts one up to the old folly of attempting sal - vation by works. This is the natural effort of the human heart, but it has never resulted in anything but failure; from the nature of the case it never can result in anything else. It can make hypoci:ites, but it cannot make Christians. It can make men profess to be good, but it cannot make them good. The reader ought to clearly comprehend this fundamental teach - ing of the Word of God. That we must obey or we are not friends of Jesus. We must obey or fail. And the first command is to repent and believe I-us Gospel. We concluded this chapter by urging the reader to carefully consider again the scriptures which are read, and the lectures which are given in these last three de - grees. How unspeakably horrible to think that even decent men repeat these words, unless they are sincere and humble believers in Jesus Christ, but when these Knights, so-called, are as a rule not even professing Christians, but men of the world, and very largely men whose habits do not commend them even as men, to think of such persons repeating such words, and again and again kneeling down to pretend to pray, is unspeakably horrible. After the conclave which was held in Chicago years ago, a number of the newspapers spoke of the charac - ter of the gathering. I subjoin a few of the editorials which were written at that time. NEWSPAPERS ON CONCLAVES “To say that the subscribing merchants of the city are indignant over the manner in which the, affairs of the Conclave have been conducted, is mildly to state a fact. Indignation is so strongly expressed that it amounts to a manifestation of positive anger and re - sentment. Many of them stigmatize .the affair as an I"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"290 NEWS PAPER5 ON THE CONCtAVE. 291 FROM THE INTER OCEAN AND THE TIMES. outrage, and while they are not willing to directly im - peach any responsible person, do not hesitate to de - claim against management so bad as to be culpable. The great majority of the unfortunate Knights them - selves concur in this expression, believing that in one way or another they have met with extremely bad treatment during the three days they have been in Chicago. One irate merchant declared that he would not have gone to the trouble of decorating his build - ings had he not supposed that he was to add thereby some grace to the magnificence of the procession. To get the emphatic idea of one of these gentlemen re - specting the affair, the hardy explorer had better approach with some words of praise touching the con - duct of the conclave. “—Chicago Inter Ocean, Aug. 20. Speaking of the enormous amount of liquors sold to the Knights, the Tribune of August 22 says: ‘‘One large establishment of Monroe street sold an average of over $1,000 in one day, for four days, over the counter, and $1,500 in one day in the wholesale de - partment to Templars.’’ This house is Chapin & Gore’s. We are assured by a leading business man and a Mason that Vincent Lumbard Hurlbut, the Most Eminent Grand Commander of the order, spent a large amount of time at this place. The Tribune concludes as follows: “In fine, it is shown that an enormous amount of Crusader beverage was gold in Chicago during the week just past. One prominent dealer estimated that a round mfllicn of dollars would not cover the amount spent for this alone. In this connection it is well to ‘observe that the humorous order issued by the tri - ennial authorities forbidding Knights to appear in places where T. L. was sold in their uniform, was taken in its exact spirit, and that every good Templar wore as much of his regalia as he could comfortably carry while making the rounds, particularly on the day of the procession.” The Chicago Times of August 20 voiced public opinion in the following forcible style: “There has not been from the beginning to the end of the series of conclave entertainments a single un - qualified success. Failure, extortion, blundering, swindling have been the main features of everything which has taken place of an official nature and which had been arranged in advance. The grand parade was at once a partial failure and complete swindle on those portions of the city which have done the most to give the conclave a financial foundation. The ex - position affair was a confidence game, pure and simple. It was not simply a confidence game, but it was a most disgraceful one—one in which there is not a single palliative feature. The competitive drill was still another operation which is a disgrace to every man who had anything to do with it in an official capacity. It was a swindle in that it asked com - manderies to compete in one way and then at a later day forced them to compete in another way, and one fbr which they had not the time the prepare them - selves. It was a most disgraceful affair in that there was no provision for water whereby visitors were obliged to pay for something to quench their thirst. It was still further a gross, inexcusable swindle in the fact that people who held tickets were bulldozed at the gates, and, to the number of thousands were"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"‘292 TILE RELIGIOUS PRESs.

There is no use in parading all the details of this affair, and inviting attention to those which are in the nature of complete or partial failures. It is much more easy to state the humiliating fact that not one of the l)romises of the triennial committee has been fulfilled.’’ Though the secular press spoke out thus boldly when backed by public opinion, some of the religious press analyzed the character of the order still more clearly: ‘‘The Teruplars came here without any ol.,ject coin - mensu rate with the time, trouble and expense of com - ing; they l)rouglit a great deal of money with them and left it here, largely in the saloons and theaters; they departe(i as they caine, wearing their little caps with little crosses, and carr~vmg their toy s~vords, leav - ing nobody here any wiser, any better, any happier for their visit. We asked several Masons, not Temp - lars, what the object of the conclave was; none could tell. There did not seem to ho any object save to make a grand display and to enjoy the hospitality of the city and a few days of revelry. Corning into the city one night on an Illinois Central train, the writer of this was enabled to look into the back doors of sev - eral of their tents pitched on the lake shore. The train was delayed along by the encampment for a long time, and ample opportunity was afforded f6r observation. The chief ol.jects in all the tents seen were bottles of beer an(l brandy and wines, with jugs on jugs of ‘‘sour mash.’’ The s6le employment of the Christian Knights was found in surrounding the con- tents of the above-mentioned furniture, and in singing ribald songs. Now be it remembered that this is a religious order: they march under the sign of the cross and claim to do battle for the right. “—The Christian Instructor, Aug. 26. “What mean these emblems? There is the red cross upon every uniform. That is intended to signify a soldier of the cross. Everywhere also is the cross with the legend, “in hoc signo vinces,” “by this sign conquer.” Symbols and mottoes abound in lavish pro - fusion, which speak of faith and hope and love. All point to the cross of Christ, and one would conclude from the outward signs that this order was devoted heart and soi~il to the maintenance of true religion. This would be all very well if those who flaunted them were real soldiers of Jesus Christ. Some are, but the majority are utterly indifferent. Some are infidels, some are licentious, some are tipplers, many are pro - fane. The Knightly uniform was seen crowding the theaters, the ballroom and the saloons. All those places were covered with religious emblems. As we write we see the Knights crowding thickly a saloon across the street, and soldiers wearing the cross of the suffering Savior are standing at the bar drinking, swearing, honoring Satan rather than Christ. “The enemies of the cross of Christ” by thousands are wear - ing a badge that proclaims them the soldiers of the cross! “What is the effect? It brings Christ and his suffer - ing and his religion itself into contempt. All empty forms in the name of religion are blasphemous. Such empty, unmeaning, childish profession is calculated to II"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"294 ITS PROFESSIONS, BAITS, LURES AND SNARES. lead the Templar himself, as well as others, to dis - trust all the professions of religion. “—The Evangelist, Aug. 26. “Such horrible incongruities as are seen in the dis. play of the emblem of the cross over saloons and bagnios were never seen before in this country. ‘Be faithful unto death’ appears amid crosses and crowns over one of the most prosperous gin mills in the city. What a ghastly travesty that is! There is a jeer and a sneer in it that could only be equaled by the devil reading the sermon on the mount to a convocation of Belials and Molochs and Beelzebubs. ‘For God, Man and Brotherhood’ is the motto of another degrader of public morals. ‘For God and the Right,’ says still another corrupter of public virtues. We are told that a bagnio, with hideous levity, is spangled over with crosses and sacred mottoes. All this to some is a roaring farce—to some of the hundred thousand strangers in the city—more or less—they are baits and lures and snares. To all pure minds it is appalling blasphemy. “—The Interior, Aug. 19. If secular newspapers and Christian newspapers found this meeting to be as is described above, we ask once more, how unspeakably horrible that men capable of such things should be mouthing the Scriptures and repeating the prayers which are recorded in this book. ARE YOU A KNIGI-IT TEMPLAR? If so, I take a moment to make a personal appeal to you. I well understand how men become entangled in secret societies. They are usually ignorant of their character. All they know is that some friends are connected with them and that they have been told that if they should join they might secure certain advantages of one kind and another. The introduction is generally a loathsome, disenchanting service. Most men of good character are surprised and indignant at COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM. 295 what they experience. In various ways they are urged to go forward and finally do so. Each degree is a step into the bog and each degree is an occasion for promises on the part of the lodge men that the future will show better things, and so men go on until some of them talie the Templar degrees. Those of them who have read this book know that the facts stated in it are substantially true; that the ceremonies and obligations and lectures are substantially as herein recorded. It is to be hoped that by this time they are satisfied that the whole system is not from above, but from below, and that they ought at once to sever their connection with such an organization. There are tens of thousands of lodge men in this country at this hour who are in exactly this condition: they know they ought to abandon the organization. To do so requires humility, faith and an indomitable courage. The fear of what lodge men may do to one’s business, to one ‘s reputation, even to one ‘s life keeps thousands ofmen in a perpetual slavery. Let every such brother, as he reads these words, remember that Jesus himself has said: ‘‘He that will save his life shall lose it,’’ but he that will sacrifice his life for the honor of Jesus shall heep it unto life eternal."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"TAKING ENTERED APPRENTICE OBLiGATION.
