It is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason. More ancient than the Golden Fleece or the Roman Eagle, more honorable than the Star or Garter, or any distinction that can be conferred upon you, at this or any future period, by king, prince, potentate, or any othes peison, and which is is hoped that you will wear with pleasure to yourself and honor to the Fraternity. THE TWENTY-FOUR INCH GAUGE is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to measure and lay out theii work. But we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It, being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematic of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we ale taught to divide into three parts, wheieby we find a part for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother, a part for our usual vocations; and a part for refreshment and repose. FIRST DEGREE. THE COMMON GAVEL is an instrument used by operative Masons to break off the rough and superfluous parts of stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use. But we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life; thereby fitting our minds as living stones for that spiritual build - ing, that house not made with hands, ciernal in the heavens. THE BADGE OF A MASON. The Lamb, in all ages, has been deemed an emblem of innocence.

In the third section we receive instruction relative to the Form. Suports, Covering, Furniture. Ornaments, Lights, and Jewels of a Lodge, how it is situated, and to whom dedicated The explanation of these is to be found in the Monitor which has been adopted by the fraternity as a text book, and with which isis hoped that you will soon make yourself familiar A Lodge is a certain number of brethren duly assembled, with a Holy Bible, a Square and Com - pass, and a Charter or Dispensation authorizing them to meet A Charter is an instrument emanating from a Grand Lodge, and, in this Jurisdiction, signed by the Grand Master and Grand Secretary, authorizing certain brethern therein named, when duly as - sembled, to Initiate, Pass, and Raise all good men and true who may apply for the purpose and whom the~~ ma~ find worthy A Dispensation is a like instrument, issued by the Grand Master during the recess of the Grand Lodge, which for a limited period, confers similar powers Our ancient brethren assembled on the highest hills and in the lowest vales, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers The Form of a Lodge is oblong It extends Irom East to West and ftom North to South, 6 PIRST DEGREE. and it is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Masonry and to teach us that a MasOn’s charity should be equally ex - tensive; for in every country and in every clime ate Masons to be found. A Lodge is metaphorically said to be sup pof ted by three gteat pillars, denominated Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty; it being necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertalti ngs. These pillats are represented in the Lodge by the Worshipful Master, the Senior and Junior Wardens. The Coverang of a Lodge is no less than the clouded canopy or star-decked heaven where all good Masons hope at last to arrive by aid of that theological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw, reaching horn earth to heaven, the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity, which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity for all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity; for our Faith may be lost in sight, Hope ends in fru - ition, but Charity extends beyond the grave. through the boundless realm of eternity. Every regular Lodge is fufnushed with a Holy Bible, Square, and Compass. 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I www.stichtingargus .nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www,stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl ww’vv. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus. ni www.stichtingargus.n I www.StichtingarguS.n I www. stichtingargus . n I www.stichtingargus. ni wwwstichtingargus.nI I FIRST DEGREE. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God, it being His inestimable gift to man as the rule and guide of his faith, • ; the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compass to the Craft, for, by due attention to its use, we are taught to circumscribe our desires and keep our passions within due bounds toward all mankind. The Ortiaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blaz - ing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a rep - resentation of the ground floor of King Solomons Temple, and is emblematic of hu - man life, checkered with good and evil The Indented Tessel is a representation of the beautiful tessellated border or skirting which surrounded the pavement, and is emblematic of the manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a faithful reliance upon Divine Providence, hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. The Lights of a Lodge are three, situated in the East. West, and South. As you may observe, there is none in the North, because 8 FIRST DEGREE. King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was situated so far north of the ediptic that neither the sun nor moon, at meridian height, could dart its rays into the notth pare of the building. The North, therefore, among Masons, has always been termed a place of darkness. The )eweir of a Lodge are six: three im - movable, and three movable. The Immovable Jewels are the Square, the Level, and the Plumb; and they are teimed immovable be - cause they are the jewels of the three princi - pal officers of the Lodge, the Worshipful Master, the Senior and Junior Wardens, who are always stationed in the East, West, and South. The Square denotes morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of life. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ash - lar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adjusted by the wotking-tools of the Fellow Craft. The Trestle Board is for the Master Workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of 9 www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus .nl www .stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www . stichtingargus.nl wwwstichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"1~ www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www, stichtingargus.nl www,stichtingargus.nl www, stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www~stichtingargus.n1 www.stichtingargus .nl www .stichtingargus .n 1 www. stichtingargus.nl www.

This tabernacle was an exact model for King Solomon’s Temple, for which reason all Masonic Lodges are, or should be, situated due East and West. Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solomon, as it is said that he was our first 10 FIRST DEGREE. Most Excellent Grand Master. Lodges at the present time are dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry, and since their time there is, or should be, represented in every regular Lodge a certain point within a circle, the point representing an individual brother, and the circle the boundary line of his conduct, beyond which he should never suffer his passions, his prej - udices or his interests to betray him This cirde is supported by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, and on its top rest the Holy Writings In tracing its circumference we necessarily touch upon the parallel lines and also upon the Holy Bible; and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he can maretially err The three principal tenets of Masonry are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth BROTHERLY LOVE.

On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion; and causes true friendship to exist among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEP. To relieve the distressed is a duty incum - bent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked togethet by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the un - happy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to re - store peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our con- I nections. TRUTH. Truth is a divine attribute and the founda - tion of every viitue To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, 12 FIRST DEGREE. sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and with heart and tongue we join in pro - moting each other’s welfare and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. TEMPERANCE, FORTITUDE, PRU - DENCE, AND JUSTICE TEMPERANCE is that due restraint upon the affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and fiees the mind from the alluremenes of vice. This virtue should be your constant practice, as you are thereby taught to avoid excess or the contracting of any licentious or vicious habits, the indul - gence in which might lead you to disclose some of those valuable secrets which you have promised to conceal and never reveal, which would consequently sublect you to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons, 13"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www, stichtingargus.nl www,stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www, stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www .stichtingargus .n 1 www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nI www.stichtingargus.n I www.stichtingargus.n I www.StichtingarguS.n I www.stichtingargus.n I www.stichtingargus.n I www. stichtingargus. n I www . stichtingargus.nl www .stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www .stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus .nl www .stichtingargus .nl www .stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www .stichtingargus.nl www .stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stlchtingarguS.nl FIRST DEGREE. FORTITUDE is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril, or danger, when piudentially deemed e2tpedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice, and, like the lormer virtue, should be deeply impressed upon your mind, as a safeguard or security against any illegal attempt which may be made, by force os otherwise, to extort from you any of those valuable secrets wish which you have been so solemnly intrusred, and which was em - blematically represented on your first admission into the lodge, ~ PRUDENCE teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that faculty by which we wisely judge and prudentially determine on all things relative to our presenr, as well as our future happi - ness This virtue should be your peculiar characteristic, not only for the government of your conduct while in she Lodge, but also when abroad in the world. You should be particularly careful, in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, solsen, or word, whereby the secrets of Free - masonry might be unlawfully obtained; FIRST DEGREE. JUSTICE is that standard or boundary of right which enables us to render unto every man his lust due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and, as justice in a great measuie constitutes the really good man, so should it be your invariable practice never to deviate from the minu test principles thereof; CHARGE.

As a Mason, you are to regard the volume of the Sacred Law as the great light in your profession; to consider it as the unerring standard of truth and justice; and to regulate your actions by the divine precepts it contains.

It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happi - ness It leads the contemplative Mason to view with reverence and admiration the glori - ous works of the Creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator. * IN SIX DAYS God created the heaven and the earth, and rested on the seventh day.

OF ITS ANTIQUITY. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the ligor of seasons first obliged men to contrive shelter fiom the indemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a cov - ering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of she base and capital of pillars, and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of archi - recture. The five Orders are thus classed the Tus - can, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite OF THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE The ancient and original orders of archi - tecture, esteemed by Masons, are no more than three, the Doric, ionic and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans added two, the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essen - tially differ from each other, the two others 22 I SECOND DEGREE. having nothing but that which is borsowed, and differing only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state, and the Com - posite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture.

ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY By this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs, the general, to airange his soldiers, the en - gineer, to mark out grounds for encampments; the geographer, to give us the dimensions of the world and all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of seas, and to specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and prov - inces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the dura - tion of times and seasons, years and cycles.

By it we discover the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Great Arrificer of the Universe, and view with delight the propor - tions which connect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their respective orbits, and demonstrate their var - ious revolutions. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all con - ducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the Divine plan, and to study symmetry, and order. This gave rise to so - cieties and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design; and the plans which he laid down, being improved by time and experience, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monu - ments of antiquity on which the utmost exer - tions of human genius were employed.

Masonry is a progressive moral science, divided into different degrees; and, as its principles and mystic ceremonies are regu - larly developed and illustrated, it is intended and hoped that they will make a deep and lasting impression upon your mind. It is unnecessary to recapitulace the duties which as a Fellow Craft, you are bound to discharge. Your general good reputation affords satisfactory assurance that you will not suffer any consideration to induce you to act in a manner unworthy of the respect - able character which you now sustain; but that, on the contraiy, ~,ou will ever display the discretion, the virtue, and the dignity which become a worthy and exemplary Mason Our laws and regulations you are stren - uously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate nor aggravate the offenses of your brethren, but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and repiehend with justice. 27"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"K wwwstichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus .nl www.stichtingargus .nl www.stichtingargus nl www,stichtingargusnl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus .nl wwwstichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl wwwstichtingargus.nl wwwstichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.n I www.stichtingargusn I www.stichtingargus.n I www.stichtingargus.nI www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargusnl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargusnl www.stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl www - stichtingargus.nl www stichtingargus.nl www.st ichtingargus.nl SECOND DEGREE.

We also learn from the same Sacred Soutce that David, King of Israel, desired to build the house, but that, in consequence of his reign having been one of many wars and much bloodshed, that distinguished privilege was denied him. He was nor, howevet, left with - out hope, for God promised him that our of his loins there should come a man who would be adequate to the performance of so great and glorious an undertaking.

It teaches us, that 38 EMBLEMS as we came into the world rational and intel - ligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are in want, espe - cially when is is in our powers to relieve them, without inconvenience to ourselves, When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his infanry, more helpless and in - digent than the brute creation, he lies Ian - ~u ishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather It might have pleased the Gieat Creator of heaven and earth, to have made man inde - pendent of all other beings; but as depend - ence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind werc made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as nor to be en - deavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless mem - ber of society, and unworthy of our prorec - iion as Masons. 39"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus .nl www,stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargus.nl www, stichtingargus .nl www.stichtingargus nl www.stichtingargus .nl www.stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargus.nl ww’,v. stichtingargus.nl www. stichtingargus.nl wwwstichtingargusnl ww’,v. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargus .nl www.stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargusnl ww’.v. stichtingargus n I www. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargus nl www. stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargus.nl www.stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargus .nl www. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargusnl www. stichtingargusnl wwwstichtingargusnl www. stichtingargus nl ww’.v. stichtingargus nl WWW.

THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS GUARDED BY THE TILER’S SWORD reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words and ac - tions, particularly when befoie the enemies of Masonry; ever bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and ew - cumspectf on. THE SWORD POINTING TO A NAKED HEART demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that THE ALL-SEEING EYE, Whom the sun, moon and stars obey, and under Whose watchful care, even comets per - form their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. THE ANCHOR AND ARK are emblems of a well-grounded hope, and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that 40 EMBLEMS.

This was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great PYTHAGORAS, who, in his travels thiough Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of Priest - hood, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things and more espenally in Geometry, Or Masonry On this subject he drew our many problems and theorems, and among the most distinguished, he erected this, which, in the joy of his heart, he call Eureka, in the Grecian language signifying, I have found it, and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrilked a hecaromb.
