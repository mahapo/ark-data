NI.: (Recites Historical Lecture:) 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"HISTORICAL LECTURE The Scriptures inform us that for their sins, and those of their forefathers, the Jewish people were led into captivity by Nebuzar-adan, Captain of the Guard of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon. As slaves they tilled the valley of the Euphrates and of the Tigris, until Cyrus destroyed the Chaldean dynasty. During that captivity, Zerubbabel, Crown Prince of the house of Judah, and Darius, son of Hystaspes, formed an alliance of friendship which was probably terminated only with death. One of the first acts of Cyrus was the liberation of the Jewish captives. He then permitted them to return to Judea, that they might rebuild the City of Jerusalem and its Temple, which Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed. The foundation of the Second Temple was laid five hun - dred and thirty-five years before Christ—Zerubbabel, the Royal Prince, Jeshua, the High Priest, and Haggal, the Prophet, laying the same. Cyrus died, and his son, Cambyses, succeeded him on the Medo-Persian throne. On complaint of the Cutheans, and other contiguous tribes, Cambyses commanded the work of the City and Temple to cease. During the nine years that followed, scarcely anything was done on the walls of Jerusalem, or the Temple. Cambyses died and the Magians seized the throne, from which their usurper was driven, in a little over a year, with great slaughter. Then the Seven Great Families of Persia laid hold of the government, and Darius ascended the throne. He appointed Zerubbabel, his friend, to be Governor of the Jews that had returned to Mount Zion under the decree of Cyrus the Great, and afterwards ap - pointed him to that place of great trust—a guard of the 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Royal Bed-chamber—for the protection of the person of the King. There were three of these Guards, and they were chosen by the Monarch because of his implicit con - fidence in their loyalty. Fifteen years after the Jews had laid the foundation of the Second Temple (520 B.C.) they were forced to call a Grand Council to consult about the state of the country. Cambyses was dead, and the Magian usurper, Smerdis, had been driven from the throne, to give place to Darius, son of Hystaspes, whose favoring of the Jews was believed to be almost as marked as that of the Great Cyrus. Darius spread a feast at his capitol, and invited thereto the Princes and Rulers of the realm. That feast was thoroughly enjoyed, and at its close “they every one de - parted to bed at their own house, and Darius the King went to bed.” The Ring slept lightly, and awaking he fell into con - versation with his Three Guards. He suggested, as a part of the festivities of the morrow, that they three engage in a public discussion of some interesting question, as had been the custom on similar occasions from time imme - morial, and that he would reward with a princely gift the successful contestant. The King then propounded the following question: “Whether Wine was not the strongest ?—Whether Kings were not such?—Whether Women were not such, or whether Truth were not the strongest of all.” Esdras makes the Guards suggest both the questions and the prize, but we follow the story as told by Josephus. Again the King slept, and the Guards prepared for the friendly contest of the following morning. When the King arose he sent for the Princes and Rulers to meet him in 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"the Audience Chamber, and witness the contest between his Guards. The contest began in time by one of the Guards de - claiming in favor of the strength of Wine, followed by another in favor of the power of the King. Then the Jew, Zerubbabel, contended for the supereminency of Women, concluding with a noble deliverance in favor of Truth. The brilliant assembly burst forth into applause when Zerubbabel concluded, and the King awarded him the prize, with these words: “Ask for somewhat over and above what I have promised, for I will give it unto you because of your wisdom.” Then “Zerubbabel put him in mind of the vow he had made in case he should ever have the kingdom.” Now this vow was “to rebuild Jerusalem, and to rebuild therein the Temple of God, and also to restore the vessels which Neb - uchadnezzar had pillaged, and carried to Babylon.” And behold the King was pleased to arise and to kiss his eloquent Guard, Zerubbabel, and to grant his request. Zerubbabel returned to his people iii Jerusalem with great joy, and the rebuilding of the City and Temple was imme - diately resumed. Darius not only kept his vow, but made large contributions to the rebuilding out of the Royal Treasury. The details adopted to more beautifully round out the drama, and more pointedly teach the lesson of the almighty force and the importance of Truth, do not intrench upon the facts of history. The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross is not a Pagan rite nor is it a mere social observance. It is an Order founded upon Truth, and is a proper preparation for the solemnities of the Order of the Temple. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Darius believed in the one God, when he registered a vow to rebuild the City and Temple of Jerusalem, a vow he religiously kept. “Blessed be the God of Truth,” on the lips of Darius purges the memory of his early reign from al~ taint of Sabianism, into which he wandered in later life. As Judaism was a preparation for Christianity, so let the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross be a preparation for the Christian Order of the Temple. S. M.: Today, you and each of you are Zerubbabel, as we go back in time to the Court of King Darius and the Founding of th~ New Order.

After the death of Cyrus, the Jews, whom he liber - ated and sent back to Jerusalem, were forbidden by Cambyses, his son and successor, to continue the work of rebuilding, and at the time this Council was convened the work had ceased during several years. Zerubbabel, the royal Prince of the House of Judah, participated in the deliberations of that Council, and we have admitted you to this presence in expectation that you will assume the name and represent the char - acter of that illustrious Prince, whose hands laid the foundation of the Second Temple, and whose hands the Lord promised should finish it.

Under the direction of Jeshua and Kadmiel the foundation of the Temple was laid amidst the sound of trumpets and cymbals, and praising the Lord according to the ordinance of King David. And oil the people shouted with a great shout, and they sang together in praising and giving thanks to the Lord because He is good, for His mercy endureth forever toward Israel. When the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple unto the Lord God of Israel, they came to Zerubbabel and asked permission to assist in the work, saying ‘‘Let us build with you; for we seek your God as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-Haddon, King of Assur, which brought us up hither,” but they are refused because King Cyrus ordered the work to be done by the Jews. They thereupon engaged in a campaign of harassment and false accusations which continued until the death of King Cyrus. Cyrus was succeeded by his son Cambyses who reigned for nine years, and during that period little or nothing was done on the walls of Jerusalem or the Temple. When Artaxerxes ascended the throne, Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote to him in the Syrian language saying that if Jerusalem be builded again, the Jews would no longer pay toll, tribute, and custom and thus endanger the revenue of the king. Artaxerxes answered the letter by issuing an order that the city not be builded and that all work cease. When King Artaxeries’ letter was read before Rehum and ~liimshai and their companions, they went quickly to Jerusalem unto the Jews and made them cease by force and power. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"And so all work ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius, King of Persia, a period of fifteen years after the Jews laid the foundation of the second temple.

M.: From time immemorial it has been the custom of the Sovereigns of this realm, on occasions like the present, to propose certain topics for consideration, and to bestow princely gifts upon the one found wisest in the discussion. In conformity to that custom I now pro - pose the following question, with the assurance that he who gives the most satisfactory answer shall be suitably rewarded. Which is the greatest :— The strength of Wine, The power of the King, or The influence of Woman? Prince Chancellor, what say you? P. C.: [Arises, bows.] Sovereign Master, it is the opinion of your Chancellor that the strength of Wine is the greatest. S. M.: Prince Master of the Palace, what is your opinion? P. M.

C.: [Companion Conductor and Zerubbabel arise and bow. 3 I have, your Majesty. In my humble opinion the influence of Woman is greater than the strength of Wine, or the power of the King, but above all things TRUTh beareth away the victory. S. I\\I. : Sayest thou that TRUTH beareth away the victory! Prince Zerubbabel, that is an important addi - 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"tion you have made to our question, and it shall have consideration. Princes and Rulers, let the discussion now begin. Prince Chancellor, are you prepared to maintain your opinion by argument? If so, begin. P. C.: [Arises, bows.] 0 ye Princes and Rulers, how exceedingly strong is WINE! It causeth all men to err that drink it; it maketh the mind of the king and the beggar to be all one; of the bondman and the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich; it turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remem - bereth neither sorrow nor debt; it changeth and elevateth the spirits, and enliveneth the heavy hearts of the miser - able. It maketh a man forget his brethren, and draw his sword against his best friends. 0 ye Princes and Rulers, is not WINE the strongest, that forceth us to do these things? S. M.: Prince Chancellor, your argument is well- chosen. Prince Master of the Palace, are you prepared to defend your position? P. M. P.: [Arises, bows.] It is beyond dispute, O Princes and Rulers, that God has made man master of all things under the sun; to command them, to make use of them, and apply them to his service as he pleases; but whereas men have only dominion over other sublunary creatures, KINGS have an authority even over men them - selves, and a right of ruling them by will and pleasure. Now, he that is master of those who are masters of all things else, hath no earthly thing above him. S. M.: Prince Master of the Palace, your argument is both pleasing and forcible, being well-calculated to main - tain the dignity of the throne. And now, Prince 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Zerubbabel, we will hear the reason for your opinion, and for the important addition you have made to our question. C. C.: [Arises with Zerubbabet and both bow.] 0 Princes and Rulers, the force of Wine is not to be denied; neither is that of Kings, that unites so many men in one common bond of allegiance; but the supereminency of WOMAN is yet above all this; for Kings are but the gifts of WOMEN, and they are also the mothers of those that cultivate our vineyards. WOMEN have the power to make us abandon our very country and relations, and many times to forget the best friends we have in the world, and, forsaking all other comforts, to live and die with them. But when all is said, neither they, nor Wine, nor Kings, are comparable to the almighty force of TRUTH. As for all other things, they are mortal and transient, but TRUTH alone is un - changeable and everlasting; the benefits we receive from it are subject to no variations or vicissitudes of time or fortune. In her judgment is no unrighteousness, and she is the strength, wisdom, power, and majesty of all ages. BLESSED BE THE GOD OF TRUTH. [When Companion Conductor concludes, the Prince Chancellor and Prince Master of the Palace will arise and exclaim:) P. C. and P. M. P.: [Together.] Great is TRUTH and mighty above all things! S.

And now, 0 King, this is that I desire of thee, that thou make good the vow, the performance whereof, with thine own mouth, thou hast vowed to the King of heaven. S.

The following is suggested as helpful to such an ex - planation:] The Scriptures inform us that for their sins, and those of their forefathers, the Jewish people were led into captivity by Nebuzar-adan, Captain of the Guard of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon. As slaves they tilled the valley of the Euphrates and of the Tigris, until Cyrus destroyed the Chaldean dynasty. During that captivity Zerubbabel, Crown Prince of the House of Judah, and Darius, son of Hystaspes, formed an alliance of friendship which was probably terminated only with death. One of the first acts of Cyrus was the liberation of the Jewish captives. He then permitted them to return to Judea, that they might rebuild the City of Jerusalem, and its Temple, which Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed. The foundation of the Second Temple was laid five hundred and thirty-five years before Christ; Zerubbabel, the Roy~d Prince, Jeshua, the High Priest, and Haggai, the Prophet, laying the same. Cyrus died, and his son, Cambyses, succeeded him on the Medo-Persian throne. On complaint of the Cutheans, and other contiguous tribes, Cambyses commanded the work of the City and Temple to cease. During the nine years that followed, scarcely anything was done on the walls of Jerusalem, or the Temple. 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Cambyses died and the Magians seized the throne, from which their usurper was driven, in a little over a year, with great slaughter. Then the Seven Great Families of Persia laid hold of the government, and Darius ascended the throne. He appointed Zerubbabel, his friend, to be Governor of the Jews that had returned to Mount Zion under. the decree of Cyrus the Great, and afterwards ap - pointed him to that place of great trust—a Guard of the Royal Bed-chamber —for the protection of the person of the King. There were three of these Guards, and they were chosen by the Monarch because of his implicit con - fidence in their loyalty. Fifteen years after the Jews had laid the foundation of the Second Temple (520 B.C.) they were forced to call a Grand Council to consult about the state of the coun - try. Cambyses was dead, and the Magian usurper, Smerdis, had been driven from the throne, to give place to Darius, son of Hystaspes, whose favoring of the Jews was believed to be almost as marked as that of the Great Cyrus. Darius spread a feast at his capitol, and invited thereto the Princes and Rulers of the realm. That feast was thor - oughly enjoyed, and at its close “they every one departed to bed at their own house, and Darius the King went to bed.” The ~King slept lightly, and awaking he fell into con - versation with his Three Guards. He suggested, as a part of the festivities of the morrow, that they three engage in a public discussion of some interesting question, as had been the custom on similar occasions from time immemorial, and that he would reward with a princely gift the successful contestant. The King then propounded the following question: 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"“Whether Wine was not the strongest ?—Whether Kings were not such ?—Whether Women were not such, or whether Truth were not the strongest of all?” Esdras makes the Guards suggest both the questions and the prize, but we follow the story as told by Josephus. Again the King slept, and the Guards prepared for the friendly contest of the following morning. When the King arose he sent for the Princes and Rulers to meet him in the Audience Chamber, and witness the contest between his Guards. The contest began in time by one of the Guards de - claiming in favor of the strength of Wine, followed by another in favor of the power of the King. Then the Jew, Zerubbabel, contended for the supereminency of Women, concluding with a noble deliverance in favor of Truth. The brilliant assembly burst forth into applause when Zerubbabel concluded, and the King awarded him the prize, with these words: “Ask for somewhat over and above what I have promised, for I will give it unto you because of your wisdom.” Then “Zerubbabel put him in mind of the vow he had made in case he should ever have the kingdom.” Now this vow was “to rebuild Jerusalem, and to rebuild therein the Temple of God, and also to restore the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged and carried to Babylon.” And behold the King was pleased to arise and to kiss his eloquent Guard, Zerubbabel, and to grant his request. Zerubbabel returned to his people in Jerusalem with great joy, and the rebuilding of the City and Temple was imme - diately resumed. Darius not only kept his vow, but made large contributions to the rebuilding out of the Royal Tr’~isury. 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The details adopted to more beautifully round out the drama, and more pointedly teach the lesson of the al - mighty force and the importance of Truth, do not in- trench upon the facts of history. The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross is not a Pagan rite, nor is it a mere social observance. It is an Order founded upon Truth, and is a proper preparation for the solemnities of the Order of the Temple. Darius believed in the one God when he registered a vow to ~rebuild the City and Temple of Jerusalem, a vow he religiously kept. “Blessed be the God of Truth,” on the lips of Darius, purges the memory of his early reign from all taint of Sabianism, into which he wandered in later life. As Judaism was a preparation for Christianity, so let the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross be a preparation for the Christian Order of the Temple.

Take this mantle with the Cross in the name of our Holy Religion, and St. John the Baptist, for the improvement of your faith, the defense of Christianity, and the service of the poor. For this reason we put the Cross on your breast, that you may love it with all your heart, and that with your right hand you may be ever ready to defend it. 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"I must admonish you, my Brother, should it ever happen, that in comb atting the enemies of our Order you should prove unfaithful to your vows, turn your back on your enemies and desert the standard of the Cross and fly, you will be deprived of that Holy Sign, according to the ancient statutes and customs of our Order, being false to the professions you have made, and you will be cast out from among us as an un - worthy and corrupt member.

It is the Maltese Cross. Its eight points are symbolical of the eight languages into which the Or - der was formerly divided.

The Sign and Grip: One says, “Reach hither thy finger and feel the print of the nails.” They join right hands and force the first finger into the center of the palm. Then he says, “Reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side.” Each extends his left hand and presses his fingers into the left side of the other, still holding on by the grip; with arms thus crossed they gijve the Word. One says, “MY LORD;” the other responds “AND MY GOD.” The name of this sign and grip is “Infidelitas’ ‘—unbelief. It teaches us that there is an unbelief which transcends a ra - tional skepticism; that we should possess a power of faith to receive Divine Truth, even though unaccom - panied by physical evidence, and thus entitle us to that commendation of our Divine Teacher, “Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.” 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"I will now invest you with the Grand Hailing Sign and Grand Word of a Knight of Malta; also the Grand Token and Word of the Order.

Prior: Knight Marshal, you will instruct the newly made Knight of Malta. HISTORICAL AND EXPLANATORY LECTURE Marshal: My Brother, I will now direct your at - tention to a brief r~sum6 of the History of this Ancient Chivalric Order, and its bearing upon the present ceremonies. While doing so we will pass by the different ceremonial banners, and their signif - icance in connection with the history and traditions of the Order will be explained to you. [They proceed and halt at the first banner, “Birth.’’] Banner Guard: This Order was founded at Je - rusalem in the year of our Lord 1099, by the asso - ciation of a number of pious Knights with the fratres of St. John ‘s hospital, an establishment previously formed (Footnote 9, page 94.) for the relief of pil - grims who had come to worship at the i-ioly Sepulchre. The name and date upon the white banner, “Birth,” “Palestine, 1099,” commemorates the country of our Saviour’s nativity; the place where the Order was founded, and the first epoch in its history. 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"[They pass to the second banner, “Life.’’] Banner Guard: After a troubled existence of two hundred years in the Hoiy Land, and being deprived by the wars raging in Europe of needed and looked- for assistance, the Order was compelled to evacuate Palestine, and in 1287 it established itself on the Island of Cyprus, and settled in Limisso. The name and date upon the red banner, ~ ‘‘Cyprus, 1287,” commemorates the second place of their so - journing, and the second epoch in their history. [They pass to the third banner, “Death.”] Banner Guard: On the fifth of August, 1310, the Island of Rhodes became the property of the Order by right of conquest from the Saracens. In 1312 the Order was strengthened in numbers and enriched by the sequestered property of the Knights Templar, who were in that year suppressed by the cruelty and avarice of Pope Clement V and Phillip the Fair, King of France. This was the first direct approach to that union between the two Orders, which was subsequently formally decreed by the Pope. From this period they were known as the Knights of Rhodes. The remains of the fortifications erected there by the Knights, still bear testimony of their engi~ieering skill and ability. In 1522 the Island of Rhodes was besieged by the Turks under the Emperor Solyman II, and after a memorable defense, their fortifications being reduced to ruins, scarcely one stone remaining standing upon another, they were compelled to surrender and evac - uate the island, after an occupancy of more than two hundred years. So deeply had their desperate prowess excited the admiration of their foes, and so 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"firmly implanted were the chivalric ideas of the time, even in the bosom of the infidels, that the Knights were allowed to withdraw unmolested, and with the honors of war. The name and date upon the black banner, “Death,” “Rhodes, 1310,” commemorates the third place of the sojourning of these valiant Knights, and the third epoch in their history. [They pass to the fourth banner, “Resurrection.”] Banner Guard: During the period from 1523 to 1530 the Order ceased to exist as a sovereign power, and the remnants of it wandered from place to place without a home. During this most depressing period in their history, they went, first to Castro in the Island of Candia, thence successively to Venice, Viturbo, Villa Franca, Syracuse, and Messina. The name and date of the purple banner, “Resurrection,” “Candia, 1523,” commemorates this the fourth memorable period in the history of the Order. [They pass to the fifth banner, “Ascension.”] Banner Guard: On the 24th of March, 1530, the Emperor, Charles V, ceded the Island of Malta to the Order, upon condition that they would defend it and repress the ravages of the Moorish rovers, who at that time infested the southern ports of the Mediter - ranean~. Sea. Accordingly, under L ‘Isle Adam, the then Grand Master—one of the brightest names in the history of the Order—they took possession of the Island, and thenceforth acquired the additional title of Knights of Malta. The name and date on the yellow banner, “Ascension,” “Malta, 1530,” com - memorates this the fifth memorable period in the his - tory of the Order. Ithtrshal: The legend connected with the ap - 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"proach of the Knights to their final and most re - nowned abiding place has given rise to the distinguish - ing Sign and Word of the Order. The tradition runs, that on coming to take possession of the Island, the Knights approached the shore in their galleys, two men to an oar, the oars in their left hands and their swords in their right hands, singing a psalm as they rowed, in these words: “Rex Regum et Dominus Dominorum” (English, “King of Kings and Lord of Lords”). The islanders seeing them approach in this warlike manner, hailed them through a speaking trumpet, saying in the Arabic language, “Ah tie toom bis sah lahm?” (Do you come in peace?) To which the Knights responded in the same tongue, “Ah tie nah bis sah lahm.” (We come in peace.) Then the island - ers responded, “Fa two bis sah lahm.” (Then come in peace). It is worthy of note that these words, or sub - stantially the same, are the common form of saluta - tion between an Arab and a stranger at the present day. (Footnote 10, page 94.) We hold that the Order now conferred upon you has direct connection with the religious branches of the old Order. It preserves the memory of the Union that took place between the persecuted Templars and the Knights of St. John, and which was continued in Scotland, where the combined Orders held their lands in common up to the time of the dispersion of the re - ligious houses at the Reformation. We, as Masons, perpetuate, cultivate and practice the Christian and chivalric principles of the Ancient Order, in connec - tion with that of the Templars, as a peaceful Chris - tian society, to which we now welcome you as a brother. The Mediterranean Pass, which you received in the introductory degree of Knights of St. Paul, tradition 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"informs us, was instituted at an early period of the Order to enable pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land to recognize each other, and as a protection against the Moorish rovers who infested the Mediter - ranean Sea and Palestine. According to the American Ritual seven officers compose a Priory. They are the Prior, Lieutenant Commander, Captain General, Chaplain, Marshal, Captain of the Outposts, and Guard. The first five of these officers are supposed to be seated at the table in the East, on which is repre - sented the upper and transverse limbs of a Latin Cross. Their naked swords, when deposited on the table, all point to one spot—the center—where the heart of our Saviour rested when he suffered upon the Cross. This is symbolic in a degree of the Chris - tian character of the Order. The number 5 also symbolically reminds us of the passion of our Blessed Saviour, and of his five wounds upon the Cross. The number is again repeated in the rounds of the ladder, depicted in one of the quarters of the circle upon the Cross on the table in the West. A Knight at the Table in the West: There are eight Knights seated at the table in the West. Ac - cording to the European Ceremonial, these Knights are officers of the Priory. They represent the eight languages into which the Order was formerly divided, which were: Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Aragon, Germany, Castile, Anglo-Bavaria. The table at which these Knights are seated has depicted upon it a large Maltese Cross, on the center of which is a circle, divided into four equal quarter- 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ings by two transverse bars crossing each other at right angles in the center. Each of the four quarters of the circle has a figure depicted upon it: 1. A ship or ancient galley. 2. A ladder, with five rounds or steps, with the letters B. L. D. R. A., one on each step, and a speaking trumpet. 3. A hand and a serpent. 4. A human skull, cloven in twain from the top with a double-edged sword, and a spear be - neath it. The galley reminds us of the maritime character of the Ancient Order, both in war and commerce. The letters on the steps of the ladder correspond with those on the five ceremonial banners, and are the initial letters of the pass-words on those banners. The hand and the serpent reminds us of the his - tory of St. Paul, in connection with the Island of Malta. The human skull, cloven by the two-edged sword, reminds us of the penalty that was inflicted upon traitors to the Order in ancient times. The spear again reminds us of the passion of our Blessed Saviour, for with such an instrument they pierced His side. Marshal: I will now direct your attention to the Grand Banners of the Order, of which there are two: the Banner of St. John, and that of Malta. Bainner Guard: The Banner of St. John is red, having painted upon it a white Greek Cross, the bars of the Cross extending to the edge of the banner, and on the center of the Cross a “Pascha]. Lamb.” The letters F. E. R. T. are also on the banner, one in each quarter. These are the initial letters of the four words in the Latin sentence, “Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit,” which in English is “His courage preserved 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Rhodes.” According to a tradition of the Order, these letters upon the banner had their origin during the Grand Mastership of Villaret, early in the fourteenth century. In 1315 the Turks laid siege to Rhodes, the new home of the Order, and were repulsed by the brave Christian Knights. Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, having rendered timely and valuable as - sistance to the besieged Knights Hospitalers during this attack, the Grand Master, in commemoration thereof, caused the letters to be added to the Banner of St. John. The descendants of the Count Amadeus have, since that time, always borne on their shield a white cross, with the word FEWr as a deviee,—the word being composed of the initial letters of the Latin words, as before described. Banner Guo,rd: The Maltese Banner is black, having upon it a silver or white Maltese Cross, with a Cross of St. John on a small shield resting on the center. (Footnote 11, page 94.) Around the Cross the legend, “Rex Regum et Dominus Dominorum.” [Revelations, 19:16. King James Version.] [Music: Finale, “Gloria in Excelsis,” after Rex Regum et Dominus Donunorum. If the Prior prefers, the “Gloria” may precede the lecture, though properly it should follow it] Prior: And now, my Brother, in behalf of the Knights of this Priory I bid you a hearty welcome to all the rights and privileges, even to the disinter - ested friendship and unbounded hospitality which ever has distinguished and ~we trust will long continue to adorn and characterize these noble Orders. With the age and the occasion which gave them birth, their adventurous and warlike spirit has passed away, but their moral and beneficent character still remains, briglit in all its primitive beauty and loveliness, to incite, as in days of their greatest glory, that spirit 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"of refined and moral chivalry which should prompt us to press onward in the cause of truth and justice, stimulating us to exertion in behalf of the destitute and oppressed, to wield the sword, if need be, when “Pure and undefiled religion” calls us in her de - fense, and in a Brother ‘s cause, to do all that may become men. They also teach the triumph of im - mortality—that, though death has its sting, its inflic - tion is but for a moment; that this frail organization, though here subject to the many “ills that flesh is heir to,” possesses an immortal soul which shall soar to realms of endless bliss, and, beyond the power of change, to live forever.

(4) Upon occasions of extraordinary pageantry and display, these Knights might have banners with the arms of the respec - iive languages they represent. In that case the banners should precede them and be borne by Esquires in appropriate costume, each banner preceded by a Herald, clothed in the conventional costume.

(7) These signs and words were not in use in the United States, but have always been and are still used in England and Canada; and they are so pertinent to the traditions of the Order that the Committee has included them. (8) In some Priories the Latin words are given as follows: “Rex Regum et Dominus Dominorum.” (9) Founded circa 1048. (10) The Maltese language is a corruption of Arabic and Italian. These sentences are not purely Arabic: “Antum a tanitum besalamt Naham ataina besalam, ly ya salam laikam.” This, however, is of little consequence, as the English sen - tences only are used as mode of recognition in the degree. (11) The description of the Maltese banner very nearly ac - cords with the engraving of it as given in Cross ‘s Templar Chart, 1821, and repeated in all subsequent editions. That is the earliest American pictorial illustration of the banner we have. The motto “Rex Regum et Do minus Dominorum” is not given as belonging to the banner in England or Canada, but it is pre-eminently ap - propriate, and having already been in use for a number of years in this country it is retained.

While the world is shut out, meditate upon these things, and prepare your heart for the solemn ceremonies through which you will be called to pass. There lies on the table before you a melancholy memento of mortality. Beside it is an Hour Glass, which I now reverse. As you behold its slowly-falling sands, learn that so surely are the wasting sands of your mortal life running out to death. There is also on this table the Holy Bible, which is opened at the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. I enjoin upon you at this time the reading of the thirteenth to the sixteenth verses inclusive of that chapter. When you shall have concluded the reading you will discover three Questions, to which your explicit answers are re - Quired in writing. Reflect on them, and then answer each with a simple “Yes” or “No,” according to the dictates of your conscience. Then sign your name, IN FULL, to each of them. I am now about to leave you alone, and will signal my departure by three knocks upon the door. Hearing them, you will remove the hoodwink, and proceed as I have directed.

Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, 0 my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

Then -the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common ball, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, hail, King of the Jews! And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. And they crucified him, a.nd parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet. They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.” (Matt. 28:7.10.

And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.” (Luke 24:50, 51. King James Version.) [Ascension Scene, during which a hymn may be sung. Then,] PRELATE ‘S ADDRESS P.: Pilgrim, the scene you have just witnessed is in - tended to remind you of the glorious conclusion of that hallowed sacrifice offered by the Redeemer of the world to provide a way of salvation to fallen man. This sacred book [Shows him the Bible.] informs us that our blessed Saviour, after suffering the pains of death, descended into the place of departed spirits; that on the third day He burst the bands of death, triumphed over the grave, and in due time ascended with transcend - ent majesty into heaven, where He now sits at the right hand of our Heavenly Father, a Mediator and Intercessor for all those who have faith in Him. I now invest you with an emblem of that faith [Pu- grim invested with a Cross]; it is also a badge of our Order, which you will wear as a constant memorial to stimulate you to imitate the virtues of the Immaculate Jesus, who died that you might live. Pilgrim, the ceremonies in which you are now engaged are intended to deeply impress your mind, and I trust they will have a happy and lasting effect upon your life and character. You were first, as a trial of your patience and perse - verance, required to perform Seven Years of Pilgrimage. It represented the great pilgrimage of life through which you are now passing. We are all weary pilgrims, 136"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"anxiously looking forward to that Asylum above, where we shall rest from our labors, and be at peace forever. You were next, as a trial of your courage and con - stancy, required to perform Four Years of Warfare. It was to remind you of that continual warfare with the lying deceits and vanities of the world, in which it is necessary for you always to be engaged. You are now performing One Year of Penance, as a trial of your humility. Of this our blessed Saviour has left us the only perfect example; who, though H& was the Eternal Son of God, humbled Himself to be born of a woman, to endure the pains and sorrows incident to human life, and finally to suffer the cruel and igno - minious death of the cross. This penance is also a trial of that faith which will conduct you safely through the dark valley of the shadow of death, and land your enfranchised spirit in the peace - ful abodes of the blessed. Pilgrim, ever keep in mind this solemn truth: you know not how soon you may be called upon to render an account unto the Supreme Judge, from whom the minutest act of your life is not hidden. Although you now stand erect in’ all the pride and strength of man - hood, yet in a few brief moments you may be cold in death. This moment, even while I speak, the angel of death may receive the dread mandate to strike you from the roll of the living; and the friends who now surround you be called upon to perform the last sad duty of laying you in the earth, a banquet for worms, and this frail body become as the relic you hold in your hand. “Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometli forth like a. flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. In the midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek for succor but of Thee, 137"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased? Yet, 0 Lord God, most holy, 0 Lord most mighty, 0 holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.” “And I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me, Write: Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.” Pilgrim, be you always ready, and rest assured that a firm faith in the truth herein revealed, and a childlike trust in our crucified and ascended Saviour, will not only afford you consolation in the gloomy hour of dissolution, but will also secure you ineffable and eternal happiness in the world to come. Farewell! Ever remember the hallowed sacrifice on Calvary. [Prelate returns to Asylum, and Wardens conduct the Pilgrim Penitent thither. While walking Senior Warden will say:] S. W.: Pilgrim, your Year of Penance ended, let us repair to the Asylum and humbly crave admission. [At entrance of Asylum Senior Warden alarms by light raps ~ ~.

They remain in that position until after the Commander demands “Whom have you there in charge?” Then they will arise and come to carry swords. This ceremony is intended to represent the filling of the va - cancy in the Apostolic College. Nine Knights are kneeling when the Wardens and Pilgrim Penitent enter.

In the hand of a Valiant and Magnanimous Knight of the Temple, it is endowed with three excellent qualities: its hilt with Jus - tice impartial, its blade with Fortitude undaunted, and its point with Mercy unrestrained. Learn from these this important lesson: that when you draw your sword, you should be well assured of the Justice of the cause in which you are engaged; being thus assured, press f or- word with Fortitude undaunted to victory; and having ~subdued your enemy, regard him no longer as your foe, but extend to him that glorious attribute of Deity,— Mercy. As a Knight Templar, let your honor ever remain as unsullied as this glittering blade, and hold your sword ready to be drawn in the cause to which you have so solemnly consecrated it; hoping ever, and praying always for the advent of that glorious day when “the mountain of the lord ‘s house shall be established in the top of the mountains”; when “swords shall be beaten into plough- shares and spears into pruning hooks”; when “nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more”; when the reign of the Blessed Em - manuel, the Prince of Peace, the Great Captain of our Salvation, shall become universal and eternal.

The following is suggested as helpful to such an explanation: Sir Knight, in the ceremonies through which you have passed, you represented a Knight of the period that suc - ceeded the Crusades—a civil Knight, who had made a vow to visit the Sepulchre of our Ascended Master. As if you were such a Knight, allow me now to address you. 152"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Attracted by the chivalrous deeds of the Templars,— for their deeds of charity and pure beneficence had spread their fame both far and wide,—you sought admission to their ranks, the better to fulfill that vow. The Commander of the Commandery of Knights Templar, to which you applied for admission, being satis - fied with the report made to him of the uprightness of your character, was moved to grant the prayer of, your petition; but as a trial of your worthiness to be enrolled among the members of the Valiant and Magnanimous Order of the Temple, he enjoined upon you Seven Years of Preparation. Those years began with an unarmed pil - grimage in the direction of the Holy Shrine, and an escort was given you, who would guide and protect you. With - out sword or buckler, and forbidden to do acts unbe - coming a mere Pilgrim, your journey began; and to a man of warlike spirit, such a pilgrimage was indeed a trial of patience and perseverance. Three years passed as you trod your weary way, mostly in a friendly country, in which you received from pious anchorites bread and water, as well as lessons of comfort and consolation. But day after day, during those years, your manhood asserted itself with accumu - lating vigor—when you beheld indignities offered not only to yourself but to other helpless Pilgrims, many of them delicate women—and you yearned to cast off the garb of a Pilgrim, and, laying aside the staff, to grasp the sword and perform deeds of exalted usefulness. Thus yearning, and pleading with your devoted escort, you reached another Commandery of the Templars. Three years of the required preparation had passed, and you begged your escort to crave permission from the Coin - mander to permit you to devote the four remaining years to deeds of more exalted usefulness. 153"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"At this second house of the Templars your escort made known your burning desires, vouched for your integrity, and that you had faithfully performed the duties of three years of your preparation. The avouchment of your escort secured the favorable consideration of the Com - mander, who, after putting you under Vows, granted you permission to take up sword and buckler, and to go forth under escort of a Templar Warrior, manfully wield - ing your sword in the defense of innocent maidens, desti - tute widows, helpless orphans, and the Christian Re - ligion. And such a warfare was indeed a trial of your courage. As a Pilgrim Warrior you pressed forward with forti - tude undaunted, giving ample proof to your warrior escort that you were worthy to bear your sword in the cause to which you had consecrated it. And the constant opportunities to display your valor and chivalry created in you an ardent desire to be admitted where honors and rewards await valorous deeds. Three years passed while you thus manfully fought your way toward the shrine of your Vow. At the close of the third year you reached another house of the Templars, and there you besought your escort to implore remission of the remaining year of preparation. Your Templar escort presented your petition to the Commander of that Commandery, and avouched for your valor, ~ourage and constancy, even recommending the re - mission asked for, if it were possible; and though the Commander was moved by the recital of your deeds of courage and constancy, the number of the years of prep - aration could not be shortened. Moreover, he feared that the memories of those valorous deeds had filled your heart with pride, and that self-confidence had supplanted an humble reliance upon the strong arm of the Master. 154"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"He therefore commanded you to devote the remaining year of your preparation to penance, as a trial of your faith and humility. The penitential year accomplished in and about that Commandery—during which you re - ceived lessons of piety, before representations of the Sepulchre and the Ascension of our Saviour—you were permitted to return to the Asylum and to participate in the Fifth Libation, thereby sealing your Faith, after illustrating both it and your humility. You were then enlisted under the Banner of the Templars and of Em - manuel. Such, Sir Knight, is the brief epitome of the solemn ceremonies through which you have passed. The ancient Order of the Temple was suppressed and its members dispersed, and the warlike spirit of that Order has passed away; but in this modern Order of the Temple there re - mains a spirit of refined and moral chivalry, which should prompt all of its members to be ever-ready to defend the weak, the innocent, the helpless and the oppressed, and in a brother’s cause to do all that may be demanded by manhood and fraternity. And now we hail you Knight as well as Brother. Sacredly observe the Vows you have taken. These Vows bind you to the Order, and to each of us as comrades in arms. May we all at last “Be greeted as Brethren, and received into the widely extended arms of the Blessed Emmanuel.” END OF’ THE VALIANT AND MAGNANIMOUS ORDER OF THE TEMPLE 155"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"ODE TO THE SKULL Behold this ruin! ‘tis a skull, Once of ethereal spirit full; This narrow cell was life ‘s retreat, This space was thought ‘s mysterious seat; What beauteous visions filled this spot, What dream of pleasure long forgot, Nor joy, nor grief, nor hope, nor fear, Has left one trace on record here. Beneath this mouldering canopy Once shone the bright and busy eye; Yet start not at the dismal void! If holy love that eye employed, If with no lawless fire it gleamed, But through the dews of kindness beamed, That eye shall be forever bright, When stars and sun are sunk in night. Within this hollow cavern hung The ready, swift and tuneful tongue; If falsehood ‘s honey it disdained, And when it could not praise, was chained; If bold in virtue ‘s cause it spoke, Yet gentle concord never broke, That silent tongue may plead for thee, When time unveils eternity. 156"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"RESOLUTION In compliance with the Resolution passed at the 54th Tri - ennial Conclave at Indianapolis, Indiana, August 13-16, 1979, the Official Ritual of the Grand Encampment Knights Templar, U.S.A., now reflects those changes.

Many of these words used by the Knights Templar present especial difficulties of pronunciation to those unfamiliar with historic references and foreign lan - guage practices. The present short list of such words has been prepared for the purpose of seeking to make the beautiful work of Templary more impres - sive in its exemplification by procuring uniformly accurate pronunciation of those words used. Every word here listed has been studied in connec - tion with some recognized authority on pronuncia - o tion. Those references used were: FUtk and Wag - nall8’ Standard Dictionary, The Gettury Dictionary, Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, and Phyfe’8 18,000 Words Often Mis pronounced. Each word in this list is accented and the pronun - ciation indicated by diacritical marks, just as the word is shown in the dictionary.

Where this representation may not be per - fectly clear, some comparison or suggestion is given in connection with the word. In the case of those words which admit of more than one pron tinciation the first or preferred pronunciation is given; only in a few instances is a second or accepted pronuncia - tion copied. Latin words and phrases are indicated in one of two ways: (1) if the Latin has been Anglicized, this pronunciation is indicated; (2) but those Latin words and phrases which do not appear in the dictionaries are indicated as Latin is commonly pronounced to - day. In particular, the c in each Latin word is pro - nounced like k. French words are pronounced like modern French. The pronunciation of these words is particularly dif - ficult to represent on paper.

“Companions you have heard the generous offer of Zerubbabel,” that there be inserted, on an optional basis, the following; “Does the Council have any suggestion to make?” Jeremiah (NEGATIVE ARGUMENT)—”Excellent High Priest, as a member of this Grand Council I rise respectfully to pro - test against Prince Zerubbabel undertaking this journey. There is no doubt he is most sincere and courageous—and has a strong desire to serve our people. I hope, however, that this council may use its in - fluence to restrain him from embarking on this truly hazardous enterprize. I feel confident that I voice the sentiment of this Council when I say that our true affection for our beloved Prince is so strong that we hope he may be induced to reconsider his intention. I fear for his safety.” Isaiah (NEGATIVE ARGUMENT)—”Excellent High Priest, information obtained from those who have recently traversed the Syrian Plains makes me tremble for his life. Caravans and travelers afoot have been molested, robbed and in many cases our people have been cruelly slain. On the fords of the Jordan and in the passes far - ther east are bands of robbers and ruffians who neither respect nor fear God nor man. I, too, trust that Prince Zerubbabel may be dissuaded from his undertaking, laudable though his object. But if he feels that he is called to duty, must take the great risk and must go, then I pray that he may be given a strong escort to the most dis - tant point that it may be possible to accompany him. Our prayers are for him and if he must go—then may God go with him.” Haggai (AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENT)—”Excellent High Priest, the words of Companions Isaiah have made a profound im - pression upon my mind; but I am constrained to a different view from that expressed by him regarding the proposed journey of Prince Zerubbabel. I cannot and will not take second place to any member of this Council in my affection for our beloved Prince. I know, however, that the welfare of our people has borne heavily upon his heart and mind of late and that he makes this truly noble and generous offer in a most sincere and earnest desire to serve them. It has been my honor to have the confidence of Prince Zerubbabel and I know that he has; much in prayer to Jehovah, our God, that we might be freed from our present opppression.” 174"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Hosea (AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENT)—”Excellent High Priest, Prince Zerubbabel grasps with eagerness the opportunity to go east for a conference with the new king, believing because of his former friendship he can induce him to save our people. How much longer, I ask, must Jerusalem suffer because of the act of those on the other side of the river? How much longer must our people be kept in slavery? Think of the letter which our enemies have sent to the king—a false, hypocritical, deeply intriguing letter—and for what purpose? That we might be stopped in our laudable undertak - ing of building a house unto the name of the Lord.” Obadiah (AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENT)—”Excellent High Priest, I should deplore any disaster overtaking our noble and be - loved Prince. Yet is there not cause for rejoicing that we have among us one so strong, so powerful, so exalted in station and position who is still willing to step down from his high station and agree, yes offer, to undertake this really hazardous journey in order that he might in - tercede for his suffering people? Let us accept his offer; yes, I say, let us accept; and furthermore, let us take heart, for we may rest assured assured with confidence on the promise of God that He will not see the righteous forsaken.” Amos (AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENT)—”Excellent High Priest, information from those who have tried to traverse the plains makes one tremble. The plains east may be dangerous; of this there is little doubt. The fords of Jordan infested with Godless men; but our good friend, Prince Zerubbabel, relies on Jehovah, who never fails those who in sincerity serve Him. If successful in reaching the ear of the king, as I personally believe he will, it will mean much to Jerusalem; it will save our people and lift the yoke of slavery from us all. Haste is necessary and should this Council consent, as I earnestly hope it may, then I join with Companion Isaiah in his exhortation that a strong escort be given and proceed with our Noble Prince to the farthe~st distance possible to protect him; after that let us rely en - tirely on the guardianship of God.” The Excellent High Priest then says: “What say you, Compan - ions, do you now accept the generous offer of Zerubbabel?” Jewish Council answers in unison, “We do.” Then proceed with the ritual. Be it further resolved that, if used on an optional basis, it shall never be read. 175"}]
