It devel - oped from a system of twenty-five so-called “higher degrees” which flourished in France in the mid-Eigh - teenth Century and which came to be known as The Rite of Perfection. There is evidence that some of these degrees had an ancestral source also in England and Scotland. In 1740, the Ecossais (Scottish) Lodge—Parfaite Har - monie—was organized in Bordeaux, one of the oldest and most influential Masonic centers in France. The membership included Scottish and English Masons. The line of descent, beginning with Bordeaux, runs through the Sovereign Council Sublime Ecossais Mother Lodge in Paris, the Chapter of Clermont, Knights of the East, Emperors of the East and West, and the Rite of Seven Degiees of England. In 1761, the Masonic authorities in France granted a Patent to Stephen Morin of Bordeaux to carry the ad - vanced degrees across the sea to America. In or about 1763, Morin established these degrees in the West Indies. Within a few years, other degrees were added until the Rite had a ritual structure of thirty-three degrees—the first three being exemplified in a Symbolic Lodge. [1]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS Henry Andrew Francken (1720-1795), deputized by Stephen Morin, organized a Lodge of Perfection in Albany, New York, in 1767—the beginning of what was to become the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite in the United States During the Colonial period, Deputies appointed by Morin organized Masonic groups confer - ring the advanced degrees at points along the Atlantic seaboard. These groups were independent, without cen - tralized supervision or control, except to agree that their authority came from Jamaica and Stephen Morin. On May 31, 1801, a Supreme Council of The Thirty- third Degree for the United States of America was founded in Charleston, South Carolina, in an effort to unify competing groups and bring Masonic order out of chaos. Hence the motto—Ordo ab Chao Later added was the description, The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The full membership of that Supreme Council consisted of eleven Grand Inspectors General who signed the original Register Of 1802 Of these eleven, nine were born abroad but—in war and peace—had proved their loyalty to the United States. In religion, four were Jews, five were Protestants and two were Roman Catholics. The Scottish Rite was an effective catalyst welding these men into an intimate and fraternal fellowship. On August 5, 1813, Emanuel De La Motta, 330, of Savannah, Georgia, a distinguished Jewish merchant and philanthropist and Grand Treasurer General of the Su - preme Council at Charleston, organized—in the City of New York—”The Supreme Council of the United States of America.” Daniel Decius Tompkins, 330, afterward ~zzzif~mZZ HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 3 Vice President of the United States (1816-1824), was chosen Sovereign Grand Commander and John James Joseph Gourgas, 330, Grand Secretary General. In 1827, the territory of the Northern Masonic Juris - diction comprised the area now occupied by the follow - ing fifteen states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island~ Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, Nlichigan, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. The Northern and Southern Jurisdictions made slow progress in unifying the scattered degree-conferring groups and in standardizing rituals They were handi - capped by pride in their local organizations and leader - ship jealousies; by the Anti-Masonic agitation (]827-1840) which almost destroyed Freemasonry; by the War Be - tween the States (1861-1865), and by periods of depres - sion The process of unification in the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction was completed in the Union of 1867—the beginning of a new era of growth in numbers and influence. At the time of the Union of 1867, there were approxi - mately 4200 Scottish Rite Masons in the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction Membership was quite limited, and no at - tempt had been made to “popularize” either Masonry or the Scottish Rite. But inspired by the new spirit of harmo - ny which prevailed, membership began to increase rap - idly The year 1890 saw 15,000 members; 1910—61,000; 1920 —210,000; 1933—279,000. Then came the decline of the Thirties, followed by the tremendous upswing after World War II. ]n 1982, at the end of 215 years of Scottish"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"4 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 5 Rite Masonry, the membership in the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction was 496,000. There were 33 Valleys (a signif - icant coincidence) in 1867 at the time of the Union. Following the Union of 1867, Scottish Rite Masonry began to flourish. Old enmities and jealousies were erased and allowed to die. New Bodies in many new Valleys were instituted, a process that is still going on to this day. The conferral of degrees, which at best had been haphazard prior to 1867, was strengthened by revision of the ritual structures of the Rite. The Valleys started to build fine new temples dedicated to the work of the Rite. Splendid degree presentations, with elabo - rate scenery and costumes, became commonplace. Many noteworthy events have transpired in the last 100 years. An International Conference of Supreme Coun - cils was first held at Brussels, Belgium in 1907. This was followed by others at intervals throughout the years, and the 12th of such Conferences, at which Ill~ Stanley F. Maxwell, 330 presided as President, was held in Paris, France, in 1980. In ]917, a Jubilee Year celebration was held, honoring the 50th year of the Union of 1867. In 1967, centennial observances were held in all Valleys of the Rite. In 1975- 1976, a great many special programs were held relating to the 200th anniversary of the signing of The Declaration of Independence of our Country. One notable date in 1975, April 20, saw the opening and dedication of the Scottish Rite Masonic Museum and Librar’ of Our National Heritage in Lexington, Massa - chusetts, a gift to the nation by the Scottish Rite Masons of the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction in honor of our nation’s Bicentennial anniversary. A Declaration of Principles, setting forth the basic and fundamental philosophy of the Rite, was first adopted by the Supreme Council in 1923, reaffirmed in 1929 and 1934, and revised in 1971. Required to be read to each initiate, it succinctly sets forth the principles upon which all Scottish Rite Masons may agree. The Supreme Coun - cil believes that basic Masonic principles are changeless, but that the organization should be ever ready to meet the changing needs of the times. However, the Scottish Rite should be progressive, dynamic and attuned to the future, while firmly adhering to the Masonic tenets of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. With these aims in mind, the Supreme Council adopt - ed a Meritorious Service Award program in 1937, provid - ing for the recognition by Councils of Deliberation of those members who render outstanding service to the Rite. In 1938, the Gourgas Medal was established. It may be awarded only by the Supreme Council or by the Sovereign Grand Commander in recognition of notably distinguished service in the cause of Freemasonry, coun - try or humanity. In 1934, the Supreme Council established its program for Research in Dementia Praecox, now called Schizo - phrenia, with an appropriation of $15,000. This program has grown throughout the years, reaching an annual budget in excess of a half-million dollars. The Supreme Council’s pioneer work in this field focused national attention on the problem, and great strides in the relief of the worldwide scourge of mental illness have been made."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"7 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS The Supreme Council Education and Charity Fund and the Leon M. Abbott scholarship program came into existence through the suggestion of our late Sovereign Grand Commander, Ill~ Leon Martin Abbott, 330 who presided over our Supreme Council from 1921 until his death in 1932. Through his will, he bequeathed $50,000 to augment this fund, with the stipulation that some part of the income be used for college or university scholarships “for superior attainment or proficiency in the study of clean journalism.” Accordingly, the Supreme Council now awards yearly grants to schools of “journalism” and to schools of “diplomacy and international service.” The Scottish Rite Masonic Museum and Library, in Lexington, Massachusetts, is another benevolent endeav - or of our Supreme Council. Opened in 1975, this institu - tion has fulfilled a dream to give to the people of this great nation a gift that will, for decades to come, reflect the spirit of our people, as well as the events and institutions which have shaped this land of hope and freedom. The Museum and Library continues to demonstrate to the public our love of country, love of our flag and a firm belief in our democratic institutions as fundamental prin - ciples of all Masonic organizations.

While each Scottish Rite Body in a Valley is subordi - nate to the Supreme Council, it is co-ordinate in relation to every other Scottish Rite Body in the Valley Each Body operates under its own Dispensation and Charter and is the equal of every other Co-ordinate Body in rank, authority, rights and privileges The Presiding Officer of one Body does not outrank the Presiding Officer of another Co-ordinate Body; nor does the Presiding Officer of one Body have any authority over any other Co-ordi - nate Body. While each Co-ordinate Body is autonomous, it is of the utmost importance that all the Bodies in a Valley co-ordinate their efforts and cooperate fully in the estab - lishment and maintenance of a harmonious, unified and effective management of the Scottish Rite affairs in their Valley. It is, therefore, expected that each Valley having more than one Subordinate Body (by Joint Regulations adopted by each Subordinate Body) shall create a Coy- [8] I p erning Board or an Executive Committee to co-ordinate their activities. The Constitutions provide that the Presid - ing Officer of each Co-ordinate Body shall be a member of such Board or Committee. A majority of the members of such Board or Commit - tee may consist of one or more of the elected Officers of each Co-ordinate Body. The Constitutions provide that an Active Member of the Supreme Council may not hold the office of Trustee or any other office in a Subordinate Body of the Rite. While an Active Member, resident in the Valley, may serve as a consultant to the Governing Board or Execu - tive Committee of the Valley, such Active Member may not be a voting member of any such Board or Committee.

OATH OF FEALTY It is of the greatest importance that each Candidate and each Member fully understand that the Oath of Fealty is a symbol of the unity of the Scottish Rite. This Oath of Fealty protects the Body of the Rite against potentially unworthy Candidates and Members and as - sures the initiate that he is entering a legally constituted Scottish Rite Body, not one which is clandestine, illegal or spurious. Every Candidate for the Scottish Rite degrees in this jurisdiction signs the Oath of Fealty as an integral part of his application for such degrees. Every brother admitted from a jurisdiction other than the N M.J., by affiliation, must sign this Oath of Fealty which is an integral part of his petition for affiliation.

It encourages the worship of God in conformity with the dictates of individual conscience. It stands for truth and justice, liberty and enlightenment, fraternity and philanthropy. “This Supreme Council expects of its members strict obedience to the laws of the land, and respect for their country’s flag.

To their furtherance each Master Mason has pledged himself, and at the portal of the Scottish Rite has renewed that pledge. “This Supreme Council discountenances and re - jects any attempt by any international groups or confederations of Scottish Rite Supreme Councils to legislate for individual Supreme Councils. “Recognizing that principles unite men, that pro - grams sometimes divide them, and that the preserva - tion of unity of purpose and devotion to principle is essential to Freemasonry, the Supreme Council af - firms its continued adherence to that ancient and approved rule of Freemasonry which forbids the discussion within tyled doors of creeds, politics, oi other topics apt to excite personal animosities. “This Supreme Council further affirms its convic - tion that it is not only contrary to the fundamental principles of Freemasonry, but exceedingly danger - ous to its unity, strength, usefulness and welfare for Masonic Bodies in their official capacity to take formal action or attempt to exercise pressure or A 4; I"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS SUBORDINATE AND CO-ORDINATE BODIES 15 influence for or against any particular legislative project or proposal, or in any way to attempt to procure the election or appointment of Governmen - tal officials, whether executive, legislative, or judi - cial, or to influence them, whether or not members of the Fraternity, in the performance of their official duties.” DECLARATION FOR OPENING AND CLOSING The Constitutions require each Subordinate Body when meeting sepaiately to open and close its work by pronouncing the following Declaration: “To the glory of the Grand Architect of the Universe, in the name and under the auspices of the Supreme Council of Sovereign Grand Inspectors General of the Thirty-third and Last Degree of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the United States of America, and by virtue of the authority upon me conferred, I declare the works of (here mention the name of the Subordinate Body) opened (or closed, as the case may be).” The Constitutions also provide that when Co- ordinate Bodies are meeting jointly the Declaration shall be recited in full by the officer presiding over the meeting who shall add at the end of the Declaration “in joint session with the other Co-ordinate Bodies in the Valley of and be followed by the recitation by each other presiding officer of the following: “and I declare the works of opened (or closed, as the case may be).” or “Closing” a Subordinate Body of the Scottish Rite It should not be used in connection with the mere opening or closing of a ritualistic Degree. NOTE In the Ceremonial of open Installation of Officers (wheth - er separate or mint) the Body or Bodies must be opened before non-members are admitted and closed behind tyled doors after the ceremonies have been completed FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPUTY AND ACTIVE MEMBERS (1) It is imperative for every officer to acknowledge the authority of the Deputy of the Supreme Council in his State as specified in the Constitutions. As the official representative of the Supreme Council and of the Sover - eign Grand Commander, the Deputy is charged with the responsibility of requiring strict compliance with the Constitutions, laws, rules and regulations of the Supreme Council and with the decisions, edicts and orders of the Sovereign Grand Commander. The Deputy serves as the Illustrious Commander-in-Chief of the Council of Delib - eration of his State. In addition, he inspects the work of the Rite in the various Valleys, corrects any irregularities that he may discover, and sees that the official rituals are impressively exemplified as prescribed~ The Deputy is always available for counsel and for such visitations as are mutually convenient, but fraternal consideration should protect him from unreasonable de - mands. (2) Officers should be familiar with the status, duties and privileges of an Active Member of the Supreme Council.

He may attend meetings of the Governing Board or Executive Committee of a Valley. He does not represent his Valley or State in the Supreme Council but he does represent the Supreme Council in his State. He has the right to be received formally in all Bodies opened on any of the Degrees of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite in any State of this Jurisdiction and to inspect their work and practices. He shall report to the Deputy of that State any irregularity in ritual or business that comes to his attention. As a counselor he works in close cooperation with the Officers of the Bodies in his State and the Presiding Officers of such Bodies should avail themselves of his counsel and guidance. 1-JONORARY MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL As Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, the Honorary Members of the Supreme Council should be given formal recognition on ceremonial occasions. As distinguished members of the Supreme Council, they have the duty and responsibility to cooperate at all times with the Deputy and the other Active Members of the State, and with the Scottish Rite Officers of the local Valley in providing leadership, in conserving the interests of the Supreme Council, and in strengthening the influence of the Scottish Rite throughout their State. N4EETINGS The Constitutions provide that “each Subordinate Body shall meet at least four times annually” and that “special meetings may be called by the Presiding Officer ol any Body at any time he may deem necessary.” Notice of all meetings of a Subordinate Body must be given to the Members thereof “in such manner as shall be pre - scribed by the Rules and Regulations adopted by such Bodies.” The quorum required for the transaction of business by a particular Subordinate Body is set forth in the Constitutions. JOINT BUSINESS MEETINGS Joint business meetings, including balloting of all the Co-ordinate Bodies in a Valley, are provided for in the Constitutions. Joint meetings greatly facilitate the trans - action of business, and Valleys are encouraged to make use of them. Notices of joint meetings should bear the names of all of the Presiding Officers. The proceedings in connection with any joint meeting should be recorded in the Minute Book ol each Co-ordinate Body. The Presid - ing Officer of that Subordinate Body which is the Fiscal Agency may preside, or, by mutual arrangement, the Presiding Officers may serve in rotation. In opening the joint meeting, each Presiding Officer should declare his Subordinate Body open; this can be done readily by making the necessary adaptation of the Declaration for Opening and Closing. Care should be taken in a Joint Meeting to guard against the voting in a particular Subordinate Body by a Scottish Rite Mason who is not a member of that particu - lar Subordinate Body but is a member of another Subordi - nate Body participating in the Joint Meeting."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"18 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS SUBORDINATE AND CO-ORDINATE BOD]ES 19 The “election of officers must not be conducted in a joint meeting, but in a separate meeting of each Body concerned, held consecutively if on the same day.” CONDUCT OF MEETINGS The meetings should be opened promptly at the appointed time Nothing discourages attendance more than tardy openings. Do not permit the tardiness of an officer to delay the opening of meetings A substitute should be appointed to fill in The Presiding Officer is responsible for the conduct, deportment, finances, work and general performance of his Body, and for compliance with the written require - ments of the Constitutions of the Supreme Council, together with the unwritten requfrements of Masonic tradition and custom. All meetings should be conducted on a high plane and in a dignified manner. They should be conducted with dispatch, but not in haste. A general knowledge of Parliamentary Law is essen - tial, especially the forms of putting motions, directing debate, rules governing amendments and the like. A meeting need not be stilted or ultra-formal, but it is im - perative to maintain order and dignity. Robert’s Rules of Order shall be used and shall govern the conduct of all meetings. SUGGESTED ORDER OF BUSINESS The order of business at any regular or special meet - ing of a Subordinate or Co-ordinate Body shall be as follows: L (a) Call to order and opening Declaration (b) Invocation (c) Pledge of Allegiance to the flag (d) Reading and consideration of minutes (e) Action and/or voting on (1) remission of dues, (2) demits, (3) suspensions and (4) petitions (f) Consideration of all fiscal and committee reports (g) Unfinished business (h) New business (i) Closing Declaration REMISSION OF DUES Universally, no Masonic Body wants to suspend a member for non-payment of dues who is unable, because of financial or physical conditions, to pay such dues. It is urged that extreme care, discretion and as much investi - gation as practical (including periodic reviews) be ap - plied to all programs and policies relating to the remission of dues. Ideally, no member should be suspended for non-payment of dues when such payment would be a hardship. MEETINGS FOR INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS Every ceremony of installation of the elected or appointed officers should be performed in a formal, dignified and impressive manner. Every officer, elected or appointed, should be formally installed for the term of his office. Each Subordinate Body may elect to have its own separate installation, or all of the Co-ordinate Bodies elect to hold a Joint Installation. installations may be either “Open” or “Closed,” except in a State in which the II Ii."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"20 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS SUBORDINATE AND CO-ORDINATE BODIES 21 Council of Deliberation has prohibited open installations. If the installation is “Open,” the Body or Bodies must be opened before non-members are admitted and closed behind tyled doors after the ceremonies have been completed. NOTE Such opening should be well before the assembling and the closing well after the departure of the guests and then preferably in an adjoining apartment, so as not to interfere with the ceremonies If a separate installation is to be held for a single Subordinate Body, the Presiding Officer of that Body shall select, subject to the constitutional right of the Deputy to so act, an Installing Officer and a Marshal. If a Joint Installation is to be held for the several Co-ordinate Bodies, the several Presiding Officers shall select, subject to the Deputies’ prerogative, a Convening Officer to preside during the ceremony, a Master of Ceremonies, an Installing Officer and a Marshal. In either event, if an Active Member is available, he shall be invited to partici - pate. Each Presiding Officer should thoroughly familiarize himself with those provisions governing the installation of officers in Subordinate Bodies which are contained in the following: (a) The Constitutions (b) Book of “Forms and Ceremonials,” and (c) Book of “Ceremonial of Open Installation of Officers of Subordinate Bodies” (d) Manual for Officers The Secretary should keep a complete record of the Ceremony of Installation (whether it be separate or joint, open or closed), which should be incorporated in the Minutes of each separate Subordinate Body participating in the installation. TRADITIONAL MEETINGS Attention is called to the Constitutions relating to the observance of “Traditional Meetings” of Lodges of Per - fection, Councils of Princes of Jerusalem, and Chapters of Rose Croix. All Valleys are encouraged to consider the observation of these Traditional Meetings as they provide opportunities for promoting the interests of Scottish Rite and Freemasonry. OFFICERS No one except the Treasurer, Secretary, Hospitaler, Trustee and Tyler (or Sentinel), should hold office in more than one Co-ordinate Body at one and the same time. The same person shall not hold the offices of Secre - tary and Treasurer of a Subordinate Body at the same time. No one shall be elected as a Presiding Officer who has not previously served in one of the first three offices of some Body of the Rite unless such requirement is waived by the Deputy for the State. Appointments to office should be based upon such qualifications as: (a) Competence in leadership and initiative; (b) Industry; (c) Ready availability for performance of assign - ments;"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"22 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS SUBORDINATE AND CO-ORDINATE BODIES 23 (d) Dependability; and (e) A willingness to assume and discharge the duties of office and to cooperate fully with the Presid - ing Officer in carrying out his program of activ - ity. Advancement or promotion in the “line” should be based upon the same qualifications above enumerated plus a satisfactory record of attendance and performance in previous off~ces in the Body and not upon a “ladder promotion” policy or practice. Preferably no “line” for advancement purposes should start more than two or three stations from that of the Presiding Officer. Each officer, elected or appointed, should make a careful and thorough study of the Constitutions, especial - ly the Chapters entitled “Subordinate Bodies,” “Mem - bers,” “Candidates,” “Rituals,” “Forms” and “Regalia.” Each officer should be given, at the time of his election or appointment, certain specified duties and responsibilities which he should assume and discharge faithfully throughout his term of office. DUTIES OF OFFICERS “The post of honor is the post of responsibility.’ GENERAL To be elected or appointed to any office in a Scottish Rite Body is a distinct honor which carries with it responsibility. Those who accept these honors must be prepared and willing to undertake the duties and resp on - sibilities of their offices with the realization that some personal sacrifice will be necessary. It is not intended that holding office in a Scottish Rite Body should interfere with an officer’s vocation and his efforts to earn a livelihood. However, when any other cause, unless it be illness or death in the family, prevents his expected and required attendance at the meetings, rehearsals and reunions, he errs in expecting that his absence will be overlooked. If absence results from the pressure of one’s usual vocation, or from illness, the members are usually very considerate in forgiving the absence. However, if it is the result of lack of interest or conflict with what might be termed personal pleasure, continued approval cannot be expected Under such circumstances he should make way for another member who is more interested and willing to serve more faith - fully. Interest, attendance, punctuality and devotion to duty by all officers will inevitably result in success through cooperative and zealous teamwork. A portion of the obligation taken by an officer at his installation in a Scottish Rite Body is as follows: “I will seek diligently to acquire a due knowledge of the rituals, usages and administrative procedures of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite in this Jurisdic - tion, and especially to comply with the duties of my office. I will strive earnestly to promote the welfare of my Brethren and of our Rite, and to maintain peace and harmony in a spirit of courtesy and fraternal cooperation.” PRESIDING OFFICER5 The primary duties of a Presiding Officer of a Subor -"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"24 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS SUBORDINATE AND CO-ORDINATE BODIES 25 dinate Body are presciibed in the Constitutions which provide the following: Except as provided in the succeeding paragraph, “it shall be the duty of the Presiding Officer of a Subordinate Body to preside at all meetings thereof, appoint all committees, and be ex officio a member of the same with voting rights He shall discharge all the duties prescribed for him by the Constitutions and rituals of the Supreme Council and the usages and customs of the Rite; but the Presiding Officer of a Subordinate Body shall have and exercise no authority or control over any other Subordinate Body “In a Valley having a Council, Chapter and Con - sistory, or any one or more of them in addition to a Lodge of Perfection, joint regulations of such Bodies may provide for a Board of Officers or Executive Committee with power and authority to co-ordinate the activities of all the Subordinate Bodies in that Valley including the acquisition, management and control of all properties for the common good, the scheduling of degrees, the appointment of commit - tees, the fixing of budgets, the management of finances, and other appropriate common activities provided only that the Presiding Officer of each such Subordinate Body in such Valley shall be a member of such Board of Officers or Executive Committee” A Presiding Officer is required to give his assent to the following charges of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite: — to pay true allegiance and fealty to the Supreme Council, b — to support its Constitutions, Statutes, Orders and Decrees, — to agree not to engage in any plot or conspiracy against the civil government, — to obey the laws of our country, — to submit peacefully to the will of the majority, — to avoid disputes and quarrels, — to be impartial, upright and modest, — to refrain from all intemperance and excess, — to be faithful to his Brethren and courteous to all men, — to exercise hospitality, — to receive all duly accredited visitors, — to reject imposters, — to rebuke those who would seek to disturb peace and harmony, — to guard zealously the Charter of the Body over which he is called to preside, — to permit no one to receive any degree of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite unless he be a Master Mason in good standing and qualified in accordance with the Constitutions and Regula - tions of the Rite.

ELECTION RETURNS On or about March 15 of each year, forms in triplicate are sent to each Secretary. These should be carefully filled out giving full names of officers elected, with degrees and honors (330, 320, M.S.A., etc.) together with complete address and zip code numbers. It is also requested that the business and home telephone numbers of the Presiding Officers and Secretary be included. These are to be returned to the headquaiters office not later than ten days after the election. The original of this Election Return is to be mailed to the headquarters office, the duplicate to the Deputy for the State and the third copy is to be retained for the Secretary’s records. RITUAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER BOOKS On or about March 15 of each year, forms in duplicate for the reporting of Rituals will be mailed to each [28] Secretary. These forms are to be filled out from an actual inventory of books in his possession or substantiated by written receipts. It is strongly recommended that written receipts not be accepted as a “final” proof of possession of any particular book or books. Each holder of a book should be required to bring in such books for a physical check, at least once a year. If a book cannot be accounted for, it should be listed and marked as “missing”. RITUAL RECEIPTS When new rituals of any kind are mailed, there is a leceipt and a return envelope enclosed, which is to be returned to the headquarters office promptly. Usually, at the same time, request is made to return an older issue of the same degree by a specified date. Knowing that sometimes this particular degree may have alieady been scheduled for a presentation, such a deadline can be inconvenient. In such a case, the Secretary should write to headquarters requesting an extension of time for return of the old rituals. ANNUAL RETURNS Annually, the Data Piocessing Department will send to each Secretary a copy of his Valley Annual Returns, in triplicate, together with a bill for the amount due the Supreme Council These Returns should be carefully teviewed and verified with the Valley records to be sure membership figures are in agreement. The “cover” should include accurate information re - garding Stated Meetings of each Body. These “Stated"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"30 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS DUTIES OF SECRETARIES 31 Meetings” must correspond with the Rules and Regula - tions or By-Laws of your Valley and should be signed by the Secretary. With the Annual Returns there will be found a sepa - rate listing of plural memberships in the Valley (if any). These should be checked, as it is essential that headquar - ters be informed of the number of plural members, but they are not included in the final calculations. The per capita dues figure owed to the Supreme Council is paid by the first Body or Bodies (Primary Membership) which a man joined and wherein he still maintains a member - ship. The original copy of the Annual Returns (complete), signed by the Secretary together with payment specified, shall be returned to the Grand Secretary General no later than the 15th of July each year. The second copy goes to the Deputy for your State. It will be particularly helpful to the Grand Secietary General to receive the Returns as early as possible. ORDERS FOR CERTIFICATES AND DIPLOMAS Certificates The Constitutions provide that every Consistory shall provide, without charge, to each candidate receiving the Thirty-second Degree, a certificate, as evidence of initia - tion to this degree in that Body. At the close of each conferral of the Thirty-second Degree, an order is to be placed with the headquarters office for the certificates for each new Sublime Prince. A form is furnished for this order. Follow the directions on the form explicitly. They must be filled out with full names and other detailed information as the instructions indicate. In order to avoid errors and delays, it is re - quested that the Secretaries indicate, following the name (where an “odd” spelling occurs) that the spelling of names has been checked. Where a member may not have a “middle” name, place this designation after the name— N•MN. The Secretary is also requested to indicate on the order form, where courtesy work may have been ob - tained, and which will result in a different date from the regular “Class” date, the reason for the change in date. It is further requested that the certificate order forms be typed to distinguish such names as may begin with N4c, Mac, uppei and lower case, et cetera. When a member affiliates with a Consistory, a certifi - cate should also be ordered giving the information as specified in the preceding paragraph including the ol-igi - nal date the member ieceived the Thirty-second Degree, the Valley where he received the degree and the date of affiliation in your Valley. Diplomas Diplomas (for framing purposes) are also available at the prevailing cost price. If these are requested, it is necessary to furnish the same information as provided for a certificate. Checks drawn to the order of the Supreme Council, A•A.S R, must accompany orders for either certificates and/or diplomas.

Post cards for this purpose will be furnished on request. Following receipt of such notification, the headquarters office will request a memorial, not ovei 300 words in length, containing such information as to whether or not a widow survives, time and place of memorial services and place of burial. This is vital statistical material that may be needed for future generations. It has been particularly helpful in genealogical studies and for histories. The memoiial should be prepared and mailed promptly. There is usually an allowance of 45 days. An illuminated copy of the memorial in purple and gold, together with a personal letter from the Sovereign Grand Commander, will be sent to the surviving widow, if any. MERITORIOUS SERVICE AWARD The Supreme Council annually requests from the Secretary of the Council of Deliberation a list of the newly-elected Meritorious Service Awardees.

WHAT IS THE SCOTTISH RITE? This pamphlet was initiated by the Committee on Masonic Education and Program Development to convey to all new initiates in our Rite a brief summary of some of the important bits of information relating to the Supreme Council and the Rite. Most importantly, the booklet puts into the hands of each initiate a copy of our Oath of Fealty and the Declaration of Principles.

If the Deputy for the State is present, he shall be asked for instructions as to protocol, and shall prescribe it after being informed of those present. In general, the procedure shall be as follows: (a) If an Active Member of the Supreme Council resident in the Valley is present, he shall be ieceived first, and shall receive the Deputy, if present, who shall then proceed as he sees fit.

It is important that formal dignity be maintained. Introductions should be brief; no biographical data, no fulsome compliments. It is sufficient to say, “I have the honor to present (Give name and Masonic title) Do not use cliche present to you and through you.” In presenting the Sovereign Grand Commander, do not rehearse the full corporate title of the Jurisdiction used in the Official Declaration. “Ill. 330 Sovereign Grand Commander,” is preferable. 7.

It is recommended that no speaker, regardless of Masonic rank, shall speak immediately following the conferring of a degree. 9. At a dinner meeting or a Masonic gathering, other than one at which a degree is conferred, speeches other than that of the principal speaker shall be limited so that the program shall not become excessively long. Only the senior Masonic Offi - cers present should be given the opportunity to speak. Other introductions should be held to a minimum, and group introductions used when - ever possible. The program should end with the principal address. 10 When a guest speaker is invited to visit a Valley, the Committee in charge should advise him that the Valley will provide transportation and other expenses Adequate hotel accommodations should be provided by the Valley or Council of Deliber - ation, if involved. 11. A universal fault with most banquets and meet - ings is their extended length; too many introduc - tions and re-introductions, many of the same persons, not enough group presentations to re - duce individual applause and “word of greeting” 4 expanded to a talk of several minutes. A good Master of Ceremonies or Presiding Officer can be of great benefit in controlling the program. 12. Common courtesy demands that a Valley arrange its program in a manner that provides a guest speaker with an audience that is not enervated by extended proceedings prior to his introduction or by the lateness of the hour.

The second highest ranking officer is seated at the left of the Presiding Officer. All others, including distinguished guests, are placed in order alternating right and left. Seating is facilitated when place cards are used.

The integrity of the Ritual structure is of vital significance because the philosophy of the Scottish Rite, its historic message and its practical lessons are drama - tized in its Rituals. It is the duty of the Officers to [50] guarantee the integrity of the Ritual structure by guard - ing it from unauthorized changes. All Officers must, therefore, know the Rituals for which they are morally and legally responsible. 2. Subordinate Bodies are prohibited from conferring degrees, except in conformity with the Rules and Rituals authorized by the Regulations of the Supreme Council and in conformity with the Supreme Council. “The Deputy for the State may suspend from office any Officer of a Subordinate Body who shall use, or cause to be used, any unauthorized Ritual of any degree of the Rite.” 3. These Constitutional provisions define the respon - sibility of Officers for guarding against unauthorized innovations in the Ritual. Liberty is granted to Valleys to adapt suggested setting changes, costumes and dramatic action to local conditions; but omissions, innovations and changes in Ritual text or sequence are not permitted unless in accordance with the Rules and Regulations approved by the Supreme Council. Such Rules require that the following steps shall be taken: (a) Any officer of the Rite who has an innovation or revision (hereinafter “Changes”) he would like to see incorporated in any Degree must submit his propo - sal in writing to the proper Valley authority, i.e, degree committee, degree director, executive com - mittee, etc. (hereinafter “Valley”).

The use of costumes, stage settings and parapher - nalia belonging to a Valley is governed by the Constitu - tions which read as follows: “With the approval of the Sovereign Grand Com - mander or the Deputy for the State, costumes, stage settings and other paraphernalia belonging to a Val - ley may be used in the presentation of plays or other entertainments, whether open to the public or not, sponsored or permitted by the Valley a and may be photographed for publicity purposes, provided, how - ever, that the degree or ritualistic use of such items shall not be disclosed and that no costume or degree character representing a member of the clergy may be so used without the specific approval of the Sovereign Grand Commander.” A RITUAL PROGRAM The Ritual of the degrees has always been the heart and soul of the Rite. No single phase of Scottish Rite has received more attention than the degree structure, and each degree is under constant study in an attempt to assure a modern, dynamic presentation of the philosophy of the Rite. There are 29 Scottish Rite Degrees, 4o~32a inclusive, which may be conferred by a Valley. The number of Degrees witnessed by each Class becomes a matter of importance. Ritualistic programs should be studied with care so that a maximum number of Degrees may be exemplified. Mandatory degrees in each Body are pro - vided by the Constitutions as follows. Unless specifically approved and authorized by the Deputy for the State, Lodges of Perfection shall exempli - fy for all classes of candidates the Fourteenth and one other Lodge of Perfection Degree; Councils of Princes of Jerusalem, the Fifteenth or the Sixteenth Degree; Chap - ters of Rose Croix, the Seventeenth and the Eighteenth Degrees; and Consistories, the Thirty.second Degree, and one other Consistorial Degree; each in its complete form, including ceremonial and allegorical sections pro - vided, however, that where several degrees in the Lodge of Perfection, the Council of Princes of Jerusalem, or the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"54 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS RITUALS 55 Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret are being exemplified at the same session, the Ceremonial sections of the degrees may be omitted and the presenta - tion of each degree start with the dramatic section except, 1.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CASTING The need for workers in all areas of Scottish Rite Masonry is great, and the recruitment of qualified men presents a wonderful opportunity to stimulate interest in the Valley. The following hints may be helpful in casting: I. Casting Committees should be used to facilitate increased membership participation. 2 Complete questionnaires from all new members should be obtained in order to determine their skills, availability and interests Similar questionnaires should be obtained from those who are already members 3. Alternate casts should be developed and used 4 Degree workers should not be retained too long in one part. This refers particularly to the major charac - ters. 5. Critique Committees should be used after degree exemplification to evaluate and improve results. 6. Minor characters should be encouraged by stre ss - ing their importance in the complete success of the exemplification of the degree. 7. Physical requirements are important. Fit the man to the character and assist him to “be” the part. 8. Programs of dramatic and speech training should be instituted and maintained. 9. Mistakes in casting should be corrected as soon as possible. 10. Sincerity of effort and enthusiasm are essential qualifications for a successful degree worker. 11. Attendance at rehearsals is most important REGALIA, COSTUMES AND PARAPHERNALIA Consult the “Regalia” section of the Constitutions for information concerning the Scottish Rite emblems, jew - els, chain collars, caps and Consistory uniforms. Costumes, properties and stage settings are suggested, —in general terrns,—in the Director’s notes in the Ritual of each Degree. The 1969 Manual for Directors of Work will also prove helpful."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"COVER OBLIGATIONS 57 VII COVER OBLIGATIONS AND COMMUNICATION OF DEGREES Presiding Officers will urge the members of a given Class to return, from time to time, to witness the exempli - fication of degrees which they have not seen.

The following statements by the Presiding Officer, or someone designated by him, meet the mandatory require - ments for communication of the degrees for each of the bodies. EXEMPLAR An Exemplar, representing the Class, may—on behalf of the Candidates—assume the Obligation in any Body of the Scottish Rite. When an Exemplar is used, the follow - ing affirmation of consent must be given: “Do you and each of you consent that in the degrees about to be conferred upon you, an Exem - plar shall be chosen to represent you, to speak for you when necessary, to answer for you such ques - tions as you may not be able to answer for your - selves, to assume for you the necessary vows, and that such answers made, engagements entered into and vows assumed, will be by you understood and accepted as your own answers, promises and vows?” Upon receiving an affirmative answer, the Master of Ceremonies will place the candidate at the altar to assume the cover obligation.

LODGE OF PERFECTION Cover Obligation 40140 inclusive I promise on my word of honor as a Freemason and in the presence of Almighty God, that I will not reveal any of the degrees from the Fourth to the Fourteenth, inclusive, which I am about to receive, or in which I may hereafter be instructed, to any person or persons not lawfully entitled to the same. I furthermore promise that I will always evidence and express a Love of God in all things that I do, and that I will ever strive onward toward perfection. I furthermore promise that I will acknowledge the authority and obey the laws and decrees of the Supreme Council of Sovereign Grand Inspectors General of the Thirty-third and Last Degree of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the United States of America.

LODGE OF PERFECTION Communication (If the Prologue or Ceremonial Section of the 40 is to he given, the next two paragraphs should be omitted and the third paragraph must be read The Ineffable Degrees, from the Fourth to the Four. teenth inclusive, are conferred in a Lodge of Perfection. They are called “Ineffable” because they are concerned with the ineffable or unutterable Name of God and with man’s eager quest for the true Name. In these eleven degrees there is a profound unveiling of the character and purposes of God—”that high and holy One who inhabits eternity but dwells with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.” In formal ritual and in drama, ten of these degrees, based upon legends of the Solomonic era, elaborate the teachings of Symbolic Freemasonry and apply them to practical situations which are faced in everyday life. The Fourteenth Degree summarizes what has been taught and is a moral and philosophical climax. Important practical lessons are taught in the eleven Ineffable Degrees:—secrecy and silence in all confiden - tial relationships; respect for a brother’s memory; the duty of healing dissensions; justice and mercy in judging others; fair dealing in business by management and labor; the peril of excessive zeal even in a good cause; the honest collection of taxes based upon a just assessment to build to the greater glory of God; the mastery of difficul - ties and dangers in our progress toward Perfection; the honor of Freemasonry is in the keeping of those who seek Perfection in character and who reverence the Ineffable Name of God. COUNCIL OF PRINCES OF JERUSALEM Cover Obligation 150 and 16~ I in the presence of Almighty God and these brethren around me assembled, do hereby obligate myself never to reveal the secrets of the degree of Knight of the East or Sword, and of the degree of Prince of Jerusalem, to anyone of an inferior degree, nor to any person not lawfully qualified to receive the same, or who has not been regularly invested, in a constitutional manner, with all the Symbolic and Ineffable Degrees of Freemasonry, from Entered Apprentice to that of Grand Elect Mason inclusive. I furthermore promise that a philosophy of Truth will prevail in all of my dealings with my brethren and in my daily life. You will all repeat after me— And may Almighty God aid and assist me to keep this solemn vow. Amen.

They deal with persons and events connected with the end of the Babylonian Captivity of Israel, the return of some of the captives of Jerusalem, and the rebuilding of the Temple. In the Fifteenth Degree, KNIGHT OF THE EAST OR SWORD, Zerubbabel, a Jewish captive, wins the favor of King Cyrus and the release of the Jews from captivity. Years later, in the Sixteenth Degree, PRINCE OF JERUSALEM, Zerubabbel returns to Babylon to plead with King Darius for military protection against the enemies of Israel and for more generous assistance in the rebuilding of the Temple His skill in debate and his courage and integrity inspire Darius to grant his petitions. These degrees, dramatically portrayed, teach loyalty to conviction in the face of temptation, fidelity to duty in spite of hardships, and a devotion to Truth which is mighty above all things and which ultimately must pre - vail in the councils of mankind. CHAPTER OF ROSE CROIX Cover Obligation promise, on my word of honor and the faith of an honest man and Mason, and swear by my previous Masonic obligations never to reveal the secret mysteries of the Degree of Knight of the East and West, and of the Degree of Knight of the Eagle and Pelican, under the title of Rose Croix of Herodom, to any person in the world not lawfully entitled to the same. I furthermore promise to make the New Law which advocates Love for one another a part of my everyday existence and will endeavor to convince others to prac - tice this virtue. You will all repeat after me— And may Almighty God, help, maintain, and keep me steadfast in the strict fulfillment of this my solemn obligation. Amen. CHAPTER OF ROSE CROIX Communication The Chapter of Rose Croix—the spiritual center of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite—confers two Philo - sophical Degrees. The historical setting of these degrees is within the Christian era but without any prescribed date. Their message is universal; their fellowship may include all worshippers of the One God whatever their nation, race or creed. The Seventeenth Degree—KNIGHT OF THE EAST AND WEST— (If the Prologue of the J70 is given, omit this section.) dramatizes the age-long search for the Lost Word only to find that it is concealed in a Closed Book, sealed with seven seals. No man is worthy to open the Book until he discovers the New Law. The degree inspires the hope that Truth will dawn at last and that the worship of the One true and living God will spread from East to West. In the Eighteenth Degree—KNIGHT OF THE ROSE CROIX OF HERODOM— (If the Prologue of the 180 is given, omit this section) a Knight of the East and West learns that by the aid of three guiding virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity, he may discover the New Law of Love.

CONSISTORY OF SUBLIME PRINCES OF THE ROYAL SECRET Communication Fourteen “Traditional” and “Chivalric” Degrees— from the Nineteenth to the Thirty-second, inclusive,—are I’ if COVER OBLIGATIONS 63 conferred in a Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret. Each Degree dramatizes its own unique and independent message and applies it to a familiar life situation. In the area of morals, certain Consistory Degrees teach the ultimate victory of good over evil, the dignity of laboi, the sacredness of duty and unselfish service as the test of one’s religious professions. A leader of men is taught that he must be righteous if he aspires to influence others and that he should listen, with open mind, to the lessons of the ages. In social relations, the Consistory teaches that tolera - tion is respect for the opinions and religious convictions of others; that he who judges others must himself be above reproach; that it is noble to forgive but ignoble to seek revenge; that a Freemason who commits a felony will not be shielded by his brethren; and that he should have faith in himself, in his fellowman, and in God. In the area of national affairs, the Consistory holds firmly to the separation of Church and State and teaches that treason is a crime over which Freemasonry casts no mantle of charity. It proclaims that the crowning glory, in any human life, is that sacrificial love which impels one to lay down his life for a friend.

Accordingly, the following Membership Program has been established and is recommended for implementa - tion in each Valley. This program includes suggestions for encouraging responsibility, assistance, organizational charts, training of volunteers, working tools, reunion organization, co - operation with partial Valleys, rewards and maintenance of membership. The size of a Valley does not cause the success or failure of any membership program. It is the interest, ambition and ingenuity of Valley leadership which dic - tates success or failure. RESPONSIBILITY It shall be the responsibility of the Presiding Officers of each Valley to organize, supervise and assist in every way possible the continuing Membership Program. It is fully expected that Presiding Officers will appoint a Membership Chairman and an Assistant Membership Chairman who will be directly responsible for the opera- [64] tion of the Membership Program. While the Membership Chairman is responsible for the program, all Valley Officers should offer and provide all possible assistance. ASSISTANCE—Blue Lodge Representatives There should be in each Valley an organization con - sisting of Blue Lodge Representatives appointed by the Membership Chairman with the approval of the Presid - ing Officers. It is the function of a Blue Lodge Representative to be an active part of the membership committee. It is ex - pected that he will be a man who can make recommenda - tions as to workers within his Blue Lodge who will be of assistance to the membership committee. It is suggested that there be at least two meetings a year for the Blue Lodge Representatives with the Membership Chairman present. SCOTTISH RITE CLUBS Scottish Rite Clubs should be organized throughout the Valley and be used to provide Scottish Rite activities in their various areas. These Clubs will serve as member - ship inducements and should, when possible, assist the various Lodge and area Membership Chairmen in provid - ing a vehicle for membership acquisition meetings. ORGANIZATION The membership organization for each Valley should be headed by a Chairman who should hold office for a period of two years. He will be aided by an Assistant Chairman who may well become the Chairman for the following two years. I"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"66 67 MEMBERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM MANUAL FOR OFFJCERS A diagram of the membership organization follows: MEMBERSHIP COMMITTEE ~II / ‘I The Chairman and Assistant Chairman will secure area leaders, together with assistant area leaders, to provide coverage for each geographical area. Each lead - er’s area will include those Blue Lodges which are in a close geographical and interest area. No leader should be responsible for more than five Blue Lodges. There should be appointed by each area leader a Blue Lodge leader whose responsibility will be to secure membership workers. The number of Blue Lodge mem - bership workers will depend upon the number o1 pro - spects—those not already Scottish Rite members—within the Blue Lodge. There should be at least one Blue Lodge worker for every ten prospects. The Membership Chaii man should be replaced at the end of two years. It is recommended that all workers prepare and train their replacements and that every worker be given an opportunity to be replaced in his job before he becomes so bored with the assignment that he becomes indfective. WORKING TOOLS Prospect Cards will be prepared for all workers They will be designed as follows: The card will be approxi - mately three by six, perforated in the middle, carrying the name and address of the prospect, together with a blank space entitled “remarks.” The worker will enter the results of his call and sign his name. These cards are prepared by the Valley from sources which will be discussed later.

As cards are given to the various workers, they will be separated. The Lodge leader will keep the half of the card with the name of the worker to whom it was assigned. Using these cards, he will be able to determine who has specific cards, and after they have been processed, whatever results were obtained. Each worker must return every card given to him, whether or not calls were made, but with comments on it as to the results of calls actually made. If the call indicates that there is no possible way of securing the prospect as a member in the future, the card will be so marked and not given out again. On the other hand, if the card indicates that the prospect will be interested at some time in the future, it should then be given back for follow-up. RECORDS It is essential that the Lodge leader keep a record of cards given to worl~ers and the results of the calls so that he, in turn, may give them back to his Area leader who will return them to the Membership Chairman. SOURCE There are several sources of names of Masons in a Valley. One such source is the mailing list of the Grand Lodge, if available, and if secured by permission of the Grand Master. These lists must be reviewed by the Valley to find those members of Masonry who are not members of the Scottish Rite and are therefore prospects for member - ship A list of Scottish Rite members, by Blue Lodge, is available from the Supreme Council headquarters. EDUCATION It is imperative that workers be given a short synopsis of the meaning of Scottish Rite and the reasons for joining. The “Facts of Scottish Rite” booklet as prepared by the Supreme Council should be made available for every prospect This booldet can be procured from the Supreme Council headquarters. TRAINING No membership worker should be sent out without adequate training. He should be inspired to achieve a ~1"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"70 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS successful membership drive. It is recommended that training sessions be held. Every attempt should be made to have every worker at an organizational meeting regardless of the number of years that he has been involved. Enthusiasm needs to be rekindled in most people REWARDS Any top line signer of a Valley who secures a predeter - mined number of new members should receive a member - ship medallion, pin or other suitable award, and for each additional predetermined number of new members se - cured, there should be additional recognition. The recognition of such top line signers should tal~e place at each Reunion or other special occasion. MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP Any request for a demit, except for the purpose of transferring membership to another Valley, should be personally investigated to see if there is any possibility of saving the membership. Every effort should be made to maintain the member - ship of those who have fallen behind in their dues. If it is ascertained upon personal investigation that the delin - quency is caused by financial problems, appropriate arrangements for assistance should be made. Ix MUSIC IN THE RITE Music, “the universal language of mankind,” is a means to an end in degree portrayal. It should serve to sharpen the image of the lesson being taught and provide the atmosphere or mood which helps the drama to come alive It can add another dimension to the story being told or expressed in action. It can stir the current of history, heightening the color of the scene. To be effec - tive, music must say the right thing in the right place at the right time. Ritualistic music should relate to the historical period, to the moral teaching and to the total concept of the degree. Unity should be sought and maintained. Universality is a basic principle of the Scottish Rite. Consequently, care must be taken that the music used in degree exemplification is not identified exclusively with a particular form of divine worship and that it is not offensive to a particular creed. It is recommended that the musical program be selected in a conference that includes the Presiding Officers of the Scottish Rite Bodies, the director of work, the organist and the choral director.

SUPREME COUNCIL FINANCIAL AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS IN WHICH VALLEYS MAY PARTICIPATE THE SCOTTISH RITE PENSION PLAN In 1962 the Supreme Council adopted a Pension Plan for its employees. Later the Plan was amended so as to make it available to local Valleys. The original Pension Plan and each Amendment have been approved by the Internal Revenue Service. Pension benefits are based on a formula which will approach but will not exceed 50~ of salary, including Social Security payments. Each participant is also cov - ered by a group life insurance plan. Normal retirement age is 65 or ten years from the date of entry into the Plan but not later than age 70. If, for instance, an employee entered the Plan at age 58, his normal retirement age would be 68. To be eligible for the full benefits under this Pension Plan, the Valley employee must have completed 10 years of employment with the Valley. After 5 years of employment, the participant is vested for 50~ of the benefits and then 10~ per year thereafter until 10 years have been completed. Because of the greater number of participants in - volved in a Pension Plan which is available to all Valleys, the cost to a local Valley for its participation in this [73]"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"74 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS FINANCIAL AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS 75 Pension Plan is less than such Valley would incur in establishing or maintaining its own individual pension plan having similar benefits. Complete details of this Pension Plan may be obtained by writing directly to the Supreme Council office in Lexington, Massachusetts. SCOTTISH RITE INVESTMENT TRUST An Investment Trust has been established by the Supreme Council for the benefit of the Scottish Rite Bodies in the N.M.J. Participation by a Valley in this Investment Trust is entirely voluntary. The funds of the Investment Trust are administered by the same group of trustees which administer the invested funds of the Supreme Council. These trustees meet quarterly with the representatives of the Depository Bank in which the funds are deposited. At these quarterly meetings the current investments, the general financial situation and the general economic picture are carefully reviewed The principal advantage to be derived by a Valley through participation in such Investment Trust lies in the fact that the management of the Investment Funds is entrusted to competent, reliable and knowledgeable men who are constantly engaged in the handling of securities and who make it their business to keep abreast of current marl~et conditions and indicators. The Investment Trust Fund is in two parts. First, the “Fixed Income” portion which emphasizes income espe - cially and second, the “Equity” portion which aims toward appreciation as well as income. ‘I A Valley may select one or both of these options as they may choose. The Trust Fund is valued four (4) times each year— on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. Local Valley participation in this Investment Trust may be effected by depositing securities or cash on any of these four dates in the Depository Bank; these securities are then valued and pooled with the other assets of the Fund. The annual carrying charge of the Depository Bank is, because of the volume involved, at the lowest rate charged by the Bank commensurate with the service rendered. The Trustees are empowered to sell or retain any or all of the securities deposited in the Depository Bank by a particular Valley, but each participating Valley partici - pates in the entire diversified list of securities in the Investment Trust. A minimum of $10,000.00 in cash or securities is required for initial participation. Quarterly reports showing the book and market val - ues of the Fund, and the value of the holdings of each participant, are distributed to each participating Valley. Complete details of this Investment Trust may be obtained by writing directly to the Supreme Council office in Lexington, Massachusetts. SCOTTISH RITE INSURANCE PROGRAM The Supreme Council has established a broad multi - ple-risk insurance program which is available to all Valleys on a voluntary basis. ~~~1"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"76 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS This program is comprehensive in character and very flexible. It makes available to any Valley any or all kinds of property, casualty and liability coverage, including automobile coverage, fire and extended coverage on buildings, burglary, fidelity and surety losses, workmen s compensation, and coverage for various other types of protection that may be needed by a Valley. The coverage afforded under this program is more complete, and in certain areas, broader, than is usually obtainable. The insuring company is a very large, nation - ally known company, with local service available in all areas. A Valley has the privilege of naming its own local insurance agency to act as the local agent in the servicing of the Valley’s program. By reason of the participation in this program of a number of Valleys, as well as the Supreme Council itself, the Scottish Rite insurance program is able to provide improved and broader protection at a low cost. As additional Valleys participate in this program the premi - um cost will likely be reduced Each Valley is eligible to participate in this program for a part or all of its insurance needs. Complete details of this multiple-risk insurance pro - gram may be obtained without cost or obligation by writing directly to the Supreme Council office in Lexing - ton, Massachusetts. A, XI BENE VOLE NCES The Supreme Council from its inception has been keenly conscious that benevolence is a primary function of Freemasonry, and always has been active in that field. However, its greatest impetus in that area came during the administration of Ill.. Melvin Maynard Johnson, 330, Sovereign Grand Commander, 1933-1953. During the Summer of 1933 he had been told of the intention of his associates on the Supreme Council to elect him as Com - mander at their meeting in September of that year. Consequently, he had the summer months to reflect on the responsibilities he would face on assuming that office. Clearly much of his thinking during these months was concerned with Masonic Benevolence as he devoted the major part of his acceptance address to that sub ject— 1933 Proceedings, pages 72-79. In summary he said this: “We talk much in our ritual and at our meetings along altruistic lines and we urge eleemosynary endeavor. Let us show by our acts that our words are not vacuous verbiage. We are financially able, our - selves, to do that which we preach. Let us prove by our own deeds that we mean what we say. Let us demonstrate this by acts and not merely by words, by doing and not merely by preaching, by example and not merely by rhetoric. Let us be practical and not merely didactic. It is certainly true that ‘actions speak louder than words.’” 1771"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"78 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS BENEVOLENCES 79 It was under his leadership that research in the field of schizophrenia was undertaken, starting in 1934, and the Benevolent Foundation was set up in 1941. BENEVOLENT FOUNDAT[ON The Benevolent Foundation was established formally by an amendment to the Supreme Council Constitutions in 1941. These provisions appear in the present Constitu - tions which provide among other things that: “The principal shall be kept invested and the net income applied to such religious, charitable, scientif - ic or educational purposes as the Supreme Council shall direct from time to time. * * * * * * * * “All of the assets and earnings of the said Founda - tion shall be used only for the purposes hereinabove set out and no amendment of this Article shall be valid to the extent that it purports to divert any of such assets or earnings to any other purpose. Starting in 1955 and under the leadership of Sovereign Grand Commander, Ill.. George E. Bushnell, 330, and Ill 7 Richard A. Kern, 330, then a member of the Commit - tee on Benevolences and subsequently its Chairman, an annual solicitation has been undei taken among all mem - bers of the Scottish Rite in our Jurisdiction to build up this Benevolent Foundation to significant proportions. This annual solicitation is an established part of our Supreme Council program. Through it, together with substantial gifts by will from many of our members, the capital of the Foundation has grown at an appreciable rate. Research that seeks to find the cause or causes and develop a cure for schizophrenia is still the major project of the Foundation. The Supreme Council has been cited many times foi the excellence of this research program. Although the secrets of the cause and cure of this terrible disease still elude us, great progress has been made. When these secrets are discovered, humanity will be relieved of one of the greatest curses that has ever afflicted it. The foresight of Past Commander Johnson and the dedication of Ill.’. Brother Kern one day may well be hailed as leading to one of the world’s great achievements in the field of mental health. SCOTT[SH RITE MASONIC MUSEUM AND LIBRARY In 1972, Ill. ~.George A. Newbury, 330, the then Sover - eign Grand Commander, originated the thought that our Rite should establish a Museum and Library on the Headquarters grounds in Lexington, Massachusetts, as a gift to the nation on the occasion of the Bicentennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which would be celebrated in 1976. The idea was approved by the Supreme Council and ground was broken on February 5, 1973; the building was dedicated on April 20, 1975, as the 200th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord was observed. The Museum and Library was dedicated “to America, her History; her Patriots and Builders; her Ideals and to Faith in her future.” The funding for this project is by subscription from the membership and assistance by the Supreme Council."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"80 MANUAL FOR OFFICERS i BENEVOLENCES 81 What remains to be done is to establish an adequate Endowment Fund for maintenance and operating ex - penses. Donations from the membership, as well as grants, bequests and trusts are earnestly solicited The Museum of Our National Heritage is truly a showcase for Freemasonry. EDUCATION AND CHARITY FUND In ~922 at the suggestion of Ill~ Leon M. Abbott, 330, Sovereign Giand Commander of this Supreme Council from 192k to 1932, a college scholarship program was inaugurated with an initial appropriation of $50,000.00 from funds of the Supreme Council (1922 Proceedings, page 40). This later became known as the “Education and Charity Fund.” By his Last Will and Testament Illi . Brother Abbott, 330 bequeathed $50,000.00 plus a share in the residue of his Estate to this Education and Charity Fund with the Proviso: “It is my desire that some part of this income of said fund shall be used for college or university scholarships for superior attainment or proficiency in the study of clean journalism, or for prizes or awards to college students for the best essays calculated to encourage and inspire the highest type and standard of true American citizenship.” Subsequent gifts from our Valleys and interested members and friends are adding substantially to this fund. THE CHARLES LEVI WOODBURY CHARITY FUND The first step toward the setting up of a formal and continuing benevolent and charitable program in our Supreme Council occurred in 1900 when Ill; .Charles Levi Woodbury, 330 made a modest bequest in his Last Will and Testament. Since 1934 the income from this Fund has been appropriated annually to the Grand Almoner of the Supreme Council for charitable purposes. DONATIONS AND BEQUESTS Donations by individuals or Scottish Rite Bodies to the Benevolences of the Supreme Council should be encouraged. They may be made by direct donations or by bequests in wills, to any of the above three funds. The proper wording for bequests is as follows: Scottish Rite Masonic Museum and Library, Inc., a Massachusetts Corporation, having its headquarters in Lexington, Massachusetts. Benevolent Foundation of the Trustees of the Su - pieme Council, Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Free - masonry, a N4assachusetts Corporation having its head - quarters in Lexington, N4assachusetts.

FUNERAL SERVICE The Supreme Council has no authorized funeral ser - vice THE DOUBLE-HEADED EAGLE “‘The Dougle-Headed Eagle of Lagash is the oldest Royal Crest in the world. . . . No heraldic beating, no emblematic device of today can boast of such antiquity. It was in use a thousand years before the Exodus from Egypt and more than 2,000 years before the building of King Solomon’s Temple. “‘As time rolled on, it passed from the Sumerians to the men of Akkad, from the men of Akkad to the Hittites, from the denizens of Asia Minor to the Seljukian Sultans from whom it was brought by the Crusaders to the Emperors of the East and West, whose successors were the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs.’ MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS 85 “This historical statement by William John Chetwode Crawley, distinguished Irish scholar, histoijan and Freemason (1844-1915) was published in the 19] 1 Transactions of Ars Quatuor Coronati Lodge No 2076 of London (Vol 24, pp 21-24) It was based upon records of archaeological researches by the eminent Assyriologist, M Thureau-Gangin, whose excavations in Telloh—the ancient Lagash.—brought to light the Storm-Bird which is now the emblem of the Scottish Bite The Lagash records are in the Louvre in Paiis (Zeitschrift fur Ass yriologie, 1904) “In more recent excavations, the city-emblem of La- gash was disclosed also as a lion-headed eagle sinl~ing his claws into the bodies of two lions standing back to back. This is evidently a variant of the other eagle symbol. (Everyday Life in Ancient Times, 1951, pp~ 34-35) “The city of Lagash in Sumer in southern Babylonia, between the Euphrates and the Tigris and near the modern Shatra in Iraq, had a calendar of twelve lunar months, a system of weights and measures, a banking and accounting system and was a center of art, literature, military and political power 5,000 years before Christ “In 102 B.C , the Roman Consul Marius decreed that the eagle be displayed as a symbol of imperial Rome Later, as a world-power, Rome used the double-headed eagle, one head facing East and the other facing West, symbolizing the universality and unity of the Empire. The Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire continued its use and the symbol was adopted later in Germany during the halcyon days of conquest and imperial power. “So far as is known, the double-headed eagle was first used in Freemasonry in 1758 by a Masonic body in Paris—the Emperors of the East and West.

LATIN PHRASES The following commonly used Latin phiases should be familiar to Scottish Rite N4asons: “Deus Meumque Jus”—God and my Right (Day-oose May-um-queh Yoose) This motto of the Thirty-third Degree which is en - graved in the ceremonial ring, is a Latin translation of the French ‘Dieu et mon Droit’ which means—God and my Right. The legend of its origin is of interest. Richard [, King of England from 1189 to 1199, was known as Richard Coeur de Lion—the Lion-Hearted. He spent less than ten months of his ten year reign in England because of his interest in the Crusades and his war with France. In 1198, Richard besieged the city of Gisors in Normandy. He issued to his troops as a battle-cry the words— ‘Dieu et mon Droit’ because Gisors, captured by Philip Augustus of France, really belonged to England. Richard claimed it as ‘my Right’ since he was fighting for his own. He won a great victory, in memory of which England placed the words ‘Dieu et mon Droit’ on the Royal Coat of Arms. “Spes Mea in Deo Est”—My Hope is in God. (Space May-ah in Day-o Est) “Laus Deo Custos Arcani”—God, Keeper (or Custo - dian) of thc Heavenly Secrets. (Louse Day-o Coo-stos Ar-cah-nee) “Laborare Est Orare”—To Worl~ is to Worship.
