For a period of seven years, the Jewish people had labored zealously toward its completion and finally, the Temple stood forth in resplendent beauty, awaiting only its dedication. The first procession is intended to represent that procession of Craftsmen, which vended its way over the Judean hills, bearing in stately grandeur the Keystone which was to complete the Temple. So important was this event, that even the King did design to level himself with the Craft and honor the procession with his presence. Months later, on old Mount Moriah, second procession might have been seen entering the outer courts of the Temple and passing slowly within; it was the procession of priests, bearing the sacred furniture of the Temple, and according to law, necessary to fit the sanctuary as an abiding place for God, Himself. Here might have been seen the seven branch candl estick, the table with the sacred shew bread, the holy vessels used in the ceremonies of the Temple, and the altar with its fragrant incense, all carried in so lemn procession by the priests of the Most High God. Finally, there came a third procession, la rger and more magnificent than all which preceded it, the like of which had never been seen in all Israel before; King and pauper, prince and priest joined the mighty throng which accompanied the Ark of the Covenant, the Glory of all Israel, to w hat promised to be its permanent resting places with the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. What followed is best told in the scenes which we will now enact. Remember, however, these scenes are but an allegory, teaching that we are all Craftsmen, symbolically laboring on a spiritual Temple which shall contain the Divine Ark of God Himself. This, my brethren, is t he teach of Royal Arch Masonry, the knowledge of which may serve as the capst one of your spiritual Temple now in process of erection; and may that Temple be such as will rebound to the glory of God and the Kingdom Eternal.

Now then, O Lord God of Israel, let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David. But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built! Have respect therefore, to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee; t hat thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldst put thy name there. “Hearken, therefore, unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place; hear thou from thy dwelling-place even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.” “Now, therefore, arise, O Lord God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength; let thy priests, O Lord God, be cl othed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness. “O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed; remember the mercies of David thy servant.” Fire descends from the altar and all prostrate themselves upon the floor saying: “For he is good, for his mercy endureth forever.” Three times.

"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Most Excelle nt Mast er 14 4/14/2003 LEC The ceremonies of this degree are int ended to represent those of the completion and dedication of King Solomon’s Temple. You have now arrived at a period in Freemasonry when the labor is over. The keystone has been placed in the principal arch, the Temple finished, and t he Ark, which has been so long without a resting-place, has been at length safely seated. It was the design of David to build an house, wherein the Lord God of Israel might be worshipped. And for this purpose he collected together a vast amount of treasures, consisting of gold, silver, prec ious stones, jewels, and white fine-twined linen. But inasmuch as David was a man of blood, he was forbidden by the prophet Nathan to build the house; that great work having been reserved for his son, the wise king. Accordingly, s oon after Solomon ascended the throne of Israel, the foundations of the Temple were laid on Mount Moriah. It was begun in the year 2992, and finished in the year 3000, a little more that seven years being occupied in its erection. In the year 3001, six months after its completion, in the month of Tizri – the seventh month of the Jewish sacred year – the Temple was dedicated with solemn ceremonies to the service of the one Living and True God. And in order that these ceremonies mi ght be performed with the greatest possible solemnity, King Solomon postponed the dedication until one of the principal Jewish feasts, The Feast of Tabernacles – a day he well knew would bring every zealous Jew up to Jerusalem. Accordingly, at that time they might have been seen coming from all parts of Judea, from t he coast of Phoenicia to the plains of the Jordan; and there were assembled at Jerusalem a vast concourse of Jews. The people entered within the Sanctuary and saw that all the holy vessels were placed in proper order. A procession was then formed to repair to the City of David to bring up the Ark of the Covenant. First came the High Priest, clad in his sacerdotal robes; next followed the cohens, or lesser priests, and the procession was filled up with a vast multitude of peopl e. With shouting and praise, they brought up the Ark of the Covenant and plac ed it within the Sanctum Sanctorum. King Solomon then ascended a brazen scaffold, five cubits high, and offered up that sublime invocation, a portion of which has been rehearsed in your hearing. And when Solomon had made an end of pray ing, the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and t he sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lor d filled the Lord’s house. And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshiped, and praise d the Lord, saying, “For He is good; for His mercy endurth forever.” 2 Chron. 7:1-3. And when the people arose from their supp liant position, and beheld the Temple shining with intense brightness, they were struck with bewildering amazement, and raised their hands in astonishm ent and admiration at its wondrous magnificence, as well as to protect their eyes from the effect of its exceeding brilliancy."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Most Excelle nt Mast er 15 4/14/2003 Nothing ever equaled the splendor of the consecration of the Temple. Israel had sent forth her thousands, and the assembl ed people beheld, in awful adoration, the vast sacrifice of Solomon accept ed. The flame descended upon the altar and consumed the offering; the shadow and gl ory of the Eternal proclaimed his presence between the cherubim, and the voice of his thunders told to the faithful of the Craft that the perfectne ss of their labors was approved. “Bright was the hour; When Israel’s Pr inces, in their pride and power, Knelt in the Temple’s court; the living flame; The accepted sacrifice to all proclaim. Brightly the splendor of t he Godhead shone; In awful glory from His living throne. Then bowed was every brow – no human sight; Could brave the splendor of that flood of light That veiled His presence, and His awfu l form, ;Whose path the whirlwind is, whose breath the storm.” Our Masonic Temple is now completed and dedicated. You have wrought more than seven years with zeal and fidelity, and have been received and acknowledged a Most Excellent Master.

The wages he is to receive are the rewards of a well spent life, and the knowledge of divine truth, which the Grand Master of the Universe will bestow upon all who have faithfully performed their task. You have seen the foundations of the temple laid deep and strong. As a Master workman, you have watched with unceasing care the wondrous beauties of the temple increase under the skillful hands of the widow’s Son; and now you have at length seen the object of our hopes comple ted, and the last arch bound together by the rejected, though priceless, keystone. We have now dedicated the Temple to the service of the Supreme Being; and by this we are reminded that we should also dedicate our spiritual building, that temple which we have been erecting within ourselves, tot he service of the same Supreme Being. And although we know of a certainty that all earthly things are transient, and that in process of time, even at best, the decay of ages will crumble our magnificent temple into dust, yet we are persuaded that, if we have erected the temple of our inner life by Square, Plumb-line and Rule, its foundation shall never fall, and its fabric shall never crum ble nor decay.
