Face RWM RWM My brother, (exhibits keystone) this is an imitation of the keystone upon which this degree is founded. Its color is white, and all udes to a certain passage of Scripture: “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth, saving him that receiveth it.” The new name which I now present you as a Mark Master is composed of certain words of which the le tters, H T W S S T K S, on this stone, are the initials. “Hiram Tyre Widows S on Sent King Solomon”. Repeat them with me, “Hiram Tyre Widows Son Sent King Solo mon”. Within this circle of letters each craftsman is taught to place his privat e mark, to which his obligation alludes. This was once the private mark of our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, and now is the general mark of the craft. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Mark Master 19 4/14/2003 Tools I now present to you the working tools of a Mark Master. They are the chisel and mallet. The chisel morally demonstrates the advantages of discipline and education. The mind, like the diamond in its original state, is rude and unpolished, but as the effect of the chisel on the exte rnal coat soon presents to view the latent beauties of the diamond, so education discove rs the latent virtues of the mind, and draws them forth to range the large fi eld of matter and space, to display the summit of human knowledge, our duty to God and to Man. The mallet morally teaches us to correct irregularities and to reduce man to a proper level, so that by quiet deportment, he may in the school of di scipline learn to be content. What the mallet is to the workman, enlightened reason is to the passions; it curbs ambition; it depresses envy; it moderates anger and it encourages good dispositions; when arises among good Masons that comely or der, “Which nothing earthly gives or can destroy, The soul’s calm sunshine, and the heartfelt joy.” RWM Brother SD, you will seat t he brother with the class. SD seats the candidate with the class. The lecture of this degree will be presented by Companion (names lecturer). Lec. My brother, a brief explanation of the cere monies of this Degree will prove equally interesting and instructive. At the building of King Solomon’s Temple there were employed 80,000 craftsmen, one of whom you have this morning repres ented, whose custom it was, at the close of the sixth day of each week, to repair to the Temple with work for inspection. The inspectors, who were selected from among the most skillful craftsmen, were called Overseers, and stationed at the South, West and East gates, to receive all work brought up for the building of the Temple. To provide against faulty work, wrought by unskilled Craftsmen, being received, King Solomon had ordained that every Cra ftsman should select for himself a mark, a copy of which should be placed upon each piece of work by him wrought, so that it might be known and disti nguished when promiscuously presented for inspection. The wages of a workman were a penny a day, paid by the Senior Warden, who, under orders from King Solomon, required every Craftsman entitled to wages to thrust his right hand through a latticed wi ndow, into his private apartment, bearing in the palm of his hand a copy of his Mark, and at the same time giving this Token ( given ). The Senior Warden, seeing the Mark and Token, knew that wages were due him and paid him accordingly; without the Mark or Token, he would be detected as an impostor, and would suffer the penalty, that of having his right hand struck off. The ceremonies of this degree were founded on the keystone, wrought by our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff and used in t he principal arch of King Solomon’s Temple. Our traditions inform us that on a certain sixth day a young Craftsman, repairing to the Temple with work for in spection, found the curiously wrought keystone in the quarries, and, observing its peculiar form and beauty, substituted it for his own work. He then presented it at the South gate for inspection. The Junior Overseer hesitated to receive it; but because of its peculiar form and "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Mark Master 20 4/14/2003 beauty permitted it to pass to the Senior Overseer, who, for similar reasons, passed it to the Master Overseer. The Master Overseer being unacquainted wit h the principles of the arch, and observing that it was neither oblong nor s quare, the only work he was ordered to receive, and that it had none of the regular marks of the Craft upon it, called a council of Overseers, and they knowing of no use to which it could be converted in the building of the Temple, heav ed it over among the rubbish. The young craftsman then attempted to receive wages, but for want of this Token ( given ), was detected as an impostor; and had it not been for the timely interposition of a brother, would have suffered the penalty (gives sign). When the Temple was nearing completion, the Senior Warden reported to King Solomon that the Craft was unable to proc eed with the work because of the want of a keystone belonging to the principal arch of the Tmeple. King Solomon replied that that piece of work was assigned to our Grand Master, Hiram Abiff, who, from his well-known punctuality, had no doubt pr omptly executed it. Search was ordered, the keystone found, and in due time placed in the proper position in the arch. This degree was founded by Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, and was intended not only as a reward for Industry, Fidelity and Skill, but also to render it impossible for any Brother Mark Master to suffer for necessities of life, when the pric e of his Mark would obtain them. RWM The class will rise and receive the charge, as presented by (names companion) . Chrg My Brothers, I congratulate you on havi ng been thought worthy of being advanced to this honorable degree of Freemasonry. Permi t me to impress it on your mind that your diligence should ever be equal wit h your duties, which become more and more extensive as you advance in Freemasonry. In the honorable character of a Mark Master it is more particularly your duty to let your conduct in the lodge and among the bret hren be such as may stand the test of the Grand Overseer’s Square, t hat you may not, like the unfinished and imperfect work of the negligent and unfaith ful of former times, be rejected and thrown aside, as unfit for that spirit ual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. While such is your conduct, should misfortune assail you, should friends forsake you, should envy traduce your good name, and malice persecute you, yet may you have confidence that among Mark Masters you will find friends, who will administer relief to your distresses and comfort to your afflictions, ever bearing in mind, as a consolation under all the frow ns of fortune, and as an encouragement to hope for better prospects, that the stone which the builders rejected – possessing merits to them unknown – became the chief stone of the Temple.

And he went out about the third hour, and saw other s standing idle in the market place, and said unto them: go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I will give you. And they went their way. A gain he went out about the sixth and ninth hours, and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and saith unto them: Why stand you here all the day idle? They say unto him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them: Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his stewar d: Call the laborers and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny; and when they had received it, they murmured against the good man of the hous e, saying: These last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and the hear of the day. But he answe red one of them and said: Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst thou not agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is and go thy way; I will give unto this last even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is it in thine eyes evil because I am good? So the last shall be first and first last; for many be called but few chosen.” What say you now?
