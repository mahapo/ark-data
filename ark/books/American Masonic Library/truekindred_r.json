Your tongue must remain silent and your lips sealed. Violation of your vow merits expulsion.

For forsworn meant absolute dis - grace, degradation and oftentimes death. Forsworn means to swear upon the Holy Bible to do certain things and then fail to do them; and this is just as grievous a wrong today as it was hundreds of years ago. These be the charges that these men and women of ancient times ~~swore upon a book’’ to keep, and which we, as their successors are sworn to keep today: Ye shall be true to each other and to God. Ye shall practice no treason. Ye shall call each other sister or brother and no evil or unkind name. Ye shall pay truly for all your food and raiment. Ye shall not take any work or profit from each other, nor supplant each other in any way nor let one another suffer in their worldly goods through your actions. 20 I I Ye shall not slander others behind their backs to make them lose their good names, or their worldly goods. Above all, ye shall keep counsel of all things spoken in your Temple, nor disclose any secret. Ye shall attend your Conclave, if you re - ceive warning of its assembly. If ye find yourselves guilty of any wrong, strive to amend, lest failing, you disgrace your kindred. These charges should be as sacredly kept by us today as they were of old, and I charge you that ye forget not that it is a great peril and danger to your soul to forswear yourself upon the Book. Deacons conduct candidates around Temple to Vice Commander. S. D. — Vice Commander, we seek your permission to proceed through the Temple. V. C. — Travelers and friends, because of your Masonic kinship, you have my permis - sion to proceed. I gladly direct you to greater achievements. As you advance in self-denial, putting away hasty words, anger and wrong thoughts, filling your life with good acts and fraternal love, you will be better prepared to enter that great Temple not made with hands. Naamah was Tubal Cain’s sister and the in - ventor of weaving. She had three brothers and these four were the founders of all crafts. From the beginning she was associated with 21"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"them in all their arts, crafts and inventions. Miriam, sister of Moses, constructed his ark so skillfully that she saved his life, and with his mother made the ark plumb, level, square, arched and waterproof. Learn from these noble, self-reliant daughters of ancient times your responsibility and work in making the world better because you live, and earnestly strive to become worthy builders of the Temple of Justice, Truth and Right. We are in possession of certain secrets which are sacred to us, and must be kept sacred by all who are permitted to receive them. So we require an extremely solemn vow from you. This will not interfere with your duties to your family, your church, or your social posi - tion. Yet our vow, once taken, must be sacredly kept. If after learning this you de - sire to proceed, you will be conducted to the Altar of Love where the obligation will be administered to you. If not, you will be con - ducted to the outer court when you will be permitted to depart in peace. Are you willing to unite with us in the building of this spiritual Temple, and do you wish to obtain the mystic recognition of the T. K.? If so, answer, “I do.” Senior Deacon, you will conduct the candi - dates to the Altar, where the obligation will be given.

S. D. — Worthy Past Commander, we would learn the narrative of this degree and its teachings. W. P. C. — Sisters (and Brothers), the journey you have traveled through life is long compared with the journey you take in our Temple. You will here meet those who are loyal to Friendship and Kin; those who scorn the unworthy scandal-mongers, who’ look for the best there is in others and speak not of their faults and follies. Know ye that the narrative of Ruth and Boaz, the founda - tion and keystone of this degree, teaches us to cherish in our hearts the virtues of Fidel - ity, Faithfulness, Hospitality, True Love for God arid one another. Ruth, after burying her husband, accompanied her mother-in-law into • Bethlehem. Being destitute, she went to glean in the barley fields of Boaz. At noon, when the sun was high, she became tired and hungry and sat down under a palm tree to rest. There, alone in all her modesty, Boaz saw her, and so attracted was he that he reached her parched corn and she did eat. 1-le afterwards married her, and King Solo - mon, the builder of the Temple, was a direct descendent of Ruth and Boaz. In building this temple he caused two large pillars to be erected in the porch, naming them Jachin, meaning “beauty,” which represented Ruth, 24 it and Boaz, meaning “strength.” Solomon rep - resented Wisdom. So, my dear Kindred, we surround you with the representation of Wis - dom, Strength and Beauty. Treasure them in your life while you like Ruth, gather wis - dom from your kin. Walk in love with God, whose choicest blessings shall be yours. You will now proceed to the East, where our Worthy Commander will exhibit our most valued treasures. Deacons conduct candidates past the High Priest, then east of Altar and march directly abreast to Worthy Commander’s station. S. D. — Worthy Commander, we seek the treasures of the T.

You will also understand that the reason for your be - ing D.O.A.S.J.A.O., before being permitted to enter our court, was to teach you the lesson of equality. In this Order we know no castes for neither gold, elegant attire, or pre - cious jewels form the stepping stones to mem - bership. Individual worth is the only wealth recognized, while true merit, coupled with Chastity, Purity of Heart, Fraternal Love, and Open-handed Charity to all mankind are the jewels to be worn in actual service by all who enter the inner court of this Temple. Kindred, let these cardinal virtues govern your lives; Fortitude that you may resist temptation, Prudence that you may regulate your conduct by the dictates of reason, Tem - perance to govern your passion, and Justice, by which you must direct your duties toward all mankind.

We trust it may be your privilege to drink deeply at the “Fount oC Inspiration,” and so excel in all that you worthily undertake. You may succeed in placing your name high above all others upon the scroll of Fame. Decorations of Merit and Jewels of Worth and Beauty may be yours, but even so, you would not be the proud possessor of the equal of that which you have just received. Although possessing no real monetary value, yet, pause my sister (my brother), if tempted to think lightly of this our simple token. It has values that cannot be repre - sented by gems or gold.

But the greatest of all, it will afford you the oppor - tunity of giving expression to your charitable impulses. You have taken the first step. There re - main the Heroine of Jericho and the Good Samaritan degrees, in which you will find further opportunity for progress in the True Kindred philosophy of life. You must always remember that we owe our existence and inspiration to the Masonic Fraternity, which from time immemorial has stood for Justice and Equality among men, and has taught, by precept and example, the principles of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. Its record is unblemished and the lustre of its achievements undimmed. Mem - bership in the True Kindred imposes on you the solemn obligation to so conduct yourself that Free Masonry may never suffer or be disgraced by any act of yours.

May your labors be fruitful and bring you satisfaction and the joy that passeth all understanding, so that when the time shall come, when the faltering steps you descend the Western Slope, towards the setting sun, with the shadows lengthening behind you, travelling onward to that land from whose bourne no traveler returns, you may pause near the end of the day, and look back over the pathway you have trod, and see the road lined with good deeds, with kindly thoughts and with happy memories.

Chap.—Let us pray. Almighty and everlasting God, our only help in time of trouble, be near to us in this hour of deep affliction. A dear one has gone from our midst, and we are indeed sorrow - ful. As Thou art ever pitiful and tender, we beseech Thee to pour the richness of Thy love and mercy into the hearts of those who are so sadly bereaved. Sustain them by Thy grace, and direct their sorrowing hearts from the gloom of death to the glory of the resurrection.

She presses it to her lips, then drops it upon the casket, passing around it followed by the officers. Sing “Nearer, My God to Thee” while passing around casket or grave. W. C.—Our Sister hears not our words of love and praise, and sees not our tribute of flowers, but may we not hope that out of the lessons of this hour will come an a drooni - tion to the living, a lesson that will come as a still, small voice, bidding us to be more tender and kind while yet there is time, that no measure of regret may darken our future years, for “Closed eyes cannot see the white roses, Cold hands cannot hold them, you know; Breath that is stilled cannot gather The Odors that sweet from them blow. What to dulled eyes are kind sayings, What to hushed heart is deep cry, Life is the time to help others, So be kind lest your chance passeth by.” Let us unite in paying the last honors to our beloved Sister.
