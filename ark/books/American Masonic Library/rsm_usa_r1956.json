In the preparation of this Ritual, the ~ Committee has endeavored to present one that can be utilized by a small Council in the usual hall and at the same time will admit of elab - orate settings with stage accessories. Nothing has been added to it. In its present form it is a mere elabora - tion of the theme of the old Ritual, in a concise, direct and dramatic manner. The historical inaccuracies have been corrected; the great lesson of the degree pushe.d to the forefront, and made to conform to that dignity and solemnity that should character - ize Masonic degrees. The Ritual is a compilation and ar - rangement of the old General Grand Council Ritual, the New York work and the rituals of several Councils in Ohio. GEORGE McGOWN, of New York, WILLIAM F.

Their symbolism will now be explained to you. (At this time the emblems will be formed around the altar by a sufficient number of Comps. who march in from the ante-room or are on the stage. Or the emblems may be successively pro - jected upon a screen by a lantern. The explanation is given by the I. M. or by some Camp. selected for that purpose.) Note:—If the emblems are to be formed on the stage or around the Altar, the Camps. who form them should be thoroughly drilled, so that each emblem may be accurately formed. A march should be played and all movements exe - cuted in time and step. The Capt. of G. or some Camp. selected for the purpose should be in charge. He should know in detail every movement to be made. They should march in from the ante - room or wings of the stage to form the Square; the movements afterwards are left to be planned and executed by the officer in charge. The Camps. should be clothed in white robes with flowing sleeves to body (com - monly known as angel sleeves). As the square is formed or appears on the screen: (The R. A. banners may be used in this square.) 1. M. :—The square is one of the most significant of the emblems of Masonry. Its four equal sides sub - tended by four perfect angles, sym - 10 bolize the four Cardinal Virtues, which are imprinted upon the memory and engraven upon the very soul of every true Mason: Temperance, For - titude, Prudence and Justice. In Masonry every Perfect Ashlar must be true and square, in order that the structure may possess strength and beauty, each living stone must be squared by the square of truth and virtue, in order that the Masonic edi - fice may continue to hold aloft its hoary head, crowned with majesty and clothed with stately lines, to be in the future, as in the past, the wonder and admiration of all ages. (As the triangle is formed or appears on the screen:) 1. M. :—The triangle or delta is emblematic of Deity, its three equal sides representing His omnipotence, His omniscience and His omnipres - ence; His universal power, univer - sal knowledge and universal pres - en Ce. It also symbolizes the triumph of Freemasonry over Ignorance, Intoler - ance and Bigotry, the three greatest enemies of human liberty and prog - ress. It also teaches the three great virtues: Faith, Hope and Charity, re - minding us of our triple duties as 11"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Masons, those we owe to God, to our neighbors and to ourselves, teaching Faith in God, all-wise, all-powerful, and all-merciful; Hope in the ulti - mate triumph of truth over every form of error, and Charity, or Love, for all mankind, especially our breth - ren. (As the circle is formed or appears on the screen:) The circle is an emblem of Friend - ship, the Sacred Law in the center, like the blazing star in the Mosaic pavement, is an emblem of Divine Providence, the radii from which verge in direct lines to every part of the circle, and end in that. It is also emblematic of the circle of our moral duties, reminding us of the point with - in a circle in E. A. degree. It is fur - ther an emblem of Eternity, having neither beginning nor end. This em - blem encourages the hope of a full immortality by faith in the Divine promise. (Curtain.) LECTURE. 1. M. :—My Companions, a brief re - hearsal of the ceremony of this degree reveals to you a sad historical event in the life of the Jewish Nation and bears with it a lesson of profound moral significance. Zedekiah, who reigned at that time in Jerusalem, was the Uncle of Jo - hojachin, the youthful King, placed at eighteen years of age upon the throne of Judah, who having rebelled against his master, King Nebuchadnezzar, was dethroned and imprisoned after a brief reign of three months. The King of Babylon bestowed the vacant throne upon Zedekiah in the expecta - tion of securing a faithful liegeman. In this he was mistaken. Zedekiah “did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.” Forgetting his obliga - tions to Nebuchadnezzar, he formed an alliance with Egypt, the hereditary enemy of Assyria and Chaldea, and attempted to overthrow the authority of Babylon. Swift vengeance over - took the traitor. A Babylonian army invaded and ravaged the country, be - sieged Jerusalem and after inflicting a crushing defeat on the Egyptian Al - lies, captured the city. Zedekiah, ac - companied by his family, fled in the darkness of the night toward the Jor - dan; but was overtaken and made prisoner near Jericho. Zedekiah and his sons were taken to Riblah, where 12 13"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Neb. then abode; and he, with cus - tomary Asiatic cruelty, ordered the sons to be slain before their father’s face; then deprived the wretched par - ent of his eyesight, bound him with fetters of brass, and conveyed him to Babylon, where he probably died. Thus were verified what had seemed to be the contradictory prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. The former predicting of Zedekiah—”Thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the King of Babylon and he shall speak to thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon,” and the latter announcing, “I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans, yet see it he shall not, though he shall die there.” The Temple and City of Jerusalem were destroyed, the inhabitants car - ried away into captivity and the King - dom of David and Solomon ceased to have a place on the earth. This ceremony depicts the conse - quences of infidelity to trust, the cer - tain punishment that follows perfidy in friendship, not only to the perjurer but also to those of his household. It also brings forcibly to attention the mercy of the Divine Father as illus - trated by His forgiveness of the Jew - ish people and their restoration to their native land. The degree teaches that Fidelity to all vows is an absolute necessity if ~ would be worthy of the title of Super Excellent Master; it also inculcates true devotion in spirit and in truth to the Great I AM in contradistinction to idolatry, teaches traditionally life’s vicissitudes; encourages generous hos - pitality and friendship; enlightens the mind and amends the heart, that we may become wiser and purer, brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. It also teaches the faithful fulfill - ment of our several vows, and the fearless discharge of our respective duties; and admonishes us that the violation of our solemn obligations as in the ease of Zedekiah, the last King of Judah, will not only cause us to forfeit the respect and friendship of our Companions, but will also most surely destroy our own peace of mind.

Al. :—.—My Companions, the degree of Super Excellent Master has no connection, either in history or sym - bolism, with the Royal or Select Master. It refers to circumstances which occurred during the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuzaradan. Com - mander of the Army of the King of Babylon. The ceremonies are intend - ed to represent the final destruction of the Temple and the carrying away of the Captive Jews to Babylon, as exemplified in the first portion of the Royal Arch Degree. The opening scene represents the captives in Babylon, under the direc - tion of Ezekiel, the Prophet. Here in their darkest hour, under a foreign despot, there came to them from the Sacred Law a peaceful light from Heaven, promising a final restoration to the scenes of their former glory The second scene of this degree is laid in one of the apartments of the Temple, and the events narrated there - in, occurred in~ the last hour of the last day of the third and last siege of Jerusalem. Zedekiah, the last anfi 16 twentieth king of Judah, was upon the throne. His infidelity to his vows, his contempt for the Prophet of God, and his cowardly acquiescence to his false Councilors are faithfully de - picted. The third scene represents Neb - uchadnezzar, King of Babylon, with his court at Riblah. Jerusalem had been taken, Zedekiah was a fugitive and captive, his arraignment and ter - rible punishment follows. Zion is des - olate. These scenes are not intended to merely represent a historical event, but to bring to your minds and hearts the great lesson of fidelity—fidelity to your vows as Masons, and as citizens, and a firm faith and reliance in God. 17 A"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"hi 2F~e~’LDN 5cr.~ir 1 /~ 373 3 5 IELr 3 5 3 3 xxxxxx 7 S ~ 3 3 7 3 A 1- = Noi 5 ToM!~ A[ 1 AR;2L2EkIEL,3COrl’. pA~1,or15 [xir~’c DowN; ~.

The first scene represents a typical incident in the captive life of the Jews in Babylon, where they were taken after the fall of Jerusalem in the eleventh year of the reign of Zed., the last of the Judean kings. The capture of Jerusalem and the captivity of the Jews and their return therefrom was depicted in the R. A. degree. Here you see them in their captivity reaping the results of their infidelity and that of their perjured king. They have been toiling in the nearby fields and are gathered here at the close of the day. The Prophet Ezekial is seek - ing to console them by reading from their Sacred Writings. The Prophet Jeremiah is in Jerusalem. 19 A 2 A"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"SCENE 1. ‘rhe Captives in Babylon. The Sanctuary in a Grove.

You have just had an intimation of the servitude and sadness of a people in captivity. How they came to be in such condition is the subject matter of the two scenes which now follow. The next scene represents the court of Zed. at Jer. This wicked and faith - less king had been besieged within the walls of his city for eighteen months and the scene shows the last day of that siege, closing with the capture of the city. The scene begins just after a herald has brought reports from the waIls of the city. 26 (If the haIl does not have a stage, a curtain should be stretched across the center to avoid the necessity of remov - ing candidates fi~om hail at change of scene, as well as to facilitate change of settings.

I, my - self, have just learned that King Neb - uchadnezzar has been completely over - whelmed by your armies and your noble allies, the Egyptians. (Sound of disturbance at the door.) (Keepers go quickly to entrance.) (Jeremiah forces his way to inside the door.) Jeremiah :—Hinder me not. I will see the King, I will see the King. (First Keeper advances and addresses the King.) First Keeper :—Jeremiah has es - caped from prison. King Zed. :—Jeremiah! Why comes he hither? (To Jeremiah, who is restrained by Keepers.) King Zed. :—Jeremiah! Thou didst promise to abide in the court of the prison. Why hast thou come without my consent? Jeremiah :—I have a message which may not wait. King Zed. :—Keepers, go hence until you are called. (Pause while Keepers go to their sta - tions.) King Zed. :—And now, Jeremiah, thy message. (Jeremiah advances to center of hall.) Jeremiah :—The fate of Israel, her city and Temple, hang trembling in the balance. This day—nay, this hour 2 —must decide if the Kingdom found - ed by Jehovah, and the Temple erected by Solomon his servant, shall together and forever cease to be. Ere the cock crows shall it be decided if thou be indeed the last King of Judah. For this reason, therefore, I have come to thee, 0 King. I have come to conjure thee~ to leave off thy impieties and transgressions and to take care of that which~is right, and neither to give ear to those wicked advisers, nor to~yield credit to their false prophesie~ who have deluded thee. They told thee that the King of Babylon would no more make war against thee, and that the King of Egypt would make war against him and conquer him. They told thee after Nebuchadnezzar had laid siege to our city, that the King of Egypt came with a mighty army to drive the Babylonians away and that the army of Nebuchadnezzar had given up the siege, having been driven away by the Egyptians. And then they steeped thy soul in for - getfulness. They filled thine ears with unholy music. They catered to thy pleasures with wine and to 28"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"thy lust with harlots and concu - bines. They told thee not that~ the Egyptian Army had been routed and destroyed, but I tell thee that the Babylonian Army has again renewed the siege, that even now they make a passing breach in the walls, and that they may be upon us at any moment. Lo, I prophesy. (Keepers drop to knees in attitude of fear.) Jeremiah :—Bef ore another dawn shall lighten the Eastern sky the sol - diers of Nebuchadnezzar shall throng the courts of the Temple and every - where shall be unhallowed ravage and devastation. Keepers :—Lord! have mercy. Jeremiah :—I see thee, 0 King, a fugitive upon the Plains of Jericho. Keepers :—Lord! have mercy. Jeremiah :—I see thee caught like a skulking dog, thy sons slain before thine eyes. Keepers :—Lord! have mercy. Jeremiah :—I see thee bound in chains of brass and carried a Captive to Babylon. Keepers :—Lord! have mercy. Jeremiah :—I -see the Holy Place defiled by the soldiers of Nebuchad - nezzar. and the Shekinah departed from Israel forever. Kcepers :—Lord! have mercy. Jeremiah :—AIl this must be unless thou repent. (Keepers arise and approach Cede - Iiah.) (King confers with courtiers.) Pashur :—Heed him not, 0 King. His troubles have made him mad. Zephaniah :—The old man’s mind wanders. Pashur :—Long confinement in pris - on has unsettled his reason. ZepMniah :—It was ever his wont to prate of naught but woe and la - mentation. King Zed. :—Jeremiah, I long have loved thee and have often listened to thy words. I have heard and believed agreeing to that which thou hast said as true, yet now do I recall that ever thy sayings were heavy with tales of woe. Naught else hast thou ever dinned into mine ears. Thy soul was surely begot ‘neath gloomy shades. For thee the sun never shines, lovers do not love, birds do not sing, nor flowers bloom. Canst thou not, 0 Priest, prophesy pleasant things? ‘Jeremiah :—Wouldst thou have me merry while death hangs over our 30 31"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"people? Wouldst thou have me speak lightly when destruction broods over our city and Temple? Yet, fain would I prophesy pleasant things— yea, verily, I bring thee good tidings if thou wilt but repent.

The hosts of Nebuchadnezzar are thundering at our gates, yet if thou wilt repent, even now, the God of our Fathers will deliver thee out of his hands. Listen to the promise: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: (Soft music.) “Then will I build thee up and not pull thee down; then will I plant thee and not pluck thee up for I repent me of the evil I have done thee.

Surely thou dost re - member the many great wars in which my armies have been victorious under thy command—all the great Kings from the River of Egypt to the River Euphrates have been made to pay homage and tribute—therefore, I ask thee, Nebuzaradan, why hast thou for eighteen long months permitted this weak vassal, Zedekiah, to withstand our mighty army, our chariots and horsemen? Hast thou lost thy cun - ning? Hast thou become less a war - rior, that this weakest of rulers hath put thee to naught? Remember, Neb - uzaradan, ne~arly two years have passed since I commanded thee to bring this wicked King Zedekiah be - fore me. Nebuzaradan. :—Mighty Sovereign! hear me, I pray thee. Since thou didst make me Captain of thy Guard I have led thy armies in many fierce conflicts to victory, but never to de - feat. I swear to thee that my arm is as strong, my nerve as steady, and my brain as clear now as ever before, but this wicked King is full of subtlety, and as thou knowest, did enter into alliance with the King of Egypt and secure the aid of Pharaoh’s army, which for a time diverted my attack upon Jerusalem, but we did over - whelm them, and returned again to the siege upon Jerusalem, and I now come to thee with good tidings of vic - tory. Our assault has been success - ful. Jerusalem is taken, and their last stronghold is in our hands, but King Zedekiah and all his men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the walls, which is by the King’s gar - den, leading out upon the Plains of Jericho, and thus escaped— King Neb. :—Zedekiah escaped! He whose capture I most desired! Speak I Nebuzaradan—sayest thou Zedekiah escaped? Nebuzaradan :—Yea, Oh, King. But our army pursued after him and over - took him on the Plains of Jericho, made him prisoner, and he is now without and awaits your commands. King Neb. :—(To his councilors) At last, then, the conquest of that city is again accomplished. Twice before, when our armies invested Jerusalem, did their King submit tamely, opening his gates without resistance; but this Zedekiah, whom I myself placed upon the throne and who swore to me an oath that he would keep his kingdom for me and make no league of friend - ship with the Egyptians, hath despised his oath and defied our armies. 42 43"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Surely will I now make desolation in the place of that proud city, but, until I have poured out my punish - ment upon the head of its wicked ruler, my vengeance ~vill not be com - plete.

Thy faithfulness shall not go unrewarded. Captain of our Guard thou hast been. I now make thee Grand Captain of all our Armies. Be seated near the throne. (Nebuzaradari is seated next the King.) Nebuchadnezzar :—Aha! thou base and perjured Zedekiah, thou wicked covenant breaker, at last I have thee in my power! Did not I set thee on thy throne, in the room of Johoiachin, after that I had taken him captive? King Zed. :—Yea, sir. King Neb. ~:—And didst thou not then solemnly agree and covenant with me. swearing by the name of thy God, that thou wouldst be faithful unto me, and hold thy kingdom loyal unto me? Answer me. King Zed. :—Yea, sir, but thou didst demand of me the impossible. I am a man in whose veins runs blood as royal as thine own. Take off these chains, array me in my own pomp and glory, and I will show thee that I can play the Monarch as well as thou. King Neb. :—(Interrupting) Si - lence! Wouldst thou flout me to my face? Thou hast well said, that thou canst play the King, but thou canst not be a King, thou canst not even be loyal to a friend—and I was that friend. Thou canst not be faithful to a trust—and I trusted thee; and how hast thou repaid me? The chief glory in the crown of manhood is fidelity, the brightest jewel in the diadem of a Monarch is fidelity, and behold, there is not one of thy promises that thou hast not broken, for thou didst enter into alliance with the King of Egypt, and didst make rebellion against me, so that thou hast twice compelled me to come up against thee with all my armies, my chariots and my horse - men— ~King Zed. :—(Interrupting) Hear me, pray, I did no more than thou w~uld.~t have done, hadst thou been 44 45"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"placed in my situation. Couldst thou blame me if I would free my people from thy yoke? Pashur and Zeph - aniah did counsel me to throw off thy rule.

Thou wert false to me. And surely it is thine own God that has delivered thee into my hands, because thou didst mock his messengers and practice cruelty towards his prophets, placing them in prison, and in the stocks, and even in the pit of mire, and hast more and more hardened thy heart and stiff - ened thy neck until there is no remedy except thy complete de - struction. Therefore, this is the judgment that I pronounce upon thee and upon thy people. Nebuzaradan, Captain of our armies, shall utterly destroy thy city of Jerusalem. The Temple shall be burned with fire, the remaining remnant of its vessels and ornaments shall be broken and carried to .Babylon, thy palaces and the houses of thy great men shall be destroyed and the walls of the city thrown down even to the ground, and all the people that have escaped the famine and the pesti - lence and the sword, shall be taken captive to Babylon. And as for thee, it is my order that thy sons be slain before thine eyes, that none of thy perjured race may remain after thee, and that thou mayest see and know that thou art indeed the last King of Judah, and then that thou mayest know that the words of the prophets of thy God were true when the one said that thou shouldst be taken to Babylon, while the other said that thou shouldst not see Babylon, thine eyes shall be put out and thou be taken in chains of brass unto Babylon.
