They impose on you, my Brethren, the necessity of labor, and of study; for there is nothing that is worth doing in this world, which can be done easily, and without labor or preparation.

Before us and behind us, from the point called Now, extends Time, to which we can as little conceive of end or limit. Co-extensive with the former, GOD is Infinite; co-extensive with the latter, He is Eternal. His attributes, among which are Goodness and Mercy, Beneficence and Loving- kindness, as well as Po~ver and Wisdom, His Patience and Tenderness, as well as His Justice, are infinite in number, and each infinite in perfection. The Soul of man, cgeated by God or an Emanation from the Deity, is not liable to decay or dissolution. and therefore is immortal. NATURE is the great Universe, created or uttered by God; and all the Suns, Stars, Worlds and Creatures, animate and inanimate, are the great Book of the Revelation and Manifestation of the Hidden Deity; of which Universe, every orb, substance, soul, thing, thought and movement is a Hieroglyphic written by God, the representative character and expression of a thought of God. REASON is the Infinite Supreme Intelligence of the Deity, and also that limited portion of the same with which He has endowed us; the faculty by which we read His writing on the pages of the Book of Nature; the Interpreter, often mis - taken and always imperfect, of the written thoughts of God.

It is a bold claim that one prefers, when he characterizes himself as ~‘perfect.” To assume and wear these titles is to endue our duty with greater severity and observation, and subject ourselves to higher degrees of obligation. Remember that whatsoever is excellent, is not to be obtained without labor or sorrow, and whatsoever is easy, is trifling and worth nothing. The work of Masonry, like tbe work of God, cannot be done negligently and idly. In this work, one must put forth all his strength. Vain meetings and laborious trifles, and whatsoever spends much time to no real, profitable or charitable purpose, are in no wise the work of Masonry. Leave them to those who can appre - ciate nothing higher, to those who love the trifling employments that merely serve to pass the time away.

Think not of the service of Masonry as a work of the least necessity, or of small employment; but let it be done as the Masters intended it—with earnestness and persevering passion, with zeal and desire, refusing no labor, nor grudging to bestow upon it much time; using the best guides, and endeavoring to attain success and victory, by all the ways of prudence, of effort and of honor.

When a Knight falls sick, you will visit him, and inquire into and provide for his wants; and when one dies, it is your duty to make proper provision for his burial. And, on this, and all other occasions that offer, remember, and remind also the Knights and Brethren, that Charity, with its twin-daughters, alms and forgiveness, is especially effectual for the procuring God’s mercies in the day and manner of our death.

In these matters, modesty is the truest wisdom. No one should dogma - tize, as to matters beyond our finite comprehension. If to think is, for the Deity, to utter the Thought and so to create, and if He did not exist an eternity or an instant without thinking, the universe may truly be said to as little have had a beginning, as the Deity Himself. If a Brother believes that the sins of men are atoned for by the blood of a Redeemer who died upon the cross, no one can of right or philosophically say that to cause one to suffer for the sins of another is unjust; and that the sins of one cannot be atoned for, and their consequences prevented, by the sacrifice of another. For it is not only the noblest act of human virtue for one volintarily to suffer for the sins and errors of another, but often in his lifetime it occurs to every great and good man; and the human race are so bound together by a thousand interlacing ties that this sacrifice of one for another is of absolute necessity and constant occurrence; and could only be deemed unjust, if the consequence were. not to atone for the ~in or errors of another, for which the victim suffers. And every day we see the consequence~ of the errors of men and nations prevented by the voluntary or in - voluntary sacrifice of innocent individuals.

Teach them also that the noblest and highest degree of Charity or Loving-kindness is, by the sacrifice of self, to atone for the sins, errors or follies of others. So the great saviors of republics have always done; and one life has often been the salvation of a State. There is nothing so noble in human nature, as that it can suffer and endure for others; and that the spirit can be firm and constant, when the flesh, shrinking from agony, prays that the bitter cup may pass away from it. This is indeed the Divine, united in man with the Human, and crying, ‘~Not my will, 0 Father! but Thine, be done!” It has not been deemed prudent or advisable to give the whole explanation of the symbols. at the time of reception. Our Ancient Masters, the Indian, Persian and Egyptian ilierophants, displayed the symbols to the Initiate, and let them speak for themselves.

Neither did the Hieropliants deem it just that others should without labor and the long and sleepless vigils of study and reflection, be put in possession of the discoveries made and the knowledge accumulated by them with immense research and painful thought and long-continued toil. Even the Oracles uttered enigmas only; and the Prophets prophesicd dark things; and Jesus spoke even to his disciples in parables, hard to be understood. In all this, it must be confessed, there was much reason; and we, to a considerable extent, pursue the same course. We draw aside but a corner of the veil of the great goddess, Is~is. But, on the other hand, this system of necessity became the fruitful mother of common and vulgar errors. Left to guess for them - selves, at the solutions of the enigmas of the mysteries, enveloped in the symbols, men, sometimes from pre - conceptions, somnetinies from the opaqueness of their intellect, sometimes from ignorance, and sometimes from mere inconsiderateness and haste, guessed awrong, and gave false explanations~ which, often repeated, canine to be regarded as true, and displaced the true ones; so"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"54 OFFICR5 OF INSTAlLATION OF A that many of these are now irretrievably lost. Of this there are many instances in symbolic Masonry, upon which we are not now particularly concerned to remark. “ABSCONDE FACIEM TUAM ET ORA,” Veil thy face arid pray! sayeth the Kabalistic dogma. The Hebrews, to possess their thoughts more collectively in prayer, covered their head with a veil called Thalith. The custom came from Egypt with them, and ~the veil symbolized that of Isis. It means that ho])’ things are to be hidden from the Profane; and that one should communicate to God alone the secret thoughts of his heart. Neither permit the Brethren vainly to imagine, that a dogma is necessarily true, because one is ready to die for it, or even because many have d8ne so. Error has its martyrs, as well as Truth; and those have also often suffered for their faith, at the stake amid on the scaffold, who would, if they had had the power. them - selves have been the perseculors of those who, with better fortune were able to persecute them.

For unity of religion can never be established, until the Spirit of Charity reigns supreme. Then will be the universal communion of men, and the Lost Word will have been found. Charity must first triumph in the bosom of the Church, and Bulls and Allocutions cease to denounce Freemasonry because it teaches God’s lessons of Loving-kindness and Toleration. It is, an eloquent and pious Bishop of the English Church has said “An act and otfice of Faith, to belicve nothing concerning God, but what is honorable and excellent, as knowing that belief to be no honoring of God, which entertains of Him any dishonorable thoughts. Faith is the parent of Charity; and what - soever Faith entertains, must be apt to produce love to God; but he that believes God to be cruel or unmerciful, or a rejoicer in the unavoidable damnation of the greater parm of mankind, or that He speaks one thing and privately means another, thinks evil thoughts concerning God, and such, as for which we should hate a man; and therefore are great enemies of Faith, being apt to destroy Charity. Our Faith concerning God must be, as Himself hath revealed and described His own excellencies; and in our discourses, we must"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"56 INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS OF A removc from Him all imperfection, and attribute to Hhn all excellency.” ‘0 0e~ dydmy ~a’r~, [Ho Theos Agap~ esti], “The Deity is Love,” is the dogma of the Knight Rose Croix, pronounced for him by John the Apostle, with the even more striking declaration, “and he who abides in love, abides in the Deity, and the Deity in Him.” Teach this, with whatsoever flows legitimately from it. By it only is the world to be emamicipated and regenerated. When men shall conceive of a just God, they will have equitable rulers. Beliefs make opinion, and opinion consecrates powers. The Divine right of Louis XI. was in entire harmony with the God of Dominic and Pius V. God is to each man, what he imagines Him to be. The worshipers of Bnal and Moloch were not accursed, because these were real Gods; but because they worshiped false ideals, making Gods unto themnselves in their own image. No people can be truly emancipated and enlightencd, unless it worships a beneficent and loving God, the FATHER in Heaven of the Human race. The EAGLE is the characteristic sign of’ Saint John the Apostle. It is the symbol of Liberty, Intelligence and Sovereignty. By the dominion of Loving-kindness only, can come true progress. It only can constitute those who are truly freed from all bondage, of the body and soul, by their toils and virtues, priests, kings and possessors of the world.
