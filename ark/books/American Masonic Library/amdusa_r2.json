The term s \"Ard\" and \"Knight\" ar e used synonym ously, though \"Ard\" actually means \"High\". Introduction The history of this degree, as with others is shrouded with uncertainty. According to F.G.Irwin, the degree was in existence in Ireland prior to 1757 when it came to the US by means of im migrants and was passed down in the O'Donnell fam ily until it was conferre d on Irwin in 1858. Irwin took the degree to England and established it as a working body instituting Brian Boru Faslairt No. 1 in Bristol in 1872. Erm enion Faslairt No. 2 of London, Malachi No. 3 in Dublin, and Eam hui m No. 4 in New Zeland followed. It becam e dorm ant around the turn of th e century and was revived in 1918 by members of the SRIA with a new ritu al. It becam e an invitational body for SRIA V o degree and above m embers of the So cietas Rosicruciana in Anglia. There are two Faslairts active, one in London and one in Australia. M.V. J.Ray Shute and M.V. William M.Brown obtained perm ission of the English authorities to establish this Degree in the US with the AMD. It was adopted in 1933 with every AMD m ember eligib le for m embership upon paym ent of the fee. The degree becam e an honor in 1937 when Grand Steward's Council \"B\" was established and local Counc ils were allowed to nom inate one \"Grand Steward\" each year who would receive the degree as a consequence of m embership. In 1940, the Grand C ouncil allowed the local Councils to directly designate a lim ited num ber of m embers for this honorary degree each year. This practice still continues t oday. This ritual is the 19th century English ritual as copied from John Yark er's m anuscript. It has been included in the general ritual since 1960. Prior to that tim e it was available only to Red Branch of Eri member s as \"Ritual #3\". The em blem of the degree as used by the AMD in the US is a wh ite Salem Cross with a red branch superim posed sinister. In England the emblem used by the Grand Mur- Ollam ham is an Irish cross in red s uperim posed on a green circle. Both of these emblems are used by the AMD in Canada.

Ard Cruim thear - Sir Knight, I welcom e you as a m ember of that glorious band of heroes, of which the one mighty Monarch Brian Boru was an honored Chief. This honored Chieftain, in accordance with the teachings of our Red Branch Order, devoted the whol e of his private fortune to works of public utility. He rebuilt the churches, schools and colleges (destroyed by the Danes), built forts for the protection of his people, constructed roads, bridges and m assive causeways, to facilitate the passage of his troops and the conveyance of m erchandise from point to point; he also erected Hospitals and Royal houses for the entertainm ent of travellers, and of the sick and needy. He was in fact Grand Patron and Grand Master of the Freemasons, and appointed Inspectors to superi ntend the Craft throughout the land. Feeling the pressure of the Danes to be intolerable, he collected a considerable arm y and, assisted by Ma lachi, who had already distinguished him self in battle against the Danes, m et his country' s enem y at Clontarf, on Friday 23 April, 1014, and altho' num eri cally inferior to the enem y, who were, alas, assisted by Irish auxiliaries , gained a com plete victory. Hence, Good Friday has been ever since observe d as a festival of our Order. The hero, through his age, 86, was unable to take part in the fight, but after reviewing his troops, riding along the ra nks with a sword in his right hand and a crucifix in his left, pointing to Heaven with this sacred emblem, he assured them of victory if they were onl y true to them selves, and then retired to his tent, to pray to the God of Ireland for victory against their heathen oppressors.

At the tim e of the invasion of Crom well, two of the Orders appear to have been used by the rival religionists; The Golden Sword by th e Catholics and the Red Branch by the Protestants. There is little doubt that th ese Orders were in full use down to the tim e of the battle of Boyne, after wh ich the Red Branch appears to have been adopted by the Freem asons and the Orangem en, who at that tim e practically form ed one body.

He gave this authority over the four Provinces of Ireland as follows: The Militia was known as CRAET-NAATH CREEVERVE MUNSTER, to four sons of EAMHIUN FUIN. The Militia was known as CLANNA DEAGNA, CONNAUGHT, to UN and EADIM. The Militia was known as CAMBRANA JOIUAS, LEINSTER, to CUUNITHUIM of the DAMONIANS. The Militia was known as CLANNA DIRSCHICE, ULSTER, to ERNEHIUM son of IR. From this it appears that the Orde r was founded in 1697 B.C. We read further that it was in the \"year of the world 3872\" or 1327 B.C. that NURMANHOU caused chains of gold to be worn on the necks of Kings or Chieftains in Ireland. Thes e dates, it will be seen differ slightly from those of our Certificates, which date the founda tion of the Order 1712 B.C. and that of the Collor of Gold as 1342 B.C., but these few years of divergence are of little im portance. The Keepers of the public Records were the Bards, and we find that OLLAM FODLAH (OLLAO FOLA) that is, Chief or Great Poet existed as a lawgiver 1277 B.C. The date of his death when com pared with 38"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Lawgivers of other nations is as fo llows; Moses died 1451 B.C., Lycurgus 559 B.C., Confucius 479 B.C. Ireland is full of circular structures called Forts, Raths, Maughts, etc., inside of m ost of which the wooden structures or houses stood when the Militia assem bled, the circular earth affording shelter from weather, and protection from en emies. MAYBURGH, near Penrith, is of this nature, and near it is the hollo wed out circle now called King Arthur' s Round Table, which is suppos ed to have been used for chariot races, and our own Assem blies ought to be arranged by a strip of green carpet, horseshoe pattern. In these tim es the King' s Court was held at or near the town of Arm agh, and a very celebrated palace existed there between the years 300 B.C. and 332 A.D. when it was destroye d by fire, and the Court was then transferred to TARA. The Pal ace of FAMHUIN, latinized ERNHINA, contained houses and quarters which were appropriated to each of the four Provinces, and the defenses of th e Kingdom were regulated from these headquarters. In a great m any Irish r ecords, The FIVE RULES of the Militia or Knights, are either given in full, or otherwise referred to as also the manner of admission to their ranks as a warrior. Such receptions were always m ade during the annual sum mer trainings of the Militia. Every sum mer, for three m onths, the m embers of the four branches of the Militia were called out from their hom es for wa rlike training and com pelled to live in the Forest, then abundant in Ireland, and support them selves by the chase, receiving as an acknowledgem ent of th eir services, certain specified contributions of grain, payable to them by their own district. These bodies used to assem ble in their own Provin ces, make themselves Booths of the branches of trees or wickerwork, and cook in the open air, and in very m any places in Ireland, their \"hearths\" are r eadily discernable, even now, owing to the great accumulation of ashes and st ones on the spot where they were usually built. It was during these trainings that candidates sought adm ission to their ranks. The Aspirant was to be placed in a level field encompassed with green sedge up to his knees; he was to have a target by him, and a hazel stick in his hand, the length of a man's arm. The nine experienced Cham pions were drawn out and appointed to stand a distance of nine ridges of land from him , and to throw all thei r javelins at him at once. If he could defend him self with the stick and target , so as to com e off unhurt, he was adm itted, if not, he was rejected. In som e of our m odern Rituals, a representation of this is used as the trial for a Man-at-Arm s. Also, he was required to run well, and in flight to defend him self from the enem y without halting; he had his hair plaited a nd was obliged to run through a wood pursued by his com rades, being given only the start of the br eadth of a tree, and if he was surrounded or caught, he was rejected. When he ran his hair 39"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 40 should not get untied that he should be so swift and light of foot, that in running he should not break a rotten stic k; he should jump over a stick the height of his forehead, stoop under a s tick as low as his knee, and take a thorn out of his foot without slacking hi s pace. Some rituals allude to these trials, making them the signs of an Es quire. (\"Touch the forehead with open hand, grasp the knee and lift right foot as if to take a thorn from it\"). After the introduction of Christianity, it would seem that the old Irish Gods were turned into Christian Saints, and it is re markable that about eight Saints were connected with all the \"Holy Wells\" and Holy Places in Ireland. The Irish also designate the four Cardinal points as the same was as the Indians and Hebrews. These names express their positions with regard to a person standing with his face to the East. Thus OI R (ur,ir) is East, this is \"in front\"; IAR (eer) is West, \"behind or back\"; THAITH (tova) is North, \"the left hand\", and DEAS (dase) is South, \"t he right hand\". About the year 250 A.D. FIN-MAC-CUMHALL (the FINGAL of OSSIAN) was the head of the Leinster branch of the National Militia, known as FENII or FENIANS and resided at the Palace of ALMHIM in Lein ster. But the Ulster branch of this, even then, ancient Order of Irish Chivalry, was termed CENAIDHE NA CRAIOBHE SUAAH, or Knight of the Red Branch from their chief seat in EMANIA, near the Palace of th e Ulster Kings called TEAGHNA CRAILOHE RUHR, or Academy of the Red Branch, adjoining which was a Hospital called BROUTHEAGER or House of the Sorrowful Soldier. The reason of the more popular survival of the Ulster Branch of the National Organization is owing to a speci al cause. After Ireland had been disorganized, year after year, by the incursions of the Danes, some of the Knights of Ulster, with their followe rs, made an incursion into Connaught, and settled in Mayo, and Galway, where they retained their Organization formutual protection against those tribes or families from whom they had taken the district and driven them off to other parts of the Province. Our Order continues, as much as compa tible with modern civilization, to correspond with the organization of the Ancient Knights. "}]
