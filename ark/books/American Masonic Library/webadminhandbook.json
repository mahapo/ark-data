Although this is more of a \"Computer System\" than a tru e website (see the topic: \"How t he Grand Lodge Website Works\") we will refer to it as a website. This website was created in about 1999 not only as a system of which would enable the Grand Lodge of Nebraska to get information out to the public as well as its subordinate lodges, but would enable each Lodge as well as other appendant bodies in the sta te of Nebraska to be able to have their own website hosted on the \"Grand Lodge's\" website. Too which, if you are reading this, you must be the designated \"webmaster\" for your Lodge or organization. Congratulations! This help system is designed to aid you in your journey of making your organization's website, a hub of activity... a place where your members, community, and they world will go tout o get the information about your organization. Some of This information that you will be \"posting\" on your w ebsite might include such things as \"Calendar of Event\", \"Mission Statements\", \"History Of Your Organization\", and much more! With this is mind, this \"Help System\" is designed to aid and guide you in getting your information out! Included in this guide i s not only everything you will need to use out \"System\" but also templates, rules, and tips in making successful web pages. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Website Administrators Handbook (Draft) Page 6 of 66 HOW THE GRAND LODGE WEBSITE WORKS The Grand Lodge website is more of a \"Computer System\" or \"System\" than a website. When most p eople t hink of websites they think of Html and web pages. This site is a little different in the fact that it is written as active server pages (asp) using a database. This database is where the \"web pages\" are stored. The web pages stored in the databa se like most normal web pages are comprised of \"Html\", but modified to exclude some of the tags that are normally associated with \"htm\" pages. The pages are displayed by the asp scripts retrieving them from the database and then presenting them on the scr een. What this means, is that because of how the pages are stored and displayed, some of the functionality that is associated with most web pages is lost. Some of this functionality includes: frontpage extensions, some scripting languages such as vbscrip t and javascript. The above functionality, that is lost, is what is used to create many of the bells, whistles, and gadgets that are seen on many other sites. However, the true purpose of a website is not so much is techno - gadgetry or artistry, but moreo ver to communicate information. With this purpose in mind, this \"Computer System\" performs this function admirably. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Website Administrators Handbook (Draft) Page 7 of 66 GRAND LODGE HOSTED AND NON - HOSTED WEBSITE RULES 1. Lodge websites are Lodge activities and, therefore, under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge. 2. A Lodge website must be presented and maintained in good taste and conform to the Constitution, Resolutions and Edicts of the Grand Lodge. Page designs are up to the individual Lodge; however, the initial design must be approved by the Internet Committee as follows. The home page (the first page seen by someone coming to the website ) must contain the caveat \"Pending Approval of the Grand Lodge Internet Committee\" when it is first posted. The committee will be notified by an email message to Gra nd Lodge stating that a new page(s) has been posted and giving its Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The Grand Lodge webmaster will notify all other members of the committee and the site will be reviewed. When approved by a majority of the committee, the L odge webmaster will be notified to remove the caveat. 3. The Lodge website must not link to any website where there may be any conflict with the princip les of Freemasonry. If another site requests permission to link to a Lodge's website; and, in the opinio n of the Lodge webmaster, the principles of Freemasonry would be violated, permission must be denied for the link. If a link is discovered from a site that did not ask permission, and that site is found to be in violation of the principles of Freemasonry, a request to remove the link must be sent. There must be a link to the Grand Lodge's website on any Lodge's. 4. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc. of Grand Lodge Officers, Committee Members, and Custodians will not be published on Lodge websites.

Any Lodge website which solicits funds must use existing approval methods; i.e., approval of the Grand Master. (This does not apply to fund raising events such as yard sales, suppers, etc.) 7. When a website hosted by the Grand Lodge needs a MAJOR change in content, the changes may be made and posted by adding the caveat to the home page as described in item 2 above. The Grand Lodge will be notified of the changes by email and the committee will rev iew the site again. After approval, the Lodge webmaster will be notified to remove the caveat. Major changes do not include upcoming events, changes to Lodge Officers, news items, etc. 8. The Seal of Grand Lodge of Nebraska will not be used on a website w ithout written permission from the Grand Master. Graphics will not be taken from other Masonic sites without permission. (Permission is not necessary to use any graphics from the Grand Lodge's website.) 9. These rules are subject to change by the Internet Committee, with the approval of the Grand Lodge Officers.

"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Website Administrators Handbook (Draft) Page 24 of 66 SETTING UP / MODIFYIN G THE HOME PAGE The first thing that you may want to do is to set up your organization’s home page. This can be done easily enough by clicking on the link “Edit Home Page” off the “Website Administra tor’s Menu”. By doing so this will bring up the online “page editor” (figure 4) which will allow you add, change, or delete information off the home page of the website. Figure 4 . “Online Editor” More information about how to use the “online editor ” to change your home page is contained in the section entitle d “Overview of The Online Web Page Editor Toolbar Functions ” later in this text. Although changing your home page is easy to do, be careful when doing so. Remember not only this is the first p age that is seen by a visitor to your site, but also is the first page that is loaded upon entry to your site. This is important as, different visitors have different connect speeds to the internet. Large graphic files to a user with a DSL or cable modem will generally load very quickly, however in rural areas; many users are still using telephone lines and modems, which are significantly slower. With this said the general rule of thumb is to keep the home page clean neat and fast loading. As with all p ages you may create there are other rules that will also apply. These rules are covered in the section “Web page creation rules”. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" Website Administrators Handbook (Draft) Page 25 of 66 CREATING CUSTOM PAGES On your website you are allowed to create many “Custom Pages”. Custom pages can either appear as li nks on your websites menu, or can be linked to within other pages even including your home page. Custom pages are generally used for static information. Some examples of custom pages could include a message from the Worshi pful Master (“From the East”), a page containing your Lodge’s history, or even an “About Us” page which could give general information about your Lodge, and its activities in your community. To add, delete, or modify custom pages, click on the “Custom Pages” on the “Website Administrato r’s Menu”, this will take you into a page showing all the custom pages your website has currently created (figure 5). Figure 5 . “Custom Pages” From there you will see the a list of the custom pages that have been created as well as when they were c reated as well as the last time they were edited, and whether they are either a public or private page. Also in this listing are links to “edit” or “ delete” individual pages as well as a link at the bottom to create a new custom page. PUBLIC VERSUS PRIV ATE CUSTOM PAGES Custom pages can be of two types “Public” or “Private”. Public pages are pages which will show up with their title names on the menu side bar locate d on the left hand side of your website. Private pages are pages that can be “linked” to from other pages, but the page title will not display in the menu bar. With this in mind, if you are creating “Public” pages it is good to be very careful of the name that you give to the page. The page name should be something easily identifiable, su ch as; “From the East” , as this is what will show up on the menu side bar. . Also be aware that the page title has a limitation as to the number of characters that it can be made up of. At this time, a page title is limited to 20 characters.

It allows users to enter and maintain information without having to purchase special equipment and or software. All that is needed to maintain your site is a w eb browser, an internet connection, and a password. This is a very flexible feature that allows the web administrator to virtually maintain the website from anywhere in the word. The online web editor is very similar to a word processor and has both a WY SIWG (what you see is what you get) interface, as well as the ability to switch to HTML (hypertext markup language) mode in which advanced design features can be created. Further, it has drag drop and object resize capabilities. This is extremely useful when resizing images, for the image only has to be clicked upon in the editor, and using the resize boxes that appear, the image’s size can be enlarged or diminished.

Through its use, information can be quic kly disseminated to Lodge members via email. Tips on creating a newsletter are to use the options associated with “news” & “stories”. Below are examples of using the newsletter feature to create a monthly newsletter, as well as to broadcast a message out to Lodge members with email. A typical MONTHLY newsletter might include: • Calendar of up coming events (news article / latest news) • “From the East” a message from the Worshipful Master. (news / latest news) • An article or feature about an officer or bro ther in the Lodge (news / latest news) • Masonic Education (story / top story or latest story) • Other information pertaining to a newsletter (see the Grand Lodge’s Public Information Committees criteria for winning the newsletter award. This is available t hrough the Grand Lodge office). Broadcasting a message out to the Lodge email capable members would include the following steps: 1. Create a news article containing the message that is to be broadcasted via email. 2. Save the news article as “Latest News”. 3. Create a newsletter containing only the created news article and send it out to the membership. 4. Either edit the news article and change its status to “archived” or delete the article altogether. Changing the status to archive keeps the news article, wit hout displaying it out to the public, deleting the article removes it from the site altogether.

These books cover everything from advertising your site, making it ADA compliant, to even matching the correct colors and styles. However, i nclude d bellows are just a few commonsense simple tips about making a good web site: 1. Condense textual con tent to fit the time and attention constraints of today's busy Web users. 2. Spell check and proof - read your documents. 3. Use small (byte - wise) graphics so graphics load more quickly in graphics - capable browsers. (It is not advisable to use GIFs for everythin g. It's of the first importance to make the right choice between JPEG and a palette - based format. Avoid blindly choosing GIF and then trying to rescue yourself from the resulting problems.) 4. Be aware of the pitfalls of character sets / fonts . Not all users have all fonts. Arial, Verdana , Courier, San Serif, and MS San Serif, are pretty much standard. 5. Be careful when using color (background, foreground, text, etc.) 6. Bells and whistles, although neat and cool may not always be appropriate. 7. CONTENT – CONT ENT - CONTENT! "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" Website Administrators Handbook (Draft) Page 56 of 66 DOMAIN NAMES & DOMAI N NAME REDIRECTION . What is an internet domain name ? B asically and simply it is a short name that points to your website. Computers on the internet connect to one another using an IP address. An IP address is lik e a telephone number that points to a web server. An IP address takes the form of “nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn”, where “n” stands for a number. An example of an IP address would appear as follows:”182.128.254.1”. But because it is easier to remember names, rather t han numbers, out on the internet are specific servers called domain name servers. These servers contain domain name databases that act very similar to a phone book, and as such translate the IP addresses (phone numbers) into names. Some examples of domai n names are as follows: “Nebraska - Grand - Lodge.org.”, “amazon.com”, “state.ne.us”, “state.ne.gov”. Moreover, these domain name servers, also have the capability of not only pointing a domain name to a specific IP address, but also can through a little magi c point a domain name to a specific webpage. For example, the AnyLodge No. 777 lodge website has their home page on the Grand Lodge’s website at “ http://www.nebraska - grand - lodge.org/defaultLodge.asp?pageID=1&lodgeID=193 ”. This is not easy to remember, no r is it easy to print on business cards, therefore the webmaster purchases a domain name of “AnyLodge777.org” and has it redirected to the page http://www.nebraska - gr and - lodge.org/defaultLodge.asp?pageID=1&lodgeID=193 . Once done, a user only hast to type in www.AnyLodge777.org to go directly to the “AnyLodge” web site. Purchasing an internet domain name and redirections se rvices, previously was once expensive. At one time, to purchase a domain name for five years could run as much as $200 or more. Further, the domain name may have already been taken and not have been available. Today, domain names and redirection service s can be purchased for as little as $15 for the first year and a renewal cost of $5 per year. Domain names can be purchased online. A quick search on any of the major internet search engines will reveal many vendors and competitive prices. One such vend or is “redirection.net” based out of Canada. They offer this service, as of this writing, for $15 to purchase a domain name and one year’s worth of redirection service, with an annual renewal rate of $5. More information on this can be found at www.redirection.net . It should be also noted that there are many vendors who offer the same service at even a lower price, however this company has been found to be easy to use and reliable, and as always it is up to the individual webmaster / organization to make their own decision, when deciding upon and purchasing a domain name.
