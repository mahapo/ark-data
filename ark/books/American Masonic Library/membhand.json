Plan, Program, Prepare Set lodge goals and agenda for the year Hold a planning and goal-setting m eeting with your officers. Give strong consider atio n to inviting the lad ies to participa te. Docum ent specific activities and g oals each month that your lodge wants to accom plish. Make a lodg e calend ar for review. Make sure your lodge is represente d at the Grand Lodge Annual Communication!! 2. Attract New Members Identif y me n in your community who would meet the qua lifica tions of membe rship . Having trouble comin g up w ith names? Try the follow ing tools: Target prospects and follow up with visits Telephone Book Look for relatives of present or past m embers Look throug h the local n ewspaper an d l ook for p eople who recen tly celebrated or will be c elebr ating 25 th year wedding anniversaries or even wedding announcem ents. Both of these events help identify potential “baby boom ers” who may f ind them selves with m ore time on their hands. These m en who now are looking for exactly what Masonry has to officer – a chance to “give back” to their communities, a sen se o f belonging, frat ern al relations, etc. Don’t overlook m en who have e xpressed an interest in the pa st, even those who m ay have t aken their 1 st or 2 nd D egree(s). Maybe that simply wasn ’t the right tim e or perhaps there were other circum stanc es that in terfered with their m embership. ( Ta lk to these men about their potential interest in the fraternity, using your personal experiences and describe what Masonry has meant to you. ) Send a letter to your non-Masonic friends. Hold a “Friendship Night” (or Brother Bring a Friend Night). Take advantage of an Awards Program. Utiliz e the r esources of the Grand Lodge of Nebraska. 3. Spice up Lodge Meetings Streamline the necessary bu siness p ortion of the meeting. Suggestion: Print, don’t read, m inutes a nd financial reports. Summ arize communications (don’t read them verbatim ). Refer to: W ardens Hand books and Tips for Running a Successful Meeting . "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Add informational and educational pr ograms to every s tated communica tion. Experiment with meals/r efreshmen ts before and/or after meetings. Experim ent with tim ing of program s, i.e., have your program before dinner, followed by lodge m eeting or have the pr ogram during the m eeting, or afterwards – over coffee/refreshm ents. Don’t alway s rely on the same bro ther to provide the program – pa ss the responsibility around. Caution: There is a fin e line b etween encou raging brethren to give a program and making sure it is interesting. Make sure the program s re main interesting. ( Remember, a large part of Mason ry revolves around self-im provement. However, don’t fo rce a brother to speak if he doesn’t want to. ) The program doesn’t have to be Masoni c. Have a m ember com e and talk abou t his profession. You’d be su rprised how m any brothers would find that very interesting. Consider using non- members to provide a program. Don’t f orget to inc lude wives/f amilie s in som e of the progra ms/activities . Contact the Grand Lodge office to request a speaker. Announce the Agenda of your meeting in advance through postcards, local newspapers, newsletter or telephone. Create curiosity and intere st in the m eeting announcem ent. For instance, instead of writing “Brothe r Joe will discuss Ma sonic Opinio ns of Revolution ary Leaders,” write this: “D id you ever wonder why Thom as Jefferson was never made a Mason? W as he anti-Mason ic?” Take advantage of the Mentoring Program to educate current, even long-ter m membe rs. Have your officers and members visit an other lodge for their regular or special meeting. 4. Famil y Involvement Involve the ladies in yo ur planning process. Find ways to involve the e ntire fa mily in your events (especially Masonic widows). 5. Community Involvement/Visibilit y Take part in parades, community fes tiva ls, ce leb rations, e tc. A lodge Open House could be held in conjunction with a community celebration or event. Organize a servic e func tion such as lining up snow removal for the elderly or disabled. Think what good could com e from a photo in the local newspaper of a group of Masons with snow blowers and shovels re moving snow for an el derly or disabled member/resident. 10 Steps to Lodg e Rene wal Page 2 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" The possibilities are unlimi ted. Use your imag ination. Adopt or join with an other Community Service Organization for a worthwhile project. Examples: Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary, C of C. Adopt a highway for clean-up. 6. Initiate a major fundraiser, either fo r y our lodge or a w orthy cause in the community An example might be to help raise money for a new fire truck or ambulance for the department. Don’t feel you have to reinvent the wheel here – keep your eyes open to som ething that m ight already be goi ng on in the comm unity and jum p on the bandwagon. ( This would be good if your lodge is a bitshort on active members right now. ) Other fundraisers Hold a m ont hly soup/sandwich feed – open to the public. Have a pancake breakfast for the public. Have a repo sitory f or re deem able cans. Public ize this. 7. Membership retent ion/Utilizatio n Get new me mbers invo lved right aw ay. Get them involved with m eetings and other lodge happenings m entioned above. Contact Brethren who haven’t atten ded lodge lately. Let them know they have been m issed. Assign them a duty for the next m eeting and offer to pick them up. Organize “pick- up service” for those brethren who may be uncom fortable driving. This is especi ally useful for night driving or poor weather conditions. Organize a “Telephone Tree” to make contact w ith all broth ers easier. Have several brothers be responsible fo r contacting the en tire me mb ership. This can be very useful for special m eetings and funerals, etc. Survey your membership, particula rly the youn ger member s, for what type of activities they would be inter este d in. Think outside the box – it doesn’t have to be Masonic related. How about a “cards night,” watching sports on a big screen television, etc. Let them give you their ideas and lis ten to them . Make them feel a part of the process and the Lodge. Hold a “Rusty Nail” Degree or a “Re-obligation Night.” Publicize the event. Inv ite m embers of nearby lodges. In case of a m ajor Rededication Cerem ony, the Grand Lodge m ay like to participate. This can help rem ind your m embers why they becam e Masons and why they m aintain their membership. 10 Steps to Lodg e Rene wal Page 3 "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 8. Publicize y our Lodge (Internally and Externall y) Appoint a member to be in charge of Public Relations Internal Pu blicity Obtain e-m ail addresses of Lodge m embers. This will p rovide one more way to c omm unicate with the m embership. Initiate or improve your Lodge newsletter. If your Lodge already has a newsletter, consider spicing it up. Do som ething radically different in the next issue to generate interest. This could be som ething as easy as rearranging the c onten ts to add ing a new featu re to putting in s omething co ntrover sial or using a s ensational h eadlin e. Ha ve f un with it. One of the negative opinions the uninitiated have of Masonry is that we are a bunch of Stuffed Shirts. A ppoint a m ember to be in charge of Public Relation s. External Publicity Subm it pres s rele ases to local n ewspapers Local news papers a re always look ing f or thin gs to f ill s pace. It is very im portant th at the articles are well written and com plete. Don’t expe ct th e newspaper to edit and/or correct m istakes. Assistance on what to subm it and how to write an article is available from the Gra nd Lodge Public Relations Comm ittee. 9. Lodge Appearance Don’t forget one of the Lodge’s best resour ces of publicity and commu nity in volvement is the Lodg e building itself. The appearance of your lodge building says a lo t to the uninitia ted. Are you sending the rig ht message? Hold a clean-up, painting party. Ma ke a fun day/night out of it. Make sure the sign on your building is clean and in good shape. Place highway signs at each entrance to your community. Be sure the sign states the day/tim e of your regular m eetings. This could be ( but wouldn’t have to be) designed around a major addition to capital im prove ment to your lodge. 10. Last, But Certainl y Not Least – Ritual Make sure your Lodge can and does provid e top-notch ritual in your degrees and meetings. Hold a Ritu al School of Instruction Contact the Grand Custodian or the De puty Custodian in your area to arrange a tim e and place for a Sch ool of Instru ction. Identify members in your Lodge who are potential candid ates to become a Masonic Instructor. 10 Steps to Lodg e Rene wal Page 4 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 10 Steps to Lodge Renewal Page 5 Finally Brethren, please understand that you and your Lodge are not in this alone.

What you as the leader need to know As a leader, it is not your primary job to do the recruiting. However, it is your job to discover ways your lodge can locate, attract and receive men into the Fraternity. REMEMBER, RECRUITING IS NO LONGER AGAINST THE RULES! Who are our targets? Men ages 35-55 (Remember, if there is an opportunity to br ing in men outside of this age range, DO IT!) From a survey of 1000 men in the age group 35-55, almost all of them expected to be asked to join an organization. Why this age range? This age range is generally more interested than men in their twentie s, or older than 55. What next? 1. Identify on paper the most successful stra tegies you have used to get men to join. 2. Develop two new approaches, knowing the importance of an “invitation.” 3. Write a dialogue of what you can say to a prospect that encourages his joining and which he considers an invitation. 4. Make a list of how the most successf ul recruiters in your lodge recruit. B. Things we know about me n who might join Masonry Not all men are interested in joining Mas onry or any other group. Fa vorable interest is only shown for about 25% of the men survey ed. Of this 25%, only 2% show definite interest, and the other 23% may be interested. Results from the Survey: Who is more likely to join Masonry? 1. Men between the ages of 35 and 55. 2. Men with college degrees. 3. Single men were more interested than married men. 4. Professional men were more intere sted than blue collar workers. What do we know about men who might join Masonry? 1. 75% said any organization that excluded their wife as a member was unappealing. 2. 70% said they objected to a dress code. 3. 72% said they found memorizing materials not very appealing."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2-3 4. 88% found any organization that wa s racially exclusive unappealing. 5. 93% said they wanted to be invited to join. 6. 92% said the quality of leadership of an organization was important in their decision to join. 7. 92% said the charitable effort s were important to joining. 8. 88% said an image as philanthropic or charitable was important. Of these, 89% included outdoor and sports image. 9. 88% said modest fees for joining were important. What role do you as the leader have in reference to this information? The key role of a leader is to determine wh ich factors are the strongest and to encourage the membership to use these positive features and benefits to help sell the organization. That is what your key recruiters do on a daily basis. Ask them for HELP . Things to develop and review 1. Review all of the availa ble research to determine the facts about your future members. 2. Review with new members why they join ed and what they hope to get out of the organization. 3. Contact people who have dropped out and discover why they dropped out and what needs were not met by your lodge. 4. Identify the most crucia l factors affecting your lodge. 5. Develop a list of potentia l benefits the lodge offers that match the needs and expectations of new members. 6. Identify significant negatives and determine the best way to handle any objections. Key things to stress 1. Stress the benefit of meeting new fri ends, enjoying the company of other men, and making new connections with like-minded men. 2. Stress the role a wife can enjoy as a partner with her husband in many Masonic events and programs, and how important the family is to the Fraternity. 3. Show the things your lodge has done in the community, and let potential members know about their opportunities to participate. 4. Demonstrate excellence in leadership, a nd show him how he can be a leader also. C. Where are these men who we want as members located? Potential members are all around you!! Potential members come from every walk of life. They are your friends and neighbors, and also friends of friends. They include your doctor, dentist, lawy er, accountant, service personnel, married and single men. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2-4 Key points for development 1. Potential members from professional ranks can bring important leadership skill that can be an asset to the lodge. 2. Men with whom you have a relati onship are your best prospects. 3. Location can have an effect on the interest in joining. 4. Rural lodges may have more success in appealing to potential members than urban lodges. 5. You will make more headway if you appoint a Membership Development Team. Development Team 1. Identify the names of men who might ha ve an interest in joining. They do not need to be interested at the time. 2. Develop a pool of potential members as large as possible. Make sure this is well defined. 3. Tailor a plan for each prospect. D. What role does your current membership play? Older active members may have a very small circle of friends and acquaintances outside of the lodge. This may limit them as messengers about the organization. The key to meeting and exceeding membership goals is getting the younger members to get their friends involved. Involve and activate your new younger members. Get names of prospective members from all the member s of your lodge. The most productive will generally be the names derived from your younger members. Activities and social events geared to ward the younger membership should be encouraged. These programs may not be the favored programs by your older membership. As a result, your role as lead er will be more important than ever. Organize your membership 1. Set realistic new-member goals for the lodge. 2. Establish new member teams among active members by age groups. Do team development. 3. Host several young member nights with ev ents that include a sports or athletic competitions. 4. Give a report card for the lodge to new members to track lodge progress. E. What do we mean by Membership Development? Masonry depends on people joining. Some of this is voluntary and unsolicited, and the rest is through good membership development. No lodge will survive if they do not pay attention to member needs. Develop and reta in membership by encouraging participation. With an increase in membership comes an in crease in the importance of the organization."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2-5 As a result, customer relations and membersh ip development are important steps in the development of great leadership behaviors. 1. Provide new and existing members be nefits based on their personal needs. 2. Develop programs to meet these needs. 3. Their satisfaction ensures they will re main a member and recommend the lodge to others. F. Developing the skills and attr ibutes of our current members What can we do to devel op this man called a member? 1. We need to know why he joined. 2. We must develop programs to meet th e expectations of members. If food and social events are the reason for your membership, then build more programs around these activities. If it is ritual that drives your lodge, do more in this end. Remember, lodge leadership has many alternat ives that are closely related to the needs and expectations of members. If we make our membership happier with the organization, we will keep these members and they w ill want to bring in more members. Things to try: 1. Put information about members on the computer in an easy-to-use format so that when you need information, it’s at your fingertips. 2. Ask every new member why he joined and what expectations he has from membership. 3. Ask members to do something th at is in his area of interest. 4. Involve the member with men who have similar needs and interests. 5. Communicate at least 5 times with a ne w member within the first 6 months of membership. 6. Call new members if they do not happen to attend lodge. 7. Make each new member feel comfortable when attending lodge. 8. Develop communications that are directly related to their spouse. 9. Involve the family in lodge and make sure they understand about our organization. 10. Make a big deal out of every member who joins! G. What role might incentives play? Offer incentives to lodge members Incentives for existing members who devel op membership and help maintain current membership is important. Top-line signers ar e very important to increasing membership. Properly used, incentives can encourage a man to encourage a friend or relative to ask more about Freemasonry and joining."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2-6 1. Develop a presentation that informs memb ers of the lodge about the consequences of doing nothing on membership developmen t. Most lodges will be half the size they were in 1980 by the year 2101. 2. Show what the finances of the lodge would be with half the membership. 3. Consider developing lodge incentives th at reward members who get new petitions and who provide guidance for new members. 4. Publicize the recognition for your active membership development people. Recognition in lodge is essential!! H. What have we heard about one-day Classes? One-day classes are a way to bring in ne w members who would not normally commit to the time of doing all of the degree work in lodge. Membership can be substantially improved through the utilization of one-day cl asses. These are given at various times throughout the state. Benefits 1. Reducing the amount of time it takes to become a Master Mason for men who normally would be too busy to participate. This is sometimes appealing to businessmen and other professionals. 2. Reduces the amount of work needed to be done by the candidate for the degree. Downsides 1. Masonic education is cut short. When members go through one-day classes, the lodge needs to add to their Masonic education. 2. The lodge may not be ready to receive these new members. Pursue these members and get them back and involved. If you do not do this, these names will end up with your retention committee. Lodges must be able to take advantage of the one-day degrees when needed. Develop a plan for Masons who have gone through one-d ay degrees, paying par ticular attention to their Masonic orientation and making th em feel welcome and comfortable while attending lodge. I . Who says we can’t “recruit” new members? Get used to it. If our organization is going to survive, we will recruit. Remember, this is not a secret organization. We ar e an organization with secrets. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2-7 Try these strategies: 1. Get your lodge in the news. Lodges who make positive news and are active in the community, especially in th e local schools, attract the interest of men who are looking for an organization in which they can feel proud. 2. Go where the boys are. If you decide you want younger men, sponsor a softball team, or become active with the PTA. The more people you come into contact with, the more potential members you will know. 3. Let others know what you do in Mas onry. Speak with prid e about Masonry, and how wonderful a group it is with which to be involved. 4. Remember to let your best friends kn ow about Masonry. Include your son and his friends and parents. Do not forget to as k if they have ever thought about joining Masonry. REMEMBER – SPEAK WITH PRIDE ABOUT MASONRY!! J. What can the Lodge do to create wider appeal? The community needs to know more about Masonry. They need to know what Masonry stands for and how to join. Your lodge n eeds to have a connection to the community. Instant appeal can be achieved with sponsoring programs for kids. Get your lodge involved with local schools a nd projects that benefit kids. Fathers are there with their children. Male teachers will be there. Impressive work gets positive attention. This is always a good recruiting tool. K. What to do when no one knows your name Masonic recognition today is not what it was in yours gone by. Everyone used to know about the Masons and what they did. Toda y, only about 8% of the heads of households know what Masons do and who they are. Things to do: 1. Improve signage on your building and grounds. Get your name on the welcoming sign and roads into your community. 2. Join with other volunteer groups on a major project and make sure you get credit for your participation. 3. Do something good and positive in the community on a consistent basis. 4. Meet with local reporters on a regular ba sis. Take their advice, and let them know about what your lodge is doing. 5. Develop a lodge handout that explains who you are and what you stand for. Make it available throughout your community. 6. Ask your lodge membership to let othe rs know about your lo dge’s role in the community. 7. If your lodge can afford it, buy awar eness advertising in the local paper."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2-8 8. Let people see the square and compa ss. Advertise on cars, windows and other locations. Press coverage considerations What the press considers news may be enti rely different than the lodge. Before you get coverage in the local press, you have to unde rstand their needs for readers and advertising and take your lead from what they tell you. 1. Identify a community writer or two from the local press. 2. Put together a packet of information about Masonry and your lodge in particular. 3. Arrange to meet the writers for lu nch. Discuss with th em your ideas about coverage in their paper and ask them what w ill be of interest to their readers. Take note of how they speak of advertisers a nd readers even if you are concerned only about your image. 4. If they offer additional assistance, take it. (They could also develop into a new member.) L. How can you make a new Maso n’s first experience DELIGHTFUL? Masons have tried to find better words to describe the benefits of joining Masonry. No word says it better than DELIGHTFUL . If a new Mason’s first experience is delightful, they will pass this good feeling on to others and recommend or endorse the activities of the lodge. Members become delighted with thei r decision to join when a combination of the following occur:  Time is not wasted  Fellowship is real  Events are fun   Food is good  Value is received  Cliques disappear  Joining is easy   Friends are supportive  Meetings aren’t boring  Leaders know their jobs Wives like what we’ve done Pride is a result Make sure to ask new members “How are we doing?” Report the results to the lodge.

In im plementing this process of propos al and election of a candidate for Freemasonry, it is emphasized that this alternati ve process is never to cause a member of the Masonic Fraternity to take more casually the process of carefully c onsidering any potential candidate. A standard form of petition must accompany the Recommendation under Section 2-913. The petition is simply completed and is signed after the candidate has been elected. If the candidate does not sign the petition or fails to answer ques tions in an acceptable m anner, his election under 2-913 is voided and he shall not become a Mason under Section 2-913. The Process: Form of “Recommendation of a Candidate” is si gned by three Proposers, each a member in good standing in the subordinate lodge of which the proposed candidate is a potential member, each Proposer being personally acquainted with such potential candidate. Attached to the form of Recommendation will be a standard form of petition unsigned, but completed as fully by the Proposers as knowledge by them of the potential candidate will allow. Note that the standard questions on the petition w ill have not yet been posed to the candidate or answered by the pot ential candidate. Form of Recommendation with incomplete and unsi gned standard form of petition is presented to the Lodge Secretary, who presents the Form of Recommendation and its accompanying petition to the Master at the next regular stated meeting. The Master announces the proposal of the potential candidate and orde rs the Proposers to serve as a committee to review the form of Recommendation, to consider their recommendation and to make report as a committee at the next stated communi cation. The report may be returned with a favorable or unfavorable report and the Recomm endation is signed a second time by the Proposers as provided on the Recommendation Form. The signed report is returned by the committee to the Secretary at the stated meeting next following the stated meeting at which the proposal was made. The Master will order the ballot spread on the proposed candidate. As otherwis e provided in the Grand Lodge By laws, the balloting process will follow that set out in Sections 2-1001 through 2-1006. An objection may be filed and sustained in the sa me manner as set out in the Grand Lodge Bylaws in Section 2-1101."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Master will declare the result of the ballot. In the case of a favorable ballot, the Master will direct the Proposers to meet with the potential candidate to advise him of his election, and to discuss with him the nature of the Masonic Fraternity in order that he is in formed of his obligations and the process of the three degrees of Masonry, respond to such questions as he may raise and invite his completion and signing of the standard form of petition. [In the event of a ballot that is declared not clear by the Master, the Master will declare the potential candidate not elected and will direct the Secretary to retain the Form of Recommendation and the accompanying petition in the Secretary’s l odge files.

The Recommendation process for the sa id proposed candidate may not be repeated for a period of six months within the same subordi nate lodge. However, since such candidate did not initiate the petition process, and has no knowledge of the matter, such individual may of his own initiative petition the same or another subordina te lodge for membership at anytime and properly state that he has not prev iously petitioned a lodge.] The completed and signed petition will be delivered to the Secretary of the Lodge within 60 days from the date of the election of the candidate with appropriate fees for initiation.

It is more important to know about those who will be your fu ture customers! Sometimes we call them prospects, but by any name, they are critical to our future! First, we must understand in some detail who these “prospects” are. Learn as much about them as you can before they join. By taking this course of action, you can struct ure your programs for membership development and retention to the needs of your memb ers. You may also discover that your future members will want be nefits from joining that are different from your current members. You probably won’t have to change your lodge, but you will need to accommodate these needs. Don’t let old ways of doing things get in the way! A leader who considers building his membersh ip by attracting new members to his lodge will discover they bring few negatives as new members. Renewing the lodge by rekindling the interest of inactive current members mean s “an unhappy” member may be rejoining and you should be prepar ed to handle the consequences. B. What are their attitudes toward joining? Actually, we know a great deal about thes e men who might join. Research shows the following six behaviors about men: 1. 75% said they had little or no interest in joining. 2. 90% said they had no time. 3. 90% said they would not join a secretive organization. 4. 85% said they would not join an or ganization that would not allow women as members. 5. 95% said they did not want to wear a special uniform. 6. 0% said they wanted more ritu al and memorization in their lives. We have a very difficult task to appeal to men of quality and we had better do it right ! Some real benefits men want in their liv es which may represent an opportunity for leaders who know how to use them are: 1. The vast majority (85%) of those interviewed wanted more friends. 2. Nearly 100% said they wanted to make new connections. 3. Nearly all married men interviewed wanted better time with their family. 4. 80% wanted to have some role of importance in their community. 5. 60% wanted more opportunities to lead. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"3-3 C. What are men joining and why? Try this: Establish a membership development team Research clearly indicates mo st men are not joiners, so we are competing with other organizations (such as Elks, Ea gles, Lions, etc.), so we mu st not only work hard to recruit, but we must work smart. Lou Harris surveyed 1,000 youthful men at random for the Imperial Shine and found: 1. 76% said they were not involved in clubs, civic or ganizations or societies. 2. 24% said they were involved (college graduates were twi ce as involved as high school graduates). 3. 6% said they were involved with fraternal organizations. 4. 47% of men age 35 – 55 had a problem finding the time to be involved. Of these, only 8% said they had no problem finding time. 5. 29% of men polled had trouble fi nding enough time for their jobs. D. How do men who might jo in use their free time? USA Today poll: Use of free time: 1. Reading 46%  2. Watch TV 24%  3. TV Sports 12%  4. Active Sports 9%  5. Hobbies 6%  6. Other  3% Clearly, time (meaning the effici ent use of time or time not wasted) is a promise you will have to make to men who might join. From the beginning of recruitment, we should: 1. Build time-related questions into the home visitation or investigation. 2. Make men aware the time required at the beginning is longer than time for meetings. 3. Make sure every meeting and ev ery event uses time effectively. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"3-4 Ask yourself: What is the difference between “perceived free time” and the amount of time a man will commit to something he really enjoys? E. What are new-member expectations? Men who do not belong to any organiza tions are looking for the following: 1. New friends, the opportunity to meet and make new friends and connections. 2. A role for their families, not as members, but as participants. 3. A role in the community and the feeli ng of pride that comes from this type of involvement. 4. An opportunity to lead and become l eaders in the organization they join. You may believe that pursuing these four points will make your Masonic Lodge more like a social or civic club, but if you ove rlook what our future members NEED, you will not achieve the gains in membership that your lodge needs, Guaranteed. Make your lodge a warm and welcoming place where it is possible to meet new friends and where the special kinds of fellowship Ma sons are capable of offering are not only possible but also the reality. You won’t believe what satisfac tion this will bring to all of your members. F. What role does your leadership play? So far, we hope we have made the point that there is nothing more important during your years in the leadership of your lodge than to look after your curr ent future members. Installing this as part of the culture of your lodge could be your greatest contribution. First, you need a plan with goa ls and strategies for the next several years. It could look like this: Membership Goal Strategies Goal – Year 1 Goal – Year 2 Goal – Year 3 Second, you need a team who will impl ement the actions in your plan. Third, you need benchmark targets against which you will measure results or take corrective actions. Fulfilling those three key ideas over severa l years will help eliminate disruption and confusion. It’s also clear that if you are the Worshipful Mast er or the Senior Warden, you"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"3-5 will not be in the office when your three-year plan is complete. Hence, the importance of installing team leadership is crucial. Your goals should include four to five first class events for each year. G. What can we learn from The Promise Keepers? Suggestion: Read and study the organization of “The Promise Keepers.” For the past several years, there has been a national movement to capture the interest and attention of men called the Promise Keeper. Founded by Bill Mc Cartney, former head football coach from the University of Colo rado, this organization has grown from a membership of only 4,200 in 1990 to 1997 membership of more than two million men. First, it’s clear that if you establish an organization wi th the needs of men in mind, they will join. Second, if you meet their needs in a manner that is powerful, they will make sure their friends join. The Promise Keepers offer a man an opportunity to rediscover his religion, himself, his role with his spouse and hi s family, his community and his work. If you can structure an organiza tion so that it meets the ve ry personal needs of men for their own development, and promise them benefits they want, you will have solved your membership problems. H. How do we make the joining process more appealing? Try these four steps: 1. Improve engagement: This means make an attempt to amaze and delight the new member with the quality of the experience of becoming a Mason. We engage people at a personal level by caring for them as human beings and paying attention to th eir interests and needs. 2. Better communication: More communi cation doesn’t necessarily mean more paper. It means answering his questions openly and candidly, sharing the goals of the organization and explaining the important role the new member can play. More people who left the Craft wonder what the organization was all about. 3. Know his expectations: When we unde rstand what a man wants from his membership, his expectations, we can come in a whole lot closer to providing these solutions than if we try and guess what will make him happy. All men who join appear to want to make new friends and connections. The effective leader wi ll make this possible in the lodge."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"3-6 4. Increase follow-up: We hear so often that once a man becomes a Master Mason the lodge has nothing more to do with him. How sad. This is precisely the best time to begin involving the man in his Fraternity in such a way that it brings joy a nd satisfaction to his life. I. How much value do we offer? The question should read: “How much should Masonry be worth?” Instead, we’ve added the concept of value because that’s what you need to thi nk about. Men who join, look at the initiation and the annual dues and weigh the amount ve rsus the value they get from their contribution. Are we able to say we offer more for less, or do we offer less for less? A few Masons may not appreciate this compar ison of the Fraternity to organizations like AAA Auto Club or American Express, but thes e organizations offer more for less and so should we. J. Why are first impression so important? Try this: Develop a list of first impression benefits you would like a new memb er of your lodge to sense when he first comes into your Masoni c Temple. Conduct a first-impressions audit of your lodge through the eyes of the ne w member. Develop a li st of recommended changes and a plan for achievin g them during a specified peri od of time. Form a plan to correct conditions causing bad first impressions. K. What role does the spouse play in men joining? What role does the spouse play in men join ing? It will not surp rise most men to know that wives play a critical role in the joining process. As importantly, that role has changed over the years from one of virtually no voice, to a 21 st century role where the words partnership and parity more of ten describe the wife’s role in a man’s joining behavior. When a man comes home from a meeting and his wife asks, “What happened?” and he responds “Nothing” or “Not much, just a busin ess meeting,” the wife’s next question will be “Why are you going to these meetings if you’re bored and nothing happens?” Try this: 1. Explain in precise terms the amount of additional time it takes at the beginning to both the man and to his wife. 2. Pay close attention to the wife and family early in his membership. 3. Check all lodge activities and events to see that they do not waste time."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"3-7 4. Offer degree work only at an extra meeting. 5. Aim at having meetings end early. Five reasons former members ga ve for leaving the Fraternity: 1. Masonry takes too much time. 2. It was not what I expected. 3. I was bored. Nothing ev er happened in the lodge. 4. Lodge was a very unfriendly place. 5. The lodge leadership was not up to the tasks at hand. Get more PR for the lodge. Get more invol ved and have a greater relevance in your community. Get more involved with the family. L. Summing it up 1. Men who join have very little time fo r the joining process and no time to be wasted. 2. Men who join have expect ations for joining and if you know what they are, you can do something about meeting them. 3. Men who want to join will need to have the wives’ “approval” of their membership. 4. The more concrete benefits we can offer a man for his membership, the more value we create. As the leader , creating value is your job. 5. The positive first impression he re ceives is like money in the bank. 6. Communicating with him can make all the difference in the world. 7. Fellowship and new friends are at the h eart of the reasons why most men join. 8. When you demonstrate good leadership, you are meeting two of his goals for joining, evidence of good leadership and an opportunity to lead. 9. The Promise Keepers and other organizati ons are targeting the same men we need to look at for Masonry. 10. What a man does not know about the organization can hurt you. 11. As the leader of the lodge, membership development and membership satisfaction are your two most important jobs. 12. Because the goals for membership devel opment and retention will take more than one year, you will need a multi-year plan. 13. By developing a multi-year plan for memb ership, you are more likely to achieve your goals."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"4-1 SUSPENSION CHECKLIST 1.

What you as a leader need to know Just as the manager of a store and the empl oyees are responsible for the customers they gain, so are they responsible for the customers they lose. In some retail stores, losing a customer is a cause for dismissal. As the l eader of the lodge or Masonic organization, you need to know that losing a member is your responsibility as well. It may not be your fault, but it is clearly your responsibility. B. What can we learn from men we’ve lost? One of the right things you can do as the lead er is to examine a list of those men you have \"lost\" over the last five (5) years and asse ss the reasons why they may have left your organization. Some answers may be simple: Th ey moved to a different state. The more difficult findings will include that they le ft because Freemasonry \"was not what they expected.\" Key Idea: We won't make all Masons happy when we sa y this, but you may want to concentrate only on your last five (5) ye ars of inactive or \"lost\" me mbers. After a few years of inactivity, members are in reality lost to the organization and the resources committed to renew their membership could be spent more productively in gaining and retaining new members. Try This: 1. Ask the Grand Lodge for a list of th e names and addresses of all members who have joined over th e past three years. 2. Determine which of these have become suspended. 3. If your list is not too long, contact each personally by phone and determine why their interest has waned. 4. Develop an action plan for each who gives you any sign that they might be interested in renewing their intere st and becoming active once again. 5. Inquire and make a list of all the reasons why th e member let his membership lapse. Key Idea: 1. The vast majority (66%), indicat e that Masonry was not what they expected. When asked to explain in more detail, they said they were not prepared for the initiation, it surprised them and they were uncomfortable. The initiation was very uncomfortable for many."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"4-3 2. They said that no one had told them what to expect and this made them uncomfortable and even embarrassed. 3. To learn the ritual took too much tim e away from their family or job. 4. The meetings they did attend we re too long and boring. \"Nothing happened.\" They were disappointed at the lack of effective leadership. Members were \"cliquish\" and aloof. Try This: Before you can begin to take corrective ac tions, you need to get over the \"shock\" of reading a list of circumstances that can be very damaging to the lodge. What these members were saying is that most of the earl y stages of their membership were filled with negatives. Now it is true that your l odge may have handled these issues and made the appropriate changes, but if you have not, you should use this information as a place to begin your study of why men leav e after joining. Consider: 1. Developing a more comprehensive explan ation of the initia tion and discussing it with the candidate before he experiences it. 2. Meeting with the candidate after each de gree and handling his concerns at that time. 3. Asking him frequently duri ng the first six months of his membership, \"How are you doing and what questions do you have?\" C. What do we do with this boredom thing? Let's consider this one carefully because it is at the root of many of the difficulties the lodge is facing and the solution rests square ly with the leadership of the lodge. Boredom comes from repetition and from sa meness - characteristics of too many lodges in North America. Interestingly, the leaders of the lodge do not see this in the same light as the member because they ar e at least involved in some actions related to the lodge. Members, on the other hand, simply sit out there and take it. The degree work, which admittedly does not occu r at every meeting, even when it is done very well, becomes old hat and uninteresting to the men sitting on the sidelines. It may be interesting for those on the degree team, but for the members it is a time of sameness and some men may even doze off. The evidence is clear that it does not create sufficient appeal to keep men comi ng back to the lodge. Key Idea: The solution, therefore, must lie el sewhere. Here are the key ideas: 1. Every lodge meeting - special and stated - needs to be planned around an agenda that offers interest and involvement to members. 2. Good fellowship prior to the meeting is essential."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"4-4 3. Programs that delight member s are key to their interest. 4. Regular assessments of how well you reduce boredom help. Try This: 1. Consider any of the activities in 101+ Ways to Improve Interest and Attendance in Your Masonic Lodge. 2. Appoint an active member to a lodge pr ogram team and work to develop a year- long agenda. 3. Test each suggested program against some quality measurements to see if it will \"delight\" your members. D. What are the telltale signs of losing interest? You might think this is obvious, \"he stops co ming to meetings!\" But there are some telltale signs some men display before this occurs. Early in the process, during the time he is receiving his degrees, he will appear increasingly less attentive, resist making fr iends and appear removed from the process- sure signs that he is questioning what he has joined. He will be late for scheduled classes or miss more than others. He may become removed from the group and appear shy. He will show little interest in advancing to the ne xt degree and may have to be \"pushed\" a bit to make the commitment. He may drop out of sight after the init ial degree-then you'll clearly see something's wrong. During the first several months after he ha s completed his degree work, he will avoid attending meetings, show no interest if he doe s and not volunteer for activities sponsored by the lodge. If he's married, his wife will not make appearances at lodge events and he will not make new friends among the members. He will not respond to phone calls, answer letters and may say things to hi s friends about his decision to join. After the first year, more than 80% of all new members fail to return to meetings and remain active in their lodge. 80% is a huge number and should be of concern to every Masonic leader. Something is happening that is serious and damaging to the lodge. In fact these men are all but lost to the lodge and may never return. Think about all of the time and effort you put into locating this man and making him a Mason only for him to vote with his feet that Masonry is not for him and to disappear forever. Key Idea: 1. There are right things you can and s hould do at each of these three stages. 2. Failing to take action puts all membership de velopment at risk. 3. A man begins his dissatisfaction ve ry early in the joining process. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"4-5 Try This: 1. Assign a mentor or big brother to each new member for a period of up to one year. 2. Ask each new member frequently about hi s continuing interest and satisfaction. Pay attention to what he tells you. Probe for additional details. Ask his wife if you're not sure. E. What role does the cost of membership play? Masonic leaders are often tempted to consid er the costs of Masonry as a burden to joining. Among the early strategies, some l eaders consider reducing the annual dues to some lower level hoping to reduce or eliminate the objections that it costs too much to be a Mason. The facts, however, do not support this ei ther among those men who are members or among those who are considering the organizati ons. Therefore, any attempts to increase new membership and improve retention by fina ncial methods are most likely ill advised. The facts are that it costs less to be a Mason for a year today than it does to get your newspaper delivered to your home for a month! Therefore, reducing the cost is not as significant a strategy as increasi ng the value of membership. Perpetual memberships, so popular among so me jurisdictions and in many lodges may offer what appears to be a be nefit to the member, but this one-time payment often fails to take into account the costs of inflation and the increased costs of lodge operations in a declining membership. Key Idea: The solution to declining membership, to the difficulties of locating and enrolling new members, and in retaining new members once they have joined is not related to the costs of membership in the Masonic l odge. Look elsewhere for a strategy. Try This: 1. Review the date when invoices are se nt to the home. If it's right around the holidays, consider changing the mailing date. 2. Consider increasing the dues by adding value. 3. Do an analysis of the consequences of perpetual membership and determine ways to cover the increased costs to the lodge over the average life of the agreement. 4. Develop a programmatic plan for the l odge and a budget and seek the support of the lodge to increase dues to support its implementation."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"4-6 F. What steps can YOU take wh en the signs first appear? Some people say members who are unhappy with the organization, vote with their feet. They simply don't come back. There's probabl y a lot of truth to this statement. Unhappy members don't support a volunteer organi zation. So what steps can you take if and when you learn the member is unhappy? The right course of action for th e leader of a lodge to take is to never let your customer - your member - get to the stage where he is unhappy. The other Guid es in this Handbook have been directing you to ta ke the kinds of steps to insu re his satisfaction is high from the very beginning. Here are six ideas you might want to try: 1. From the very beginning make sure your new member understands the organization he is joining, what Masons st and for and where he fits into the lodge he is joining. 2. Make him very comfortable with the rou tine of lodge, the words and grip that will be part of his recognition, the protocol of lodge and the way he addresses lodge and Grand Lodge officers. 3. Make sure he is at home and comfortabl e - never looking lost . Introduce him to a man his age and help him make new friends. 4. If he misses a meeting, ask a friend to call him and find out why. If he's new to the area, call him yourself. 5. Demonstrate your interest in meeting hi s needs by finding out what they are. 6. Ask him to help out in your lodge with something you have planned. Asking him to show an interest in the chairs may not be a right move this early in the process. Key Idea: Even though he has joined of his own free w ill and accord, this does not mean we can ignore his needs. As a member he needs the nourishment of a sapling tree until his roots are fixed firm into the organization. Try This: Consider developing a mini- action plan around any of th e six points mentioned above and implementing these activities in your l odge. Use the Lodge Membership Satisfaction Form."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"4-7 Lodge Member Satisfaction Form State Need Lodge Mini Action Steps Make sure your new member understands the organization he is joining, what Masons stand for and where he fits into the lodge he is joining. Make him very comfortabl e with the routine of lodge, the words and grip that will be part of his recognition, the prot ocol of lodge and the way he addresses lodge and Grand Lodge officers. Make sure he is at home and comfortable - never looking lost. Intr oduce him to men his age and help him make new friends. If he misses a meeting, ask a friend to call him and find out why. If he's new to the area, call him yourself. Demonstrate your interest in meeting his needs by finding out what they are. Ask him to help out in your lodge with something you have planned. Asking him to show an interest in the chairs may not be a right move this early in the process. G. How can we enlist others to save the man? There are probably only three people who can effectively make a difference with a man who has begun to lose interest in the Craft. In reality, none of them will be really effective if the man has decided he doesn't want to be a member. Let's begin with who can make the most imme diate difference. You. As the leader of the lodge, you have the ability to make his member ship meaningful, inte resting and exciting. You and your members working together can overcome almost any objection. If he is moving, working the night shift, totally w ithout resources or other conditions, you probably will need to consider other arrangements. But if he is too lazy or too bored, you can overcome these objections. This handbook is filled with the \"how's\" to do this. His friends can make a difference. His reco mmender, his buddies, those he has met since he joined and others with whom he is close in the lodge can take him aside and be helpful in resolving his concerns. It may be as simp le as needing a ride or help explaining the organization to his wife and family. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"4-8 His family: wife, children, father, mother and relatives who understand the organization and support his involvement can answer hi s questions and support and encourage his involvement. Key Idea: The important consideration is that his contin ued interest and involvement needs to be \"of his own free will and accord.\" Just as it was when he joined. Pressuring a man to come back to lodge or asking others to bring pressu re will not be as effective as learning of his concerns and needs and taking actio ns to increase his satisfaction. Try This: 1. Try to determine the single most important reason for his loss of interest and activity. 2. Speak with a close friend or his wife to see where you may have missed an opportunity you can still salvage. 3. If you don't know where to begin, cons ider saying to this member, \"Look, it seems we may not have handled your member ship well up to this point. What is there that I can do personally that will make a difference in your decision to leave.\" H. Summing it up It may sound negative to end this Handbook with a section on losing members. But every enterprise that has members or customers has to have a contingency plan to handle those situations when a customer or member no longer appears satisfied and supportive of the enterprise. We have offered leaders of Masonic lodges the following key ideas and suggestions. 1. As the leader of a Masonic organi zation, membership retention is your responsibility. 2. Members who leave the organization can provide valuable insights into the reasons why the organization is not fulfilling the expectations. 3. Boredom and \"sameness\" are critical c oncerns in many lodges and the leader has to take action to eliminate both. 4. The effective leader can tell when a member is not satisfied by observing his behavior - principally his attendance and aloofness. 5. The Imperial Shrine has research that clearly defines reasons why men become dissatisfied and fail to renew their membership! 6. Cost of membership - particularly the annua l dues - is not in a nd of itself reason for most men to let their membership lapse. 7. The effective leader can learn a great deal by having a one-on-one with his members. 8. Taking actions when the first signs of dissa tisfaction appear is critical to changing his direction."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"4-9 9. Other members should be asked to solve retention issues. 10. Phase II research completed by the Masonic Renewal Task Force gives vital information about why men are not happy with their membership. 11. One-day classes present oppor tunities and challenges. 12. Time plays a critical role in member satisfaction and interest. 13. Members who have been inactive for year s should be approached very carefully. We can learn about members by watching how businesses handle customers. Lost members can create significant bad will. I. Delinquent Members The increasing numbers of Masons being susp ended for non-payment of dues each year is alarming. While we must actively work on procuri ng new members, we must also be careful to see that once they have joined the Fraternity, th ey will not become dise nchanted and show up on the suspension list after a few years. The Lodge Chairman assigned to RETENTIONS s hould obtain from the Secretary a list of all Members who are in arrears. Th is should be done shortly after the beginning of each year. A letter from the Master of the Lodge to those Members on the list to advise that th eir dues are in arrears and to encourage remittance of same . (See sample letter # 1 page 36a and 36b). A follow-up letter from the Master of the Lodge could be sent to t hose who have not yet responded after a certain period of time (left up to the Lodge). (See sample letter #2 page 36c). For the Members who have still not responde d, the most successful method is PERSONAL CONTACT – either in person or by phone – A lthough the Master, other officers of the Lodge, or a Past Master, could contact the Member, perhap s it is best for his pet ition signers (if possible) or a member of the Membership Committee. Pref erably a Member who is acquainted with him should make contact. In some cases, a Brother is unable to pay his dues because of financial reasons. In these situations, the Lodge could remit his dues as provided by the \"Millennium Fund.\" Remember, the Masonic principals of brotherly love, reli ef and truth should not allow a member to be dropped from the roles for non-payment of dues. The names of those who are in need of assistance must be maintained in the strictest of confidence. These are but some guidelines the Lodge Membership Committee may use to assist them in retaining their members. Additional dues notices ma y be sent, as well as developing a letter to send to the Brothers who signed the delinquent member’s petition. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"4-10 THE “MILLENNIUM FUND” Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth A “Millennium Fund,” if established in each Nebraska Lodge, would accomplish two important goals by practicing charity am ong our brothers and our local community, both important Masonic teachings. The monies received by the Millennium Fund w ould first, pay for the annual Grand Lodge per capita for members who, for whatever reason, have not paid their annual dues. It may be that a brother is in a care fac ility, has health problems, is financially distressed, or simply that he has not been brought into the fellowship of the Frater nity. It would not be considered Masonic to drop these members from the membership rolls. To do so, they would lose several important benefits: their right to apply for admission into the Nebraska Masonic Home, eligibility for membership awards, membership in appendant bodi es, availability of Ma sonic Funeral Services, and all rights and privileges normally a fforded a Master Mason in good standing. After taking care of your own me mbers, the remaining funds could be used to augment annual fundraising projects for the lodge to be used in the communit y, such as scholarships and community charities, or carried forward for future remissions.
