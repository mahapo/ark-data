T EE early demand for the Fifth Edition of SHIBBOLETH, a demand the publishers scarcely anticipated in times like these, affords the author an opportunity to add several important matters to the volume, thus rendering it still more valuable to the Order of the Temple. So far as now seen this edition is a complete Monitor. This edition contains all that appeared in the Fourth Edi - tion, with a few errors corrected, and the Banners of Judah and Persia. There is also added a “Third Appendix,” which contains directions for the Reception of Grand Officers; Hints to Eminent Commanders, and Rules of Order; Rituals for Divine Worship; Ritual of a Conclave of Sorrow; Ritual for the Christmas Observance; a Form for Recorder’s Min - utes; an Arrangement of Asylum and Prelate’s Hall; and some Hints on Templar Banquets. This Monitor reaches farther in its helpfulness than any that has been prepared heretofore. But it has not attempted to describe the Robes, and other equipments not universally accepted by the Order. Many requests have been made for the insertion of such descriptive matter, and the requests have been declined in the interests of peace. Such an attempt would develop acrimonious controversies. My thanks are due, and they are hereby returned to the Fratres all over the Union, from Maine to Mexico, and the Atlantic to the Pacific, for the kind reception gi’i~en the former editions of this Monitor, and for the many valuable hints received from all sources. It is the author’s sincere desire to make this volume complete in all respects, and he will still be grateful for all suggestions looking to such com - pleteness.

Only a few days later he was forced by dis - ease to the chamber of death, which he never again left until the end came. ~rhe expression of his thanks in the last paragraph may therefore be taken as his loving farewell to his brethren; and it is believed that his earnest desire to provide a Moni - tor that should be complete and helpful to the members of the Order has been fully realized in this new edition of SHIBBOIIEtH, to the preparation of which were given the last of his labors on earth.

TT is the earnest desire of the author of this Monitor to discover -‘ that all the Coinmanderies invest the beautiful, instructive and entertaining Order of the Red Cross with the interest its importance demands. The Ritual provides ample opportunity for the display of true dramatic taste, both in robing and in reading. It also presents the great central thought of the Order, —TRUTH, —as it has never been presented previous to the adoption at Denver. The feeling had become almost universal that the Order of the Red Cross was of slight importance, and was at best little more than a social observance. Hence the ceremonials were hurried over, the candidate was practically told that it was mere matter of form, and he went away profoundly impressed that the Commandery was indeed a jovial institution. Never was a graver mistake, and the impression so made was more injurious than beneficial. The Ritual now adopted can not fail to correct that erroneous view of the value of the Order. The Order of the Red Cross should, if possible, be conferred upon classes, and be made the occasion of social intercourse among the members; the healing of wounds, the forming of new bonds of fra - ternity. The lessons of the ceremonies tend to these noble ends, and by conferring them with the dignity and pathos they merit those ends will be assuredly attained. See with what fervor of gratitude the newly created Companions will hereafter refer to the name they assumed, and the character they represented. There can be no nobler, and if the work is done with the devotion to dramatic effects which the Ritual demands, that name and character will never be forgotten."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 TEMPLAR MONITOR. Hence the propriety of the Refection at the close of the work of the Council. Commanders will advance the interests of the bodies they govern by securing full paraphernalia and equipments. The robes need not be expensive, but should be appropriate. It is of the greatest impor - tance that the Grand Council, Companion Conductor, Warder and Guards be in Jewish robes and turbans. It is equally important that the Persian Guards should wear a uniform different from that of the Order of the Red Cross, an Order not then founded, technically speaking. The Princes of Persia and the Rul - era of Media should wear oriental r o be s, and the Master of Cavalry should also be in Persian dress. The Sovereign Master, Prince Chancellor and Prince Master of the Pal aee wear the regulation robes. The seating of the Princes and Rulers, fully robed, should be in such form as to produce the b e st effects upon the Jewish Prince.

ORDER OF THE RED CROSS. ~HE learned Sir Alfred Creigh, ‘whose name is a household word -~. among American Knights Templar, used the following language in a report to the Grand Commandery of Pennsylvania, September, 1867: “The Ritual of the Red Cross was manufactured by Webb and his associates from kindred degrees not of this Order. It requires no argument to demonstrate that this degree has no connection whatever with the orders of Chrt~ti~n knighthood, nor never should have been incorporated into an order whose sublime teachings are of Jesus as the Redeemer of the world—in his mediatorial character, as the way, the truth and the life.” The equally scholarly and thoughtful Sir George S. Blackie made a report to the Grand Commandery of Tennessee, May 9, 1871, in which he used the following strong language: “The inconsistency is glaring — the ceremonies are foreign to Christian knighthood. How utterly out of place does the Christian candidate appear when, as a preliminary to the glorious truths of the New Testament, he is introduced b a Jewish Sanhedrin, captured by pagan soldiers, and after having teen entertained with an apocryphal legend at the banquet of a pagan monarch, he is sent out into the world without having heard of the name of Christ.” The itnanirnous adoption of the revised Ritual of the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross by the Grand Encampment, in Denver, on August lo, 1892, explains and settles the misconceptions of these dear Fratres forever, and yet a few words may not be out of place at this time. The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross is not a pagan rite, nor is it a mere social observance. It is an Order founded upon TRUTH, recognizing the GOD 01’ TRUTH as the only one true and living God. As such it is a proper preparation for the solemnities of the Order of the Temple. Darius believed in the same one God that Israel did when he registered a vow with that God to rebuild His Temple in the de -"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. II stroyed city of Jerusalem. No doubt he registered that vow under the promptings of his Jewish friend, Prince Zerubbabel, who was the recognized Chosen of God. Darius kept that vow, demonstrating his love of TRU~rH and his reverence for Judah’s Jehovah. The most exalted TRU~rH was present implicitly, in Judaism, and the Law of Judaism was the schoolmaster that brought us to Chris - tianity. The most exalted Thuri is now explicit in Christianity. In Judaism it was the seed, then the blade, and then Christianity ripened it into the ear. So is the TRUrH of all truths implicitly in the Order of the Red Cross, and the candidate finds that same truth, but explicitly, in the Order of the Temple. As Judaism was a preparation for Christianity, so let the Illustri - ous Order of the Red Cross be a preparation for the Christian Order of the Temple. HISTORICAL SKETCH. The Scriptures inform us that for their own sins, and those of their forefathers, the Jewish people were led into captivity by Nebu - zaradan, chief Captain of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon. As slaves they tilled the valleys of the Euphrates, and of the Tigris, until Cyrus destroyed the Chaldean dynasty. During that captivity Zerubbabel, Crown Prince of the House of Judah, and Darius, son of Hystaspes, formed an alliance of friendship which was probably terminated with death only. One of the first acts of the conqueror Cyrus was the liberation of the Jewish captives; he then permitted them to return to Judea, that they might rebuild the city of Jerusalem and its Temple, which Neb - uchadnezzar had destroyed. The foundation stone of the Second Temple was laid 535 years before Christ; Zerubbabel, the Royal Prince, Joshua, the High Priest, and Haggai, the Prophet, laying the same. Cyrus died, and his son, Cambyses, succeeded him on the Medo - Persian throne. On complaint of the Cutheans, and other contiguous tribes, Cambyses commanded the work upon the city and Temple to cease. During the nine years that followed, scarcely anything was done on the walls of Jerusalem, or its Temple. Cambyses died and the Magians seized the throne, from which their usurper was driven with great slaughter, in a little over a year. Then the Seven Great ramilies of Persia laid hold of the govern - ment, and Darius ascended the throne. He appointed Zerubbabel,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 TEMPLAR MONITOR. his friend, to be the Governor of the Jews that had returned to Jeru - salem under the decree of the great Cyrus, and afterwards made him stand in the royal bed-chamber, as the Guard of his body. There were three of these Guards, and they were chosen because of the monarch’s implicit confidence in their loyalty. Fifteen years after the Jews had laid the foundation of the Second Temple they were forced to call a Grand Council to consult about the state of the country. Cambyses was dead, and the Magian usurper, Smerdis, had been driven from the throne, to give place to Darius, son of Hystaspes, whose favoring of the Jews was believed to be almo&t as marked as was that of the great Cyrus. Darius spread a feast at his capital, and invited thereto the Princes of Persia and the Rulers of the Medes. That feast having been thor - oughly enjoyed, “they every one departed to go to bed at their own houses, and Darius, the King, went to bed.” The King slept lightly, and awakening he fell into conversation with his three Guards. He suggested, as a part of the festivities of the morrow, that they three engage in a public discussion of some interesting question, as had been the custom on similar occasions from time immemorial, and that he would reward with a princely gift the successful contestant The King then proposed the follow - ing question: “Whether Wine was not the strongest? Whether Kings were not such? Whether Women were not such, or whether TRUTH was not strongest of all?” Esdras makes the Guards suggest both the questions and the prize, but we follow the story as related by Josephus. Again the King slept, aiid the Guards prepared for the contest of the morning. When the King arose he sent for the Princes and Rul - ers to meet him in the Audience Chamber, and witness the contest between his Guards. This contest began, in time, by one of the Guards declaiming in favor of the strength of \\Vine, followed by another in favor of the power of the King. Then the Jew, Zerubbabel, contended for the supremacy of Woman, concluding with a noble deliverance in favor of TRUTH. The brilliant assembly burst forth into applause when Zerubbabel concluded, and the King awarded him the prize in these words: “Ask for somewhat over and above what I have promised, for I would give it unto you because of your wisdom.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 13 Then “Zerubbabel put him in mind of the vow he had made in case he should ever have the kingdom. Now this vow was to build Jerusalem, and to rebuild therein the Temple of God, as also to re - store the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged and carried to Babylon.” And behold the King was pleased to arise and to kiss his eloquent Guard, and to grant his request. Zerubbabel returned to his peo - ple in Jerusalem with great joy, and the rebuilding of the city and Temple was immediately resumed. Darius not only kept his vow, but he made large contributions to the rebuilding out of the royal treasury. The details adapted to more beautifully round out the drama, and to more pointedly teach the lesson of the almighty force and the importance of TRUTH are esoteric.

THE RECORDS OF OUR FATHERS. Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubba - bel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levite~.. and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jeru - salem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the Lord. Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Cadni!eJ and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward t~ workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, wi/h their Sons and their brethren the Levites. And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Le - vites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord; because he is good, for his mercy endure/h forever to - ward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid. Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel; then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacri - lice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath com - manded us. Then the people of the land weakened the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. ‘9 hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in build - ing, and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Je - rusalem. And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was Written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue. Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy ser - vants the men on this side of the river, and at such a time. Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebel - lions and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations. Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. Now because we have maintenance from (he king’s palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king; that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portioii on this side the river. Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 TEMPLAR MONITOR. dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time. The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all coun - tries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them. Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me. Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? Now when the copy of king Artaxcrxes’ let - ter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. * * * * * * PLEDGES OF FIDELITY. * * * * * * THE SWORD.

The road from Jerusalem to Susa, the chief treasury of Persia, and one of the favorite cities of the Persian kings, lay in part through the country restored to the Jews by the decree of Cyrus, but after crossing the Euphrates it was entirely in the domain of King Darius. Indeed, a more cautious statement would limit the Jewish country to west of the Jordan. The Jews attempted, in an embarrassed way, to picket their own country, and to provide passes with which to distinguish their friends. The domain of the Persian monarch was under strict military surveil-. lance, and countersigus were absolutely necessary to travel therein with safety. Darius lived in daily dread of spies and secret enemies from among the defeated, though not destroyed, Magian~.

O ye Princes and Rulers, how exceeding strong is Wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it; it maketh the mind of the King and the beggar to be all one; of the boudman and freeman, of the poor man and the rich; it turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remem - bereth neither sorrow nor debt; it changeth and elevateth the spirits, and enliveneth the heavy hearts of the miserable. It maketh a man forget his brethren and draw his sword against his best friends. 0 ye Princes and Rulers, is not Wine the strongest, that forceth us to do these things?"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 23 THE POWER OF THE KING. It is beyond dispute, 0 Princes and Rulers, that God has made man master of all things under the sun; to command them, to make use of them, and to apply them to his service as he pleases; but, whereas men have only dominion over other sublunary creatures, Kings have an authority even over men themselves, and a right of ruling them by will and pleasure. Now, he that is master of those who are masters of all things else, hath no earthly thing above him. * * * * 4C * THE INFLUENCE OF WOMAN. 0 Princes and Rulers, the force of wine is not to be de - nied, neither is that of Kings, that unites so many men in one common bond of allegiance; but, the supereminency of Woman is yet above all this: for Kings are but the gifts of women, and they are also the mothers of those that culti - vate our vineyards. Women have power to make us aban - don our very country and relations, and many times to for - get the best friends we have in the world, and, forsaking all other comforts, to live and die with them. But when all is said, neither they, nor Wine, nor Kings are comparable to the almighty force of Truth. As for all other things, they are mortal and transient, but Truth alone is unchangeable and everlasting; the ben - efits we receive from it are subject to no variations or vicis - situdes of time or fortune.

Alexander destroyed it, and Darius Hystaspes is supposed to have founded it. To-day its ruins stand in the valley of Schiraz, the wonder of the world. These ruins are an immense platform, fifty feet above the plain, hewn partly out of the mountain itself, the remainder built of marble blocks from twenty to sixty feet in length, so nicely fitted together that the joints are scarcely dis - cernible to-day. This platform is fourteen hundred feet long, and nine hundred feet wide, and faces the four quarters of the world. The ascent from the plain is made by marble steps, passing colossal figures, until you reach the gigantic columns, with their beautiful capitals, twelve to fifteen feet in circumference, and fifty feet high, which supported the cedar roof that protected the residents from the hot sun. And there you see rows of carved images, men of every nation and clime. This was the palace of Darius. To this palace Ahasuerus may have brought his fair Jewish wife, Esther, from Tusa, and from there had her condu&ed to the other palace still farther up the mountain, which the drunken Alexander burned 33. C. 330. SUSA, or SHUSHAN.—SO named because of the lilies that abounded in the valley. In Daniel’s time it was in possession of the Babylo - nians, but when Cyrus conquered Babylon he transferred it to Persia. It was from this city of Shushan that Darius issued his decree for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and its Temple, it being the winter resi - dence of Darius, and of all the Persian kings after Cyrus. In grat - itude for this decree the Jews called the eastern gate of the Second Temple the Gate of Shushan. It is said that a resemblance of the city of Shushan was engraved upon that gate. EcBATANA.—This was a city of the Medes, a beautiful place, and after the union of the Medes and Persians became a favorite summer residence of the Persian monarchs. In this city is shown to-day the tombs of Mordecai and Esther, but why they should have been interred in that city is a mystery."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 TEMPLAR MONITOR. It was in Ecbatana that Cyrus held his capital, and in its archives, therefore, was found the roll which proved to Darius that Cyrus had made a decree allowing the Jews to rebuild the Temple. It is held by many that it was in this city of Ecbatana that Zoro - aster made his first appearance. THE RELIGION OF THE ANCIENT PERSIANS. Up to the seizure of the throne by Smerdis the Magian religion was dominant among the Medes and Persians. That religion abom - inated the worship of images, as Judaism did, and worshiped the One God only by fire. This religion fell into disgrace when its chief, Smerdis, was driven from the throne with such awful slaughter. Darius was a Magian at that time, and for some time afterwards. Sabianism was idolatry, the opposite of Magianism, but it gained favor on the disgrace of the Magians. This religion consisted chiefly in the worship of the host of heaven,—hence the name from Isaba, host,—and the worship of the planets. In his later life this reUgion became so powerful that Darius gave it his adherence."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 29 CONCLUDING REMARKS. Acti labores jucundi. THE captives released under the decree of the great Cyrus, issued B. C. 536, entered the desolated city of Jerusalem on the 20th day of Tebeth, B. C. 535, under the leadership of Zerubbabel. On the 23d day of Adar, B. C. 515, the Second Temple was completed. It was dedicated, and the Priests and Levites assigned to their duties. The second installment of returning captives entered Jerusalem on the ioth of Schebet, B. C. 458, under the leadership of Ezra. He began a reforiuatiou of the people by compelling them to put away their unbelieving wives. The poor, impoverished, rain-soaked people obeyed the imperative commands of this lineal descendant of Aaron when they had assembled themseves in the city, five months after - wards. They put away the wives they had brought up with them from Babylon, kept a solemn fast, and entered into a covenant to walk in God’s law, as given them by his servant Moses. The third installment entered Jerusalem, under the guidance of Nehemiah, B. C. 445, when Nehemiah became Governor. Those who, for various reasons, preferred to remain in the Persian country, were henceforth known as “The Dispersion.” On the first day of Nisan, B. C. 445, a solemn fast was held, by order of Nehemiah, and on the 24th day of the same month there was another. At these Ezra read the Book of the Law of Moses to the people, and after seven days they “rejoiced and feasted as they had not done since the days of Joshua, the son of Nun.” It was then they covenanted to keep the seventh day, and the seventh year. Thus was Israel re-established in Jerusalem, and the city and its Temple rebuilt. Other cities were built, and peace was within their walls, and prosperity within their palaces. The ceremonials of the fllustrious Order of the Red Cross furnish ample scope for the best of elocutionary work.

A true Mason will lay down his life rather than surrender his in - tegrity. A Companion of the Red Cross holds his engagements sacred and inviolable, and will not accept favors or emoluments at the sacri - fice of his integrity. Nor will he draw his sword in the cause of In - justice, Falsehood, or Oppression, for JusTIcE, TRUTH, and LIBERTY are the Grand Characteristics of that Illustrious Order. Endurance, coupled with faith and perseverance, is a shining char - acteristic of a Companion of the Red Cross. He is taught a lesson he never forgets in the secession of the Ten Tribes of Israel, when told by Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, that his father chastised them with whips, but that he would chastise them with scorpions. They withdrew from their allegiance, and left the tribes of JUDAH and BENJAMIN in possession of Jerusalem, its Temple, and the tradi - tions. Thcir lack of patience and endurance, under such trying cir - cumstances, resulted in their disappearance as tribes, or as a people. And to-day the Jews, scattered all over the face of the earth, claim descent from the two patient tribes, —Judah and Benjamin. Those who seek to destroy their neighbors often overreach them - selves as did that Governor and nobleman of the Medo-Persian domain, —TATNAI and SHETHAR-BOZNAI. The search among the archives, in Ecbatana, which they petitioned Darius to have made, resulted in the discovery of the Decree made by Cyrus, which overthrew their hopes of preventing the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its Temple. God often causes the wrath of man to praise him. There is carved upon the Corner-Stone of the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross this Motto: “VElUTAs pr~’valebi/.” And surely an Order so grounded is of infinite importance to the human family. Verily, TRUTH will prevail. A Companion of the Red Cross has engraven upon his escutcheon these words: “LIBERTAS et na/ale solum)’ Can such a man be other than a good citizen?

It was the ensign of the ancient Kings of the Medo-Persian empire, of Persia and Babylon. The device was adopted by Charlemagne to denote the union of the black eagle of the east with the golden eagle of the west, typifying the “Holy Roman Empire.” Sceptre (Greek, skeptron; Hebrew, shebet) means rod of command, or staff of authority. It is the sign of power and authority, and is therefore to be preferred, in the Creation of a Companion, to the use of a Sword. This was the promise: Zerubbabel was appointed Governor, or Tirshatha (Ezra ii: 63), of Judah by Darius. Of Zerubbabel God said: “Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?” Hagg~ai ii 2, 3. “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it.” Zechariah iv: 9.

HISTORY OF THE ORDER OF THE. TEMPLE. TN the year of our Lord iiiS the following gentlemen formed them - ~ selves into a society, in the city of Jerusalem, whose duty it was to escort pilgrims to and from the Holy City, through the mountain defiles and dangerous passes, en route, viz.: Hugh de Payen, a gen - tleman named Rossal, Godfrey de St. Omer, Godfrey Bissol, Payen de Montdidier, Archambaud de Saint-Aignan, and two gentlemen named D’Andre and De Gondemare, respectively. These eight were joined by Hugh of Champagne seven years later. And the sodety thus formed was without rules, and its members wore no parth LIlar habit. They lived in a house close by the Temple, and soon came to be known as Knights of the Temple, and Templars. That house was a part of the palace of the western kings, which had been set apart as the home of the pilgrims, anti their guards. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was the chapel of the new society. Hugh de Payen went to Rome in 1127 to ask of Pope Honorius II a new crusade, and while there besought his Holiness to form the little society at Jerusalem into a religious and military order. The Pope referred him to the Council of Troyes, then in session, which appointed St. Bernard to draw up rules for the Order, and prescribe for it a dress. The white dress prescribed by St. Bernard had a red cross aided by Pope Eugenius III, year3 afterwards. The name assumed by this society is not known to us with perfect accuracy. They were known as “The Brethren of the Order of the Temple,” and as “Brethren of the Soldiery of the Temple,” and as “Brethren of the Temple.” They were referred to as “Pauperes 3"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 TEMPL A!? MONITOR. Commili/ones Chris/i el Templi Solomon is.” It is supposed that their armorial bearing of two knights riding one horse referred to this poverty, but that is not certain. Neither is it clear that the bear - ing alluded to “Brotherly Love,” or even to “Humility.” True they were vowed to chastity, poverty, and obedience, but the king sup - plied all their wants in the beginning, and the Order soon began to revel in opulence. The enthusiasm which this society of nine gallant young gentle - men aroused all over Christendom tells the story of the popular craze. The Pope, Prelates, King3, and all the people, praised their chivalry, and eager youths clamored for admission to their ranks. The Pope promised heaven to all who would take the Cross against the Saracens. Kings settled rich estates upon the new Order, on which Priories were founded. The Order increased in numbers with astounding rapidity. They weje young nobles of hot blood, of sin - ews of steel, and of great physical endurance. These became Temp - lars knowing that they were to be forever upon the field, and never to know peace. The Templars had no lady-love save Mary, Queen of Heaven; they wore no ornaments, their hair was to be kept short, and their dress plain white. They were to eat two and two at the same table, so that each might know that the other did not fast, which was strictly forbidden. They were to attend chapel services, but if on duty at that time they might say their prayers in bed. They were to hold no correspondence with the outer world, nor could a Brother walk alone. Amusements were not encouraged, and all conversation was serious. The Templar had no personal wealth, and if he was taken prisoner by the Saracen he was to be left to his fate, —no ran - som could be paid for him. The Templar well knew that his fate was the alternative of the Koran or the sword. Hugh de Payen took three hundred such men back to Jerusalem with him, and before five years had passed every one of these had been killed. The Hospitalers, which had been organized into a military order by Godfrey de Bouillon, became envious of the reputation of the Templars, and dissensions arose, though both frequently fought gal - lantly side by side against the common enemy. The dissensions began as early as 1179, and continued, with frequent reconciliations, until the suppression of tlic Order of the Temple, in ‘314. In 1251 the two Orders actually fought a battle, in which the Templars were almost cut to pieces. But their decimated ranks were speedily filled."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 35 We need not attempt to give even a summary of the great battles that were fought by the Templars, or recite even instances of their almost superhuman prowess. Time and space would fail us. Princes came to fear them, and bishops to hate them. What cared they? They were rich; there were no scandals afloat; they were both churchmen and warriors; their nation was the Catholic Church; their only chief the Pope. They mixed in no struggles unless the Pope’s interests were involved; their persons were sacred. They ever held up the Cross against the Crescent. They were proportion - ally hated, and tbeir counsels were rejected when they could have secured by treaty free access to Jerusalem, and peace with the Soldans in the last crusade. Poor William of Sonnac! His eye had just been dashed out, and he hastened to plead with the Christian chiefs to enter into treaty. His advice was scorned. Then dashing the blood from his eyeless socket 1i~ tii~hed to horse, and wildly shouted, “BeaQceant to the front! Beauceant and death!” He and all his companions fell sword in hand that day. Aye, there never was known a Templar who was a coward. In 1301 Boniface III was Pope, and Philip the Fair was King of France. A feud broke out between them, Boniface claiming temporal power in France. The Templars, as usual, stood by the Pope, and they sent him funds. Boniface died within two years, and his suc - cessor, Benedict XI, died within the year of his exaltation. This was the opportunity for Philip, who by intriguing and promises secured the election of the ambitious Archbishop of Bordeaux. He assumed the tiara under the title of Clement V. He had agreed to live in France, and was to do the bidding of Philip. Clement approved the demand which Philip had made upon the priests for subsidies, and said nothing about the Templars being compelled to likewise submit to these taxations. In fact, Philip had called Boniface “His Fatuity” in place of “His Holiness,” and burned the Pope’s Bull of Excom - munication with great eclat. Then he made a prisoner of the Holy Father, which created a great scandal. Clement V was wiser than Boniface III, and Philip had in him an unswerving ally when he sought to suppress the Templars, who sided with his enemy, Boniface III, and desired to gather into the treasury of rraiice the immense riches of that Order. The Templars never suspected for a moment that their only master, the Pope, ‘would betray them; and, in fact, had not a suspicion of their danger. They lived so haughtily apart from all the world that no hint of the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 TEMPLAR MONITOR. King’s desire to procure testimony against them reached their ears. But it reached the ears of others, among whom were two renegades, one a Knight Templar disgraced from the dignity of Prior, the other a member of the Order dismissed for infamous impieties. These wretches were Esquin von riorian, Prior of Montfaucon, the other one Noffodei. They were in prison at Paris, and under sentence of death. These villains informed their jailer that if their lives were spared they would put the King in possession of the secret impieties of the Templars. The King examined them himself, and the revelations they made, among others, were: i. The ‘remplars were more like Mohammedans than Christians. 2. The Novices were required to deny Christ, and to spit upon the Cross. 3. The TempIar~ wor5hiped idols, d’~’ iscd the sacianients, inur - dered, and secretly buried all betrayers of their secrets, and prac - ticed theft and sodomy. 4. The Templars betrayed the Holy Land, to the Infidels. Philip took down these accusations, and pretended to believe them, although he knew that no intimation of such crimes had even been whispered in any of the states of Christendom, in which the Templars lived and held rich preceptoi-ies. We may well spare the reader a recital of the deceptions, misrep - resentations, hypocrisy and falsehoods that attended the so-called inquiries made into those charges by the Pope and his bishops. De Molai had been to see the Pope, in response to an affectionate letter from His Holiness, although the charges were in his hands over a year before writing so affectionately. The Pope did not allude to the accusations, and De Molai had not heard of them. The Grand Master came with a band of trusted Knights, and twelve mules laden with chests of gold and silver. The wily Philip received him with - out signs of displeasure. It was now 1306, nearly two years since the accusations had been made. Rumors at last reached the Grand Master, and he grew uneasy. He went again to the Pope (1307) taking with him the four rrench preceptors, and earnestly denied the stories that he had heard. The Pope dismissed him as if he believed the Order innocent. The conduct of both the Pope and the King lulled the Templars to absolute security all over rrance, and they continued to live on in haughty and friendless isolation until the morning of October i3,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 37 1307, when every Templar in rrance was seized in his bed and carried to prison. The King gave the secret order of arrest, and the bishops, whom die Templars had so long defied, cordially co-operated, and flung them into their ~ilthy dungeons. Let us omit the farce of a trial, and relate some incideuts. The prisoners died rapidly of hutiger and exposure while being plied with promises of liberty if they would confess the guilt of the Grand Mas - ter, and of the Order. They were assured that the Grand Master had already confessed. A few said “yes,” but the mass denied the infa - mous accusations. Many cried out,—” If the Grand Master so con - fessed he lied in his throat.” These were brutally tortured, and thirty- six of them perished in the tortures. Some broke down and confessed, but withdrew the confession wheu the tortures had ceased. The poor Pope in horror protested, but the King accused him of trying to con - ceal the guilt of the Order. The inquiry went on. traitors confessed, Templars were deceived, and came to Paris under lying promises. It is probable that under torture De Molai, an old man, emaciated by brutal treatment in prison, confessed to the guilt of the Order. But before the Church Commission he appeared stupefied when he heard the confession read. He cried out that the confession was false, averring that he could stand boiling, roasting, or even killing, but that prolonged tortures were beyond human endurance. His hands had been crushed until the blood ran from his nails. Others had had their feet held to the fire until they had dropped off. Con - fessions were made, and almost immediately withdrawn. A squabble arose between the Papal Commission and the Court of the Arch - bishop of Sens. This latter court assumed jurisdiction, and burned fifty-four of the Templars in one batch, on the spot where afterwards stood the infamous Bastile. The Commission mildly objected, and finally agreed upon a report that the Order of the Temple had dis - graced itself, and should be suppressed. Pope Clement V approved the recommendation, and the Order was officially suppressed. The tragic end of Grand Master De Molal is worthy of permanent record. The Bull of Suppression was read on a platform set up in the Cathedral Church, on March x8, 1314, and in the presence of the Grand Master and the Priors of rrance and Aquitaine. When the Cardinal read the vile charges De Molai cried with a loud voice that they were false, but the two Priors, terrified by death at the stake, adhered to their confessions. On the edge of the platform DeMolai spoke: “I declare before heaven and earth, and I avow, although to"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 TEMPLAR MONITOR. my eternal shame, that I have committed the greatest of all crimes; but only by acknowledging the truth of those so foully charged against an Order, of which the truth to-day compels me to say that Order is innocent. The feafful spectacle that fronts nie can not make me con - firm a first lie by a second. Upon a condition so infamous, I heartily renounce a life already hateful to me.” As the sun went down that same evening the Grand Master per - ished in the flames on the island in the Seine, professing the inno - cence of the Order, and welcoming to the same fate one of the Priors who feared to stand by him in the cathedral, but who rallied, and died beside •him. It is said that the dying Grand Master summoned both King and Pope to meet him at the judgment. Clement died within a few weeks, in great physical agony, and a vicious horse sent the cruel Philip to his account within a year thereafter. So ended the ancient Order of the TemplarR They werc needed no longer, since Palestine had been abandoned to the Infidel. “Em - pires, monarchies, guilds, orders, societies, religious creeds, rise in the same way, and disappear when they stand in the way of other things.” HISTORY OF THE ORDER IN THE UNITED STATES. “It would be a matter of pride and gratification,” said Past Grand Master Hopkins, in his report to Grand Encampment, in 1889, “if we could trace the genealogy of our Templar organizations, by clear and unquestionable steps, back to a legitimate and respected parentage. But as that can not be done—as the very baptismal record of our Grand Encampment has been found to be erroneous—and so many subordinate bodies were formed without formality and without legal - ity, we can only admit the established facts, and trust that the power, the purity, and the renown of our maturer years may soften the dis - appointment occasioned by the knowledge of an unfortunate origin.” The Grand Encampment was formed on the 20th of June, i8i6, by delegates from the Grand Commanderies (then called Encampments) of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"CONCLAVES AND GRAND MASTERS OF TH~ GRAND ENCAMPMENT. x x x x x x x x x xo ii 12 13 14 15 i6 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 CONCLAVES.

Perhaps a literal rendering of the verse quoted above will cast some light on that one method. “In a lot-vase the lots are shaken in all directions; nevertheless, from the Lord is their whole decision, —judgment.” The Order of the Temple has adopted a method of “casting lots” peculiar to itself. And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the dis - ciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) Men and brethren, the scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. 1~or he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 63 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of ini - quity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.

For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishopric let another take. Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with. us of his resurrection.

These began with an unarmed pilgrimage in the direction of the Holy Shrine. An escort was furnished to guide and protect him.

But day after day his manhood asserted itself with accumulating vig&, when he beheld indignities offered not only to himself, but to other helpless pilgrims— many of them delicate women. Then he yearned to cast off the garb of a pilgrim, and, laying aside the staff, to grasp the sword and perform deeds of more exalted usefulness. While pleading with his devoted escort for the gratification of his manly ambition he reached a House of the Templars. Three years of his Preparation had passed, and the ze~ilous Knight implored his escort to crave the permission of the Prior to devote the four remaining years to deeds of more exalted usefulness. The escort was moved by his entreaties, vouched for him to the Prior that he had performed full three years of Prep - aration, made his burning desires known, and cordially recommended him to official favor. The avouchment of his escort secured the favorable consideration of the Prior, who, after putting him under vows, granted him permission to take up sword and buckler, and go forth under escort of a Templar warrior, manfully wielding his sword in the defense of innocent maidens, destitute widows, helpless orphans and the Christian religion. And such a warfare was indeed a trial of his constancy and courage. As a warrior this gallant Knight pressed forward with fortitude undaunted, giving ample proof to his warrior escort that he was worthy to draw the sword in the cause to which he had consecrated it. But his deeds of valor soon created in him an ardent desire to be admitted to where honors and rewards await the results of valor and chivalry. He met armed Templars gallantly defending the dangerous passes of his route) and he yearned to be admitted to their ranks."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 TEMPLAR MONITOR. Three years more passed in this vigorous warfare, and at the close of the third year he reached another House of the Templars. Then he besought his warrior guide to implore the Prior to remit the remaining year of his Preparation. The warrior escort presented the petition to the Prior, vouched for the valor, courage and constancy of the peti - tioner, and that he had faithfully performed six of his seven years of Preparation, and even recommended that the re - mission asked for be granted, if it should so please the Prior. And though the Prior was moved by the recital of the deeds of valor wrought by the petitioner, and by the history of his courage and con~tancy, he could not shorten the time of Preparation laid on him at the beginning. Moreover, he feared that the memory of those acts of valor filled his heart with pride, and that self-confidence had sup - planted an humble reliance upon the strong arm of the Mas - ter. He therefore commanded the petitioner to devote the remaining year of Preparation to penitence, as a trial of his faith and humility. With the accomplishment of the penitential year the term of preparation ended, and the devoted neophyte was per - mitted to seal his faith and enlist under the banner of the Temple and of Emmanuel. At the death of De Molai the ancient Order of the Temple was suppressed and its members dispersed. The warlike spirit that ga&e it birth has passed away, but in this modern Order of the Temple there remains a spirit of refined and moral chivalry which should prompt all of its members to be ever ready to defend the weak, the innocent, the helpless and the oppressed; and in a brother’s cause to do all that may be demanded by manhood and fraternity."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 6g THE CHARGE.

Sir Knight, having passed through the several degrees of our ancient and honorable institution, we bid you a hearty welcome to all our rights and privileges, even to that disinterested friendship and unbounded hospitality which ever has, and we hope and trust ever will, continue to adorn, distinguish and characterize this noble Order. It will henceforth become your duty to assist, protect and defend the weary, wayworn traveler who finds the heights of fortune inaccessible, and the thorny paths of life broken, adverse and forlorn,—to succor, defend and protect the inno - cent, the distressed and the helpless, ever standing forth as a champion to espouse the cause of the christian Rehg-ion. You are to inculcate, enforce and practice virtue, and amid all the temptations which surround you, never to be drawn aside from the path of duty, or forgetful of those due guards and passwords, which are necessary to be had in perpetual remembrance; and while one hand is wielding the Sword for the defense of your Companion in danger, let the other grasp the mystic Trowel, and widely diffuse the gen - uine cement of Brotherly Love and rriendship. Sho.uld calumny assail the character of a Brother Sir Knight, recollect that you are to step forth and vindicate his good name, and assist him on all lawful occasions. Should assailants ever attempt your honor, interest or hap - piness, remember, also, that you have the counsel and sup - port of your brethren, whose mystic Swords, combining the virtues of raith, Hope and Charity, with Justice, Fortitude and Mercy, will leap from their scabbards in defense of your"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 TEMPLAR MONITOR. just rights, and insure you a glorious triumph over all yomr enemies. On this occasion permit me, Sir Knight, to remind yot’ of our mutual engagements, our reciprocal ties; for what - ever may be your situation or rank in life, you may find those in similar stations, who have dignified themselves and been useful to mankind. You are, therefore, called upon to discharge all your duties with fidelity and patience, whether in the Field, in the Senate, on the Ilencli, at the Bar, or at the Holy Altar. Whether you are placed upon the highest pinnacle of worldly grandeur, or glide into the humble vale of obscurity, unnoticed, save by a few, it matters not; for a few rolling suns will close thc sccne, wheii naiiglil but holi - ness will serve as a sure passport to gain admission into that REsT prepared from the foundation of the world. If you see a Brother bending under the cross of adversity and disappointment, look not idly on, neither pass by on the other side, but fly to his relief. If he be deceived, tell him the Truth; if he be calumniated, vindicate his cause; for, although he may have erred, still recollect that indis - cretion in him should never destroy humanity in you. Finally, Sir Knight, as memento mon is deeply engraved on all sublunary enjoyments, let us ever be found in the habiliments of righteousness, traversing the straight path of rectitude, virtue and true holiness; so that, having dis - charged our duty here below, pefformed the pilgrimage of life, burst the bands of mortality, passed over the Jordan of death and safely landed on the broad shore of eternity, there, in the presence of myriads of attending angels, we may be greeted as brethren, received into the arms of the BLESSED EMMANUEL, and forever made to participate in his HEAV - ENLY KINGDOM."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"TEiJIPLAR MONITOR. 7’ TO CLOSE TIlE COMMANDERY.

The territory assigned to Benjamin was about twenty-six miles long and twelve miles wide. It extended from the Jordan to seven miles west of JerusaThm. These were the oldest and the youngest sons of Jacoh, and they fell heir to Jerusalem, the Temple, and. the glories of the Mosaic tradi - tions, on the se&ession of the Ten Tribes under Rehoboam. Judab means ‘~the praise of the Lord;” Benjamin means “the son of the right hand.” I"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 TEMPLAR MONITOR. “And they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being inter - preted is, God with us.” Matt. i: 23. “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” Isaiah vii: 14. Emmanuel is the Greek form of the Hebrew Immanuel. Ahaz is informed of the birth of Messiah by Isaiah, and Matthew says this prophecy was accomplished in the birth of Christ. It was in its Greek form that the word was familiar to the Tern - plars of old, as well as of to-day. “And thou shalt call his name Jesus: for lie shall save his people from their sins.” Matt. i: 21. Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew Joshua, or Jeshna, which is a contraction of Jehoshua, (Numbers xiii: 16.) Its literal meaning is “he of Jehovah,” and we define it as “Saviour.” Jesus Christ means “Anointed Saviour.” As such is he adored by the Temphar. “And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull.” Matt. xxvii: 33. Golgotha literally means “a heap of skulls,” but three of the Evangelists define it as “a place of a skull.” Luke says, “which i3 called Calvary,” that is, “a skull.” The Greek word is ~ which the Vulgate renders Calvariam, meaning “a bare skull.” It is probable the name was given this elevation because of its pecul - iarly shaped summit. The awful tragedy enacted on Golgotha is dear to the true Tern - plar, and he ever holds his sword in readiness to defend the religion founded upon that tragedy. “Moreover the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning Maher-shahal-hash-baz.” Isaiah viii: i. An attempt at literal rendering of this passage would result in, “Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning Make speed to the spoil, hasten the prey.” The phrase is as difficult of translation as is the phrase, “Anathema Maran-atha.” It means in its naked form, “Hasten-booty, Speed-spoil.” It is pronounced Md-her sh~i1d1 h~sh’bdz. This phrase was cherished by the ancient Templars, who held it to be symbol~al of that readiness for action which should character - ize a true Soldier of Christ!"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THAIPLAI?

This Tat na-i was Satrap of the province west of the Euphrates, next to Judea. Shethar-boz na-i was not a Satrap, but an officer of rank, and though his name meant “star of splendor,” he united with Tatnai in an effort to shroud with gloom the hopes of the returned children of the captivity. God caused their wrath to praise him. THE SO-CALLED VISION OF CONSTANTINE. A fable invented by the sycophants of Constantine has been dig - nffied into a Motto of the valiant and inRg11~nimous Order of thc Temple, after passing through various gradations of fortune. The fable is thus related: Constantine the Great was declared Augustus and Pontifex Maxi - mus after he had vanquished the army of Marentius, under the walls of Rome. He professed Christianity. It was during his march on Rome, and while encamped near Mentz, that he was reported to have seen in the sky a fiery Cross, bearing the inscription ‘Es’ ~owz-c~, a, “With this sign you will conquer.” He had this symbol, known as the Cross of Constantine, emblazoned on the Imperial Standard, called the La6arum. how the Chi Rho Cross came to be changed into the Passion Cross of the Latin Church, and the Greek inscription into corre - sponding Latin, is clearly explained by the conquest of the Eastern by the Western Church. When the Church of Rome became mis - tress of the world everything had to submit to its dictation, and all popular myths gravitated to its use and emolument. It is deeply to be regretted that the name of Constantine, who murdered his father-in-law, his brother-in-law, his nephew, his son, and finally his wife, Fausta, should be associated with this popular myth, and this beautiful symbol. That lie was ever converted to Christianity we deny, and his being baptized only in the year in which he died, nearly a quarter of a century after his professed con - version, proves his deception. It is not established that the ancient Templars used either the Greek or the Latin inscription so popular with the modern Templars."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 TEMPLAR MONITOR. They did use the Passion Cross on the Beauceant, and as a part of their arniorial bearings. AN HISTORICAL FACT. Simon of Syracuse, a Temphar, betrayed his trust to the Saracens. Saladin, despising this Templar’s treason, had his head struck off and sent it to the Grand Master of the Temphars, who ordered it placed on the top of the longest spear iii camp, as a warning to all traitors. The Canadians relate that the head was “placed on a pole, or spire.” The Scotch say, “on the point of a spear or pike.” The head of one so despicable, if to be elevated at all, should be “placed upon the highest spire of Christendom,” as a warning to all traitors. DRESS OF THE ANCIENT TEMPLAJIS. The ancient Templars habitually wore a long, white Tunic, or Cas - sock, cut like that of the priests, with a red Cross before and behind. The Girdle was worn over the Shirt and under the Tunic. The serv - ing brethren wore dark Kirthes to distinguish them from the Knights, all being clad in whitc.~ The white Mantle, with its red Cross on the left breast, and a Hood, was worn over all. The material was always light, because of the great heat of Palestine. In 1162 the Pope permitted the Templars to receive into their houses spiritual persons, not bound by any previous vow. After one year’s novitiate these were initiated, as were the hay Knights. The habit of the Chaplain was a white Tunic and red Cros5: but none under a Bishop could wear a white Mantle. The Chaplain wore the baret, or Cap. There is a dispute as to the form of the Red Cross of the Order. We favor the form given elsewhere, on the Vexillum Ilelli, as the one used by the ancient Temphars, though some say the Cross on the left breast of the white Mantle was of “four arms, the under one being the longest.” The arms of a Knight Temphar were a Sword, Lance, Mace and Shield, and his head was covered by the Hood attached to his Mantle. He was allowed three horses and an esquire, who was a serving brother; or a hireling, who was a layman."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 75 THE ANCIENT MOTTO. The Grand Encampment has adopted this reading of the Motto of the ancient Templars: “Non nobis Dornine; non nobis, sed Nomin i /uo da gloriam.” In the “Biblia Sacra,” published in Antwerp in 1605, we find this reading of it: “Non nobis Domine, non nobis: sed Nomini /uo da gloriarn.” These words are found in the “Biblia Sacra” as part of Psalm cxiii, verse 31. In the Accepted Version they form part of Psalm cxv: i. It is probable that the omission of the comma after the sec - ond nobis, page 79, St. Louis Ritual, was a typographical blunder. As that Ritual no longer exists, the official reading adopted for the Grand Standard remains in force. “IT IS FINISHED.” In its Latin form,—” Consummalum es/,”—this was a cherished phrase of the ancient Templar usage. It is to be regretted that its use appears to be entirely dropped by the Modem Order in the United States. Would it not be a proper complement of the phrase, “Zn hoc Signo 1/inces,” and. on reversing the position to use “Consummaluin est”?"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"APPENDIX.

No Knight Templar can be buried with the funeral honors of Knighthood, unless he be in regular standing. 2. It is the duty of the Eminent Commander to convene the Coin - inandery, upon notice of the death of a Sir Knight who may be enti - tIed to receive funeral honors, upon request, made when living or by his family after his decease, for the purpose of attending the funeral ceremonies. 3. The Knights, on such occasions, will attend in full uniform, pursuant to the regulations; their sword hilts and the Banner of the Commandery suitably dressed in mourning. 4. On the coffin of the deceased will be placed his hat and sword; and if an Officer, his jewel, trimmed with crape. 5.

The Knights will assemble at their Asylum, and march to the residence of the deceased, in the usual order of processions, swords at Carry; the line being headed by the Warder, and the Officers being in the rear, according to rank; that is, the Eminent Commander last.

Mortality has been brought to view, that we might more earnestly seek an immortality beyond this fleeting life, where death comes no more forever. The sad and mournful knell has betokened that another spirit has winged its flight to a new existence. An alarm has come to the door of our Asylum, and the messenger was Death. None presumed to say to the awful presence: “Who dares approach?” A pil - grim warrior has been summoned, “and there is no discharge in that war.” A burning taper of life in our Commandery has been extinguished, and none save the High and Holy One can re-light it. All that remains of our beloved com - panion lies mute before us, and the light of the eye, and the breathing of the lips, in fraternal greeting, has ceased to us forever on this side of the grave.

Over these errors, whatever they may have been, we cast, while living, the mantle of charity; it should, with much more reason, enshroud him in death. We who have been taught to extend the point of charity even to a foe when fallen, can not be severe or merciless toward a loved brother. The memory of his virtues lingers in our remembrance and reflects its shining lustre beyond the portals of the tomb.

To succor and protect the sorrowing and destitute, the innocent and oppressed, was their vow and their life-long labor and duty. For long, long years they well and nobly performed their vows and did their devoirs. In those rude ages the steel blade was oftener the arbiter of justice than the judgments of judicial tribunals or the decrees of magistrates. So long as the Templars adhered to their vows of poverty they were virtuous and innocent, and their language was in truth, “Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee.” But, with the accession of wealth and civil power, they were tempted, and fell from their high estate, and their possessions attracted the cupidity and their prowess incurred the hatred of the despots of those times. When the martyred De Molai had perished and the Order was proscribed, they united with the fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, and returned to their primitive simplicity of manners; and a rough habit, coarse diet and severe duty was all that was offered to their votaries. 9"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"130 TEMPL Al?

The Christian Era was first used by a Roman abbot, Denys le Petit, or Dionisius Exigus, about the year 527. It was generally adopted in England in the eighth century. The Council of Chelsea, July, 8i6, ordained that all bishops should date their acts from the year of the incarnation of our Saviour. In the Eastern Empire it was not in general use until after the capture of Constantinople by Mahomet II, in 1453. Down to 1752 the Historical year in England commenced on Jan - uary ist, and the Ecclesiastical, Civil (Legal) year commenced on March 25th. This led to great confusion, to avoid which it was long the custom to add the date of the Historical to that of the Legal year, when speaking of any day between January 1st and March 25th, thus: 8 J i. e., 1648, the Civil (Legal) year.

Should the accused admit the charges when served upon him, proof of such admission or confession will be all that the Committee is required to have made, and they will make up their minutes and report accordingly.

Before proceeding to vote the accused should retire. The Commandery then proceeds to consider the matter in the following manner: FIXING PUNISHMENT. “Are the charges sustained?” is the first question, and if decided in the affirmative, the Commandery then proceeds, by vote, to fix the punishment. This is done by putting the question: 1st. “Shall the accused be expelled?” If this is (lecided in the negative; 2d. “Shall the accused be indefinitely suspended?” If this is de - cided in the negative; 3d. “Shall the accused be (lefinitely suspended?” If this is de - cided in the affirmative, then, on niotion, the time should be fixed by vote; but if decided in the negative;"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. i61 4th. “Shall the accused be reprimanded?” Which, of course, the other questions having been negatived, will be decided in the affirma - tive, the charges having been sustained, and this being the lightest punishment which can be inflicted.

Give unremitting attention to the protection of the Ritual, and the Paraphernalia of your Commanderies, The first should never be out of your care, the other should be kept in peffect repair. 2. Be certain that the Sentinel, or Janitor, has everything in read - iness for the Conclaves of the Commanderies. The comfort of your Fratres should be an unremitting solicitude. Their attendance will be largely affected by your attention to this hint. 3. See to it that your Fratres are piovided with nuiforms, but in doing so be not forgetful of the tenderness of many on matters that affect their purses.~ Persuade, but do not command. Some Grand Commanderies have a rule on this matter of uniforming. Enforce it in love. 4. Do not begin the Opening Ceremonies until you are certain that the Asylum is in proper array, and all necessary arrangements are made. 5. Permit no admissions during the Opening Ceremonies. Allow no conversation, not even whispering, while opening. Such inter - ruptions seriously affect the solemnities. 6. Never begin the Work until you are certain that everything is ready, in place, and in order. Halts to make search for missing para - phernalia are destructive to good Work. 7. Permit no moving about the Asylum, conversation, or com - ments during the Work. This is of vital importance. Fratres who think they can not refrain from these disturbances should quietly withdraw to the Reception Room, or some other outer apartment. Be certain to make your request for absolute silence before you begin Work. 8. Do not permit military drill during the Work. Form the Escort by arrangements made by the Captain General before the Work begins. Let the chosen Knights so sit that at the low-given command—” Fall in “—they may quietly step to their places, with Swords at a Carry. The formation by counting and facing breaks up all solemnity.

RULES OF ORDER. The following simple rules will be about all that Commanders will find necessary in conducting the business of the Conclaves: i. On the demand of a member, a motion must be reduced to writing. 2. A motion, when stated by the Commander, can not be with - drawn without the consent of the Commandery. 3. A motion to postpone to an indefinite time is debatable; a motion to postpone to a time definite is not debatable. 4. No amendment beyond an amendment to an amendment can be enteriained. 5. A question will be divided on request of a member. 6. A proposition to be referred to a committee wi/h instructions is debatable; if without instructions, it is not debatable. 7 A Frater voting in the majority may move to reconsider; such a motion is not debatable. 8. When a proposition is reconsidered it is before the Commandery in the exact form it was in at the moment it was voted upon. 9. Before a member is required to vote upon a paper he may re - quire its reading. 10. When the report of a Committee is read, or received, it is the property of the Commandery, and the Committee is discharged with - out a vote. It may be revived."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 173 i i. When the Commander desires the debate to cease he arises, and proceeds to take the necessary steps. 12.

A floral crown, and a floral cross should be prepared, and placed convenient to the proper officers. A floral wreath should be wound around a sword, and placed near the chair of the captain General. The Officers should be in full Templar costume, and the Prelate in regulation robes. If possible, all the knights should be in full Templar costume. The music should be effectively rendered, and should be solemn and pathetic. The ceremonials should be conducted in a slow and measured manner, solemnity and tenderness being the chief characteristics. The officers enter in procession, and when they have taken their stations the ceremonies will begin. THE CEREMONIES. Choir sings “Rock of Ages,” or other appropriate music: COMMANDER.—Sir Knights, a Pilgrim Warrior, a soldier of the Cross, a Companion beloved, has been summoned hence. He has obeyed the summons and laid aside his armor. There is a vacancy in the Grand Commandery of a vacant chair in our council chamber. A taper has been extinguished here, to be relighted up yonder. When the Commander says, “extinguished here,” he will pause, and extinguish the taper at the apex of his triangular table. When he says, “to be relighted up yonder,” he will relight the taper. Beloved, we have gathered together to honor the memory of a Companion in arms, Sir Knight ; to tender condolence to the bereaved, and to crave permission to min - gle our tears with theirs.

In the midst of life we are in death; but unto whom shall we go for succor but unto Him who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. Excellent Prelate, read unto us from the Father’s will. FIRST LESSON. Prelate reads Jo6 XjV.~ I, 2,5—14; i Corinthians xv: 12—23. P.—Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; lie fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he can not pass, turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. For there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again, and that the tender branches thereof will not cease. Though the root wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground, yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not; till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep. If a man die shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee. But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen. And if Christ be not risen, then is your preach - ing vain, and your faith is also vain. * * * For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised; and if Christ is not"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 187 raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. * * * If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his order; Christ the first fruits, afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming. Brethren, let us pray. PRAYERS. ALMIGHTY and mn~t M~rcifit1 Wnther, who has com - mended us to love one another as thy children, send down upon us at this time the dew of thy heavenly grace; pardon all our transgressions; renew within us right spirits, and refresh us with the sweetness of thy love; give unto us faith and hope so that this, our sorrow, may conduce to our eternal happiness. Look with compassion upon these bereaved ones, and pour into their bleeding hearts the con - solations of thy grace; and may they have part and lot with all thy saints, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. AMEN. COMMAND thy blessing, 0 God, to abide with all who are sick or afflicted; with the widow and the orphan; with the dying and the convalescent; with the poor and the dis - tressed. Bestow upon all the spirit of thy grace, and help us to bear each other’s burdens, so that having lived together in love here, we may, through the merits of our once cruci - fied, but now risen and exalted Redeemer, ascend unto that peace that remaineth to the people of God, and forever unite in singing the praises of redeeming love.

While the last verse is being sung the Commander will toll the Bell, and the hail lights will be slowly lowered, until a dim light pervades. THE CEREMONIES. The Captain General will arise with the wreathed sword in hand. CG.—In the hands of our deceased Companion this sword was endowed with three inestimable qualities—Justice, Fortitude and Mercy. Whenever he grasped this glittering sword, his hand first laid hold upon the cross, (holding cross of sword upwards), and before he drew it from its scabbard he was well assured of the JUSTICE of his cause."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. 189 I lay his Sword, wreathed with emblems of our affection, on this Triangle dedicated to JUSTICE. The Captain General remains standing, and after a pause the Generalissimo rises. G. ( Withfloral Cross in hand)—Our Companion delighted to wear upon his breast this emblem of the Christian Faith. He could exclaim with the apostle, “God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ.” May this (raising the Cross) be the token to admit him where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. To the memory of his Christ ian fidelity, courage and constancy, I lay this emblem on the Triangle dedicated to FORTITUDE. The Generalissimo remains standing. A pause, then the Com - mander rises. C. (With floral Crown in hand)—” Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life.” Because our Companion was faithful do we hope that a crown awaited him in that “house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” This emblem of that hope, (raising floral Crown) I now deposit on the Triangle dedicated to MERCY. Excellent Prelate, lead our Devotions. P.—Beloved, let us kneel in prayer. The Choir will sing in scft, low voices: i. Just as I am, without one plea, But that thy blood was shed for me, And that thou bidst me come to thee, 0 Lamb of God I come."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"190 TEMPLAR MONITOR. 2.

HEAVENLY Father, in whose holy sight centuries ~re but as days, look down upon these bowed, weary pilgrims who are traveling through this vale of tears, and soften their afflictions with the consolations of thy Holy Spirit, the Comforter.

AMEN. As the word Amen is pronounced the lights of the hall will be flashed up, and all will be seated. THE CHANT OF MOURNING. The Choir will then chant the following selection of Scripture: In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened. And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"TEMPLAR MONITOR. ‘9!

Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit return unto God who gave it. ADDRESS BY THE COMMAND ER. C.—Sir Knights, each bereavement severs a sordid cord that binds us to this lower life, and stretches a golden one from earth to heaven. These severings command a halt, send us into the solitude of reflection, and enquire if we are able to answer the necessary questions, and wash our hands in innocency, in token of our sincerity. Brethren, the memory of him who falls in a just cause is forever blessed. That just cause to us means defense of holy religion, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and binding up the wounds of the afflicted. It was in such a cause our Brother was engaged when he fell, and his memory shall forever flourish in immortal green. Though he now sleeps the long, undisturbed repose of death, his virtues are fresh, and live in our hearts. In the darkness of the tomb his ashes but await the summons of the resurrection, and his glorified spirit, we trust, is now engaged in hymning the praises of redeeming love. Let us, therefore, having hope in God, lay aside the drapery of our mourning, and ascending out of the darkness of our grief into the light of the promises of our Great Cap - tain, perform this last duty to the memory of our friend."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"192 TEMPLAR MONITOR.
