ITS COVERING is no less than a clouded canopy or starry.decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by aid of the theological ladder, which Jacob in his vision, saw extending from eaIth to heaven; the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope and Charity, and which admonish us I - ENTERED APPRENTICE. 43 tri hove faith in God, hope in immortality, and cli~lrity to all mankind. 1’lic gIeatest of these is Charity; for faith may be lost in sight; hope ends in fruition; hot charity extends beyond the grave through the boundless realms of eternity.

The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple. The Indented Tessel, <that beautiful tesselated border, or skirting, with which it was surrounded; and the Blazing Star in the Centre, the S S. or Holy of Holses. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematic of human life, checkered with good and evil, the beautiful border which surrounds it, those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a faithful reliance on divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the blazing star in the centre. THERE ARE THREE LIGHTS I I I in a Lodge, situated in the south, west and east.

ENTERED APPRENTiCE. ~l7 By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rode and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar that state of perfection at which we.hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle-board we are also reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his trestle- board, so should we, both operative and speculative, ~ndeanor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of nature and revelation, which is our spiritual, moral and Masonic trestle-board. SITUATION OF LODGES. Lodges are situated due east and west, 1~c~in~e King Solomon’s temple was so situated. King Solomon’s temple was so situated, because after Moses had safely conducted the ehildten of Israel through the Red Sea when pursued by Pharaoh and his host, he, by a divine command, erected a taber - nacle. This tabernacle was an exact model for King Solomon’s temple, and was situated due east and west to perpetuate a remembrance of that miraculous east wind by which their mighty deliver. ance was wrought; also to receive the rays of the rising sun. DEDICATION OF LODGES. Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Sol - omon, because be was our first Most Excellent Giand Master, but modern Masons dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time there is repre - sented, in every regular and well governed Lodge, a certain point within the circle, embor - dered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, assd upon the top rests the Holy Scriptures. (The point represents an in - dividual brother, the circle the boundary line beyond which he is never to suffer his prejudices .1 iN."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"48 MAsONrC MANUAL.

In going round this circle we necessarily touch upon these two lines as well as the Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within theis precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err. THE TENETS OF OUR ORDER ARE BROTHERLY LOVE, RELIEF AND TRUTH. BIiOTMRRLY LOVE. By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to regard the whole hu - man species as one f am - ily the high and low, the rich and poor, who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support and pro - tect each other. On this principle, Masoory unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance RELS RE. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on aU men, bat particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathizc with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish oui connections. is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson wc are ta~ight in Masonry.

This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess or contracting any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence of which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable se~ crets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would con~ sequentle subject him to the contempt and detes - tation of all gocd Masoos. * * * * FORTITUDE whereby we aie enabled to undergo i~.ny pain, peril or danger, when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice, and, like the former, should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every Mason as a safeguard or security against any illegal attack that may be made by force or otherwise, to extort from him any of _________ those valuable secIets with which he has been so solemnly intrusted, and which were emblematically represented upon his first admission into the Lodge. * ~ * * PRUDE NCR teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge, and pruden - tially determine, on all things relative to our present as well as to our future happi - ness. This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of cvery Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the v,orld. It should be particularly attended ~o, in all strange and mixed companies, novor to let fall the least sign, token or word whereby the secrets of Masonry might be unlaw - fully obtained.

JUSTICE is that standard or boundary of right which enables us to render to every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human laws, but it is the very cement and support of civil society; and as justice in a great measure constitutes the real good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate from the minutest principles thereof * CHALK, CHARCOAL AND CLAY.

The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been encauragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never mentioning His name l)ut with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all yoir laudable ‘undertakings, and to esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor in actiog upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you, and to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity aud intemperance which may impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your pro - fession. A zealous attachment to these duties will iasure public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet add pe acefu subject, true to your goveroment, and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and confoim with cheerfulness to the government of the country in ‘which you live. In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure and reproach. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry shall interfere with your neces - sary vocations; for these are on no account to be neglected, neither are Von to sofTer yriur zeal for the institution to lead you into argunici,t with those who, through ignorance, may ridicole i I. At your leisure hours, that you may iniprove in Masonic knowledge, you are ~o converse with well- informed brethren, who will always be as rcei ly to give as you will be to receive instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mys - teries of the Order, as these are to distinguish yriu from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly at - tentive not to recommend him unless you are con - vinced he will conform to our rules, that the honor, glory and reputation of the institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects.

By Opeiative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence wilt result a due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice, as in the arrangement~ of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demon - strates that a fund of science and industry is im - planted in man, for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. SPECULATIVE MASO ~‘4RY. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligation to pay~that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and oui happi - ness. It leads the contemplative to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exa4i~ iil(’riS of the perfections of his divine Creator. O~r ancient brethren wrought in operative as well £w speculative Masonry. We work in speculative only. They wrought six days, and rested upon the seventh, because in six days God created the heaven and earth, and rested upon the seventh day, the seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren conse - crated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of creation, and to adore their great Creator. * Ii. * * * I, * They were eighteen cubits high, twelve in cir - cumference, and were hollow, the better to serve as a F - “IrI~ThT’n"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"61 60 MASONIC MANUAL. safe repository for the archives of Masonry against inundations and conflagrations.

The bands which connected these trees at the top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of arch Ltecture. The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITEC - TURE The ancient and original Orders in Architecture revered by Masons are no more than three—the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two—the Tuscan and the Composite. To the Gteeks, therefore, and not to ~he Romans, are we indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in Architecture.

This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art.

HISTORICAL LECTURE. Sacred history ioforms US that it was deterinsned by infinite wisdom that a temple should be founded at the City of Jerusalem, to be erected to God and dedicated to HAs holy name. The high and distin - gusshed honor of performing thss sacred service was denied Davsd, King oE Israel, because he had been a man of blood. But he received a promise from the true and Living God that lie would raise up a seed to serve him, which dsvine and gracious promise was fulfilled in the person of Solomon, hss son, who suc - ceeded him in the kingdom. No sooner had this wise king ascended the throne of his father and be - gun to wield the scepter over Israel than he took measures to execute the high and holy task which had been imposed upon him, that of building a house to the Lord, his God. At this time the noise of war had ceased in all the land, and peace reigned throughout its borders. The children of Israel now looked forward with peculiar satisfaction for a dis - play of that wisdom which was to astonish the world. We are informed by the writings of Josephus, as well as the Holy Scriptures, that in the second month of the fourth year of King Solomon’s reign, and in the third year after the death of David, he began to btiild the Temple, and during its whole progress, which was about seven years and six months, Mas - S * * * * ~ * SECTION THIRD. p N K"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MASONIC MANUAL. 76 MASTER MASON. 77 onie tradition informs us that it. rained not, except in the night or at a time when the craft were at re - freshment, therehy evincing a miraculous interposi - tion of divine providence in that great and glorious work.

The most of us, my brethren, are fast approaching, or have already passed the meridian of life, our sun is sinking in the west, and 0 how much more swift is the passing of our declining years than whenwestarted upon the journey and believed, as the young are too apt to believe that the roseate hues of the rising sun of our existence were always to be continued. When we look back upon the happy days of our childhood, when the dawning intellect first began to exercise its powers of thought, it seems but as yesterday, and that, by a simple effort of the will, we could put aside our manhood, and seek again the loving caresses of a mother, or be happy in the possession of a bauble; and could we now realixe the idea that our last day had come, our whole earthly life would seem but as the space of time from yesterday until to-day. Centuries upon centuries have rolled away behind u \\ before us stretches out an eternity of yeats to c~rn 1 c; jnd upon the narrow boundary between the past and the pres - ent flickers the puny taper we term our hfe. When we came into the world we knew naught of what had been before us, but, as we grew up to manhood we learned of the past; we saw the flowers bloom as they had bloomed for centuries, we beheld the orbs of day and night pursuing their endless course among the stars, and as they pursued it from the birth of light we learned what men had thought and said and done, from the begining of the world to our day; but only through the eye of faith can we behold what is to come hereafter, and only through a firm reliance up- on the Divine prom Lses can we satisfy the yearnings of an immortal soul. The cradle speaks to us of re - membrance, the coffin of hope, of a blessed trust in a glotions immortality, and a never ending existence beyond the gloomy portals of the tomb!

Our step is time; our progression, eternity. Following our ancient Constitutions, with mystic rites we dedicate this hall to the honor of Freemason - ry Our best attachments are due to the Craft. In its prosperity, we find our joy, and, in paying it honor, we honor ouiselves. But its worth trans - cends our eneomiums, and its glory will outsound our praise. Brethren: It is our pride that we have our names on the record of Freemasonry. May it be our high ambition that they should shed a lustre on the im - mortal page! The hall is also dedicated to Virtue. This worthy appropriation will always be duly regarded, while the moral duties which our sublime lectures inculcate, \\vith effective and impressive pertinency, are cherished in our hearts and illus - trated in oui lives. As Freemasonry aims to enhven the spirit of Philanthropy and piomote the cause of Chasity, so we dedicate this hall to Universal Benevolence; in the assurance that every brother will dedicate his affections and his abilities to the same generous pur - pose; that while he displays a warm and cordial affection to those who are of the Fiaternity, he will extend his benevolent regards and good wishes to the whole family of mankind. Such, my brethren, is the significant meaning of the solemn rites we have just performed, because such are the peculiar duties of every Lodge. I need not enlarge upon them now, nor show how they diverge, as rays fiom the centre, to enlighten, to improve, and to cheer the whole circle of life, Their import and their application is familiar to you all.

While in almost every other association of men, political animosities, con - tentions and wars, interrupt the progress of human - ity and the cause of benevolence, it is our dis - tinguished privilege to dwell together in peace, and engage in plans to perfect individual and social hap - piness. While in many other nations our Order is viewed by politicians with suspicion, and by the ignorant with apprehension, in this county its mem - bers are too much respected and its principles too well known, to make it the object of jealousy or mis - trust.

(who are called up by three raps): You have been formed under a dispensation into a Lodge of Ancient Free and Ac - cepted Masons, and are empowered to confer the several degrees of Ancient Craft Masonry, and to transact the necessary business incident thereto. Your authority is strictly limited by the law of the Grand Lodge, AXF. &A. M. of Alabama, and your continuance as a Lodge under dispensation is sub - 3ect to the will and pleasure of the Grand Master, who may at any time revoke Ihe authority under which you are now working. It is your duty, as officers and members, to strictly obel the law, and in order to do so you should care - fully study all of its ptovisions, as any departure therefrom may subject you to censure, and might icsult in the recalling of your dispensation. Lodges are first instituted under dispensation as test of the ability of the officers and brethren to properly perform the duties incumbent upon them, and if, after due trial, they are found worthy and wull qualified, they are constitu ted and formed into ii.gular Lodges, with full power to work under charter.

The Grand Lodge has its own esoteric or secret work, and has a Grand Lecturer and District Lecturers to teach it, and Lodges are required to conform strictly thereto. The Manual adopted by the Grand Lodge must be used, and no other. The desire on the part of Lodges under dispensation to confer degrees upon applicants too often results in the admission into our Fraternity oE some who are not worthy and well~ qualified. Bear in mind that the stability of Lodge depends upon the quality of its members, and’ not upon the number upon whom its favors are bestowed. As the strength of a chain is tested by its weakest [ink, so the standing of a Masonic Lodge is measured by its weakest member. I especially admonish you to inquire carefully into the character and standing of those who seek admission into our Fraternity. No man can add to or shed lustre upon Freemasonry; no one should be solicited to become one of us. We confer favors upon those whom we accept, and we should know beyond question that the recipients are worthy of what we have to impart I charge you to guard well the portals of this Lolgo, as we have a right to know that every Free - mason you create is entitled to be greeted by the Fraternity as a friend and brother wheresoever dis - porscd throughout the globe PROCLAMATION.

The Lodge being called up, the Installing Officer continues as follows. TO THE BRETHREN OF THE LODGE. Brethren of — Lodge, such is the nature of our Constitution that some must of neces - sity rule and teach; others must submit and obey. The officers you have chosen, and who have been regularly installed, are sufflcsently acquaipted with the rules of propriety and the laws of th~ institution to avoid exceedsng the powers wsth which they are intrusted. The harmony of the Lodge wsll mater - ially depend upon the good order you may preserve in the conduct of its business and the courtesy and forbearance you may observe toward each dther in its delsberation s. I charge you, then, as you shall answei~ at the last clay, that you act worthy of the vocation to which you are called, and suffer no faults, no sin - pcifcctions on your part, to tarnish the lustre of your jewels or bring discredit upon the Craft. Recoin - l(ifld Masonry to the world by the rectitude of your conduct, To this end make yoursclvcs intimately acquainted with all its principles and obligations, and practice in your lives all its duties and require - ments. Divest yourselves, brethren, of coldness and apathy, so fatal to your best interests. Shun those aflections and groveling .passsons unworthy of a soul that claims affinity with the ilSons of Light’~ and put forth all your energies to grasp whatever ss noble or elevating in thought, and whatever can reveal new and sublime ideas pertaining to our lofty destiny. Guard against dissenssons among your - selves Let no root of bitterness spring up to trouble you. Use all your exertions to preserve your Lodge pure, and prevent the introduction of vice or error in its thousand forms. If in the frailty of mor - tality, a brother falls under the snfluence of unholy feelings and wanders into forbidden paths, seek the wanderer out, brsng him hack to the fold, and show hsm the supersor loveliness of virtue. Much may be accomplished by the force of good e~.ample and by offering good counsel in a friendly spirit, ever remem - bering that to err is human, to forgive divine Finally, brethren, he of one mind, live in peace Let nothing disturb that pure, warm and holy love which our ritual enjoins. Follow these injunctions and your Lodge will flourish. May the tenets of your profession be transmitted through your Lodge unimpaired from generation to generation. MUSICAL SELECTION.

OF THE OLD CHARGES OF FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS, COLLECTED FROM RECORDS AS PUBLISHED BY THE GRAND LODGE OF ENGLAND, 1722. I. CONCERNING GOD AND RELIGION. A Mason is ohliged by his tenure to obey the moral law, and if we rightly understand the Art he will never be a slupid atheist nor an ~rreligious libertine. But though in ancient times Mas - ons were charged in every country to be of the religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, yet it is now thought more expedient only to oblige thsm to that religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves—that is, to be feed men and lrue, or men of honor and honesty, by whatever denominations or persuasions they may be distin - guished, whereby Masonry becomes the cenlre of union, and the means of conciliating true friendship among persons that must have remained at a perpetual distance H OF THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE, SUPREME AND SUBORDINATE A Mason is a peaceable subioct to the civil powers wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in plots and conspiracies against the peace and ivelfare of the nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior magistrates, for as Masonry hath been always iniured by war, bloodshed and con - fusion, so ancient kings and princes have been much disposed to encourage the Cralt~nsen, becaute of their peaceabieiiess and loyally, whereby they practically answer the revile of their adversaries, and promoted the honor of the Fraternity, who ever flourished in times of peace, so that if a brother should be a rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanced in his"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"204 MASONIC MANUAL rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man, and i 1 convicted ol no. other crime,- though ‘the loyal biotheihOOd must and ought to disown his rebellion, and give no umbrage or ground of political 1 ealousy to the government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his relation to it remains sudefeasible.

OF MASTERS, WARDENS, FELLOWS AND AP - PRENTIG~S.

It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every brother must attend in his place, and learn them in a way peculiar to his Fraternity Only candidates may know that un Master should take an Apprentice unless he have suf - ficient employment for him, and unless he be a perfect youth, having no maim or defect in his body that may render him in - tapable of learning the Art, of serving his Master’s Loid, and of being nsade a breiher, and then a Fellow Craft in due time, even after he has served such a term of years as the custom of ANCIENT LAND MARKS. 205 the country directs, and that he should be descended of honest nicnts, that so, when otherwise qualified, he may arrive to the lissnor of heing the Warden, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Mastei of all the Lodges, according to his merit No brother can be a Warden until he has passed the past of a Fellow Graft, nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand Warden until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor Grand Master unless he he has been a Fellow Graft befoie his election, who is also to be nobly born, or a gentleman of the best fashion, or some cuneus architect, or other artist, descended of honest parents, and who is of singular great merit in the opinion of the Lodges Aiffi f or the better and easier and more honorable discharge of his office, the Grand Master has a power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular Lodge. and has the privilege ol acting whatever the Grand Mastei. his principal, should act, unless the said principal be present, or interpose his authority by a letter These rulers ariA governors, supreme and subordinate, of the ancient Lodge, are to be obeyed in their respective stations by all the brethren, acrord~ng to the old charges and reetilations, svith all humility, reverence, love and alacrity v Or TIdE MANAGEMENT OF TIlE GRAFT IN WORK - ING All Masons shall s’eik honestly on working days, that they may live creditably on holy days, and the time apposuted hy the law of the land or confirmed by custom, shall be observed.
