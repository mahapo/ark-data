THE Volume now presented to the Masonic 1 .ublio assumes to itself no special originality; but the appa - rent want of a complete and systematic hand-book for the assistance and instruction of those essaying the higher walks of Masonry, in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, would seem to justify the humble ambi - tion which the Collator of this volume has attempted. His personal experience, extending through a period of years, has taught him the necessity of some complete Monitor whereby the beauty and sublimity of the Rite could be more thoroughly and justly rendered. Deferring, as he does, with all respect to those who have preceded him in similar efforts, he humbly trusts that if he has not added anything of value, interest, or importance to the beautiful ritual of the Rite, that he may not be accused of detracting from any portion of that solemnity and solid worth which necessarily form the basis of its several Degrees.

The Collator, in presenting the result of his labors to the public, by no means would claim an approach to perfection; it will doubtless be conceded that in this country, so far as the various degrees have been fully worked, that while replete with beauty, moral and in - structive teachings, their rendering is still susceptible of elaboration and improvement. The effort of the Collator has been, in this work, to maintain all the original landmarks of the Rite in their pristine purity, and at the same time to embellish, so far as might be proper, with kindred surroundings, many portions of the work where the original ritual might seem defective. In performing the self-imposed and pleasing task, which is thus completed, it would be improper to forget the aid that has been attained from the writings of the Illustrious Past Grand Commanders of the Northern Jurisdiction of the United States, and in such portions of this work where the Rituals and Monitors of the Northern and Southern Supreme Councils are the same, all credit is due to the present Grand Commander of the Southern Supreme Council, ALBERT PIKE; and it must appear to the Student, that the Sacred writings have been necessarily drawn upon in this connection, as also the Al-Koran, Talmud, Josephus, Herodotus, the Persian Ma~i and contemporaneous writings, as also Findel, Addison, and others."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CLASSIFICATION OF THE DEGREES OF THE ANCIENT AND ACCEPTE[) SCOTTISH RITE.

THE following pages are not intended to give a full and elaborate history of the Ancient and Accepted Scot. tish Rite; space cannot be spared in a work intended only as a monitor or handbook for the guidance and instruction of those having an interest in the Rite ;—yet it is deemed proper and expedient to insert a brief his - tory for the information of those who might not havd the opportunity of searching and examining a subject claiming so much interest. The antiquity of Freemasonry and its ancient history are evidently involved in fable, and the few authentic historians whose works are extant, have thrown but little light upon the subject. The opinions of those who have written on Freemasonry have differed with regard to its origin as an organized institution.

Although in a detached form, doubtless some of the degrees had their origin as early as the fourteenth cen - fury; yet the Rite, as such, germinated in the latter part (if the seventeenth century, and took its distinctive char - acter in the beginning of the eighteenth century. The late Giles Fonda Yates, a member of the British Archaeological Association, Grand Commander of the Northern Supreme Council of the United States, gave as the result of his research the following: “The proofs are undeniable that the learning con - tained in the “Sublime Degrees,” was taught long pre - vious to the last century—our M..

Many Scotch brethren (adherents of the Pretender, James Stuart) being in France about this time, also cul - tivated some of the high degrees of our rite.” The opponents of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, such as Findel, and others, assert that the Rite took its origin about the year 1 ‘740, from Michael Andrew Ram- say, a native of Scotland, generally known as the “Chevalier Ramsay,” who was born at Ayr in 1686, and died in St. Germain-en-laye, in France, in 1 ‘743; that from the time of the banishment of the Stuarts from England in 1688, secret alliances had been kept up be - tween Rome and Scotland, the Pretender Stuart having retired iii 1 ‘719 to Rome; that as these communications became more intimate, the hopes of the Pretender iii- creased; that Ramsay attempted to corrupt the loy - alty and fealty of Freemasonry in the Grand Lodge of Scotland, founded in P736, and being unable so to do, conceived the scheme of assembling and more fully band - ing together, the faithful adherents of the banished royal family in the higher grades, and thus filling their private coffers; that the Masonic Lodges of France were composed of Scotch conspirators and accomplices of the Jesuits, who had sunk so low they were ready to seize on the abundance of display and effect which were presented; not knowing that the “Masonic titles"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 HISTORY. in our ‘Inner East,’ like the jewels on our breasts, arc not cherished and worn by us for show or aggrandize - ment, but that they are ~uggestivc of holy truths and self-perfecting duties.” Tiio~y, in tho Acta Latamorum, says that “Robert Bruce, King of Sectiarid, under the title of Robert I., created the order of St. Andrew of Chardon, after the battle of Bannockburn, which was fought June 24th, 1314. To this order was afterward united that of here - don, for the sake of the Scotch Masons, who formed a part of the thirty thousand troops with whom he had fought an army of one hundred thousand Englishmen. King Robert reserved the title of Grand Master to him - self and his successors forever, and founded the Royal Grand Lodge of Heredom at Kilwinning.” Dr. Oliver says “this Royal Order afterward confined itself solely to the two degrees of Heredom and Rosy- cross.” The following is perhaps the more reliable and prob - able history of the origin of the degrees of the Ancient Ao~epted Scottish Rite. At or about the period of the Masonic revival and excitement in the early part of the 18th century, there was felt a desire for a deeper re - search into the arcana of Frecmasonry, and a thorough examination of the esoteric doctrines of the Order.

With this purpose in view, attempts were made to establish separate and distinct organizations, wherein these sublime truths might be revealed and cultivated. Nearly all these projects were ephemeral, and were outlived by their projectors, while the “Rite of Perfec - tion,” the germ of the organization of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite—based upon the pure principles of Masonry, and the elucidation of the occult mysterics, containing twenty-five degrees—gradually approached development. Doubtless the ~course of the Chevalier Ramsay, in 1 ‘140, hastened the consummation of the systematizing and embodying the degrees which had theretofore been for many years detached and unlocated. Some authorities assert that this Rite of PerfQction as an organization was founded in 1’753, while others insist that in 1’Z58 certain Masons, styling themselves “Sover - eign Princes and Grand Officers of the Grand and Sover - eign Lodge of St. John of Jerusalem,” founded at Paris a body called “The Council of Emperors of the East and West.” This Council has bcen ordinarily kriowii as the Rite of Perfection, and according to Thory, Ragon, Levequc, Vidal, Feraiidie, Clavel, and others, consisted of twenty-five degrees: in 1 ‘759 it established a Coun - cil of Princcs of’ the Royal Sccret at Bordeaux, and from this period began to extend itself.

When Inspector-General Morin arrivcd in America, in accordance with the powers vested by his patent, he appointed Moses Michael Hays a Deputy Inspector General, with the authority to appoint others. Deputy Inspector Hays appointed Isaac iDa Costa Deputy Inspector-General for the State of South Caro - lina. After the death of Deputy Inspector-General iDa Costa, Joseph Myers was appointed his successor. On the 25th October, 1762, the Grand Masonic Con - stitutions were finally ratified in Berlin, Prussia, and proclaimed throughout the world for the government of all Lodges, Councils, Chapters, Colleges, and Cousis - tories of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite over the surface of the two hemispheres.

No Supreme Councils of Sovereign Grand Inspect ors - General were established anywhere in the world till after this date; previously, Deputy Inspectors-General were charged with the powers and duties now vested in such Supreme Councils and the grand bodies under them. In the new constitution this high power was conferred on a Supreme Council of nine brethren in each nation, who possessed all the Masonic prerogatives in their own district, while two Supreme Councils were provided for in the United States of America with equal powers in their respective jurisdictions. The first Supreme Council ever established under the new constitution of 1’786, was that at Charleston, whose jurisdiction extended, constitutionally, over the whole of the United States, until they constituted the North - ern Supreme Council. Then the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions were geographically defined. On the 31st of May, 1801, the Supreme Council of the thirty-third degree for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States of America, was opened with the high honors of Masonry, by Brothers John Mitchell and Fred - erick Daicho, Sovereign Grand Inspectors-General; and in the course of the year the whole number of Grand Inspectors-General was completed agreeably to the Grand Constitutions.

Space would not permit an examination of the trials of the Rite and the various questions that have arisen, all which are now harmoniously adjusted. It is sufficient for the purpose of this brief history to say, that in every respect it has realized all that the earliest founders of the Rite could have hoped for, and its pres - ent supporters desire. On the 20th of December, 1707, Deputy Inspector. General Franeken, appointed by Morin, opened and duly constituted a Grand Lodge of Perfection in Albany, State of New York. In 1 783, Deputy Inspector-General Hays established a Sublime Grand Lodge of Perfection in Charleston, South Carolina. On the 20th of February, 1788, a Grand Council ofPrinces of Jerusalem was opened in Charleston by Myers, Spitzer, and A. Forst, Deputy Inspector-Gen - eral for Virginia. In the year ~797, a chapter of Rose-Croix Do H.. R.. D.~. M.~. Knight of the Eagle add Pelican, was instituted in the City of New York. In this year, King Solomon’s Lodge of Perfection, at Holmes hole, Martha’s Vineyard, which had been established since 1783 by M. M.

About 1806—7, Consistories of Valiant and Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret were organized in the City of New York, and ren~ained so until the formation of the Supreme Council for the Northern Jurisdiction of the United States. Attention is again called to the year 1795, when Colonel John Mitchell was appointed by Spitzer a Deputy Inspector-General, in the place of Myers, who had removed; but he was restricted from acting until after Myers’ death, which took place in the following year. After the French Revolution of 1793, the mass of the people became atheists, and with them the great body of Masons; the Bible, as a general thing, was committed to the flames, and sublime Freemasonry fell into disuse; it was not until after the establishment of the Supreme Council at Charleston, in 1801, that the sublime system was revived in France, by the establish - ment of a Supreme Council at Paris, in 1804, by Count Do Grasse, Grand Inspector-General, under authority from the Charleston Council.

In 1825 a special grant to Brothers Fowler, Bryant, and McGill was issued by the Supreme Council for the Southern Jurisdiction, for the establishment of a Su - preme Council, thirty-third degr~e, in Dublin, Ireland. Thus from time to time Supremc Councils have been established in almost every nation of the globe. The following are extracts from the published report of the Southern Supreme Council, on the 4th day of December, 1802: “On the 21st of January, 1802, a warrant of Consti - tution passed the seal of the Grand Council of Princes of Jerusalem, for the establishment of a Master Mark Mason’s Lodge, in the City of Charleston, South Caro - lina.” “Besides those degrees which are in regular succession, most of the Inspectors are in possession of a number of detached degrees, given in different parts of the world; and which they generally communicate, free of expense, to those brethren who are high enough to understand them, such as ‘Select Masons of twenty- seven, and the Royal Arch as given under the Consti - tution of Dublin, six degrees of Ma9onnerie d’Adoption, Compagnon Ecossais, le Maitre Ecossais, and le Grand Maitre Ecossais,’ etc., etc., ma king in the aggregate fifty-three degrees.” As to the Mark and Past Master’s degrees, all author - ity over them was surrendered to the Royal Arch Chap. ters, ¶t.t that time springing into existence."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"HISTORY. 21 The Royal and Select Masters’ Degrees wre side ox detached degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.

They were called Secret Masters, and as in due time they were advanced to higher grades. and thus va - cancies were creatcd, others wero sclected to fill their places. But one guard was on duty at a time, yet seven wcre selected, and this is termed the mysterious number of this degrec, it having many allusions, to the sevon cardinal virtues; to happiness, to which our bretluen thought there were seven degrees; to the scvcn stages of life; to the seven laws or principles of Noah, given for the government of his posterity; and to the seven days of the wcck,—tlie last having been sct apart f6r the great teach - ing of this degree, Secrecy and Silencc.

Genuine Freemasonry, my brother, is a system of morals, and approaches religion: in fact, such was primitive Freemasonry.

A knowledge of its mysteries is not attained at once, but by degrees. Each degree in Ineffable Masonry is intended to inculcate a moral lesson and thl3 prac - tice of some particular virtue. Advances are made only by much instruction and assiduous application. Each step is progressive, and opens new light and information. According to the progress we make, we limit or extend our inquiries; and in proportion to our capacities, we attain a greater or less degree of perfection. Freemasonry is an allegorical system. Every doc - trine and ceremony has its mystical reference, which is not always apparent at the first blush; so that where the uninformed and weak find only mystery, the true initiate and thoughtful possess food for the employment of the noblest faculties. The true Ma - son will not rest satisfied with mere ceremonies, which in themselves are cold and heartless, but will study to comprehend their mystical signification. We, as Ineffable Masons, retain and continue -to practise these signs and symbols, because we believe they work closer into our hearts than mere words. * * * * * Permit me now, my brother, to receive you as a Secret Master, and give you rank among the Levites."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"i~~~IIiI SECEEI MASTER. 45 * * * * * The laurel, an emblem of victory, is to remind you of the conquest you ought to gain over your pas - sions; the olive, a symbol of peace, which should ever reign among us.

He appointed Tito, Prince of Herodim, to be the chief Provost and Judge, Adoniram, and Abda, his father, and four others learned in the law of Moses, to complete the number and constitute the Tribunal. They held their sit - tings in the middle chamber of the Temple, where the records of the Tribunal were kept, in a box of ebony, studded with precious gems, the key of which was committed to the Provosts or Judges; and there they considered and adjusted the demands and dif - ferences of the workmen, and determined all appeals from the judgment of a single Provost and Judge— administering the same laws to the Phomician as to the Hebrew, and endeavoring to do entire justice, according to the law of Moses, between man and man. * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"PROVOST AND JUDGE. 79 The necessity for a Court of Judges did not exist until after the death of the Grand Master Hiram, as the number of difficulties and dissensions among the workmen was not so numerous, and judgment was arrived at by the ready decisions of Hiram, which all quietly acquiesced in. As a Provost and Judge, it is your especial duty to render justice to all, to hear patiently, remember accurately, and weigh carefully the facts and the ar - guments offered. In our intercourse with others, there are two kinds of injustice: the first, of those who offer an injury; the second., of those who have it in their power to avert an injury from those to whom it is offered, and yet do it not. So active in - justice may be done in two ways—by force and by fraud. Respect not persons in judgment, but listen to the humble as well as to the great. Fear God., for judg - ment is God’s. While you would administer justice, show mercy. Exhibit the subduing influences of pity, the might of love, the control of mildness, the commanding ma - jesty of that perfect character which mingles grave displeasure with grief and pity for the offender. So brother Masons should treat their fellow Masons who go astray—not with bitterness, nor yet with good-natured easiness nor worldly indifference.

Therefore deal faithfully, but patiently and tenderly, with evil. Remember that it becomes not frail and sinful humanity to be vindictive towards even the worst of criminals. Perhaps we owe it solely to a kind Provi - dence having kept from us those temptations, under which we, too, like them, would have fallen. Finally, as a true Mason and Judge, always re - member the injunction : ~“ Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.” Beware of injury to your neighbor. If you have wronged another, you may grieve, repent, and reso - lutely determine against any such weakness in future; you may, so far as it is possible, make reparation. This is well. The injured party may forgive you, according to the meaning of human language, but the deed is done, and all the powers of Nature, were they to conspire in your behoif, could not make it undone; the consequences to the body, the conse - quences to the soul, though no man may perceive them, are there—are written in the annals of the past, and must reverberate throughout all time.

Pending these difficulties, on consultation, it was recommended by the High Priest, Sadoc, and Ahishar, Governor of the House, that five artificers, who had been pupils of Hiram, should be placed, as chiefs, over five departments in the construction of the edifice, and that at least the building could proceed, until they could find a Grand Master Architect. Adoniram, the son of Abda, was selected as the President of the Board of Architects, the others being Joabert, a Phenician, the chief artificer in brass; Stolkin, a Hebrew, chief carpenter; Selec, the Giblemite, chief stone-mason; and Gareb, a He - brew, chief worker in silver and gold, and chief en - graver. King Solomon was well aware that the zeal and abilities of these brethren would be exerted to the utmost in bringing to perfection so glorious a work. In like maimer, we expect you to do all in your power to promote the grand design of Masonry, and to bring to perfection the works of this Lodge of In - tendants of the Building, exercising and propagating charity and benevolence, educating the poor orphan, comforting the sick and distressed, and providing refuge for the unfortunate.

At the first hour of the night, the favorite of King S.’. and eight others, conducted by the stranger, travelled onward through a rough and dreary country toward the coast of Joppa. On the way, the most ardent of the nine, learning that the murderers were hidden in a cavern not far from where they then were, pressed on ahead, found the cavern, entered it with the shep - herd, where, by the dim light of the lamp, he discov - ered one of the assassins asleep, with a dagger at his"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"104 BOOK OF THE A.

The assassin had only time to say “Necum” [pro-. nounced ‘nay-coom], or “vengeance is taken,” and expired. Tim avenger then quenched his thirst at the fountain. When the eight arrived at the spot, they asked him what he had done. He replied, “I have slain the assassin of our Grand Master, and have performed a feat for the honor and glory of the Craft, for which I hope to be rewarded.” He then severed the head from the body, and taking it in one hand and his dagger in the other, with the eight re - turned to Jerusalem. In his zeal, however, he hast - ened into the presence of the king, passing the guards at the entrance. Solomon was at first very much offended that it had been put out of his power to take vengeance in the presence of, and as a warn - ing to, the rest of the workmen, and ordered the guards to put his favorite to death; but by the inter - cession of his brethren he was pardoned for his zeal, and they became reconciled.

Shortly afterward he received information that per - sons answering the description had lately arrived there, and, believing themselves to be perfectly se - cure, had begun to work in the quarry of Ben-Dekar. As soon as Solomon was made acquainted with this circumstance, he wrote to Maaka, King%f Gath, to assist in apprehending them, and to cause them to be delivered to persons he should appoint to secure them, and have them brought to Jerusalem to receive the punishment due to their crimes. Solomon then selected fifteen Masters in whom he could place the greatest confidence, and among whom were those nine who had been in the cavern, and sent them with an escort of troops in quest of the villains. Five days were spent in the search, when Zerbal, who bore King Solomon’s letter to King Maaka, with Stolkin and another of his companions, discovered them cutting stone in the quarry. They immediately seized them, and, binding them in chains, conducted them to Jerusalem.

HISTORY. C:. 0.. Compank;ns: this is the history and le - gend of this degree. Enoch, the son of Jared, was the sixth in descent from Adam. Filled with the Jove and fear of God, he strove to lead men in the way of honor and duty. In a vision the Deity ap - peared to him in visible shape, and said to him, “Enoch, thou hast longed to know my true name: arise and follow me, and thou shalt know it.” * * * * Enoch, accepting his vision as an inspiration, jour - neyed in search of the mountain he had seen in his dream, until, weary of the search, he stopped in the land of Canaan, then already populous with the de - scendants of Adam, and there employed workmen; and with the help of his son Methuselah, he exca - vated nine apartments, one above the other, and each roofed with an arch, as he had seen in his dream, the lowest being hewn out of the solid rock. In the crown of each arch he left a narrow aperture, dosed with a square stone, and over the upper one 7"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"146 BOOK OF TILE A. ANJ) A.

Upon a triangular plate of gold, inlaid with many precious gems, lie engraved the ineffable name of God, and sank the plate into one face of a cube of agate. * * * * * None knew of the deposit of the precious treas - ure; and, that it might remain undiscovered, and sur - vive the Flood, which it was known to Enoch would soon overwhelm the world in one vast sea of mire, lie covered the aperture, and the stone that closed it and the great ring of iron used to raise the stone, with the granite pavement of his primitive temple. Then, fearing that all knowledge of the arts and sciences would be lost in the universal flood, he built two great columns upon a high hill—one of brass, to resist water, and one of granite, to resist fire. On the granite column was written in hieroglyphics a description of the subterranean apartments; on the one of brass, the rudiments of the arts and sciences. The granite column was overturned and swept away, and worn to a shapeless mass by the Deluge, but that of brass stood firm, and was found by Noah. Thenceforward the true name & God remained un - known until he said unto Moses in Egypt, when he ordered him to go tQ Pharaoh, and cause him to send forth the children of Israel out of Egypt: “I am that which I was and shall be: I am the God of"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH OF ENOCH. 147 thy fat hers; the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. Thus shalt thou say unto the children ~f Israel, HE WHO IS hath sent me unto you. I am the Lord, that appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob by my name AL-SILEnT, but my name I did not show them.” Moses engraved the ineffable name upon a plato of gold, and deposited it in the ark of the covenant. Moses made the name known to Aaron and Joshua, and afterwards it was made known to the chief priests. The word being composed of consonants only, its true pronunciation was soon lost, but the word still remained in the ark; and in the time of Othuiel, in a battle against the King of Syria, those who bore the ark were slain, and the ark fell to the ground. After the battle, the men of Israel, search - ing for it, were led to it by the roaring of a lion, which, crouching by it, had guarded it, holding the golden key in its mouth. Upon the approach of the High-priest and Levites, he laid down the key, and withdrew. Hence, upon the golden key worn by the treasurer, you see the initials of these words: “In arc leonis verlntm inveni’ ‘—“ In. the lion’s mouth I found the word.” This plate of gold was melted down, and mado into an image of Dagon by the Philistines, who took it in battle.

Under this temple he built a secret vault, the approach to which was through eight other vaults, all under ground, and to which a long and narrow passage led under the king’s palace. In the ninth apartment was placed a twisted column of white marble, on which it was intended to place the ark, and in this apartment he held his private conferences with King Hiram of Tyre and H:.

Thus, my brother, by your meritorious and un.. blam able conduct, assiduity, constancy, and integ - rity, you have at last attained the title of Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason, which is the summit of Ancient Craft Masonry, and upon your arrival to which I most sincerely congratulate you. I most earnestly recommend to you the strictest care and circumspection in all your conduct, that the sublime mysteries of this degree be not profaned or disgraced. As to what remains of completing your knowledge of Ancient Craft Masonry, you will find, by attending to the following history of the degree, and a careful study of its mysteries. You will now proceed to the Grand Orator, in the South, who will instruct you in the HISTORY. U:. Or:. My brother, you were informed in the degree of Royal Arch that King Solomon builded a secret vault, the approach to which was through eight other vaults, all under ground, and to which a long and narrow passage led from the palace. The"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"PERFECT AN]) SUDLIME N[ASON. 171 ninth arch or vault was immediately under the Holy of Holies of ~he Temple. In that apartment King Solomon held his private conferences with King Hiram and Hiram Abiff. After the death of Hiram Abiff, the two kings ceased to visit it, resolving not to do so until they should select one to fill his place; and that, until that time, they would make known the sacred name to no one. After Adoniram, Joabert, and Stolkin had discovered the cube of agate and the mysterious name, and had delivered it to King Solomon, the two kings determined to deposit it in the secret vault, permit the three Masters who dis - covered it to be present, make known to them the true pronunciation of the ineffable word, constitute the last degree of Ancient Craft Masonry, and term it Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason. The cube of agate was so deposited. Afterward the twelve Princes of Ameth, the nine Elect, and the Chief Architect were admitted to this degree. The secret vault was thereafter called Sa - cred Yault, and was originally built by Hiram Abiff, and none but Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons knew of its existence, or knew other than the substituted worda The Temple was completed in the year 3OOO—si~ years, six months, and ten days after Ring Solomon had laid the first corner-stone; and its completion was celebrated with great pomp and splendid mag - nificence.

And when the singers and trumpeters were to make one sound in praise and thanks to the Lord, saying, “Praise the Lord, for he is good: his mercy endureth forever ;“ that the Temple was filled with a cloud, and the name was fully pronounced. On the second day, an audience was given to all Masons, from the degree of Master to the Royal Arch, and all vacancies were filled. On the third day, King Solomon devoted his time to advancing and raising Fellow Crafts and Entered Apprentices. Thus far the wise King of Israel behaved worthy ~ 1 f himself, and gained universal admiration; but in process of time, when he had advanced in years, his understanding became impaired; he grew deaf to the voice of the Lord, and was strangely irregular in his conduct. Proud of having erected an edifice to his Maker, and much intoxicated with his great power, he plunged into all manner of licentiousness and debauchery, and profaned the Temple by offer - ing incense to the idol Moloch, which only should have been offered to the living God. The Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons saw this, and were sorely grieved, being fearful that his apostacy would end in some dreadful consequences, and per - haps bring upon them those enemies whom Solomon had vainly and wantonly defied.

As an adequate punishment for this defection, God inspired the heart of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, to take vengeance on the kingdom of Israel This prince sent an army, with Nebuzar - adan, captain of the guards, who entered Judali with fire and sword, took and sacked the city of Jerusa - lem, razed its walls, and destroyed that superb model of excellence, the Temple. The people were carried away captive to Babylon, and the conquerors carried away with them all the vessels of gold and silver. This happened four hundred and seventy years, six months, and ten days after the dedication. After the city was taken, an~ the king’s palace and the Temple demolished, some of the Grand Elect Masons bethought themselves of the Sacred Yault and the inestimable treasure it contained. Repairing to the ruins of the Temple at night, they found that the way which led down to the vault had not been dis - covered, nor the slab of marble which covered it dis - turbed; but upon it they found the dead body of Galaad, an eminent brother, and Chief of the Levites. He had been iutrusted with the custody of the Sa - cred Yault and the care of the lamps that burned continually. * - * * * * Finally, when the time arrived that the Christian"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"174 BOOK OF THE A.

The valor and fortitude of these Elected Knights were such, that they were admired by, and took the lead of, all the Princes of Jerusalem, who, believing that their mysteries inspired them with courage and fidelity to the cause of virtue and religion, became desirous of being initiated. IJpon being found worthy, their desires were complied with, and thus the Royal Art, meeting the approbation of great and good men, became popular and honorable, and was diffused to the worthy throughout these dominions, and thus continued to spread, far and wide, through a succession of ages to the present day.

If devoid of worldly rank and dignity, it rises above all. All stations of life are subject to it.

What was my daughter Apame? With - out wealth or rank, before her beauty elevated her to the nuptial bed of Darius. To-day this great Prince rules over you. In her turn, she reigns over him. He wills what she desires—he does what she approves. Does she rejoice, he is pleased. Is she melancholy, he is afflicted. She is the soul that gives the impress and the bias to all his movements.

Reject! reject with indignation those sentiments of yourself that have just been uttered. Strength and power reside in kings. Beauty has its influence, but it is the mark of wisdom to acknowledge the empire of Truth. Truth is omnipotent—greater than any transitory throne—more endurable than any frail decaying beauty. These are both of sh6~t duration but truth lives forever. The power of kings, as well as that of beauty, is subject to the revolutions of chance. Truth changes never—always pure, always simple. It is the essence of the Grand Architect of the universe. It is the tie of all treaties. It is the motive of every just action, the basis of all laws, the seal of sovereign majesty, the object of every good man’s search. We love those who demonstrate it, and detest those who con - ceal it. Lying disguises it, and, by borrowing its appearance, furnishes the best proof and clearest avowal of its superiority. Considerations more pow - erful than human, 0 King, induce me thus to dare to speak to you in its favor, in opposition to the too flattering sentiments which might have seduced you from the true path.

The first fourteen degrees of Ineffable Masonry have reference to the construction of the first Tem - ple, the demolition of it by Nebuzaradan, under the authority of Nebuchadnezzar and Balthasar, and the conveying to Babylon of all the precious vessels and material; also, the driving into the fastnesses of the mountains and the uncultivated country all Masons of whatever grade. The fifteenth and sixteenth degrees have direct reference to the reconstruction of the Temple by Ze - rubbabel; first, by permission of Cyrus, King of Persia—as exemplified in the fifteenth degree—and then more completely by the sanction of his succes - sor, King Darius, who (with Artaxerxes) made every effort to restore the Temple in its beauty, a~d to re - furnish it with the precious vessels taken from th~ first edifice. After the sacking of Jerusalem, and the destruc - tion of King Solomon’s Temple, the Masons remained captives and exiles for seventy years, during all which period they kept faithfully their promise to rebuild the Temple of their God, by preserving some por - tions of the holy furniture and holding Masonic Lodges.

In the second year of the reign of King Darius, however, the High Priest succeeded in arousing a spirit of industry, and obtaining the consent of Zerubbabel to again make application for protection and liberty to rebuild the Temple. Darius, or Darayavuste, in the Persian part of the great triangular inscription at Behestun, on the fron - tier of ancient Media, reigned 485 years B. c. He was 29 years old when he ascended the throne, and reigned 36 years. The friendship of Darius for Zerubbabel, in his younger days, gave opportunity for the pressure of the suit of the Jews; and by the power of truth—as exhibited in the striking incident in the ceremony— permission in its amplest form was obtained from the king, and Zerubbabel created a Prince: which honor was confirmed by the Jews, and made a Ma.’ sonic grade of distinction. * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"“FREEMASONRY is csf heavenly birth; the pillars of Wis&m and Strength support it; its foundation-stone is Yirtue; its cem - ent, Charity.

They took the name of Princes of Jerusalem and Knights of the East and West, in memory of the place where this Order was first instituted, and because their doctrines came from East and West They have, ever since their first establishment, adhered to their customs and forms of reception.

My brother, this Preceptory is in the form of a heptagon, hung with crimson, and sprinkled with stars of gold. In each angle is a column, on the capitals of which, beginning at the southeast and going round by the southwest in regular succession, are the initials respectively of the words Beauty, Divinity, Wisdom, Power, Honor, Glory, and Force —the seven mystic characters of the pentagon, sig - nifying: Beauty, to adorn our works. Divinity, to study which is one of our principal aims. Wisdom, to invent and work. Power, to punish and confound the calumnies of wicked brethren and the profane. Honor is an indispensable quality in a Freemason, to labor with respectability.

Calumny, the worst of all, should be shunned as a vice which saps the very foundations of friendship and society. The Book of the Seven Seak, which only one can open, is Masonically explained as representing a Lodge or Council of Masons, which the all-puissant alone has the right or power to convene or open. The breaking of the first seal displayed a bow, ar - rows, and crown, signifying that the orders of this Preceptory should be executed with as much prompt - ness and exactitude as an arrow sent from a bow, and be received with as much submission as if they came from a crowned head. The second seal displayed the sword, denoting that this Preceptory and the order in general is always armed for its defence and to punish the guilty.

The sixth seat when opened caused the sun to be darkened and the moon to be changed to blood, as a representation of the power of Supreme Councils to interdict the works of inferior bodies, when irregu - lar, until they shall have acknowledged their error and submitted to the rules and regulations of the Craft. The seventh seal when broken was followed by silence, broken by the successive blasts of the seven trumpets, signifying that Freemasonry is extended over the surface of the earth on the wings of the wind and fame, and supports itself with honor. The perfume from the altar represents the good. odor of virtue, and denotes that the life of a good Freemason should be free from all reproach and perfumed by a good report.

This, my brother, is the first of the Phi - losophical degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, and the beginning of a course of instruction which will fully unvail the heart and inner mysteries of Masonry. iDo not despair because you have often seemed on the point of attaining the inmost light, and have as often been disappointed. In all time truth has been hidden under symbols, and often under a succession of allegories—where vail after vail had to be penetrated before the true light was reached and the essential truth stood revealed. We are about to approach those ancient religions which once ruled the minds of men, and whose ruins encumber the plains of the great Past, as the broken columns of Palmyra and Tadmor lie bleaching on the sands of the desert. They rise before us—those old, strange, mysterious creeds and faiths—shrouded in the mists of antiquity, and stalk dimly and unde - finedly along the line that divides time from eternity, and forms of strange, wild, startling beauty mingle in the vast throng of figures, with shapes monstrous, grotesque, and hideous.

While by the stu.dy of the learned and wise, it enriched itself with the most admirable principles of the religions of Egypt and Asia, it was changed in the wanderings of the people, by everything that was impure or seduc - tive in the pagan manners and superstitions. It was one thing in the time of Aaron and Moses, another in that of David and Solomon, and still another in that of Daniel and Phio. At the time when John the Baptist made his ap - pearance in the desert, near the shores of the Dead Sea, all the old philosophical and religious systems were approximating to each other, while the philoso - phers of Greece, all (except the disciples of Epi - curus) more or less Platonicians, seized eagerly upon the beliefs and doctrines of the East. The Jews and Egyptians, before then the most exclusive of all people, yielded to that eclectism which prevailed among their masters, the Greeks and Romans. It was held by a vast number, even during the preach - ings of Paul, that the writings of the Apostles were incomplete, that they contained only the germs of another doctrine, which must receive from the hands of philosophy not only the systematic arrangement which was wanting, but all the developments which lay concealed therein—mysteries handed down from generation to generation in esoteric tradition. * * * * * 11"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"NO.•.

This degree, like the one preceding it, is philosophical. The 011(1 of all philosophy is to free the mind from those encumbran - ces which hinder its progress toward perfection, and to raise it to the contemplation of immutable Truth and the knowledge of di - vine and spiritual objects.

Knight of the ~agIe and Pelican is one of the titles applied to a Rose-Croix H-IR-D-M Freemason; yet that degree is not strictly an order of knighthood, in the commonly received sense of the term. In these degrees, it is readily perceivable that we have now fully entered upon a long course of instruction into all the mys - tories of the esoteric doctrine. There are a number of Rose-Croix degrees differing in a meas - ure from each other in the work and in their teachings. The Alchenffcal or Hermetic Masons taught a different degree in all respects from the so-called (ihristia.n Rose-Croix; and they again a different one from the universal, tolerant, and more acceptable grade.

Each degree erects a platform on which the Israelite, the Mahommedan, and the Christian may stand side by side and hand in hand, as brethren.” Whatever your religion, your birth - place, or your language, you are among brethren.

Among Eastern nations at the present day has this method of solemnizing a pledge been retained. We learn from history, and our fathers of the Masonic faith, that in the ancient mysteries of Judea and Egypt, the newly initiated were presented with bread and wine as a symbol of the new life they were about entering upon, and that they were henceforth to be devoted to the laws of truth, and knowledge of their rights and duties.

Respectable and Perfect Knights, the feast of which we are about to partake is thus ordered: “On the 10th of the month of Nisan, they shall take to them every man a lamb, a lamb for a house; and if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbors next unto his house take it, according to the number of the souls.

All men who deserve to live desire to survive their funerals, and to live after - ward in the good that they have done mankind, rather than in the marble of men’s memories. Most men desire to leave some work behind them that may outlast their own day and generation: that is an instinctive impulse given by God, and is often found in the rudest human heart—the surest proof of the soul’s immortality and of the fundamental dif - ference between men and the wisest brutes.

Acolytes were exposed to tests, and compelled to perform acts, which, if real, would have been abominable, but being mere chimeras, were preposterous, and excited contempt. Eight hundred degrees of one kind and another were invented. Infidelity, Hermeticism, Jesuitry, were taught under the mask of Masonry. The rituals of the regular Orders, copied and imita - ted by ignorant men, became nonsensical and trivial. Candidates were niade to degrade themselves, and to submit to insults not tolerable to a man of spirit and honor. It has even been seriously questioned whether, notwithstanding the beautiful order and sys - tematic arrangement of the degrees in the Ancient and Accepted rite—free as they are from all incon - gruities, and perfect as the lessons are in the teach - ings of the various virtues—the number might not advantageously have been reduced, and thus Masonry have been simplified. In the heterogeneous mass of over eight hundred degrees called Masonry, was found Judaism and chiv - alry, superstition and philosophy, philanthropy and insane hatred, a pure morality and unjust and illegal revenge, strongly mated, and standing hand in hand within the temples of peace and concord; and the whole system was one grotesque commingling of in - congruous things and fine conceptions, overlaid and disfigured by absurdities engendered by ignorance, fanaticism, and senseless mysticism. ~1"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"GRAND MA8TER OF SYMBOLIC LODGES. 311 And empty and sterile pomp, with lofty titles arbi - trarily assumed, and to which the inventors had not condescended to attach any explanation that should acquit them of the folly of assuming temporal rank, power, and titles of nobility, made the world laugh and the initiate feel ashamed.

Com - posed at ftrst of a few Masons, who had learned the rules of justice from the teachings of the Order, they exerted only a moral influence, owing to the purity of their lives and the justice of their opinions.

Finding that where their influence was most needed, mere advice and exhor - tation, addressed to the rude Barons and haughty rapacious priesthood, had no effect, they assumed the power to enforce performance of their judgments; and through the common people and a multitude of the poorer Knights who had found the benefit of their protection, and who revered their justice, they found a ready means of compelling obedience and inflicting punishment.

Khiir~m, King of Tsur, in Phce - nicia, and Khiirfim Abai, also a Phcenician and not a Jew, were likewise initiates; and hence the inti~ mate connection between them and Solomon, as Masons. The people of Tsidun, a city of Phoenicia, were employed by Noah to cut cedars on Mount Libanus, of which to build the ark, under the super - intendence of Japhet. His descendants repeopled Tsidun and Phoenicia, and procured and furnished the cedar from Lebanon to build the Ark of the Covenant; and at a later day his posterity, under Adon Khi~rfim, cut in the same forests cedars for King Solomon; and at a time still later, they felled timber on the same mountains to construct the second temple. Upon the same mountain they established Col - leges of Artificers, like those in Etruria, and after - ward at Rome; from which latter many deduce Masonry. But the Etrurians, who emigrated from Assyria to Egypt and afterward to Etriiria—better known as the Hykos, from Resen on the Tigris, or as the Shepherd Kings—carried with them the same mysteries, which went also with them into Phoenicia; and the Etrurian and ]~oman Colleges were in all respects like those of Mount Libanus.

It is~made to be carried by staves of light wood, banded with brass, passing through rings in two of the sides. Between this altar and the Tabcrnacle is a layer or large basin of bronze, with a foot to it, filled with water. In the front part of the tent, in front of the vail, on the North side, is the Table of the Presence or Shew - bread. It is made of white wood, and is three and a half feet long, one and a half feet broad, and two and one-fourth feet high, the top covered with plates of brass, gilded, and with a gilded rim or border round its edge on the top.

Before the middle of the vail, and. in the outer part of the tent, is the altar of incense, eighteen inches square and three feet high, with flames or horns of brass at each corner, the top covered with a plate of yellow metal, imitating gold, with a rim of the same round it, and two gold rings on each of two opposite sides, below the rim, for gilded staves or rods to pass through, by which to carry it. In the centre of the inner portion of the tent (the D’~’~p ~‘T Kadosh .Kado8him, or Holy of Holies,) stands the Ark of the Covenant, of wood, three and three-fourth feet long, two and one-fourth feet broad, and two and one-fourth feet high, with short feet at each corner.

In the early days of Christianity, there was an initiation like those of the Pagans. Persons were admitted on special conditions only. To arrive at a complete knowledge of the doctrine, they had to pass three degrees of instruction. The initiates were consequently divided into three classes: the first, auditors, the second, catechumens, and the third the faithful. The auditors were novices, pre - pared by ceremonies and instruction to receive the dogmas of Christianity. A portion of these dogmas was made known to the Catechumens; who, after particular purifications, received baptism, or the initiation of the theo genesis (divine generation); but in the grand mysteries of that religion, the incarna - tion, nativity, passion, and resurrection of Christ, none were initiated but the faithful. These doc - trines, and the celebration of the holy sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, were kept with profound secrecy. * * * * * To avoid persecution, the early Christians were compelled to use great precaution, and to hold meet - ings of the faithful [of the household of faith] in private places, under concealment by darkness.

The wounded German soldiers, whom none of the others under - stood, could not make known their sickiiess nor their necessities. Certain German nobles from the cities of Bremen and Lubec, who had arrived at Acre by sea, moved by the miseries of their countrymen, took the sails of their ships, and made them a large tent, in which for a time they placed the wounded Germans, and tended them with great kindness. Forty nobles of the same nation united with them, and established a kind of hospital in the midst of the camp; and this noble and charitable association, like the Knights of the Temple and of St. John of Jerusalem, soon and insensibly became a new Hos - pitaller and Military Order. This was in the year 1191. In 1192, Pope Celestin III., at the request of the Emperor Henry VI., ~olemn1y approved of the Order, by his bull of the 23d of February. He pre - scribed, as regulations for the new Knights, those of St. Augustine; and for special statutes, in all that regarded the poor and the sick, those of the Hos - pitallers o~ St. John; in regard to military discipline."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"896 BOOK OF THE A.

This new Order, exclusively composed of Germans, was styled “The Order of Teutonic Knights of the House of St. Mary of Jerusalem ;“ as the Templars were styled, “of the House of the Temple at Jerusalem.” A great number of noblemen, who had followed that Prince (Frederic of Suabia, second son of the Emperor) to Acre as volunteers, some actuated by religious enthusiasm, and some by the desire of glory, joined the soldiers of the Temple and of the Hospital, or eiigaged in attending on the wounded and caring for the sick of their nation. This was the origin of the Teutonic Order, the first branch of that of the Templars. The chiefs, desiring to advance these pious gentle - men and to gratify the German nation, proposed to them the institution of a new Order of Chivalry, to be at once hospitaller and military. Forty German lords, distinguished by their nobility and feats of arms, agreed to these, and became the founders and original members of the Order. On entering the Order, they bound themselves by the three solemn vows, and also obliged themselves to serve the poor, in imitation of the Hospitallers, and to follow the claustral and military discipline of the Templars, in peace as well as in war. Their title of Knights of the House of St. Mary of Jerusalem was given them, because while the city of Jerusalem was under the government of the Latin Christians, a German had erected there, at his"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"KNIGHT CO~I2IAI~DER OF THE TEMPLE. 397 own expense, a hospital and oratory for the sick of his nation, under the protection of, and dedica Led to, the Virgin Mary. * * * * * To distinguish this Order from the other two, they adopted the black cross. It is ordinarily said that they also adopted the white mantle; but about the year 1210, the Templars of Palestine complained to Pope Innocent, that after they had received from the Holy See the white mantle as the distinctive dress of their Order, the Teutonic Knights, and especially those of St. Jean d’Acre, had assumed to wear it. Innocent wrote to the latter, and to their Grand Master, Herman Bart, a gentleman of Holstein, and directed that, in order to avoid all occasion for jealousy or quarrel, they should content themselves with their ordinary dress, and leave the white color to the Templars; and at the same time he ordered the Patriarch of Jerusalem to see to it that the Teti - tonic Knights should follow their first custom, and to censure, and so compel them to do it, if necessary. It is true that they paid little regard to the man - date of the Pope, and soon adopted the white man - tle again; but it was not their primitive dress; and therefore we, in this degree, wear a different color. The leading objects of the three great military orders were the same. The Teutonic Knights soon rivalled the other orders in numbers and influence."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"398 BOOK OF THE A. AND A.

After the Order of the Temple had been “sup - pressed, extinguished, and abolished,” in the year 1312, by the papal bull of the 6th May of that year, by which all persons were forbidden to enter the Order, or to assume the name of Templars, or to wear their dress, under pain of excommunication, an extension of the same, in the same year, adjudged all the property and estates of the Templars to the Knights of Rhodes (of St. John, or the Hospitallers, afterward Knights of Malta), except such as were in the realms of Spain, and without prejudice to the right of any kings, princes, or lords to any property of the Order in other countries.

THERE is but one God, uncreated, eternal, infinite, and inacces - sible: that the soul of man is immortal, and his existent life but a point in the centre of eternity: that harmony is in equilibrium, and equilibrium subsists by the analogy of contraries: that anal - ogy is the key of all the secrets of nature, and the sole reason of being of all revelations: and, finally, that the Absolute is REASON, which exists through itself: that evil, and wrong, and misery are the necessary discords that unite with the concords of the uni - verse to make one great harmony forever. Such is the argument of this the last philosophical degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite; its doctrine is derived from the Kabala, and is the same as that of the Hermetic philosophers who wrote on Al - chemy.

But little of the immense amount of instruction con - tained in the degree of Knight of the Sun can be given in a manual of the rite; the degree is voluminous, and the monitorial parts are extensive, and it is deemed more appropriate that they should be laid before the stu - dent and neophyte directly from the ritual in the hands of the Commander-in-chief of the Consistory. The fol - lowing points are however inscribed. * * * * * 1. Science is preserved by silence, and perpetu - ated by initiation. The law of silence is absolute and. inviolable, only with respect to the unitiated multitude. Science makes use of symbols; but for its transmission, language also is indispensable; wherefore the sages must sometimes speak. — But when they speak, they do so, not to disclose or to explain, but to lead others to seek for and find the truths of Science and the meaning of the sym - bols. * * * * * 2. The Hermetic Masters said, “Make gold po - table, and you will have the universal medicine.” By this they meant to say, appropriate truth to your use, let it be the spring from which you shall drink all your days, and you will have in yourselves the immortality of the sages. We are the authorsd of"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"410 BOOK OF THE A. AND A. RITE. our own destinies; and God does not save us with4 out our co-operation. — Death is not, for the sage. It is a phantom which the ignorance and weakness of the multitude make horrible. Change is the evidence of movement, and movement reveals life alone. Even the body would not be decomposed if it were dead. All the atoms that compose it retain life, and move to free them - selves. The spirit is not the first to be disengaged, that it may live no longer. Can thought and love die, when the basest matter does not? — If change should be called death, we die and are born again every day; for every day our forms change. Let us fear, then, to go out from and rend our garments, but let us not dread to lay them aside when the hour for rest comes! * * * * * 3. The divine light, that outshining of the su - preme reason or word of the Deity, “which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,” has not been altogether wanting to the devout of any creed. The permanent revelation, one and universal, is written in visible nature, is explained by reason, and comple - ted by the wise analogies of faith. — Faith has in all ages been the lever whereby to move the world. * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE sun. 411 4. There is no invisible world. There are only different degrees of perfection in the organs. — The body is the gross representation, and, as it were, the temporary envelope of the soul. — - The soul can perceive, by itself, and without the intervention of the bodily organs, by means of its sensibility and lucidity, the things, whether spirit - ual or corporeal, that exist in the universe. — There is no void in nature; all is peopled. — There is no real death in nature; all is living. * * * * * 5. What we call death is change. The supreme reason, being unchangeable, is therefore imperish - able. Thoughts, once uttered, are immortal. Is the source or spring from which they flow less immortal than they? How could the thoughts exist, if the soul from which they emanated were to cease to be? Could the universe, the uttered thoughts of God, continue still to exist if he no longer were? * * * * * 6. Nature is the primary, consistent, and certain revelation or unveiling of God. It is his utterance, word, and speech. Whether he speaks to us though a man, must depend, even at first, on human testi - mony, and afterward on hearsay or tradition. But in and by his work we know the Deity, even as we know the mind of another man, and his thoughts, by his acts and words. We can no more be faco to face"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"412 BOOK OF THE A. AND A. RITE. with the soul of another man than we can with God. * * * * * 7. Analogy is the last word of science, and the first of faith. —Harmony is in equilibrium; and equilibrium subsists by the analogy of contraries. —The absolute unity is the supreme and last reason of things. This reason can neither be one person or three persons: it is one reason, and the reason, surpassing and transcendent. * * * * —Religions seem to be written in heaven and in all nature. That ought to be so; for the work of God is the book of God, and in what he writes we ought to see the expression of his thought, and con - sequently of his being; since we conceive of him only as the supreme thought. * * * 1’ * In the West, over the Warden, you behold the holy and mysterious pentagram, the sign of the microcosm, or universe, called in the Gnostic schools “The blazing star,” the sign of intellectual omnipo - tence and autocracy, which has been partially ex - plained to you heretofore.

It is the universe contained within the Deity. It is a sign ancient as history and more than his - tory; and the complete understanding of it is the key of the two worlds. It is the absolute philosophy and natural science. All the mysteries of Magism, all the symbols of the gnosis, all the figures of the occult philosophy, all the kabalistic keys of prophecy, are summed up in the sign of the pentagram, the greatest and most potent of all signs. The white dove and black raven in the West repre - sent the two principles of Zoroaster and Manes, good and evil, light and darkness; and the fourth and fifth sephiroth of the KabaJa, the mercy or benignity, and the justice or severity of the Deity. * * * * * The candidate in the ancient initiations surrendered without reservation his life and liberty to the Masters of the Temples of Thebes or of Memphis; he ad - vanced resolutely amid innumerable terrors, that might well lead him to suppose that it was intended to take life.

The ]3rah- mm, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Catholic, the protestant—each professing his peculiar religion, uanctioned by the laws, by time, and by climate— may retain their faith, and yet may be Masons. Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenets of the old primitive faith, which underlie and are the foundation of all religions. Masonry is the universal morality which is suitable to the inhabitants of every clime—to the man of I every creed. It has taught no doctrines except those truths that tend directly to the well-being of I man; and those who have attempted to direct it toward useless vengeance, political ends, the Kab -"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"428 1300K OF THE A.

The best, and, indeed, the only good Mason, is he who, with the power of labor, does the work of life— the upright mechanic, merchant, or farmer—the man who exercises the power of thought, of justice, or of love—whose whole life is one great act of perform - ance of Masonic duty. The natural work of Ma.. sonry is practical life: the use of all the faculties in their proper spheres and for their natural functions. Love of truth, justice, and generosity, as attributes of God, must appear in a life marked by these quali - ties. The natural form of Masonry is goodness, morality, living a true, just, affectionate, self-faithful life, from the motive of a good man. It is loyal obedience to God’s law. The good Mason does that which is good, which comes in his way, from a love of duty; and not merely because a law enacted by man or God commands his will to do it. Not in vain does the poor or oppressed look up to him. You find such men in all Christian sects, Protestant and Catholic; in all the great religious parties of the civilized world—among Buddhists, Mahometans, and Jews. They are kind fathers, generous citizens, and unimpeachable in their business: you see their Ma - sonry in their works and in their play. The true Mason loves not only his kindred and his country, but all mankind; not only the good, but also the evil among his brethren. Though the ancient and the"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"E~IGIIT OF ST. ANDREW. 429 honorable of the earth bid him bow down to them, his stubborn knee bends only at the bidding of his manly soul. His Masonry is his freedom before God, not his bondage unto men. The old theologies, the philosophies of religion of ancient times, will not suffice us now; there are errors to be made way with, and their places supplied with new truths, radiant with the glories of heaven. There are great wrongs and evils in Church and State, in domestic, social, and public life, to bo righted and outgrown. Masonry cannot in our age forsake the broad way of life; she must journey on in the open street, appear in the crowded square, and teach men by her deeds—her life—more eloquent than any lips. This degree is much devoted to Toleration, and it inculcates in the strongest manner that great leading idea of the Ancient Art—that a belief in the one true God, and a moral and virtuous life, constitute the only religious requisites needed to enable a man to be a Masob. It has ever the most vivid remembrance of the terrible and artificial torments that were used to put down new forms of religion or extinguish the old. It sees with the eye of memory the ruthless extermina - tion of all the people, of all sexes and ages—because it was their misfortune not to know the God of the Hebrews, or to worship him under the wrong name— by the savage troops of Moses and Joshua. It sees the thumbscrews and the racks; the whip, the gal-"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"430 BOOK OF THE A. AND A.

It sees Cranmer hold his arm, now no longer erring, in the flame, until the hand drops off, in the consuming heat. It sees the persecutions of Peter and Paul, the martyrdom of Stephen, the trials of Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin, and Iren~us; and then, in turn, the sufferings of the wretched Parrans under the Christian emperors, as of the Papists in Ireland, and under Elizabeth and the besotted Henry; and all that in all ages have suffered by hunger and nakedness, peril and prison, the rack, the stake, and the sword—it sees them all, and shudders at the long roll of human atrocities. Man never had the right to usurp the unexercised prerogative of God, and condemn and punish another for his belief. Born in a Protestant land, we are of that faith: if we had opened our eyes to the light under the shadows of St. Peter’s at Rome, we should have been devout Romanists; born in the Jewish quarter of Aleppo, we should have contemned Christ as an impostor; in Constantinople, we should have cried, “Allah il Allah—God is great, and Mahomet is his Prophet.” Birthplace and education give us our faith.

We believe what we are taught; and those are most fanatical who know least of the evidences on which their creed is based. What is truth to me is not truth to another. The same arguments and evidences that convince one mind, make no impression on another: this differ - ence is in men at their birth. No man is entitled positively to assert that lie is right, where other men, equally intelligent and equally well-informed, hold directly the opposite opinion. Each thinks it im - possible for the other to be sincere; and each, as to that, is equally in error. “What is truth ?“ was a profound question—the most suggestive one ever put to man. Many beliefs of former and present times seem incomprehensible. They startle us with a new glimpse into the human soul—that mysterious thing, more mysterious the more we note its workings. Here is a man, superior to myself in intellect and learning, and yet he sincerely believes what seems to me too absurd to merit confutation; and I cannot conceive, and sincerely do not believe, that he is both sane and honest; and yet, he is both.

That we ourselves believe and feel absolutely certain that our own belief is true, is, in reality, not the slightest proof of the fact, seem it never so certain and incapable of doubt to us. Therefore no man hath, or ever had, a right to persecute another for his belief; for there cannot be two antagonistic rights; and if one can persecute another because he himself is satisfied that the belief of that other is erroneous, the other has, for the same reason, equally as certain a right to persecute him. The truth comes to us as the image of a rod comes to us through the water, bent and distorted: an ar - gument sinks into and convinces the mind of one man, while from that of another it rebounds most quickly. It is no merit in a man to have a particu - lar faith, excellent, and sound, and philosophic as it may be. It is no more a merit than his prejudices and his passions. The sincere Moslem has as much right to perse - cute us, as we to persecute him; and therefore Ma - sonry wisely requires no more than a belief in one great, all-powerful Deity, the Father and Preserver of the universe. Therefore she teaches her votaries that toleration is one of •the chief duties of every good Mason.

The whole tenor of the life of the benevolent Founder of the Christian religion was unremitting benevolence; his ~kind offices were extended alike to Gentiles and Jews, to publicans and sinners, as well as to his disciples. Yet Masonry is eternally vigilant that no atheist or base libertine contaminates with his unhallowed tre~?d the sanctum sanctorum of our temple; such can never gain admission there, without the grossest violation of vows the most sacred and solemn. It requires the acknowledgment of the existence of the Grand Master of the Universe, and to reverence his great and sacred name, irrespective of sectarian ideas; in a word, to practise every virtue which adorns and ennobles the human character, and fly every vice which sullies and degrades it. It inca! - cates a generous love for all mankind, it matters not of what religious creed.

Merely to tolerate, to bear with an opposing opinion, is to assume it to be hereticiLl, and assert the right to persecute, if we would, and claim our toleration as a merit. The Mason’s creed goes further than that; no man, it holds, has any right, in any way, to interfere with the religious belief of another. It holds that each man is absolutely sovereign as to his own belief, and that belief is a matter absolutely foreign to all who do not entertain the same belief; and that if there were any right of persecution at all, it would in all cases be a mutual right, because one party has the same right as the other to sit as judge in his own case—and God is the only magistrate that can right - fully decide between them. To that Great Judge Masonry refers the matter; and, opening wide its portals, it invites to enter there, and live in peace and harmony, the Protestant, the Catholic, the Jew, the Moslem—every one who will lead a truly virtuous and moral life, love his breth - ten, minister to the sick and distressed, and believe in the One, AU-Powerful, All-Wise, Everywhere- Present God—Architect, Creator, and Preserver of all things—by whose universal law of Harmony ever rolls on this universe: the great, vast, infinite circle of successive death and life; to whose ineffable name let all true Masons pay profoundest homage! for whose thousand blessings poured upon us let us feel the sincerest gratitude, now, henceforth, and forever.

The Thrice Potent Grand Master, Senior and Junior Grand Wardens, and the Grand Master of Ceremonies, are the only officers entitled to the Secret Directory. On the production of a certificate of theli’ election, duly signed and sealed, the following ceremonies are observed. RECEPTION. A Council of Princes of Jerusalem being opened: The Grand Master of Ceremonies retires to the anteroom, and pre - pares the candidate by divesting him of his hat, shoes, etcetera; hood - winks him, and conducts him to the door of the Council Chamber, where the Guard announces his approach hy the sound of a trum - pet, which is answered from within by the Grand Master of Entrances.

In the first year of his reign the brethren assembled by order of that king, for the purpose of reorganizing the Lodge of Perfec - tion, but being unable to discover the Secret Directory, they could not fully effect their purpose. They therefore passed a decree that the next candidate for an office in the Lodge of Perfection, before he took his seat as such, should make diligent search for the same. This decree was carried into effect on the admission of the next candidate, who discovered the Secret Directory in the manner you have represented; and in consequence of this dis - covery the secrets of Ineffable Masonry were again communi - cated to worthy brethren from generation to generation.

My brother, your ready assent to Hi e charges and regulations of the order, justifies the confidence which your breth - ren have reposed in you, and authorizes me to proceed with your installation. You cannot have advanced to the degree which you have attained in our rite without becoming acquainted with the requisites necessary to constitute an efficient Master of a Lodge of Perfection, with the duties that devolve upon the position, and of the serious responsibility which he incurs. The honor, reputation, and usefulness of your Lodge will chiefly depend upon the mode in which you discharge the duties of your office. If you .should be satisfied with merely knowing by rote the formulas, the phrases, and ceremonies of the work, and end with that, you may maintain good order and conduct the work with regularity, but you will soon see indifference suc - ceed to zeal, inattention to punctuality, lassitude to interest, and stagnant immobility to activity. You cannot satisfy your promise never to open and close your Lodge without giving a lecture, or some portion thereof, for the instruction of the brethren, by asking a few trivial questions of routine. It would be absurd to require of you to take a solemn obligation to do that; and a sad matter if Masonry would so cheapen its oaths. Whenever your Lodge is closed, and an evening has passed away without your having given the brethren some new and use - ful information, you will have failed to do your duty. Think not that the field of Masonic learning has been so often reaped and gleaned that there is nothing left for you to gather. Its history has never yet been written. Its symbols are only in part understood. Its philosophy is a vast region almost wholly unexplored. You are to arouse the indolent, encourage the de - sponding, and incite the unreflecting brethren to do something the influences whereof shall be felt beyond the limits of the Lodge— something for society, something for humanity.

In rcspect to this, as well as in all other moral and sceial du - ties, sublime Freemasonry has its rewards and punishments, its obligations and vows, as well as its fundamental laws and regu - lations, which every honest and true brother is willing to be gov - ern’?d and abide by; and neither in this regard, nor in any other, cart they be broken with impunity. The mystic mysteries of religion and science which formed the foundation upon which the superstructure of Ineffable Masonry ha9 been erected, covered so large a field of investigation and study, and involved so many abstruse and critical points, that unless thcy were set forth in technical and orthodox phraseology, or at least that certain of the more abstruse portions of the Secret Directory were preserved in some character, hieroglyphic or otherwise, their vitality and truthfulness would be destroyed, and in a few generations no trace or resemblance of their original character would remain. Our society is maintained upon the broad principles of render - ing mutual aid and of exercising mutual love and friendship, as well as to preserve our adoration of the Almighty Artist, and to improve our minds with the principles of science. The history of Masonry, as contained in the higher degrees, gives an account of events only to be found in the archives of our sublime institution, which could not be committed to memory without constant application br a lifetime; therefore, had the same course been adopted in the perpetuation of these degrees as that prescribed for the symbolic Lodge, they would long ere this have been lost to the world and have been buried in oblivion.

Sublime Princes, the world is filled with the ruins of temples, erected by the ancients to their imaginary deities. In Egypt, India, Ethiopia, and Chaldea, the lover of antiquity and the eager student gaze enraptured on the huge remains of mighty edifices sorely stricken by the rekntless hand of time, in which, when they stood in all their spkndor and glory in that East, teeming with the hosts of its mighty population, ATHOMOI and AI~ifoN, BRAHMA and BUDDAR, TOTH and B~L were wor - shipped. The great cavern temples of Eleplianta, Salsette, Garnac, Luxor, awl Thebes, still remain to astound us with their vastness. The sculptured columns of an hundred fanes builded to the gods of Olympus, and enriched with all that was rare and wondrous in architecture, painting, and statuary, still remain, some standing and some fallen and broken on the classic soil of Greece. The artist is familiar with the great temples reared to the gods in Rome; and the ruins of ELruscan sanctu - aries still tempt the antiquarian. While Hiram worshipped in the Temple of ~e1us, builded by his ancestors in his royal city of Tyre, Solomon, whom masonry claims for its Grand Master, erected the first Temple at Jerusa - lern, believing that the infinite and omnipotent God would come down and dwell therein, and utter his oracles from between the extended wings of the cherubim on the mercy-seat; whither the priests repaired to consult the Shekina, or oracle of God. The Mahonictan rears his mosques, tho children of Israel their synagogues, and the Christian his churches, devoted to the wor - ship and disputes of an hundred sects. To adorn the cathedrals of the great Catholic world, the arts contributed their most glorious works; and there the great productions, of the genius of Angelo and Raphael, and many other immortal painters and sculptors, yet remain unapproachable in beauty and sublin~ity, to be imi - tiited an4 copied, but never to be equalled.

The cardinal principles of Free Masonry are Charity and Toleration. Accord - ing to its principles, ambition, rivalry, ill-will, and the jealousies and disputes of sects, cannot cross the threshold of its sanctuaries and enter within their sacred walls; and yet such are the frailties and imperfections of man, that they do find entrance there; sect denounces sect, and even borrows of an intolerant church its weapons to smite down heresies withal. Into this temple, my brethren, which we are now about to inaugurate, into this Consistorial Chamber of our beautiful and beloved Ancient and Accepted rite, let no such unholy visitors ever intrude; let ambition and rivalries, jealousies and heart - bw~nings, never effect an entrance within its portals!

A new Consistory is about to be i’eceived into the sisterhood of those eminent bodies, and your Masonic virtues, your intelligence, ardor, and zeal, give us reason to hope that its career will be one of great prosperity and good fortune. The propagation of the Ancient and Accepted rite has hereto - fore been slow. This has been owing in part to the prejudices entertained against it, in part to the inertness of those who have been at its head, and in part to the fact that it is meant to be an exclusive and not a popular rite, that it selects the best and the most eminent Masons for its members, desires no others, and is better content to remain stationary than to open its doors to any one that asks admission, and is able to pay the fee. In the name and by the direction of the Supreme Council, I chai~ge it upon you, my brethren, that you will adhere to, a.nd be governed by this rule; that you select none but eminent, enlightened, and well-informed Masons of irreproachable char - acter, and respectable standing in society, to become members of your body; and that you earnestly and urgently impress the same rule upon your subordinates.

To the Grand Minister of State. Sublime Prince , you have been elected to the office of Grand Minister of State of this Consistory, in which office is in - cluded that of Grand Orator. The office is one of labor and re - sponsibility. He who accepts it should be capable of edifying and instructing his brethren. He must address the Consistory on proper occasions, pronounce discourses to candidates, give his opinion, when required by the Commander-in-Chief, upon ques - tions of Masonic Law, and read essays and lectures upon Masonic subjects, when requested by the Consistory. He must therefore make himself familiar with the constitutions, regulations, insti - tutes and statutes, with Masonic law and philosophy, with the doctrines of the rite, and the history of the order. I need not tell you that all this requires intellect and study, and no one can do a graver injury to Masonry, than he who occupies a high and important office, and then neglects its duties. It is when little or no real instruction is given in symbolic Lodges, no essays are read there, and all the learning and doctrine of the order are neglected, that their meetings become uninteresting, tiresome, and unprofit - able. The field before you is vast, my brother, and will afford ample scope for your intellect and learning, and I trust that your breth - ren will have cause to rejoice that they have selected you to labor in it. You will now take your station at the right of the Illustri. ous Ocr u ty Commander-in-Chief."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"INSTALLATION. 647 To the Grand Chancellor.

The following ceremony, called MAsoNic BAPTISM, Is frequently performed in Europe, but has not been generally adopted in the United States. It is inserted here as an interesting subject of information, and for use, when required. This ceremony can be conferred only by a Lodge of Perfection or Symbolic Lodge; and when by the former, it works in the Entered Apprentice degree. A child of either sex may be baptized by this ceremony alone, until it has attained the age of twelve years if a boy, and of eighteen if a girl. A boy over the age of twelve years can be baptized only when received a Louveteau, or adopted; and a girl over eighteen only when adopted. The ceremony is particularly intended for infants. It secures to either boy or girl the protection and assistance of the Lodge and the brethren; and, in the case of a boy, the right to be re - ceived a Louveteau at the age of twelve years. In any case, the father of the child must be a Mason, or its mother the daughter of a Mason. In the latter case, the child may be baptized, but, though a boy, cannot become a Louveteau. The father or grandfather, as the case may be, must be, if living. or must have been, it’ dead, at the time of his death an affiliated Mason, unless his non-affiliation is, or was, not attrihutable to his own fault, indifference, or neglect; and this rule, also, is relaxed where the mother is a ward or adopted child of the Lodge."},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"556 BOOK OF TFIE A. AND A. BITE. PRELIMINARIES. It needs no vote of the Lodge to consent to the baptism of a child. Every one that comes within the conditions is entitled to it as of right. If inquiry is necessary, however, to ascertain the facts, a committee may be appointed; and in case of doubt whether non-affiliation of the father or grandfather is or has been, under the circumstances, excusable, the Lodge will decide by a majority of votes. When a child is to be baptized, the Lodge will proceed to select a brother of the Lodge to be its godfather, and the wife or sister of a brother of the Lodge to be its godmother. Vacancies in these offices will be filled by the Lodge, from time to time, as they occur, until the child, if a boy, reaches the age of twelve years; and if a girl, of twenty-one, or until she marries. The Lodge will then appoint a delegation of three members to communicate with the parent or parents of the child—or, if he have none living or competent to act, then with its nearest rela - tives—to obtain their consent to the baptism, and secure their presence at the ceremony. If the child be of such age as that it Is proper for itself to be consulted, the delegation will do that also. If it have no father, or if he be unable, unfit, or unwilling to assist at the ceremony, the delegation will, if possible, arrange with one of its nearest relatives, male, to act as its father in the ceremony. If they cannot, they will select a Past Master of the Lodge, or, if there be none, some other past officer, to act in the place of its father. So, if it have no mother or 0th.? near female relative, able, fit, and willing to assist at the ceremony, they will select the wife, sister, or daughter of some brothe~ of the Lodge, to act in the place of its mother. They will procure white garments for the child, and, if they be unable to procure them for themselves, garments of black for the father, and of white for the mother. They will also procure a locket for the child, if it be a girl un - der ten years of age, or a bracelet if over that age; and if it be a boy, a ring, and make whatever other arrangements that are necessary. The ceremony being a public one, public notice may be given."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"CEBEM0I~Y OF BAPTISM. 557 ARRANGEMENT OF THE HALL OR LODGE. The arrangement of the hall is brilliant, hung with garlands and strewed with flowers. CEREMONIAL. When the spectators have taken their seats, the Lodge is opened in the degree of Entered Apprentice or PerfectiDn, in a room adjacent to the hall, and proceeds thither in procession, the members and visiting brethren together, and in due order. Instead of opening in E. A., the Lodge will be opened in the degree of Perfection. The procession will be formed in the following order: 1. Captain of Guard. 2. Members by two’s. 3. Officers in reverse order of rank. 4. Celebrant. 5. Sovereign Grand Inspectors General. Every member in the procession must be in regalia. On entering the Lodge, the procession will proceed up the mid dIe aisle, and then file right and left to their seats. The organ will play a march, until all are seated. The greatest decorum will be observed. Then the Master S which is answered by each or the Wardens in turn, rises and says: W~ .Af~ The solemnity which calls us to meet together to-day is one which most eminently accords with the purposes and spirit of our institution. It is not a mere idle and showy ceremonial, designed to obtrude ourselves upon the notice of the world, or to give an empty title to those who are as yet too young to appreciate and understand. Masonic Baptism was instituted far more for the parents than for the children, while it affords each father an occasion for renew - ing his own obligations. He, also, by concurring in an act which impresses upon his child of his own sex, in advance, the charac - ter of Mason, and which gives it, of either sex, a right to the pro - tection and careful guardianship of the Lodge, obliges himself of"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"558 BOOK OF TIlE A. AND A. RITE. necessity to rear it in the principles of Freemasonry; to teach ii generosity, charity, and beneficence; to mould it, as it were, from its earliest years in such fashion that virtue shall be its habit, and love of its fellow-creatures its instinct. In our ceremony of Baptism we neither imitate nor have it in view to supply the place of any religious rite of any church. For baptism is not the exclusive property of religion. As the natural symbol of purification of the soul, it was used in the ancient mys - teries and solemnities of India, Egypt, and Greece. When the aspiranf to a knowledge of these old mysteries cleansed his body with water, he did so as a pledge that he would in like manner cleanse his soul and spirit from vice and immorality. It was not imagined that the ceremony itself had any healing virtue, or con - ferred holiness upon the recipient. From these mysteries, from Eleusis and Sainothrace, and from the Essenes, this rite has come to us by legitimate transmission, and we use it in no spirit of irreverence, but in the simple sense in which it was used in the land watered by the Nile, before the building of the Pyramids. The candidate at Eleusis, purifying himself, before entering into the mysterious temple, by washing his hands in holy water, was admonished to present himself with a mind pure and un - defiled, without which the external cleanhiiiess of the body would by no means be accepted. Such only is thc sense of our Baptism. For Masonry is no religion, nor does it assume to take the place of any religion, but only to inculcate those principles of pure morality which Reason reads on the pages of the great Book of Nature, and to teach those great primary truths on which all religions repose. What edifice of faith and creed each brother builds upon that foundation we have no right to incluire, and therefore do not seek to inquire. It is enough for us to know that each believes in the existence of a Supreme Intellect, Crea - tor and Preserver of all things, a Deity of’ infinite tenderness, pity, and love; and that we are not mere successive phenomena, proceeding from combination and organization, but living souls, distinct from matter, and destined to survive after our bodies are dissolved. To one who did not thus believe, our symbols would have no meaning. We therefore venture to hope that, in the simple ceremonial about to l)e performed, you may be interested, and perhaps may"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"CEIIEMONY OF BAPTISM. 559 oven hear somewhat that may lead to profitable reflection, that fruitful mother of wise and upright action.

One of the fathers, answering for all, makes such response as he deems appropriate; or he may use the following at his option: Pat Iset’. Worshipful Master, the fathers and mothers of these children ask me to say, in their names, that it is because they so profoundly feel the immense responsibility which God has im - posed upon them in intrusting to them the education of these young immortals, and because of their intense desire well and faithfully to perform that duty, that they have been willing to place them under the protection of this Lodge, in the hope of insuring to them that purity of heart, and stainlessness of soul, which are synibolized by Masonic Baptism. Well, indeed, do these trembling, agitated mothers, and these anxious fathers, know how numerous and how dangerous are the snares and pitfalls which youth must encounter in the intricate paths of life. They know that very shortly some of these little ones may be left fatherless and motherless, helpless as young birds with bro - ken wings that trail upon the earth; and they feel that they can pass away more contentedly if they know that over their orphans will be extended the care and affection of this Lodge, to ward off destitution and the enemies that will be eager to assail their inno - cence and virtue. These fathers arc prepared gladly to renew their obligations. What occasion more appropriate than this, upon which you are faithfully fulfilling yours?

The arrows of the insatiable archer passing us continually, smite the bosoms of our friends and brethren, teaching us the impressive lesson constantly repeated, yet soon forgotten, that every one of us must before long yield up his body to be the inheritance of worms, in a house of darkness and dishonor. Death and the dead are ever with us, teaching us the uncertainty and brevity of life, and the instability of human fortune, and demanding of us the performance of the last sad offices of charity and brother - hood.

We can wait God’s good time for that. Somewhere in this great uni - verse we shall find our brothers and our lost ones, and be with them evermore. The Mason believes that there is that within us which shall never die; that the soul is essentially immortal, and Immortally blessed; that one law alone shall govern God’s whole universe, and that law the law of Love. To magnify this law of brotherly love, Masonry opens wide it~ portals, and invites to enter there, and live in peace and harmony, every man, of whatever nation or tube, who will lead a truly virtuous and moral life, love his brethren, minister to the sick and distressed, and believe in the one All-powerful, All-wise, every - where-present God, Architect, Creator, and Preserver of all things, by whose universal law of harmony ever rolls on this universe, the great, vast, infinite circle of successive death and"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"CEREMONIAL FOR A LODGE OF SORROW. 591 afe; to whose ineffable name let all true Masons pay profoundest homage; for whose thousand blessings poured upon us, let u~ feel the sincerest gratitude, now, henceforth, and forever.

The Judaic year is luni-solar; being governed in its length as nearly as possible by the time taken by the earth in its revolution round the sun, and in its division into lunar months, which accord as well as they can with the time that the moon rcquircs in passing around the earth. A lunation occupies about 29 days, 12 hours, and 44 minutes; therefore, as each day and consequently each month commences and terminates at midnight, some months must have 29 days only, and others 80 days. And again; as twelve lunar months do not fill the whole space of time of a solar year by about eleven days, some years must have thirteen months. The Jews commenced the year at two different periods. The ecclesiastical year began in the month Kisan, on or immediately after the new moon following the vernal equinox, and regulated the time of their religious fasis and festivals; the civil year began in the month Tisri, as near as possible to the occui~ence of the new moon after the autumnal equinox, and was used in all their civil, legal, and historical matters, and is the year used in the calcndar adopted by ineffable Freemasons. The intercallary month Veadar (second Adar~ occurs only in years having thirteen months. Owing to the difference in the length of some of the months (Marchesvan, Cliisleu, and Elul), a year of twelve months may contain 353, 354, or 355 days; and a year of thirteen months, 383, 384, or 385 days. To find the Jewish year corresponding with a given year of our Lord, add 3760 to the portion of the ycar preceding the first ilay of the. month Tisri, and 3761 to the remainder of the ye~.r~"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"ERBEEW OALE~DA& 605 In a cycle of nineteen years, the 3d, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th have thirteen months, and the remaining twelve have twelve months each.
