Without them it could not have been done. First, I would like to thank Sir Knight James McC. Allen. for many years the Grand Scribe for The Irish Councils and now the Deputy Great Chief of Knight Masons in Ireland and, in this year of 1976, the Master of the Research Lodge of Ireland, the CC” of Dublin. Next, my friend, cousin and Sir Knight J. Edward Allen. POM, KYCH with four quadrants and a Past Provincial Grand Superintendent of the Southern Section of the Knight Masons and also one of the original founders of the movement within the United States. The use of his letters, memories and books from his Library, his writings in various magazines on the subject of his visits to Ireland and the original movement here in North Carolina, and his human interest stories of the people involved were a great contribution. Sir Knight and Cousin Ray Shute, also one of the founders, who advised me that most of his letters, etc., were at the Universily of North Carolina now and that his memory had faded on many things, but still appreciated my effort tq get all of this down on paper. I am especially grateful for the help given so freely by our new Grand Scribe, Sir Knight Ray Scarborough of Delaware who so gladly helped by sending me copies of letters and records he had found and read in the material turned over to him last year. Sir Knight Landis Randall sent a pamphlet and Harold Voorhis sent a bit from Gould’s Encyclopedia. Also to Chief, Sir Knight Eddie P. Stiles for help in many ways. I also used the great 1923 edition of the “Proceedings of the Lodge of Research in Dublin”, namely the “CC” Lodge, the Iowa Masonic Library. Coil’s and Gould’s Encyclopedias and booklets of proceedings or reports from our own provincial and later Grand Council of Knight Masons of the United States for the years 1937, 1962 and 1967. The Short Sketch of the History of the Degrees by J. H. Hamill was of great help, and I expect the mosi Page 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"exact, for by every standard Bro. Hamill was a great and successful man and Mason of Dublin, Ireland. I also had copies of original Rolls of the first three lodges and a report of the craft from us inception as an independent order in 1923 to 1948 from Ireland. The result is a paper that is as nearly correct as a person can get at this time. It will be improved as more information flows in, as ii continues to do. All material has been substantiated, double checked and used with no guess work. Nevertheless, as Cousin James McC. Allen remarked: The early Irish did not write much and this is ancient Masonry from the beginning and it cannot be proved by records found to date. These degrees are older than the three degrees of the Blue Lodge and older than the Holy Royal Arch itself. There were two major problems that kept the early records unwritten, short, and some times destroyed in Ireland. The Crown and the Church from time to time took a dim view of any forms of Masonry and no scribes wanted too many names and other information around to be found. Also there were few men other than the Clergy that could write. It is interesting to note that in “The Genuine Secrets in Freemasonry” dating from before AD 1717, F. de P. Castells puts up a good argument that the Royal Arch indeed is older than the first two degrees of Masonry, certainly older than the third degree. I will insert here a fact. The little pieces of the older works did not start falling into place until about 1975 on my 5’s’ and 6~ visit to The Irish Grand Lodge, 17 Molesworth St., Dublin, Ireland. At that time, Cousin Allen took me into his confidence and accepted my seriousness, saying, “You are the only bloke who has come to see us from the States, in forty years and I think some of this information should be handed over to you. He then took me to the actual Lodge of Knight Masons, and their small office. Even though I thought I had been all over the Lodge Building I had never seen this part. We spent the entire day going over records and proceedings. At 80 plus years he is a really great person. Page 8 To sta the formatic Allen was fi older than I Ireland).

(Bro Allen was firmly of the opinion that Knight Masonry was as old or older than the Royal Arch and perhaps the first of all lodges in Ireland). History says these degrees, “so called higher degrees,” belonged to the Masters. The first mention of the Royal Arch in Ireland was in a report in an old minute book: “Two Masons carried the Royal Arch in a parade in Yougal, Ireland on St. John’s Day in 1743.” The lodges at this time were very small and very poor—but deeply rooted in tradition. It is felt by many students of the Craft that the Masonic degrees, especially the speculative or so-called higher degrees, could have spread back into Europe as the “Dark Ages” were ending like most learning did. At that time, Knight Masonry required two sets of Officers based on the Bible stories of Joshua and Zerubbabel, the Red and Green degrees. We know this from old records, and there exists an old apron of the degrees with green on one side and red on the other. Records go back before 1750 on this. Other documents shed more light on this period. A certificate, in French, (but good evidence proves it was translated from English), testifies that de Cluzeau was a Master Mason from “Loge Bleuc de Dublin #26.” Tweniy years later proceedings of Irish Lodge #535 granted a demit to a member Mason, Isaac Reed, residing in New York. This man was made a Super Excellent Master on August 20,1773 and on August 23~ was dubbed a Knight of the Red Cross. In 1784, Archibald Wildin received a “GREEN” certificate and by the end of the ceniuiy the Green Degrees were all over Ireland. In 1836, The Grand Council of Rites in Ireland (comprised of duly qualified and elected representatives) si~ggested a Grand Council of Knights of the Sword, but the motion failed. The constitution of that body printed in the Ahimen Rezon of 1839 reads, “The Supreme Encampment of Knights Templar and the Knights of Malta and to the councils of the preceding degrees of the Knights of theSwordor’RedCross’ Masons....” Between 1790and 1836,(or perhaps even earlier, for no actual records have been found), the “Green” degrees became separated from the Royal Arch.

They formed the Lodge #666 that became the Research Lodge of North Carolina - the first research lodge in the United States. (This is a story all its own and although much of it is in the “Innovators” much is left to tell. With only three members of the first rolls of Knight Masons and only a few of the members of #666 still living, this should be undertaken at once.) We know from the information found on the organization of the Knight Masons that at first the men in North Carolina were primarily interested in the Degree of Royal Ark Mariner. We know they received the work of AMD from Scotland and Lord Cassilis who visited here in 1931. 1 understand, but cannot prove as yet, that he conveyed these degrees of AMD on about 20 Masons in Asheville that summer of 1931, but more research on that is needed and cannot be used in this paper. At any rate in the hurry to incorporate the AMD degrees in North Carolina, in some manner the Scottish Council of Knight Masons of Ireland was left out. This mistake became known almost at once and work was begun to secure the degrees from their proper home in Ireland, the Mother Council. This took time, money, and patience, for the Irish were not about to let their sovereignty be abridged or go floating around without proper warrants and seriousness. They desired to have no problems with the AMD, Ancient and Accepted Rites in the British Isles and with the Scottish and York Rite (Templars) in the United States. So at this time Brothers Ed Allen, Ray Shute and Fred Bahnson really began to work. Many letters, some of which are included in this paper, went back and forth, many uncertainties had to be worked out. It was decided that the best man to go to Ireland was I. Edward Allen of Warrenton. The story Gf his trip was written by him for the Orphan’s Friend, the official publication of North Carolina Grand Lodge in the issue of September 16, 1935. While in Dublin, Ireland, Brother Allen was the guest of two great Knight Masons, the Hamell brothers, bankers. While there, the Green degrees were conferred on Brother Allen, making him the first (if you overlook the AMD receivers at Asheville) in the United States. Brother Allen suggested that they return his trip and be the guests Page 12 of the distinl in North Ca been the cus the investun Many i• Ireland.

There was no trouble, really, in getting the permission and rsof#666 releases from Scotiand and England, although it had to be shown that the “Green Degrees” were not like the degrees in the Ancient ~zation of and Accepted Rite and the Knights Templar. But in dealing with lina were our country things did not go so easily. It took the wise counseling We know of Brother Ed Allen to really get it on the right road. His suggestion d Cassilis was to go ahead with the warrants without a total commitment from is yet, that the Grand Encampment and others. They just did not want to lay Asheville themselves open for problems in the future and therefore even though md cannot they had no serious objections, they would not put this in writing porate the This was the breakthrough. Ireland invited the leaders to come Scottish to Ireland and receive the Warrants. But this being depression time, few could or would raise the money. So, in a compromise, the men work was in North Carolina invited the men of Dublin to come to North eland, the Carolina and Brother Bahnson suggested that we in North Carolina r the Insh raise what we could to help defray the expenses of the Irish Brothers o floating in their trip. The Irishmen also wanted to visit Canada, but at any desired to rate they did come to America. A letter from Sir Knight James d Rites in McC.

The Councils were warranted on May 20, 1936 and Constituted on September 14, 1937. Copies of the original Irish rolls are attached. During this period, many letters were sent back and forth, even asking if the twenty one men applying for the Knight Masons degrees in three councils would be excused from dues, etc. having taken the degrees under the Scottish AMD umbrella before. It appears to me from conversation with James McC. Allen, of Dublin, that the early Shute letters displayed a great deal more interest in the Ark Mariners Degree than the Knight Masons. One letter at this time advises Shute to have twenty of the men that took the AMD apply for Councils in North Carolina and to certify that these “Green” degrees were in no way a duplication of any degrees in the York or Scottish Rite but were different and distinct, sending proper forms to be filled out and returned. On October 30, 1934, Brother Shute’s cover letter shows that he had heeded all requests and was submitting names for three councils, still keeping their Scottish names: Saint Patrick in America #26 on the Irish rolls, Shamrock Thistle and Rose #27 to be in Raleigh, and Harp. Cross and Eagle #28 to be in Warrenton, North Carolina. It had been decided for a number of reasons that all three councils were to be in North Carolina instead of one being in Virginia. At the same time an application of a Provincial Grand Council was made and the officers were suggested. In February 1935 the Grand Scribeof Ireland wrote to England AMD and A & C Rites and the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar here in the United States. This has partly been explained earlier, but now the Irish were really serious and wanted answers. It was here that I. Edward Allen stepped in and wrote the letters we have mentioned before and got the problems solved so the track could be opened again. But letters still went back and forth, even rituals were exchanged, and finally on May 25, 1936, 1. H. Hamell, writing officially from Dublin, authorized the three councils but held up on the Grand Provincial Council until later. At that time he asked that the designated Excellent Chiefs of each Council to come to Dublin to be installed and the councils be constituted.
