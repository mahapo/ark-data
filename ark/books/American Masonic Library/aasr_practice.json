The background statements for the chapters on the Feast of Tishri and Maundy Thursday, in particular, are in the eloquent style of Brother Clausen, and their subject matter must be most informative to our membership. Both chapters, together with the Ring Ceremony and the Cere - mony of Joint Installation, provide opportunities to pre - sent the Scottish Rite to Masons and non-Masons alike in a pleasing and effective manner, and their use in practice will inspire a growth in membership. The introductory material is especially helpful and will do much to bring into uniformity our decorum in dress, on feast days, and in receiving visitors in our Bodies. Useful suggestions are given for the conferring of the degrees and careful attention to them will expedite the conferral and enhance its beauty. It makes for convenience, also, to have under one cover the ritual for the Scottish Rite Funeral Service. A thoughtful study of the volume will clarify and cor - rect many procedures which Officers of the Bodies may xiv have neglected and will bring to attention, perhaps for the first time, others never adopted in practice. The Glossary will give assurance to ritualists who seek to do their work to perfection. Officers and the workers in the Rite will welcome this effort of the Grand Commander. It is a work in which he may well take great pride and in which we shall surely find inspiration.

It should, therefore, be treated with dignity and record - ed with accuracy. The official, full name of this Supreme Council is: “The Supreme Council (Mother Council of the World) of the Inspectors General Knights Commanders of the House of the Temple of Solomon of the Thirty-third Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Free N4asonry of the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States of America.” 1"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Location of The Supreme Council The Supreme Council was organized on May 31, 1801, in the city of Charleston, State of South Caro - lina. It is appropriate, therefore, that this birthplace should be the historic location of what is called the See of The Supreme Council. The Executive and Administrative Offices of The Supreme Council, however, are located in the magnificent structure called the House of the Temple in our Nation’s r Capital, Washington, D.C. To be authentic, all Decrees, Balustres, Charters, Diplomas, and other official documents must be issued from the House of the Temple. Location of Subordinate Bodies To assure proper form and attribution, all Subordi - nate Bodies will date and designate their official pro - grams, announcements and signatures from its loca - tion called a Valley, in its city and Orient, including the title.

The presiding officer introduces Visitors and notes appropriate Masonic titles and honors. [See Intro - duction of Visitors.] 2. Reading of the minutes—the Secretary presents to the assemblage the records of the previous session or sessions, as yet unread and unsigned. They are read and approval requested. Accuracy is required; there - fore, soon after the close of the previous session at which the minutes were taken, the Secretary must always read over his rough draft and correct any possible errors or omissions, thus assuring an accu - rate formal record. 3. Almoner’s rep6rt—the Almoner reports on philan - thropy and indicates any special case requiring relief or assistance. 4. Reports—chairmen of permanent committees pre - sent current reports. 5. Reports—chairmen of special committees supply relevant reports. 6. Petitions—the Body receives petitions for reception and admission to membership. 7. Balloting—the Brethren cast ballots on petitions or propositions. 8. Brethren make appropriate motions, and offer reso - lutions. 4 Introduction of Visitors Scottish Rite protocol requires that “every principal Body of the Rite,” i.e., those having a distinct constitu - tional existence, must keep a Visitor Register in its ante - room. All Visitors will record their names, titles or other pertinent information in this book. All honors are reserved for accomplishments within the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and are not paid under any circumstance to anyone because of a dignity or office dependent on achievement outside the Rite, except to the Grand Master of Masons of the State. A Brother must wear his cap and may wear his chain, cordon and jewel to receive such honors. The Grand Master is received with 8 lights, 8 swords, and under an arch of steel. The Grand Crosses of the Court of Honour, the Dep - uties the Grand Commander commissions, and all Inspec - tors General Honorary of the Thirty-third Degree, other than those hereinafter mentioned, are received with 8 lights, 8 swords, and under an arch of steel. All Sovereign Grand Inspectors General and Emeriti Members or Special Representatives of the Mother Supreme Council, and Active Members and Represen - tatives of other Supreme Councils in Amity with that for this Jurisdiction, will receive a formal salutation of 9 lights and 9 swords under an arch of steel with swords clashing and mallets beating.

Refections During the celebration of Scottish Rite Feast Days, ban - quets or other formal fraternal repasts are known as ~‘Refections.” They must be observed with all dignity and proper ceremony. The table ought to be set in one of the following established patterns: 4. To the Grand Lodge and Grand Master of Masons of the Jurisdiction. 5. To the Sovereign Grand Inspector General of the Orient or Deputy, by name. 6. To other Grand Bodies of the Jurisdiction. 7. To the memory of all Brethren of the degree who have passed from this realm of earthly labor during the present Masonic year. 8. To all Masons and Masonic Bodies, of all Rites and degrees, across the lands and oceans of the world; acclaim to the worthy; restoration to the ill; help to the needy; and succor to the oppressed of all nations. TR CG MC OR SW L/M El scc AE JW E AL Fig. 2 Fig. 1 Fig. 3 Toasts of Obligation are central to the Rite’s Refections and may never be omitted. They are sacramental, of sacred character and are symbolic of the solemn Obliga - tions that bind us to the Rite. Also, the Toasts of Obliga - tion, reflecting the order of the Rite, must be offered and executed in this sequence: 1. To the Government of the Country. 2. To The Supreme Council. 3. To the Sovereign Grand Commander, by name. b If there are visiting Brethren or guests, they are toasted as such, but only after the sixth Toast of Obligation. If any special toast is presented, as peculiar to the particular degree in which the Refection is had, it is given after the fourth Toast of Obligation. The exact manner of drinking the toast and the estab - lished drinking acclamation are followed as defined in each degree. It is required that all Toasts of Obligation be given and shared standing. Caps The cap is considered as a part of the uniform and is treated as such. Consequently, it must not be removed when the flag is passing, while saying the Pledge of Allegiance, or participating in a prayer. On such occasions as the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance or the per- 7 I.."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"formance of the national anthem in song or music, the cap remains on the head, and the Scottish Rite Mason places his right hand on his heart. When praying, the cap remains in place, but the head is slightly bowed and the hands are placed in the “Sign of the Good Shepherd”: the left arm folded over the right with fingers outstretched and touching the shoulders comfortably. This dignified posi - tion reflects the compassionate spirit of the Scottish Rite in recalling the Good Shepherd as he carried a lamb over his neck, holding its feet with his crossed hands. The Altar The central focus of all significant ceremonies and f or - ma 1 degrees in the Scottish Rite is the altar. It must be prepared and arranged with meticulous care. For monthly meetings, the appropriate instructions of the Fourteenth Degree, the Eighteenth Degree, the Thirtieth Degree or the Thirty-second Degree must be followed. Consult the indi - vidual degrees for exact details. For Reunions, the altar is arranged according to the specific direction of each degree in presentation. Refer to “Rituals” for relevant information. Visiting Bodies in Other Jurisdictions The Great Book speaks of “the right hands of fellow - ship.” [Galatians 2: 9] In the Scottish Rite, this fraternal grasp and the bond of friendship and Brotherhood it sym - bolizes should be shared as often as possible. Whether on trips of pleasure or business, members of the Rite are encouraged to witness the work of other Valleys. Admis - sion does not require examination. To gain entrance, it is sufficient for a visiting member to present a current dues card or, in some instances, to display his Membership Patent or Certificate. Attending Meetings and Reunions In the Mother Jurisdiction To assure that only actual members in good standing participate in the work of any Body in the Mother Jurisdic - tion, each Brother must carry in his possession a current membership card and be willing to present it on demand. If so desired, he may also be required to exhibit a regular Patent or Diploma of the Highest Degree conferred in that Body that The Supreme Council has issued. Only upon such certification as the above may a member be permitted to attend the Body in which he holds membership or visit any other Body of the Rite in the Mother Jurisdiction. I I S 9"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO Degrees Communication Text My text, Clausen’s Commentaries on Morals and Dog - ma, provides in a brief style cogent explanations of the degrees. When for good reason it is not possible to exem - plify a degree in full form and the exemplication of which is not mandatory, the appropriate section from this work must be used because the Mother Supreme Council has adopted this as the Official and required form of Com - munication, under these circumstances. Conferral Lectures The wisdom of the Rite is timeless. It should not be sub - jected to personal opinions or interpretations. When con - ferring or communicating the degrees, remain faithful to those lectures PROVIDED and ADOPTED. Under special cir - cumstances, the lectures may be abbreviated substantially or omitted entirely, but never substitute any other lecture for the authorized and accepted version. A darkened Lodge room often is conducive to an effec - tive lecture, and in some cases the degree may suggest a low level of lighting. Do not, however, plunge the room into total darkness. This is an inconvenience to many, a safety hazard, contrary to the intent of the degree direc - tions and in contrast to the Craft’s faith in the immortality and invincibility of light.

To foster this spirit of unity, the Supreme Councils of England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, The Netherlands, the Northern N4asonic Jurisdiction, Canada, and the Mother Jurisdic - tion have approved the following Equation of Degrees with the National Grand Lodges of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland practicing the Rites that include the Scottish Rite.

It establishes mood, touches the heart and elevates the mind. Control, how - ever, is crucial. Music must assist, not hinder, the degree as a whole. Keep selections short, appropriate and com - plementary. Never overdo musical accompaniment so that it drowns out the degree’s message. Music is always sec - ondary to the lesson symbolized in the degree. In fact, several degrees require no music at all. It must be remem - bered music during a dialogue is always inappropriate in those that benefit from musical enrichment. According to our Statutes: When a Body is opened in its highest degree all its degrees are opened and it may pass from work in one degree to work in another without other form than the declaration that it does so. Proposition for Degrees Order is the hallmark of The Grand Architect of the Universe, and it is central to the Scottish Rite. From a can - didate’s first tentative steps on the path of Freemasonry, set forms must be recognized and followed. The “Proposi - tion for Degrees” as described in the Statutes (1979, Article XVII, Section 7) of The Supreme Council clearly states: “Any qualified person residing within the territorial Jurisdiction of a Body may be proposed at any stated meeting thereof by propositioning in writing, signed by one member and seconded by another, also in writing. Such proposition may be made without the knowledge of the person proposed. A Body may, by its By-laws, require candidates to apply for Degrees by petition in writing.” Once a “proposed Brother” is accepted, he is informed of this fact and invited to file a regular petition. If he is rejected, the matter is closed, and no one is notified. An adherence to the following rules applying to “proposi - tions” assures correct handling of this initial and all- important portion of a Masonic career. 1. Propose only Master Masons personally known to you as worthy of Scottish Rite membership. Sign your name as “proposer” and have a mutual Scottish Rite Brother sign as “seconder.” 2. Give the “proposition” to your Secretary who will notify the candidate, if his election has been suc - 1< 12 13"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"cessful. Preferably, such notification is presented to the- candidate in a formal, attractive certificate of election. This custom, plus special delivery handling, impresses the candidate with the importance of his acceptance in the Rite. 3. A siK-month period of petition allows the candidate to inform himself about the Scottish Rite and to con - sider the significance of his joining the Rite. If he petitions for membership, he is asked to designate the member who most influenced his decision. 4. Should unusual circumstances arise, a second ballot may be required. 5. During the six-month period following the original proposition, no second proposition for the same can - didate may be considered, except as noted in No. 4. A copy of the “Proposition for Degrees” facing this page is furnished for your convenience. Publication of Names of Petitioners f or Degrees While not a “secret” organization in any invidious sense of the word, the Scottish Rite must sustain a considered selectivity and confidentiality regarding certain aspects of its beneficial work. On a personal level, this is of especial importance regarding petitioners where a rejection of the Rite might act detrimentally on the individual’s personal life and community status. Under absolutely no circum - stances may any Subordinate Body of the Mother Supreme Council—its officers or other members— publish, circulate or in any other printed or written form make available to the members of that Body or to anyone else, a list of the names of petitioners for the degrees or affiliation.

Ritualistic Illustrations The sublime message of Freemasonry is preserved for all ages in the symbolic beauty of our Scottish Rite degrees. The complex meeting of rituals, rubrics, costumes, scen - ery, properties, forms and ceremonies conveys an inef - fable meaning to the heart and mind of the prepared Mason. These are not matters for general knowledge. [t is, therefore, strictly forbidden to print, publish or in any other manner duplicate and make known any aspect of the conferring of the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of the Mother Jurisdiction except as The Supreme Council or Grand Commander may have autho - rized. No program or other publication can extract, explain, summarize or present any part of the degrees anywhere at anytime except in a tiled meeting or for the purpose of communication or rehearsal. The famous American poet, Emily Dickinson, said: “Publication is the auction of the mind of man.” No member except as authorized, may “auction” any element of our great Masonic heritage epitomized in the degrees before the unenlightened or unentitled. Sequence As steel first is tempered with heat and then cold, so sequence must be observed in the creation of the Scottish Rite Freemason. All degrees must be conferred in proper succession. To process steel incorrectly yields a brittle, weak metal. Similarly, breaking the established order of the degrees reduces their effective pattern and hinders the initiate’s attainment of light. Never, for example, present a degree out of order, say the Twenty-sixth during the day and the Twenty-first at night, nor combine two or more degrees into one, such as the Ninth and Tenth or the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh as one degree. Centuries of Masonic development have resulted in the present order and form of the Scottish Pite degrees. To tinker or tamper with this precious heritage is to threaten the essence of our beloved Rite. Signs, Tokens, Words, and Paraphernalia The aim of each degree is enlightenment. That which aids this goal is acceptable; what detracts from it should be avoided. Thus it is permitted to delete the explanation of certain signs, passwords, batteries, aprons and cordons or collars in some degrees (except the Fourth, Fourteenth, Eighteenth, Thirtieth and Thirty-second) when such ommission assists the overall impact of the work on the Brethren. In some cases, full explanation enhances the degree and should be retained. In any degree it is not required that the apron, cordon or collar actually be put on the candidate. Holding them up so that all may see is sufficient. Here, as always, symbolic importance is pre - dominant, and traditionally some slight variation from the degrees, as in the cases of the specific items above, is allowed in order to accent the message of the ceremony. The Fourteenth Degree Ring Purity of Honor, integrity of the Sword, spotlessness of the Shield—these were the three highest ideals of our ancient brethren. “Honor that never broke the faith with any one” was supreme and preserved despite danger or personal loss. ~iIntegrity of the Sword in never failing to draw it in defense of innocent and right” was a duty embraced with fervor and acted upon with courage. “The Shield never to be sullied by protecting oppression and 16 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"wrong” was the symbol of each brother’s dedication to the knighthood. When the ancient knight passed to his eternal home, he bequeathed his Honor, Sword and Shield to another, one near and dear, one he knew would carry on his quest unblemished and victorious. The Scottish Rite Fourteenth Degree Ring symbolizes these ancient emblems. Eloquently simple, it is a flat, plain band of gold or other material resembling gold, and embosed thereon an engraved or enameled plate in the form of an equilateral triangle and within the triangle the Hebrew letter “Yod.” In it there is inscribed the Scottish Rite Motto: Virtus Jun xit, Mors No~’z Separabit (Virtue has united and death shall not separate). The ring’s circle expresses the fraternal bond between all men and all gen - erations. On its owner’s death, it should be given with dignity and pride to another Scottish Rite Mason so he can carry on a similar Masonic Honor, Sword and Shield that the ring symbolizes. Although the ring may be altered to fit the new Brother’s finger, it need not be changed. There is no off i - cial instruction designating on what finger it should be worn. The position is frrelevant so long as the ring is worn with honor appropriate to the fallen Brother, his fraternal heir, and the Rite. As an evidence of authenticity, the wearing of the Scottish Pite ring is mandatory under our rituals, vows, laws, regulations and customs. See Chapter Nine, page 81, hereinafter, for further sug - gestions. To draw attention to the importance of the ring, a number of Valleys have elicited enthusiasm among the Brethren and open general family attendance with a com - bined ring and cap presentation.

That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.” ‘Moses” by Michelangelo Photography by H Armstrong Roberts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 46 [II Etrog, “Descendant of the High Priest” Isider Kaufman Keter Publishing House, Ltd"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Why the Feast of Tishri? The oi~igins and significances of the Feast of Tishri make it the most Scottish Rite of festivals. No other occasion epitomizes the character and purpose of the Rite more wholly than this historic celebration of the dedication of King Solomon’s Temple. To marshal the meanings of the feast is to summarize the principle ideals and traditions of our Fraternity. First of all, we observe the Feast of Tishri because it is an age-old custom which now has the power of law. Under the Stcitutes of The Supreme Council, the feast is “obligatory,” a sacramental sharing of our fraternal spirit. Freemasons have always revered order since we recognize that there is a Supreme Order that structures all creation. Masonic Law reflects this divine order, and we serve the purposes of The Great Architect of the Universe when we observe this vow of obedience to the Rite. Secondly, the rich legendry of the Temple’s dedication which is celebrated in the Feast of Tishri is an essential part of the Fourteenth Degree. The symbolic details of the Temple’s position, design, construction, furnishing and decoration carry intense meaning as they apply to the spiritual temple of Freemasonry built in the soul of every Brother. Through the symbols of the Temple we gain enlightenment and we recommit ourselves to building Freemasonry ‘‘in the hearts of men and among nations.’’ Significantly, a king of peace and wisdom built the Temple. The Lord forbade David, a warrior and a man of blood, to construct the Temple and, instead, delivered this responsibility and glory to Solomon whose very name means peace. Thus in observing the Feast of Tishri we reaffirm our dedication to human concord and the brotherhood of all men in a world of peace. As individuals and as Brothers in the Rite we resolve to build, as Solomon did, through harmony and cooperation, ever seeking peace for all mankind. The consecration of the Temple must also be observed at the Feast of Tishri, because it teaches the equality and unity of all members of the Rite. The people of Israel, unified under Solomon, were equal in their devotion to the King Solomon’s Temple—Beale Photography by H Armstrong Roberts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 48 49"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Lord and equal in their sovereignty to all other nations. In the Feast of Tishri, all Perfect Elus and those of higher degrees can join at the banquet table and share the bond of fraternal unity. Yet another reason to keep the Feast of Tishri is that such observance fosters the warm spirit of fraternal fellowship so vital to our Rite. We meet at a common table, express our mutual esteem and so promote that essential bond of cordiality and respect which lightens and shares the weight of our Masonic endeavors. Such social amenities open us to each other in an atmosphere elevated beyond the sphere of normal, day-to-day communication. Within the context of the Feast of Tishri we realize more deeply than ever before the value of our fellow man, with - out which the individual is lost in a self-imposed prison of human isolation. Lastly, the law, legendry, peace, equality, unity and fellowship of the Feast of Tishri combine to make this the Masonic feast of feasts. At the Refection Table all men— Jew, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist and others—join in a common voice of thanksgiving to God. The Feast of Tishri is a Masonic feast of thanksgiving where every man can share his gratitude and express his sincere thanks to Him who made all things. The Deity has given us life, the strength to live it fully, and the joy of sharing the beauty and goodness of His creation with our fellow man. Most of all, He has given us freedom. The Feast of Tishri celebrates this freedom the Israelites won with the guidance of providence, despite the shackles of Egypt and the armies of the Philistines. 50 This ancient victory celebrated in the dedication of Solomon’s Temple is kept forever fresh through our keep - ing of the Feast of Tishri. It promises to all men that the burdens of tyranny are temporary, that the darkness will yield to light, that knowledge will conquer ignorance, and that the Creator intended men to be free. The message of Tishri comes to us strongly and clearly from across the ages because it has been so preserved in the symbolism and allegory of the Scottish Rite. Through our observance of this great feast of thanksgiving we, as heirs of Solomon, perpetuate his magnificent Temple of freedom in our lives, our communities, our Country and, most of all, in our beloved Rite. Conducting the Feast Pcirt One The celebration of the Feast of Tishri will be observed by the Lodges of Perfection on the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Tishri. It will be divided into two parts: the con - duct of the Lodge, with a following feast of celebration and its appropriate ceremonies. Except for the “Toasts of Obligation’ given during the feast, the following suggestions for planning and sharing the feast are not sacramental. They may be varied as fits the needs of the individual Lodge of Perfection. A proper flexibility of the celebration allows the maximum benefit for the Brethren while sustaining the core of tradition and form inherent in the observation of this great Masonic feast day. As a pattern which has proved its worth, the following guide holds great value for the Lodges of Perfec - tion and for our entire Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. 51 ii:"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"I A&cording to its established custom, the Fraternity of Perfect Elus will meet in its usual place of assembly. Then the Officers or Brethren so designated will “Open” the Lodge in full or short form. If possible, the full form should be used. Often a large number of Valleys in the Mother Jurisdiction confer the degrees at Reunions or Convocations. Time seldom permits the full form of the “Opening” and “Closing” ceremonies of the Lodge of Perfection, and many Brethren have never heard the inspired lessons and eloquent words of these sections. II After the Lodge has been “opened,” the Venerable Master, the Secretary or some other Brother who has been selected for the honor will read the message of your Sovereign Grand Commander stated previously, “Why the Feast of Tishri.” (Page 48.) III Following the reading of the Grand Commander’s Message, a Brother respected for his eloquence and clarity will read aloud the Obligation of the Fourteenth Degree of the Scottish Rite so that all the Brethren can hear and respond again to the responsibilities they have gladly accepted as Brethren of the Mystic Tie. IV The Brethren will then join in prayer requesting guid - 52 ance and inspiration befitting this great feast day. The following prayer would be appropriate: “Sovereign Author of the Universe, we pay unto you the sincere homage of our fervent gratitude for all the blessings which Thy infinite goodness has bestowed upon us. We beseech Thee to purify our hearts in the sacred fire of Thy love, and to guide and direct us in the ways of virtue. Let Peace and Charity form the chain of our union; cause us in this Lodge faintly to imitate the condition of the Elect in Thy Holy and Spiritual Kingdom; enable us in all things to discern and adopt the good and reject the evil; let not pretended zeal and devotion deceive us, nor let us deceive ourselves as to our weaknesses and errors; aid us in advancing the purposes and attaining the objects of the true and genuine Masonry; and thus enable us to serve our fellows and assist in carrying forward Thy great designs. So mote it be. Amen.” V The Lodge will then be “closed” in full or short form. VI After the Lodge of Perfection has been officially “closed,” the Brethren will join their guests at the ban - quet hall and enjoy the feast. Part Two The essential element in any Masonic refection is fellowship, not food. Therefore the table set to celebrate 53"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the Feast of Tishri may be as simple or as splendidly laden as the good judgment of the Brethren decides. Whether a simple fraternal breaking of bread or the sharing of a sumptuous banquet, the dinner will be cause of rejoicing because it recalls to us the great day when Solomon’s Tem - ple was dedicated and the Rite began its illustrious history. I The only absolutely required elements of the celebra - tion of the Feast of Tishri are the “Toasts of Obligation.” The ritual of the degrees of the Lodge of Perfection states they are “sacramental and can never be omitted.” Traditional in wording and sequence, these toasts must be given in order and with great dignity. “All the Toasts of Obligation are drunk standing.” The table for the refe.ction of the Lodge, as prescribed in the ritual, should have a traditional form, either horseshoe, cross or rectangle. Officers, similarly, will assume table positions assigned to them in the ritual. The “Toasts of Obligation” are set forth on page 6. II A very desirable aspect of the Feast of Tishri is the inclusion of various special features between the Toasts of Obligation. Appropriate vocal or musical selections can add much to the atmosphere of the occasion. Also, a short theatrical presentation or scenic representation of a Masonic or patriotic nature can provide a dramatic accent. A short inspirational address by a selected speaker will give fresh perspectives to the feast day. Ideally, a combination of these or other elements the individual Brethren of the Lodge of Perfection devise can make the celebration of the Feast of Tishri the most memorable Masonic event of the year. Joy and celebration are the keynotes of this feast. Everything must be aimed at sustaining this spirit; there - fore, the program must never be long or tiresome. Per - formers and speakers should be chosen as much for their brevity as for their musical, dramatic or rhetorical excellence. Very definite and short time limits especially must be applied to all participants, and to those who respond to toasts, if such responses are permitted at all. The overall planning and conduct of We festival of Tishri are left to the discretion of the individual Lodges of Perfection and their Brethren. The above outline offers suggestions that have proved appropriate over the years in attracting new members ~o the Rite and in encouraging greater participation among present mem - bers. The details of each celebration of the Feast of Tishri are left to the good taste and skill of the Brethren in charge of the festivities. The Mystic Bond “Of a truth, men are mystically united: a mystic bond of brotherhood makes all men one.” These words of Thomas Carlyle express the essence of the Scottish Rite. In cel - ebrating the Feast of Tishri we rejoice in this bond and 54 55"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"share it across the festive ritual table. It is a time of joy, love, peace and fellowship. It is the most Masonic of feasts and should be celebrated among all Brethren of the Rite with a deep sense of gratitude for all The Great Architect of the Universe has given to us. This day of Masonic thanksgiving originated in the dedication of Solomon’s Temple, but in continuing this celebration of the Feast of Tishri our beloved Rite of Freemasonry builds another and greater Temple among men and nations—the Temple of Universal and Eternal Brotherhood. The Feast of Tishri: Symbol, Significance, Law Friedrich von Schiller, the great German poet and dramatist, observed that “a deep meaning often lies in old customs.” Many will observe the holly of Christmas, the candles of Hanukkah, the painted eggs of Easter, the fire - crackers of the Fourth of July and the stuffed turkey of Thanksgiving. The more thoughtful will see beyond these festive surfaces to the fundamental themes inherent in each observance. The treasured hope of Christmas, the deter - mined courage of Hanukkah, the confirmed faith of Easter, the true patriotism of the Fourth of July and the national gratitude of Thanksgiving—each human emotion and aspiration symbolized in these occasions is part of nature, an element in the eternal plan of The Grand Archi - tect of the Universe. Together they present a pattern of life. They outline man’s place in existence and the role he is to play in the drama of creation. While observing all the above feasts and more, the Scot - tish Rite Freemason pays special reverence to another day, long recognized in Masonic tradition and law—the Feast of Tishri. This day, above all others, speaks to the heart of every Mason and symbolizes the ancient origin and con - tinuing truth of our Rite. Surviving records indicate that the Brethren have always celebrated the Feast of Tishri with proper ceremonies. The custom did not take on the force of law, however, until 1866 when the Statutes of The Supreme Council selected the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Tishri as the official feast day of the Lodges of Perfection and as “the day of the dedication of the first Temple,” the Temple of Solomon. In 1885, a Revising Committee made the feast “obliga - tory” and set its date as December 27, but in 1886, Grand Commander Pike in his eloquent Allocution spoke directly to the issue and revealed that all sound evidence points to an earlier date for the feast. He declared that “The 15th day of Tisri [Tishri], which generally begins in September, should be the Feast Day of the Perfect Elus.” The Supreme Council immediately accepted this posi - tion and fixed the feast day of the Lodges of Perfection as “the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Tishri, the day of the dedication of the first Temple.” The laws of 1905 and later Statutes tacitly accepted this date and the Brethren gathered each fall to share in a fraternal reflection in cele - bration of that first Temple and its significance throughout Masonic history and ritual. No feast day in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry has ever had or ever will have greater significance than the Feast of Tishri. It is the symbolic cornerstone of our Rite. It forms the central theme of most of our degrees. It is the feast of feasts in Freemasonry. To understand the Feast of Tishri and its symbolic significance to the Scottish Rite, 56 57"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"4 past and present, is to touch the “deep meaning,” the very heart afid soul of our Fraternity. A Temple of Spirit and Stone The first Feast of Tishri was the culmination of one of the greatest architectural achievements man ever con - ceived or God inspired. It climaxed many long years of hard labor and was the fullfillment of the Lord’s direct command given to King David, the “Warrior King” of Israel. By the tenth century before Christ, David had sub - dued his people’s enemies. His hand held victory, but he had won triumph with the sword. The Lord God of Israel said to him: “Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. He shall build an house for my name. So it came to Solomon, whose name means peace, to build the first Hebrew Temple in Jerusalem. What a responsibility for so young a man! He ascended to the throne about 977 B.C. To him was given this great task: to sustain a nation based on peace and to build a temple founded on love. With his own hands he laid the cor - 55 nerstone. Following the visions which the Temple’s true builder, The Great Architect of the Universe, gave him, he sketched its symbolic dimensions and planned its impres - sive decorations. He set its famous pillars, Jachin and Boaz, as magnificent independent columns at the Temple’s entrance, and he saw to it that the interior was heavily overlaid with an abundance of glistening gold. Though modest in overall size, the Temple’s massive substructure, formed about a mountain, lifted it high above all the sur - rounding buildings and temples making it the focal point of ancient Jerusalem and a wonder to all who viewed it from a distance or close at hand. The Liturgy of the Fourteenth Degree says that “the Temple.. . [was] completed in the year 3,000, six years six months and ten days after King Solomon had laid the first stone.” Using the modern calendar, the date would be about 966 B.C., but the Temple stood empty for nearly a whole year because it was the will of God that the dedica - tion take place during the month of Abraham’s birth. In this way the Temple’s dedication would be a double thanksgiving, a tribute to Abraham who guided the Hebrews, a people oppressed and at war, and a tribute to Solomon who brought Israel to nationhood and peace with prosperity. His wisdom, brotherhood and love made Solomon famous throughout the ancient world, and in this first Temple these ideals were realized in living rock, fine timber and precious gold. 4’ ‘4, L Temple and faith became one. The Lord’s will was made manifest to the physical eyes of man. Today, we as Scot - tish Rite Freemasons need only recall this great Temple of Solomon to realize that the Almighty will never forsake men of good will, and that we, too, can build mighty temples of spirit and stone to the Lord. 59"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Temple’s Mystic Communication In many ways the dedication of the Temple of Solomon is a celebration of freedom. It marks the birth of Abraham whose spirit of independence sustained the tribes of Israel during their generations of bondage and suffering. King Solomon’s dedication of the Temple is also the final step in the formation of Israel for the first time as a sovereign entity, a secure and prospei~ous nation at peace among nations. Appropriately, the dedication coincided with the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles, a “most holy and solemn Feast,” Josephus the ancient historian tells us, kept by the Hebrews beginning on the 15th day of the month of Tishri. This great feast remembered the Exodus from Egypt, the land of slavery. It recalled the sojourn in the wilderness when the fleeing people lived in makeshift tents. It com - memorated the generations of wandering and struggle. It celebrated the freedom of the Promised Land. The people would go to the fields, erect tents as their ancestors had, and then decorate the tents with the fruits of autumn’s harvest. Philo of Alexandra said of the custom, “after receiving the perfection of all the fruits of the year, it is becoming to give thanks to the Being that made them perfect.” On that most memorable of days when the Temple was dedicated, what must have been the joy of the children of Israel as they gathered in Jerusalem! Solomon had called them from every part of the land. The Temple had been decorated in keeping with the solemnity of the occasion. Great numbers of musicians and singers sang of God’s glory and mercy. White-robed priests formed a grand pro- 60 4— cession. They bore on their shoulders the Ark of the Cove - nant, the Holy of Holies, the symbol of God’s providence and Israel’s salvation. With utmost reverence, the Ark was placed in the Tem - ple’s most sacred quarter, the Cubical Room. At last, in symbol and in fact, Israel was free. Coming as it did dur - ing the autumnal equinox, the dedication of King Solo - mon’s Temple and the Feast of Tishri marked the rich material and spiritual harvest brought to the people of Israel and through extension, to all men who fulfill the will of God. Solomon knew, however, that there would be future trials, a winter of testing to follow this autumn of attainment. In order to assure that the lessons of this Feast of Tishri never be forgotten, Solomon chose 25 superior Elus (Brethren) and brought them to a secret vault where he conferred on them the fruits of his wisdom. We in the Scottish Rite represent this transfer or confer - ral of hierarchic knowledge in the Degree of the Perfect Elu. Here each Brother is instructed on the construction of the perfect spiritual temple, an inner edifice of virtue and brotherhood that rivals the material splendor of the out - ward Temple. The Degree of Perfect Elu was conferred on these chosen brethren, and each shared in the wisdom of Solomon. Each pledged to live in peace and harmony with his fellow man. Each dedicated himself to be a temple builder within himself and among all men.

Our task began in the dim reaches of time, but our dedication today is as firm and our courage as strong as that of those heirs of Solomon in that magnificent Temple on that historic Feast of Tishri nearly three millenia ago. As Scottish Rite Freemasons, we are all heirs of Solomon. Let us remain worthy of this inheritance of freedom. t44’3 r~o A A4q3 A3 44’ ii, h IflWerea Voice ~1Yc L I.

They are simple words. Yet they express the most sublime truth: all men are brothers. We share one origin and one common obligation. The Great Teacher in this one manda turn no vurn, New Commandment, summarized the highest wisdom of all ages. He knew his time was near, that in a few hours he would be betrayed, humiliated and crucified. Despite this knowledge, he loved and taught love as the one absolute rule that can measure life. In commemoration of this truth and of its central relevance to the Scottish Rite, all Rose Croix Chapters observe Maundy Thursday (its name, a corruption of the courtesy of Neyenesch Printers inc , San Diego, california 65"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"A Latin word rnandaturn—commandment) on the middle day of Holy Week. It has been called, variously, “Holy Thursday,” “The Day of the Supper of the Lord,” “The Day of Mysteries.” Traditionally, the Christian world fixes it using the date of Easter Sunday, which is the first Sunday after the full moon which happens on or after March 21, the vernal equinox. Also traditionally, Free - masonry has remembered this special day, and Brethren have gathered throughout the world to reaffirm their faith in the universal fraternity of mankind. The first written record of such observance is a ritual of the Eighteenth Degree Charles de Ladebat prepared and published in 1856 in New Orleans. The Code of Statutes adopted in 1866 lists Maundy Thursday as a feast day, and as of 1878, the Statutes indicated its observance as obligatory. So it has remained ever since in the Mother Jurisdiction. So it may ever remain. The words of Maundy Thursday speak to the hearts and minds of all men. But words alone do not suffice. The Great Master matched his words to acts. He knelt before each of his Disciples and washed the feet of each as an act of total humility and love. In this symbolic act of self - sacrif ice and service, the message took on practical form. The truth was given substance. Intention without action is of little use. On Maundy Thursday, Jesus spoke the truth and lived its words. So we of the Scottish Rite in observing Maundy Thursday honor its message and recommit ourselves to its fulfillment. Fraternally, we love one another, and we extend that New Commandment the Great Master gave to all mankind, everywhere, at all times. This is the meaning of Maundy Thursday. This is the message of Masonry. Tenebrae Light-dark. Good-evil. Life-death. Hope-fear. These are the polar oppo - sites of life. They represent the ends of the spectrum of existence. In their dynamic juxtaposition, their eternal combat, we can see life as a creative, developing force. “More light!” These, the last words of the great poet Goethe, represent the philosophy of Scottish Rite Freemasonry. We seek more light. Even when faced with the darkest of times, with apparent death itself, we know that light and life will triumph, that the myriad demons of ignorance, prejudice and hatred cannot overcome the forces of knowledge, fraternity and love. The dawn will come. “That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” [John 1: 9] It will never go out. These are the concepts represented in our ancient ritual of Tenebrae, the “Extinguishing of Lights.” One by one, we see the candles quenched. Bit by bit, the darkness gathers. Evil strengthens. The forces of chaos come together. Despair looms and seems to triumph as the last light disappears. We are cast into utter darkness. There seems no hope, no salvation, no rekindling of life possible. Then, miraculously, the splinter of light shatters the darkness. It flickers. It seems to vanish. Then it glows with a renewed brilliance, all the brighter it seems for shedding its beams in total darkness. Feeding upon hope and cour - age and compassion, it flares forth reigniting the candles 67 66"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"4; ‘I, 6 At~ ~ ~-& te’ ~, 6 ~‘0 Spring Passes Softly, quietly, through the trees Steals shy Spring from the wind-blown seas, And as she passes, tall trees bend down With eager fingers to snare her gown.

Clausen that had been extinguished. Our lives reflect this light and we kindle within ourselves renewed confidence and joy. So the symbolic meaning of Tenebrae brings the Craft’s Light to all Masons. A candle of understanding in our hearts mimics the altar’s flames and lifts us to new heights of Masonic aspiration. Then we, having inward lamps, pass these on to others, opening their eyes to the brilliance of Freemasonry. Tenebrae asserts in candle, wax and flame the simple truth that faith, hope and charity will never die. Darkness must yield to light. Tyranny will fall to freedom. Order and truth will ever conquer chaos and confusion. Passover Through ritual we define ourselves. We join, in a means deeper than words, in a shared tradition. Whether we are in a ritual or only observing it we act our beliefs, and in so doing we become what we believe. This is true of the Jew - ish Passover, a covenant meal whereby a people created itself and continues to define itself. The ritual’s roast lamb, bitter herbs and unleavened bread commemorate the Exodus from Egypt. Moses forewarned to let the Hebrew people go. The Pharaoh of Egypt endured nine plagues that devastated the land, yet he was stubborn. He denied Israel’s cry for freedom. Then came the tenth plague. The Angel of the Lord struck down the firstborn of every Egyptian family, including that of the Pharaoh him - self, but the Angel “passed over” the homes of the children of Moses. They had placed a ritual lamb’s blood on the doorposts and lintels of their homes as a token of their ~1~ * 65 69"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"fidelity to Jehovah. Crushed, Pharaoh gave orders for the Hebrews to leave—and quickly. They did, pausing only long enough to eat hurriedly the hasty ritual meal they had prepared. Through the timeless prism of history and myth, the Passover ritual gives perspective to current situations. The people of Israel recall in it the bondage of Egypt, the flight to the Promised Land and their unending battle to secure freedom. In the Passover, we see a reaffirmation of the covenant between God and man, a reinstatement of the principle that all men must be free and that they will have divine sustenance in this effort. The Passover is a religious celebration, the “feast of all feasts,” for Jewish society. It is also a symbolic statement for all mankind. In the Passover ritual we see hope rewarded, persecution overcome, hardship endured and freedom won. Physical and spiritual liberty are victorious. Tyranny is overthrown. With God’s help and with unfail - ing faith in this divine guidance, all men can look to the shining light on the mountains of human dignity and free - dom. The Passover promises escape from the land of dark - ness and bondage—no matter what the clime or time—to all men. It is this essential theme that binds the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry so closely to this greatest of Jewish feasts, the Passover. Jamshedji Nauroz The Scottish Rite of Freemasonry takes proper pride in tracing its origins back to the Medieval Ages, and into antiquity. The ancient wisdom of Pythagoras is as rele - vant as the mysteries of Dionysus and the annals of King Solomon. In fact, the taproot of the Craft goes deeper still to the very oldest of cultures and religions—Parseeism, or the Fire Worship of Persia and India. It is no mere coincidence that the Parsee festival named Jamshedji Nauroz occurs on the 21st day of March, the vernal equinox. King Jamshedji, the second monarch of 71 Israelites Passing Over he Red Sea—Fugel Photography by H Armstrong Roberts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"the old Peshdadian Dynasty which lasted 700 years, intro - duced the solar calendar to his people and declared the first day of the vernal equinox a festival bearing his name. This decision corresponded with a Persian tradition that the world was created at the vernal equinox, the world’s original creation being echoed in the annual rebirth of life as spring sets in. The seasonal change from dormancy to growth reflects a deeper philosophical principle which sug - gests that these ceremonies and discoveries of Jamshedji Nauroz had a Masonic derivation. The religious basis of Parsee Fire Worship is Zoroastrian dogma. Zoroastrianism rests on an absolute distinction between light and dark, good and evil, truth and false - hood. There is no moral or metaphysical relativism to blur e edges of moral categories. The believer is taught to clearly between right and wrong, embracing distinguish e first and abhorring the last. He is enjoined to seek ght and to shun darkness, ever to nurture in himself the spiritual and beneficial while shedding gross material interests and desires: The feast of Jamshedji Nauroz, taking place at the ver - nal equinox and placing such stress on a dualistic interpre - tation of life, is definitely Masonic in character. Its philosophy complements the ideals of the Craft and reveals how fundamental and timeless the principles of Freemasonry are to all humanity. 72 j courtesy of Trans National Tiavel, Boston, Massachusetts 73"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"33~ Conclusion Christian, Jew, Parsee—each keeps the festival of the vernal equinox in his own manner whether it is the obser - vation of Holy Thursday, the Passover, or Jamshedji Nauroz. Each event—appropriate to its special signifi - cance—is combined in the Mystic Banquet which the Brethren of the Scottish Rite celebrate on Maundy Thurs - day. Here the Rite commemorates the dignity and divine origin of man. It sees the essential truth which structures each ritual. In the diversity of image, place and detail that each observance affords, the Rite brings into clear focus the elemental lesson of rebirth, freedom and fraternity. The Parsee Jamshedji Nauroz teaches us ever to value truth and virtue. The Jewish Passover underlines the alliance between man and God, a covenant built on free - dom and dedicated to liberating man from all domination whatever its form may be. The Christian Holy Thursday brings us the absolute, New Commandment: “love one another.” The Scottish Rite observance of Maundy Thurs - day is like a mighty river into which many streams feed. It combines the strengths of each tributary making the con - fluence into one clear channel of faith and action. Refined from age to age and country to country, the one Masonic message comes to us in the Craft and Nature herself so underlines. Each observance is at or near March 21, the vernal equinox. As the earth brings forth life, these special days point to man’s spiritual rebirth. Each promises that the rvlystic Quest for the Lost Word will meet with success. Man will find a reality that is seen with more than eyes. In 74 the midst of life’s fleeting shadows, these rituals shed a bright light that reveals an abiding hope, a sustaining con - fidence in man’s innate ability to be reborn. Like nature in spring, we can shed the burdensome winter of selfish materialism and spiritual decay. We can bring forth new fruits of personal and communal accom - plishment. Man is a part of nature and made with the same hand that brought light and shape to an earth which “was without form and void.” [Genesis 1: 2] Both nature and man are images of God; both came from the divine plan of The Great Architect of the Universe. The Scottish Rite of Freemasonry has embodied this truth in Maundy Thurs - day, a ritual that fuses the great religions of man into a single unified statement of divine purpose and human capability. Let us join in this observance, a sublime celebration of light, freedom and Fraternity. Extinguishing of the Lights Follow the Rituals Banquet and Mystic Banquet The memorandum of Brother Samuel I. Jacobs’, 330, California Orient Coordinator for Ritual, and my related Decision will clarify this subject. 75"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"It is hard to conceive of any ritual more beautiful and inspiring or any ceremony in Masonry more soul- stirring and profound, than our Maundy Thursday Service, which includes the Tenebrae (Extinguishing the Lights) and the Feast of the Paschal Lamb, or as it is often called, The Mystic Banquet, or Feast Obliga - tory. To our Jewish Brethren it signifies the Feast of the Passover, which is an annual reminder of the priceless heritage of freedom and a call to struggle for it by eternal vigilance. To our Christian Brethren it signifies the Last Supper Jesus and His Disciples attended to celebrate this ancient festival, after which there followed His death and resurrection. The Passover was a festival instituted to com - memorate Jehovah’s “passing over” the Israelite houses while “passing through” those of the Egyptians in order to destroy them. In the early history of these celebrations a lamb without blemish was taken on the lath and killed on the 14th day of the Hebrew month Abib, which occurred at the spring of the year. The blood of the lamb was to be sprinkled on the two side posts and the upper door post, and the flesh eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs before the morning. Jehovah, passing over the blood stained doors, slew the first born in the Egyptian houses not similarly protected. St. Paul likens the Paschal Feast to the resurrection of Christ, but no matter what the interpretation, in Masonry it has no creedal signifi - cance. To our Brethren of the Rose Croix it is known as the Mystic Banquet, and it is obligatory for every Knight Rose Croix, on Maundy Thursday, to break bread with a Brother and partake of a portion of roasted lamb. This beautiful Ceremony is but another method of bringing to our minds those great moral truths with which we already have been indoc - trinated. It is in that spirit that we assemble, as Masons and as Brethren, bound with solemn ties and no thought of any particular creed or religion. Our Illustrious Sovereign Grand Commander, Henry C. Clausen, 330, has commented to me that in at least one Valley in our Orient, where the members had gathered for dinner prior to the Ceremony of Extinguishing the Lights, reference to the Mystic Ban - quet was completely omitted and no reference was made at that time or afterward to the symbols. These symbols, which should be explained to the Knights attending the Ceremonies, are as follows: 1. The Matzo, or unleavened bread, also called bread of affliction. It is symbolic of the bread which the Hebrews made when they hastily left Egypt, because they did not have enough time to allow their dough to leaven. The Matzo is the most important symbol of the Passover. 2. The Moror or bitter herb (represented with a small slice of horseradish), symbolic of the hard - ships which the Israelites endured when they were slaves in Egypt. 3. The Haroses, a kind of paste of apples, nuts, and raisins, symbolic of the mortar the Israelites used when they were slaves in the construction for the Pharaoh of the treasure cities Pithom and Ramses. 76 77"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"4. The Shank Bone, a roasted bone symbolic of the .Paschal Lamb that was sacrificed and eaten on eve of the Passover. 5. The Hard Boiled Egg, symbolic of life and the springtime when nature renews life. 6. The Four Cups of Wine (to be substituted with grape juice), commemorating the four promises made by God to Moses to redeem the [sraelites and bring them out of bondage. An explanation of these symbols of the Mystic Banquet gives the Ceremony much of its true meaning. The distribution of this [memorandum I had my approv - al and the concurrence of the Committee on Rituals and Ceremonial Forms.

Upon entering, ushers seat them in a special section, close to the stage but to the side. Guests are seated in the main center section of the auditorium and behind the special candidates and ladies section if necessary. When the curtain is opened, the stage shows the ring with two pedestals, one close to each side of the ring. The wife of the Venerable Master stands at the pedestal right of the ring (left of the audience); the wife of the Senior Warden is at the left of the ring (right of the audience). On the pedestal of the wife of the Venerable Master is a silver tray with the “rings” lined up in alphabetical order.

The procedure is then repeated with the second couple, but after the scroll is presented, this time the Junior Warden steps to the stage and escorts the couple to their seats. By then, the Master of Ceremonies has resumed his seat and the sequence of name, ring, scroll, seating, is repeated with him as the escort of the third couple. The Junior Warden escorts the fourth couple and so forth. These steps are repeated until all couples have walked through the ring and been seated.

Among them, Socrates, who saw the truth and persisted with questions until others were forced to answer truly, he whom an ungrateful populace forced to drink the fatal hemlock; Hypathia, the noble virgin of Alexandria, she whom a savage populace tore to pieces, incited by a Christian bishop swollen with pride and potent in his palace, he silenced her lest her error prove to strong for his truth; De Molay and his wardens, the victims of despots who feigned horror at impiety and blackened the character of their vic - tims to justify their murder; and Galileo, who rashly ventured to demonstrate that 94 95"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the earth was not stationary or the center about which the sun revolved and those who claimed to be the infallible inter - preters of God’s words imprisoned him. Yes, for him who was wiser than his time, the hemlock was distilled, the cross raised, the senseless mob loosed and the flames surrounded the stake. Remember, however, that no king, priest or mob ever has destroyed truth. Reason never ceases to take an appeal from the judgments of force. Power and craft may curse the truth and call it crime, heresy, treason; they may distort and pervert it, slander and slay its teachers, but ever the sun shines by day and the stars by night and light does not die away from the earth. It is the martyrs of political and religious truth who win eternal glory. We may ask: Who remembers the names of their execu - tioners? Let me remind you that, while the Masonry of the Kadosh recalls the deaths of martyrs and inculcates the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity, it also maintains the necessity of law and order. Freemasonry rejects the notion that viola - tions of law or private vengeance are to 96 correct social evils. The Kadosh, as you know, have no cry of revenge, but say “Vengeance is thine, 0 Lord, Thou wilt repay. INSTALLING OFFICER [Illustrious] Brother _______________ , your peers and Brethren of _____________ Con - sistory have been pleased to elect you to be their Master of Kadosh. Wherever there are dignity and honor in office, there are also labor, perplexities and grave responsibilities. In Masonry, as in every other order or in the state, peace and harmony, the progress and prosperity of the whole, will, in the greatest meas - ure, depend upon the capacity and fidelity of those who govern. In all voluntary societies, the many expect the few to labor while the many look on, and, to the few, this labor must often be its only reward. Expect, therefore, often to find yourself toiling with little assistance. One of the degrees of your Body dem - onstrates that from the earliest of ages Man has had a solid conviction that he hath within him a spiritual nature, a soul that is not to die when the body is dis - solved, but is to continue to exist and may be admitted to the realms of light and life eternal.

It will be your duty, when the Master of your Body requests, to present a lecture upon the history, philosophy or symbolism of the Order. It is indispensable, therefore, that you should make yourselves familiar with these subjects, so that you may be able to instruct and enlighten the Brethren and that your addresses may be worthy. Brothers Chancellor, as the title of your office indicates, you are privy-councillors or legal officers of your respective Bodies. It is your duty, upon request of the Com - mander or Master of Kadosh, respective - ly, to give him your opinion as to the Constitutions, Statutes and By-laws of the Fraternity. It is essentially necessary that you, yourselves, be thoroughly familiar with our laws and regulations. Brother Minister of State, you, also, are a privy-councillor to the Master of Kadosh. It is your province to pronounce dis - courses upon such subjects and on such occasions as competent authority may direct. I need not enlarge upon the necessity of diligence and study. The sym - bols of Masonry are not fixed dogmas, but images of infinite interpretation. Masonry is not encompassed with a cer - tam routine and a few words of catechism. Remember that one does great injury to Freemasonry if he accepts an office and then neglects its duties. Brother Almoner, the Brethren of these Bodies have seen fit to select you to dispense their charities. Few men look upon distress and suffering without emo - tions of sympathy and pity, but few are instant in seeking these out that they may relieve them. That which is the common duty of all, too often is neglected by many. Also, the most deserving cases of need and destitution are often those which seek concealment and suffer in silence. It is your particular duty to seek out worthy objects of the charity of our Bodies. To visit the homes of the sick, the widow and orphan and to minister to them comfort and consolation belong to the mission and duties of Freemasonry and is that in which man most resembles God.

My Brethren, it is necessary that every Mason should consider that, since God has given him an excellent nature, wis - dom, the power to choose between good and evil and an immortal soul, He has also appointed for him a work and service great enough to employ these abilities and has designed for him a state of life to which he can arrive only with service and obedience. The service of his Holy House of the Temple is no sinecure and the prac - tice of Masonic duty is no life of ease and indolent content in which one sees the evils and wrongs of the world and yet says: “Let alone—it will last my day— Apres moi, le deluge.” Each Mason, were he but an Apprentice, must have the right to put his hope in God and that right he cannot have unless he so works as to deserve God’s favor.

As it is the people of the state that con - stitute the state, so it is the congregated Brethren of the Fraternity of Freemasons that constitute the Temple. Let us realize that each member is a living stone in this Holy House, and we should take care that each so lives and acts as worthily to com - mend the uninitiate to what we here teach and proclaim.

They should embody your profession of faith, your pledges, and should bind you to the noble creed which Isaiah the Prophet and Jesus of Nazareth alike taught—”. . and on earth peace, good will toward men. “God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.” Let us hope that this House will indeed be a Temple of peace and concord and not the home of self-righteousness or feuds or strifes. Persuaded that Charity and Loving-kindness will ever be enthroned between the columns of this Temple and that its altars will ever be consecrated to the great tolerant, generous and liberal principles of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, I rejoice in the fact that we are now about to dedicate and consecrate it as a Holy Temple, devoting it to virtue and good works wherein the lessons of wisdom, philanthropy, patriotism and moral philosophy ever shall be inculcated as they are ordained and prescribed under the universal constitutions of Scottish Rite Freemasonry. Agreeably to the ancient precept of our Order reminding us that Masons should never engage in any serious undertaking without invoking first the blessings of the Most High, let us reverently bow before Him, acknowledge our faults and errors and implore Him to give to us and to the world that Light toward which all Free - masons struggle—the Light of Truth, Knowledge, Wisdom and Loving-kind - ness.

May the Peace of God that passeth all under - standing be with us and abide in our hearts forever! For the blessing of the life and works of our dear departed Brother, we give Thee thanks. May the beauty of his life abide among us as a living benediction. May the love of God the Father bring peace to all who mourn and may the Heavenly Pres - ence comfort and abide among us all, both now and forevermore. Amen!

The soul, like a bird, flies in at one win - dow of the hall, flits quickly across it, and flies through another into outer darkness. Into what state it departs is not given us to know. It returns not to commune with us. We only know that we are, so it still is, in the hands of God, who invites us to call him our Father and to trust in His mercy and loving kindness. Surely, to His keeping we may be content to trust our friend and Brother, knowing Ceremony at Final Resting Place 128 129"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"that the divine soul is subject to no law of destruction or dissolution but returns to the Infinite from whence it came. Nor is our Brother wholly gone from us here below: His influences survive, the thoughts he uttered still live and the effect of his action and exertion can never cease while the universe continues to exist. He still lives a real life in the thoughts, the feelings and the affections of those who knew and loved him. While, therefore, Nature will have her way, and our tears will drop upon his cof - fin in sorrow for his departure and our own loss, let it comfort us to reflect that it is often a great gain to die, and that the omniscience of God may seem to be a blessing. His memory will not be Forgot - ten but he will be remembered with affec - tion and regret, especially by those who loved him and with the wondrous gift of memory we can still see within us his fea - tures, hear his words and possess his thoughts. We gently commit the body of our Brother to its final resting place. Give unto him eternal rest, 0 Lord, and may the immortal light illumine him. Let us devoutly entreat the assistance and sup - port of our Heavenly Father [Brother Prelate]. PRELATE [OR OFFICIANTI Our Father, under Whom we live, it has pleased Thee to take away from this world our beloved Brother, leaving behind the mortal tenement which now enters its final resting place. Enlarge and increase, 0 God our Father, all his influ - ences for good that do survive him. Let us not forget the lessons death taught us but, remembering the uncertainty of life, and the value of those things for which men do most strive, incline us more earnestly to endeavor to obey Thy laws, avoid dissentions, and labor to do good to our fellow men. Console his relatives in their affliction and sustain them in all the adversities and trials which they may have to encounter in this world. And may they and we, lov - ing and serving Thee, and trusting in Thy infinite beneficience, be in Thy good time gathered in peace unto our fathers and again meet our friend and Brother, nearer to Thy throne of glory.
