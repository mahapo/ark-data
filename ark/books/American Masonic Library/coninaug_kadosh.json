Popular assemblies, clothed with the p~~’s of legislation, are only concentrated mobs, and when the appetite for blood is roused, become bloodthirsty as the mobs themselves.

It was the same people that yelled for the blood of Charles the First, and was delirious with joy when Monk brought back Charles the Second. It was the same Athenian people that ostracized Aristides and accepted the Thirty Tyrants. A chance as ridiculous as the tossing of a copper determines whether a great man shall be idolized or execrated. Persecution, also, and proscription of the right of thought, is not confined to any church. It was the Cli ristian Bishop of Alexandria, Cyril, who incited and employed the human bloodhounds that kennelled in the city, to tear asunder the tender limbs of the Pagan vir - gin Aspasia. The most intolerant of all have been the Church of Scotland, and the Puritans on each side of the Atlantic.

The former ages were the creative epochs that have diecided. the diestiny of the human race. The men of those epochs, like the antediluvian animals, were of a greater and ruder type. God swept away pop - ulations by wars, as he exterminated the now extinct races in whose fossils the history of the old woridi is written. Human life was then all force, activity, and struggle. The Orders of Knighthood, the Crusades, the great revolutions of religions thought, reproduced. the commotions and epidemics of the forgotten centuries. In those ages, men risked all, to win all. Then the many lived to toil; and so they still live. The few lived. for glory, and. risked all to win all. Now, the nations are led by the nose by small attorneys, ambidextrous politicians, and crafty gamesters.

Conscquently, those groat moral and doctrinal rules which are coiled religious, do not spring from calm - ness and reflection. The great religious founders have not been inetaphysicians. Men like Moses and Mahomet are men of action, not given to speculation. They master Humanity by proposing action. Hence it is that Charlatans so often succeed in becoming L chiet, and that the men of Thought and Intellect have so little to do with the daily lit of nations, and always disappear in periods of agitation. Then the Burkes and Ilirabeaus are failures, and the Couthons and Musts become terrible. The great deeds of a Nation are usually done by the minority, and the opposition always creates the glory of a country. The instincts of every people • teach it that its greatest men can only attain the full measure of thefr influence and glory by the sanctification of death and the baptism of blood; and these, therefore, are those whom it puts to death. The populace is made fickle and cruel, the Tyrant is made savage, by fear, that there may be heroes illusa trious in prison and on the scaffold; or persecutors are created, that there may be martyrs.

In no insti - tution was reform ever needed more than it is now in Masoni’y. In none was there ever a more lamentable barrenness of results.

Thereforc, in seeking to reform or instruct men, be satisfied with that which is practicable and possible. Do not believe a Utopia possible. No political or religious Millennium is near at hand.

There are few who do not seek to lay up treasures on earth: there are almost none who love their neighbor as themselves. For the vast majority of men these principles are too sublime; so that they are hardly deemed to form a part of the Divine law.

The symbol of this Charity is tim Holy Ark of our Ineffable degrees, the Ark of the Sanctuary, which represents the Soul of the righteous man wherein the Divine Presenee always dwells between the winged ohorubim, REAsoN and F 1 um, whose plumes meet over the Mercy-Seat, where the sins of feeble human. nature are expiated.
