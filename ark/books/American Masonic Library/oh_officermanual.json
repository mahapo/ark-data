GENERAL OUR LAWS Every member who aspires to leadership in an Ohio Lodge shoul d personally possess an up-to-date copy of the Constitution, Charges, By-Laws, and Code of the Grand Lodge of Ohio, the Candidate Counselors Handbook, and this Manual. He should be thoroughly familiar with their contents and keep them current. Every Lodge Officer should be prov ided with a Code at the expe nse of the Lodge when he is first appointed to an Office. All the Elected O fficers should constitute a committee for presenting the Code section by section as part of a permanen t program of each Stated Meeting. These Officers must be able to discuss and answer questions on the matters presented. The Code is admirably adapted for such an interesting and instructive program which, if followed year after year, will result in a membership better informed in the fundamentals of the Fraternity. Our Constitution is short, covering only four pa ges, but every Article is of vital importance. Article XI provides that the Grand Lodge of F. & A.M. for Ohio is the only sovereign and independent body of Freemasonry existing in the st ate of Ohio. In 1995, how ever, the Gr and Lodge recognized The Most Worshipful Pr ince Hall Grand Lodge of Ohio, F. & A.M. as being a regular sovereign and independent body of Masons which also has independent jurisdiction within the State of Ohio. The Charges of a Free Mason are a part of th e Constitution (Article X II). These need to be read frequently for the welfare of our Lodges and the fellowship that they establish among our members. The By-Laws recite many requirements with which our membership should be familiar. The Uniform Code of By-Laws pr ovides that no amendments may be made except in the manner prescribed therein. UNIFORM CODE OF BY-LAWS The By-Laws of every Lodge must conform VERBATIM to the Uniform Code of By- Laws as adopted by the Grand Lodge and as set fort h in the Code. These may be changed only when required by the Grand Lodge. (Cod e, Section 15.03, and Uniform Co de of By-Laws, Article XV). STANDING RESOLUTIONS A Lodge is authorized to adopt Stan ding Resolutions. (Code Section 15.04) PUBLICITY The public announcement of the place, time, and purpose of a meeting of a Lodge is permitted, as are announcements of the Installation of Officers, presentation of awards, Dedications, Consecrations, Reconsecrations , and Cornerstone Laying Ceremonies. The proceedings of a Lodge, with all the tr ansactions thereof, petitions, committee work, etc., are as private and inviolate as the Ritual. It is therefore un-Masonic to announce or disclose them to the public. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 5 The names of Candidates or their pictures, the na mes or pictures of Lo dge Officers conferring Degrees, and any other information about the internal affairs of a Lodge will not be given to the public press, or otherwise exhibite d, disclosed, displayed, or related. Th is rule applies to areas of a Masonic building to which non-members have access. A Public Relations Kit, incl uding news release templates, approved advertisements, and a How-to Brochure, is available from the Grand Secretary’s Office as well as at www.freemason.com . Proper public relations will help to ensure a Lodge’s future. FUNERAL SERVICES A Masonic Funeral Service may be conducted as authorized by Code Chapter 22. The Funeral Service is separately printed and is obt ainable from the Grand Secretary. The use of the suggested Service is not mandator y. Any other Service used should be in good taste and conform in general to Masonic custom. It is preferable that the Service be delivered from memory. If read, it should be read with dignity and e xpression, as befits the occasion. Be sure to understand the meaning and pronunciation of unfamiliar words. The Funeral Service is one of the few public functions of the Lodge. Do it well. It is advisable to have two or more Brothers prepared to conduct a Service. If no Brother of the Lodge is available to do a cred itable job, another Lodge will undoubtedly extend the courtesy of supplying a competent Brother to conduct the Service. At such a Service it is appropriate that all the Brethren be clothed in white aprons and if desired white gloves. Lodge Officers, Grand Lodge Officers , and District Deputy Grand Masters may wear the apron of their Office. BEHAVIOR AS A CITIZEN “A Mason is oblig’d by his tenure to obey the moral law, ...a peaceable subject to the civil powers . . . .” Masonry is a unique institution. It permits no man to make innovations in its body of principles and landmarks. It was never intended th at it should move en masse; nor have a patriotic, social, industrial, or ec onomic program; nor engage in any political controve rsy; nor espouse a religious faith; nor harbor a pol itical party; nor promote the in terests of a philosophical sect. As an organization the world should know only that there is such a thing as Masonry; and no particular publicity should be given to the fact that one is a Mason. But Masons should be foremost and preeminent in every activity of life. For lead ership the Mason should be without a peer in government, social, business, industrial, club, frater nal, religious, and home life. That a man is a Mason should be a guarantee of sterling integrity, and an hone st and sincere faithfulness. COMMUNICATIONS AND MEETINGS Meetings of the Grand Lodge are called “Com munications.” The Grand Lodge is required to hold a Communication annually. All other Communications are called Special or Emergent. Meetings of the Lodges are “Lodge Meet ings,” either Stated or Special. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 6 CORRESPONDENCE When addressing mail to a Brother do not put his Masonic title as such on the envelope.

LODGE OPERATIONS ATTIRE Proper attire is a nece ssity and vital factor in adding dign ity and impressi veness to the conferring of Degrees and accords to the Fraternity its due and merite d respect from the Officers of the Lodge or of the Grand Lodge. Each Lodge decides the proper atti re for its Officers; however, ther e is much to be said in favor of formal dress. Formal attire, after 6:00 p.m., consists of full evening clothes or tuxedo. As the Master is clothed, so sh ould all the Officers be attired that the harmony of uniformity and good taste may be evident. Every Officer and every Brother serving as an Of ficer pro tem, should be attired in a manner appropriate to the station or place he occupies. The members will dress acco rding to private taste, clothed with aprons, and any authorized Lodge or Grand Lodge decorations. As previously noted, gloves, if worn, must be white. Etiquette calls for the removal of one’s gl ove or gloves when shaking hands. APRONS, GLOVES, AND JEWELS The white apron is the distinguishing badge of a Freemason. Whenever it is worn, the apron should be worn outside the coat . Whenever a Grand Lodge Officer or other Mason for whom a distinctive apron has been designated by the Gr and Lodge is present at a Masonic meeting or communication, he may wear the apron so designated. While the Ritual specifies that our Brothers are entitled to wear th eir aprons in specific forms, it is common practice for Master Masons to wear them as Fellow Crafts because of the inference to our symbolic status as Fellow Craf ts in life and because it is more convenient to do so. When gloves are worn in the Lodge they must be white in every instance. When a Brother serves pro tem in an Office to which he has not been elected or appointed he wears the jewel of that Office. He may wear the apron or no t, as local custom provides. The jewels of Lodge Officers are made of silver or white metal. The Officer is invested with the insignia of his Office at the ti me of his Installation and this in signia indicates his position in the Lodge. The jewel should always be worn as a desi gnation for a particular Office and never as a mark of distinction or private adornment. The jewels of Grand Lodge Officers are of gold or yellow metal and are worn with the same designation as Lodge jewels. Je wels of part gold and part silver are not appropriate. Jewels or regalia of bodies other than Grand Lodge or subordinate Lodges are not appropriate in a Lodge meeting and should not be wo rn therein. (The Ma ster will exercise discretion in enforcing this regulation so as to avoid offense to a visitor.) "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 8 PUNCTUALITY The Master will begin Stated Meetings punctually at the time provided in the By-Laws, or set for Special Meetings. It is extremely discourteous to the Master for Officers and members not to be present prior to the appointed time. The Worshipful Master is charged with seeing that the work progresses without delay and closes at a suitable hour. ARRIVING LATE AT LODGE If a Brother is late, he does no t request the Tyler to obtain permission for him to enter until he is properly clothed. The Tyler is to inform him of the Degree on whic h the Lodge is op ened, enter the Lodge Room only after the alarm is given and an swered, through the door guarded by the Junior Deacon and, if the Lodge is at la bor, proceed to th e Altar, salute the Master with the due guard and sign, and take a seat among the Brethren. If, however, the Master is engaged and disturbing him would be disruptive to the Lodge, the Brother may instead go to the West and salute the Senior Warden, or if he is also engage d, go to the South and salute the Junior Warden. If a late arriving Brother finds himself in the Lodge without havi ng previously determined the Degree, a careful examination of the Great Lights will reve al the correct salute to be given. The due-guard and sign should be given accuratel y, not in perfunctory or slipshod style, but in a manner to show respect for the Office to which the salutation is made. The Officer saluted may remain seated and acknowledge th e salutation with a nod of his hea d. The due-guard an d sign are never given while seated. ANTEROOM, TYLER’S ROOM AND PREPARATION ROOM As soon as a Brother enters a Masonic building to attend a meeting, he must subject himself to all the requirements of th e most exacting Masonic conduct. At no time, and particularly if he is late, should an arriving Brother indulge in loud talking that may be heard in the Lodge Room. His demeanor toward other Brethren in the Anteroom or Tyler’s Room should be courteous, respectful, a nd gracious, as Masonry does not give any man license to take personal liberties with another. While this should be the rule of his conduct always, it is especially true if a Candidate is present, awaiting a call to the Pr eparation Room. To give Candidates or other Brethren the impression that vul gar conduct, obscene stories, levity, practical joking, or other forms of disrespect are countenanced by the Craft is a misrep resentation of that for which Masonry stands. The Preparation Room is never to be used as a means of access to or from the Lodge. It is for the use only of Candidates and Offi cers while participating in the co nferring of Degrees. To permit it to be used otherwise is contrary to the explicit inst ructions of the Ritual. It is the duty of the Tyler and Junior Deacon to see that th is rule is strictly enforced. VISITORS When a visiting Brother seeks admission to a L odge, if there is none to vouch for him, he shall be required to present to the Tyler a photo ID, such as a valid Driver’s License, and a current dues card of his membership in a regular Lodge, authenticated by the Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge in which his Lodge is located as to the regu lar standing of the Lodge, by the Secretary of the Lodge as to his Masonic standing, and by the signatu re of the Brother in whose name the card is"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 9 issued for personal identification. The Tyler shall ch eck the Brother’s membership card with the list of recognized Lodges, as furnished each Secretary by our Grand Lodge, to ascertain if the visitor’s Lodge is recognized by our Grand Lodge. No Test Oath or examination questions shall be required of the visiting Brother. Once he is determined to be a member in good st anding of a regular Lodge recognized by the Grand Lodge of Ohio is can be admitted to the meeting. The Grand Lodge of Ohio recognizes the Prin ce Hall Grand Lodge of Oh io and Connecticut. Lodges in those Jurisdictions are deemed as “re gular” and their members in good standing can visit Ohio Lodges. To determine if an individual’s Lodge is one of the regular Prince Hall Lodges in Ohio, one should visit their Grand Lodge webpage: www.phaohio.org/mwphgloh . There are other “Grand Lodges” in Ohio, but they are clandes tine and their members are not permitted to be admitted to our Lodge meetings. VOUCHING The Code provides that a Brother cannot vouch for another Brother unless he has previously actually been in Lodge with the visiting Brother . The fact that a Brother has been vouched for does not remove the necessity of his displaying a current dues card to the Tyler. One Brother may not vouch for another Brot her over the telephone. At all times of avouchment, both Brothers must be present. Presence in any Masonic body other than a recognized Lodge does not constitute lawful information as to a Br other’s membership in a Lodge. OPENING AND CLOSING A LODGE The opening and closing Ceremonies are re quired at each Lodge meeting. Our Ritual provides: “The short form opening and closing Ceremonies may be used ONLY if the full form opening and closing Ceremony of any one of the thr ee Degrees shall have been used during the same meeting. If the meeting is for the purpose of Inspection, the fu ll form opening and closing Ceremonies of the Degree in which the Inspection is being held MUST be used.” The duty of closing the Lodge is as imperative, and the Ceremony as so lemn, as that of the opening. No Lodge can be opened or closed by anyone without obser ving this ancient form and usage. The Grand Master or his Designated Representa tive, has the inherent right to assume the chair of any Subordinate Lodge in which he may be present, and govern the Lodge as its Master. As such he may therefore declare the Lodge opened or closed in ample form as he sees fit. GUIDE FOR CONDUCTING LODGE BUSINESS 1. The Lodge shall meet and open for its Stated Meeting at the time and place specified by its By-Laws. The record of its proceedings at the last Stated Meeting and all intervening Special Meetings shall be read and subjected to correction and approval."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 10 2. When a Brother rises to speak, he shall respec tfully address himself to the Master. If he transgresses the rules of the Lodge, in speaking or otherwise, the Master shall call him to order and he shall sit down immediately, unless permitted to explain. 3. A petition for the Degrees or Affiliation is pres ented to the Lodge at a Stated Meeting, read and, if in proper form, received, noted in the minutes and referre d to a Committee by the Master without any vote being taken by the Lodge. 4. When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be restated by the Master, or if it has been written, it shall be read by the Secretary. It is then considered before the Lodge and cannot be withdrawn except by permission of the Lodge. 5. Should a duly seconded motion be declared out of order, the action must be recorded in the minutes. 6. A Brother shall not speak more than twice on any question without permission from the Master or more than once until all Brot hers wishing to speak have been heard. 7. No Brother shall speak unless he is recognized by the Master. 8. When a motion is under debate, no motion shall be received except to amend, to refer it to a Committee, or to postpone final decision (i.e., to table the motion) to a future Meeting. 9. Any member may call for a division of the mo tion where the nature of the subject will permit. 10. Motions and Reports may be referred to Co mmittees at the discretion of the Master. 11. A motion to amend, until decided, shall preclude all other amendments of the main motion. 12. An irrelevant amendment, or motion submitted under color of an amendment, or a substitute for the motion under debate, is not permitted. 13. The debate ceases at the will and pleasure of the Master. 14. There shall be no debate after the Master has called for a vote on the motion. 15. Every member present who is entitled to vot e shall be required to do so unless excused by the Lodge. 16. All matters before the Lodge for determinati on shall be decided by majority vote unless provided otherwise by proper authority. 17. A member of the majority that voted on the motion shall be permitted to move for reconsideration of a motion. 18. The decision of a Master on a question of Mas onic law is final, with no right of discussion or appeal except to the Grand Lodge. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 11 (It is a prudent Master who al ways keeps a copy of the Grand Lodge Code with him during all meetings of the Lodge. Page 111 of the Gr and Lodge Code provides an easy reference for “Methods of Voting and Balloting.) ADDRESSING THE CHAIR A Brother who has anything to say to the Lodge, whether it be to enter discussion or to make or second a motion, must rise to his feet, salute, a nd address the Worshipful Master. Note: the salute of any degree is made by giving its du e-guard and sign. The step is not given. DISCUSSIONS IN LODGE Regulations governing discussion in Grand Lodge are prescribed in the Rules of Order, printed in Code section 11.12. Grand Lodge representatives will familiarize themselves with these rules prior to their attendance at Grand Lodge. Regulations for discussion in Lodge are stat ed in our Constitution, By-Laws, and Code, and conformity thereto is essen tial to proper conduct therein. Except as required by Code section 11.04, the discussion in Lodge, Grand Lodge, or gatherings of Masons at refreshment, of politic al or private business, or any other Non-Masonic subject by which men are divided in to classes, or that may engender feuds, schism, or disturb the harmony of the Lodge, is at all times forbidden. It is strictly prohibited to discuss a Candidate after the ballot on his petition has been ordered by the Lodge. When balloting, a Mason is prohibite d from disclosing how he voted when casting a ballot, or seeking to influence memb ers to ballot one way or another. All uses of personalities, expressions of bitte rness or resentment, f lippant, unseemly, or discourteous remarks addres sed to the Lodge or its Officers, are condemned alike by th e principles of conduct and disciplinary laws of the Craft. ORDER IN THE LODGE ROOM All members will behave in a seemly, gracious manner, regarding every Brother his peer; generous in attitude toward the opinions of others yet kind and fi rm in sincere convictions during discussions and conduct of business, always with due regard for the regulations of the Lodge and the laws of the Grand Lodge; thoughtful and attent ive to Ceremonies being conducted, observing all signs and gestures of courtesy and respect th at harmony and dignity may prevail. While the responsibility for maintaining or der rests with the Worshipful Master, adhere nce to these requirements will add pleasure to the performance of his duties. LODGE PRAYER AND THE UNIVERSALITY OF FREEMASONRY Chaplains and others who offer prayers in Lodge and at Masonic events, sometimes forget that Masonry is universal, or ignore that fact and insist on their own religious terminology. The universal nature of Freemas onry should never, under any circumstances, be forgotten or ignored, even if every member present is of the same religious belief. Keeping in mind the lessons learned as Entered Apprentices will better enable us to help others understand that universality in Masonry means universality—all the time. When invoking the bles sings of Heaven, we mu st always take care to keep our references to the Deity non-sectar ian, such as “God” or “Grand Architect of the Universe.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 12 USE OF RELIGIOUS MUSIC The universality of Masonry likewise counsels th at vocal and musical se lections which draw one’s attention to a particular faith are inappropriate in Lodge , and are especially unacceptable during conferral of the Degrees. Re spect for our members’ and Candi dates’ religious beliefs means just that—and we both protect ha rmony and promote Brotherly love by guarding against insensitivity to the feelings of our Brethren. MASONIC CUSTOMS The customs of Masonry have never been prescrib ed in our written laws but have come down to us through the years as traditions developed in th e Lodges and refined over time. Therefore, for the sake of uniformity and convenient reference, we have sought to set out here our most important customs and usages. In principle, these customs belong to the empi re of good manners, that code by which gentlemen the world over govern their conduct. However, this principle in Masonry is found to apply on two levels: it become s not only a standard of respect for the Craft as a whole, but a form of courtesy for the individual as well. Freemasonry solicits no man. However, ther e is no objection to encouraging “a good man and true” to seek membership. The procedure fo r seeking membership may be explained to a potential Candidate. After a full explanation of the Cr aft’s purposes and goals is made to him, he should be left to make his own decision and ask for membership of his ow n free will, having formed a favorable opinion of Freemasonry thr ough the good reports of its reputation. Harmony is the first law of the Lodge as it is of Heaven. For one man to live in unity with another is the very essence of the Fraternity. Sin ce it is the nature of decorum to protect harmony, good conduct is the bulwark of the Craft. It is also a guarantee of equality in the treatment of the members, that equality in which each man is treated with the same courtesy as every other. In Lodge meetings, conduct takes the form of proper decorum. L oud talk, restless moving about, laughter, flippancy, irreverence toward th e Worshipful Master and other Officers of the Lodge, passing between the Altar and the East, om ission of the due guard and sign, giving no heed to the business at hand, improperly entering and l eaving, are all unseemly and improper behavior and are not permissible. “You are not to hold private Committees, or separate conversation, without leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinent of unseem ly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any Brother speaking to the Master; no r behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn; nor use any unbecoming language upon any pretence whatsoever; but to pay due [respect] to your Master, Wardens, and Fellows.” (Ancient Charges, Part VI, section 1, “In the Lodge while constituted.”) MASTER’S COVER There is no written law requiring a Master to remain covered at all times. To wear a hat is generally recognized as a symbol of his Office and is inherently a part of the system of Masonic symbolism. Therefore it is entirely fitting that he do so. It is a toke n of superiority of rank or Office, a visible and conspicuous sign of his position as Presiding Officer and actual head of the Lodge. A chapeaux or fez when worn as part of a uniform in connection with the appearance of a uniformed group as guests of the Lodge are permissible only before the Lodge is opened or while it is at Refreshment and only during the pe riod of the group’s participation. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 13 The hat should always be removed during prayer , at the mentioning of Deity as a sign of respect, and also when giving the obligations as a token of the sacre dness of the pledges being taken. It should also be removed during the reception of the District Deputy Grand Master, and/or the Deputy Grand Master and Grand Master. EMBLEMS AND SYMBOLS Masonry’s one method of teaching its principles to Candidates is by emblems, symbols, and allegories. Without these, the symm etry and completeness of the exemplification of the Degrees is not achieved, it is obvious the Lodge must see that its emblems and symbols are of correct design, well cared for, accurately located, used and explained as strictly and fully as is required by the Ritual and without private inte rpretation by the Lodge. Miniature Warden’s columns may be displayed, if desired, but their proper position must be carefully maintained by the Warden s. The Senior Warden’s column is in an upright position and the Junior Warden’s is placed horizontally during labor. Their positions are reversed during Refreshment, and at such times a salute is unnecessary. The pillars, of correct de sign and height, should be placed on each side of the inner door of the Preparation Room, the pillar bearing the celestial globe being on the right of the Candidate as he enters. They may be placed against the Senior Warden ’s platform or steps if so desired, the pillar bearing the celestial globe being on the right of the Senior Ward en. During the Fello w Craft Lecture, they will always be placed as near the Preparation Room door as the Lodge Room will permit. The Perfect Ashlar is located near the Southeast corner of the Master’s platform or steps, and the Rough Ashlar near the North east corner of the platform. The Letter G is properly placed above the Mast er’s chair. Lodges often have a Letter G which can be separately illuminate d. Some of these Lodge s illuminate it if all Masons present have received the Fellow Craft degree, but otherwise leave it dark. When co nferring the Fellow Craft degree these Lodges ofte n illuminate the Letter at a certain point in the G Lecture. These practices are not rules, however, and each Master will know what is fitting for his particular Lodge. The accessories used in the Lectures should be dignified in appearan ce, adequate in size, correct in design, and repl aced when worn by use. The Bible should be handled with care and reverence at all times. Where its pages have become soiled or torn, they should be cleaned or the book replaced. Clear plastic sheets, can be used to protect the pages. Jewels, regalia, robes, Candidates’ uniforms, hoodwinks, staffs, and ap rons must be kept clean and in good order. FLAG The flag of the United States should be mounted in a standa rd placed on the Master’s platform in the corner to the Master’s right. When posting the colors all Bret hren will rise, face the flag, stand at attent ion, and salute by placing their right hand over th eir heart. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 14 It is improper to use the flag as drapery for th e Altar, or on any chair, seat or station in the Lodge Room, or as bunting for decorative purposes. The flag should be given precedence over the bann er of the Lodge or any other banner used in the Lodge Room, in public procession s, or when displayed on a Mas onic building. The Ohio flag, if displayed, should be mounted in a comparable sta ndard placed in the East in the corner of the Lodge to the Master’s left. When a Lodge banner is displaye d in a Lodge Room it shou ld be placed behind the Secretary’s desk. ALTAR Symbolically the Altar is a cube in shape, though in practice it is made oblong. It should stand in the center of the lodge room. The cente r is determined by the intersection of two lines, one drawn from the northeast to the southwest corner s and the other drawn from the northwest to the southeast corners. The representa tives of the Lesser Lights are proper ly placed, when one is at the Altar’s northeast corner, a second at the northwest corn er and a third at the center of the Altar’s south side. It should not be moved during a meeting, nor s hould the lights be moved or extinguished. In size, its top should be large enough to hold the Th ree Great Lights, allowing space for the ballot box without shifting the open Bible. The ballot box should never be placed upon the Bible. No other objects except the appropriate draping should be placed on the Altar. When the Altar is draped out of respect for a deceased Brot her, the top of the Altar should be covered with a suitable cloth of black, on top of which the Bible is placed. This cloth must never cover the Great Lights. The Altar should ne ver be covered nor decorated with the national flag. Cut flowers may be placed on the Altar, next to but not at op the Bible during a memorial service. The space between the Altar and the East is d eemed “sacred ground,” not to be trodden under foot; hence passing between the Alta r and the Worshipful Master is forbidden except as called for by the ritual of the particular Ce remony being performed. When the Lodge is at Refreshment, one may pass between the Altar and the East. References to the Bible obviously refer not only to the Bible but to any particular Holy Book which may be in use. The appropriate Volume of S acred Law of the Candidate’s faith is to be used, and references in the Ritual adjusted accordingly. MASONIC TITLES In the usages of Freemasonry, “Brother” is neither a sentimental nor a familiar form of address, but it is a title, a distinction, and an h onor, as much as “Right Worshipful Brother” and “Most Worshipful Brother,” and mu st always be used as such. A member does not attend a Lodge meeting in hi s capacity as a private individual, but as a Freemason. For this reas on, in open Lodge always refer to a Brother in the same manner as any Officer in Lodge or Grand Lodge. Harmony and dignity will be the result of faithful adherence to this simple practice.

Always address a Grand Lodge Officer at a ll communications and me etings by his correct title, and he in turn must show the same courtesy to other Grand Lodge Officers present as well as to the Worshipful Master, Wardens, and Brethren. This rule of condu ct must be punctiliously observed no matter what ties of family or friendship may exis t. When addressi ng any Brother, regardless of his rank or title, good taste dictates that his surname always be used in c onjunction with his title. The use of given names or nicknames is improper dur ing Lodge meetings, as is dropping the word “Brother” from the honorific—the form “Worshipf ul Smith” or “Right Worshipful Jones” is never to be used. It is proper when making announcements or when speaking in open Lodge, either as a member or visitor, to rise at your place and wa it to be recognized by the Worshipful Master. On receiving recognition from him you should salute an d proceed by first acknowledging the Master. If the Grand Master, District Deputy Grand Master, and/or others, such as Grand Lodge Officers, are also in attendance it is improper to acknowledge their presence by the words, “Distinguished East.” If you wish to group the others, for expediency, they should be addressed as “Distinguished Brethren.” Under no circumst ance should the Worshipf ul Master, the Most Worshipful Grand Master, or his representative be included in such a grouping. Thus, for a large group, the correct form of address is either, “Worshipful Master, Mo st Worshipful Grand Master, . . .” or “Worshipful Master, Most Worshipful Gra nd Master, Distinguished Brethren . . . .” (The presiding Officer is addressed first.)

The Gr and Master is the highest ranking Mason in Ohio, regardless of the Masonic body in which he is sitting. If either is present, for example at an Inspection, it is their privileg e to speak after the DDGM who is representing the Grand Master. The highest ranking Officer present of these three (the DDGM, Deputy Grand Master, Grand Master) when present, has the ri ght to demand admission into, or leave, any Subordinate Lodge without the permission of the Master, and to assume control of the Lodge. No Brother will be formally received and given Grand Honors after reception of the members of Group IV except with the permissi on of the ranking Officer present. When the Master has been inform ed that the Grand Master, or his Official Representative is about to enter, he will direct the Senior Deacon (or the Marshal) to retire to the Anteroom and escort such Officer into the Lodge Room. After the usual alarm, the Tyler announces to the Worshipful Master through the Junior Deacon, “Right Worshipful Brother __________, Distri ct Deputy Grand Master of the ___ District, is about to enter.” If there are two or more DDG Ms present, the Tyler will announce through the Junior Deacon, “District Deputies of the ____ District are about to enter” . Should the Deputy Grand Master be the highest ranking Officer present, the announcement will be “Right Worshipful Brother______ Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ohio, is about to enter.” If the Grand Master is pr esent, the Tyler will announce through the Junior Deacon, “Most Worshipful Brother _________ the Grand Ma ster of Masons in Ohio is about to enter” . (The use of the word “all” with the phr ase “Masons in Ohio” is inappropriate.) As the District Deputy Grand Master enters, the Lodge is called up; the Master rises and uncovers. He remains uncovered until formally request ed to resume charge of the Lodge. The Senior Deacon (or Marshal) escorts the Di strict Deputy Grand Master to the Altar, where both salute the Master, and the escort says: “Worshipful, I have the honor to pr esent Right Worshipful Brother, _______________ District Deputy Grand Master of the ______ Masonic District, representing Most Worshipful Brother ______________ , Grand Master of Masons in Ohio,” after which the escort, without further direction, conducts him to the East where the Master asks the Brethren to join him in extending Grand Honors. The Master then greets him and welcomes him with the following or another suitable address: “Right Worshipful District Deput y Grand Master, on behalf of _________________ Lodge, and all other Brethren assembled, I ex tend to you a most cord ial welcome. We are honored by your presence. May I ask that you do us further honor by accepting the gavel and presiding over our deliberations?” The gavel is extended to the District Deputy Gr and Master, who accepts it, immediately seats the Lodge, and responds to the Mast er’s greeting. He then either assumes control of the Lodge or concludes his remarks, returns the gavel, and is s eated at the left of th e Worshipful Master or elsewhere as he may wish. When receiving the Grand Master or Deputy Gra nd Master, the same procedure is followed as shown above. After which the Senior Deacon immediately escorts him to the East."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 18 When other elected Grand Lodge Officers or Past Grand Master s visit a Lodge, the procedure is the same regarding the entering of the Lodge . They are introduced and Grand Honors are given while they are at the Altar. As it is usually known by the Mast er when distinguished guests will be in attendance, he should designate some brother to meet them in the anteroom and write down their names and titles, and to facilitate their entrance, arrange them in groups for the Senior Deacon in accordance with the four groups. The introduction of visitors in a Lodge is a duty usually assigned to the Senior Deacon. When the Tyler informs the Worshipful Ma ster through the Junior Deacon th at distinguished visitors desire admission, the Master will instruct the Senior Deacon to retire and escort them to the Altar. It is always the prerogative of the Master, however, to a ppoint a Marshal to serve in presenting visitors. When the Senior Deacon (or Marshal) has one or more of a group ready to be presented he will instruct the Tyler to advise the Master through the Junior Deacon, who says, “The Senior Deacon (or Marshal) desires to present Distinguished Visitors”. When the Mast er permits them to be admitted, the Senior Deacon (or Marshal) will escort them with the first Brot her to his right and the others, if any, following in single file, to the Al tar and facing the Master. He will introduce them with their names, titles, and Office. The wisdom and propriety of recognizing ma ny Brethren who have rendered distinctive service to the Craft is acknowledged, and it should be done. Past Masters, 50-year members, and such can and should often be presented at the Alta r or elsewhere, and their Masonic contributions noted with a gracious acknowledgmen t by the Worshipful Master and a hearty greeting (not Grand Honors) accorded them by all present at an appropria te break in the Degree, but not before or while Groups I thru IV are being introduced. INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE— Carefully Read Code, Chapter 24 As an important safeguard to Masonry, it is recommended that a petitioner be required to answer and sign a questionnaire co ntaining rigid and searching ques tions about his personal life and conduct, and his motives and objectives in petitioni ng. The questionnaire should be reviewed with the petitioner by an appropriate co mmittee. Pertinent information cont ained in the questionnaire may be used to further the investigation. If there is anything questionable about the petitioner, the Lodge should be given the benefit of the doubt. The pe titioner is the one who creates the doubt and not Masonry. Our first duty is to guard well our door. Some Lodges use a permanent committee for i nvestigation of Petitioners. One advantage of this is experience of its members. Other Lodges prefer to use a new committee for each applicant, which usually gives responsibility to mo re members, and if newe r members are called on to serve with the older and more experienced Brethren, it becomes a valuable process of education of newer members. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 19 Some Important Pointers • Be on guard against a tendency to carelessness. • Don’t overlook any references—the la st one may be the one needed. • Masonry owes an applicant nothing. • Ask him if he has ever been arrested, convict ed or pled guilty to a crime and served a sentence for the crime. • If there is a doubt, resolve it in favor of Masonry and the Lodge. • Discover whether the appli cant will strengthen the Fraternit y. It is not enough that “he is as good as some other Masons.” It is often better to lose one than to gain one who adds nothing. • The applicant’s family, his neighbors, his fe llow workers, and his employers, usually know him best. • Ask yourself if the applicant would be accepte d as an intimate in your own home, or the homes of your members. • Make your final decision objectively, based on facts. Don’t allow your judgment to be swayed by sentiment or emotion. • Ever keep in mind that the prim ary purpose of Freemasonry is to inspire in its initiates, who must be men of good character and moral depo rtment, a desire for higher thoughts, nobler deeds, and greater achievements. We cannot hop e to undertake the moral reformation of a society as whole. • Investigations should be so conducted that ev en if rejected the applicant gains higher respect for the Fraternity. BALLOT Except for the Holy Bible, the ba llot is the most sacred thing in the Lodge. Ev ery Mason owes his Lodge the duty of protecting it against unfit Candidates and every Mason owes every petitioner a fair and impartial ballot. The upright man and Mason, true to the traditions of the Craft in casting a ballot, will never be actuated by prejudice, selfish motives, or vindictiveness to influence his behavior at the ballot box. It is strictly forbidden for a Mason to re veal how he will or has balloted or in any way to seek to influence the ballot of othe r members. For the last several years, each Grand Master has directed the reading of specific language to the Lodge before the ballot is declared open. These directives are transmitted to the Master by the District Deputy Grand Masters, who will always have the most up-to-date information. BALLOTING ON A PETITIONER After the Petitioner has been interviewed by the Investigation Committee, and their report is read in open Lodge, the ballot is ordered by th e Worshipful Master. Th e procedure for casting a ballot on the petition varies throughout the state. The Worshipful Master orders the Senior Deacon to prepar e the ballot box. The Senior Deacon examines the contents to determine that th ere are both white balls and black balls or cubes in the box. They should all be in the front side of the partition in the box. The Worshipful Master then orders the Senior Deacon to display it to the Wardens. He takes it first to the Juni or Warden who opens the box to determin e that the there are balls and cubes and that they are all in the front side. The box is then carried to the Senior Warden who also examines the contents."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 20 The Senior Deacon then carries the box to the Worshipful Master who also examines the box. He then asks each Warden, “Brother (Junior Warden or Se nior Warden) is the ballot box clear in the (South or West)?” The Warden responds, “Clear in th e (South or West) Worshipful.” The Worshipful Master also states that it is “C lear in the East”. He then reads the statement on balloting issued by the Grand Master. He then says “I now declare the ballot open for the election or rejection of Mr . __________________ to membership in th is Lodge, the Investigation Committee has reported (favorably or unfavorably). All Brothers eligible to vote will rise”. Only Master Masons who are members of the Lodge vo ting are eligible to ba llot. The Worshipful Master casts his vote first reaching into the box and passes a ball or cube thru to the rear portion of the box. In some areas of the state, the Senior Deac on then takes the ballot box and the petition to each Master Mason in the room for them to cast their ballot. The Senior Deacon moves clockwise around the r oom. When the Senior Deacon arrives at a Brother, he salutes the Worshipf ul Master. He may read the pe tition if he chooses and vote. After he has cast his vote he sits down and the Senior Deacon moves on to the next Brother. In other areas of the state, the Senior D eacon places the ballot box on the Altar. The Brothers then form a line West of the Altar. As they reach the Altar, they salute the Worshipful Master, cast their ballot, return to their seat and sit down. After all eligible to vote have done so, the Worshipful Master asks “Have all Brothers eligible to vote, voted?” If all have indeed do ne so, the Worshipful Mast er then states “I now declare the Ballot closed. Brother Seni or Deacon, display it to the Wardens.” The Senior Deacon carries the box to the Junior Warden who examines the contents. He then carries the box to the Senior Warden who does likewise. And then to Worshipful Master who also examines the contents. The Worshipful Master asks, “B rother Junior Warden how sta nds the ballot in the South?” The Junior Warden replies “Clear (If no black cubes are in the rear compartment, or Not Clear, if one or more black cubes appear in the rear compartment) in the South Worshipful.” The Worshipful Master then asks the Senior Warden “Brother Senior Warden how stands the ballot in the West?” The Senior Warden replies “Clear (or Not Clear) in the West Worshipful.” The Worshipful Master then states “I find the ballot Clear (or Not Clear) in the East.” If the ballot is clear the Worshipful Master states “I declare that you have elected Mr. __________________ to receive his Degrees in __________________ Lodge. Brothe r Senior Deacon, destroy the ballot.” The Senior Deacon then places all the balls and cubes into the front compartment. The Worshipful Master should set the date for the man to r eceive his Entered Apprentice Degree as soon as possible and the Secretary should be instructed by the Worshipful Master to send the man a “Notice of Election” using Grand Lodge Form 24 as a guide. The Lodge E ducation Officer should assign a Candidate Counselor that night and give him the contact in formation for the newly elected member and have him contact the man to start his mentoring as soon as possible. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 21 If the ballot box has ONE black ball or cube in the rear section, the Junior Warden and Senior Warden must declare “I find the ballot NOT CLEAR in the (South or West) Worshipful. After the Worshipful Master examines the box he st ates “I find the ballot NOT CLEAR in the East. Brother Senior Deacon, destroy the ballot and prepare the ballot box fo r another ballot.” The same procedure as outlined above is then followed. If the ballot box is “ NOT CLEAR” with at least one black cube or ball in the rear se ction after the Brethren have voted a second time, the Worshipful Master declares “I find the ba llot NOT CLEAR in the East. I therefore declare that you have rejected Mr.________ for membership in _________________ Lodge.” If more than one black ball or cube in th e ballot box after the fi rst ballot is taken, the Worshipful Master states “I find the ballot NOT CLEAR in the East and Mr. ________________ has been rejected for membership in __________________ Lodge. Brother Senior Deacon, destroy the ballot.” If the man is rejected, the Worshipful Master should instruct the S ecretary to send the man a cordial letter explaining that the Brethren of the Lodge have not accepted his petition for membership. This letter should be one that while informing him that he has not been voted into membership, he is thanked for hi s interest in the Fraternity. PREPARATION ROOM The interest and value of a ma n’s whole Masonic career may be contingent upon the gracious consideration and solemn treatment accorded him as a candidate in the Preparation Room; hence the Stewards are entrusted with a most delicate responsibility. The Candidate should be alone in the P reparation Room except for authorized personnel, awaiting the coming of the Stewar ds. The attitude of the Stewards toward the Candidate in the Preparation Room must be ch aracterized by the highest dignity and most exemplary decorum. The Candidate should be told that his neces sary preparation is symbolic and full of significance and a vital part of the work of the Degree, as he will shortly observe. The Candidate must also be read, verbatim, the st atement in the Ritual with reference to the Ancient Penalties of the Obligation before each Degree. CONFERRING DEGREES During the conferring of the Degrees , there should be silent and rapt attention to all that is said and done. Everyone present should have his mind centered on th e work for further mysteries and lessons that will unfold themselves with each new witnessing of the Degree. The Lectures are vital and an integral part of the Degree. They should be listened to attentively and thoughtfully and will prove of great spiritual valu e as they are absorbed. Their lessons will involuntarily become the rule and guide of your conduct through life. It is extremely discourteous to the Master and Of ficers and an affront to the Candidate to retire to the Anteroom before or while the Lecture is being delivered. If it is necessary to the Lodge for the Stewards or other Brethren to leave, this shou ld be mentioned to the Master in advance, and if appropriate, he will order them to depart at the required time."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 22 For the last several years, each Grand Master has directed the reading of specific language to the Lodge before the beginni ng of the Second Sec tion of the Master Mason Degree. These directives are transmitted to the Master by the Distri ct Deputy Grand Masters, who will always have the most up-to-date information. The giving of applause during or in connect ion with the conferring of Degrees is not consistent with the sublime solemnity of the Ri tual, detracts from the dignity of the lessons and is not in accord with Masonic custom. RITUAL The function of the Ritual is to impress upon each Candidate the lessons and principles of the Fraternity and to provide a sh ared, common experience for men who may be from very different religious, ethnic or social backgrounds. It shoul d accord the Candidate a genuine moral and solemn experience, while providing him a vision of a ne w life as a member of the Fraternity. It is important that all participating in the work of the Ritual be so imbued with its meaning that the solemn atmosphere of a Lodge, during the exemplification of the Ritual, will be felt by all present. Each O fficer should strive so to perfect himself in the exemplification of his part of the Ritual that he will be able to recite it accurately and impressively without conveying to the Candidate the impression th at it is something committed to memory. It is improper to discuss the Ritual in public, or to advertise it, or to publish pictures of it in any way whereby the secrets of Ma sonry may be unlawfully revealed. SIGNS Signs belong to the inner essence and esoteric life of the Craft. They will be given with dignity and uniformity. The Brethren should be cautioned to omit all due -guards and signs at Ceremonies to which non- members are invited. Under no circumstances will th e Master, Wardens, or Brethren remain seated while giving a sign. It is not necessary for a Brother to give the due-guard and sign of the Degree on which the Lodge is open when crossing west of the Altar. The due-guard and sign should always be given by a Brother or an Officer of the Lodge when addressing or being addressed by an Officer of a higher rank. THE DEGREE LECTURES AND CHARGES Every competent Brother may aspire to serve as an Officer and eventu ally Master of his Lodge, providing he understands, if he is selected, th at he must personally discharge the obligations and responsibilities that attend such preferment. One of the most important responsibilities is learning and delivering the Lectures and Charges of the three Degrees. Every Worshipful Master will be a better Master if he has committed to memory and delivered all the Lectures and Charges well before he assumes that office. Some Lodges ease the duties of the Worshipf ul Master by assigning the Entered Apprentice Lecture to the Junior Deacon, the Fellow Craft Le cture to the Senior Deacon, and the Master Mason Lecture to the Junior Warden. Some such a rrangement is highly desirable and is strongly recommended. Immediately on assuming Office, the Deacons and Stewar ds should consider it a part of their duties to begin learni ng the Lectures and Charges."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 23 The high spiritual significance of our teachings will unfold and give a conception of Masonry that will afford deep personal satisfaction and amply compensate for learning the Lectures and Charges. PROPER WORD PRONUNCIATION Many of the words used in the Ritual may be unfamiliar. It is vitally important to the proper communication of the lessons in the Ritual that all words be properly pronounced. As an aid to the Lecturer is this endeavor, there is a Pronunciatio n Guide on pages 163 and 164 of the Ritual. CANDIDATE COUNSELING The Worshipful Master will, at the time of his Installation, ap point a Lodge Education Officer and a sufficient number of Candidate Counselor s to conduct the Lodge Education Program. The Lodge Education Officer supervises the program , assigns Candidate Counselors, and keeps the Master informed as to the progress of the Education Program. The Lodge Education Officer should be pr ovided a current copy of the Candidate Counselor’s Handbook, the “On the Threshold” and Degree Bo oklets, together with their corresponding presentations, availa ble on paper or in Power Point, and the Lodge Education Officers Manual, as required by the Education Program. It is important to have availa ble the latest edition of the visual aids to show the el ected Candidate’s family the purpos e and teachings of Freemasonry. Details on the current Education Program, as well as the necessary forms, publications and additional resources can be found on th e Grand Lodge web site at www.freemason.com. DEGREE BOOKLETS The set of four Degree Booklets, On the Threshold, The Entered Apprentice Degree, The Fellow Craft Degree, and The Master Mason Degree, will enlighten the new Brother as to the meaning of Masonry. It will lay the foundation for a more la sting and fruitful future in the Fraternity. BIBLE PRESENTATION Many Lodges observe the beautiful, impressive, and appropriate custom of presenting to the candidate when raised, a copy of a specially prepared Holy Bible, or other Vo lume of Sacred Law as may be appropriate in the circum stances. Such presentation should be made—whether by the Master, Chaplain, or other Brother appointed by the Master— with a short and carefully prepared address, thoroughly learned in advance. The presentation page, with the record of th e Degrees received and the signatures of the Master and Wardens attested by the Secretary, makes it a personal possession prized by the Candidate throughout his life as well as impressi ng upon him this Great Light’s special place in Masonry. THE NEW MEMBER When the work of the Master Mason Degree is completed, keep in contact with the new member. His activity in the Lodge will depend on th e attitude the Master and Officers maintain toward him. Establish a contact fo r him within the Lodge; he may pr ove a valuable asset for Masonry in the years to come. Write to him, have birthda y cards sent to him; put him on committees; enroll him as one of the Fellow Crafts to be called on from time to tim e; let him be a helper with the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 24 Stewards at dinners or refreshments; put him wher e he may make acquaintan ces and friends; employ his capabilities; keep his interest alive and be zealous to see that he is not neglected. Convince him that we have an interest in hi m beyond the payment of his fees a nd dues and that his personality and the moral and spiritual contribution he can make toward Masonry is one of its most valuable assets. EDUCATION COURSES The Grand Lodge provides an Education Course for the enlightenment and benefit of our Officers in particular and our me mbers in general. The Courses are available on the Grand Lodge website at www.freemason.com. Upon request, a Certificate w ill be issued from the Grand Master recognizing the Brother’s satisfactory completion of the Course. Normall y, the Lodge Education Officer makes the request and presents the Certificate to the Brother in Lodge. ANNUAL DUES Read Chapter 30 of the Code carefully. Avoi d suspending a member if possible. Before suspending him, make a personal call to him. You will save many a member. A Lodge may purchase a “Lodge Dues Collection System” from th e Grand Secretary which will aid in managing this important area. Membership in all bodies recognized as Ma sonic is dependent upon and coexistent with membership in a Lodge of Master Masons. See th at each member of your Lodge fully understands this requirement and keeps himself in good standing in his Lodge by the time ly payment of his dues. ANNUAL RETURNS Read carefully By-Laws Chapter 7 so that you ar e aware of what is required and when it must be submitted to Grand Lodge. GRAND DUES Read carefully By-Laws Chapter 6. The subordinate Lodge is the agent of the Gr and Lodge in the collec tion of fees and dues payable to it. Good business practice should prompt each Lodge to segregate from the fees collected from Candidates and members of su ch amounts as are due and paya ble to the Grand Lodge, and all such money, so set apart, should be held and not paid out for any purpose whatsoever except for payment to the Grand Lodge. ELECTION TO OFFICE The peace and prosperity of a Lodge is ofte n disturbed because ther e is not shown that gracious spirit which recognizes the necessity of ch oosing those who best can work and best agree. Lodge Officers are elected or appointed. It is the prerogative of the Lodge to elect whomsoever it feels is best fitted to discharge the duties of the Office to be fi lled. Such el ection does not carry with it any intimation or guarantee of advancem ent by election to the next higher Office. In the event of a vacancy in an Elective Office, the Worshipful Master may fill the Office by appointment from meeting to meetin g. To fill the vacant Office perman ently, the Lodge must request a dispensation from the Grand Lodge authorizing a Sp ecial Election. An Officer errs in expecting to occupy the next higher chair of an absent Offi cer, except as provided in Chapter 19 of the Code. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 25 The sole requirement, save where a member must have held a specified Office to qualify him, is fitness and ability for leadership . The Lodge, or the Wors hipful Master, must be the sole judge as to the member’s fitness, so that neith er the Brother nor his friends should take offense at the action, nor should any ill feeling be engendered when our great er loyalty to the Lodge is exercised, in dropping an Officer from the line. There is no such thing as “advancement by right.” CONDUCTING AN ELECTION OF OFFICERS The Annual Meeting date is established in th e By-Laws of the Lodge. At this meeting, the Annual report of the Treasurer, Audit Committee and other functioning committees of the Lodge should be presented in written and oral form. The election of the Lodge Officers for the next year also occurs at this meeting. While the duties and requirements of the Offices are detailed elsewhere in this Manual, the Grand Lodge Code, the By-Laws and Standing Re solutions of the Lodge, the actual election procedure is not. It has long been a custom of Freemasonry that electioneering is not permitted in the election of Lodge Officers. The Code spells out these prohibitions. There is no reason why certain aids for a speedy and proper Election of Officers can not be implemented. New Brothers who recently joined the Lodge may have to be instructed as to whom the Officers are and how they are elected and appoint ed. A brief explanation by a knowledgeable Past Master of the Lodge before the start of the elections would be in order. He should explain that:  In order to be elected as Worshipful Master a Brother must have served the Lodge as a Warden or Worshipful Master.  The progressive elected line consists of the Worshipful Master, Senior Warden, Junior Warden, Senior Deacon, Junior Deacon.  Even though there is order of advancem ent in the Officers line, no one is automatically advanced to the next Office.  The Treasurer and Secretary ar e not in the advancing line.  The Tyler is normally a position that is held by a Brother on a continuing basis.  A Trustee can be any Brother in the Lodge.  A certain Brother because of age, health or employment cannot accept an Office for the next year. A printed information sheet listing the current Officers and their Stations can be a helpful guide for the election process. The Worshipful Master instruct s that paper ballots be distri buted and appoints Brothers to collect the ballots and Tellers to ta lly the votes. A count is made of the number of Brothers present who are eligible to vote and a ma jority number is then determined, as the election to Office must be by a majority not a plurality. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 26 The order of election is as follows:  Worshipful Master  Senior Warden  Junior Warden   Treasurer  Secretary  Senior Deacon  Junior Deacon Tyler  Trustee The Worshipful Master states , “I now declare the ballot for the Office of ________ open.” Each Brother writes the name of a qualified and suitable Brother on the ballot. When all Brethren have completed their ballots, the Worshipful Master states, “Have all eligible to vote completed their ballot? I now declare the ballot for _____ closed. Brethren, co llect the ballots.” The ballots are gathered in spare top hats and given to the Te llers to count them. The name on each ballot is read aloud and totaled by one of the Tellers. Afte r all ballots are read a nd totaled, the totals are given to the Worshipful Master. If the total for one Brother is or exceeds the majority number, the Worshipful Master states, “Breth ren, a majority has been reached for Brother ______ for the Office of ______. Brother _________ do you accept?” The Brothe r rises, salutes the Worshipful Master and replies, “Worshipful I accept.” If he does accep t, the Worshipful Master then declares the ballot open for the next Office. If the Brother does not accept, another ballot is taken in the manner as the previous one. There are as many ba llots taken as necessary until a majority is reached and the Brother w ith the majority accepts. Another voting procedure which may be used is for printed ballots with the Office and blank line next to it for a voting Br other to fill in a name. No ballo t is to be used with the Office and the name of a Brother already printed next to it. All balloting must be by written ballot. The Worshipful Master instruct s that paper ballots be distri buted and appoints Brothers to collect the ballots and Telle rs to tally the votes. A count is made of the number of Brothers present who are eligible to vote and a num ber is determined as the major ity number for election. He then states, “I now declare the ballot for suitable Brothers to serve this Lodge as elected Officers for the ensuing year open.” Each Brother eligible to vote should then mark his ballot with the names of Brothers he deems worthy of serving the Lodge. After a period of time allowing all the Brothers to mark their ballots, the Worshipful Master declares, “I now declare the ballot closed, Brethren collect the ballo ts.” The ballots are collected, usually in a spare top hat and given to the Teller s for counting. The votes for Worshipful Master should be tallied first. They are read aloud from each ballot, and one of the Tellers totals the votes. At the completion of the counting, the Teller announc es to the Worshipful Master the outcome. If a majority is reached, the Worshipful Master states “Brother (or Worshipful Brother) ______________ you have been elected by your Brothers to serve this Lodge as Worshipful Master, do you accept?” The newly el ected Brother rises, salutes the Worshipful Master and states whether he accepts or does not accept the Office. If he accepts he is congratulated and the tally proceeds to the Senior Warden. If he does not accept, another ballot must be taken following the above procedure. Additional ballot s must be taken until a majority is reached for one Brother. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 27 After the Worshipful Master is elected, the tally continues for each Officer with election occurring only when a majority is reach.

It is often desirable to have non-tiled meetings for pr esentation of service pins and awards to permit families to witness these events.) B. DELIGATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES In order to develop well-qua lified leaders, the Lodge shoul d offer a program by which its Officers can learn, first-hand, the various duties which combine to challenge each Worshipful Master during his year as Presiding Officer. These dutie s have been identified as Administrative, Ritualistic, Fina ncial and Social. These classifications are not intended to be the last word on the subject, nor should it be regarded as a rigid rest riction upon any Officer's field of usefulness. However, th e Worshipful Master should info rm each of his Officers what is expected of him. 1. Assignment of Work and Duties Much of what is contained in the follo wing section has devel oped over time and is traditionally practiced in subordinate Lodges in Ohio. Some of it is new. The “Assignment of Ritualistic Work” presented below is inte nded merely as a guide that, if followed and improved from year to year, may prove pe rsonally rewarding to the officers of the subordinate Lodges, and help strengthen Mas onry. Assignments in learning ritual Lectures and Charges should be adjusted so that all ar e given before election as Worshipful Master. 2.

The leaders at the top, fail to keep other members apprised of what is planned for the future, while the members in turn, do not keep the leaders informed regarding the problems that are occurring regularly. (b) Regular and informative Officer meetings can do much to provide communication and prepare the line Officers for future respon sibilities. Such meetings will promote a continuing program and will help to avoi d too many abrupt changes with each new Worshipful Master. The wise Worshipful Master will avai l himself of all the counsel and assistance his Officers ca n give him, always reme mbering that he has the responsibility of final decisions. (d) Make plans now to hold monthly Officer Meetings with your Officers when you"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 35 become Worshipful Master. Such meetings can be of great help to the Master and the Lodge as both can benefit from the ideas of the other Officers. These meetings also give the other Officers a feeling of being a part of the Lodge. 2. The Grand Lodge Code (a) Serving a Masonic Lodge in the various Offi ces from the first appoi ntive station through Worshipful Master should be a constant pro cess of growth for the individual concerned. The customary term of several years should witness a consistent increase in poise, facility of speech, administrative ability, financial judgment, ease of planning and decision, and brotherly love. Too often, ''going through the chairs'' is regarded as a means of marking time until a normal process of attrition confers a title and a measure of responsibility upon the person selected as Worshipful Master. Those who so regard it do an injustice both to the Lodge and to themselves. (b) A portion of the charge to th e Worshipful Master at the time he is installed states, ''The Book of Constitutions, our Masonic Code, you are to search at all times. Cause it to be read in your Lodge that none may pretend i gnorance of the excellent precepts it enjoins. You will also receive in ch arge the By-Laws of your Lodge which you are to see carefully and punctually execute d. Lack of knowledge is not an excuse for violation of our Masonic Law. You have a responsibility to your membership to make certain that all have the opportunity of becoming familiar with its provisions as well as the requirements of your Lodge By-Laws.” (c) Attention is directed to ''Our Laws'' shown on page 4 of the Officers Manual which reads as follows:  “Every member who aspires to leadersh ip in an Ohio Lodge should personally possess an up-to-date copy of the Constituti on, Charges, By-Laws, and Code of the Grand Lodge of Ohio, the Candidate Counselors Handbook, and this Manual. He should be thoroughly familiar with their contents and keep them current.”  “Every Lodge Officer should be provided w ith a Code at the expense of the Lodge when he is first appointed to an Office. All the Elected Officers should constitute a committee for presenting the Code secti on by section as pa rt of a permanent program of each Stated Meeting.” 3. Ritual (a) Supervise the work of your Officers. Hold rehearsals. (b) Attempt to improve your work. No matter how good it is there is always room for improvement. (c) Have a plan of assignment or work and duties for your Officers. Encourage junior officers to learn Charges and Lectures. (d) See that your robes are in good condition and kept clean. Ask the trustees to inspect them and replace if necessary. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 36 4. Education (a) Plan Educational Meetings. (b) Use your L.E.O. Give him an opportunity to present the Gr and Lodge Education Program. (c) Round-table discus sions are best. (d) Contact your District Education Committ ee Representative or D.D.G.M. for a competent speaker. (e) Conduct the meeting in the banquet room wh ere the Brethren are more at ease. (f) Have all Candidates present at the Educational Meetings. (g) It is most important that the L.E.O. and Candidate Counselors have the support of the Master and other Officers. If the program in your Lodge is not doing what you believe it can for your Candidates, confer with the D.D.G.M. If some new personnel are suggested, again be sure that interested and qualified Brethren are appointed, for this has been cons idered the most important program of our Grand Lodge. 5. Grand Lodge (a) The first notice of the Grand Lodge Comm unication will be se nt out in June.  Plan then to attend, or st art making plans to get some one else to attend in your place.  It is the Worshipful Master’s responsibili ty to see that the Lodge is represented.  Get reservations in as soon as possible. (b) The second notice will be sent ou t during the month of August.  READ the booklet “Announcement and list of Officers and Committees”.  Especially read the front page of the booklet.  PROXIES: Who will sign a nd how to use the proxy.  A listing of the proposed legislation to be presented and voted on at the Communication will also be included.  Read and discuss each piece during a Stated Meeting of your Lodge.  You can get a sense of the feelings of your members on the legislation.  You are responsible for voting according to your own conscience and not according to the wish of the Brethren of your Lodge. (c) If at the last minute you find that you cannot attend Grand Lodge, get someone else to attend in your place.  A representative of your Lodge must be an Elected Officer or Pa st Master of the Lodge. (d) As soon as you arrive in th e city hosting the Grand L odge Communication, you should"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 37 go to the Credentials Committee and regist er.

D. USE OF COMMITTEES The Master should select only those member s who will do a conscientious and thorough job, and who will be present when their reports are to be made. 1. Permanent Committees (a) The Master has at least four obligations in reference to his Permanent Committees:  To select the best men for each Committee.  To instruct them thoroughly in their duties.  To check frequently and see that th eir work is progressing as it should.  To recognize and thank Committee members for their service. (b) First and foremost is the Investigation Committee .  It is this Committee which guards the gates of Freemasonry and to the Committee should be appointed those Brothe rs of courage and integrity.

(e) Conduct or Grievance Committee which is to reconcile diffe rences between Brothers of the Lodge and when needed, prepare and prefer Masonic charges. 2. Special Committees The Master may appoint Committees to facilitate execution of a particular program, project, or meeting.  Observe the same precautions in the sele ction, administration and commendation of these Committees as recommended above.  Committee work is an excellent medium fo r creating and maintaining active interest among the membership.  The MASTER should appoint as many differe nt Brothers as possible to Committees so that more will be active in the workings of the Lodge.  Appoint every newly raised Brother to a Committee.

(d ) Ritual Committee : This Committee should:  Provide coaches for Officers or Brethren learning Lectures and Charges.  Provide coaches for Officers learning Degree work.  Check the Officers proficiency continually.  Help train potential Officers.  Should be a sizeable Committee, composed of proficient ritualists, and headed by a Past Master with consider able organizing ability. (e ) Finance Committee should meet regularly, and should include Brothers with the most financial experience.  The Treasurer should serve on it, as well as the Senior Warden.  The Committee should submit an annual estimated budget, and should manage the Lodge's investments.  Its Chairman should meet with the line O fficers at least once a year and discuss fully the problems of Lodge financing. (f) Audit Committee : This Committee meets once a year and reviews all of the Lodge’s books, accounts and investments.  It should be composed of members familiar with accounting practices. (g) Social Committee : The Senior Deacon or other Officer as Chairman should select several Brothers to assist him in planning a nd executing the various so cial events of the Lodge.  He should advise the Master and Wardens of the initiative and capability of those who work with him, as this Committee can be a good source of future Officers. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 39 (h ) Telephone and Email Committee : The personal telephone call or email from a Brother works well in building attendance at meetings and events.  The Committee Chairman should be select ed for his thoroughness and ability to develop contacts in the Lodge.  The members of this Committee should be from the various communities that the Lodge encompasses.  The Committee members should then divide up the names of the Brothers of the Lodge so that as few long distance calls as possible need to be made by each.  When the death of a Brother is reported to the Lodge, this Committee is informed and contacts are made to alert the Brothe rs of the time and place of the Masonic service.  With the advent of email, a list of email addresses shoul d be generated and notices sent to the members in this manner.  Please review Section 34.02, Paragraphs (f) & (g) of the Grand Lodge Code for information regarding re strictions on notices.

This special request should be honored, if at all possible. (l) Prevention of Suspension for N.P.D.

Ritual and Code: (b) General Regulations and the Lodge’s By-Laws The Worshipful Master is responsible fo r the compliance of his Lodge and members with the laws and regulations of the Gra nd Lodge. These responsibilities fall into the following areas:  The business and administration of the Lodge, and supervision during Lodge meetings.  The personal conduct and behavior of the members of the Lodge.  The Worshipful Master should be deep ly concerned about the good name and reputation of his Lodge and the Fraternity.  It is important to know that any changes or amendments to the By-Laws of your Lodge must be made by the prescribed procedure, must conform to the Uniform Code of By-Laws and, except for time of St ated Meetings and am ount of dues, must be approved by the Grand Master or Grand Lodge before they can become effective.  Accurate and impressive rendition of the en tire Ritual is a primary responsibility of"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 41 the Master. The Candidate has a right to e xpect the best the Lodge can give him, anything less than the best is ''short changing'' him.  The Degree work must be the pride and pr ivilege of each Offi cer, each member of the craft and all who participate.  The District Deputy Grand Master’s respons ibility is to see that the Lodge is performing the Ritual as it is written and will inform the Lodge when it is not in conformance.  The Master should see that the due guard a nd signs are given in a proper and snappy manner rather than given in a very haphazard-manner. 3. General Financial: (a) Budget Preparation  The first step toward a sound financial st ructure is the preparation of an Annual Budget, which will underwrite the planned program of the Lodge.  Any program, however desirable it may be, can succeed only if the necessary funds are provided for its function.  In addition to the special funds it may have established fo r a new building, new equipment, depreciation, etc., every Lodge should maintain an adequate working capital, of course, with sufficient reserve to insure against emergencies. (b) Administration of Lodge Funds To properly administer all Lodge funds the Master first must know the purpose of the fund, whether special or general. The special funds, particularly, will vary according to each Lodge's needs and customary practices.  All checks drawn upon the accounts of the Lodge should bear the signatures of three Brothers: the Master, Secretary and Treasurer. (c) Financial Duties The Master should work closely with the Se nior Warden, Treasurer , and Secretary on all matters affecting Lodge expenditures, and might well issue a “quarterly report” to the members on the state of their Lodge. (d) Auditing Accounts A complete and accurate audit of all Lodge accounts is required at the close of your fiscal year.  This audit must include any special funds in the hands of persons other than the Secretary and Treasurer.  The welfare of the Lodge depends on th e regularity of its accounts and the judgment used in the disbursement of its funds.  It is suggested that the Senior a nd Junior Wardens review the auditing committee report. This will familiarize them with audit procedures before they are elected as Masters of their Lodge. (e) Administration of Lodge Property The Lodge's investments, real estate and e quipment are important assets and must be properly maintained. This is the Trustees' responsibility. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 42 (f) Insurance Coverage Although primary responsibility rests upon th e Trustees, each Worshipful Master should ascertain that his Lodge is protected by adequate insura nce coverage at all times. Partial or total destruction of Lodge property by fire, windstorm, or other natural forces is an ever-present danger a nd an unfortunate accident resulting in personal injury to one or more individuals could involve the Lodge in a liability that might be very costly. Any one or all of these circumstances c ould result in a financial loss to the Lodge that would be disastrous. Most Lodges ha ve fire and extended coverage on their buildings, furnishings and paraphernalia, and all Lodges have public liability insurance covering both their members an d the public in the event of personal injury under the Grand Lodge's blanket policy. 5. Social and Welfare: (a) The Worshipful Master should plan and ex ecute a Social Program for the Lodge year, working closely with the Senior Deacon, or other Officers and Brot hers assigned this duty. (b) Family or Ladies Night  Plan to entertain the ladies or the families of the members.  Make it a special night instead of holding it on a meeting night.  Pot Luck Supper can make for a nice evening. (c) Awards Presentations  Do not overlook a veteran member. Plan to make the presentation to him as soon as he is eligible.  Remember the Grand Lodge provides Membership Awards for 50, 60, 65, 70 and 75 years of Masonic affiliation. See Resolu tion 11, Code, for e ligibility rules.  Present pins to newly raised Brothers.  Present 25 year pins.  Make this a big night annually fo r the members and their families.  If a Brother is confined at home or in a nursing home, go there to present the award.  Invite the District De puty to participate.  Ask a local Grand Lodge Officer or Past Grand Master to a ssist in presenting awards honoring more then 50 years of service. 6. Masonic Funeral Service: (a) Masonic funerals are the last measure of respect and devotion that your Lodge can pay to its departed Brothers. One of your most solemn and serious duties as Worshipful Master is to see that these funerals are conducted properly and impressively. (b) As soon as you learn of the death of a Brother you should call upon his bereaved family. Extend to them your personal condolences and sympathy of the Lodge.  Offer to help in any way you can. Determine if it is their wish – or the wish of the departed Brother – that the Lodge conduct a Masonic Funeral Service.  Every Master Mason who, at the time of hi s death, is a member in good standing or who, being the holder of a dimit, has peti tioned for affiliation within six months after the issuance of such dimit is entitled to Masonic Funeral Service."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 43  The Grand Master may authorize a Lodge to conduct a Masonic Funeral Service for an Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft Br other whose family has requested it.  Do not urge a Masonic service upon the fa mily. Render the Service only on request of the deceased Brother or the family.  Check with the family for the location of his lambskin apron. (c) A Masonic Funeral Service team may be or ganized among the Brothers to conduct the Masonic Funeral Service. The Worshipful Mast er will then always have a trained team at his disposal at all times. The funera l ceremony should be given from memory. The Tyler or some reliable brother should be designated to s ee that enough Funeral Rituals and aprons are available. (d) For communicating news of funerals, et c., the members of the Telephone and Email Committee should be informed and then they alert the Brothers. 7. Public Relations: (a) Master’s Responsibility to the Community  Civic and community relations are important to the Lodge and to the Fraternity.  They are maintained most effectively by the individual Mason who reflects his Masonic training in his da ily life and who does his dut y as a good citizen, rather than by official actions of the Lodge.  Remember the eyes of the community are upon the Lodge and its members.  The Master represents the Lodge , therefore set a good example. (b) Grand Lodge PR Kit  Available from the Grand Secretary’s Office or at www.freemason.com  Contains: news release templates, a pproved advertisements, and a How-to PR Brochure (c) Permissible Public Functions There are certain Ceremonies, which non-Masons may attend, such as:  Cornerstone Ceremonies conducted by the Grand Lodge  Masonic Funeral Services  The Open Installation of Lodge Officers  Lodge participation in civic or patriotic events , if approved by the Grand Master (d) Relationship to Public or Civic Campaigns Lodges should avoid controversial matters, part isan politics, and religious issues. Here again the Fraternity expects the indivi dual member to assume his own personal responsibility as he sees it, and yet in agreement with Masonic principles. (e) Relationship of the Lodge to Religion The Lodge is not nor can it be a substitu te for religion. The individual Mason, however, should be encouraged to fortify his religion an d his fraternity by actively worshiping according to the tenets of his own faith."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 44 (f) Understanding and Encouraging Masonic Charity Every Mason has solemnly promised to ''ai d and assist all wort hy distressed Master Masons, their widows and orphans'' when they apply to him within the broad meaning of the obligation he has taken and this applies equally to Lodges.  This responsibility never ceases and is not restricted by any arbitrary or established boundaries.  A timely visit to the sick or bereaved, the offer of a friendly hand, a word of encouragement or other services to the troubled are important aspects. Masons, of all men, should understand every facet of charity and the wise Master will encourage his members to be charitable in all their relations with mankind and especially with those to whom they are bound by fraternal ties.  The Five Points of Fellowship are not idle words. They might be called Masonry's ''Five Commandments''.  We must remember the Masonic widows, the sick and the unfortunate. To the extent of its ability, the Lodge should aid worthy Brethren, their widows and orphans who are financially distressed.  The establishment and maintenance of a Charity or Relief Fund should be considered. (g) Petitions Officers should always have with them one or more blank petitions. As the known representatives of their Lodge, they are most apt to be ap proached by a petitioner, who will be favorably impressed by a prompt tendering of a petition. II. ELECTED OFFICERS A.

No Mason should lightly refuse an appointment to office, and no Officer should stint in the diligent discharge of his duties, for any but the gravest personal reasons.  Upon the Officers of the subordinate Lodges rests the welfare of Ohio Freemasonry. The Lodges cannot run themselves-they must be le d by men who know what they are doing, are not afraid to analyze their ow n and their Lodge's weaknesses, and are prepared to give the time and thought to correct them.  As each Officer advances through the line, it is no rmal to look ahead to th e year that he will serve as Master from the time he becomes an Elective Officer, he should make plans for that year to come. These plans should be set down in writing for future thought and reference . Tentative plans should be formulated now with reference to those appointments, which must be made. Carefully note the qualifications, which ar e required for those appointments and during the years be constantly observant of the Brethren so that all appointments can be made for the best interest of the Lodge. Above all do not make these appointments from among your personal friends unless they can meet the rigid requirements of the various offices. A. SENIOR STEWARD 1.

The LEO also should be ready to arrange E ducational Meetings such as scheduling Lodge Room plays, Masonic movies, and securing qualified speakers with the help of the DDGM. The range of his duties is more fully covered in the Candidate Counselors Handbook and LEO Manual. The LEO assists the Worshipful Master in the selection of Candidate Counselors and schedules the instruction of the Ca ndidates by the Candidate Counselors. 2. Securing Effective Candidate Instruction with the Lodge Education Program (a) The LEO must always consider the qualifi cations of Counselors. The best Masonic instructor first of all will be a dedicated Ma son, one who is so devoted to the Craft that he really wants to assist in the important task of teach ing his Brethren. It is not necessary for him to be either a scholar or a ritualist, but he should have a good background in Masonry with the ability to impart what he knows to others. (b) The number of Candidates which your Lodge initiates each year will determine your need for Counselors. One method is to divi de the annual number of Candidates raised by three (3) and recommend that number of Counselors to be appointed. It may be your Lodge could easily use more or even less than this number. One Counselor may be appointed for each three Candidates raised, ba sed on a reasonable yearly average. The average Lodge of 150 to 200 or more memb ers should have at least two or three Candidate Counselors properly trained at all times. (c) Some Lodge Education Officers will say, “w e do not need any Candidate Counselors, as we do not have any Candidates.” Having tw o or more Candidate Counselors properly trained at all times will give you insurance in case the Lodge may get several petitions at one time. (d) A Candidate may not receive adequate C ounseling if a friend who lives near the candidate is appointed to do the counseling. The Candidate must learn about the Lodge he has joined from a well informed Brot her. Cooperation and joint planning between the Worshipful Master and L.E.O. is very important.

MASONIC CHARITIES THE OHIO MASONIC HOME For more than a century, the Masonic Fraterni ty within Ohio has been a dedicated and generous supporter of The Ohio Masonic Home in Springfield. The strong tradition of caring and compassion has become the hallmark of the Home. As a result, countless t housands of adults and hundreds of children have had a comfortable home at a very important point in their lives. Children no longer are a part of the Home’s services. To assure that such care continues to be available for future generations, the Home entered into a Corporate reorganizati on on March 1, 1997. That reorganization has provided for the operation of retirement living op tions through two subsidiaries, as well as the management of existing endowment assets and development of a dditional funding resources through an affiliated company. The subsidiaries are Masonic Retirement Village, Inc. and Masonic Health Care, Inc.; the affiliated company is The Ohio Masonic Home Benevolent Endowment Foundation, Inc. Each organization is distinct and governed by its own seven-member Board of Trustees, up to two of whom also serve on the parent board. Subsequently, the addition of three other subs idiaries has enabled the Home to expand its services throughout the state to better serve the Fr aternity and make services available to the community-at-large. Browning Masonic Community, In c. in Waterville, near Toledo, became a part of the Home in 1999; the former Hamilton County Eastern Star Home in the Cincinnati area became the Masonic Eastern Star Community, Inc. when it joined the Home in 2000 (clo sed in 2004); and, in 2002, the Home acquired the former Oaks of Medi na and created the We stern Reserve Masonic Community, Inc. in Medina. The Home has eliminated asset surrender, the pr evious means of financing one’s residence. Now all residents are admitted on a “pay-as-you-go” basis. If a Masoni c resident exhausts his or her personal resources, application is made for financia l assistance. But the Home remains true to its mission of more than a century to care for the “w orthy, distressed Master Mason, his wife or widow.” Thus, it continues to admit Masons, th eir wives and widows who have limited means of support at the time of admission. Eligibility criteria for residence in Mas onic Retirement Village have been expanded. Formerly, only Master Masons, their wives, widows, and children were eligible to reside at the Home. Now, a Master Mason’s parent s, parents-in-law, brothers, and si sters also may apply. Further, all of the same classes of relati onship to members of the Order of Eastern Star and the Order of the Amaranth are also now eligible. Finally, the restriction of Oh io membership was removed, and now, Masons from any jurisdiction recognized by the Gra nd Lodge of Ohio as well as members of Eastern Star and Amaranth from other jurisdictions may apply for admission. "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 53 The Ohio Masonic Home is a corporation operated by a 15-member Board of Trustees representing the Grand Lodge, York and Scottish Rites.

MASONIC HOME COMMITTEE Each Worshipful Master should appoint upon his Installation a “Masonic Home Committee” which will establish and maintain contact with the Administrator of the Home, and also such of their members, or their members’ families, who may be residents of the Home. This Masonic Home Committee will present to the Lodge, from time to time, information that will promote the interest of the Brethren in the Home and give them a better understanding of its purpose and function."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 55 This Committee will also be in contact with the Chairman of the Grand L odge Endowment Fund Committee and see that the Lodg e membership is informed of ma tters he desires called to their attention, and assist in every wa y in building up the Endowment Fund. THE GRAND LODGE SCHOL ARSHIP FOUNDATION In 1962 the Grand Lodge established a committee to administer a number of scholarships to deserving and able students in selected Ohio Coll eges, Universities and Th eological Seminaries. In 1965 the Grand Lodge established the Grand L odge of Free and Accepted Masons of Ohio Scholarship Foundation, tax-exempt foundation to r eceive gifts and monies with which to fund the scholarship program. The Grand Lodge Scholarship has recently un dergone a major reorganization. There is now one $2000 scholarship available to each Distri ct. Applications for these scholarships are available from the District Deputies, who are also responsible for establishing a District Selection Committee. The District Selec tion Committee sends it s recommendations on to the Grand Lodge Scholarship Committee, which ma kes the final selections. Lodges and members are encouraged to cont ribute to the Scholarsh ip Foundation. Many Lodges have adopted the practice of making a memo rial contribution to the Scholarship Foundation in the name of a deceased member in lieu of sending a floral emblem. Contributions may be sent directly to: The Scholarship Foundation, the Grand Lodge of F.& A.M. of Ohio, P.O. Box 629, Worthington, Ohio 43085. THE GRAND LODGE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION This Foundation was founded in 1994, during the te rm of Grand Master Thomas D. Zahler.

Well over $100,000 is contributed each year by Lodges and Brethren who hold special dinners and other events to raise money. At one time, it required $30 to “sponsor an athlete” to the Summer Games in Co lumbus. Now, it costs a bout $80 to bring each athlete to the Games.

MASONIC MODEL STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM The Grand Lodge of Ohio has sponsored Ma sonic Model workshops for more than ten years. These three-day training sessions for teache rs and other school personnel are intended to increase their skills at identifying “at risk” students in the classroom and intervening in their lives before the student can become a di sruptive force in school or society. Ohio is one of 27 states whose Grand Lodges are part of the Ma sonic Foundation for Children, which provides the instructors and expertise for the program. Since the workshops were initiated in Ohio, more than 1500 teachers from 236 schools have been tr ained. The Ohio Department of Education now recommends the Masonic Model program. The costs of the program are born e by the Grand Lodge of Ohio, and in the future, it is hoped that they can be paid from the Grand L odge Charitable Foundation. Until the Foundation’s Endowment Fund grows enough for that, the Grand Lodge finances the program from its operating budget. Contributions to the Grand Lodge Charitable Foundation will help to fund this worthwhile effort in the future. A Lodge or group of Lodges can sponsor a program in a local school district. GEORGE WASHINGTON MASO NIC NATIONAL MEMORIAL This monument, located atop Shoot er’s Hill in Alexandr ia, Virginia, is not only a tribute to a great Masonic patriot and states man, Worshipful Brother George Washington, but serves as a symbol of Masonry’s nationwide devotion to the pr inciples upon which our country was established and under which Masonry flourishes.

GRAND LODGE DISTRICT ADVISOR The Grand Master appoints a District Advisor in each District to co-ordinate the workings of a District. This Brother is norma lly a Past District Deputy Grand Ma ster or a Past Grand Master. The District Advisor meets with the present and past District Depu ties in the District periodically to discuss various concerns and activities in the District. He recommends the appointment and reappointment of District Deputy Grand Masters to the Grand Master. GRAND LODGE OFFICERS Each Deputy Grand Master at the time of hi s Installation as Grand Master, appoints 3 new and 3 continuing Brothers as Grand Lodge Officers. They are the Junior and the Senior Grand Deacons, Grand Marshal, Grand Orator , Grand Chaplain and Grand Tyler. The Junior Grand Deacon is a Brother who the new Grand Master feels will serve the Grand Lodge with enthusiasm and dedication for th e next seven years and if deemed worthy by the Brethren, be elected and serve as Grand Master. He must be a Past Master and is usually a present or past District Deputy Grand Master. Each incoming Grand Master reviews the accomplishments and service of the Brother and determines if he should be appointed to the next Office. The Grand Chaplain may be any Brother and need not be a minister or other ordained religious leader and serves only one year as a Grand Lodge Officer. He is given the title of Right Worshipful even if he has not served as a Dist rict Deputy. Upon his reti rement from Office, he becomes an Associate Grand Chaplain. The Grand Tyler serves for one year and has the title of Right Worshipful even if he has not served as a District Deputy a nd upon his retirement is recogn ized as a Past Grand Tyler. The Junior Grand Deacon is normally appoint ed to the Office of Senior Grand Deacon, then Grand Marshal, followed by Grand Orator. These appointments are the prerogative of the incoming Grand Master who may or may not appoint th e Brother to the next Office. Just as in a Lodge, progression to the next Office is depend ant on a Brother’s performance in his present Office. Traditionally, the Grand Orator, if found worthy, is elected to the Offi ce of Junior Grand Warden and then to Senior Grand Warden, Deputy Grand Master and finally, to Grand Master.
