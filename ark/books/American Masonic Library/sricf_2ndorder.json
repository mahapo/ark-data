In the grade of Zelator you were recommended to study the powers and properties of Numbers, and the philosophy of the Hebrew Kabalah, in which the relations between Numbers, Letters, Words and Things are defined In the Grade of Theoricus, the mysteries of Nature, of mineral, vegetable and animal life are proper 10 Ii"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"studies, and its ritual of admission teaches you that beyond the colours, as well as the forms of oblects, there are occult relations which need investigation The Giade of Practicus has special relation to the ancient art of Alchymy and the modern science and art of Chemistry. And lastly, the Grade of Philosophus teaches the need of the highest mental culture in order to com - prehend the works of the philosophers, and the sacred volumes of the World-Religions. The Theology of the Chzistian Church suggests a study of the older Jewish Faith, and this leads to researches into the pagan beliefs and rhe realms of Greco-Roman mythology, also into the religions of Ancient Egypt and the great Asiatic Faiths, Bud - dhism, Brahmanism and Mohammedanism Your studies in the First Order, then, have been so extensive in order to give you broad views of human knowledge, life and duty, and your reception into Adeptship introduces you into a new status—that of the Teacher, and be assured, my Very Worthy Frater, that your long probation and extensive tuition have not been only for your own benefit. Your studies have been directed and your mind well stored with science, and your hands well tiained in art, in order that you might teach others. What you have received, that freely give. Know then, Frater, that in the First Order you are learners, in the Second Order you are Teachers, while in the Third Order you may become Rulers,—Magi, or Magistri The Right Worthy Inductor has conferred upon you trie Sign, Grip, and Word of the Grade of Adeptus Minor. The Adept Grades have their own jewel, which is a triangular plate of gold, an equilateral and equiangular triangle, suspended by a golden chain or a ribbon of yellow colour. Upon its face is engraved the Tetractys—..so called of Pythagoras, the famous Greek philosopher of Crotona, who lived about 520 B c This consisted of ten stars, which were in later times ieplaced by ten Yods, or Jods, the Chaldee, or Hebrew letter corresponding to the English I or Y. These were arranged in four rows of 1, 2, 3, and 4, so as to be seen also as four rows in the aliernative position. The Yod was considered as the Sacred Symbol of God In Hebrew numera - tion Yod was the number Ten, called the Decad by ancient philosophers, and in this figure the Decad is considered as composed of— One Yod referring to God, Unity, the Monad; Two Yods referring to jJFI, Jah; As above, so beJ ow; the Dyad, Matter; Three Yods referring to l1-{V, Adam, Seth and Enoch; and later the Trinity of the Chris - tian Faith’ and Four Yods referring to lHVI-I,—the Tetra - grasninaton, becoming INRI in the Chris - tian symbolism Around this figure of the Tetractys are spaces in which the names and numbers of the Three Grades can be engraved. On the reverse side are the words— Soc. Rosic. in C. F.; around this are placed the 12 13"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"owner’s initials, and his motto, and upon the third space are engraved the Divine initials IHVH and INRI. The Decad was called the emblem of the Universe. If we further consider the Decad of the Tetractys of Pythagoras in the light of the Hebrew Kabalah, and according to the numerical values of the Hebrew letters, we shall find that the important symbolic number, Seventyiwo, is produced. I, Yod, alone is ten; Yod, Heh, IH is ten and five, that is fifteen. Yod, Heh, Vau, THy, is ten, five and six, that is twenty-one Yod, Heh, Vau, Heh, IHVH, is ten, five, six, five, that is twenty-six The total is seventy- two, the number of steps of the Ladder of Jacob which reached from earth to heaven; upon each step, says the Talmud, was an Angel bearing one of the names of God. These names are derived from the words and letters of the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first verses of the fourteenth chapter of the book of Exodus, and to each name is added the angelic title of AL or AH as a termination. In medi~val magic these 72 Angelic Names were en - graved on 36 Talismans, and were used for divina - tion and protection. The Seventy-two lettered Divine Name was called the Shemhamphorash. The number 72 is also the numeration of the name Chesed, CHSD, 8, 60, 4, which signifies Mercy, it is one of the Divine attributes of the Ten Holy Sephiroth. As has been already stated, the work of the Adepts is that of Tuition as well as self improvement. As an Adeptus Minor it is your special duty to teach the Zelatots and the Fratres of the grade of Theoricus, while in the College ceremonials you should be at all times able and willing to perform the duties of an Ancient. You may feel well assured, my Frater, that the most sure way to fix any knowledge in the memory is to practice the art of teaching that knowledge to others who are seeking to teach your own stage of progress.

Frater: As you have now been duly received into the Sixth Grade of the Rosicrucian Society, which is the Second Grade of Adeprship of the Second Order, let me congratulate you upon Ihe progress you have made, and also upon your Reception by ihe Adepti Majores in College assembled. The special duties of our ancient Fratres in this gr.ade were the teaching and guidance of the Practici of the Society, the performance of experiments in physical science and researches into the relations existing between minerals, metals, and their com - pounds In addition to these duties, an Adeptus Major was instructed to devote great attention to Contemplation upon serious subjects, and was taught that great powers are to be gained by Mental Concentration, the ‘Yoga’ of Hindoo philosophy Each Adept should make a solemn study of himself, observing the mental and moral failings which beset him, and should endeavor to cultivate and strengthen those faculties which he finds to be lacking in develop - ment, so that he may become daily more fit to com bat the world, the flesh and the devil, and be better prepared to lie down in death when the summons of the Great King shall call him to cease his work in this world The life of an Adept, well spent in thought, word and deed, should provide a fitting preparation for a calm repose The Secret Words of this grade — are intended to provide a bridle to your tongue, a guaidian to your mind, and a tutor to your passions. These Secret Words should form the text of your self-communings, and also a ladder by which youi thoughts may pass from your duties as a man to your privileges as a spiritual Ego. It may well be that, with the casting aside of your material body, you may in another sphere of being attain more extensive perceptions, and the power of communi - cation with other beings without the need of speech and the organs of hearing and sight. The Ego robed only in a tenuous garment of ether may well possess the longed -for clair-audience and clairvoyance which the Mystics have so earnestly sought for by means of the mortification of the flesh and aspirations after the Divinity It being our duty to remember that death must come to us sooner or later, and may come to any one of us to-day, it is fitting that my address should refer to the great change. Death is the end of Life, and a well-spent life ends in a peaceful and happy death, the mind calm and the conscience unclouded By “I,~’ “Thou,” or “He,” we mean the thinker dwelling in a material body, death is the separation of the Thinker, which philosophers call the Ego, from its body, from its garments which have been soiled by age, by use or by abuse. Self preservation is said to be the first law of nature, and it seems true to say that a natural death only occurs when it is no longer physically avoid- 22 23"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"able, it does not take place so long as the body is perfect enough to form the dwelling of the Vital Force, and to confine the Life Essence. The Christian Faith teaches that our lives are periods of probation, and that when a life has been ended the body returns to the earth and the Soul to God, Who gave it According to the Roman Catholic Faith the Soul at death goes to a place of Purgatory, for all souls have sinned and need some punishment, and then to a final Judgment when eternal happiness or misery will be allotted. The Reformed or Prorestant faith teaches also the coming of a Great Day of Judgment, but does not definitely specify the condition or place of abode of Souls after death and before judgment. Almost all the ancient nations held the doctrine of successive lives, and did not grant the creation of a new soul for each new personality born. Many old religions taught that Reincarnation was universal, and that each life was a result of the actions and experiences of a previous life,—while acknowledging that great wickedness might cause the complete loss of a soul, and that sublime purity when attained led to absorption into the Divinity from which all souls emanate. The ancient Hebrews had no ideal of immortal life in joy or punishment, the medi~val Rabbis taught that souls passed through many existences; so also did the Mysteries of Egypt, the Olympic religion of the Greeks, the Roman cultus, and the great religions of lndia—Brahmanism and Buddhism. There is very little trace in Latin literature that the Romans feared death, any more than the Turks, Chinese, and Japanese of our own times The Roman softened the notion of Death, he avoided saying mortuus est, but said vzxzt, he did live, or fuit, he was. The sudden death of a man they ascribed to Apollo, the Sun God, who withdrew the Vitality he had given, of a woman they referred to Diana as a Moon goddess, more nearly related to the feminine type. There is an idea still commonly believed in that has come down to us fiom the earliest times, that at the point of Death a man has a mental vision. or review of the course of his past life It is an awful thought Let us all then, so live our lives that this Spectre of Life may but little distress us. The cQnsciousness of a life well spent is of itself a crown of reward The last end of a man who has passed his days in selfish enjoyment or in mortal sin must indeed be haunted by the ghost of his sordid joys and poisoned feasts. Let us strain every nerve to obey the Divine Law, and to love our neighbors as ourselves: such precepts are of universal application; against such there is no law The body we live in should be respected and preserved in health so far as possible, we are sent here to live out our lives, not to destroy them; in life only can we learn by experience, and so progress along the uphill path to perfection. There is no progress to be made in the grave, so work while it is yet day. As we sow, so we 24 25"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"shall also reap,—for the night cometh when no man can work. How excellent it is to spend a long life well, to travel a long and arduous life journey, and then to fall asleep in death, as if falling asleep from fatigue. For the aged, the final scene is often brief, and the act of dying almost imperceptible. At such a time the vivid remembrance of a well-spent lifc full of benevolent self-sacrifice and zealous endeavor to do the right must tend to the attainment of the Beatific Vision. Let us endeavor, then, to live so as to have no fear of Death; holding such doctrines as these, to confess to a fear of d~eath is to confess to an ill - spent life.

The grade of Adeptus Exemptus completes the Second Order of the Rosicrucran Society, and in the name of all ihe Adepti I congratulate you Frater on having attained to the Crown of Adeptship, but I also entreat you to continue to pursue your siudies and your duties with fervency and zeal Never be weary of well doing, always strive to excel yourself rn all your works, and so it may be that in due course of time you may receive from our Most Worthy Supreme Magus the call to advance into the ruling order of our Society, for the path to the Grade of Magisrer lies always open to the Frater who possesses courage and endurance, if he will add to these virtues enthusiasm in the perform - ance of his work, and an orderly submission to the behests of the Magi who govern our ancient and honourable Society Yes, my Frater, the Path is always open, but it leads upward all the way, and it is still beset with temptations to turn aside the pilgrim who is seeking the Infinite As an Adeptus Exemptus your special care is to guide the studies of the Philosophi who are expected to consider not only the Christian writings, and to follow the behests of Jesus Who was the Christ, but also to search out and endeavor to comprehend the doctrines of the great World-Religions which preceded Christianity, and still continue to supply a rule of conduct to many millions of our fellow men An attentive study of the Faiths of the World will lead to the discovery that in all of them may be 32 found high moral teachings, although overlaid by many strange superst~tions, much superfluous oriental imagery, and errors due to the ignorance of the times in which they weie founded. The srudy of Comparative Religions will explain to a large extent the differing characters of the world’s inhabi - tants The fanatic valour of the Arab and the Turk have been stimulated by the Faith of Mohammed. Brahmin theology compels the use of endless cere - monials and ablutions, while in China the teaching of Confucius leads to lives of passive endurance The Christian Religion of Western Europe for fifteen hundred years required implicit obedience to the faith as crystalized in the Church of Rome. This system prevailed at the time of the passing away of our Founder, Christian Rosenkreuz, in 1484. One hundred and thirty years later, when the “Fama’ and “Confessia”, which narrated the history of the foundation of the Society of Rosicrucrans, were first printed and published in 1614, the Reformation had been accomplished Preachers of the Reformed Faith taught the right and duty of all men to read the Bible for themselves, and to guide their conduct by the teachings of Jesus as recorded in the New Tesrament. The Frattes of the Rosicriicran Society have at all times professed the Christian Faith, and rn our Socretas Rosicruciana in C.F. of to-day we receive only Christian Masonic Brethren. It should be borne in mind that Freemasonry, as a Speculative Society, when it arose from the more 33"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"purely Operative Guilds, was in England at first a Christian Fraternity, and that it was not until the Duke of Sussex became sole Grand Master in 1813, that the basis of English Freemasonry was made Theistic. Its basis was thus widened to extend its usefulness, not only in England, but also to its Colonies which were then beginning to be numerous and important. Since that event some National Masonic bodies have excluded all references to a Supreme Being—the “Grand Orient of France” for example,—and so the Rosicrucian Society cannot admit Freemasons who hold Certificates from such Masonic Jurisdictions. The duty of an Adeptus Exemptus is not only to assist in the teaching of the Philosophi, but also to supervise the Adepts of the two lower grades, in - structing them by converse and example how to rule and govern their lives so as to live respected, and die full of honour and good works You, my newly received Adeptus Exemptus, have so lately passed through the Ceremony in which you stood beside the symbolic grave, that your thoughts must turn quite naturally to the Hereafter, and you are seeking to know the nature of the staic or condition in which the disembodied soul may awake, and to peer into the great darkness which overshadows our latter end. As a Christian the teachings of other faiths seem less true than the glimpses of futurity which our own Sacred Writings provide: As a Christian you know that it is not given to man to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom of God.” As St Paul said—now we 34 see through a glass darkly, but then face to face~ To the faithful Christian our Divine Master said— ‘In My Father’s house are many mansions, I go to prepare a place for you)’ The condition of the human soul immediately after death is hiddcn from our view, and so it is of no value to contrast the various arguments in favour of Purgatory or of Reincarnation So also it is equally futile to discuss whether there will be an immediate judgment upon each one, or a single final judgment for all. Let us love God and act justly by all men, let us study nature, let us teach as well as learn, let us be merciful as we hope for mercy, and by so doing prepare to close our eyes in death when our life’s work is done, calm in the dignity of our manhood, assured of the beneficence of God our Father, and trusting in ihe promise of our Great Master, Jesus the Christ We are Fratres Ros~e et Crucis,—so let us remem - bet the Rose as a symbol of the Divine Spirit within us, and the Cross as an emblem of self-sacrifice and high endeavor. md.
