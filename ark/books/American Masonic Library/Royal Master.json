A representation of the Cherubim should be formed by the use of nine standards, each with a burning taper, connected by silk rope enclosing the altar with an opening in the south. In the north east corner of the room there should be a table on which are several articles as described in Kings I, verses 48-50 and a trestle board on which are several geometric designs. HA is at work there as the degree opens. Candles on the table remain lighted throughout the entire first section. House lights are dimmed throughout first section. Each of the three GMs should have a pede stal with a lighted candle upon it. All three are at their stations when the class is brought in. HA remains there until after the prologue. Aprons should not be worn over robes, except HA, who puts his on after repairing to the northeast corner. When all is ready the CC will conduct th e candidates into the Council chamber and seat them on the south side of the room east of the CC station. CC assumes station and is seated. All candidates should wear white aprons. Only one active candidate should be used. The IM may give the prologue, or it can be done by another companion. Prol I will take a moment at this time to explain to you in my own words, the setting of this “The Royal Master Degr ee” and its officers so you may better understand the work. I represent Solomon, King of Israel, on my right is Hiram, King of Tyre and on my left is Hiram Abiff. The station in the west is known as the Captain of the Guard. In the south is the Conductor of the Council. The Steward and Sentinel complete the Officers that work in the degree. The three roughens are to remind you of the Master Mason degree. The alter is distinguished with the nine standards to represent the Sanctum Sanitarium into which we learned in the 3 rd degree that Hiram Abiff entered t offer up his adorations to Deity. As th e work begins, Hiram Abiff will take his place at the Trestle Board. Companions, you have repeatedly been informed that Masonry is a never- ending search for light. In the Craft degrees you received light, more light and further light, but your search w as note ended. In the Chapter degrees additional light was imparted to you, and you found, as you find in life, that each advancement in knowledge simply opens the eyes to a vaster field of knowledge yet to be attained. Every revealment in Masonry is also a reveilment. Every discovery of new truths also reveals a veil in front of some other truth, to be again the object of further search. Ultimate Truth will be discovered only when we have passed the final veil and entered into the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ro yal Master 2 10/ 30/ 05 presence of Him who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In taking our degrees there is one thing you must remember, namely, the order in which events happen is seldom the order in which we learn about them. The successive degrees in Masonry picture events in the order we learn abut them, not the chronological order in which they occurred. For instance, the events of the Mark Master degree took place before those of the Master Mason degree, but they were not prese nted to you in that order. The degree you are about to receive pictures eve nts that happened prior to and after the tragedy of the third degree, and we wo uld have you notice how well they fill the gaps in our knowledge of that tragedy and its meaning. In this degree you, as a candidate, will represent Adoniram, one of the most skilled of the craftsmen employed by King Solomon at the building of the Temple, who was a close personal frien d of the Grand Master Hiram Abiff. Lights are dimmed. KS Companion CG (CG rises) see that the candidate is prepared and presented. CG Retires with K to the prep room and pr epares him by divesting him of his coat and rolling up his sleeves, clothes him in an apron as a Fellowcraft and places a beautiful piece of work in his hands. This piece of work should be a miniature representation of the three lesser lights, which can actually be lighted. As K is taken out, HA leaves his station, goes to table in the northeast corner, puts on his apron and is working there as CG and K enter. CG takes K by the right arm. They enter without an alarm and pass directly to the northeast corner of the room where HA stands at the table examining the Holy Vessels. The K now represents the character Adoniram. KS Holding up the piece of work. My Illustrious Companion Hiram Abiff, this is a piece of work which I myself gave orders to be made, and which, I observe, has been executed according to my command. It is intended to serve as a reminder of the mysterious triad, expressive of the essence and attributes of Deity and of those great Masonic virtues – Faith, Hope, and Charity. You will deposit it in the Holy of Holies, with the other sacred furniture, and here after, in every Regular Masonic Lodge, let there be displayed about the Altar of Obligation, three burning tapers, placed in a triangular position; and may the virtues which they symbolize, be a light unto the feet of every true and fait hful Mason, in all walks of life, until that perfect day when the glory of the Lord shall illumine our souls forever.

When HA starts for the Altar, CG & K turn west, timing to speech, stop directly north of Altar, faces south and says “to enter” just as HA enters from the south. CG It is now high twelve, at which hour it is the custom of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff to enter the Sanctum Sanctorum and offer up his devotions to Deity. HA Kneels at Altar and prays: Let me do my work each day and if the darkened hours of despair overtake me, may I not forget the strength that comforted me in the sadness of other times. May I still remember the bright hours that found me walking over the silent hills of my childhood or dreaming on the margin of the quiet river, when a light glowed with in me and I promised my early God to have courage amid the tempest of the changing years. Spare me from bitterness and from the sharp passions of unguarded moments. Though the world know me not, may my thoughts and actions be such as shall keep me friendly with myself. Lift my ey es from the earth and teach me the uses of the stars. Forbid that I should judg e others lest I condemn myself. Let me not follow the glamour of the world but walk calmly in my path. Give me a few friends, who will love me for what I am and not for what little I may possess. And though age and infirmity overtake me and I come not within sight of the castle of my dreams, tech me still to be thankful for life and for time’s olden memories that are good and sweet, and may the evening’s twilight find me gentle still.

The young may die, the old must die, and the wisest knoweth not how soon. There is none that escapes the inexorable doom. The youngest EA upon the checkered pavement below dwells ever in shadow of death, while the invisible hand extends equally above KS on his ivory throne. We walk upon the ashes of the generati ons who have gone this way before us, to which our ashes must in turn contribute.

The teeming brain, the skillful hand and the sinewy arm are alike useless and superfluous in the grave. As our Most Excellent King Solo mon has said, “The dead know not anything; their love, their hatred and their envy is no perished; neither have they any more a portion forever of anything that is done under the sun.” What an incentive is this to an industrious use of our time and our faculties, that we "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ro yal Master 5 10/ 30/ 05 should build industriously while our strength endures and labor to complete our work ere the week closes and the Sabbath of Eternity sets in.

"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Royal M aster 13 10/ 30/ 05 Historical Lecture This degree originated in consequence of a conversation between Grand Master Hiram Abiff and Adoniram, just before the death of the former. After the Sanctum Sanctorum was completed, and a portion of the furniture deposited therein, Adoniram, on a certai n day near high twelve, went there to deposit one of the Holy Vessels. At high twelve, when the craft were called from labor to refreshment, Adoniram did not retire with the rest, but lingered behind with Hiram Abiff, whose custom it was at that hour to enter the Sanctum Sanctorum and offer his devotions to Deity and to draw designs upon the Trestle Board. After the rest of the Craft had retired, Ad oniram asked Hiram Abiff when he should receive the Master’s Word. He answered, “I do not know that you will ever receive it, for it is agreed by Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram King of Tyre and myself that the Master’s Word can only be given when the Temple is completed, and then only in the presence of all three.” Adoniram then said, “Suppose one of you three, even you yourself should be removed by death prior to that event, how then shall I receive it?” After commenting on the subject of death, Hiram Abiff with a significant gesture replied, “If I die, it will be buried there.” This conversation having been related to King Solomon by Adoniram, the Master’s Word was deposited in the Secret Vault, as will be more fully explained to you in the succeeding degree, to which this is a preparatory. After the untimely death of Grand Master Hiram Abiff, the two surviving Grand Masters instituted this degree of Royal M aster in token of their respect for his memory, and as a partial substitute for th e Master Mason degree. Being unable to form the triangle in giving the Master’ s Word, as one of their number was dead, they substituted the broken triangle, bein g the nearest they could come to the original. They first conferred the degree upon the noble Adoniram, and then upon other particular friends of Hiram Abiff. As his friend we now confer it upon you, and we give it as illustrative of the M aster Mason and Royal Arch degrees. The furniture of the Sanctum Sanctorum consisted of many Holy Vessels made of pure gold, but the most important article there was the Ark of the Covenant, called the Glory of Israel, which was seated in the midst of the Holy Place under the wings of the Cherubim. It was a small chest, or coffer, three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide and deep. It was made of wood excepting only the mercy seat, but overlaid with gold; both inside and out. It had a ledge of gold surrounding it at the top, into which the cover, called the mercy seat was let in. The mercy seat was of solid gold, the thickness of a hand’s breadth. At the two ends of it were two Cherubs, looking inward toward each other, with their wings extended; which, embracing the whole circum ference of the mercy seat, met on each side in the middle; all of which, the Rabbis say, was made out of the same mass without any soldering of parts. Here the Shekina, or Divine Presence, rested and was visible in the appearance of a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Royal Master 14 10/30/05 cloud over it. From hence the Bathkol issued, and gave answers when God was consulted. And hence it is that God is said in the Scriptures to dwell between the Cherubim; that is between the Cherubim on the mercy seat, because there was the Seat or Throne of the visible presence of His Glory among them. IM This concludes the degree of Royal Master. You will now retire with your conductor, while necessary preparation is made for the succeeding degree. CC Leas the candidates to the west of the al tar, where they receive the Prologue. Prologue Companions: The degree you have just received was preparatory to the one that is to follow, but the events it pictures occurred prior to those of the Third Degree and those of the Royal Master. As a candidate in the various Masonic de grees, you represented a seeker for Truth symbolized by the Master’s Word. In the craft degrees this Word was lost when it seemed almost attained. You were given a sub stitute with the hope that the true one would be recovered. You again became a seeker for the Word, and in the Chapter degrees it was found. Then the question arose: How was it thus preserved, and how came it to be in the place where you found it? In the Royal Master degree you had the definite assurance, not given in the Thir d Degree, that it would be preserved, and you were given a hint as to where it would be buried. In the degree you are about to receive, you will learn how and why it was buried there. In the Select Master degree, Hiram Abiff is still alive and the three original Grand Masters are the principle characters in the scenes portrayed. You, as a candidate, will represent Zabud, who was the sone of Nathan, and a very close personal friend of King Solomon. CC Leads the class in giving the signs, IM re sponds.
