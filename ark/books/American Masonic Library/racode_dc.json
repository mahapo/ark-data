The ballot shall be taken for the degrees collectively. If only one black cube appears, the ballot shall be immediately re taken. If a black cube again appears, no further ballot can be taken for the applicant for 3 months, and then only if a new petition is received and acted upon, as in the case of a first petition. In balloting on a petition for affiliation, if only one black cube appears, a ballot shall be immediately retaken. If a black cube again appears, the pet itioner shall be declared rejected, but he may at once petition to another Chapter or may again petition t he same Chapter, if its bylaws permit. Sec. 103. Petitions for the degrees and for a ffiliation or reinstatement, after they have been received by a majority vote, must be referred to a committee of 3 members of the Chapter and lie over at least 2 weeks, unless by dispensation of the Grand High Priest such period is shortened. Sec. 104.

Each petition shall be balloted upon within 3 months after it is re ceived, unless the time is extended by dispensation of the Grand High Priest, but not until at least 2 members of the investigating committee shall have reported on it. Sec. 106. Petitions for the degrees sha ll not be received from anyone who has not been a resident of the District of Colu mbia for the 12 months preceding its presentation; except by dispensation of the Grand High Priest. Dispensation is not required in case of a petition presented under the provisions of Section 96. If the petitioner is from a jurisdiction which claims personal jurisdiction, his petition must be accompanied by a waiver. If he has been rejected for the degrees in another jurisdiction, his petition must be accompanied by a release of jurisdiction from that jurisdiction, unless the period for which ju risdiction is claimed has expired. The masonic residence of a man in the military service of the United States may be either his residence or the place where he is stationed. Sec. 107. A candidate who is rejected by a C hapter may submit a new petition to that Chapter, or another Chapter, after 2 months, so long as the new petition includes the information that the candidate was previ ously rejected by another Chapter.

If upon submission of this application for the remaining degree or degrees, a of the members present vote to sustain the objection, the status shall be the same as upon the vote on the committee report on the matter, and so for all like applications. Unless the vote to sustain the objection stands as provided in this section, the remaining degree or degrees may be conferred. Sec. 110. If a Companion of another Chapter than the one in which a brother has been elected to receive the degrees knows of any valid reason why the candidate should not receive the Capitular degrees, he may state that in writing, to the Secretary of the Chapter in which the elec tion was had.

An application for a demit shall be in writing, addressed to the Chapter, and signed by the Companion making the applicat ion. If he is clear on the books, and no charges have been or are about to be pref erred against him, the demit shall be granted.

No Chapter shall admit to affiliation, however, one who has been dropped from another Chapter for nonpayment of dues and has not canceled such indebtedness. A Companion in arrears to an extinct Chapter must pay such arrearages to the Grand Chapter having juri sdiction thereof before he can affiliate with a Chapter in this Jurisdiction.

A Companion residing in another jurisdiction who is a member in good standing in this jurisdiction may become by affiliation a member of a Chapter in such other jurisdiction under like conditions and restrictions as herein indicated, if the laws of said other jurisdiction permit dual membership. Sec. 113. A petition for affiliation by a Co mpanion residing in a jurisdiction where dual membership is not permitted must be accompanied by a demit or equivalent certificate from the Chapter in which t he Companion last held membership, if such Chapter is in existence, or if not in exist ence, by a certificate from the Grand Chapter of the jurisdiction under which the exti nct Chapter existed. When a Companion becomes a member of the Chapter to whic h he has petitioned, the Secretary of that Chapter shall notify the Chapter granting the demit, or equiva lent certificate, of the Companion's election to membership.

If the ballot on his petition should be unfavorable, he retains his membership in the first Chapter. A certificate issued to a companion desiring to transfer his membership as herein provided shall be void if not pres ented to another Chapter within 2 months from the date it is issued. If favorable ac tion is not taken within 3 months from the date of the certificate, the petitioner shall still be a member of the original Chapter and chargeable with dues therein.
