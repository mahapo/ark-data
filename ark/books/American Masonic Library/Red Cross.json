After the death of Cyrus, the Jews, whom he liberated and sent back to Jerusalem, were forbidden by Cambyses, his son and successor, to continue the work of rebuilding, and at the time this Council was convened the work had ceased during several years.

Prince Chancellor, wait are you prepared to maintain your opinion by argument? If so, begin. PC Rises and bows to SM, faces the audience: O ye Princes and Rulers, how exceedingly strong is wine. It causeth all men to err that drink it; it maketh the mind of the King and the beggar to be all one; of the bondman and the freeman; of the poor man and the rich; it turneth also every thought into jollity and mi rth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt; it changeth and elevateth the spirits and eliveneth the heavy hearts of the miserable. It maketh a man forget his brethren and draw his sword against his best friends. O ye Pr inces and Rulers, is not Wine the strongest that forceth us to do these things? SM Prince Chancellor, your argument is well chosen. Prince Master of the Palace ( wait ) are you prepared to defend your position? PMP Rises and bows to SM, faces the audience: It is beyond dispute, Oh Princes and Rulers, that God has made man master of all things under the sun; to command them, to make use of them, and apply them to his service as he pleases; but whereas men have only dominion over other sublunary creatures, Kings have an authority even over men themselves, and a right of ruling them by will and pleasure. Now, he that is master of those who are masters of all things else, hath no earthly thing above his. SM Prince Master of the Palace, your argu ment is both pleasing and forcible, being well calculated to maintain the dignity of the throne. And now, Prince Z, we will hear the reason for your opinion and for the important addition you have made to our question. Z Rises and bows to SM, faces the audience: O Princes and Rulers, the force of Wine is not to be denied; neither is that of Kings, that unites so many men in on e common bond of allegiance; but the super eminency of Woman is yet above all this; for Kings are but the gifts of Women, and they are also the mothers of those that cultivate our vineyards. Women have the power to make us aband on our very country and relations, and many times to forget the best friends we have in the world, and forsaking all other comforts, to live and die with them. But when all is said, neither they, nor Wine, nor Kings, are comparable to the almighty force and of TRUTH. As for all other things, they are mortal and transient, but TRUTH alone is unchangeable and everlasting; the benefits we receive from it are subject to no variations or vicissitudes of time or fortune. In her judgment is no unrighteousness, and she is the strength wisdom, power, and majesty of all ages. BLESSED BE THE GOD OF TRUTH!
