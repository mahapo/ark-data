Soy. I shall now confide to you the mys - teries of our Order, The passwords which you have already heard are and ; the ini - tials you behold on the standard are those of the mystic words, “ In Hoc Signo Vinces.” The grand and ineffable word is ——, signifying the Ascension or Triumph of our Lord. It was also the name of King Solomon’s l~*~*~’~ of on Mount Lebanon, and was adopted by the College of Architects at Rome as the word of their degree, so as to perpetuate his name forever. This word must never be pro - nounced until you have received the most con - vincing proofs, by grip and sign, that the Brother is entitled to receive it. The first sign is to place the ~ ~ with the **li** in the form of a square over the ~ ~ as if to ~ it, to which a Knight Companion of the Order replies by placing the two *****~* of the ~ ~*~* on his lips; this forms the complete sign, and indicates the penalties of your obligation, the first sign alluding to dark - ness and the second referring to silence. The grip is given by each Knight Companion (in this manner) and giving the . . grip with both hands, thus forming a double triangle. I will now explain the method of proving a Companion of this Order, and the Sir Knight Prefect will instruct you how to proceed. What is this? Ans. The grip of a perfect Knight Mason. Soy.

Our Or - der is, therefore, not only the most ancient, but the most honorable institution of Christian Knighthood recorded in the pages of history, and it behooves us, beloved Sir Knights, to prize the privileges which we have obtained as the descendants of these worthy men, ever remembering the watchwords of our Conclave— Faith, Unity and Zeal.” Before proceeding to relate the circumstance of Constantine’s conversion, which produced such momentous results, I may first observe that in tracing the influence of this great event upon the world in general, it is more particularly our duty, as Masons, to remember that our Royal Founder had been, at an early period of his life, initiated into the mysteries of the “Collegium Artificum “ at Rome, and had attained the position of Magister, or Master, of the College 01 Architects; and it was doubtless this early training which had sufficiently enlightened his mind to perceive the errors and absurdities of pagan - ism, and cause him to early desire a more complete knowledge of the unknown deity woishipped in those ancient mysteries When he arrived at the Imperial dignity, not even the cares of empire nor the respon - sibilities of command could erase those ideas, or re - strain’ his profound reseatches after truth and wisdom. The manner of his conversion is thus related: One evening, the army being on its march toward Rome Constantine—reflecting upon the fate of sublunary things and the dangers 01 his approaching expedition, and sensible of his own incapacity to succeed without Divine assistance—meditating, also, upon the various religious opinions which then divided mankind—sent up his ejaculations to Heaven for inspiration and wis - dom to chose the right path to be pursued. The 0 A. of the U. heard his prayer, for as the sun was declin - ing, there suddenlyappeared a pilisi of light in the heav - ens, in the shape of a cross, with this inscription “In hoc signo vinces “—In this sign thou shalt conquer So extraordinary an appearance created the utmost astonishment in the mind of the Emperor and his whole army. The Pagans deemed it a most inauspi - cious omen, but Constantine, being reassured by the visions of the night, at dawn of day caused a royal standard to be made like that which he had seen in the heavens, and commanded it to be carried before him in his wars es an ensign of victory and celestial protection. Several Christian Masons among the sol - diers, no longer fearing persecution, then came for- RED + ORDER. 13 ward to avow their faith, and the Emperor, in order to commemorate the event, directed them to wear upon their armoi a red cross, with sixteen stars denoting the sixteen l~tters of the mystic words. On returning to his capital, Constantine, with the assistance of Eu - sebius, openhd a Conclave of Knights of this Order, and these ve’liant and illustrious men were ever after - ward the bodyguard of their sovereign. The rose and the lily were’ adopted by our Royal Founder as em - blems of th~ Divine Being he had learned to adore— mystically representing the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the ‘~‘alley. Among the acts of Constantine, his encouragement of learning is conspicuous; he commandedl the Scriptures to be carefully kept and frequently read in all churches; he also devoted the fourth part o~ his revenue toward the relief of the poor, and for other pious purposes. His tomb, of gray mar - ble, continu~s at Constantinople to this day, and even its present possessors retain a veneration Ior the mem - cry ot the illustrious Constantine. Three hundred years bad the persecution of our brethren continued when ii ceased with this great Emperor, who laid a lasting foundation for the honor of the Christian name. Upon this i~ccount his memory wIll flourish in the minds of all good men and Christian Masons until time shall be no moie The newly installed Knight then takes his seat as a memker.

We have unfurled to-day the banner of the Cross— the highest and holiest ensign ever lifted up for man to follow and revere. We bear aloft the standard of our illustrious founder, whereon is delineated a faint resemblance of the sacred vision of old which startled the solid phalanx of the Roman legion and bowed the heads of princes to the dust. With this divine symbol before us, the remote and marvelous past seems re - called from its shadowy grave. Again. “The Cross triumphant blazes in the sky,” its intluence as great, its inspiration as exalted, in our own day and generation, as when Constantine, clad in resplendent armor. charged at the head at hu warrior knights and routed the hosts of the tyrant. The labarum or device adopted by Constantine was a monogram of the Chi and the Rho—the first two letlers of Christos, in Greek char - acters. This emblem was placed on the battle-flags of the Roman Empire, and in after years the Red Cross Banner led to victory those pious champions of the Cross, who devoted their lives to the rescue of the Holy Land from its infidel oppressors. On this auspicious occasion, it may be deemed not inopportune briefly to consider the precepts that are taught. and the objects desired to be attained by all who have entered sincerely into communion with our Christian Order. Faith is the first principle inculcated—a belief in the Omnipotent Ruler of the Universe, the Sovereign Father, the Eternal God This belief, thro.ugh the in - fluence of the Spirit, teaches us to lake up the Cross and follow’the footsteps of the Lamb in perfect love and in implicit obedience to His divine will. By Ihese means alone we hope to rebuild in our hearts the mys - terious temple of the Triune God. Unity is the mighty chain by which we, as brethren, are bound together and enabled to achieve great things, It is the support and bond of friendship, the cement at brotherly love, the wondrous lever by which immortal Truth is raised out of the chasms of dark - ness, where error and superstition hold sovereign sway. Without unity we cannot become a happy and prosper - ous communily. Let us, therefore, strive to preserve this vital principle by being kind and forbearing to all, by forgiving injury and overlooking injusirce, by a readiness at all times to stretch forth a helping hand RED + ORDER 21’ to the unfortunate, to sorrow with those bvercome with grief, and to rejoice with those whose hearis are full of gladness Zeal is the grand permeating fire of the soul which stimulates our desires into action, and animates our labors. Without zeal, the potent thoughts of sages, the profound tdeas of philosophers, would remain in obscurity like the unhewn statue In the quarry; but kindled into light and tile by this o’ermastering spirrt, they assume shape and substance~ and ripen into glo - rious realities. Having thus directed your attention more particu - larly to the inward watchwords of our Conclave, I would further tinpress upon your minds that Charity and Truth are also essential attributes of the Order, and that we are bound to practice, in our daily life, the holy precepts taught by our Divine and Almighty Sov - ereign. Again, I would entreat you to guard well the vestibule 01 our temple, and suffer none to pass its sacred threshold but brethren faithful and true, whO have shown a Christian disposition toward their fellow- men, and whose future conduct, you feel assured, will reflect no discredit upon the Order. Finally, Sir Knights, let us ever be found In the straight paih of Integrity, Honor, Secrecy, and Vir - tue, wielding our mystic swords valiantly in spiritual warfare with sin, so that whon the pilgrimage of life is over, and the boundless shores of eternity dawn upon the soul, imperishable Faith may illumine the dark - ness ot death, and guide us to that celestial cor’iclavb of saints and angels, where the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley shall bloom tor everlasting in the presence of the Most High.

Then the Sir Knight Verger will conduct you round the Sanctuary, and during your progress you will be instructed in the three Theological Virtues which are the pillars of the New Law.

The Candidate is taken round and halts by the 1st column. “Faith.” The Sub-Prior then de - livers the 1st Theological Oration, riz.: K. H S. ORDER 35 Faith is a firm conviction of the existence and attributes of God, and produces in the mind perfect love and reverence for His name—a steadfast confidence of His word—an entire resignation and obedience to His will. If this faith be sincere, ii will become the great and master spring of all our actions, directing us to such a line of conduct as will be pleasing in the ,sight ot that God in whom we live, and move, and have our being. Faith thus exercised and exemplified in the actions of our lives leads us next to the acquirement of another virtue, whose influence, though not less powerful, is still more soothing to the soul; it leads us to that firm and steadfast Hope, which the storms of late can never shake, nor the terrors of death itself diminish or destroy. The Candidate is conducted to the 2d column or pillar of “Hope,” and the Prior proceeds To define the nature of Hope is a task al - most beyond the power of language or thought. It Is more than desire, greater than expecta - tion, beyond trust, superior to confidence, and when we speak of the Hope of eternal life,” surely no other term can adequately express the immortal feelings of the soul. This sacred hope, based on the pure and active principles of Faith, is the day-star of our youth—the comfort of our declining years, and the loving companion of our pilgrimage through this vale of tears, until the closing hour of life unveils to our view the mysteries of a boundless eternity. The Candidate is taken to the 3d pillar, Char - it)’.” and the Seneschal addresses him. Charity is that sacred virtue which inspires the breast with the spirit of universal benef - icence.

Be it known that in the year of our Lord, 326, Helena, daughter of Caylus, King of Britain, consort of Constantius, and mother of Constantine the Great, made a journey to the Holy Land in search of the cross of the Redeemer. After leveling the hillocks on Mount Calvary and destroying the Temple of Venus,~ three crosses were discovered, and it was difficult to determine which of the three had borne the bleeding form of the Lamb of God. The Pontiff, Marcellinus, being consulted, commanded them to be carried to the bedside of a woman who had long been visited by sick - ness and lay at the point of death, and their virtue and efficacy to be tested by placing her hands upon each’ of the crosses. The Pontiff’s orders were obeyed, and two of the crosses rendered her no service, but when her hand was laid upon the third, she was miraculously restored to health, and instantly arose, giving glory to God, saying: “He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with his stripes we are healed “ On the spot where the crosses were found, Helena and Constantine erected a stately church, one hun - dred paces long and sixty wide; the east end covers the place where the crucifixion took -7 ~v.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtinga2rgus.nl w.stichtinga2rgus.nl w.stichtinga2rgus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtinga2rgus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtinga2rgus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtinga2rgus.nl S"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"I w.stichtingargus.nl ~v.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargu s.n[ w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus .nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s .nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus.nI 40 K H S ORDER. place, and by leveling the hills, the Sepulchre is above the floor of the church, like a grotto, which is twenty feet from the floor to the top of the rock. There is a superb cupola over the Sepulchre, and in the aisle are the tombs of Godfrey and Baldwin, Kings of Jerusalem. Helena then, with the sanction of Constantine, instituted the Order of Knights of the Holy Sepulchre of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The Order was confirmed by the Pontiff, Mar - cellinus, and the Patriarch of the Holy City was appointed as Chief of the Knights, who were selected from the Red Cross fraternity, and kneeling on the sacred tomb, were bound by a solemn vow to guard the Holy Sepulchre, protect pilgrims, and repel the attacks of all infidels or enemies of the Cross of Christ. The city of Jerusalem was rebuilt and omamented by .AElius Adrian, Emperor of Rome, and given to the Christians in 420. The Persians cap - tured it from them in 637, and in 1008 it fell into the hands of the Saracens, under whose oppression it long groaned, until Peter the Hermit encouraged the western princes to re - lease the distressed Church, and in 1096 God - frey de Bouillon unfurled the banner of the Cross and expelled the invaders. He was invested with a crown of laurel and suffered himself to be called the King of Palestine. During the period of the Crusades the order of the Holy Sepulchre flourished, and since the loss of the Holy Land, it has continued to exist in several countries of Europe, and its ancient ritual and ceremonies are preserved to this day lii the bosom of the beloved Masonic frateriiity to which it is our privilege to belong.

Worthy Knight (to Candidate), as we are bound to acknowledge those only as members of our Order who are true and legiti - mate Royal Arch Masons, it is also our duty to expound to you that as our ancient brethren founded Freemasonry upon the instructions which they had received from Moses, Solomon and Zerubbabel at successive periods of the world’s history, so we follow the worthy traces of those Masons who have remodeled it in ac - cordance with the precepts of our Sovereign Redeemer and Master, whose titles are inscribed in His own blood above the throne of God. I shall, therefore, call upon the Prior to make known to you the allegorical sequel to the history of the Royal Arch degree. Knights resume seats and Prior proceeds. After the rebuilding of the second temple, the Masons neglected their labors, and abandoned to the ravages of time the valuable buildings which they had raised with so much pains; so that the wisdom of their workmanship, tha strength of their materials, and the beauty of their architecture were alike exposed to confu - sion, destruction and decay. But the Eternal K. H S. ORDER 47 Jehovah determined to manifest His glory and to replace the fallen material structures by that sublime and spiritual geometry whose existence human power should not be able to effect, and whose duration should be for an eternity of ages. It was then that the stone—the corner of the building was torn from the temple by the work - men and thrown among the ruins. It was then the Mystic Rose was sacrificed on a cross planted on the summit of the mountain which is elevated above the surface toward the celes - tial spheres by three squares, three circles, and three triangles. In an instant the veil of the lemple was rent, the earth was covered with darkness, the tools of Masonry were broken, the Day-Star of Mercy was obscured, and the Word was lost, It may easily be Imagined into what a depth of misery every true Mason was plunged. At that fatal moment they were en - veloped in vast consternation and unutterable dismay. Some of the brethren, who possessed relics of the former Temple, wandered among the woods and mountains in the deepest ob - scurity. Others sought the Sacred Tomb In which the Word was hidden, and watched in silence for the space of three days. Never before was such perplexity experienced by the human heart. But the will of Him who con - ducts and rules all events, at the expiration of three days caused the light to shine again; the broken tools and columns of Masonry were restored perfect; the Day-Star of Mercy ap - peared in greater brilliancy, and the word of God was found. The contusion of the Old Cov - enant was thus made light in the New Law, in the Temple of the Cross, and the Elect Breth - ren who for thirty-three years had followed the hallowed footsteps of the Redeemer, then taught others that it was necessary to know the three"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"I — w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.n[ w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichti ngargus.nI 48 K.

It was only by means of those sublime principles that Masonry reappeared to the gladdened eyes of man, and from this period Masons no longer built material edifices, but occupied themselves in spiritual buildings. Their works were sustained by tem - perance, prudence, justice and strength, and they feared no more the vicissitudes of life, or the shadowy terrors of the grave.

COM. It is a precious treasure. Admit him In the usual form. (Candidate enters holding the Gospel in his right hand, and on hk crossing the threshold the Har - binger and Lieutenants point their swords to his breast simultaneously, and demand the pass - word.) (7his is given.) ~1 COM. Noble Knight, we are informed that you have discovered a sacred treasure. Relate the circumstances thereof, for the satisfaction of the Knights now in Council. CAN. Having proceeded to the ruins of the second temple, I found that the Emperor Julian had, contrary to the p~ophecies of God, com - menced the erection of a temple on the ancient site, when it pleased the Almighty to overthrow his designs by sundry signs and miracles. Upon arriving at the works I was directed to assist the labourers, to which I consented, foreseeing that the hand of God would be displayed. Ac - cordingly, on the removal of one of the stones which had formed part of the foundations of the former building, the mouth of a vault, cut in the rock, was discovered. As the interior could not be clearly seen on account of its great depth, the overseers of the work ordered me to descend and ascertain its contents. I was therefore lowered by means of a long rope fastened to my body. On arriving at the bottom, I found water reaching up to the middle of my leg, and by feeling the walls on either side, I ascertained NOVICE AND KNIGHT. that the vault was of a quadrangular form. Re - turning towards the opening, I came upon a column, standing in the middle of the vault, not much above the surface of the water. Upon this I found parchment, wrapt up in a very fine, and clean linen cloth. Taking the parchments in my right hand, I gave a signal with the rope, and was drawn to the top by my fellow- workmen. All were amazed at the sight of the parchments, not only because they appeared quite fresh and uninjured but because it had been discovered in such a dark and ‘secret place. When it was opened, fear fell upon all—both Jews and Greeks—for at the very beginning in large characters, were written the words, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” To speak briefly, the manuscript contained the whole of St. John’s Gospel. Now this incident, together with other miracles sent from heaven about the same time, made it evident that our Lord’s prophecy of the desolation of the temple would never fall to the ground, for the Book declared that He who had uttered this was God, the Creator of all things. It showed, moreover, that they who were toiling at that building, lab - oured in vain, for a divine and immutable sen - tence had decreed the final destruction of the temple. These and similar circumstances led almost all to declare immediately that Christ was God, and that it was not pleasing to Him that the temple should be restored, COM. As a proof of your statement, you will read aloud the first five verses of the sacred record. Sir Knights. to order, (right hand on heart). (This is aone.)

CON. (to Candidate). As a reward for the dis - covery you have made, and the zeal you have shown for the Christian faith, I receive you as a Novice of this Holy Order. (Takes the cruci - fix and say, “ Ecce Homo.”) Fortified by this sublime symbol, and with the words Ecce Homo” ever present to your mind, you may now be seated in the West while the Sub-Prior instructs you in the mysteries of the Order. (Candidate is seated, and Sub-Prior proceeds.~ Noble Sir Knight, the tradition which has just been made known to you should ever im - press upon your mind, that the decrees of the Almighty cannot be reversed by the hand of man. Julian, the Apostate, attempted to re - build the Jewish Temple, but failed signally to accomplish his design, and as a punishment for his sin, we find that his end was a miserable scene ot blasphemy. It is narrated that when wounded by a Persian dart, he endeavored to mount his horse for a second charge on the enemy, but falling backwards exhausted into the arms of his attendants, he filled his hands with the blood gushing from the wound, and casting it into the air died exclaiming, bitterly: “Thou hast conquered, 0 Galil~an.” After the death of Julian, the Christian religion spread apace, except in the East, and the subsequent trials of our brethren in that part of the world, and especi - ally in Palestine, were related to you in a for - mer lecture. It is, however, my duty to relate to you the origin of Masonic rites as now prac - ticed. The Crusaders, it is said, finding them - selves unable to expel the Saracens from the Holy Land, agreed with Godfrey de Bouillon to veil the mysteries of religion under emblems, by which they would be enabled to maintain their devotions in secret, and secure themselves NOVICE AND KNIGHT. 53 against the intrusion of traitors or pretended friends. In this respect they tollowed examples laid down in the sacred Scriptures, the style of ~ihich is figurative. The model which they selected was Solomon’s Temple which emblem - atically represents the Christian Church. Hence it follows that the mysteries of the craft are in reality the mysteries of religion. The Knights were however careful not to entrust this im - portant secret to any whose fidelity and discretion had not been fully proved. They therefore invented different degrees to test their candidates, and gave them only symbolical secrets, without explanation to prevent treach - ery, to make themselves known solely to each other. For this purpose it was resolved to use different signs, words and tokens in each degree, by which they would be secured against the Saracens, or against casual cowans, or intrud - ers. The degrees adopted were in number seven, to commemorate the six days’ labour of the Great Architect of the Universe, and His hallowed rest on the seventh day, after creating all things. It also referred to the six years em - ployed in the construction of Solomon’s Temple, which, as all Masons are aware, was dedicated in the seventh year by that illustrous monarch, with a solemnity worthy of the Deity Himself. This sacred edifice is therefore the basis of figurative Masonry. In the first degree there are three symbols:—First, The creation of the world from chaos, which is represented by the candidate emerging from the outer chamber of darkness, and by the helpless condition in which he is then placed. Secondly, The candidate sees nothing before he is brought to light and the confusion of his mind as to Freemasonry is an apt illustration of the chaotic elements of nature before reduced to order and perfection"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"- --4~~-~ - w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n[ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. sd chti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI 54 NOVICE AND KNIGHT. by the fiat of the Most High. Thirdly, The candidate advances to the altar, and there separates himself from the outer world, the symbolic meaning of which is the separation of the firmament from the earth and water in the second day of creation. In like manner in the second degree, advancement in material knowl - edge and true science is figured by the work of the remaining days of the creation, and in the Master’s degree our Knightly brethren began to unfold the true mystery by narrating the assassi - nation of Hiram Abiff by false brethren. The symbolic mystery of Hiram’s death represents to us that of the Messiah, for instance, the three blows that were given to the Master Builder at the three gates of the temple, allude to the three points of condemnation against Christ at the tribunals cf Calaphas the High Priest, Herod the King and Pilate the Roman Gover - nor. It was from the last tribunal that Jesus was led to a violent and shameful death. The three blows with the square, gauge and gavel, are symbols of the blow on the cheek, the flagellation and the cruel crown of thorns. The brethren assembled round the tomb of Hiram, represent the disciples lamenting the death of Christ on the cross. The Master’s word which is said to be lost, since the death of Hiram Abiff, is the same that the Messiah pronounced on the cross and which the Jews did not comprehend In - stead of these words in the third degree, our ancient brethren substituted . . . . which in Arabic signifies, “The son of the widow is dead.” This was done to guard the real secrets from traitors, warned by the example of Judas, who betrayed his Master. The spring of acacia is the figure of the cross,which was made of wood of an acacia tree. The Royal Arch, referring to NOVICE AND KNIGHT. 55 the captivity of the Jews, shows us the persecu - tion of the Christians under Roman Emperors, and its liberty under Constantine the Great. The Red Cross” Order is the tirst degree of the series in which the ultimate object of Free - masonry were revealed; and in the ceremony of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre the allegory was further explained. The Knights of St John of Palestine were, however, the true Masons, as to them only were the words imparted, and it was only after warfare with the enemies of the faith that they received rhis privilege and were admitted to full communion with the holy brotherhood. Dearly beloved Knight, your initiation of toil and blood is now finished, and there Is no longer any temple, because the Light of the Lord is universally diffused and the world has become one Holy House of wisdom. The hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. Let us pray. (All kneel.) Oh! Jesus of Nazareth, Immaculate and Im - mortal God, assist us in the great work which we have undertaken, aid us in making this world a Temple of Love and Peace, fitted for Thy second coming, when all mysteries shall be re - vealed, and every heart laid bare before Thee, and the angelic host of Heaven. Grant we beseech Thee, that this latest sacrifice at Thine altar may prove worthy of the shrine. Arm his soul with faith in Thee, and fortitude in every trial of this mortal life, and finally may the chariot of Thy mercy convey him to the realms of bliss and glory. Amen.

The pyramids being built upon rocks shadow forth the durability of the Christian taith. Their bases were four-cornered, their external sur faces equilateral triangles, pointing to the four cardinal points, and thus denoting the entire globe. The pyramidal form also reminds us of our mortality. Its broad base represents the commencement, and its termination in a point, the end of human life.
