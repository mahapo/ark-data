CONDUCrOR OF NovIcEs—I will go unto the Altar of God. The First Herald meeting them at the entrance, says— 1ST HERALD—TO God who giveth joy to my heart. The entrance of the Aspirant into the Sacred Hall is now made in the following order— First Herald Second Herald Conductor of Novices Aspirant Torch Bearer Five circuits of the Sacred Hall are made, with the course of the Sun, which the Fraters and Officers are standing, and the following ODE is sung. ODE Ere God the Universe began, in one rude heap all matter lay Which wild disorder over-ran, nor knew the light one glimmering ray While darkness o’re the whole confusion reigned without control Then God arose, his thunders hurl’d, and bade the elements arise In Air he hung the pendant World, and o’er it spread the azure skies;"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Stars in circles caused to run, and in the center fixed the Sun. Then Man he called forth out of dust, and formed him with a living Soul All things committed to his trust, and made him Lord of all, the whole But yet ungrateful unto heaven he proved, and was from Eden driven. From thence proceeded all our woes, nor could mankind one comfort share Until the Rosicrucians rose and formed another Eden here: Where true pleasure ever reigns, and native innocence regains. Here crystal fountains flow, here naught that’s vile can enter in The Tree of Knowledge here doth grow, whose fruit we taste, yet free from sin While sweet friendship does abound, and guardian Angels hover round. At the close of the ODE, the procession halts in front of the Suifragan in the West. Sum~AGAN—Brother Conductor of Novices, what is the desire of this Aspirant? Cot~rucroR OF NOVICES—He desires to proceed from darkness into the pure light of knowledge, to learn the secrets and Doctrines of Nature, and discern the wondrous principles by which the Universe is governed. SUFFRAGAN—My Brother, your desire is laudable, but we are mortal like yourself, why come to us? CO~uerOR OF NOVICES—Because he believes that among you are practiced many great virtues, and that the growth of ages has added to your store of knowledge. He desires to be received. SUFFRAGAN—We appreciate your faith, but must remind you that the road to knowledge is long, and the life of man is short; remember too hat what the heart conceives is not always accomplished. Build not your hopes too high upon our Order. Our aim is true, our desire to be humble, our study to be wise. The Rosaic System left wealth, honor and power to the worldly; pleasure and indolence to the victous. We cast our lot with the virtuous and the pure, pressing forward in the pursuit of wisdom. Our objects are fraternal aid and encouragement in working out the great problem of life, in the advancement of science, in the propagation of knowledge and in the diffusion of that glorious acclamation “Glory to God in the Highest and on Earth, Peace, Good-will toward men.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This quotation may be chanted.

Zeal in an exalted purpose is most commendable, and with it faith can remove mountains. Prepare then to undergo the elementary tests requires by our Order.

Listen! HIsTORICAL NARRATIvE Buried in the depths of solitude, far from the sight and sound of human life, partly rock-hewn and partly constructed of massive stone closely and carefully placed in position, were three clustering and connecting, but equally sized compartments; so completely and studiously compacted and deadened in their structure and approach that the outside world could not know of their existence were the roar of thunder, or the shouts of Myriads to awake their echoes in these subterranean halls. One chamber was devoted to a general Laboratory with a section set apart for domestic purposes, with ingenious sieve-like flues for the unrecognizable escape to the outer world of the smoke, gasses and fumes. This Apartment was long and of ample size; while the Second, also rectangular in shape, was set apart for rest, containing rude couches and also simple tables for simpler fare. Opposed to this, across the Main Laboratory and opening into it, but with descending steps, was the Third and largest Hall, with rising pointed roof of rugged structure, used for a monkish study and Chapel, as well. AT regular intervals through the center, were 4 cubic tables used as desks with seats of stone, and pendant from the center of the lofty roof hung the wondrous lamp, whose radiant flame, was as the rosy light of a summer’s setting sun, intensely golden, illuminating all space, never needing care and inexhaustible. High above all else in the groins of the roof, was a white andblack, yet massive Roman Cross, deftly carved in marble. Into these sacred, silent precincts none were allowed to enter except the Adepts, the Magister Templi and the Magus, save at the daily morning and evening hour of prayer, when all must gather for silent"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"worship, or at periods of Reception of Aspirants, or during the Annual Assem - bly. These solitary chambers formed the home of 36 of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood,—no more, no less—could occupy these rock-built Halls: all others were constrained to serve their learnings and to account for deeds of good and service done. Their brief sojourn being ended, from the entire number the Magus again tailed off those who were to serve humanity at large and 36 remained. With pestle, mortar, alembic, crucible and forge; with nitre, resin, roselite and various sulphate strangely compounded, and with astronomic instruments and tablets so passed the years in these wondrous Caverns; all intent upon the abstruse study of analyses and syntheses to the end of conquering the possible; the reduction or destruction of pain and waste in physical organism, the rejuvenation of man, the obtainment of the general solvent, or Menstrum Universale, which should possess the power of removing all the seeds of disease from the human system, thereby renewing life, the transmutation of baser to superior metals, or the elevation of the Divine in Man. Twice had the iron-tongued bell echoed through the rocks, startling the monks from their reveries and duties, proclaiming some potent special secret found. Once it was the Mystery solved, that alloy and baser metal had yielded to transmutation to Silver, and again, once to the richer Gold, but their products were not permitted to result in ease and luxury. The greatest secret yet lay hid, the prolongation, the rejuvenation of animal life. ‘Twas death to strike the toscin-bell, save by him whose skill had solved one of four problems: First, the rejuvenation of the ever-burning lamp; Second, the transmutation to Silver; Third, the transmutation to gold; and Fourth, the discovery of the Elixir Vita?. Of this last, long had the Frater, Signor Gualdi, a Magister Templi, daily hoped for the final solution; that he was on the verge of the discovery he had no doubt, and his belief was imbued in the minds of his fellows, he longed to sound the bell and startle his own soul. In letters of fire he had written this aphorism, IgneNitrumRorislnvenitur, “by Fire the Nitre of the dew is extracted” and this was to be his solution. All nature slept, the wearied monks save—save one—had gone to rest, the very fires of the forge were wrapped in slumber, when at the dread hour, the hopeful Gualdi, rose from his seat of stone in the brilliant but rocky chapel, and shouting EUREKA, rand out the bell with unearthly clangor, startling the very rocks into echo. It as suddenly ceased as Monk followed Monk into the Holy Chamber to meet, to see nought, even to hear but the still resounding echo of the clamoring bell."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"At the central table-altar were open books of Gualdi; by their side a small vessel containing nitre and a crucible partly filled with golf held in solution. A further search disclosed the overcome Gualdi prone on the pavement, still holding the thong of the bell. Repair now to the Celebrant. The Aspirant is conducted to the Celebrant by the North. CELEBRANT—Here, for the present, we must rest, but we cannot leave the subject without offering to remove from your mind unpleasant impressions, if any exist, as to who the former Rosicrucians were. The Society, or Fraternity of Rosicrucians has been largely misrepresented, and the minds of students greatly prejudiced. The want of intelligence would be simply amazing were it not evident that the mischievous ignorance of a few has been repeated successively without individual research. Ignorance, preju - dice, envy and conceit have taken possession of the minds of the critics and Historians; yet the unique and attractive Rosaic doctrines interested vast masses of 17th century, although the society had taken its rise in the latter part of the 15th century. The lives of the Rosicrucians were dramatic to a sensational degree. The practical branch of the Society was in charge of Alchemists and Hermeticists, who while they claimed—and not without much reason—their ability to transmute metals to Silver or Gold, further sought for mental and moral powers, rather than riches, which are the aims of true philosophers. The real philosopher looks not for pomp, glitter, splendor nor luxury, he has been schooled in a higher sphere and he appreciates their transitory nature. Wealth in money to him is dross, far desire, and freedom from confused annoyance of worldly thoughts, which are engendered and distracted by the purchases of riches. Possessions, honor, rank and money to him are but as trifles; he forces the growing Supernatural soul to work amidst the loving sunshine and to propagate holy thoughts as the most precious of heavenly gifts. Worldly grandeur fades before intellectual elevation; the physical world sinks below him and he feels nearer to the angelic Hosts. He values the unseen kingdoms, and glimpses of immortal glories obtained from Magic reveries. He dwells in an atmosphere of heavenly music, his soul keeping harmony with the yearnings of his intellect. The earnest wish of the Rosicrucians was to pass through with World unnoticed and unchallenged, but ever prepared for exalted action when in their"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"power, without a revelation of who they are. Now, Frater Zelator, having passed through the ceremonies required by our Ordinance, and having knelt before the Altar of Light, you are permitted to join in the Mystic labors of this grade. This privilege is conferred only upon discreet and worthy men to whom the revelations ofTheosophy and Hermetic Science may be safely confided. In our ceremony you may have noticed a similarity to certain Rite practiced in the Ancient Mysteries. It is thus that we hope to lead the sincere Aspirant t~ the lofty realms of intellectual Truth and to the knowledge of the Everlasting. We trace the growth of our philosophy through the remotest avenues of time, sustained by the continuous advent of Sages and Magi, a grand and spiritual procession of teachers illuminating the the pathway to Wisdom, The great and wise men of were the heralds of our principles and kindled their lamps at the Sacred Fire in which we now rejoice. Falter not because the way seems long and the Soul is weary, but toil on toward the higher planes of Wisdom. Life itself is imaged in this opening ceremony, and the serpent course, truly and divinely directed, is that of the Wise Men in search of Truth. Difficulties and perils may beset your mental vision, even as obstacles present themselves in our worldly affairs, let us, however, remember that Knowledge is Power and that the source of all Wisdom will sustain our feeble steps on the journey that leads to Eternal Life.

From the mystical Cross is formed the letters spelling the Latin ~rd LtJX, or Light or Fire: hence the hidden significoncy in the Aphorism, “By Fire the &itrc of the Dew is extracted”, or “Igne, Nit~am, Roris, Invenitur.” The great revival in this class er branch of Rosicrucianism was at Paris, In ~iarch, 1623, — when the ni~ber 36 was thus distributed, 6 in Paris, 6 in Italy, 6 in Spain, 12 in Germany, 4 in Sweden and 2 in Switzerland. You well remember what was said to you of the discovert of transmutation to Silver, and the excitement occasioned thereby, as narr~.tcd to you in the preceding Grade of Theoricus, but the wi.ldncs~ of enthusiasm was evinced, when the Practicus Philosophers sounded that terrible Bell, which announced the double discovery of the ‘:e.nsmutation to “White Gold”. or ?l.~.tinum. and that of VIRGflI GOLD The sole attention of the 6 Alchemists of the Practicus Grade was given to the transformation of metals to Gold, immediately after realizing the force of Primitia when exercised by Fire unon certain primary metals and producing silver. Realizing that through evolution all things in the Universe had succt~bcd to change, and that by progression even in the metals a theory of successive changes is established by which nature reveals strange results, — the task remained to ascertain the recuisite metals for the combination, with the proper proportions ihereof, and the dynamic conditions or laws by the use of primitia to produce the desired result, which was Gold."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"(Page 6) They- were confident that iZercury was en essential: that copper i~as necessary, and most likely sulphur and. tin.

But had these Alchemists once revealed the power of gold— making, the metal would have lost its value and not unlikely the nrc- due or would have lest his life to gratify- an insatiate people. 3ut no, —the very ~iowledgc of their magic power, and the su~rise at it: existence, delighted th~ more, than aught the !forld could give.

A consideration of this Science includes the movements, dist:i— bution, and the physical characteristics of the Heavenly Bodies. ~ to that of tilling the soil to obtain sustenance for life, Astronowr is the oldest Science, for it became essential to measure time, and this coul-d be furnished only through a study of the firmament. The first recorded observations of any rcmarka:ole accuracy are those from the Tower of 3d, at Babylon, by the Ass’rrians in the 23rd century before this era. This powerful ~pire well understood the use of the Dial, the precession of the Ecuino zes, and within a fraction the exact length of the tropical year, they even predicted in some oases, the return of Comets. The chief seat of Astronomical learning among the Hindees was at Benares, but the knowledge of the Indians in this Science f-as n~t equal to their ncighbors.Thc Egyptians, hor?ever, who erected their pyramids with mathematical precision, and not unlikely for astronom— ical purposes, and ~ho erected numerous monoliths to their Sun—Gad Ha, justly receive credit in astronomical history. The r~arkable coincidence exists, that through the inclined. entrance of the Great Pyramid, the Star Draco, in Hesperides, at its upper transit was visible day and night, and. marked the period 2170 B.C. or the period when the chronological mensuration takes 25,588 years to return to itself again. The eection of that Pyranid marked the great year of the Plciades. The Astronomy of the Chinese is ancient though inexact.
