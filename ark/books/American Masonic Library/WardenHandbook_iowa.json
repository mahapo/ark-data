You will be asked to oversee every aspect of lodge activity during your term in office. To properly fu lfill that position, all that will be expected of you is to have the wisdom of Solomon, the patience of Job, the financial skills of a Rockefeller, and the ability to walk on water. No problem so far. Right? You will need to be a strong leader, a skillf ul arbiter of conflicts, a careful planner, a motivator, a cheerleader, a good communicator, a constant attendee, and, in many cases, the most loyal worker. Still no problem. Right? You will also need to be ritually proficient in Opening and Closing your lodge and in the Degree work, be familiar with all the nuances of balloting and conducting meetings, serve as Master of Ceremonies for lodge social functions, and intelligently represent your lodge at Grand Lodge. Oh, and in your spare time don’t forget your job, family, and other minor commitments. If you’re starting to feel a little unnerved, don’t feel alone. Almost everyone who has ascended to the East has shared your feelings. It is lonely at the top. It is somewhat intimidating to realize that ( as a former Past Master and Past Grand Master of Missouri Harry S Truman noted on assuming the Presidency of the United States) “the buck stops here.” In order to make your job easier, the Lodge Service Committee has put together this handbook. In it you will find useful information about a variety of topics (Duties of Lodge Officers and Committeemen, Grand Lodge, Protocol, Awards and Recognition, Masonic Charities, New Members, Communication, Press Releases) that you will need to be familiar with as Ma ster. Included also are lists of activities for lodge functions, sources for things like educational programs, different types of materials (membership, leadership, etc), videos, and speakers and a calendar containing important dates and timelines for you to remember during your term. Finally there is information that will assist you in assessing your lodge’s condition, setting goals, planning activities, building a team, and improving the long range outlook for your lodge. Soon, the brethren of your lodg e will demonstrate their faith, confidence, and trust in you by electing you as head of their Masonic family. Your pride in that family and your determination to work to maintain and improve your family’s health and vigor not only during your term but als o into the future will provide motivation for you as you enter the year because for that time “the buck does stop with you.” Don’t, however, feel that you must shoulder the load by yourself. There are valuable resources within the lodge and at the Grand Lodge level to make your job easier and more manageable. Use those resources, plan well, give your best effort, and both you and your lodge can enjoy a pleasurable and successful year. We hope that this handbook will be a valuable resource for you in fulf illing your duties and that it is passed on to those who follow you in office."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"3 Monthly Reminder For Masters And Wardens As Worshipful Master, your official term of office will begin after you are duly installed in January. However, you are already awar e that your planning and preparation will begin much before that. In addition, since the Grand Lodge year and the Lodge year do not coincide, there are several dates in the Fall that are important to the incoming Master so be sure to look at those months as you plan your activities for the year. Because of the overlap in programs like Lodge of the Year and Plus One, it is important that the outgoing and incoming Masters work together in achieving the goals set for those programs. This calendar only provi des a listing of events or deadlines that should occur for every lodge during the year. Although Stated Communications are listed in each month’s schedule, some lodges, as a result of provisions in their by -laws, are dark during certain months of the year . Every Worshipful Master and his officers are encouraged to arrange a more detailed calendar listing individual lodge activities and functions. Ideally, this listing should contain a broad variety of activities and events which will provide something of interest to every segment of the lodge membership and their families and should be shared with the members of the lodge as early in the year as possible. JANUARY: A) Make sure that you have provided the lodge Secretary with the following names: (a) Appointed Offi cers (b) Lodge Education Committee (c) Lodge Membership Committee B) Lodge installation ( an installation in any month other than January require s a dispensation from the Grand Master) C) Conduct your first Stated Communication D) Open an annual Lodge of Sorrow (Optional) E) See to it that your lodge is represented at a Secretaries conference F) Make sure your annual planning calendar, one of the required items for Lodge of the Year, is published and submitted to the Grand Lodge office by January 31.

Each Lodge is different and every Master is unique. The information is presen ted as suggestions for your consideration. Take the time to study and reflect; share it with your officers; keep it handy in your briefcase and use it when applicable. Be aware that the procedure described here is the definitive or ultimate process appli cable to a Lodge of any size, location, and make -up. Not all Masters need to execute the full formal process to reap the potential benefits available; utilizing a condensed version should prove to be beneficial. Keep in mind that a textbook does not gove rn a Lodge; only the Master possesses such authority and that is you. Make each moment count and make everyone around you a success. This is your year. How will it be remembered? The principles that influence how the Lodge is governed are the same as th ose that guide all organizations. Organizations, large and small, government and private, fraternal and corporate, successfully operate only by paying strict attention to the needs, aspirations and concerns of people. Successful corporations, either frat ernal or private, can trace their success directly to the amount of concern that they exhibit for the people they serve. Just as important to remember is th at people make organizations, not th e required paperwork, not the beautiful ritual, not the fancy or ganizational charts, not elaborate trestle boards. The management principles contained within this chapter are designed to assist you in administering the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"5 affairs of your Lodge by properly managing yourself and your members, the critical element which con stitutes every successful Lodge and every successful Master. No man can accomplish every task that is required to build a vibrant and progressive Lodge. Team Building is the process in which you, as Master, assemble, mold, and direct groups of participant s to labor on tasks toward a common and well -defined goal. Your Lodge officers and members are your team. Some are at home, some are sitting on the sidelines waiting and wanting to become involved, and some are energetic and active. The successful Maste r utilizes each category of participants to the fullest extent. Each officer, every sideliner and even your inactive members must be thoroughly educated in what needs to be accomplished, how it is going to be accomplished and who is going to do the work. To be successful, each of the participants must understand the goal, provide input on how to achieve the goal, and recognize the duties and responsibilities of each team member. Strategic planning is an absolute necessity to identify opportunities, optimiz e performance, and maximize accomplishments during your term as Master. Planning is a process which taps the creativity of the Lodge and assures that participants have an ownership interest in the ultimate plan developed. It provides the ability to choos e a future rather than being forced into one. It must be written and it must be clearly communicated to everyone associated with the Lodge. When done properly, the strategic planning process is a critical step in team building for the Lodge currently and for the future. The first step in strategic planning is to consider what the future will be if nothing changes. Things which we need to look at to make this forecast include: * Membership * Finances * Programs and Activities * Organizational Struc ture * Leadership and Use of Human Resources * Facilities and Equipment * External Community Membership . We must determine (a) the number of members, (b) the number of active members, (c) the identities of new members, (d) the age of membership, (e) the number of members residing locally, (f) occupations represented, and (g) potential members. Solicit and/or update the members talent surveys on file in the Lodge records. Finances . The sources and amounts of income must be identified along with admi nistrative and program expenses. The progress of planned fund raisers and revenue must be projected. Anticipated expenses for the Lodge also must be recognized. Programs and Activities . List all programs and activities with known or tentative dates. In clude ritual practices and degree work. Incorporate information from the Secretary's calendar including due dates for committee selection, Grand Lodge dues payments, required reports, etc. Organize this list by type, noting the purpose of each. Include information about how the activity was initiated, who has responsibility, predicted benefits, and any costs or revenue generated. Pay particular attention to the cost of major programs. Save this list! It is your preliminary planning calendar for the ne xt year. Organizational Structure . Review the organizational chart for the local Lodge paying particular attention to the names and purposes of all committees. Note how decisions are being made and by whom, especially for critical items."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6 Leadership and H uman Resources . Identify recent, current, and potential leaders. Establish what level of training for leadership has been done and is needed. Ascertain the current activities of all committees and the people active on them. Verify how leaders and commi ttee members have been recruited and assigned. Review how recently the membership interests and talent identification surveys were completed. Determine the extent, quality, and participation in ritual training. Review the Lodge Officer Leadership Guide to assure a comprehensive analysis is performed. Facilities and Equipment . Identify what real estate is owned by the Lodge and the value of the property. Determine if any repairs or construction is desired or anticipated. Establish the condition and val ue of equipment. Review usage of space and equipment. External Data . Obtain data regarding population trends, demographic trends, family trends, association membership trends, competition, allies. Consider the effect of each of these and social changes on past, present, and potential Masonic membership. This forecasting will tell us that some things in the future are improving or increasing while some things in the future will be getting worse or are decreasing. But most importantly, we must remember th at what the future ultimately brings is our decision to make. (Please note that a user - friendly questionnaire available from the Lodge Service Committee includes these items). The second step in the strategic planning process is to identify the distinctiv e areas which we want to keep and those specific areas where we desire change. This part of the process involves: * Ideas * Mission * Goals * Objectives * Action Plans * Monitor and Evaluate Ideas . Assemble the current Master, Wardens, Treasu rer, Secretary, and a few interested, active members in a suitable meeting place which offers relaxation and comfort. Provide suitable refreshments. Review the information gathered in step one of the strategic planning process. Assign one man to a large flip chart or chalkboard with appropriate markers. Ask the question, \"What is the biggest problem existing within our Lodge?\" Allowing each participant to list only one response, go around the room and solicit an answer from every individual. Continue around the room numerous times until all perceived problems are listed. Only then should the group discuss these ideas, list in them priority order, and offer possible solutions or resolution. (See Appendix for sample ideas) Mission . The mission statemen t should provide a focus for the Master, officers, and members to assure that goals being established for the Lodge team are consistent with the principles of Masonry. It should answer the questions \"Why are we here?\" and \"What is our purpose in this comm unity?\" and \"What benefits should we provide to members and their families?\" Goals . For each important idea, the group should establish goals which are specific, realistic, important, attainable, measurable, and time specific. Review the specific require ments for \"Lodge of the Year\" and \"Plus One\" recognition -- both excellent missions for the Lodge. Objectives . Each goal should generate specific objectives which are understandable, feasible, and require action. An objective should state an achievement an d assign accountability. Action Items . Action items are generated from objectives. The action item states what task will be done, who will do it, when it will be done, where it will be done, and how much it will cost. Add these action items to the preli minary planning calendar developed during the initial stages of strategic planning."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"7 Monitor and Evaluate . The Master initiates and retains overall responsibility for assuring that strategic planning is done. He delegates the work to individuals and com mittees. And he ultimately is responsible for creating, approving, monitoring, and evaluating goal attainment. Goal Implementation Now that you have determined what your goals are , what you want to do and where you want to be, th e question is, “H ow do y ou get there from here? ” One effective too in goal -setting is an object planner developed by well -known motivational writer and speaker, Roger Dawson. He suggests listing five different questions on a sheet of paper: 1. My one year objective is 2. My five year objective is 3. Skills and qualifications I’ll need 4. What I’m willing to give up 5. What I’ll do this month Answer each question carefully and thoughtfully. Solicit the input and assistance of your officers in some or all of the questions. Your one year object ive(s) should include the time line that you and/or your lodge has set up for next year. You could also include some personal objectives within this category. As far as the five year objective is concerned, you will almost assuredly need the help of your junior officers to complete it (unless you plan on being Master of your lodge for the next five years!) Skills and qualifications that you and/or your lodge will need to carry out these goals are directly related to the goals. For instance, if one of yo ur goals is to confer each of the three degrees from the East, and you are not a particularly good ritualist, you could write down “seek help from one of the D.L.s in our area to improve my ritual.” Some of your goals may conflict with your current lifest yle or the historic day to day activities (or lack thereof) of your lodge. That is where number 4 comes into play. If we stick to the example above, in order to improve your ritual, you will have to spend some extra time working on it. Maybe that means one less night a week in front of the TV set or giving up an hour of sleep a night to study your ritual. Last, it is important that you take some action immediately to work toward your goals . What are you going to do this month to start meeting your goal s? If increased attendance at meetings is one of them, perhaps, this month you need to have a meal before the meeting if you aren’t already doing that, or you could have an interesting program. Another option would be to set up a calling tree so that eac h member is contacted personally and reminded to come to lodge. Dawson suggests putting your object planner on paper and filling it out for twenty -one consecutive days. Granted, this may have some practical limitations for some of the objectives that you r lodge has helped you list. Why do it for twenty -one days? Research has shown that if a person does something for twenty -one days in a row, it becomes a habit. We want to continually be in the habit of working toward our goals. After your goals have be en identified and you have decided what you want to accomplish this year, you need to establish a time frame for each one . Not only a time line, which is essentially your calendar of events for the year, but an actual deadline for accomplishing each goal. As one motivational speaker author puts it, “A goal is a dream with a deadline.” By definition, a goal should be specific, measurable, accountable with a time frame. For instance, you shouldn’t have a goal such as, “I want to have a better year than la st year.” A better goal would be, “Our lodge wants to Raise three more candidates the first quarter of this year than we did last year.” It is specific (increase number of members), measurable (three candidates), with a time frame (April 1). The account ability comes in when you compare your actual performance to the goals you set. Another key to successful goal setting is breaking down your goals into smaller portions . The reason for this is that by doing so you will have a quicker resolution and hopef ully more immediate gratification. For instance, if we go back to the example of Raising three more candidates by April 1 than the lodge did the previous year, that means that you need to confer six third degrees by this time. Couldn’t you break down thi s goal into the smaller goals of two Master Mason Degrees each"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 month? Doesn’t the number two sound a lot less intimidating than six? Sure it does! What’s more, after you have attained your mini -goal of Raising two new candidates, you will feel a sense o f accomplishment two months sooner than you would if you had waited until April 1. Furthermore, you still feel that sense of accomplishment for the larger goal of six new Master Masons in addition to that you felt after the smaller goals of two each month was attained. You experience success sooner and more often, and it eventually becomes a habit! Once you have identified your goals, it is important to continually review and update them . Goals aren’t something you just set once and forget about. They r equire monitoring. As you go through the year, ask yourself where are you on your path to accomplishing each goal. If you are ahead of schedule, is the goal too easy? Does it need to be revised to keep it a challenge? Conversely, if you are behind sche dule, why is that? Do you have a goal that is unattainable, or are you off -track? If you have a goal that truly is unattainable, change it to something a little more reasonable. You want your goals to be challenging not impossible. One of the most impor tant things to keep in mind is to not try to do everything yourself . Don’t do it during your year as Senior Warden, certainly not as Worshipful Master. Involve your officers, involve the whole lodge. When you have your planning session, try to get as ma ny brethren there as possible. The best way to keep a lodge busy and active is to have happy and active members. Few things will have as much success in your attendance and activities as keeping your members involved. Give them a proprietary interest in what goes on in lodge by making them a part of the planning process. If they feel they have contributed to the planning, they will be much more likely to actively participate in seeing those plans carried out successfully. After you have included your me mbers in the planning phase, by all means, don’t stop there. Keep them as involved and interested as possible in the execution of those plans. When you sit in the East, don’t try to assume all of the duties, problems, opportunities, etc. all by yourself. Appoint committees, and let them do the work. Have the committee chairs report at the lodge meetings and take action, if necessary. Don’t undermine the responsibility of the chairmen by rehashing the work of the committee at your meetings. Keep the pr oprietary spark that you lit in your planning session burning brightly by keeping your members involved, active, and happy. One of the most important tools to use to make your goals become reality can be said in one simple word “ Preparation .” This is one of Rick Pitino’s “Ten secrets of Success.” Pitino, former head basketball coach of the 1995 NCAA National Champion Kentucky Wildcats, puts it this way, “you wouldn’t see a professional athlete show up for an 8:00 game at 7:55. He/she is there several hou rs ahead of time preparing for the game ahead.” Similarly, as a lodge officer, is it sufficient to arrive only five minutes prior to your Stated or Called meeting? Certainly the Master, and probably the Wardens as well, should arrive at least one half ho ur before the stated time to prepare for the evening’s business/activities. Few things will have more of a negative impact on attendance than a disorganized meeting. The Master should go over all items of business with his Wardens and his committee chair men prior to the meeting. He should make sure that the committee heads are ready to give clear, concise reports so that the lodge doesn’t have to rehash the business that the committees have or should have taken care of. As Senior Warden, you will likely be the chair of a number of committees. You can help your Master by being fully prepared to report. Likewise, you will be doing yourself a favor by setting a good example for your Junior Warden to follow next year. In conclusion, keep in mind that it is important to establish good goals, those that are specific, measurable, and have a deadline. Use the five step process for laying the groundwork for your success. Determine what your one and five year objectives are, the skills that you will need to accomplish them, what you’re willing to sacrifice to make those objectives pan out, and what you will do right now to get started. Break down your major goals into smaller portions that allow you"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"9 to experience success on a smaller but much more immediate b asis. Utilize the talents and skills of your brethren in setting these goals and establishing a timeline for your year in the East. Constantly review your goals to make sure that you are staying on track, ensuring that the goals you originally set are ch allenging but realistic. Finally, remember that the goal setting and implementation process is an important and ongoing one. If you don’t know exactly what you want to do and when you want it done by, chances are you will do nothing. Good Luck! Coaching and Teambuilding Skills Both people skills and technical skills are necessary to make Lodge members into a team that is more cohesive, more highly motivated, and more productive. America's most effective corporate coaches and team leaders share nine suc cess indicators: Their people support each other and share a \"can do\" attitude. They communicate expectations and give meaningful feedback. They meet their deadlines and fulfill the objectives of their projects. Their meetings have purpose and lead to specific actions. They deal effectively with challenges and problems. Their team's productivity is high; the quality of work is top -notch. Their team members are enthusiastic and motivated. They know how to blend different personalities into a harmonio us group. Their workers respect them, and so do their bosses -- giving them credibility throughout the organization. The Master must assess the current effectiveness of his Lodge and recognize the basic differences between a group and a team . The four most significant traits of an effective Lodge team are: Members think of themselves as an interdependent unit. Each willingly applies his unique talents and knowledge to Lodge objectives. Information and explanations are freely given in an open and honest a tmosphere. Conflict is turned into an opportunity to generate new ideas and deepen relationships. Individually team members should exhibit a number of key attitudes including a high level of self - esteem, flexibility, open -mindedness, dependability, self -responsibility, a sense of humor, commitment, and honesty. In addition to these team traits, there are six commandments the Master as team leader must actively follow to assu re team -oriented success. Mobilize Commitment. Not only the Master, but also th e Lodge team members must buy - in to the team concept. Develop a Shared Vision of how to organize and mobilize to increase Lodge effectiveness. Strategic planning provides the opportunity for this vision. Foster: Consensus for the vision, Competence to e nact it, and Cohesion to move it along. There must be support for the decisions, not total agreement. Enlist Support from all Lodge officers and committees. Remember to point out the mutual benefit to all. Make Formal Changes in systems, structures, and personnel after the team is clear about its goals, objectives, and action plans."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 Monitor and Adjust Strategies in response to problems in the teambuilding effort. The subtle differences between a Master committed to management and one who focuses on lead ership can spell the difference between an average group of Lodge members and a successful Lodge team. Disregarding this wisdom minimizes the potential for achievement. The leader does the right thing, while the manager does things right. The leader buil ds a team and pursues innovation, while the manager administers the same tired programs. The leader seeks the benefits of change and advancement, while the manager searches for the comfort of continuity and conformity. The leader focuses on people and ou tcomes, while the manager directs his attention to process and procedure. The leader is concerned with empowering the Lodge to move forward while the manager is content to keep it from slipping backwards. The leader looks for opportunities to empower his team and transform the lodge, while the manager avoids the potential friction of growth. The leader involves all members to develop direction for the Lodge, while the manager gives directions to the members. The leader leads by personal power earned thr ough demonstrated commitment, while the manager manages based solely upon the power of his position. In developing a highly -effective Lodge, team spirit can not be ignored by either the Master or Lodge team members. All must focus on setting goals which f oster group success and individual success. In addition to acknowledging each other's separate needs, common ground must be identified and joint responsibility for success accepted. When this necessitates sacrifice for the group, it must be handled gracef ully. And the final ingredient of team spirit, pride must be consistently emphasized. To maximize the positive outcome of a Lodge, an action plan for excellence is required. As noted in the strategic planning section, this requires answers to Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How? The Lodge team must identify barriers and resources (traditionally men, materials, methods, machines, and mother nature), brainstorm action steps for removing barriers, brainstorm other steps, prioritize action steps, assign dea dlines and responsibilities, and establish progress check points. Often overlooked or handled ineptly is prioritizing. On occasion conflict among Lodge team members may arise, and the Master must act swiftly to prevent conflict from devastating the positi ve effects of team -building. Generally a seven -step approach for managing conflict will prove to be successful. Analyze conflict to achieve common understanding. \"Seek first to understand, then to be understood.\" Steven Covey Describe the conflict. W hat are people experiencing, seeing, thinking, feeling? Clarify the conflict. When? Where? What happens? Facts? Opinions? Root Causes? Additional data needs? Alienation check -- How do you feel? Focus upon goals to find the overlap. Outcomes What are we trying to accomplish in this situation? What do we want the results to be? What are the parameters and priorities within which we can or must resolve this conflict? What solution will best achieve our agreed -upon goals?"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 Brainstorm alter natives/options Select best options Build contracts The critical nature of communication regardless of the stage of development that the team happens to be engaged in can not be overemphasized. Of the three modes of communication -- aggressive, passive, and assertive -- most leaders and team members find that assertive is the most effective. The Master must remember that only 7% of communication comes from the actual words spoken (verbal), while 38% is voice (tone, volume, inflection, etc.) and 55% is vis ual (body language, facial expression, etc.). The Master should remember \"WARMTH\" when speaking. W ear a smile A n open posture R ise and lean forward M ake eye contact T erritorial zone/touch H ead nodding (acknowledgement not agreement) Perhaps of even more importance is the ability to actively listen when another is speaking. Most people are being totally honest when they say \"I see what you mean\" when they understand a message. Finally, the successful coach will make his team a key player in the large r organizational success. Seven ideas to bring about this transformation are: Develop a vision for Masonry in Iowa and ways in which your Lodge can support it. View your function with the eyes of current members, potential members, and the general publi c. Search out the most creative fraternal or civic organization in your area and adapt their successes. Greet change in your Lodge with enthusiasm. Brainstorm on actions your Lodge team can take to help the Iowa Grand Lodge deal with a priority problem. Build a creative project into each of your Lodge officer's and committee objectives. Identify a strategic issue that needs to be brought to the Iowa Grand Lodge's attention. To be a successful team builder and Master, you must begin this strategic plann ing process -- forecasting, brainstorming, goal setting, development of the action calendar, and implementation of the plan -- while still a Warden. Endeavor to complete these steps of the process as soon as possible, but no later than these recommended dates . May of the year preceding your installation as Master, distribute the questionnaire regarding physical needs of the Lodge, assessment of ritual strengths and weaknesses, program and activity suggestions, etc. Mail this to all members and request that it be completed and brought to the Lodge or mailed back by the stated communication; be assertive in follow -ups. As necessary solicit updates to the file of member talent surveys. Begin gathering data needed for the forecasting segment of strategic plannin g and begin preparation of the preliminary planning calendar. In September plan to attend the Annual Grand Lodge Communication; encourage your anticipated Wardens to attend also. Identify potential appointive officers and committee members. Data gatherin g which is necessary for forecasting must be completed. Finalize your preliminary planning"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 calendar and conduct the brainstorming session described in \"Ideas.\" Your planning calendar should be virtually completed following the brainstorming session. Octo ber should include the analysis of member talent surveys which were updated in May. Verify that the relevant dates from the secretary's calendar have been included on your Lodge calendar. This calendar should be in writing and could be distributed and di scussed during the stated communication. With the November election you should finalize the appointed officer selections, make Lodge committee appointments, announce public installation plans for January, and provide the written calendar for the following year. In December meet with the elected officers, appointed officers, and committee members for an open dialogue about the Plan and to confirm their commitment to it. This meeting should clarify any lingering questions or concerns about who is responsibl e for what, when and how it will be accomplished, and the process to measure and report success. In conclusion, strategic planning is helpful, essential, critical for every Lodge regardless of size, location, or membership diversity. Many of the steps can be streamlined or modified to meet the unique needs of the particular Master and Lodge. When coupled with a strong commitment to team building, strategic planning in a candid, honest, straight -forward manner will improve a Lodge and assure its strength.

Membership Committee. The Ma sonic Code of Iowa does not mention or define the role of a subordinate lodge Membership Committee. The Lodge Service Committee offers the following suggestions: Assist the Worshipful Master and Wardens in developing strategies for membership retention an d growth. Membership includes getting present members to become active in lodge meetings again. Ask questions, find out why members are not active. Meet with the Worshipful Master and Wardens to help create a n annual calendar of activities for the membersh ip. Assist the Worshipful Master and Secretary in contacting brothers with unpaid dues , determining their situation and need. Most lodges have a few unfinished degrees. These people showed an interest in Freemasonry at one time. Contact them and rekindle t hat interest. Talk with other lodges in your area. Don't be afraid to copy what works. Why reinvent the wheel? \"This list could go on and on, but these ideas should help you get started. Membership is the lifeblood of Freemasonry. It doesn't just happen. I t takes a little initiative and work. BECOME ACTIVE and see your lodge and our Fraternity benefit.\" As in the case of lodge officers, the duties of the committeemen may be given duties which derive from customs and traditions of the lodge. Once again, thes e duties must never be in conflict with the Code of Iowa or the Bylaws of the lodge. As a member of the Membership Committee you can do much for your lodge. Remember that organized activity can be contagious and will spill over into other areas of your lod ge's activity. Utilize the Lodge Service Committee as a resource.

Thi s statement may seem obvious, but, in many cases, lodge, that were very successful in other areas, did not pay attention to membership and their numbers slowly dwindled and the age of their membership continued to grow until they lacked the energy or will to continue and were forced to consolidate. Years ago, when lodges were the center of community life, gaining new members was not a problem because everyone in the community knew who the Masons were, what they stood for, and wanted to be a part of the org anization. Today, for a variety of reasons, that is no longer the case, and attracting new members requires planning, organization and effort by the officers and members of the lodge. Membership must be a concern of every member not just that of the Mast er of the Membership Committee. Membership in a lodge can be increased in four ways: restoration of members who have been suspended for non -payment of dues, completion of unfinished degrees, affiliations, and new members. Each of these areas are a potenti al source of membership for the lodge. Restorations : Since 1990, 5423 members have been suspended for non -payment of dues. Of those 5423 members suspended, 1101 have since been restored. This means that 4322 men who thought enough of the Fraternity to co mmit their time and energy to petition, take their degrees, and learn the proficiencies are available as potential members. During the time that has passed since they were suspended, the circumstances which caused them to not pay their dues may have chang ed. While a number of those suspended may have moved out of state, this still leaves a sizeable pool of potential members for the lodges to contact. Through the computer system, the Grand Lodge is able to provide a lodge with the names and addresses (at the time they were suspended) of the men from their lodge who have been suspended. This listing, as well as a sample letter which may be adapted for your lodge’s use, may be obtained by calling the Grand Lodge office (319 -365 -1438) , writing to the Grand L odge of Iowa, P.O. Box 279, Cedar Rapids, IA 52406 -0279 or email: gs@gl -iowa.org . Unfinished Degrees : Virtually every lodge has brethren who have taken either the First or First and Second Degrees and never completed their degree work. For those who took their degree(s) before the proficiency was shortened, the shortened proficiency may be attractive to them. The Grand Lodge Office can provide a list of those brethren with unfinished degrees for your lodge. Contacting the person on that list and pairing them with the right mentor (coach) may produce benefits for your lodge. Affiliations : In our highly mobile society, members of the Fraternity are constantly being transferred into new areas. These brethren are interested enough in the Fraternity to conti nue paying dues even after they have moved away from their home lodge and would be a benefit to the lodge in the area in which they now reside. With dual and plural affiliations possible, these brethren have the opportunity to become involved and active i n the lodge where they now live while maintaining their ties to their home lodge if they wish. The Grand Lodge is able to provide lodges with lists of sojourners within their area who might be contacted to attend a lodge function. Whether a brother affil iates or not, in extending the hand of brotherly love and friendship, you have let the brother know that he is welcome in the community and at your lodge activities. Note: Personal contact is always the best when inviting a sojourner to a lodge function. Be sure to make every effort to make the guest feel welcome because, if you fail, your first contact may be your last. New Members : Every community in Iowa has a number of men who would be excellent members of the Fraternity. Unfortunately many of thes e men often know nothing about the Fraternity or their perception may be colored negatively by what they have heard from Masonry’s critics. An additional problem arises from the fact that Masons have traditionally been hesitant to talk about the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 Fraternit y and, in many case, even believe that they cannot speak to anyone about Masonry because that would be soliciting. Members are also unsure about what they can say; one of the best ways to stop a conversation is to ask a Mason to tell you what Masonry is. Although attracting new members may seem like a difficult problem, there are a number of ways that contacts may be made and a number of tools available to assist lodges in their efforts to gain new members. Traditionally there have been two methods of int eresting prospective members in the Fraternity: individual contacts and Friendship Nights. Individual contacts: Most people become Masons because someone they know or admire belongs to the Fraternity. The value of individual contacts should never be under estimated when the lodge is endeavoring to interest prospective members. While many men do no have a ready answer when asked “What is Freemasonry?” Almost all of them can respond eloquently when asked “What does Masonry mean to you?” These personal expe riences can provide a strong testimonial for the Fraternity. A number of different written materials are also available to assist in explaining what Masonry is. The pamphlets “Opening the Door” and “What’s a Mason” provide excellent brief descriptions of the Fraternity. If a prospect wants more detailed written information about Masonry, John Robinson’s book A Pilgrim’s Path and Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry ? also provide excellent material on this question. A membership packet, containing a number of different pieces of information for prospective members in a attractive folder, is another useful tool to provide a prospect with a basic understanding of the Fraternity. These packets are available for $1.00 from the Lodge Service Committee. Several excellent videos are also available which may be shown both to the prospect and his family. Tow Iowa videos “Opening the Door” and “In the Hearts of Men” exist for this purpose. “Opening the Door” provides a look at Masonry from the words of Mas ons in varying walks of life as they relate what Masonry means to them. Another video “Friend to Friend” was recently released by the Masonic Renewal Committee. It is approximately ten minutes long and provides a general overview of Freemasonry. All th ree videos are well done and are available through the Grand Lodge Office. Friendship Nights Friendship Nights are an effort by a lodge to introduce a number of prospective members to Masonry at one time through a special evening (or morning) devoted to th at purpose. Friendship Nights have been used by a number of lodges for some time. The success of these events is usually related to the amount of time and planning that goes into preparing for the event. If a lodge is contemplating hosting a Friendship Night, two excellent aids (one in outline form, the other providing a more detailed description including sample letters) are available through the Lodge Service Committee and the Grand Lodge Office. An area that often causes problems with Friendship Night s is attendance. In many cases, the Master announces that a Friendship Night will occur and asks everyone to bring a guest. Everyone shakes his head yes, but, when the night comes, few prospects are in attendance. A Prospect Prompter has been prepared b y the Lodge Service Committee to assist in identifying potential members within the community. Setting aside time at a meeting and going over names within the community is also a good way to identify prospects. One lodge conducted a survey of businessmen within the community and issued invitations on the basis of responses given in the survey. Once names have been identified, invitations should be sent and/or brethren assigned to contact them verbally. Additional contact should be made the day before or the day of the meeting with the brother offering to provide transportation to and from the event."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"25 The Friendship Night itself should be an event that portrays a positive image both of your lodge and the Fraternity. Every effort should be made to have the lodge spotless, to emphasize the warm, friendly, family atmosphere that is typical of Masonic functions, and to have a program which is brief, informative and interesting. To provide information on Masonry, the membership packets and videos mentioned abo ve are excellent. Speakers knowledgeable about the Fraternity are also available at no cost to the lodge through the Grand Lodge Speakers Bureau by calling the Grand Lodge office. To request a speaker, please call two to three weeks in advance. Don’t tr y to combine a Friendship Night with other occasions. The evening will become too long or too involved to be successful. The final area that is key to a Friendship Night’s success is one that is often overlooked by lodges, follow -up. Within two weeks af ter the event, the brother who invited the guests should contact them and express his appreciation for their attendance. Since most people will not ask questions in a group setting, he should also ask them if they had any questions about the evening. Thi s follow - up visit provides a personal aspect and is often where a prospect will indicate his willingness to join the Fraternity. Some lodges across the state have also gained members through information gained at Masonic booths at state, country and area f airs. These booths can provide both good visibility and assist with membership when manned by brethren who are both knowledgeable and outgoing. Banners and information materials are available for these booths from the Grand Lodge office. Usually sign -up cards are available at the booth for individuals who express an interest in learning more about the Fraternity so that further contact can be made by lodge members in their local area. Membership also extends beyond the initial joining process. Many bret hren who petition the Fraternity never go any further. Keeping this number to a minimum requires a conscious effort on behalf of the lodge members. The lodge’s role in helping a candidate through his degrees requires more than the simple conferral of the degrees. A brother who is knowledgeable and understanding should be assigned to work with the candidate and encourage him in both finishing his work and becoming involved in lodge activities and functions. An effort should also be made to find the broth er’s areas of interest and expertise so that the lodge can utilize his talents in serving the lodge as much as the brother’s time and commitments allow. The same principle also applies to brethren who have been members for longer periods of time. A lodge ’s membership is probably its most underused asset. In too many cases, a limited number of brethren do too much work because nobody knows that somebody else is capable and willing to assist. A brother who is unwilling or unable to do ritual work may be a n excellent cook, handyman, or organizer. Lodge officers need to know what their member’s talents and interests are and then be willing to use them. The Skills and Talents Survey available through the Lodge Service Committee is an excellent tool to assis t in this effort. While this process is not as easy as asking for volunteers and then letting the same few individuals do all the work, it is more rewarding in terms of involvement and membership interest. In addition, many brethren have interesting hobb ies or experiences which would make an interesting program for a lodge function which can also increase lodge attendance and involvement. Utilizing the talents and abilities of the lodge’s membership will allow the lodge to plan and carry out activities wh ich interest and involve the individual Mason and his family. It also allows the lodge to become involved in community activities that increase lodge visibility and awareness within the community. The increased fellowship and sense of accomplishment that comes with successful activity and involvement will make lodge meetings and functions more interesting, rewarding and fun, which, in turn, will assist in attracting new members."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 Ritual And The Masonic Lodge Ritual is the soul of Freemasonry. Ritual i s the glue that holds a lodge together and binds Freemasons throughout the world. Without our beautiful ritual and the time honored lessons it holds, our Fraternity would be just another service club. While Masonic Lodges serve their communities, their m ost important mission is to make good men better. This is achieved through the lessons portrayed in the ritual. The ritual adds meaning and purpose to a Mason's life and sets him apart from the rest of the community. The propagation of the mystic art is a purpose for a lodge, and the solemnity and impression, created by a well rehearsed presentation of the ritual is important in the making of a Mason. Care must always be taken to preserve the seriousness and perfection of our degrees. The Worshipful Ma ster, Wardens, officers, and members must adhere to the fine examples of those who served before them and uphold the integrity of their lodge, not only for themselves but also for those yet to come. A Brief History Of The Ritual In Iowa Iowa's ritual desce nds directly from Preston of England. Preston was a man of great ability who excelled in Masonic knowledge. His work emphasized the Ancient Charges. This work was composed of the three lectures of Masonry. Brother John Hammer brought the Preston work to America in about 1793. Thomas Smith Webb received the lectures from Hammer, but deter mi ned them unsuitable for American Masonry. Webb modified the Preston work, and this work was adopted by the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. Brother Benjamin Gleason rece ived the \"Webb Work\" from Webb himself. The work was pronounced correct by the Grand Lodge of England when Gleason visited there. Gleason taught Brother John Barney of Vermont the lectures in 1817. This work was accepted by the Grand Lodge of Vermont. In 1818 Barney fully instr ucted Brother Samuel Willson in the work. Fro m 1841 to 1860 the Masonic work of Iowa was taught at the discretion of the Grand Master. At the Grand Lodge in 1859, resolutions were passed creating a Board of Custodians to procure the ancient work and exemplify it before the Grand Lodge. The first Board of Custodians invited Brother Samuel Willson to teach the \" Webb Work.\" After more than a week of instruction, the Custodians demonstrated the \"Webb Work\" at the Grand Lodge of 1854 , and Samuel Willson certified their work as correct. In May of 1865, Brother Augustus Gilbert, a Custodian, went to Vermont and made some minor corrections to the work with the aid of Samuel Willson. Later that year, Brother W.B, Langridge, another Cust odian, also conferred with Wi llson and transcribed a copy of the \"Wi llson Notes.\" These notes are the standard reference for the ritual in Iowa today and are kept safe in a vault at the Iowa Masonic Library in Cedar Rapids. Neither the \"Webb Work\" nor the \"Wi llson Notes\" contain floor work instructions. In September of 1882 the Custodians demonstrated floor movements to correspond with the work, and this became the standard floor work. The basic \"Webb Work\" has not changed in the more than 130 years that it has been used in Iowa Masonry, making it the envy of nearly every other Grand Jurisdiction. The importance that the Grand Lodge places on maintaining the purity and accuracy of the \"Webb Work\" is made clear in the Constitution Of The Grand Lodge Of I owa, Article VIII, The Work Of The Jurisdiction, Section 1. WEBB WORK. “This Grand Lodge recognizes the work and lectures as now taught by its Board of Custodians, including modifications as presented at the 159th Annual Communication of the Grand Lodg e, as the “ANCIENT WEBB WORK.” All innovations or changes in said work or lectures are forbidden. Said work together with the floor movements shall be known as the Ritual. Section 2. LODGES TO USE. “In conferring the degrees of Masonry, the subordinate lodges must strictly adhere to the work as adopted and taught in this jurisdiction.”"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"27 The \" Webb Work\" has never been changed in content, only in presentation. Since 1907, there have been only minor word changes. The Board of Custodians are in charge of t he ritual in Iowa. Through their good work and the assistance in instruction from District Lecturers (D.L.s) and Masonic Instructors (M. Is), the quality of instruction within the state has remained high. Today, the ritual is as important as in ages past and will continue to be the force that sets Masonry and Freemasons apart from other fraternal or social organizations. District L ecturers, Masonic Instructors, a nd Schools Of Instruction: If a Brother is interested in becoming a Masonic Instructor or Distr ict Lecturer, he should find a M. I. or D.L. to assist him in lea rnin g the ritual. When a Brother has worked with and learned the ritual from an M.I. or D.L., he may be recommended to the Board of Custodians for a rigid Masonic Instructor examination. The M asonic Instructor must know the Openings and Closings for each degree , how to call from Labor to Refreshment, how to Resume Labor, the First and Second Sections of the First and Third Degrees, the First Section and the esoteric work of the Second Section o f the Second Degree . The Masonic Instructor is then given three years to prove his ritual ability and learn the correct floor work. Only those M. Is who attend Regional Schools , M.I./D.L. Clubs, or the Grand Lodge School and prove their proficiency in the floor work and the ritual are made District Lecturers. Schooling does not end with the granting of a D.L. Certificate. D.L.s are required to attend at lea st , one Regional School or Grand Lodge School every three years to remain an active Instructor. The work of these dedicated men is commendable and important for those who are seeking further light in Masonry. The work of M. I. s and D.L.s is one of the most important performed in Iowa Masonry. Their task is maintaining the accuracy of the ritual and assis ting the officers and members in adhering to it. Their ability and expertise is one of the most valuable assets at the Master's disposal. Practice does make perfect. Lodge officers can improve their ritual proficiency by regularly holding schools of inst ruction under the supervision of a M.I. or D.L. The main purpose of these schools is not to teach the ritual, but rather, to correct those few wrong words a brother learned , to teach the floor movements, and bring each part together to create the entire de gree. Ritual should be learned from the instructive tongues of well informed brethren who will be ready to impart instruction as the brother is ready to receive it. Opening Lodge A lodge is opened in form to provide a transition from the outer world to th e inner harmony that should prevail within a Masonic Hall. To create this atmosphere, the officers must be proficient in their respective parts. The Opening should never be rushed but should allow time for the Craft to forget the worries of the day and fin d peace for a time among brothers. Prayer is always offered and the Pledge of Allegiance should be given. The Opening Prayer is not ritual, but the Closing Prayer is. It is the duty of the Master to Open and Close his lodge, set the Cra ft at work, and giv e them proper instruction. B y his proficiency and ability the example is set for others to emulate. For a lodge to be Opened, there must be present at least one principle officer (W.M., S.W. or J.W.) and six Master Masons. For a Stated Meeting, the six o ther Master Masons must be entitled to Vote (Chapter15 Section 5 a ). One principle officer must be in the room at all times while the lodge is at labor. If a lodge calls to Refreshment and Resumes Labor or Opens on a different degree, the lodge must be pu rged and tyled as done in the Opening. All business is conducted in the Third Degree."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 Closing Lodge Masonic Code of Iowa, Laws For Subordinate Lodges, Chapter 15, Communications Of Lodges, Section 6. When Closed. “A subordinate lodge must be closed on the same calendar day that it is opened.” Lodges are Closed in form to reinforce the lessons therein learned and to carry them out into the world. The Closing must never be omitted or rushed. It serves as a refresher for the Candidate and Craft. As stated above, the Closing prayer must always end with the ritual prayer. Conferring Degrees Each degree serves a twofold purpose: First and foremost, it is for the benefit of the Candidate; Second, it is to reinforce the lessons and symbolism for the Craft on the sidelines. In the presentation of a degree, the participants should possess a thorough knowledge of the ritual, expressed in an earnest, feeling manner, go that a deep impression is made upon the Candidate. For, in the end, that is the main object of a de gree. If, at the conclusion of the work, the Initiate is not awakened to the good, pure, true lessons exemplified, if he does not then determine to exemplify in his own life the great lessons of the institution (in short, if he does not leave the lodge a d ifferent man), he is either unfit for membership or his money has been taken and no value returned. Only competent brothers who know their parts should participate in degree work. It is wrong and irresponsible to put a member in an office or part without t horough instruction by a competent brother. No part of the ritual can be read, except those parts contained in the Iowa Monitor, and its use should be kept to a bare minimum. Ciphers (King Solomons ) are prohibited in the lodge room. Ciphers are to be used as an aid to the memory only . The Constitution Of The Grand Lodge Of Iowa, Article VIII, The Work Of The Jurisdiction, Section 4. Conferring Of Degrees. “With the exception of Grand Master’s One Day Classes, the First Section of the First and Second De grees and the First and Second Sections of the Third Degree shall be conferred upon but one person at a time. The portions of the of the work of the First and Second Degrees after reinvestment and the Monitorial Lecture and Charge of the Third Degree may, at the option of the Master, be given to more than one candidate at the same time. In no instance is any abbreviation of the work allowable, each candidate being entitled to the degrees in full. (Amended 2001)” There are many additional lectures that ma y be given. but care should be taken not to make the degree too long or to complicate the straight -forward language expressed in the work. Many times degrees do become too long, and the impact upon the candidate as well as the Craft is lost. The Charge is the last lecture to be given before the candidate is seated , except in the Second Degree where an admonition about the proficiency is given by the Master. It is always proper to ask the candidate to speak after his degree. Iowa Systematic Masonic Enlighten ment Course Each candidate must prove suitable proficiency before being advanced to the next degree. The Master should appoint a competent brother to work with the candidate on his review of the Iowa Systematic Masonic Enlightenment Course. Many lasting fr iendships are formed this way, usually between people who would never have met had it not been for Masonry. “Passport to Light” The “Passport to Light” consists of a series of meetings based on assigning a Brother to a Candidate to serve as his Mentor for a period of one year. The Master of the lodge needs to assign a Mentor to the Candidate as soon as he has been successfully balloted upon to receive the Degrees of Masonry. Through the relationship that develops, a bond is created helping the new Brothe r become enrolled"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"29 in the lodge. The “Iowa Systematic Masonic Enlightenment Course” is the sole method for determining a brother’s proficiency in an Iowa Lodge, it together with the “Passport to Light” provides the necessary structure to insure that every Candidate/Brother is properly informed about the fundamentals and workings of the Craft. Lodge Room Etiquette The proper clothing of a Mason is a plain white apron. Officers, Past Masters, and others may wear aprons appropriate to their office. The apron is always the outermost garment and never is worn under a coat. When entering or retiring from the lodge while at labor, the member should go to the west of the altar facing east if the Master is not occupied. If the Master is busy, he should go to the we st facing the Senior Warden and give the due guard and sign of the degree and quietly enter or leave. Those participating in the work should speak clearly and from the heart for the candidate to understand fully the lessons being taught. The Admonition mus t always be read before the conferral of the Second Section of the Third Degree. Our degrees are serious and no talking or roughness should be condoned. Conclusion Interest in our meetings and in our degree work is increased with degree of accuracy and imp ressiveness with which the Ritual is given. All of the orthodox teachings of Masonry are contained in the ritual, and its sublime truths are presented in such a manner that all intelligent candidates, no matter what their level of education, may grasp its meaning and admire its wondrous ability to cement us into one band of Friends and Brothers. So Mote It Be. Education Program Resources As members of the Education Committee prepare to fulfill the duties of their of ice, they should realize that a number o f different resources are available to assist them in preparing interesting and informative educational. programs for their lodge. The only bounds that should limit them are their initiative, creativity, and willingness to spend time organizing. preparing, or planning the program. Masonic Related Educational Programs A number of sources exist that can provide ready made Educational Programs with a minimum of time and effort. Educational Packet Material Each year the Lodge Service Committee prepares and sen ds to the lodges educational packets which contain. 6 -8 five to ten minute programs on a variety of topics ready for presentation at lodge functions. Usually one to two quizzes in various formats are included. Short Talk Bulletins The Short Talk Bulletin is prepared by the Masonic Service Association. Each Bulletin is a ready made, well -written eight to ten minute program on a topic of interest. They are available through the Iowa Masonic Library Articles from Masonic Jo urnals Interesting articles on almost any Masonic -related topic abound in the various Masonic Journals published around the United States and World. If you have a topic that sounds interesting to you, the librarian at the Iowa Masonic Library will probably be able to assist you in finding an article to use.

The Masonic Encyclopedias and Dictionari es are especially useful for the later purpose. This source will probably take more effort on your part. Iowa Masonic Library This is a resource that is readily available to all Iowa Masons either by visiting, by mail, or by phone. The collection is one of the best in the world, and the staff is more than willing to assist you in finding the material that you need. Masonic speakers There are a number of excellent knowledgeable Masonic speakers around the state who are willing to make presentations on a variety of topics in lodges. An excellent source of Masonic speakers is through the Grand Lodge Speakers Bureau.

Many lodges provide some very interesting and inform ative programs for their members using sources from within the community. Schools A community's school is an excellent sources for educational programs on a variety of topics. Students, faculty, administration, and school boards are all exce llent sources and are usually willing to appear before groups. Officials from City, County, Government officials at various levels can provide State or Federal Government excellent presentations about their agencies and/or programs which serve the people of your community.

Other Organizations Most communities have several organizations who work within the community. Th ey can inform your membership about their organization and efforts. This also provides them with an opportunity to learn about Masonry and what it does. (Lions, Optimists, Knights of Columbus, P.E.O., Legion, youth groups, etc.) Your membership As with Masonic -related topics, most lodges have within their membership members who have interests, hobbies, etc. outside of Masonry which would make excellent programs These are just a few of the easy to use resources that are ava ilable when planning an educational program for your lodge.

Community’s mutual commitment and it inspires the highest performance. It is Masonic to go the extra mile for one's neighbors and fellow neighbors and citizens. In building that sense of community, it becomes necessary to have a good line of communication between the Master, the officers, and the craft. Community is an inherent need for most people. We look for opportunities to belong, achieve, and learn together. Communities help us feel safe and hopeful. They give us a sense of pride, and allow us to live and work in harmony with each other. People are willing to invest a lot of themselves t o feel this way. A common characteristic for communities is the need for leadership. Communications are needed first within the lodge, and then in the greater community. First, the Master along with his officers needs to have a vision of where they hopes t he lodge will be headed in the coming year. Creating a shared vision involves a four -part process. First, the :Master must have a vision and paint a picture of the possible. Secondly, the Master must communicate his vision to everyone involved. and to do i t in a way that inspires the craft and builds commitment to the goal. Third. his job is to enable those independent, distinct voices within the lodge to be heard and to weave them together into a collective whole that is bigger than the sum of its parts. A nd finally, the Master must create an environment that allows the vision to become reality. Th e Master can communicate directly with the craft at regular meetings. However, other forms of communication are needed to inform, brothers unable to attend lodge. Four often -used ways to communicate with the craft are sending out newsletters or trestleboards, sending meeting notices. providing calendars for the year, and providing directories of the members along with other useful information. Newsletters can come in any style or format. Whether they are an elaborate desktop published composition, or a hand -written letter, or anywhere in between is not particularly important. What is important is communicating what is planned for the lodge, especially upcoming progr ams and activities, along with past accomplishments and achievements. Meeting noti ces are announcements of upcoming meetings (regular as well as special), and can be as simple or elaborate as desired. Calendars are an effective way of informing the craft o f regular meeting dates as well as special events planned throughout the year. Directories list all the members of the lodge, and may include additional information such as addresses and phone numbers. They help maintain a connection between the brothers w ho may seldom, if ever, see one another. Another form of local communication is using a calling chain to inform brothers of upcoming events. They are often used for notifying brothers of Masonic funeral services. In this ever -changing world of technology, a lodge can communicate with the craft by websites, e- mail and Internet chat . Tomorrow may bring other exciting ways of making communication even easier and more direct. Lodges can communicate in the same ways with neighboring lodges. Lodges working tog ether can increase the sense of a Masonic community, and can lead to two or more lodges working together on projects and activities."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 A second purpose of communication is to inform the world at large of the good things that a lodge does in the community. To determine the best way or ways to inform the public, it is necessary to assess the various sources available. Local newspapers, particularly in smaller communities, are usually willing to print stories, press releases and pictures for the lodge. Providin g a written text is usually most appreciated, and will help to ensure that the information is accurate. It is common that paid advertisements are used for fund raising activities. Local television and radio may use stories connected with a lodge's activiti es, particularly if there is a human -interest element. Sending our press releases to local and area media help to get attention. The public relations committee provides an outline of what a press release should look like and what information should be inc luded for maximum effectiveness. We can also communicate through our actions. When people within the community see lodge members working to keep our highways clean, assisting in community service projects, and in helping their neighbors when the need aris es, they are provided with a picture of what Masonry and your lodge stands for. Communication is necessary to create a vision that is shared by the members of the lodge. It helps to develop a common purpose. It is used to inform the craft and the community about the lodge, its programs and activities. Positive communication leads to positive attitudes. Communication promotes creating a healthy lodge. All of this leads to a pride in your lodge. It takes a little tune, but it is simple and effective. PREFACE Experience indicates that in the absence of specific directives or written instruction, constituted lodges in Iowa have done certain things in particular ways suitable to them. There are as many ways of doing things as there are lodges doing them. In orde r to attempt some form of consistency, these guidelines are published for direction where there has been little or none and to help provide some uniformity in these categories: Reception of Visitors and Guests Balloting Draping the Charter Opening and Clos ing a Lodge of Sorrow The members of the Lodge Service Committee would like to thank Brothers Cliff ord Godsey , P.G. M. , Alfred Jensen , P.G.M. , and Dennis Zahrt , P.S.G.W. , Custodians of the Work for their assistance in writing this section of the Handbook. Without their expert guidance, it would not have been possible."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"33 Guidelines For Reception Of Visitors And Guests For many years it has been recommended that the principal officers of a lodge arrive early for called and stated meetings. This also is very important for those assigned to greet and investigate visitors. When an individual arrives with whom no one present has sat in lodge, the visitor’s committee or officers should determine whether he is a visitor or a dues paying member of the lodge that ha s been away and is essentially unknown to the principals of the lodge. If he is a member of the lodge, he should be informed that he will be challenged by one of the deacons, and that this process is not a reflection on him but is rather the duty of the d eacons when they have not sat in lodge with an individual before. Informing the brother of this may save some hurt feelings or pride in the lodge room. If the individual is a visitor or guest, the first order should be to see a current dues card or a demi t that is less than one year old. The investigating committee may also use the “Test Oath” or may ask such questions (due guard and signs for the three degrees, etc.) to establish in their own minds that the visitor or guest has been Initiated, Passed, an d Raised and is qualified to attend whatever degree is being conducted at that meeting. Whatever steps are taken, every effort should be made to make the visitor feel welcome and aware that their presence is valued and appreciated. One of the examiners should be prepared to introduce the visitor by name and lodge when he is challenged by one of the deacons. (Lodges may want to use a form similar to that on page 16 of the Book of Ceremonials which can then become part of the Secretary’s minutes for that m eeting). There should not be a visitor or guest challenged inside the lodge room that someone cannot vouch for. However, should that ever occur, the Master should assign a committee of two members to retire with the visitor or guest for the purpose of exa mination. The lodge may continue with the opening unless either deacon has retired for the examination, in which case, the lodge will be at ease until the examination is complete, and the committee returns with the brother for introduction. In case a visi tor or guest arrives at the Tyler’s door after the door has been sealed, the Tyler is responsible for the proper examination of the brother before alarming the lodge and seeking permission for him to enter. If the Tyler is unable to make such a decision, the visitor shall be turned away or the Master informed so that he may appoint a committee to further examine the individual. This process should be worked out at the beginning of the year by the Worshipful Master and Tyler. Guidelines For Balloting After the Worshipful Master or Secretary reads the required information from the petition, the Worshipful Master says, “Brother Senior Deacon,” (Senior Deacon rises, takes his rod in his right hand, and turns to face South ), “prepare the ballot box” or “spread the ballot.” With the rod in his right hand, the Senior Deacon moves as required to obtain the ballot box and checks to be sure that there are no cubes or balls in the secret compartment and that there are adequate balls and cubes for the ballot. Keepin g his rod in his right hand and the ballot box in his left, he moves counter clockwise and crosses West of the altar to the Junior. Warden, on to the Senior Warden, and back to the Worshipful Master. Each, in turn, determines that no ballots are in the se cret compartment and that adequate balls and cubes are in the voting compartments for the ballot. (Reference Figure 1 ) Having done this the Master announces, “Brethren, we are voting on the petition of Mr. ________ _________ for the degrees of Masonry i n (Name of Lodge) Lodge No. (Number) . Remember, white balls elect, and black cubes reject. Be careful of your ballot and vote only for the good of the Fraternity.” (OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT) After the announcement, the Master votes first. The Senior D eacon moves counter clockwise to the Senior Warden who votes next, then to the Junior Warden’s station to allow him to vote and finally"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 to the altar or a small table set South of the altar where he sets the ballot box with the voting side facing West and v otes himself. The Senior Deacon then faces West and moves at least four paces from the altar. (Reference Figure 2) He turns again so that he is facing south and tilts his rod forward to serve as a gate. The members sitting on the south side who are enti tled to vote led by the Secretary line up West of the tilted rod. The Senior Deacon retracts the rod to a vertical position allowing the Secretary to approach the ballot box and vote. After the Secretary has voted, the Senior Deacon retracts his rod agai n allowing the next in line to vote. This continues until all in the South have balloted. The Treasurer then leads all of those on the North side of the lodge who are entitled to vote to the West of the Senior Deacon and the same process is followed unti l all of those on the North side have balloted. The Tyler is/may be included if a brother that has voted relieves him of his duties outside the door while he votes. It is always permissible for the Senior Deacon to carry the ballot to Brothers on the sid elines that are infirm in any way . If the Senior Deacon forgot to vote after the Junior Warden, he may vote after the last brother in line has cast his ballot. After the last brother has voted, the Worsh ipful Master asks, “Have all voted who are entitled (required) to vote?” The Secretary monitors the ballot as only current members of that lodge are eligible to vote, and the Secretary has the membership register. The Secretary responds, “All have voted.” The Worshipful Master announces, “I declare the bal lot closed” (Gives one knock) Brother Senior Deacon, bear the ballot box to the South, West, and return it to the East.” ( Reference Figure 3) The Junior Warden rises as the Senior Deacon presents the ballot box, inspects the contents of the secret side, and remains standing. The Senior Deacon bears the ballot box to the Senior Warden where the same inspection process is repeated. He then bears the ballot box to the East where the Master inspects the ballot as in the South and West. If the Worshipful M aster determines the ballot is clear or contains more than one negative vote, he asks, “How do you find the Ballot in the South, Brother Junior Warden?” The Junior Warden replies, “Clear/not clear/ cloudy, or dark (whichever applies) in the South, (Sign) Worshipful Master.” The Worshipful Master asks the Senior Warden, “How do you find the Ballot in the West, Brother Senior Warden?” The Senior Warden replies, “Clear/not clear, cloudy, or dark (whichever applies) in the West, ( Sign ) Worshipful Master.” The Worshipful Master then says, “And clear/not clear, cloudy, or dark in the East.” If clear, he says, “Brethren, you have elected Mr. ______ __________ to receive the degrees of Masonry in _________ Lodge No. _____.” If not clear (with more than one black cube) he says, “Brethren, you have rejected the petition of Mr. _______ ________ for the degrees of Masonry.” If only one negative vote (black cube) appears, the Master does not ask nor declare the result but orders a reballot by destroying the ballot. The vote on the second ballot shall be declared and be final. After the declaration by the Master, he shall order the Senior Deacon to destroy the ballot. It is the duty of the Secretary to notify the petitioner of the action on his petition."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"35 S E W SD SD Figure 3 S E W SD SEC SD xxxxxx Figure 2 S E W SD Figure 1"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 Guidelines For Draping The Charter The Charter of a lodge is draped in black or purple upon the death of a Past Grand Master. The Charter is draped for a period of (usually) thi rty days after his obituary is read in open lodge at a Stated Communication following the receipt of an order of the current Grand Master. The means of compliance to this order are as numerous as there are lodges in Iowa. Each lodge should have a suitable drape for their charter. The Worshipful Master may order the drape to be applied by the Secretary, Senior Deacon, Marshal, or any other brother that he may designate after the notice is read in open lodge. After the designated time has passed, the Maste r will order the undraping of the charter. It is the practice of some lodges to drape the Charter, Altar, or Great Lights on the death of a member or to conduct an annual memorial service with them draped. No restrictions exist on such memorial practices. Guidelines For Opening And Closing A Lodge Of Sorrow REFERENCES: Book of Ceremonials pa ges 129 -139 ; In the past on the day of the memorial service or burial service, lodges were opened as a called Lodge of Sorrow on the Master Mason’s Degree. The funera l or burial service was conducted, and the brethren returned to the lodge and closed the Lodge of Sorrow. This is the most generally accepted format. Because of the difficulty of gathering a suitable number of brethren for this purpose on short notice, the Code of Iowa allows lodges to provide , by resolution or an amendment to their by -laws, for an annual Lodge of Sorrow. Masonic Code of Iowa , Chapter 39 “Masonic Burials ,” Section 3 c “ Annual Lodge of Sorrow ” A lodge may provide by resolution or amen dment to the bylaws for an annual lodge of sorrow. Such lodge of sorrow may be opened in regular form any time after the installation of officers and remain open for the purpose of conducting funeral and memorial services during the term of office, Chapte r 15, Section 6 of the Laws for Subordinate Lodges notwithstanding. The Master shall close the lodge of sorrow in regular form before the end of his term. Minutes shall be kept by the Secretary of the lodge. These minutes shall be read in the same manne r as minutes of a called communication at the next stated communication for correction and approval. After the Worshipful Master is installed and has conducted and closed his first regular meeting for the year, he may Open a lodge of Master Masons and desi gnate it as a annual Lodge of Sorrow. The Lodge of Sorrow is left open until after the closing of the last stated meeting of the year (or before the end of the Master’s term) when the Master closes the Lodge of Sorrow on the Master Mason Degree (Not by de claration and not as part of the stated communication). This may leave the lodge with the necessity of Opening and Closing a Lodge of Sorrow for each death between the Closing of the annual Lodge of Sorrow in the old year, and the Opening of the annual Lo dge of Sorrow in the new year."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"37 The Grand Lodge is Coming Grand Lodge Officer Reception 1.

It is by the existe nce of the Grand Lodge that the subordinate lodges within Iowa derive the right to exist and function. Similarly, the Grand Lodge could not exist without its constituent lodges, and its actions are merely a reflection of their combined will at the state l evel. The Grand Lodge is made up of each of its officers, each past elective officer while a member of one of its subordinate lodges, each member of its boards and standing committees, and the Worshipful Master, Senior Warden, and Junior Warden of each of its chartered lodges. In 1997 there are approximately 1200 members of the Grand Lodge, each with one vote. Each year the Grand Lodge meets in its annual communication on the third weekend (Friday and Saturday) in September. The location for Grand Lodge rotates between five cities: Waterloo, Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Sioux City, and Davenport. However, the Grand Master may change the location for sufficient reason as was done in 1996 and 2001 when Grand Lodge was held in Dubuque instead of Davenport. T he Master and Wardens of each lodge or their proxies are encouraged to attend each of these meetings because this is where the leadership for Iowa Masonry for the ensuing year is determined and decisions on legislation are made that affect your lodge, its members, and the course of Masonry in Iowa. The Grand Lodge Session also provides an opportunity to enjoy fellowship, meet and share ideas with brethren from across the state and learn information through seminars and other activities which will be useful to you as you plan your year and serve your lodge. The Masonic Code of Iowa is the law which governs Iowa Masonry. Unlike some other jurisdictions, in Iowa, Grand Masters are not allowed to issue edicts which supersede the Code. By - laws provide the ru les which govern each individual subordinate lodge and provide the guidelines under which the officers of the lodge must operate. Those by -laws must, at all times, be in accordance with the Code of Iowa. The Grand Lodge Officers provide a visible face f or Iowa Masonry during the Grand Lodge year. Officers are installed at the end of one year’s Grand Lodge Session and serve until the end of the ensuing year’s session. The five elected officers are the Grand Master, Senior Grand Warden, Junior Grand Ward en, Grand Treasurer, and Grand Secretary. They and the ten appointed officers travel around the state assisting with the Laying of Cornerstones, Temple Dedications, Third Degrees, lodge celebrations and other ceremonial activities. These brethren and thei r ladies contribute a great deal of time and energy toward serving Iowa Masonry during their year as a Grand Lodge Officer. With the exception of the Grand Master and two full -time Grand Lodge employees, most of their travel is at their own expense. The Grand Master is the supreme executive authority of Iowa Masonry. If a lodge, by necessity, has to hold their election of officers at a time other than at the November Stated Meeting, if they wish to hold their installation of officers at a time other tha n prescribed by the Code, or move their charter for a special occasion, the Grand Master must issue a dispensation before any action can occur. He also has the power to settle disputes involving the construction and application of Masonic laws subject to the review of the Grand Lodge. The Grand Master presides over the Grand Lodge Session and any other function during the year when Grand Lodge is Opened. He also attends all Grand Lodge Committee sessions and represents the Grand Lodge at meetings with af filiated bodies, other Grand Lodge sessions in neighboring states, and at the Midwest Conference and the Conference of Grand Masters. He receives a stipend to assist him with some of the expenses that he incurs as Grand Master. To be a Grand Master, a b rother must be a member of an Iowa lodge and a Master or Past Master of a lodge (this also applies to the offices of Deputy Grand Master and the Wardens). The Grand Master is addressed as Most Worshipful Brother_________ or Most Worshipful Grand Master."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"41 The Senior Grand Warden, Junior Grand Warden, Grand Treasurer, and Grand Secretary are elected positions. The nominees for these positions are selected at a meeting of Past and Present Elective Grand Lodge Officers that is held in Des Moines between April 1 and May 15. Since Iowa does not have a progressive line, they do not advance at the end of their terms. However, all past elective Grand Lodge officers remain as members of the Grand Lodge and are entitled to vote as long as they are members of an Iowa lodge. They are addressed formally as Right Worshipful Brother ________. Although they are appointed by the Grand Master rather than elected, the Deputy Grand Master and Grand Chaplain are also addressed as Right Worshipful Brother. The brethren filli ng those positions are not entitled to vote after the conclusion of their year in office unless they are elected to a higher office. The Marshal, Deacons, Stewards, Tyler, and Grand Musician are appointed by the Grand Master and addressed as Worshipful Br other _________. Like the Deputy Grand Master and Grand Chaplain, their active membership in the Grand Lodge is only for their term of office unless they are later elected to a higher office. The Grand Secretary is charged with keeping the records and acc ounts of the Grand Lodge. His office is the body which has the most contact with the constituent lodges throughout the year as he deals with the lodge Secretaries and Masters in maintaining the records of the Grand Lodge. Any correspondence or dealings w ith lodges from other Grand Jurisdictions must go through his office. He also provides a series of ten Secretaries’ Conferences during the year. The Grand Lodge Office in Cedar Rapids (Ph: 319 -365 -1438 or email: gs@gl -iowa.org ) is a useful source of infor mation for lodge officers . The Office is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M. and from 1:00 P.M. until 5:00 P.M. The Grand Lodge Administrative Offices are also home to the Grand Lodge Library and Museums.
