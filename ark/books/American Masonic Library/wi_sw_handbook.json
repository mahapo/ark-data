With rare exceptions, no higher honor can come to any man. \"He that is Master must serve,\" sa id a 17th century poet and these six simple words spell out the rule and guide to success for the Master of a Masonic Lodge. \"Serve\" is the keyno te; but to serve effectively requires a solid background of thorough preparation. If there is a secret to a successful year in the East, it lies in the planning thereof. Your achievements as a Master will depend almost entirely upon preparations made before the first rap of your gavel in the East. This guide is presented to you by the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Wisconsin in the sincere hope that it will provide you with some help as you plan for your coming year so th at you will be able to fulfill your duties and discharge your obligations with honor, reputation and personal satisfaction! The numerous duties and responsibilities that will become yours when you are elevated to the Master's station extend far beyond the conferring of degrees and the conducting of the business of the stated communications. They touch the life of every member and r each into the community, the Grand Lodge, the Wisconsin Masonic Home, the State and sometimes farther. The future of Masonry in your community and in the State of Wisconsin is greatly influenced by your actions, more importantly, so is every man who enters your l odge; therefore, it behooves yo u to exert every effort to make your term of office a successful one. \"No man should begin any great and glorious undertaking with out first invoking the blessi ng of deity.\" In the peace and quiet of your own home we urge you to heed this advice. In his admonition to Timothy, Paul the Apostle said, \"study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly divining the word of Truth.\" If we may be pardoned for the liberty of paraphrasing these words, this same injunction could well be delivered to the Worshipful Master when he is s eated in the Oriental Chair, “study to show thyself approved unto God and the brethren, a workman that needeth not be ashamed of the way he deals with Truth.\" With equal emphasis, you are urged to seek the wisdom and counsel of your predecessors. Some lodges have \"Planning Guides\" for their Wardens, which contain the prac tical experiences of the Mast ers who have preceded them. You should seek these out and read them early in your year. If your lodge has no such guide for the Wardens, you might think seriously of starting one so that your successor may have the benefit of your experience. Talk to the Past Masters of your lodge and of other lodges and sift their collective ideas for wisdom (but do not hesitate to discard the chaff). Make no mistake about it: Intelligent men are not going to spend their evenings hearing the minutes read and the bills allowed, or watching other men exemplify poorly the same ritualistic work they have seen a score of times. When men are interested in the work of an organization, th ey will be on hand to participate in its program. When there is nothing that interests them, they will not be there no matter how much we nag. Unless Freemasonry presents what it has to offer in a cha llenging manner, intelligent men will not be on the sidelines to witness and participate. Old St. Andrew's Lodge in Boston did not have a very large membership on a memorable evening in 1773. No, the Lodge even met in rented quarters. It did not have much in the way of numbers, but it had the men who counted. Attendance is not the ultimate. Size is not the ultimate. An imposing temple is not the ultimate- In Freemasonry; there is no substitute for quality. When a Lodge has membership of quality, good leadership w ill be in command. If good leadership is in command, the Lodge program will be challenging, and in the best of Masonic traditions. If the Lodge program is challenging and thoroughly Masonic, there will be interest among the members. And if there is interest among the members, they will be in attendance. The Brethren The Master's first responsibility is to the welfare of the brethren. The program, which he lays out, should contain entertainment and education for the members of the lodge. All t oo often we hear the phrase, \"T his is an officer's lodge.\" What is meant is that the officers in th eir preoccupation with lodge business and degree work have failed to give proper consideration and attention to the members of the lodge. Often they have literally forgotten where their primary responsibility rests. Nothing is deadlier to a lodge. A Greeting At The Door When a brother, member or visitor, comes to lodge the Master should be there to greet him. Plan on arriving at least one-half hour before the lodge is scheduled to open and to be at the door to greet everyone right up to the last minute; this means that you should have everything organized beforehand so that you are free to spend that half hour talking to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 the members and visitors. Let each man know how much his pres ence is appreciated by greetin g him enthusiastically and calling him by name. See that any new member or visitor has a brother assigned to sit with him in lodge and to see that he is introduced around. Remember that every man, regardless of his station in life, needs to be loved. Let him know that he is. Letters To The Brethren If you want to be remembered, write two letters to the memb ers of your lodge during your year. This personal contact will mean more than you can imagine. Include some highlights of your program for the year and some details of interest to out-of-state brethren. If you use your mailing permit the cost is negligible but the warmth of the reception will surprise you. How many letters have you received from past Masters? Education Of The Brethren \"What came you here to do?\" we ask our candidates. Their answer implies that there will be opportunities for them to improve themselves in Masonry. How many such opportunities does -your lodge present? Masonry is not a glorified fratern ity but a philosophy of life into wh ich these members have now entered - a philosophy of life, which can build for the world a more secure and durable society th rough the betterment of the individual man. \"Masonic teaching is basically a re-affirmation of the absolute necessity of morality in all the relationships, which exist and develop in the processes we call civilization. . . True morality grows out of recognition that men must commit themselves to some fundamental principles of action and behavior if the fabric of civilization is to have any durability and meaning. . . Without commitment to some standards of rectitude and justice, there can be no faith in the value of cooperative efforts to build a society, which will fit a definition of civilization. The spiritual tragedy of modern man lies in his fear that society has discarded such faith.\" So said M ∴ W ∴ Brother Conrad Hahn of The Masonic Service Association in 1965. Through the improvement and strengthening of the character of the individual man, Freemasonry seeks to improve the community. Thus it impresses upon its members the principles of personal righteousness and personal responsibility, enlightens them as to those things, which make for human welfare, and inspires them with that feeling of charity, or good will, toward all mankind, which will move them to translate principle and conviction into action. Does your lodge do this? For all too many years the Masoni c Fraternity has failed to pr operly educate its members. How many times have we inducted candidates into various degrees and then forgotten them as they emerge from the temple of Masonry? It is the responsibility of ev ery Master to see that his lodge program incl udes true Masonic Education. In the next section of this booklet are a number of suggestions, which may be useful in this area of your planning. A Charge To The Brethren Every man needs to be reminded periodically of his responsibilities. As the Master of your lodge you can do much to enrich the lives of the members of your lodge if you remind th em of their obligations. An Ancient Charge of the Master given to the Brethren is an example of what a dedicat ed and imaginative Master can do for the brethren - to remind them of their Masonry. Ancient Charge of Worshipful Master to Brethren Brethren, we are about to quit this sacr ed retreat of friendship and virtue, to mix again with the world. Amidst its concerns and employments, forget not the duties, which you have heard so frequently inculcated, and so forcibly recommended, in this Lodge. Be Diligent, Prudent, Temperate, and Discreet. Remember th at around this Altar you have promised to befriend and relieve every brother who sh all need your assistance. You have promised, in the most friendly manner, to remind him of his errors, and aid his reformation. These generous principles you are to extend farther, every human being has a claim upon your kind offices; do good unto all. We recommend it more especially to the \"Household of the Faithful\" . Finally, my Brethren, be you all of one mind to live in ha rmony and may the God of Love and Peace abide with you. Such a charge or similar reminder after the Lodge is closed but before it is dismissed is recommended for your consideration. Part 7 of the Appendix of the Masonic Code of Wisconsin contains \"The Charges of a Free-Mason\" and should be well known to all brethren and particularly th e officers. The charges are outlined as follows: "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 The Charges of a Freemason Extracted From The ancient RECORDS of Lo dges beyond Sea and of those in England, Sc otland, and Ireland, for the Use of the Lodges in London. To Be Read At the making of New Brethren, or when the MASTER shal1order it. The General Heads, Viz: I. Of God and Religion. II. Of the Civil Magistra te supreme and subordinate. III. Of Lodges. IV. Of Masters, Wardens, Fellows, and Apprentices. V. Of the Management of the Craft in working. VI. Of Behavior, viz. 1. In the Lodge while constituted. 2. After the Lodge is over and the Brethren not gone. 3. When Brethren meet without Strangers, but not in a Lodge. 4. In Presence of Strangers not Masons. 5. At Home and in the Neighborhood. 6. Towards a Stranger Brothers. The Trestle Board – Communications with the Brethren Some Lodges publish a trestleboard on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, others on a quarterly or semi-annual. In many cases, it is the only communication with ma ny members. If the Lodge meets in a Multi Lodge Bldg. it may be part of a larger Trestle Board. In any case its im portance to you as the Master cannot be understated. Because many men have commitments to family, church and other community activitie s your Trestle Board should tell them the Lodges \"work and play\" schedule. Be sure to list major events at least 2months in advance. A \"Masters Message\" lets you report to the brethren what has happened or is about to happen. Rememb er the brother who can't be there every meeting is still a brother and wants to know what the Lodge is doing. When rapid communication with the brethren is need ed there are at least 2 ways, which can be used. 1. A pre-arranged telephone committee to call the brethren. 2. An automatic telephone answerer. An automatic telephone answerer whereby the brothers could learn what is going on at lodge or leave a message for the Master at any time, 24 hours of the day, simply by dialing an unlisted number (typed on the back of their dues card, for example) would greatly improve lodge communications. The Master can change the message at a moments notice, thereby helping to spread the word quickly. Those who want to know what's going on, can! Chapter 89 of the Masonic Code of Wisconsin provides regulations for publication of members or candidates names. It would appear, however, that an unlisted telephone number, which the members could call and receive a recorded message, would be a proper form in which to disclose a candidate's name and any other information such as deaths, memorials, funerals and other lodge functions. Automatic Telephone Answerers with 30 to 60 second answering tapes and 30-call capacity can be purchased. Sample 30-second Message \"Greetings Brother! This Thursday we are conferring the Fellowcraft Degree on Brother James Bond - come up and give him your welcome and support! A free dinner will be served at 6:3O and the degree work will begin at 7:00, Remember that Brother Bill Early of Wilmont Products received his EA last week and could use your help on the lesson. See y ou Thursday! If you would like a ride to Lodge leave your name and address after the tone. We'll be in touch to verify the time.\" As you see, one can get across a lot of information in 30 seconds. Only rarely w ill you need a 60-second tape. Masonic News Publications Some Lodges or groups of Lodges have their own Masoni c News publications. It is a place where the Master can send a message to all the members of His Lodge. He can put in his calendar for the month and any other news items he deems necessary. Many members find that it is their only contact with their Lodge and without, it they would become disinterested and drop out. Most member s look forward to receiving th eir Masonic News. The price is small compared to the benefits that are received. With advertising, the cost per member per month can be less than 6 or 7 cents. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Joint Publications There are many advantages to be gleaned from a joint Masonic News publication wherein several lodges in close proximity (thirty-mile radius) band together to issue a single news publication. This would be particularly helpful to the small lodges because it can promote visitations from neighbor ing towns. This could also be by Area or District. By virtue of the familiarity which such a joint publication provides, closer kinship results between the officers and members of the various bodies. Greater opportunity is provided for cross visitation' and hence improved attendance. Concomitantly, the larger circulation is of more interest to advertisers and permits cheaper mailing rates. The smaller lodges are strongly urged 'to consider such a publication if none such presently exists. Mailing Permit Information Publication 13 of the United States Postal Service provides information on the various mailing permits available. A brief synopsis pertinent to your needs appears below. If your mailing exceeds 1000 persons, you can send a \"Masonic News\" publication under a second class permit provided it is printed (not mimeographed). If your mailing exceeds 200 persons you may send your letters and \"Masonic News\" under a third class permit. The addresses must be 100% zip coded and sorted and a form must be submitted in duplicate with the mailing. All mailings must be prepaid by having money on account or else a meter or meter stamp must be saved. For additional information please see the above circular (Publication 13-USPS) and check for current costs. The Wisconsin Masonic Journal This is the official monthly publication of \"The Grand Lodge Free & Accepted Masons of Wisconsin.\" Every Master Mason should be receiving a copy monthly. If not have your Secretary contact the Ed itor. If your lodge has a contribution of material send all correspondence addressed to: The Wisconsin Masonic Journal 36275 Sunset Drive Dousman, WI 53118 Telephone: (414) 965-2200 1-800-242-2307 The Wisconsin Masonic Journal is regulated by Chapter “45” of the Wisconsin Masonic Code. ' Public Relations and Communications Introduction Keeping Freemasonry in the news is very important to the Fraternity and to your Lodge regardless of it's size or location. It is through the news media and publications that men who are not Masons learn what Masons think and do. The Master or someone whom he delegates should consider it one of his most important duties to get legitimate news stories to the newspapers and to the television and radio stations. Personal contact with representatives of the news media is highly desirable. If the Master or His Deputy does not have such contact he should go to the editor or news director and ask for assistance. Preparing Material Many Masonic events are sufficiently important to warrant personal coverage by the news media. I t is up to the Lodge representative to keep newsmen informed of upcoming events. But in many instances Masonic activities will not warrant personal coverage by newsmen. Th en it is up to the Lodge representatives to prepare and deliver the information to the news media. Given a good personal relationship, the Mason many times will find he can deal with the newsmen by telephone. Remember to say \"Thank you.\" Say it often, this can help you and pay big dividends in your contacts with them. . Tell it as it Happened Wh o, What, When, Where, Why. Sample News Release On Wednesday (Date) John Smith a member of (Name) Lodge (#)F. & A.M. will be recognized by the Hospital Board of Directors for his efforts on behalf of the hosp ital during the last 5 years at a dinner etc. After you have written your news release, check to see that it answers the basic questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 Masons and Non Masonic Friends A little booklet is available from the Grand Secretaries O ffice which answers the most frequently asked questions about Masonry in Wisconsin. Because of its importance we have re produced its content, which follows. What About Freemasonry? It has never been possible to determine the exact origin of Freemasonry. Some scholars have attempted to trace Masonry back to Biblical days or even before. Freemasonry is the oldest and largest fraternity in the world. What Is Freemasonry? It is an organization of men based on the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man, using builder’s tools as symbols to teach basic moral truths. It applies the principles of operative Masonr y and architecture to the science and art of character building, whic h by its teachings and ceremonials makes goo d men better and thereby makes the world a better place in which to live. What Do Masons Stand For? The fraternity of Freemasonry embraces men bound together by vows of mora lity in public and private life who believe in God; promotes patriotism and respect for the Constitution; believes in the right of members to free choice of religion and political persuasion; sanctions equal rights under the law; and practices good will toward all men. What Does Masonry Offer To Society? , Although Masonry was not established as a benefit society or a charitable institution, it does assist members by many means through times of hardship. Its basic tenets are Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. These tenets charge us to give thought and time to the aid of others, to visit the sick, to sympathize with the unfortunate, and particularly to exercise tolerance toward those whose opinions or beliefs may differ from ours. All branches of Freemasonry practice various forms of charity or benevolence to society. Is Freemasonry A Religion? No. An institution \"erected to God\" which begins its ceremoni es and ends its meetings with prayer, which has a Holy Book upon its altar, which teaches the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherho od of Man, has a religious character. Therefore, 'no atheist can be made a Mason. However, Maso nry is not a church, a religion, or a substitute for one. Masonry has no creed, has no priesthood, is nonsectarian, and is not an offspring of any church - ancient or modern. ' How Does Masonry Differ From Religion? Freemasonry seeks to make good men better; religion functioning through the churches seeks to reform men who may have succumbed to the temptations of life. Freemasonry does not propose to reform sinners or to teach salvation, and is no substitute for a church. Religious men go to church to worship God; men do not go to a Masonic Lodge for the purpose of worship. They go to a Masonic Lodge to learn moral truths and how to apply them in their everyday life. They find that one compliments the other. Masonry encourages its members to be active in the church of their choice. Is Freemasonry a Secret Society? No. A secret society, among ot her things, meets in a secret place. Masonic lodges usually occupy prominent locations in the community and their Temples customarily are iden tified by a display of one or more well-known Masonic emblems. Most members of the Craft wear Masonic insi gnia. The only secrets of Freemasonry are its methods of recognition. What Are The Requirements For Membership? A man of good moral character, having a belief in a Supreme Being is eligible to apply for membership in the Masonic fraternity. What Is The Masonic Organization? Freemasonry consists of the Symbolic or Blue Lodge, which confers three basic degrees. There are also many organizations, which restrict their membership to, Masons. They are sometimes called \"appendant' bodies.\" One group is called the York Rite, another is called the Scottish Rite. What Is The Shrine?  '  The Shrine is an organization of Masons who must first belong to the Scottish Rite or York Rite. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 How Do You Become A Freemason? If you are interested in becoming a Freemason, you should tell a Mason of your wish to become a member. He will assist you to obtain a petition and advise you how to procee d. Freemasonry does not seek members through solicitations or membership drives. The individual must make known his desire to become a Mason. Why You Are Not Asked To Become A Member? Every act a Mason performs as a Mason or in the name of Masonry, and throughout his entire Masonic life, is the\" result of his \"own free will and accord.\" It follows therefor e, that even a man's first approach to the Fraternity must be upon the same basis - a voluntary act, unbiased by solicitation from any member. ' What Procedure Follows Acceptance? Upon being accepted for membership in a Symbolic Lodge, a candidate IS taught the basic tenets of Masonry in three degrees. \"These degrees are first, Entered Apprentice; se cond, Fellow Craft; third Master Mason. They consist of ceremonies of a serious nature in which each candidate takes part with dignity and solemnity. How Many Masons Are There? In Wisconsin there are approximately 17,000 Master Masons who belong to nearly 200 Masonic Lodges. There are approximately 2 million Master Mason’s in the United States and more than 4 million Master Masons in the world. Freemasonry is, therefore, not only the oldest but , also the largest fraternity in the world. The Officers Introduction No Mason should begin climbing the flight of win ding 'stairs to the Masters Chair in the East without first pledging to himself that he will dedicate and devote all his energy and zeal, that he might fulfill all th e duties of each office he will hold to the absolute best of his ability. The system of Historic Precedent adopted in almost all Symbolic Lodges whereby the Steward with the most seniority is el ected Junior Deacon, the Junior Deacon is elected Senior Deacon, et cetera. is a fertile breeding ground for the insidious disease of indifference. When there is no competition for an office, when no candidate must prove himself more qualified or prepared than another to assume a chair, pride can and does get lost. Indifference will sit on an officer's lap, soothing him, caressing him, holding him in a half-world where he serves neither himself nor his Lodge, leading him by the hand by the easiest way possible to the Past Masters club. Each officer must solemnly and sincerely promise and swear to himself th at he will fulfill the obligations and perform the duties of his station better than they have been done by any other since he has been a member of his Lodge. And, when elevated, will do better than the Brother now serving. The Stewards should greet visitors and introduce them to Brothers present so that when they become Deacons they will not be self-consc ious or embarrassed when performing this duty in a tiled Lodge. So too must the Deacons and Wardens observe all the subtleties of their next stations, not only that they might perform their necessary duties well, but that they may be ab le to add their special personalities, the strength that separates leaders from common officers. Pride begets pride; enthusiasm spawns enthusiasm. Just as a school will relate with its varsity team, so too will the members of a Lodge relate with its officers. If the vars ity, even when losing, displays all the virtues of true sportsmanship both on and off the fi eld, if the players give all they have to give and are beaten only because they lack height or weight or, special physical dexterity, their fans will still be behind them and loaded fan busses will follow them to the ends of the Earth. So too with the Lodge. When Officers display the virtues of enthusiasm for their station and pride of accomplishment, the membership will be more willing to support them in all their endeavors. When all officers display a sincere love and concern for the Craft, respect for the Brothers, and humility with their authority, Masonry must prosper. If the officers of a Lodge are a team, then the Master mu st be coach, manager, traine r, cheerleader, bat boy and sweepers helper. First and foremost he must inspire by pr ecept and example. No Master can demand of any Steward, Deacon, or Warden, better workmanship th an he himself did there. Remember th is as you move through the chairs; only if you were a true and faithful workman as a Deacon can y ou demand your Deacon to be a true and faithful workman. Establish a code of proprieties and ethics for the officers and demand faithful and strict adherence. Slouching in your chair suggests slouching in planning or administration; sloppy dress suggests sloppy execution. \"Look sharp, feel sharp, stay sharp,\" It is also the specific duty of every offi cer to attend Schools of Instruction and participate in the work of the School as assigned by the Grand Lecturer. The importance of proficiently and conscientiously conferring the degrees in the lodge cannot be overemphasized. Masonry must be made meaningful to a candidate in the E.A. degree; therefore sincerity, dignity, and exactness should be employed to assure that he receives only the best. Levity, frivo lity, and disturbances should not be countenanced. Avoid whispering, laughing, or chuckling no candidate comes this way but once and he"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 should see and hear the best work that we have to offer. Attend and participate in Masonic funeral and memorial services. Make a special effort to encourage as many members to attend as possible. Attention should be given to the proper attire of all officers to maintain the dignity, which is one of the heritages of the craft. Dark suits, white shirts, and dark ties are most impre ssive and dark hats for the Master. Avoid sport shirts, caps, and straw hats whenever possible. Duties of the Officers 1. Worshipful Master Of the many duties and responsibilities assumed by the Master at his installation, some are quite obvious but will bear repeating. There are also some duties which, in order to be discharged efficiently, must be thought about and often some action taken before being installed as Master. Thes e will be discussed in the paragraphs to follow. 1. Very carefully and thoroughly revi ew the charges to be made at the installation by consulting the Installation Ceremonies. See Grand Master Most Worshipful Robert E. Billings letter of Oct. 7, 1975 which established the current installation ceremony. When being installed, assent will be requested to these charges and one could not be installed without this assent. Hence the absolute necessity of a constant review of these charges to assure conformity and to avoid any violation of the obligation assumed at installation. 2. Study and be sure you understand the Powers of a Master defined in Chapter 56.06 of the Code as well as Chapters 51 thru 100 - Regulations for Lodges. 3. Open and Preside Over the Lodge . Opening and closing a lodge should be done, of course, in a dignified and ritualistically skillful manner. We are not necessarily suggesting that the. Master mu st be the most proficient ritualist in his lodge: but we are suggesting that he become as proficient as it is possi ble to do. The impression created while opening a lodge can and will remain a long time. . In presiding over the lodge he should follow the prescribed order of business and be well in formed on the more commonly used points of parliamentary law. He has assu med duties, privileges and responsibilities, which are not accorded the presiding officer of any othe r society. All others preside, but do not govern. He does both, and from his decisions and orders there is no appeal to the lodge. Only the Grand Master and/or the Grand Lodge can overrule such decisions and orders. He should, theref ore, be especially careful to see th at his decisions are wise and just. Within the society of a Masonic Lodge the Master has been endowed with considerable power. These are enumerated and discussed, along with the limitations in some detail in the Code. Be certain that these are well in mind. These powers have not been established as a means of enhancing personal glory but rather to furnish an opportunity for rendering service; but these powers must be understood in order that they may use them properly. Brother Carl Claudy (former Secretary of the Masonic Service Associ ation of the U.S.A.) once said, \"The Master who does not know his powers cannot use them intelligently; but the Master who knows what he may not lawfully do will lead with wisdom, discretion, and success,\" In presiding over the lodge, punctuality is extremely important. When the appointed hour arrives, begin the opening. The Brethren will soon learn that the meetings begin promptly. Conduct the business portion of the meeting expeditiously. At best, this is not always the most interes ting experience. Cover all the business but try to plan some attempts at \"streamlining\" the business portion to make it more palatable. As an example – in recording and subsequently reading the minutes of the previous communication, it shouldn't be necessary to state, \"The following bills were read and by motion passed were approv ed,\" and then proceed to read individually each of the bills which already have been approved and paid. Suffice it to say, \"Bills in the amount of $ were read and by motion passed were approved.\" The Brethren are anxious to begin the program or, retire to the Social Hall for fellowship. In the section of this guide titled Lodge Organization and Administration are some suggestions on conducting the Regular and Special Comm unications of a Lodge. 4. Chairman of Finance Committee The Wisconsin Masonic Code Chapter 62.0 4 provides that each lodge shall have a Finance Committee consisting of the Master, Senior and J unior Wardens, The basic responsibilities of this Committee are discussed in the section of this guide on Committees. Howe ver. be sure you are familiar with Grand Master Carl A, Garny's letter on procedures for suspension. Chapter 62.04 of the Code also states: \"The Finance Commi ttee shall annually present a budget to the Lodge for its consideration\" prior to the fixing of the dues for the ensuing year. 5. Appointing New Officers . Even though it is the responsibility of the Master to choose the appointed officers, this must be done before a Warden has been installed as Mast er: and as succeeding wardens will probably be working with"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 new appointees it may be well to discuss such appointments with the Junior Warden. Officer selections (not appointments) should be made well in advance of election and installation. The Senior Warden knows that he probably will be elected Master and by far the greatest part of his planning must be done before he is installed as Master. With respect to officer appointments, remember that when a Steward is appointed to the line, a man is being appointed who stands a good chance of being elected Master some day. It may be better to appoint a Past Master to an office until more qualified men become available to avoid junior officers \"jumping\" stations. The training attained in each chair is an invaluable part of the experience needed to become a good Master. The progressive lodge doesn't have this condition. However, should this be a problem at any time, the surest way to build for the future is to strive toward making the best officer selections possible? Do not settle for second best. 6. Degree Work . Although a Degree Work Committee may have been appoi nted, it is the duty of the Master to see to it that the work, as well as the meetings, is conducted w ith the dignity consistent with the tenets of Masonry. 7. Committee Appointments . The Master, is to make all Committee appointments, and can consult on this matter if desired with the Wardens or whomever he chooses. Again, as in the case of appointing officers, much of this effort should have been expended before being installed Master. A separate section of this guide has been established for committees and committee appointments. (See Lodge Organization and Administration) Committee chairmen, particularly the Prog ram Committee Chairman, should be select ed far enough in advance so that he can begin thinking unofficially a bout programming for the coming year. The number and nature of committees will vary, of course, with each lodge. Much can be done to stimulate interest in lodge activity by the effective use of efficient committees. An efficient committee consists of several people, all of whom participate in the work of the committee not just the chairman alone. We all know the undeniable truth that the more people we put to work in the Lodge and encourage to complete assignments, the more interest, activity, \"and attendance we generate. The Senior Warden is encouraged to as k the incumbent Master for advice in this respect and assign to the Master an important committee responsibility for next year. When he retires as Master, he will have had some valuable experience let's capitalize on it. Don't let him retire from active duty. 8. Masonic Funerals and/or Memorial Services . Upon receiving notice of the passing of a Brother, arrange for an immediate visitation with the family and offer any assistance, which might seem indicated. Also arrange, when requested, for a Masonic Funeral or Memo rial Service. Bear in mind that the family of the deceas ed may be totally unfamiliar with such proceedings, and some helpful suggestions on your part may be greatly \"appreciated. One of the greatest impressions made on the non-Masonic public is our Masonic Funeral Service. One of your duties as Worshipful Master in this important area is to insure that no effort is spared in consoling the departed Brother's family. This requires that a prompt, personal visitation be made to the widow or survivor. Explain the departed Brother's right to a Masonic Service, and be ready to coordinate the arrangements if the widow so desires. Insure that the Service is conducted in a manner that truly honors the departed Brother's memory, and gives solace to those he left behind. There is no requirement that the Master specifically conduct th is service, the greater duty lies in seeing that it is properly done. Do not hesitate to assign this to the most proficient Brother available. . The Wisconsin Monitor should he consulted for regulations relating to funeral services in the Monitor or the service prepared by the Grand Lodge Committee on Masonic Education should be used rather than some version or modified form there of. Above all, make doubly sure that those conducting the service have the ceremonies well learned and perform them in an efficient, dignified, and impressive manner to bring out the true meaning. \"This service is meant to be a comfort to the bereaved, to make a favorable impression on others present, and must be conducted with these goals in mind Every effort must be made to have harmony with the Minister and his church. The involvement of the Lodge in a Memorial Service or the actual Committal, can lead to misund erstanding with some Clergy, particularly when they are not members of the Craft. Be sure to verify if Clergy is to be involved, and coordinate the Lodge's activity in a manner that leaves a lasting respect in the Clergyman's mind, rather than building animosity towards the Craft. Remember that the purpose of the Service is to supplement the Brother's personal religion, and not upstage it. 9. Appoint Investigating Committee . Instruct the Secretary to inform the Master of all petitions received by him prior to the stated communication, so it can determine if they are in order for presentation in the lodge, and to enable some thought to be given to the selection of an Investigating Committee. This is a prospectiv e candidate's introduction to Masonry and the experience should be a pl easant and favorable one. See to it th at the members of the committee are well acquainted with their responsibilities. It cannot be too often stated, \"that the first impression made on a man proves to be the lasting one.\" Often we forget this when it comes to new candidates. One of your least r ecognized but most important responsibilities as Worshipful Master's is the assignment of investigating commi ttees. Review the interview procedure yourself, and insist that the Brethren you assign to this task are fully familiar with it so that they may discharge their"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 responsibilities in a manner that brings pride to themselves and honor to your Lodge. Discuss the philosophy presented by the Lodge Councilor program with them so they can understand just how important the early impressions formed by the candidate are to you and your Lodge. The manner in whic h you guard the West Gate, as well as the manner in which you answer those alarms will determin e, to a great extent, your contribu tion to your Lodge's long-term success. A letter used by a Wisconsin Lodge can help that positive 1st impression. \"To Applicant For Membership: As the nature of the institution of Freemasonry is unknown to you, it is deemed advisable, that before presenting a formal petition with your signature, you should be informed on certain features and phases of the institution, which may affect your decision for seeking membership therein. Freemasonry has in all ages required that men should come to its door entirely of their own free will and accord, and of mature age: not as the result of importunity nor from idle curiosity, but from a favorable opinion, a desire for knowledge, and a' sincere wish to be serviceable to their fellow creatures. Freemasonry is a system of morality, based on the belief in the existence of God, the Brotherhood of Man and the Immortality of the Soul; therefore, no atheist can be made a Mason. It strives to teach a man the duty he owes to God, his country, his family, his neighbor and himself. It interferes with neither religion nor politics, but strives only after Light and truth, endeavoring always to bring out the highest and noblest qualities of men. It should be clearly borne in mind that Freemasonry is not to be entered in the hope of material gain or advancement. Admission must not be sought for mercenary or selfish motives. Anyone so actuated will be disappointed. The aim of the true Freemason is to cultivate a brotherly feeling among men, and to help the distressed and afflicted to the extent of his ability. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that Freemasonry is not a benefit society. The practice of charity is a fundamental virtue taught in Freemasonry. It is obvious, however, that the member ship must carry the burden of the cost of lodge operations and functions, and an applicant therefore should feel free to meet his obligations for degree fees and annual dues, without material handicap or detriment to his family or dependents. Such annual dues do not entitle us to draw such pay Dr death benefits. Loyalty to one's country is an essen tial qualification in Freemasonry, and t hose only are acceptable who cheerfully conform to every lawful authority. Disloyalty in any fo rm is abhorrent to the teachings of Freemasonry, and is regarded as a serious Masonic offense. The Fraternity expects your sin cere attachment. It also requires that you will actively and constantly work for its best interests, and to this end, we will require part of your tim e and abilities. We ask that you consider that it will be your duty to attend our meetings, and contribute your share to any of our useful undertakings. Upon your admission to Freemasonry, you must obligate yourself to absolute secrecy. Whoever possesses self-respect cannot become a traitor to our Fraternity. He who violates his obligation becomes a traitor only to himself. If after serious consideration to the fore going you feel sincerely disposed to seek to enter our portals, you may register your intentions by a formal petition, blan k form for which is herewith presented. 10. Appoint Lodge Counselor . One of the finest tools for candidate instruction and education is that supplied by the Counselor material obtainable from the Grand Secretary. Every Master and, fo r that matter, every Officer should be vitally interested in the adopting of the Counselor System of candidate instruction; and it is the duty of the Master to appoint the Lodge Counselor who, in turn, appoints the Candidate Counselors. 11. Housekeeping. Because of the impression it imparts to members and visitors alike, the Master should be constantly aware of the housekeeping practices in the Temple and should see to it that it is always neat and clean, inside and outside.   ,   12. Officers Meetings . The Master must insist that he and his officers meet regularly to discuss the emergent problems of the lodge, to divide the work assignments, and through group discussion, give frank and honest opinions how they can best help each other, that the Master ma y have pleasure and the Craft profit thereb y. These meetings cannot be haphazard affairs, they must be planned. The Master should prepare an agenda of topics to be discussed and distribute it to all those he expects to attend. If the chairmen of the various Lodge committees are present, it provides an excellent opportunity for the junior offices to study at first hand the inner workings of the fraternity. The officers of the Lodge must plan to maintain continuity from one admini stration to the next. Succeeding Masters must not destroy that which their predecessors have built. Establish a con tinuing program of events that have proved successful, innovating only to maintain interest or excitement. Give all new ideas a fair but cautious trial. Gradual changes are more easily inculcated than radical. When you call an officers' meeting, open promptly, conduct your business efficiently and close early then have your refreshments. In this way any officer wh o needs to get away early may do so. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 13. Committee Reports . Periodic committee reports should be required. Nothing will spur a committee to action as much as knowledge that a report will be expect ed on the lodge floor at a specific time. In addition to the duties and responsibilities discussed above are those, of course, which are imposed by Grand Lodge Code and by the By-Laws of each Lodge. In discharging all of the Master's Masonic duties, the performance he achieves is very much dependent upon the guidelines and leadership he establishes to justify in his own life and work the title of \"Worshipful Master\" which he now bears and his worthiness of the honor which his brethren have conferred upon him. 14. Building Operation. If your Lodge owns its own building, you will have several responsibilities that your counterpart in a \"ren ting Lodge\" will not be f aced with. Initially, you should review your insurance cove rage and insure that it provides ample protection to your Lodge. (See Chapter 93.01 or the Code regarding Public Liabilities Insurance). A local insurance agent will be glad to sit down with you to review the program, and the Grand Lodge's carrier will also be very cooperative in assisting you to obtain adequate coverage. (For other informa tion call the Grand Secretary). Dependent on your Lodge's procedure, you should also review with your Trustees or House Committee the general operation procedures of your Lodge. Be particularly familiar with the rules governing use of the building by the various groups on dates other than their regularly scheduled meetings. The small investment in a calendar to schedule the use of the building by all of the groups will provide a valuable tool alongside your telephone. II Wardens It is a commonly accepted tradition that the Senior Warden is in charge of the Craft during hours of labor and the Junior Warden during those of refreshment. This rule may be followed, but this is not necessarily a practice to blindly follow because the Master may give orde rs to either Warden at any time. In the absence of the Master, of course, the Senior Ward en becomes the Presiding Officer and in many respects he represents the Master in the government of the Lodge. In th e absence of both the Master and Senior Warden, the Junior Warden will preside. It is imperative, th erefore, that the Wardens prepare themse lves for this possibility as well as the preparation needed to assume the Mast er's chair in his own right one day, Other than the duties assigned by the Master, the most impelling duty is one of planning. It is necessary to become thoroughly familiar with the Master's duties an d the requirements of lodge administration. III Other Officers Most of the specific assignments to ot her officers will be in the form of co mmittee appointments by the Master based on an officer's specific qualifi cations and many of the duties will vary from lodge to lodge as they apply to the related officers. In this light, it is expected that all officers will serve willingly and conscientiously on all committees to which appointed. Assist the Master and Degree Work Committee in the dignified conduct of the meetings and degree work. Be very conscientious in promoting and assisting in the operation of the Counselor System. Review as often as necessary the char ges given at the time of installation. IV Treasurer and Secretary The basic duties of these officers are well \"charged\" to them at Installation. These offi cers leave upon the Lodge the imprints of their efforts. Masters usually are elected for one-year terms yet the Tr easurer and Secretary may be re-elected many times. Because they execute almost all of the Lodges financial transactions, record keeping, and correspondence, and thus represent the Worshipful Master and the membership , they create a fixed impressi on not only within the Lodge, but also upon the world outside. A Master Mason signs the By-Laws at the Secretary's desk , and from that time on he has more contact with the Secretary than with any other officer and much of the Brother's enthusiasm for Masonry may be dependent upon the nature of this contact. The effect of the Treasurer's and Secretary's association with the officers and Brethren in the interest of helpfulness and co-operation will do much to make each administration efficien t and harmonious. Frequent reports to the Lodge will be helpful and informative to the officers and Brethren. V Chaplain A demonstrated reverence for the tenets of Masonry is the towering characteristic of the Chaplain. As he walks among men and in his association with them, he should exemplify t hose characteristics, which we hold most dear and in the highest esteem. It's more the manner of the Chaplain's life among his brethren than his oratory that must count for the successful conduct of his office."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 VI Deacons In the active duties of conducting the business of a Lodge, the Senior Deacon is th e messenger for th e Master while the Junior Deacon is the messenger for the Senior Warden. Here again, observing and planning is an attri bute to be developed and exercised by the Deacons. Generally, these are training offices and all effort should be expended to take advantage of this opportunity by attending and participating in officers meetings, receiving counsel, and making suggestions with respect to Lodge administration. Specifically, (a.) The Senior Deacon is u ltimately responsible for the proper preparation of the candidate who comes to him from the hands of the Stewards, and he must absolutely assure himself that the candidate is \"duly and truly prepared,\" He should so conduct his candidate through the degrees that that candidate will forever after be his friend because of that association. (b.) The Junior Deacon assumes the responsibility for the physi cal and mental preparation of the candidate. He is associated with the candidate at a time when apprehension and some doubt may be prevalent, and his attitude and actions can do much to allay any existing doubts or fears and make this a most inspirational and exhilarating experience for the candidate. VII Stewards The Stewards, with the Junior Deacon, are responsible for th e physical preparation of the candidate. During this most impressionable phase of a conferral, joki ng with the candidate about his initiation, passing, or raising cannot be tolerated. Each candidate should receive the impres sion that his experience that evening is to be a serious event, conducted with decorum and dignity. There should be no horse play or levity in connection with the ritual. Instead, all should strive to impress upon the candidate's mind the importance of the ceremonies in which he participates. VIII Tiler Special attention shou ld be paid to strangers visiting the Lodge, because much of the pleasure of the visit must begin in his room. It is his duty to know the business of every person who may remain in the anteroom. He represents the Master at the outer door of the Lodge receiving messages and names of brethren desiring to enter. Consequently, he should be civil and courteous. All who approach him Masonically should be treated with respect and all proper questions should be answered courteously. Masonic Law It is essential that all officers of Symbolic Lodges posse ss a well-grounded knowledge of Masonic Law as well as being well informed about the customs and usages of the craft. This knowledge can best be obtained by a familiarization with: The Ancient Land Marks The Ancient Landmarks of Freemasonry are the supreme Masonic Law, and are immutable, irrepealable and unalterable. They are the ancient unwritten Masonic laws , existing from time immemorial. which differentiate and distinguish the Masonic Fraternity from all other organizations. The Grand Lodge, being a sovereign body, may interpret the terms and conditions of the Ancient Landmarks. The Landmarks, or the Unwritte n Law By Albert G. Mackey Sir William Blackstone commences his Commentaries on the Laws of England with the succinct definition, that \"law, in its most general and comprehensive sense, signifies a rule of action, and is applied to all kinds of action, whether animate or inanimate, rational or irrational.\" It is in this sens e that we speak of the laws of a country as being those rules, whether derived from positive enactment of the legislative authority, or from long-established custom, by which the conduct of its citizens or subjects is regulated. So, too, societies, which are but empires, kingdoms, or republics in miniature, are also controlled by rules of action, which are, to their respective members, as perfect laws as th e statutes of the realm. And hence Freemasonry, as the most ancient and universal of all societies, is governed by its laws or rules of action, which either spring out of its organization, and are based upon its long established customs and usages, or which are derived from the enactment of its superintending tribunals. This difference in the origin of the Laws of Masonr y leads to a threefold division of them, as follows: 1. Landmarks  2. General Regulations 3. Local Regulations The writers on municipal law have made a division of a ll laws into unwritten and written the \"leges nonscriptae\" and \"'leges scriptae” Applying these terms to th e threefold division of Maso nic Law, we should say th at the unwritten laws or customs of Masonry constitute its Landmarks, and that the written law is to he obtained in the regulations made by the supreme Masonic authority, and wh ich are either general or local, as the auth ority which enacted them was either general"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 or local in its character. The Ancient Landmarks have been controversially debated since the beginning of organized Masonry and no full agreement has yet been reached on just how many Landmark s there are and which ones are the basis of our unwritten laws. Nevertheless, the Landmarks are univ ersally recognized as the fundamental laws of the fraternity and they are generally held to be universally unalterable and unrepealable. They have been so intimately woven into the fabric of Masonry that no one may detract from them or do anything else but to live by and obey them. Some Grand Jurisdictions have adopted Mackey's twenty -five Landmarks, others more and others less. We in Wisconsin have never officially adopted any of the Landmarks but we do say in our Constitution, the Grand Lodge is the supreme Masonic authority in the State of Wisc onsin subject only to the Ancient Landmarks. In recent years students of Masonic ju risprudence have given considerable weight to the Ancient Landmarks as defined by Most Worshi pful Roscoe Pound, Past Gra nd Master of the Grand Lodge Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Massachusetts and Dean Em eritus of Harvard Law School. 2. Constitution of the Grand Lodge The first Constitution was prepared and adopted for the Gra nd Lodge of Wisconsin on 18 December 1843. A record of the history and changes to that original constitution is cont ained in the Preface to the Ma sonic Code of Wisconsin. The Constitution in its current form is contained in Articles 1- 20 of the Masonic Code. The Constitution of the Grand Lodge is subordinate only to the Ancient Landmarks. 3. Ancient Common Law The Ancient Common Law of Fr ee Masonry is the Ancient usages, charge s and Regulations of Free Masonry, differing only from the Ancient Land Marks in that the Ancient Common Law may be altered and amended by the Grand Lodge in those rare instances when the welfare of the Craft shall require the proposed change. 4. Statutes - The Masonic Code of Wisconsin The Masonic Code and its annual supplement. The Grand Lodge has furnished each Lodge with two copies of the code, one to be used by the incumbent Master for reference and one to be retained by the Secretary. In addition, each year one copy of the code supplement is mailed to each Lodge for the purpose of updating the Code. Sh ould one or both copies of the Code be misplaced or lost, additiona l copies can be purchased from the Gran d Lodge Office. An officer of a Lodge cannot possibly expect to eff ectively discharge his duty to the Lodge as Master without a good working knowledge of the code. 5. Edicts An edict is; (1) a judicial and not a legislative action of th e Grand Lodge; (2) an approved decision of a Grand Master, but such decision shall apply only to the instant case and shall not become a part of the statutes. It is helpful in future understanding of the point raised, and may overrule a previous edict. (See part II of the Code for a summary of Edicts) 6. Decisions A decision is a determination or order of decree of a Grand Master, prior to its presentation to the Grand Lodge. A decision of a Grand Master is valid and controlling unless an d until disapproved by the Grand Lodge. (See Part II of the Code for a summary of Decisions} 7. The By-Laws of the rel ated constituent Lodge. It is impetrative' that the officers of the Lodge assume the responsibility of becoming familiar with and maintaining the By-Laws in current order to legally conduct the affairs of the Lodge. A copy of the By-Laws should also be given to each newly raised Master Mason. When installed an incoming Mast er agrees to \"rule & govern\" his lodge consistent with its by-laws. Chapter 61 of the Code deals with Lodge By-Laws. These should be among the first things a new Master becomes familiar with. 8. The Annual Proceedings of the Grand Lodge. After each annual Communication of the Grand Lodge in June, two official printed copies of the proceedings are mailed to each Lodge. A review of the ma jor subjects covered by th e proceedings of the previous Communication should be a topic for discussion in open lodge. These proceedings are an invaluable source of information regarding Masonry in Wisconsin and should be reviewed as soon as possible to familiarize the new Master with the types of information it provides. It will save you many hours later and keep you informed on the latest status of Masonry in Wisconsin. 9. Relationship to Laws of the State of Wisconsin The Grand Lodge of Wisconsin as are all its constituent Symbo lic Lodges is subject to conformity to the Laws of the State of Wisconsin, A summary of these is provided on pages 145 thru 149 of the Code. 10. Responsibility for Compliance with Masonic Law Every Mason is charged with compliance with his countries, state etc. laws as well as Masonic Law. As in the government of all such bodies certain officials are given responsibilities for such compliance and for changes to the same. Chapter 21 of the Masonic Code is repeated in its entirety for explanation of this area of Masonic Law. Chapter 21 Laws 21.01 Expounding the Law. The law of this Grand Jurisdiction shall be expounded by the Grand Lodge, the Grand"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 Master or the Worshipful Master of a lodge, in the order named 21.02 Repeal of Laws. All laws, regulations and edicts in conflict with any provisio ns of this code are hereby repealed. 21.03 Amendment of Masonic Code. The Ancient Common Law and Statutes of the Grand Lodge may be amended at an annual communication of the Grand Lodge, in the same manner and by the same vote as the Constitution may be amended. An Edict may be affirmed, modified or repealed at an annual communication of the Grand Lodge by a majority vote of those present. A decision of the Grand Master shall be approved or disapproved by the Grand Lodge at its next annual communication, by a majority vote of those present. 11. Changes to the Masonic Code (Statutes) Any chartered Lodge of the Grand Jurisdiction of Wisconsi n may offer a resolution at the Annual Communication to amend the Code with the only stipulation being that it be sent to the Grand Secretary at l east sixty days prior to the annual communication. Chapter 38 of the Code defines the rules for submittal of such resolutions. Each year, not later than 45 days prior to the Grand Lo dge Communication, the Grand S ecretary mails to each Lodge Secretary a complete list of all unfinished business from the last year and a list of proposed resolutions for the forth coming Annual Communication per Chapter 25 (25.07) of the Code. Each Master should be aware of such resolutions, although the members of the Grand Lodge (Symbolic Lodge Masters and Wardens) are not required to consult their Lodge membership for a position on each such resolution (they should vote for the good of the Craft). It is wise and prudent for the membership to be aware of proposed changes in Masonic Law, which they will be expected to cheerfully conform to. The Grand Lodge of Wisconsin The Laws governing the Grand Lodge are contained in Chapters 21-50 of the Masonic Code. Membership of the Grand Lodge. Representatives and Delegates to Grand Lodge Communications are defined in Articles 4 and 5 of the Constitution, which are provided below. The officers, their title s and rank are defined in Article 6 also provided below. Officers 6.01 Titles and Rank. The officers of the Grand Lodge, their titles and rank shall be as follows: 1. Most Worshipful Grand Master. 2. Right Worshipful Deputy Grand Master. 3. Right Worshipful Senior Grand Warden. 4. Right Worshipful Junior Grand Warden. 5. Right Worshipful Grand Treasurer. 6. Right Worshipful Grand Secretary. 7. Worshipful Grand Chaplain. 8. Worshipful Grand Lecturer . . 9. Worshipful Seni or Grand Deacon. 10. Worshipful Juni or Grand Deacon. 11. Worshipful Grand Stewards. 12. Worshipful Grand Marshal. 13. Worshipful Grand Tiler. 6.02 Grand Trustees. There shall be three Grand Trustees, one to be elected at each an nual communication for a three-year term, and one for each unexpi red term of a previously elected trus tee whose office became vacant during the preceding year. 6.03 Qualifications. All Grand Lodge Officers and Grand Trustees sha ll be residents of the State of Wisconsin, and each shall be a member of a lodge therein. All Grand Lodg e Officers, except the Grand S ecretary, the Grand Chaplain, the Grand Marshal and the Grand Tile r shall be actual Past Masters. 6.04 When and How Selected . At each annual communication of this Grand Lodge there shall be selected by ballot a Grand Master. Deputy Grand Master, Senior Grand Warden , Junior Grand Warden, Grand Treasurer, Grand Secretary and at least one Grand Trustee. All other officers shall be appointed by the newly el ected Grand Master at such communication. Membership 4.01 Members. The members of the Grand Lodge shall be its Gran d Officers, Grand Trustees, Past Grand Masters. Past Deputy Grand Masters, Past Gran d Wardens. Past Grand Treasurers and Pa st Grand Secretaries, who are members of lodges under its jurisdiction. none of whom may be represented by proxy, and also the Masters and Wardens of all its chartered lodges or their proxies. Further details should be obtained from the Masonic Code. Each Master. Senior and Junior Warden is a member of the Grand Lodge and it is a duty incumbent upon them to attend the Annual Communication of the Grand Lodge each June. It is here and only here that all legislation governing"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 the Grand Lodge is adopted as well as the regulations for constituent Lodges. Masters and Wardens are a part of this legislative body and it is strictly through their combined effo rts that laws are enacted for the government of the Grand Lodge and each constituent lodge. (Section 1, Article VI, constitution of the Grand Lodge) Grand Lodge Office Although the members of the Grand Lodge and its officers are located in the Symbolic Lodges throughout the State of Wisconsin the official location of the Grand Lodge is 36275 Sunset Drive, Dousman, WI 53118. The telephone number is 1-800-242-2307. The Grand Master has an office in the Grand Lodge Building. The Grand Secretary operates from this buildi ng. The Grand Secretary's office and sta ff provide a number of services to the symbolic Lodges ranging from a source of reading material to distribution of changes to the Code. The Area Administrator/District Deputy system in Wisconsin is a function of the Grand Lodge of Wisconsin. In the event you cannot get an answer from the Area Administrator/District Deputy for your Lodge for some need, the Grand Secretary's office is another source of help. Remember that the Area Administrator, District Deputy an d Grand Secretary's activities are performed by brethren who want only to serve. Don't hesitate to contact them on a problem: there's a good chance they've already faced it and can offer several solutions for your use. Few Masters have enjoyed a year without the need for counseling and their brethren offer the best source for such help, Lodge Organization and Administration Introduction Review the responsibilities currently assigned to each officer , committee and member of your Lodge. Do they include all the functions and activities in which your Lodge should be active? Are there areas of re sponsibility, which overlap? Or are not assigned? Do thes e conform to your by-laws? Successful active Lodges assure continuity of their activities by careful organiza tion and definition of such functions to prevent their loss or decay with a change in Lodge administration. As Master, you will be the Chief Administrative officer, the leader, and you are therefore responsible for all of the Lodges activities within and without the Lodge Room. An eff ective leader realizes that he cannot and should not do everything himself, that the work must be shared by all. In building Solomon's Temple, he \"classified and arranged the workmen so that neither envy, discord or confusion, was suffered to inte rrupt the peace and tran quility. \" Such is your task in planning to be an effective Ma ster. Careful selection and assignment of qua lified brethren to each task should be your constant thought when planning for your term in the East. This will provide the time for you to oversee these Lodge functions while giving as many members as possible a role in the Lodges activities. Committee Assignments Without conflicting with the present Master you can select your people long before your election. The people you choose should have an enthusiasm for Masonry and for the program they direct. They should have a knowledge and special talent in the area of their assignment and not. be discouraged if their initial progress is disappointing. They must have time to devote to the committee or be willing to forego some other activity that they might get the time. They must agree to work amicably with anyone whom the Master may appo int. They must also have a deep sense of responsibility. No appointment should be made without asking the Brother individually and sp ecifically if he is willing to accept the appointment and to work diligently and tirelessly at the task assigned. This must be done before the committee appointments are announced. Perhaps more committees are discussed in the followi ng paragraphs than may be used by most lodges; however, it is an acknowledged fact that the more of ou r brothers we put to work, the better will be our chances of enjoying the benefits of a lodge which is a live, moving, and growing in numbers and stature. Whatever Committees are appointed plan them well in advance and be sure that the Committee Chairmen understand that each committee is expected to disc harge its responsibilities. No one can afford committees in name only - see to it that they work, and one of th e best stimuli in accomplishing this is to ma ke known that committee reports will be called for at specific times. Some general rules for the operatio n of a successful committee are: 1. Have active members 2. Follow a planned agenda. 3. Start on time, work your plan and adjourn early 4. Give advance notice of each meeting in writing; then call and remind each member a day or two in advance 5. Keep a written record of important items of each meeting Remember a successful year will depend up on and reflect upon good committees. Program Committee This committee, of course, gets at the core of most of our problems and probabl y has more to do with successful lodge"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 activity than any other. The Senior Warden might well be the Chairman of this committee. It is of such importance that a separate section of this guide is devoted exclusively to this subject (See Lodge Programming). Duties include but are not limited to: a. Planning specific programs in advan ce of the lodge year. Probab ly in two groups - first half of the year and second half of the year. Degree work, because the timing and amount is usually uncertain, can be worked in as specials if necessary, not interfering with any planned programs. b. Consulting with next year's Master for a ny preferences or suggestions he might have. c. Considering assigning each program to a separate brother or group of br others for developi ng and arranging. d. Making sure that the Attendance and Publicity Commi ttees are kept well informed of your plans so that proper information can be given the membership. e. Arranging meetings involving a dinner or potluck or buffet as they are usually well received - remember, one way to a Mason's Lodge attendance, like a man's heart, is very frequently through his stomach. f. Encouraging intra-lodge visitations on' those evenings when an especial1y good program is being planned. Masters' Committee This committee’s primary function is to assist the Master in the administrative work involved in candidate interviews, to hear reports from such interviews, to interview the candida te themselves and in general to \"guard the West Gate.\" It usually has a membership of from 9 to 15 members. (A good committee for using the experience of Past Masters). Some Lodges set up subcommittees of the Masters Committee to serve the functions of the Membership and Attendance Committees as well as Fune ral Service and Obituary Committee. Attendance Committee The Chairman of this committee could very likely be the Se nior Deacon and should consist of enough members so as to efficiently discharge the following duties, which should be: Use this committee as a calling committee for local members. E ach local member should be called at least four times during the year, more often for smaller lodges. When calling, offer transportation. A brother is more likely to attend a meeting if someone offers to pick him up. Keep track of and maintain statistics relative to the effec tiveness of this committee. Possibly select teams within the committee who will compete with each other in securing better attendance. This committee could also be used to call the membership advising of funeral or memorial services. Specifically be sure that brethren are ca lled to attend lodge on the anniversaries of their raising and also on birthdays. Send birthday greeting on behalf of the lodge. Membership Committee The most valuable resource of every lo dge is its membership. A Master who knows his membership and puts it to work for the best interest of the Lodge is bound to have a successful program. To aid a would-be Master in planning his program, it will be worth the effort to assemble a card file on every member. Do not do this, however, unless your officers agree to keep the card file up-to-date and to use it. A Membership Committee, if established, should have as part of its charge, the assembling and up-dating of a card file on the membership. This card file should contain a wide variety of information including current addresses and telephone numbers. For the purpose of assembling such a file it is suggested that every member receive a personal visitation by at least one member of the Membership Committee. Do not mail out a questionnaire - take it to the home and fill it out while talking to the brother and his family. One possible form, which such a questionnaire might take, is provided for your review.

One Lodge uses this data to compile statistics regarding its membership for use by other committees, the Master, Secretary and Treasurer. They study their membership for 1) Age distribution 2) Member interests 3) Home location related to other members. One Lodge uses a large map with numbered stickpins for each member. They are colored red for ages 21-35, orange 36.50, yellow 51-65 and blue 66+. A quick glance at the map and if transportation is needed a younger member close by can be easily located. If the Master need s interviews for a candidate, members w ho live close by are easily identified. The Funeral Committee and Telephone Commi ttees can easily organize from this type of information. The Program Committee can find several brothers who with like interests might put on a program together. The use of this type information goes on and on. Funeral Service and Obituary Committee Ussual1y consists of the Secretary and at least one Past Master whose duty it is to prepare the obituaries within the wishes of the family and to set up a method within the lodg e to notify all of the brethren of the time and place of a Masonic service. Education Committee \"The basic function of a Masonic Lodge is to make Master Masons. This does not mean the formality of raising candidates - It exte nds far beyond that period in the life of Mason. The task of making Master Masons must be directed toward all of us, those who are Master Masons and those who are in the process of becoming Master Masons. At no time in Masonic hi story has there been a greater need for an understanding of what Freemasonry is and what it stands for than there is today.\" Much has been left undone in the education of the Members of our Lodges. The program of Masonic Education, put into effect by the symbolic Lodges, is intended to meet this immediate and never-ending need. \"The fruits of our efforts to teach and to learn about Freemasonry, the interest that we show the candidates as we welcome them in to the new World of Freemasonry, and the knowledge and enthusiasm which we give to our members will be evident in the years to come. We will r eap in exact proportion to the amount we sow.\" Because this is an area of such importa nce, a separate section of this guide has been devoted exclusively to Masonic Education. (See A Lodge System of Education). Study Club Committee This is a committee or group which is not used often eno ugh in our constituent lodges and its possible effectiveness applies not only to large lodges but to the smaller ones as well. The chairman should be one of the more knowledgeable Master Masons involving Masonic history, tradition, r itual, protocol, Grand Lodge organization. and lodge administration. Some of the sp ecific duties should include: a. To personally invite each newly made Master Mason to attend Study Club meetings. b. To be alert for any outstanding leadership and fo ster activity and participation. Keep such indicated leadership interested and active. c. Encourage all officers to attend Study Club meetings and assign to them specifi c subjects to research and prepare discussions. d. Use this group to assist in recognizing potential material for participating on a degree team. Refreshment Committee The inner man needs proper attention and it is the purpose of this committee to satisfy this need. The Junior Warden is a logical chairman and some of th e duties of this committee are: a. To see that the tables are properly furnished with refreshments as di rected by the Master. b. To assume responsibility for pla nning and arranging the food portion of all dinners and banquets. c. Take charge of dinner ticket selling and reporting of reservations. Close' co-ordination is required with the Program, Attendance, and Publicity Committee. Visitation Committee The Chairman of this committee as well as several of the members could very well be retired brothers. Their responsibilities could include: a. Visit the sick brethren and keep in touch with respect to their needs and condition. b. Report to the lodge and make recomme ndations with respect to the needs of a brother who is ill or in distress. Use the lodge bulletin board for posting notices relative to those who are ill."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 Degree Work Committee This committee has no single chairman bu t probably three co-chairmen - one fo r each of the symbolic degrees. These could be the Master for MM. degree, the Senior Warden for the F.C. degree, and the .Junior Warden for the E.A. degree. The co-chairmen could also effectively be three Past Masters. Be sure you have available for use the new 3 letter cipher as the ritualistic work is set forth in very understandable form. The responsibilities of each of the degree captains for the degrees a. Secure and develop the degree team with satisfactor y alternates in key positions. Use Brothers who are not officers whenever possible. Put as many men to work as possible. b. Arrange for sufficient rehearsals so that the work may be impressively exemplified. Call upon Proficiency Men from within the Lodge or adjoinin g lodges for assistance if needed. c. Urge members of the team to attend Schools of Instruction with the officers. d. Keep moving the work around give the newly made Master Mason a chance to work in a degree. e. See that the charges are committed to memory as part of the work wherever possible. f. The Senior Deacon should be a member of this co mmittee and be charged with the responsibility of the proper preparation of the candidate. Others may do the preparing but he should be responsible for it and see that it is properly done. g. As a member of this committee, the Senior Warden should arrange for outstanding degree teams in other lodges to visit his lodge and confer degrees occasionally. Be sure that th e Attendance Committee is informed of such visitations as well in advance so that extra effort can be expended in promoting attendance. h. Once again, all members of the l odge should be encouraged to work on a degree team. This committee should be concerned with the proficiency of the work as well as with providing ample opportunity to each member to work if he is capable and so desires. Counseling and Posting Committee This committee is extremely important. Their work is most vital to the health of each lodge. The material with which this committee works provides the lodge with the leadersh ip of tomorrow and it must be guided, encouraged, aI1d educated effectively. The members of th is committee are called Candidate Counselors or Posters. To be practical in our organizational efforts, the Counselor and the Poster can and probably should be one and the same brother. The Chairman of this committee could be the brother appointed by the Master as Lodge Counselor. The duties of the Lodge Counselor and this committee are: a. Complete familiarization of the Counselor program and its materials. b. Select and arrange for posters to be proficient in the posting lectures. c. The chairman should have personal knowledge of a brother's proficiency before he is examined in any degree. d. Part of the educational process of a candidate after he has become a Master Mason is to instruct him in the organizational structure and operation of the Lodge, including the by-laws, balloting, motion procedures, etc. Don't let the new Master Mason flounder and become discouraged because no one has told him what to expect in a lodge meeting. e. Contact the brethren whose progress in degree work ha s been delayed and report their reasons to the Master. Publicity Committee Usually consists of a Steward and one or two highly qualified brethren with knowledge of the communications field. A wide-awake Publicity Committee will play an extremely im portant part in maintaining the vitality of the Lodge. Some of its duties could be: a. To see that proper notice of all meetings is given to members of the lodge with special emphasis on special meetings. This requires a co-ordinatio n of effort with all officers and comm ittee chairs with the Master to use the trestle board effectively. b. It could be most beneficial to develop and publish a monthly bulletin discussing recent activities as well as those planned for the future. c. Arrange for newspaper publicity regarding interesting events including pictures wherever possible. Advance publicity will receive more attention than post publicity. Also arrange to send this information along with photographs to the Editor for possible use in the Wisconsin Masonic Journal, 1123 N. Astor St., Milw, WI 53202. Everyone likes to see his name and picture in print. Furniture Committee The Tiler of the lodge is the logical chairman of this committee. The duties should include: a. To see that the jewels, regalia, and furniture of the lodge are in proper order for each meeting. b. To keep the necessary equipment used in the preparat ion of candidates clean and in good order at all times. c. To see that all aprons are kept cleaned and pressed. d. To make sure that all equipment is put away in its proper place at the close of each meeting. e. To see that all brethren are properly clothed at stated, special, and funeral communications."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 f. Work with the degree captains in providing, setting up , and returning to its proper place all of the properties needed for the conferring of degrees. Greeting Committee This committee might best consist of the Master and Ward ens, especially the Master, arriving at the lodge well in advance of the appointed time for the meeting and greeting each and every brother as he enters the temple. This is not only creating a friendly atmosphere but a welcome such as this makes each brother feel that the officers of the lodge are personally interested in his attendance. This is also a good opportunity to welcome a visitor and make him feel comfortable and at home. Finance Committee The Wisconsin Masonic Code Chapter 62.04 provides that each lodge shall have a Finance Committee consisting of the Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. The basic responsibilities of this Committee are to: a. Examine and approve all bills, claims, and accounts brought before the lodge. b. Periodically examine the books and vouchers of the Treasurer and Secretary and report to the lodge. c. Annually present an income and expense budget to the lodge for adoption. Account should be taken of the need for special and separate accounts such as Charity, Building, etc. as well as reserve or depreciation ac- counts. Periodic reviews should be made of the budget progress with reports made to the lodge. d. Take particular care to periodically review all dues accounts to determine delinquencies and arrange to take the necessary action to prevent perpetuating the problem by PERSONALLY calling on local delinquents, and try every means possible to avoid suspension. Perhaps a payment plan can be arranged. A study should be made, at least annually, of the possible need for adjusting income accounts such as fees and dues with the recommendation to adjust as indicated. Conducting the Business of the Lodge. A well-run communication begins at the door. Every member of your Lodge who attends a meeting, whether he participates or just listens, should feel happy, comfortable an d, most of all, wanted in Lodge- Every visitor should be made welcome in the same manner. A Master should greet each member and visitor before Lodge opens, introduce the visitor to the brethren present and determine if the visitor can be vouched for and if not, see to it that an examining committee is assigned promptly. The committee should be well versed, polite, considerate and keep the examination as brief as possible. A brother made welcome and comfortable will return again to help fill those empty chairs and will carry away the true spirit of brotherly love and affection. A. Opening. All stated communications must be opened on the M.M. degree. If, after the business has been conducted work is to be done in another degree, labor is dispensed with in the M.M. degree and a lodge of E.A. or F.C. opened. After the work has been performed, the lodge of E.A. or F.C. is closed and labor resumed in the M.M. degree. If no more business is to be transacted the lodge is then clos ed in the M.M. degree IN PRESCRIBED FORM. Only a Grand Lodge Officer is permitted to close in short form upon request of the Worshipful Master. All business of a Lodge must be conducted on the M.M. degree. A special communication for work may be opened and closed in the degree in whic h the work is to be performed. The Official Cipher describes the short form procedure used in changing from one degree to another. B. Order of Business. A suggested Order of Business is as follows: 1. Opening. 2. Reading, correcting, and approving of the minutes of all intervening stated and special communications. No vote necessary to approve only a statement by the Master after all corrections are made. 3. Reading and receiving of petitions. (See Chapter 68 an d 70 of the Code). Assign Investigating Committee. 4. Reports of Investigating Committees on petitions. (See Chapter 70 of the Code). 5. Balloting on petitions. (See Chapter II & 72 of Code for quality of ballot required, and the cipher for balloting procedure.) 6. Consideration of any unfinished business. 7. Reading, action taken where required, and order filing of the correspondence. 8. Reading and approval of the bills. These should have th e signature approval of the Finance Committee before being presented. The vote is a show of hands with simple majority required to approve. 9. Consideration of new business. 10. Conferral of degrees. 11. Closing "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 C. Special Communications. Special communications may be called by th e Master by notice to the members, eith er direct, by mail, or at a previous stated communication, but only the work for which the \"Special\" is called ma y be conducted at the meeting. Two special communications on the same day may not he called unless one of them is for the purpose of conducting a Masonic funeral or Memorial Service. A Special and Slat ed Communication may be held on the same day. D. Rules of Order . No attempt is' being made to cover all of the circumstances under which formalized Rules of Order should apply, but instead, listed below are some of the more common cases whic h should be considered by the Presiding Officer of a Lodge. 1. The Flag of the United States of Amer ica should be displayed on a standard in the East at the Master's right. I t is improper to use the Flag as a drapery fo r the Altar or for decorative purposes. Th e Flag should be given preference over any other banner, emblem, or device used for a similar purpose in a lodge room or when displayed on a Masonic building. 2. The Apron should always be worn on the outside of all clothing, including an overcoat when wearing the Apron out- of-doors. It is improper if it is worn inside or beneath the coat or jacket. 3. The Master's hat is an emblem of superiority of rank a visible sign of his position as the actual head of the lodge. Consequently, it should be worn with dignity set squarely atop the head not over on one side. It should always be removed during prayer and at the mention of the name of Deity, as a sign of reverence and respect; also when giving the Obligations, as a token of the sacredness of the pledges being taken by the candidate. It should be removed in the presence of the Grand Master or his repres entative if the Grand Master or his representative is covered. It may also be removed for comfort and convenience during the business portion of the meeting. 4. The Master may present the gavel to a Brother for the pur pose of proceeding with the work such as conferring of a degree; but it is impossible to extend to him or any other Brother the gavel of\" Authority.\" No one but the Grand Master, or his official representative, is entitled to the transfer of authority in a lodge. Responsibility of a Master of a Masonic lodge remains with him at all times. 5. When a Brother rises to speak, he shall give the pr oper sign, respectfully addr ess himself to the Master, and be recognized before he begins to speak. 6. A petition for the degrees or affiliation is presented to the lodge at a stated mee ting, read, reported, received, noted in the minutes, and maybe referred to an Investigating Committee without any action by the lodge. Ref. Chapter 83 of the Code. 7. When a motion is made and seconded, it should be restated or rejected by the Master. He may, if he so desires, decline to entertain a motion. 8. Motions and reports may be referred to committees at the discretion of the Master, 9. No motion can be permitted which could be in violation of the Grand Lodge Code or the By-Laws of the Constituent Lodge. The Master is the judge of all questions of order and he may refuse to present a motion to the lodge should he feel it to be improper and/or prejudi cial to the welfare of the lodge. 10. All debate ceases at the will and pleasure of the Master. 11. There shall be no debate afte r the motion is put by the Master. 12. Every member present, entitled to vote , shall be required to do so unless excused by the Master when balloting on a petition for the degrees. 13. No appeal lies to a lodge from a decision of the Master. An appeal may be taken only by those against whom the decision has been made and this may be taken only to the Grand Master who will review it subject to final action at the Annual Committee of the Grand Lodge. 14. The Master determines if all officers should wear a tie. He may also choose not to do so if he so desires. 15. A review of Chapter 560ftheCode and Supplement will be of help in determining the prerogatives and restrictions of the Master in conducting the affairs of the lodge. 16. Balloting and voting regulations are frequently an area, which is misunderstood. As they are numerous we have provided herein a reference list for your use. a.) Pages 178-179 of Code lists a Table of Votes, which re ference sections of the Code. Be sure also to check the annotations in Part II of the Code applicable to the section referenced. b.) The Index of the Code under \"Voting in Lodges,\" Ballot, Ballot Box etc. also provides a reference. Education Of The Officers Where were you first prepared to be made an Officer? If th is question has a familiar sound, what follows is automatic where were you next prepared and how were you prepared? If your answer to the last question is that you weren't, then it is high time you gave some thought to educating the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 officers behind you. Does each officer have a book describing his duties and some hints as to how to perform them? If not, you would be making a major contribution to your lodge by starting such a set of instructional aids. Your Past Masters Organization could be called upon to assist you in this effort they undoubtedly would be delighted to be given a chance to help in such a project. Do your officers have an opportunity to be educated in Masonic Practices and Masonic History? If not, you should consider taking steps to rectify the situation. On ce again, your Past Masters could be of help. The Grand Lodge Committee on Masonic Education is consid ering a program of education for the officers of all Symbolic Lodges. Your suggestions along these lines would be welcome! A Leadership Training Course The Masonic Service Association in conjunction with Imagination Unlimited has developed a Masonic Leadership Course entitled More Light in Masonry. Th is course consists of five cassettes, ten lessons plus a workbook with guides for action, questions and suggestions. This audio program has been deemed a \"Masonic Survival Kit,\" and we strongly recommend it to any and all lodge officers, particularly if your lodge is in trouble the advice is excellent. It is available from Imagination Unlimited, Box 70, Highland Springs, Virginia 23075. Additional Workbooks are also available from Imagination Unlimited. Planning a Budget Lodge By-Laws should require the Finance Committee to submit a budget for approval of the lodge early in the year. The Master who goes into office knowi ng what the lodge faces in fixed expend itures Grand Lodge per capita, rent, heat, light, taxes, salaries. average repair, av erage charity appropriations, entertainment appropriations and so on, can calculate where he needs to cut corners, if any, and how he must finance any programs which he envisions. Chapter 9 of Carl Claudy's \"The Master's Book\" contains much advice on the subject of Lodge Finances. You are urged to read this in its entirety. Masters have in the past put an interesting program onto their Trestleboard only to discover that the program would have to be dropped or dras tically curtailed due to the lack of adequate funds. This unpleasant experience can be avoided by the careful preparation of a Lodge budget while planning your term. The preparation of the budget provides the Wardens with inva luable experience, as to the actual operation expenses of their Lodge. By keeping the format in a simple, straight forward manner, the members can evaluate it fairly at its presentation. A study of past income and expense per member versus dues can be helpful to the members of the Lodge: and the Master in determining the Lodges activities. Your b udget should fit your Lodges programs and activities. A sample budget for an imaginary Lodge of 125 members is provided as an example. Receipts 03 est. 03 act. 04 est. 04 act.

For this reason we have chosen it as an example of How to Plan An Event. Every Master has the responsibility of seeing that his successo r is duly installed; therefore it is only proper for you to begin your planning with a discussion of the event with your Worshipful Master. The two of you should agree on the format of the installation and who is to perform the installation. Once you have decided on a format for your installation you will need to make a timetable so that you don't forget anything. For illustrative purposes, we have assumed a full-blown public installation preceded by a dinner and followed by a reception. This is not to be interp reted as meaning that these are necessary for a successful installation. The form and extent of the proceedings should tit the situation of the lodge and its budget. Familiarize yourself with the \"Ceremony of Installation\" prepared in 1974 by \"The Committee on Masonic Education, and directed for use by Grand Master Robert E. Billings in 1975. Additional copies can be obtained by contacting the Grand Secretary. A sample timetable is provided as a thought starte r. Adapt it as it fits you and your Lodge needs. 2 to 6 Months Prior: 1. You should consult with your Worshipful Master and the two of you should agree on the format of the installation and who is to perform the installation. 2. Select night, and reserve dining room and Masonic Temple. 3. Distinguished guests and important participants su ch as Installing Officer, Speaker, Toastmaster, Singer, Organist and Master of Ceremonies should be decided upon, invited and commitment obtained. 4. If a reception is planned afterwards, arrange for so meone to take responsibility. 1 to 2 Months Prior: 5. If a dinner is planned, contact dining room staff or possible menus and prices and make choice. Assign one man as liaison. 6. Decide upon, invite and get commitments from balance of necessary personnel to install officers. 7. Decide details of dinner program su ch as music, speaker time, introductions of distinguished guests (smart to limit to Past Masters and heads of Masonic Bodies. etc.) 8. Agree on menu and price and begin preliminary planning of the format of the printed program. NOTE: Immediately after Lodge's election have printed programs completed and delivered for printing. 9. Arrange for pictures of WM elect so that cuts are available for the Ma sonic Journal and local paper. Arrange story for former by November 15. Detail someone to this. Also detail someone for publicity in latter before installation and following last Lodge's election. 10. Arrange for decorating Lo dge and reception room. 11. Consider special invitations for widows of deceased P.M. and transpor tation if they accept and need it. 2 Weeks Prior: 12. Lodge officers informed as to time and date of rehearsal. Other participants informed as to time and date of rehearsal. 13. Decide what special seats are required. (Wives of Jr . P.M.s, families of WM elect, wives of distinguished - guests, etc.) 14. Decide if you want P.A. system and arrange for one if needed. Rehearsal Night: 15. Explain, Installation Ceremony by Installing Officer. After explanation conduct complete installation ceremony to assure everyone knows the sequence. Nothing creates a negative image to the public like an Installing Team or group of officers being installed wh o obviously don't know what will happen next or who don't execute as a Masonic Lodge should. Make your mist akes during rehearsal not during the installation. Keep at it until everyone feels at ease with the ceremony. 16. Complete a list of all introductions planned in step 7. Is it still complete? If the list is long try to cut it but if necessary end on the side of good protocol. The person forgotten is remembered much longer than if the introductions took an extra several minutes. 17. Arrange for water at the podium for the night of Installation. Installation Night Relax: if you planned it well and rehearsed it properly; all will go smoothly as it should. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 Check List For Pl anning Meetings In the section of this guide called\" Lodge Organization and Administration\" some information on conducting a state meeting, is provided. Here we will try to give some ideas regarding a \"special\" which may also be open to the public. 1. Define Purpose and Objective of meeting in simple terms write it down, and revise it if necessary as the whole plan is developed. What do we want to achieve, who do we wa nt to reach, how large an audience? Draft activities outline speaker, entertainment, etc. - Make tentative AGENDA. 2. Communication. How do we tell the story to everyone? We need to be sure everyone \"gets the word\" and we must get a \"feed-back\" to know what he intends to do. For example: We send a double postal reply card (use a business reply permit, not postage) announcing the event and asking for a reply and reservation (or regrets) we also need a telephone committee to follow up on the \"no reply\" cards to know where we stand before the big day. There are many ways to communicate besides mail, but no system will be successful unless it has \"feedback.'\" Nothing is worse than just announcing a meeting, estimating the attendance, setting up th e tables, and then having only a few show up. It has happened! 3. Motivation. It is necessary to create the interest that motivates people to action. This must be done before the reservation stage. Use the \"build up\" to make people want to come to our event instead of some other (like TV). Get everyone talking it up enthusiastically. Appoint a publicity chairm an. Prepare NEWS RELEASES for all the newspapers in the area and deliver them personally if possible. Don't forget Radio and TV many stations like local event announcements. 4. Start Early. Send reservation cards 14 to 20 days befo re the event. The bigger the event the more lead time for planning and advance work we need. Last minute plans just do not work out; there is too much competition for a man's time. If it is planned to include Masons from other Lodges allow plenty of time to spread the word and get the answers back. 5. Make sure your date has as little or no conflict with other organizations or events which will compete for your prospective audiences time. . 6. Committees - Appoint committee for arrangements (place, food, reception, parking, decorations, etc.) program. 7. Finalize Agenda and Arrangement Plans On paper. Fo llow up on committees and have them report progress to General Chairman. Don't forget to plan in advance for invocation and benediction if occasion normally calls for it. 8. Reception of Guests. This is very impor tant extend the very best in hospitality. Depending on the type of the event, determine if any of the guests should be \"heard from\" - check with them in advance. Protocol etc. is important and difficult if one is not experience, ask for expert assistance if you do not know, but do not just let things come naturally, they won't. 9. Start on Time. When you finally come to the big event. This is the Chairman's responsibility. Keep it moving according to well-prepared final agenda. Quit on time and on a high note - you will get people back another time this way - let it drag, be filled with gaps, trivia and th e like and people will think twice about coming again. 10. Speakers or Entertainers. Discuss time of talk with sp eaker in advance. Confirm all agreements in writing for his record and yours so there will be no misunderstanding. Discuss fee if any and expenses in a dvance. Include time, place, dress, transportation, etc, If out of town the least we can do is provide lodging. Don't forget the wife! 11.Thank You's. A prompt note after the event to the speaker and outstanding helpers is always appreciated. A letter to a company speaker's boss with carbon to speaker makes more points. If no fee, don't overlook some token gift. A good committeeman can help you on these things. 12. Good Luck - have a successful event – planning will guarantee it. You are urged to make use of this checklist for everyone of your events including your installation. A Lodge System Of Education Introduction The following program is designed to be flexible to be adopted in part or in whole. Each lodge is urged to adopt whatever part it feels it can handle and do well. For many years Wisconsin has had a Counselor program, which unfortunately has accomplished only part of what it was intended to do. It is hoped that this section will rekindle interest in the Counselor program and give you some material upon which to build your \"Counselor\" and Lodge Education Program. Education System Outline. The Lodge System of Masonic Education has as its sole ai m to guarantee that every ca ndidate and every member who comes to lodge shall be properly instructed in those principl es and practices of Freemasonry which are so essential to the well-being and edification of all mankind."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 The machinery is a Lodge Co mmittee on Education headed by a Lodge Education Officer and staffed by a few brothers acting as candidate counselors and Committeemen in ch arge of \"sideline\" education, all of whom are appointed by the Worshipful Master. The method of instruction is of two types - (1) the members on the sidelines are offered two to ten minute educational programs at each and every communication; (2) The candid ate meets with a counselor twice before taking the First Degree, once after taking each Degree and. preferably, at leas t once each month for the first calendar year after receiving his Third Degree. An Education Program For The \"Sidelines\" \"Through the improvement and strengthening of the character of the individual man, Freemasonry seeks to improve the community. Thus, it impresses upon its members the principles of personal righteousness and personal responsibility, enlightens them as to those things which make for human welfar e, and inspires them with that feeling of charity or good will, toward all mankind which will move them to translate principle and conviction into action.\" For all too many years the Masonic Fraternity has failed to live up to this ideal. How many times have we inducted candidates into various degrees and then forgotten them after they were raised'! This should not be permitted to continue. I t is the responsibility of every Master to see that his lodge program includes true Masonic Education. A. Format Less than ten minutes a night is all that is required. Under no circumstances should the ten minutes come just before the close of lodge. Save it for the buffet room afterward or pu t it early in your schedule for the evening when there is a gap in the lodge proceedings. These programs, above all else, must be quality. No dull and dreary readings, no soporific clichés or pompous pronouncements. The programs should be inspirational, enlightening and interesting. Keep them short and to the point if interest and conversations continue after the program is fini shed that is marvelous, but let it continue informally over refreshments. Such should be the guidelines. B. Content The contents of this Education Program should be under the control of the Worshipful Master. He should identify the man who is to act as his Lodge Education Officer early in his year as Senior Warden and work closely with this man in preparing the Education Progra m for his year as Master. The resources for such a program are huge. The Masonic lite rature is extensive and low cost. (See later section - Masonic Library for the Lodge). The Counselor Program More than 400 years ago, the Intender was an important o fficial in the old operative Lodges' of Scotland, entrusted with the instruction of new candidates. . At that time the word \"intend\" had a slightly different meaning than it does now it meant, \"to stretch out, extend, expand, increase, and intensify. \"Therefore, the Intender was a faithful companion and teacher whose duty it was to stretch out, extend, expand, increase an d intensify the knowledge and understand ing of the younger craftsman in the science of Masonry. . In retaining this function under the title Counselor in our lo dges of today we are maintaining and extending our ties to the ancient craft It is hoped that those brothers bearing this name will feel the pride and responsibility that such a title implies. To the candidate the Counselor will be Masonry personified. It is imperative; therefore, that the Counselor exemplify all that is good about our fraternity. Narrow mindedness, personal recriminations, authoritarianism and other inconsiderate and unmasonic behavior are to be carefully and dutifully avoided. Freemasonry must be taught according to Masonic principles, in a spirit of consideration, patience and love. A suggested sequence for setting up such an Education System if your Lodge doesn't have one is listed in the following steps 1-10. It attempts to update and supplement the \"Counselor Handbook\" available from the Grand Secretary's Office. 1. The Worshipful Master appoints a Committee, consisting of a Lodge Education Officer and as many Counselor and Committeemen as he needs (small lodges may need no add itional members whereas larger lodges may need several). This Committee is to meet at regularly spaced intervals. . 2. The Lodge Education Officer has the responsibility to coordinate the work of the Counselors, act as a Counselor himself, and together with the Worshipful Master to plan and execute a Lodge Program of Masonic Education for the benefit of the brothe rs attending lodge. There s hould be a two to ten minute e ducational program at each and every communication. These programs may be offered in tiled lo dge or in the buffet room afterward in most instances, the latter is to be recommended. 3. One or two Committeemen may be appointed by the Worshipful Master to assist the Lodge Education Officer in planning and presenting th e Lodge Education Program."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 4. After a petition has been favorably balloted upon, the candida te is notified by the Secretary that a member of this Lodge has been assigned as his \"Couns elor\" and that the Counselor will call upon the candidate shortly to acquaint him with certain facts about Freemasonry an d to answer any questions which he ma y have. The candidate, of course, will without question, welcome the Counselor into his home or me et with the Counselor at a mutually agreed upon location because he will accept this as one of the duties incident to his Initiation. 5. At this first meeting the Counselor should present the candidate with the booklet entitled \"Seeking Light in Masonry\" and answer whatever questions the candidate and his wife may have in regard to his upcoming Initiation. It is, in fact, the responsibility of the Counselor to see that the candidate is properly instructed in the material contained in these booklets and that he receives such information about the principles and teachings of Masonry as will give him a clear understanding of what kind of soci ety it is that he is about to enter. 6. The Counselor is to take responsibility for informing th e signers of the petition and the investigating committee of the time of the candidate's initiation and further degrees, ther eby ensuring that these brothers are there on the sidelines at each and everyone of his degrees. 7. The candidate will meet with his Counselor four more ti mes, once more before he receives his Entered Apprentice Degree and once after each of the Degrees. By the time that he is read y to consummate his member ship he will be able to do so intelligently. 8. After the receipt of each degree and fo r the next twelve calendar months it is the responsibility of the Counselor to bring the newly made brother to his own lodge and to neighboring lodges as regularly as possible. The brother is to be presented with each of the other bookle ts, entitled Light in Masonry, More Li ght in Masonry and Further Light in Masonry, after each appropriate degree and urged to continue his Masonic-Education on his own. 9. It is recommended that the lodge present the brother at regularly spaced intervals (ca. one month) several Masonic paperbacks in the order given below: An Introduction to Freemasonry by H.L. Haywood Masonry Under Two Flags by Allen E. Roberts The Builders by Joseph Fort Newton If the Lodge does not wish to offer these as presents the brot hers should be told that they are available from the Lodge Secretary at the Lodges cost. These boo ks are chosen to introduce the brother to the literature of Masonry in the hope that his appetite may be whetted for further study. 10. The Lodge Education Officer should act as liaison betw een the Lodge Educa tion Committee, the Worshipful Master and the Grand Lodge Committee on Masonic Education. He should regularly call and chair a meeting of the Lodge Education Committee (four such meetings per year is recommended). At these m eetings the Counselors should share their experiences and methods and help plan (but not execute I the Lodge Education Program. A brief annual report is requested to be made by each Lodge Education Committee w ith a description of the succ ess or failure of the local program and of the needs of the Lodge for additional help and materials. Please send to \"Grand Lodge” at 36275 Sunset Drive, Dousman, WI 53118. A Masonic Library For The Lodge Masonic education is lacking in many of Symbolic Lodges. Many Brethren are hungry to learn Masonic history and even more desirous to learn Masonic practices. The ready availability of Masonic books could do wonders in satisfying these needs. Every lodge should have a library of Ma sonic books so that the material may be available to those officers and members who desire to enjoy the' adventure of Masonic reading. If the lodge does not have a place to keep the books, consideration should be given to securing the books, presenting them to the local public library, and periodically informing the members that th e books are available for their' use and enjoyment. If the lodge cannot afford to buy any Masonic books it is suggested that specific interested members be requested to buy a book and to read it; as the books are read they should be exchanged so that each book is read by each member who bought a book; when this has been done the books can be given to the lodge as gifts. This project would enable the members for the price of one book to read a large number of books and at the same time do the lodge a good turn. The following list of books is suggested for careful consideration . The source is listed by a number in parentheses with the number identifying the source at the end of the list.

Excerpted from Vol. IX, No. 4, April, 1931 \"The Short Talk Bulletin of the Masonic Servic e Association of the United States”. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 THE WARDENS The office of Warden is very old; older, probably, than an y reference we will ever find in documents relating to the Craft. All through our organizati on the influence of the Gilds of the middle ages may be tr aced; occasionally with ease, more often by the methods of a \"higher criticism\" which read analogies by inference and a logical interpretation of the spirit of a document. That Freemasonry derived its Wardens from the Gilds, however, needs no very critical labor to suggest. The Gilds of the Middle Ages acted under royal charters or warrants, or similar instruments given by more local authority. The legal protection enabled them to work with more freedom for the good of all and gave the chartering authority some semblance of control. In the Libre Albus, or White Book of the City of London dated 1419 we find the \"Oath of the Masters and Wardens of the Mysteries.\" which was applicable to an y Gild - weavers, metal workers, masons, or others. It reads: You shall swear that well and lawful you shall overlook the art or mystery of...............of which you are Masters, or Wardens, for the year elected. And the good rules and ordinances of the same mystery, approved here by the Court, you shall keep and cause to be kept. And all the defaults that you shall find therein, done contrary thereto, you shall present to the Chamberlain of the City, from time to time, sparing no one for favour, and aggrieving no one for hate. Extortion or wrong unto no one, by colour of your of fice, you shall do; nor unto anything that shall be against the estate and peace of the King, or of the City, you shall consent. But for the time that you shall be in office, in all things pertaining unto the said mystery, according to the good laws and franchises of the said City, well and lawfully you shall behave yourself. So God you help, and the Saints. The Harleian manuscript, the probable date of which is 1660, states that: For the future the Sayd Society, Comp any and Fraternity of Free Masons sh all be regulated and governed by One Master and Assembly and Wardens as the said Company sh all think to choose, at every yearly General Assembly. It seems strange to modern ears, but it is a fact that the Wardens of a lodge prior to some date between 1723 and 1738 were always chosen from the Fellows of the Craft. In the first edition of Anderson's Constitutions, published in 1723, under the \"Manner of Constituting a New Lodge, as practiced by his Grace the Duke of Wharton, the present Right Worshipful Grand Master, according to the ancient usages of Masons\" we read: \"The new Master and Wardens being yet among the Fellow-Craft.\" After the newly elected Master is installed he calls forth \"two Fe llow-Craft, presents them to the Grand Master for his approbation\" and when that is secured they are duly installed as Wardens. At that early date a Deputy Grand Master could be chosen from the ranks of the Fellows. The 17th Regulation states: \"If the Deputy Grand Master be sick, or necessarily absent, the Grand Master may choose any Fellow-Craft he pleases to be his deputy pro tempore.” In 1738, when the Book of Constitutions was published, the Wardens, Tiler, Assistant Tr easurer and Secretary had to be Master Masons. Perhaps no ancient usage and custom of the Fraternity is more universal than the government of lodges by a Master and two Wardens. Mackey lists this requirement as his Tenth Landmark, and whether they have adopted Mackey's twenty-five landmarks or not, all Grand Lodges recognize the Wardens as essential in the formation, opening and governing of a lodge. The three principal officers of a lodge are universally recogn ized in the ritual as the essential elements of which a lodge must consist. Only the uninstructed Mason regards the stations of Senior and Junior Wardens as but stepping stones to the East; necessary waiting posts to which the ambitious must stand hitched for a year before proceeding on his triumphal journey to the Oriental Chair! Not only are the Wardens essential to every Entered Appren tices', Fellow Crafts' or Master Masons' Lodge, but they have certain inherent powers, duties and responsibilities. Mackey sets these forth substantially as follows: While a Master may use others than the Wardens in the conferring of the degrees, he cannot deprive the Wardens of their offices, or absolve them of their responsibilities. The government of a Masonic lodge is essentially tripartite, although lodges may be legally opened, set to labor and closed by the Master in the absence of the installed Ward ens, the chairs being filled by temporary appointments. The Senior Warden presides in the absence of the Master, and the Junior Warden in the absence of both Master and Senior Warden. No other brethren in the lodge have this power, privilege , or responsibility, The Warden who presides in the absence of his superior officer may, if he desires, call a Past Master to the chair to preside for him, but no Past Master, in the absence of the Master, may lega lly congregate the lodge. The Master, the Senior Warden in absence of the Master, or the Junior Warden in the absence of both must do that. Mackey further states that while the Se nior Warden takes the East by right in the absence of the Master, the Junior Warden does not take the West by right in the absence of th e Senior Warden. Each officer is installed with a ceremony, which gives him certain duties; a Warden in the East is still a Warden, not a Master. It is the Master's privilege to appoint brethren to stations temporarily unfilled, The Master, whether elected and installed, or Senior Warden acting as Master in"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 the real Master's absence, may appoint the Junior Warden to fill an empty West. But the Junior Warden cannot assume the West without such appointment. On the contrary, in the absence of the Master, the Seni or Warden, when present, is the only brother who can assume th e East and congregate the lodge. Thus runs the general law, generally adhered to. As has been noted in other Bulletins, Grand Lodges may, and not infrequently do, make local regulations contrary to the Ol d Constitutions, the Old Charges, even the Landmarks - the fundamental law of Masonry. If a Grand Lodge rules that in the absence of Master and bot h Wardens, the oldest Past Ma ster present may congregate, open, and close the lodge, that law is correct for that Grand Lodge, but is not in consonance with general Masonic practice, nor with the fundamental laws of the Fraternity. The Wardens are found in all bodies of Masonry, in all Rites, in all countries. Both its derivation, and its translations give the meaning of the word. It comes from the Saxon weardian, to guard, to watch, In France, the second and th ird officers are premier and second Surv eillant; in Germany, erste and zwite Aufseher, in Spain, pruner and segundo Vigilante; in Ital y; primo and secondo Sorvegliante, all the words meaning to overlook, to see, to watch, to keep ward, to observe. Whether the title came from the provision of the old rituals that the Wardens sit beside the two columns in the porch of the temple to oversee or watch, the Senior Warden the Fello wcrafts and the Junior Warden the Apprentices; or whether the old rituals were developed from the custom of the Middle Ages Gilds having Wardens (watchers), is a moot question. In the French Rite and the Scottish Rite both Wardens sit in the West, near the columns. In the Blue Lodge the symbolism is somewhat impaired by the Junior Warden, sitting in th e South, but is strengthen ed by giving each Warden a replica of the column beneath the shade of which he once sat. It is interesting to note that these columns once went by another name. Oliver quotes an inventory of a Lodge at Chester, in 1761, which includes \"two truncheons for the Wardens,\" Truncheons or Columns, they are the Wardens' emblems of authority, and their positions are of great interest. The column of the Senior Warden is erect, that of the Junior on its side, while the lodge is at labor. During refreshment, the Senior Warden's column is laid prostrate, while that of the Junior is erected, so that the Craft may know at all times, by a glance at either South or West, whether the Lodge is at labor or refreshment. The Government of the Craft by a Master and two Wardens cannot be too strongly emphasized to the initiate or too well observed by the Craft. It is not only the right but the duty of the Senior Warden to \"assist the Worshipful Master in opening and governing his lodge.\" When he uses it to enforce orders, his selling maul or gavel is to be respected; he has a \"proper officer\" to carry' his messages to the Junior Warden or elsewhere; under the Master, he is responsible for the conduct of the Lodge while at labor. The Junior Warden's duties are less important; he observes the time, and calls the lodge from labor to refreshment and refreshment to labor in due season at th e orders of the Master. It is his duty to see that \"none of the Craft convert the purposes of refreshment into intemperance and excess\" which doubtless has a bibulous derivation, coming from days when \"refreshment\" meant wine. If we no longer drink wine at lodge, we still have reason for this charge upon the Junior Warden, since it is his unpleasant duty; because he supervises the conduct of the Craft at refreshment, to prefer charges against those guilty of Masonic misconduct. Only Wardens may succeed to the office of Master. This requirement (which has certa in exceptions, as in the formation of a new Lodge) is very old. The fourth of the Old Charges reads: ' No brother can be a Warden until he has passed the part of a Fellow Craft; nor a Master, until he has acted as Warden; nor Grand Warden, until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor Grand Master, unless he has been a Fellow craft before his election. There is wisdom in the old law; there is wit in the modern practice of electing the Junior Warden to be Senior Warden. No man learns to be Master of a lodge by sitting upon the be nches and observing. No brother's fitness to be Master can be observed by brethren unless he is tested. Brethren learn, and are tested as to how they learn and perform, by serving as Wardens, before they aspire to the Oriental Chair. , A privilege equally high is that of the Wardens in most Ju risdictions; representing the lodge with the Master at all Communications of the Grand Lodge. Certain Grand Lodges disenfranchise the Wardens, the Grand Lodge consisting only of the Masters of constituent lodges and th e officers and past officers of Grand Lodge. Prior to the formation of the Mother Grand Lodge of Englan d, in 1717, it was the prerogative of every Mason to be present at the General Assembly and to have his voice in its affairs. When the Grand Lodge was brought into being by the \"four old lodges\" of London, the interests of all were entrusted to the Masters and Wardens. Preston states that \"The Masters and Wardens or all regular particular lodges upon record\" form the Grand Lodge. Of the action of Grand Lodges, which deprive the Wardens of membership in the Grand Lodge, Mackey states: I cannot hesitate to say that this is not only a violation of the ancient regulations, but also an infraction of the inherent rights of the Wardens and the Lodges. This appears to many as going too far. If the brethren of the old General Assembly could give up their rights to a voice in its deliberations, and entrust their interest to Masters and Wardens in a Grand Lodge. it seems not unreasonable that these Masters and Wardens, as a Grand Lodge, have a right to deprive themselves of memb ership when the good of the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 whole requires it. The Warden’s is a high and exalted office: his duties are many, his res ponsibilities great; his powe rs only exceeded by those of the Master. He is a good Warden who so acts in hi s South or West as to command for himself the respect of the brethren, rather than demand it because of law and custom. Lodge Programming Despite all of the rules, regulations, instructions, and suggestions that we can lay down with respect to officers' duties, committee work, and effective lodge admini stration and operation, prob ably the most effective single facet in making and keeping our lodges dynamic is the extent to which programs are planned and executed. This statement applies not only to the planning of entertainment type programs but includes, as well, in the term \"programs\" the balancing of such activities as good ritualistic work, complete instruction to candidates on Masonry's tenets and purposes, continuing education for the membership, developing charitable activities, and all other activities related to a \"well rounded lodge program.\" The purpose of this section is to discuss the individual prog ram as presented at a lodge meeting, which, often will have influence on a continuing pr ogram of a specific nature. Special attention must be given by the Wardens to the absolute necessity of program planning and arrangements well in advance of the time for installation. The Chairman of th e Program Committee must also be selected well in advance of the new year because he, with the Senior Warden must begin constructing the program trestle board no later than during the fourth quarter of the current year. Probably most lodge officers would pl ace attendance at the top of the list of problems involving the successful operation of a Masonic Lodge. When a lodge is troubled with attendance, it is the most nagging and harassing problem of all. The members, who do not come to lodge are not entirely to blame - the sad fact is there may be little to make them want to come, or if they do come there may be so often little to make them want to come back. For many years, in some cases lodge o fficers have drifted into a sense of comp lacency by assuming that the conferring of degrees is the most important - and perhaps the only - business of the lodge. Of course the conferring of degrees in a dignified and impressive manner is important - it is the door through which a man enters the Masonic edifice. After the door has been op ened, a man hopes that he will find warmth and respect and affection and many other things, which makes him glad he came through the door. There is so much more to Freemasonry than the degrees on ly -- there has to be! ' Every Mason is entitled to more than th e initial impressive ritualistic experien ce. He wants to take his place in a Fraternity that has been of tremendous importance in our world for countless ag es. He receives our impressive degrees and proudly awaits further Masonic knowledge, but the bitter fact s of life are that here the story ends for some Masons. We want to try to prevent his adopting the philosophy so often expressed about many events - \"you see one, you've seen them all\". Good attendance and a resulting successful lodge can be achieved of any set of lodge officers with the serious application of imagination and enthusiasm - but it is only th e officers who can achieve this - no one else, including the Grand Master himself. Leadership and th e resulting success cannot be legislated but the members of a lodge have a right to expect a very REAL EFFORT to provide and display it. At the risk of over simplifying the problem and its solution le t us be acutely aware of thes e two very basic premises or goals that have to be accomplished. (1) Attract your memb ers into the lodge room, and (2) make them want to come back! \"It should be emphasized that the duty of a Master is first to the members of his Lodge; the possibility of much 'work' on many candidates should be a secondary consideration,\" Such is the advice of Carl Claudy and we can only add \"So Mote It Be.\" As you plan your activities for th e year, this should be your guiding principle. Many lodges are complaining about poor attendance and fa lling membership. If you look at their calendars you will probably find them occupied by regular communications which have nothing but lodge business and degree nights that have nothing but what is in the ritual. Nothing could be better calculated to “turn off membership\" than this. Variety is the spice of life, and there is no substitute. If you want the brothers to come to lodge you must give them something besides “the standard fare”. To do this wi11 require planning. All officers, and particularly Masters, must remember th at great accomplishments rarely happen accidentally, but are the result of study, planning, and hard work. Van Cliborn didn't accidentally beca me a great pianist; he accomplished it by expanding his talent with study and practice. Freema sonry didn't evolve accidentally; it evolved because our forefathers studied and planned and labored. Nor can it be kept alive and viable unless those charged with its leadership, study and plan and execute. No institution can remain static; it will either grow or die. Don't let death be born in your administration. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 What You Need To Know Before You Can Plan As you start to plan the calendar for the year it is helpful to begin by compiling some background of facts concerning, a) National Holidays, Holy Da ys and Commemorative Days b) Community, State and National Events c) Historical Events and Committed Dates in Masonry - Lodge of Instruction, Area Conference, Grand Lodge, St. John's Day, Washington's Birthday. d) Sports Events - Opening day of Trout Season, Opening Day of Bird Season, Snowmob ile Race, Deer Season. e) Continuing Programs in Your Lodge - Annual Communication, Ladies Night, Life Member and Old Timers Night, Trip to Masonic Home, Past Masters Night, Craft Team Dinner, Tri-Lodge Family Picnic, f) Average Number of Candidates per Year (Last 3 years). g) Number of Candidates , EA’s and FC’s held over. h) Visitations planned i) Copy of the \"Wisconsin Masonic Calendar”.

Suggestions for Programs There are many program ideas and special days that each Lo dge can convert into Masonic instruction and information concealed beneath a covering of pleasure and amusement. Th e Lodge must perform this wo rk itself under the guidance and direction of the Master. He may assign a program or a sp ecial day to one Brother to develop and implement. He may name a committee. It cannot be done by someone miles away from your city or town who is not familiar with the talents and abilities of your Brethren. Therefore, we offer program ideas only as suggestions for your consideration. You should pick and choose careful1y. You are urged to include in your calendar at least one lodge program per month. In planning these programs you should bear the fol1owing in mind. The unique thing we have to give to \"our members is Masonry! They can buy better meals and see better shows' than the lodg e usual1y provides, but they are not likely to find the teachings of Masonry inculcated elsewhere. A Sample Calendar A sample calendar has been prepared with references to aid you in using some of the material for your own calendar. Such a calendar should be prepared, dupli cated and distributed to al1 present at the first regular communication. To do this means that you should begin its preparation early in your year as Sr. Warden. Please notice that the special Masonic entertainment is pr ovided by members of the Lo dge.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\" There are many famous artists and musicians who were Maso ns - Mozart was one of these. He wrote several pieces specifically for Masonic occasions. His Ma sonic history can be found in any Maso nic Encyclopedia. A summary of this history together with an airing of one of his Masonic works would make an excellent presentation in lodge.

(3) Family Christmas Program (Potluck at 6:30 PM) Special guest \"Santa Claus.\" Let Us Briefly Analyze The Sample Calendar - We have incorporated the following: 1. Several different brothers, one for each night, in presenting the short special entertainment. 2. At least one and sometimes two lodge programs a month. 3. Never more than two degree nights in one month (in fact we have 2 months with 2, 5 months with 1 and 5 months with none).

These may be found in pp. 154-162 of Roscoe Pound's Masonic Addresses and Writings. 33. \"Not Blotted\" is another short story which carries a moral lesson. It can be found in Claudy's, \"These Were Brethren.” 34.

In 1922 the Order of DeMolay came to Wisconsin. In 1961 the Grand Lodge voted to sponsor DeMolay. Today the Grand Lodge is a member organization of the United Masonic Board for DeMolay in Wisconsin Inc., which represents all the branches of Masonry. Th ere are 44 DeMolay Chapters in Wisconsin with a total membership of 1600 young men. Much remains to be done for and with the young men of DeMolay. Your lodge should consider some of the following areas of involvement with a DeMolay Chapter: Installations Invite a DeMolay Chapter to act as an Honor Guard to the Inst alling Officers and the officers to be installed. Invite the DeMolays to act as escorts or ushers to all who attend the lo dge installation. The Lodge may in turn volunteer to form an Honor Guard or act as escorts or ushers at a DeMolay Installation. Dinners \"Masonic Youth Nights\" host a dinner in honor of any of the Masonic youth groups, Job's Daughters, Rainbow Girls and DeMolay young men. Invite the presidi ng officers of each of the youth groups to present a short, 3 to 5 minute, talk on their organization. The lodge in turn may present a program about Masonry to the youth; however, conclude the dinner program with some \"fun\" entertainment. Athletics Challenge a DeMolay Chapter to a three game bowling tournament and the Lodge provides the refreshments. Baseball being a national pastime, plan an annual baseball game with a DeMolay Chapter Work Projects The Order of DeMolay recognizing the debt that DeMolay has to the Masonic Fraternity will award to a young man in DeMolay a \"Masonic Service\" merit bar. DeMolays earn th is merit bar by participating in three different Masonic service projects with a minimum of ten hours without fi nancial remuneration to either individual or chapter."}]
