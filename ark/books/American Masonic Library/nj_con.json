A Mason is obliged by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancient Times Masons were charged in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more ex - pedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves; that is, to be good Men and true, or men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasions they"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"cHARGE II. may be distinguished; whereby Masonry be - comes the centre of Union, and the means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remained at a perpetual distance. CHARGE II. Of the CIVIL MAGISTRATE Supreme and subordinate. A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior Magistrates; for as Masonry hatli been always injured by War, Bloodshed, and Confusion, so ancient Kings and Princes have been much disposed to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their Peaceableness and Loyalty, whereby they practically answered the cavils of their Adversaries, and promoted the Honour of the Pi-aternity, whoever flourished in Tilnes of Peace. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the state, he is not to be countenanced in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man; and if convicted of no other CHARGE III. ‘49 crime, though the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealously to the Government for the time being; they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his Relation to it remains indefeasible. CHARGE III. Of LODGES. A LODGE is a Place where A/Iasons assemble and work. Hence that Assembly, or duly or - ganized Society of Masons, is called a LODGE, and every Brother ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its By-Laws and the GENERAL REGULATIONS. It is either particular or general, and will -be best understood by attending it, and by the Regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annexed. In ancient Times, no Master or Fellowi could be absent from it, espe - cially when warned to appear at it, without in - curring a severe censure, until it appeared to the Master and Wa~rdens, that pure Necessity hindered him. The Persons admitted members of a Lodge, must be good ~and true Men, free born, and of 1 148"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"150 CHARGE Iv. mature and discreet Age, no Bondmen, no Women, no immoral or scandalous Men, but of good Report. CHARGE IV. Of MASTERS, WARDENS, Fellows, and Apprentices. All preferment among Masons is grounded upon real Worth and personal Merit only; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to Shame, nor the Royal Craft despised: Therefore no Master or War - den is chosen by Seniority, but for his Merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writ - ing, and every Brother must attend in his Place, and learn them in a way peculiar to this Fra - ternity. Only Castdidates may know, that no Master should take an Apprentice, unless he has sufficient Imployment for him, and unless he be a perfect Youth, having no Maim or Defect in his Body, that may render him uncapable of learning the Art, of serving his Master’s LORD, and of being made a Brother, and then a Fellow Craft in due time, even after he has served such a Term of Years as the Custom of CHARGE IV. 151 the Country directs; and that he should be descended of honest Parents; that so, when otherwise qualified, he may arrive to the Hon - our of being the WARDEN, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the GRAND MASTER of all the Lodges, accord - ing to his Merit. No Brother can be a WARDEN until he has passed the Part of a Fellow C~raft; nor a MAS - TER until he has acted as a Warden, nor GRAND WARDEN until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor GRAND MASTER unless he has been a Fellow Craft before his Election, who is also to be nobly born, or a Gentleman of the best Fashion, or some eminent Scholar, or some curious Architect, or other Artist, descended of honest Parents, and who is of singular great Merit in the Opinion of the Lodges. And for the better, and easier and more honourable Discharge of his Office, the Grand Master has a Power to chuse his own DEPUTY GRAND MASTER, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular Lodge, and has the Privilege of acting whatever the GRAND MAS - TER, his Principal, should act, unless the said I"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"~~1-” -_-_ 152 CHARGE V.

These Rulers and Governors, supreme and su’bordinate of the ancient Lodge, are to be obeyed in their respective Stations by all the Bfethren, according to the old Charges and Rcgulaitions, with all Humility, Reverence, Love and Alacrity.

All Masons shall work honestly on working Days, that they may live creditably on holy Days; and the time appointed by the Law of the Land, or confirmed by Custom, shaLl be observed. The most, expert of the Fellow ‘Craftsmen shall be chosen or appo4ted the Master or Overseer of the Lord’s work; who is to be called MASTER by those that work under him.

I I CHARGE v. ‘53 The Master, knowing himself lo be able of Cunning, shall undertake the Lord’s \\Vork as reasonably as possible, and truly dispend his Goods as if they were his own; nor to give more Wages to any brother or Apprentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons receiving their Wages justly, shall be faithful to the Lord, and honestly finish their Work, whether Task or Journey; nor put the Work to Task that hath been accustomed to Journey. None shall discover Envy at the Prosperity of a Brother, nor supplant him, or put him out of his Work, if he he capable to finish the same; for no Man can finish another’s Work so much to the Lord’s Profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the Designs and Draughts of him that began it.

You are not to hold private Committees, or separate Conversation, without Leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything imperti - nent or unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, Or any Brother speaking to the I I CHARGE VI. ‘55 Master; Nor behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn; nor use any unbecoming Language upon any pretence whatsoever; but to pay due Reverence to your Master, Wardens, and Fellows, and put them to worship. If any Complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the award and De - termination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent Judges of all such controversies (unless you carry it by Appeal to the GRAND LODGE), and to whom they ought to be refer - red, unless a Lord’s Work be hindered the mean while, in which case a particular Refer - ence may be made; but you must never go to Law about what concerneth Masonry, without an absolute necessity apparent to the Lodge. BEHAVIOUR after the LODGE tS over and the BRETHREN not gone. 2. You may enjoy yourselves with innocent Mirth, treating one another according to Abil - ity, but avoiding all Excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his Inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occa - /1"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"156 CHARGE VI. CHARGE VI. 157 sions call him, or doing or saying anything offensive, or that may forbid an easy and free Conversation, for that would blast our Har - mony, and defeat our laudable Purposes. There - fore no private Piques Or Quarrels must be brought within the door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about Religion, or Natio~ns, or State Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholic Religion, above mentioned, we are als 6 of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds and Lan - guages, and are resolved against ALL POLl- TICKS, as what never yet conduced to the Wel - fare of the Lodge, nor ever will.

You are to salute one another in a courte - Otis manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freely giving mutual In - struction as shall be thought expedient, without being overseen or overheard, and without en - croaching upon each other, or derogating from that Respect which is due to any Brother, were he not a Mason: For though all Masons are as Brethren upon the same Level, yet Masonry takes no Honour from a Man that he had be - fore; nay rather it adds to his Honour, espe - cially if he has deserved well of the Brother - hood, who must give Honour to whom it is due, and avoid ill Manners. BEHAVIOUR in Prese~ice of Strangers not MASONS. 4. You shall be cautious in your Words and Carriage, that the most penetrating Stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and sometimes you shall divert a discourse, and manage it prudently for the Honour of the Worsh~ipful Fraterwity. BEX-IAvIOUR at HOME and in your Neighborhood. 5. You are to act as becomes a moral and Wise Man; particularly, not to let your Family, Friends, and Neighbours know the Concerns of the Lodge, &c., but wisely to consult your own Honour, and that of the ancient Brother-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"i58 CHARGE VI. CHARGE V[. 159 hood, for Reasons not to be mentioned here. You must also consult your Health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from Home, after Lodge hours are past; and by avoiding of Gluttony or Drunkenness, that your Families be not neglected, or injured, nor you disabled from Working. BEHAV]OUR towards a Strange Bro they. 6. You are cautiously to examine him, in such a Method as Prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant false Pretender, whom you are to re - j~ct with Contempt and Derision, and beware of~giving him any hints of Knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Brother, you are to respect him accord - ingly; and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be relieved. You must employ him some days, or else recommend him to be employed. But you are not charged to do beyond your Ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, that is a good Man and tri e, before any other poor People in the same circumstances. 4 I FINALLY, All these CHARGES you are to observe, and also those that shall be communi - catUl to you in another way; cultivating BROTHERLY LovE, the Foundation and Cap - stone, the Cement and Glory of this Ancient Fraternity, avoiding all Wrangling and Quar - relling, all Slander and Backbiting, nor per - mitting others to slander any honest Brother, but defending his Character, and doing him all good Offices, as far as is consistent with your Honour and Safety, and no further. And if any of them do you Injury, you must apply to your own or his Lodge; and from thence you may appeal to the GRAND LODGE at the qu4rt- erly Communication, and from thence to the Annual GRAND LODGE, as has been the ancient laudable Conduct of our Forefathers in every nation; never taking a legal Course but when the case cannot be otherwise decided, and patiently listening to the honest and friendly advice of Master and Fellows, when they would prevent your going to Law with Strangers, or would excite you to put a speedy Period to all Lawsuits, that so you may mind the Affair of MASONRY with the more Alacrity and Success, but with respect to Brothers or Fellows at Law,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"i6o CHARG1~ VI. the Master and Brethren should kindly offer their Mediation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the contending Brethren; and if that submission is impracticable, they must however carry on their Process, or Lawsuit, without Wrath and Rancor (not in the com - mon way) saying or doing nothing which may hinder Brotherly Love, and good Offices to be renewed and continued; that all may see the benign Influence of MASONRY, as all true ZI/Iasons have done from the Beginning of the World, and will do to the end of Time.
