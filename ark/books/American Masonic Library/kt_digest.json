APPEARANCE IN PUBLIC Decision No. 11 [Statutes: Sections 214 through 216] Except for church and funeral occasions, public appearances are at the discretion of the Grand Commander. (1940, p. 277, No. 17, Mark Norris, G.M.) Decision No. 12 [Statutes: Sections 214 through 216] The word “public” as used in Templar laws authorizing a Cornmandery to appear in public (funeral occasions and religious services excepted) under a Dispensation issued by the Grand Commander, should bc construed to refer to any meeting place outside of the asylum of the Cornmandery. Thus a visitation of a Cornmandery or its drill patrol in uniform to a Lodge or Chapter would constitute an appearance in public. (1925, p. 398, No. 14, Leonidas Perry Newby, G.M.) Decision No. 13 [Stalutes: Sections 214 through 216] The Giand Commander may give Dispensation to a Cornmandery to appear in full Templar dress in Lodge or Chapter. Such occasions are public appearances.

Decision No. 15 [Stalutes: Sections 214 through 216] There is no Templar prohibition upon the issuance by the Grand Commander of a Dispensation to a Comm andery to appear in full Templar uniform in a parade held as a part of National Defense Day exercises. The issuance of Dis - pensation to appear in Templar uniform in public is a matter resting entiiely in the discretion of the Grand Commander. The question of appropriateness of participation by a Commandery in a public parade is a matter determinable by each Grand Commander. (1925, p. 413, No. 36a, Leonidas Perry Newby, G.M.) Decision No. 16 [Stalutes: Sections 214 through 216] The Grand Commander need not issue a Dispensation to a Commandery permitting the boys of a Chapter of the Order of DeMolay to march on the street with a Commandery and attend divine services at church on Easter Sunday, as the Grand Commandery has no control over the Order of DeMolay, and therefore cannot issue a Dispensation for it to appear in public. No Dispen - salion is necessary for a Commandery to attend divine services or funerals. At’ other times it is solely for the Grand Commander to determine what he con - siders a proper occasion for a Commandery to appear in public in Templar uniform, and his decision is not subject to review.

Decision No. 21 [Statutes: Sections 214 through 216] The Grand Commander may issue a Dispensation to a Constituent Commandery to appear as escort at a religious pageant conducted under the auspices of several Protestant churches. (1952, p. 241, Wo. 22, Robert Brainerd Gaylord, G.M) Decision No. 22 [Statutes: Sections 214 through 216] A Dispensation to appear in Templar uniform as escort to the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Masons at the laying of a cornerstone of a new Presbyterian church on Sunday, being closely allied with and being a religious service, was proper. (1955, p. 184, No. 1, William Ca~ron Gordon, G.M) 7 DIGESr OF DECISIONS Decision No. 23 [Statutes: Sections 214 through 216] A Dispensation from the Grand Commander is necessary for a Commandery to act as escort to the Grand Lodge of A.F. & A.M. for the purpose of laying a cornerstone for a building of the University of Nevada, which was held on Sunday. Whether or not the Grand Commander deemed it a proper occasion for a public appearance rests m his eKclusive determination and judgment. He does not need permission of the Grand Master, nor is he accountable to him in either granting or refusing the Dispensation. (1958, p. 290, No. 27, Walter Allen DeLamater, G.M.)

BALLOT Decision No.29 IConstitution: Section 80; Statutes: Sections 180 through 185] There is nothing m Templar law to prevent a Commandery from considering and balloting on two or more petitions, regularly presented, en masse. If such a ballot is unanunous, each petitioner shall be declared elected; if not, there must be a re-ballot upon each petition separately. (1925, p. 413, No. 36, Leonidas Perry Newby, G.M.) Decision No.30 [Statutes: Section 184] Where the word “ballot” is used in Templar law it means a secret ballot; when the language of the statute is by “vote,” a show of hands is the proper procedure. (1937, p. 339, No. 23, Andrew Davison Agnew, G.M.) Decision No. 31 [Statutes: Sections 183 and 187] A visiting Templar has no right to vote upon a petition for membership in the Commandery, or upon any subject which affects the Commandery. None but members of the Commandery have a nght to casi a ballot. (1928, p. 311, No. 10, George William Vallery, G.M.) Decision No. 32 [Constitution: Section 230)2] The Grand Master has authority to issue a Dispensation to receive a petition and ballot Ihereon at the same Stated Conclave, or at Special Conclaves, after such notice as he may deem proper. No authority exisis to enact a by-law by which a Subordinate Commandery can accomplish such result without a Dispensation. (1952, P. 232, No. 15, Robert Brainerd Gaylord, G.M.) Note: Decision was amended to include Special Conclaves in accordance with amendment to Constitution in 1970. Decision No.33 [Statutes: Sections 180 and 1821 The report of the Investigating Committee of a Commandery upon a petition cannot be confined to the Commander and Recorder, but must be presented to the Commandery before the ballot is taken. (1952, p. 244, No. 26, Robert Brainerd Gaylord, G.M.) Decision No. 34 [Constitution Sections 48(f)2 and 80] Section 48(f)2 covers balloting on petitions “at the same Conclave ox Special Conclaves,” while Section 80 deals with the “same Conclave,” only. The above sections specifically provide that notice be given of balloting on petitions al the same Conclave and at all Special Conclaves. The form and content of the notice to be given is not prescribed by statute, but these matters are in the discretion of the authority granting the Dispensation. It is bettei practice foi the Dispensation to name the petitioners to be balloted upon, bul the notice of the Conclave need not contain their names unless the Dispensation so directs.

This provision, however, is not self- executing. It is to be executed under such “regulations” as the Grand Commandery may enact for Constituent Comm anderies of their several jurisdictions. In cases where Grand Cornmanderies have failed to enact such regulations, the Grand Commander, under Sections 4 8(a) and (e) of the Constitution of the Grand Encampment, has authonty to require that Recorders and Treasurers be bonded, and under Section 48(d) has authority to enforce his order so requiring.

After being constituted, a Commandery may adopt By-Laws, revise or amend the same, subject to the approval of the Grand Encampment or Grand Commandery.

CHAPTER MEMBERSHIP Decision No.41 [Statutes: Section 177] A petitioner for the Orders was elected to and received the same on the assumption that he was a member in good standing in a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons. Actually, at the time of his petition and election he had been demitted from his Royal Arch Chapter. After the receipt of the Orders it was voted to reinstate him in the Chapter, but the same apparently was not legally ac5mplished. Under this state of facts, the Grand Master held that the Companion was illegally Knighted, and the defects in the Knighting never having been cured by healing, he never became a Knight Templar.

When the Grand Commanderyis formed, it should issue Charters to all Commanderies within its territorial jurisdiction.

There is no appeal to the Commandery from such a “decision,” but such action by the Commander shall not affect the standing in the Order of sudi officer or his membership in the Commandery. Such removal may also be ordered by the Grand Commander, for the same reason and within the same limitations. The authoilty to remove an officer for non-performance of official duties rises from the broad authority of the Grand Commander and the Commander, under the vertical axis of power and authority established by Templat laws, to govem his respective level of Templar jurisdiction. Such authority, when related to the duty of seeing that Templar laws are observed, and in the absence of arbitrary conduct by the presiding officer, is practically unlimited. In the exercise of such authority, the Commander must always be concemed for the good of the Order, and such flnal step as removal of an officer should be taken as a last resort. It should be only rarely that an officer will not either respond to the needs of the office he has sworn-to perform to the best of his ability or consent to resign voluntarily. Even theh, the Commander should give written notice to the offending officer to appear at a time and place and justify his conduct, and a third member should be present at such hearing; also the Grand Commander should be informed. While the Grand Commander of the jurisdiction and the Grand Master of the Grand Encampment have similar authority with regard to all officers within their areas of command, it seems best that problems be solved where they exist and not allowed to fester while waiting for action by some higher authority. The Commander has the tools to handle matters at the local level, and he should not expect or invite outside intervention to solve his own problems.

(1937, p. 345, No. 2 part 3, Mark Norris, Acting G.M.) Decision No. 76 The law seems to be silent on the length of life of a demit, and I do not find where any decjsions have been rendered by my predecessors. A demit terminates the membership of a Knight; for as long as he carries the demit he remains unaffiliated. He does not have the right to visit a Commandery without being affdiated, in my opinion, except one time only, and that being predicated on the idea that he must establish his identity as a Knight Templar and submit the demit for affiliation. A demitted Knight Templar has no right to be carrying a demit around all over the country and visiting Commanderies without having a sustaining membership from some Constituent Commandery.

It is not a right. It is a privilege. If any objection was made to any man visiting a Commandery, he may not be allowed to visit it, except on official business. Any Grand Commandery may prescribe a law under which an unaffiliated man holding a demit may hold the demit. (1949, p. 213, No. 3b, John Temple Rice, G.M.) Decision No. 77 Grand Encampment laws are silent concerning whether a voluntarily unaffdiated (demitted) Knight Templar should be extended the privilege of visitation, although in his Decision No. 3 Grand Master Rice expressed the opinion that such privilege should not be granted indefinitely. A demitted member may be extended such pnvilege, though any member may deny it by objecting in accordance with Section 224 of the Statutes of the Grand Encampment. Regarding a Knight Templar who is involuntarily unaffiliated by reason of disciplinary action, either by expulsion or suspension, it is my decision that he not only has no “right” to be admitted, but also should not be ~zdmitted to any Templar assembly. Having been denied the privileges of membership by his Commandery, it seems obvious that these pnvileges should not be extended by any other Templar group. Further, it seems equally obvious that no Cornmandery may restore the privileges of active membeiship except the Commandery that imposed the discipline. Finally, having no membership, he may not propose any Templar action except his own restoration by regular petition to the Commandery of which he formerly was a member.

Thus, no Knight Templar has a personal “right” to visit any Commandery other than that of which he is a member, though such privilege is rarely denied to any affiliated Knight Templar.

Provisions found in the Constitu - tion and Statutes of 1910 and 1922 were carned forward without change into the 1934 revision. Such carrying forward without change constituted merely a re-enactment of the old provisions, and in all such cases rulings which have been made in reference to those re-enacted provisions would be applicable today.

Since Council membership cannot be required of this Knight Templar, neither can it be required that he continue to be an active member of a Council of Royal and Select Masters if he becomes a member after becoming a Knight Templar. If Council membership was prerequisite to Templar membership in the individual case, good standing in the Council as well as in Lodge and Chapter must support Templar membership.

Assuming that this was for the purpose of cIeating something in the similitude of life membership, he announced that such could not be done. A N Past Commanders as a class may not be thus favored. The question asked of the Grand Master seemingly had no reference to the cieation of life member - ships. It was rather directed to the point as to whether, if such remissions were possible, the Commandery itself would be liable for per capita tax upon the members whose dues were remitted. We think this question should be answered in the same way the life membership was answered.

Decision No. 218 [Statutes: Sections 147 and 177] Under the provisions of Section 147 of the Statutes of the Grand Encampment, the territorial jurisdiction of a Grand Commandery is limited to the boundaries of the country, state, territory or district in which it is located and it cannot legally extend the jurisdiction of any of its Commanderies beyond its borders; hence, it follows that any such Commandery cannot legally receive an original petition of one whose domicile is in another Grand Jurisdiction. Moreover, neither can same be legally authorized by Dispensation, since the effect of such a Dispensation would set aside Section 147, as well as other provisions of our Constitution and Statutes.

Decision No. 248 [Constitution: Section 46] If a Grand Recorder dies during his term of office, it is necessary that his successor be installed in the office to fill out the unexpired term, as every officer of a Grand Commandery must take the oath of office and be installed before entering upon the duties of his office. (1955, p. 279, No. 32-2, William Cab-on Gordon, G.M.) Decision No. 249 An officer who shows an utter lack of interest, doesn’t attend and is an example of gross negligence, may be removed from his office by the Commander following a formal “decision” by the Commander finding unknightly conduct by ieason of nonfeasance, misfeasance, and/or malfeasance in the performance of the duties of the office of the offending officer. There is no appeal to the Commandery from such a “decision,” but such action by the Commander shall not affect the standing in the Order of such officer or his membership in the Commandery. Such removal may also be ordered by the Grand Commander, for the same reason and within the same limitations. The authority to remove an officer for non-performance of official duties rises from the broad authority of the Grand Commander and the Commander, under the vertical axis of power and authority established by Templar law, to govern his respective level of Templar jurisdiction. Such authority, when related to the duty of seeing that Templar laws are observed, and in the absence of arbitrary conduct by the piesiding officer, is practically unlimited. In the exercise of such authority, the Commander must always be concerned for the good of the Order, and such final step as removal of an officer should be taken as a last resort. It should be only rarely that an officer will not either respond to the needs of the office he has sworn to perform to the best of his ability or consent to resign voluntarily. Even then, the Commander should give written notice to the offending officer to appear at a time and place and justify his conduct, and a third member should be present at such hearing; also the Grand Commander should be informed.

The North Caiohna Commandery requested information as how to proceed. The Commandery in North Carolina cannot enteitain the petition to confer the Order of Malta. The Preceptory may request the Commandery to confer the Order of Malta as a courtesy, or the petitioner may return to his Preceptory for the work. (1958, p. 269, No. 8, Walter Allen DeL amater, G.M.) Decision No. 257 The question was asked: “Has an organization called ‘The Crusaders,’ organized under the auspices of the Shrine, the legal right as such organization to confer the Orders of Knighthood in a Commandery of Knights Templar?” If a Commandery is opened m the Order of the Temple and the Commander is present, or in his absence the next duly-qualified officer is present, then the work of conferring the Order of the Temple under the supervision of such presiding officer could be conferred by any Sir Knight whom the Commandei would select, provided that any duly-elected officer replaced in the cast would consent to such arrangement. The Grand Encampment does not recognize any other orgamzation except a duly-constituted Commandery as qualified to confer the Orders of Knighthood. Consequently, no organization under the auspices of the Shrine, or any othei body which sees fit to call itself ‘The Crusadeis,’ has the legal right as such organization, without the sponsorship of a duly-constituted Commandery of Knights Templar, under the circumstances above outlined, to confer the Orders of Knighthood, nor can such organization in its own name be empowered to do so by either the Grand Commandery or the Grand Master of the Grand Encampment. Another thing to remember is, ffiat when such organization qualifies to confer ihe Orders of Knighthood, the members participating in the ritualistic work must be dressed as Knights Templar, wearing uniforms legal[zed by the Grand Commandery of that jurisdiction and the Grand Encampment of Knights Templai of the United States of America.

In subdivision (e) of said Section it is specifically provided “The decisions of the Grand Encampment are final, and no appeal lies therefrom.” The Constitution of the Grand Encampment defines the powers and duties of Grand Commanderies, names the officers thereof, designates their honorary and official titles, the precedence of rank, and piesciibes their duties specifically and generally.

F."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"91 Historical Memoranda of Former Digests Prior to the Grand Mastership of M.E. Sir William B. Hubbard (1847-1 859), there were very few decisions on Templar law published. In 1854 Grand Master Hubbard published a digest of his decisions up to 1853. Since then other digests have been published, each endeavoring to bring up to date the rulings on Templar law. The decisions of Grand Masters Hubbard (1847-1859), French (1 859-1865), Palmer (1865.1868), Gardnei (1868-1871), are compiled in the Appendix to the Proceedings of 1871. In 1871 a committee was appointed to compile a digest of all published decisions of the Grand Encampment and of its Grand Masters. In 1874 this committee, instead of reporting a digest of decisions, presented a code of statutes manifestly based upon the decisions of previous Grand Masters. This was a code reduced to statutes of Templar law. It was not a digest. (See 1874, Appendix.) This code was adopted and in 1883 a supplement to the above covering 1874, 1877, 1880 and 1883 was made in the form of a digest by Josiah H. Drummond of Maine. (1883 Appendix; 1886 Appendix republished; 1889 republished.) In 1898 the Grand Encampment adopted a complete revision of its Constitu - tion, code of statutes, etc. (See 1898 Appendix.) In 1910 the Grand Encampment adopted a new Constitution and Laws, comprising three hundred and eleven sections, and repealed all laws theretofoxe enacted and not re-enacted. (1910 Appendix.) This included disciplinary rules, installations, and other forms. In 1919 Appendix, there was published in the Proceedings an index of the decisions of Grand Masters Melish, MacArthur and Smith, and in 1922 a similar index was published in the decisions of Grand Master Orr. (1922 Appendix.) None of these indices were digests. They were simply indexes, in no way stating the point decided. In 1923 Past Grand Master Newby published a Digest of Decisions rendered since 1910. Grand Master Newby took the position that all previous laws and decisions had been totally repealed, and therefore he digested only the decisions from 1910 to 1922. The assumption made by Grand Master Newby was not well founded. Many of the provisions in the new code adopted in 1910 were simply taken bodily from the previously enacted law and were re-enacted in the new"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"92 HISTORICAL MEMORANDA code. The construction and the rulings on those provisions which continued in the new code unaltered still prevailed, and they have continued in the Templar laws ever since. In 1934 the Grand Encampment completely revised the Constitution and enacted that “all statutes, laws and regulations heretofore enacted, adopted or approved in conflict herewilh are hereby repealed.” In 1941 Sir Knight Fred C. Wright of St. Paul, Minnesota, then Grand Senior Warden of the Grand Commandery of Minnesota, prepared a Digest of Decisions from 1910 up to and including 1940. After completion of his term of office as Grand Master, Sir Knight Mark Norris, recognizing a need for a complete Digest of the approved Oecisions of the Grand Masters, together with the history of the Constitution and its changes and development, started extensive research into such a compilation. Unfoi tu - nately, in 1942 he was stricken with illness pnor to completing and shaping the material into any definite form. In 1945 Sir Knight Charles N. Orr, Most Eminent Grand Master, delegated to Sir Knight Jewel P. Lightfoot, Pasi Grand Commander of Texas and member of the Commiltee on Templar Jurisprudence of the Grand Encampment, the responsibility for this Digesi. It was completed October 1,1946. Dunng the term of Grand Master Roy Wilford Riegle, an official request was relayed to Sir Knight Harrison C. Hartline, Past Grand Commander of the Grand Commandery of Pennsylvania, to review the earlier work for updating. The listings of Decisions made since Sir Knight Lightfoot’s Digest of 1946 were placed in his hands for preparation and were then reviewed by Sir Knight Herbert D. Sledd, Chairman of the Grand Encampment Committee on Templar Jurisprudence. The project was completed May 2, 1977. The present work includes a rearrangemeni of all the important decisions of the Grand Encampment still believed to be applicable. 93 EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION In 1922 the Grand Encampment launched the Knights Templar Educational Foundation with these words: “We feel that the Grand Encampment can build no greater monument nor inauguiate a more worth-while movement than to put into effect a plan which will provide educational advantages for the youth of our beloved Country, thereby enabling them to become more useful members of society and better citizens of this Republic.” Knights Teinplar may be proud that we were the first fraternal order to esiablish a program to assist needy young men and women to complete a higher education. The money was raised by transferring $100,000.00 from our Permanent Fund, augmented by a levy upon each Knight Templar of one dollar per year for nine years. Loans have been made to individual students in the amount of over $25 million. The Foundation maintains a revolving fund of approximately $5.5 million, invested in student loans to the extent of approxi - mately 80 percent. This proud record will stand up favorably when compared with any similar project anywhere. The Knights Templar Educational Foundation publishes its general rules in a pamphlet called “Regulations and Standard Practice.” Among these — (I) “Loans may be granted for vocational, professional training, advanced degree or post graduate work upon written approval of the majority of the Division (State) Committee; (2) the maximum loan will be $1,500.00 when one scholastic year is required to complete the course, $1,500 per year when two scholastic years are required to complete the course, a maximum of $3,000 to any one student; (3) loans shall be evidenced by a negotiable note and agreement for the amount loaned bearing interest at the minimum rate of 5% per annum from a time not later than the date of graduation or leaving college; (4) each applicant shall be carefully and thoroughly investigated by the Committee or Constituent Commandery Committee; (5) minimum repayments shall be 10% during the fist year after the date of graduation, 20% during the second year, 30% during the third year, and 40% during the fourth year.” The Grand Encampment Committee says “It is recommended and urged that each Constituent Commandery appoint a committee of not less than three from its membership, for the purpose of acting in a liaison capacity between the State Committee and the local Commandery. This committee should cooperate in all matters pertaining to the Foundation in their community. They should publicize the policies of the Foundation, Furnish information on eligibility of applicants, and assist in making investigations.” To this official language, we would add these practical suggestions: Fr I ‘~1"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"94 EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION The local committee should be composed of members who have active and sympathetic contacts with young people within the Commandery jurisdiction, especially with DeMolay and other Masonic related groups. Information should go to school officials, our own members, and other Masonic bodies. the local committee should have in hand the basic application form and be ready to assist any worthy student in its preparation, and to make at the same time such primary local investigation as might be desired by the State Committee, thus expediting the loan process. In the event that repayment might later become delinquent, the local committee should assist the Division Committee as might be useful. The Grand Encampment prints a “Guidelines for Making Student Loans” which is available without charge upon request from the Grand Recorder’s office, Chicago. Much remains to be done to publicize our Knights Teinplar Educational Foundation and to make its b&nefits known to institutions and to the public. The main thrust in this direction must come from the membership itself. Each Templar should become acquainted with the procedures for securing loans so that he is in a bettei position to answer questions and to refer reputable applica - tions. The local Recorder is in the best position to fuinish information. If more details are needed, write to the Chairman of the Committee on the Educational Foundation or to the office of the Grand Recorder of the Grand Encampment. (As of May 2, 1977) (From “The New Charting the Course.” a publication of the Grand Encampment.) I ‘1 95 EYE FOUNDATION A genuine concern for the needs of others is one of the basic characteristics of Templary — being Christian in nature, and stemming from the ancient Hospitallers or Knights of Malta. First in importance and national in scope is the Knights Templar Eye Foundation, Inc. This great project represents every Knight Templar of the United States and requires his attention and under - standing. (a) History and Operation of the K. T. Eye Foundation, Inc. The Knights Templar Eye Foundation, Inc., was founded by action taken at the Triennial Conclave of 1955 and the organization was Formed in 1957. The management of the Foundation is in the hands of its Board of Trustees. The Administration oF the Eye Foundation is in the hands of the Executive Director. Each Grand Commandery should have an active, wide-awake and alert Eye Foundation Committee work with the Executive Director. Each Constituent Commandery should also have a vigoious committee to work with the state committee and with Ihe Executive Director. No paid solicitors have ever been employed. All funds are raised by voluntary contributions and the contributions received from contributing and cooperating Divisions — together with an annual assessment of each Knight Templar. No salaries are paid to anyone, except the necessary staff in the national office. No funds are used for the construction of hospital facilities. Hence, nearly all funds received are available for research or surgery. All contributions are tax- deductible. The Knights Templar Eye Foundation may be justly designated as one of the world’s greatest humanilarian projects. Money has been allocated to research in college and university laboratories for the study of diseases causing blindness. Many thousands of cases have been processed. Millions have been expended for surgical and hospital expenses. Such figures as these lack substance until we remember that each of these thousands was a person — a fellow human — who lacked both personal resources and access to any publicly supported program which would enable him to have the surgical treatment to ward off or correct the actual condition of blindness, which has been certified by a medical specialist. Our files are full of testimonial letters, in every one of which the person brought from darkness to light by our efforts has expressed his glowing appreciation to God and His Christian Knights for their generous assistance. Surely this is doing the work of the Master. (b) There should be a K. T. Eye Foundation Committee in every Commandery. There should be within each Commnandery a special K.T. Eye Foundation Committee composed of interested and dedicated Knights Templar. Such a I I"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"96 EYE FOUNDATION Committee is necessary for two reasons, (1) the Knights~ Templar Eye Founda - tion, already a proud success, may continue to grow and may touch persons in every community, and (2) Templars in every Commandery may experience the joy of useful service on a person-to-person basis which is always much more satisfactory than the simple contribution of money. (c) Committee Functions. 1. To become informed. Full information on the operation of the K.T. Eye Foundation, in the form of brochures, etc., should be obtained through the Grand Commandery Committee. A set of forms should be obtained from the Grand Commandery Committee so that application may be forwarded with all dispatch. 2 To inform others. Our own Knights Templar should know the facts about what we have done and what we stand ready to do for persons without personal resources who face blindness. Doctors, surgeons and especially Ophthalmologists in every city, town and hamlet in the country should be informed by the Knights Templar and kept informed aboul the progress of our great charity. Where committees have been most active, they have appeaied on scoies of occasions before Blue Lodges and other Masonic bodies within their jurisdiction, before service clubs, professional societies, church organizations, industnal and business organizations. From this activity comes not only the reference of patients, but due recognition of the magnificent contribution being made by Templary. 3. To assist those in need. The application forms are not complicated; neither is the procedure. However, it is best thai the forms be on hand and fully understood, as certain information is essential and iS 10 be verified so that we can be sure that ihe need for our assistance is real and within our limitations. It is best that the forms be completed with the assistance of the local committee - man, who then, as the Knight Templar sponsor, may quickly satisfy himself that the incidental statements aie true and that recourse to public assistance is not available. Not only is handling of the case expedited, but the personal participation of the commnitteeman shows the applicant, as well as the public, that we handle these cases with promptness and dispatch. 4. To assist in raising funds. The local committee should see that tlie persons and organizations who might wish to help the Ki. Eye Foundation are fully informed about the work. We receive additional contributions from: (a) Voluntary contributions and memorial gifts. Many of our members have means and the habit of giving — a letter to every member or a reminder in the Commandery bulletin will be ievealing. In many places, members habitually contribute as a memorial to deceased Templars. The solicitation of such memorials as a Commandery project, within its DIGEST OF DECISIONS membership, might well be a part of the memorial service if conducted separately, or at the next Conclave or in the next bulletin. Acknowledg- ment receipts are sent from the Eye Foundation for all contributions. (b) Wills and bequests. Many persons, both within and outside Templary, are financially able and charitably inclined. They need to be told about the Knights Templar Eye Foundation so that at the appropriale time they may include our projeci in their Will. Certainly, every attoiney and banker within our jurisdiction should be informed, together with all who might be inclined to iecommend the K.T. Eye Foundation at tlie right time. No one can realize how much it means to drop a good word at Ihe right time so that the individual may remember the K.T. Eye Foundation in his Will. (c) Life Sponsors. Any Knight Templar may become a Life Sponsor of the Eye Foundation upon a single payment of $30.00. A Life Sponsor card goes to the member together with a receipt, and he is relieved from the annual assessment. Two copies of the receipt go to the Grand Recorder one of which is forwarded to the Commandery, so that appropriate record may be made. Many Knights Templar are now Life Sponsors — many more would result if all could be informed. (d) Patrons and Associate Patrons. Any individual not a member, or any small organization, whethei Masonic or not, may join by contributions. A single donation of $100, or more, entitles the individual or orgamzation to classification as a Patron of the Eye Foundation, and $50, or more, qualifies him or them as an Associate Patron, and a suitable cerlificate is sent in recognition of the gift. Members, too, may become Patrons or Associate Patrons which also relieves them of the annual assessment. (e) Grand and Coordinate bodies participation. Our first full endorsement came from the Social Order of the Beauceant, which has associated with us for several years and has contrmbuted hundreds of thousands of dollars to our funds. Such support shows how others throughout the country view the importance of our great humanitarian project. (I) Commandery fund raising. In recognition of the obvious fact that those things done officially by our Commanderies need little supervision, local Commanderies are now permitted to raise money for the Knights Templar Eye Foundation by any or all usually accepted methods, providing only that (1) the decision to hold a particular program is made in a regular Conclave of the Commandery, and (2) and 100% of the net receipts are forwarded to the Eye Foundation office within thirty days afterward. (g) Voluntary Activities Campaign. Each year, for a specified period, all Commanderies are asked to cooperate in a special drive to raise money for the Eye Foundation. Emphasis is placed on fund-raising activities rather F 97"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"EYE FOUNDATION than personal contributions. Special recognition is given by the Grand Encampment to Grand, Constituent and Subordinate Commanderies reaching a specified level of participation. The Grand Encampment feels that the Knights Templar Eye Foundation is doing such an outstanding job for humainty that every Knight Templar ought to become an enthusiastic booster. We ought to be talking to our friends moie often about its wonderful work. Truly this is the work of our Savior.
