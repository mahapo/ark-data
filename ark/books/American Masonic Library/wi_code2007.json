[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" THE MASONIC CODE OF WISCONSIN Adopted by the Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Masons of Wisconsin  WIGL-008-Rev. August 007"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 PREFACE At the first “Grand Communication of the Grand Lodge of Wiscons in, begun and holden at the city of Madison, on Monday the 18th day of December, A. D. 1843, A. L. 5843,” a constitution and a code of bylaws was adopted for the government of the Craft. A constitution in pamphlet form appeared in the year 1869 unde r the title “Constitution of the M. W. Grand Lodge Free and Acce pted Masons of the State of Wisconsin.” This revisi on was adopted June 9, A. D. 1869, A. L. 5869. Between 1869 and 1897 amendments to and revi sions of the Constitution were made, and in several instances the Constitution was ordered incorporated in and printed with the Proceedings. A complete revision was adopted at the a nnual communication of Grand Lodge held in June 1897, A. L. 5897, under the title of “Constitution Law and Edicts of the Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Wisconsin.” The Landmarks, or the Unwr itten Law, by Albert G. Mackey were ordered published with th is revised edition for the in formation of the Brethren. A codification of the Constitution was directed by the Gr and Lodge in 1906. The Committee continued through 1907 and 1908 a re vision was adopted with which there was published a Trial Code, Approved Decisions of Grand Ma sters, Forms For Use of Lodges and The Foundations of Masonic Law. By resolution adopted June 9, 1920, a committee was appointed a nd directed to compile and incorporate with the 1908 edition al l amendments and addi tions thereto and republish the same. A Committee on Revision was appointed in 1937. The Committee pr esented its report at the 1939 annual communication, which repo rt, with some alterations and amendm ents, was adopted on June 12, 1940, A. L. 5940. It was named “Mas onic Code of Wisconsin.” The 1 940 Code superseded the 1908 editio n as compiled, amended and republished in the year 1920. In the fall of the year 1950, with a ten year accumulation of amendments and Grand Masters’ Decisions, a Committee on Code Rev ision was appointed. The Committee set itself to the task of revising th e Code with certain controlling ideas in view. Two courses of action were presented. First: To republish the 1940 revised edition by adding thereto only the enactments of Grand Lodge since the adoption of the 19 40 Code, including both the changes and additions. Seco nd: To make a revision, seeking to improve , if possible, the form as well as the substance of our Masonic Law, eliminating such matters as seem to be contradictor y and classify as to relative importance the several parts of t he Code. The Committee chose the latter course. It sought with utmost care to publish a Code of laws worthy of the fraternity. This Revised Edition of the Masonic Code of Wisconsin was adopt ed by the Grand Lodge F. & A.M. of Wisconsin at the Annual Communication held on the 9th day of June A. D. 1954, A. L. 5954, and superseded the edition known as the1940 Code. In 1966, A. L. 5966, a Committee on Revision of the Masonic Code was appointed by Grand Master W illiam J. Kahlenberg to “bring our 1954 Code Revision up to date, to correct the conflictions and errata , to revamp the index to a more useful structure, recommen d and introduce such legislation to the Grand Lodge as may be necessary to clarify and eliminate conflictions and, finally, to produce for the Grand Lodge a loose-leaf printed revision.” It was anticipated that this woul d require two years of effort. Norman H. Smith, P.G.M., Chairman ; Orrin H. Larrabee, P.G.M.; Lewis A. Stocki ng, P.G.M.; Charles E. White, then J.G.D. and Eu gene G. Williams labored for a year; then Orri n H. Larrabee, P.G.M., Chairman; William J. Kahlenberg, P.G.M.; Charles E. White , then S.G.D.; James L. Stocking and Eugene G. Williams contin ued the work and the Grand Lodge on June 14, A. D. 1967, A. L. 5967, adopted a new Masonic C ode, repealing the old Code, and authorized printing a loose-leaf Code to contain a new numbering system, the inclusion of certain Statute La w relating to Masonry, changing certain p arts of the previous Laws to be placed in the Appendix, the preparation of a comprehensive index and bringing the Annotations up to date. G rateful recognition is also given to Past Grand Mast er Willard S. Griswold who assisted in codifying the then law and the earlier “Anno tations.” The loose-leaf Masonic Code of Wisconsin was completely reprin ted in 1972. Annually, new pages we re printed as changes were ma de in Grand Lodge Communications of 1973 through 1980. The current 8-1/2 x 11 inch loose leaf format was adopted in 1981. Since then it has been updat ed annually by replacing or add ing pages as necessary. The entire code was revi ewed by the Code Revision Committee duri ng fiscal 1995-1996 and a thorough updating, incl uding computerizing, in accordance with the current practices, was accomplished and approved by the annual communication on June 11, 1996. In 2004 the entire Wisconsin Code was again reviewed by the C ode Revision Committee, consisting of Archie E. Simonson, George A. Wallinger, PGM, PGS; James H. Olson, PGM; Br uce S. Sim, PGM, PGS; and Michael A. DeWolf, PGM, GS. Up-dates and corrections wer e made. The Code was converted to MS-Word and Adobe PDF to allo w publication on the Grand Lodge of Wisconsin Web Page. For the first time the Code was published and di stributed in a CD-Rom format. In 2006 & 2007 the Wisconsin Code was revised to reflect the revi sions passed at the respective Annual Communications by Grand Secretary Michael A. DeWolf, PGM. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 THE NUMBERING SYSTEM The Index refers you to section numbers. Certain of these section numbers relate to sections of th e Wisconsin Statutes. Other s relate to the Constitution and Laws of the Grand Lodge, Regulations for Lodges and the Trial Code. The chapter number (or article number for the Constitution) is to the left of the decimal point, and the sect ion number to the right. 6.01 means Article 6 of the Constituti on, Section No. 1. With the decimal system it is possible to insert new sections in their proper place. If it is ne cessary to put a new section be tween 6.01 and 6.02, the new section can be numbered 6.011. This is because in the decimal system 6.01 is the same as 6.010, a nd 6.02 the same as 6 .020. Thus 6.011 comes in between 6.01 and 6.02. This system is basically that used by the Wisconsin Statutes. Page numbers shown in the Table of Cont ents are at the bottom of the pages."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 TABLE OF CONTENTS CONSTITUTION OF THE GRAND LODGE Articles 1 to 20 Article Subject Page

We have also tried to expand and clarify the Index, so t hat one not too learned in the Law may find his way among the several segments of this book. May we add a word of admonition, however, to those who think that by knowing what is in this book that they are now in possession of the secrets of Masonry. T hese are written Laws anyone can read. The true Mason learns in his heart, by precept and example and the lessons taught in the degrees, learns Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth; learns of Hope, Lo ve and Charity; learns of the Brotherhood of Man and the Fatherhood of God; in other words, lear ns of the spirit, not the legalism or the trappings of Masonry. These laws, these Rules, this Constitution, these writings all are but a staff to help a sincere and devoted Mason know the rules so that he can devote himself to his true task, to stand upright before God and man as a just and upright Mason, and may each of us ever walk and act as such.

I. Concerning God and Religion A Mason is oblig’d, by his Tenure, to obey the mora l Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancient Times, Masons were charg’d in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves; that is, to be good Men and true or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Deno minations or Persuasions they may be distinguish’d; whereby Masonry becomes the Center of Union and the means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remain’d at a perpetual Distance. II. Of the Civil Magistrate Supreme and Subordinate A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers , wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concern’d in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and We lfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior Magistrates; for as Masonry hath been always in jured by War, Bloodshed, and Confusion, so ancient Kings and Princes have been much dispos’d to encourage the Craf tsmen, because of their Peaceableness and Loyalty whereby they practically answer’d the Cavils of their Adversaries, and prom oted the Honour of the Fraternity, who ever flourish’d in Times of Peace. So that if a Br other should be a Rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanc’d in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy Man; and, if convicted of no other Crime, though the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political jealousy to the Government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his Relation to it remains indefeasible. III. Of Lodges A Lodge is a Place where Masons assemble and work: Hence that Assembly, or duly organiz’d Society of Masons, is call’d a Lodge, and every Brother ought to bel ong to one, and to be subject to its By-Laws and the General Regulations. It is either particular or genera l, and will be best understood by attending it, and by the Regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annex’d. In ancient Times no Master or Fellow could be absent from it, especially when warn’d to appear at it, without in curring a severe Censure, until it appear’d to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hinder’d him. The persons admitted Members of a Lodge must be good and true Men, freeborn, and of mature and discreet Age, no Bondmen, no Women, no immo ral or scandalous Men, but of good Report."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 APPENDIX THE CHARGES OF A FREE-MASON IV. Of Masters, Wardens, Fellows, and Apprentices All Preferment among Masons is grounded upon real Wo rth and personal Merit only; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to Shame, nor the Ro yal Craft despis’d: Therefore no Master or Warden is chosen by Seniority, but for his Merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every Brother must attend in his Place, and learn them in a way peculiar to th is Fraternity: Only Candidates may know, that no Master should take an Apprentice, unless he has sufficient empl oyment for him, and unless he be a perfect Youth, having no Maim or Defect in his Body, that may render him incapabl e of learning the Art, of serv ing his Master’s Lord, and of being made a Brother, and then a Fellowcraft in due time, even after he has served such a Term of years as the Custom of the Country directs; and that he should be descended of honest Parents; that so, when otherwise qualify’d, he made arrive to the Honour of being the War den, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand-Master of all the Lodges, according to his Merit. No Brother can be a Warden until he ha s pass’d the part of a Fellowcraft; nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand Warden until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor Grand Master unless he has been a Fellowcraft, before his Election, who is also to be nobly born, or a Gentleman of the best Fashion, or some eminent Scholar, or some curious Architect, or other Artist, descended of honest Parents, and who is of singular great Merit in the Opinion of the Lodges. And for the better, and easier , and more honourable Discharge of his Office, the Grand Master has a Power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular Lodge, and has the Privilege of ac ting whatever the Grand Master, his Principal, should act, unless the said Principal be present, or interpose his Authority by a Letter. These Rulers and Governors, supreme and subordinate, of the ancient Lodge, are to be obey’d in their respective Stations by all the Brethren, according to the old Charges and Regul ations, with all Humility, Reverence, Love and Alacrity. V. Of the Management of the Craft in Working All Masons shall work honestly on working Days, that they may live creditably on holy Days; and the time appointed by the Law of the Land, or conf irm’d by Custom, shall be observ’d. The most expert of the Fellowcraftsmen shall be chos en or appointed the Master, or Overseer of the Lord’s Work; who is to be call’d Master by those that work u nder him. The Craftsmen are to avoid all ill Language, and to call each other by no disobliging Name, but Brother or Fellow; and to behave themselves courteously within and without the Lodge. The Master, knowing himself to be able of Cunning, shall undertake the Lord’s Work as reasonably as possible, and truly dispend his Goods as if they were his ow n; nor to give more Wages to any Brother or Apprentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons receiving their Wages ju stly, shall be faithful to the Lord, and honestly finish their Work, whether Task or Journey; nor put the Wo rk to Task that hath been accustom’d to Journey. None shall discover Envy at the prosperity of a Brother , nor supplant him, or put him out of his Work, if he be capable to finish the same; for no Man can finish another’s Work so much to the Lord’s Profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the Design s and Draughts of him that began it. When a Fellowcraftsman is chosen Warden of the Work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fellows, shall carefully oversee the Work in the Mast er’s Absence to the Lord’s Profit; and his Brethren shall obey him. All Masons employ’d shall meekly receive their Wages without Murmuring or Mutiny, and not desert the Master till the Work is finish’d. A younger Brother shall be instructed in working, to prevent spoiling the Materials for want of Judgment and for increasing and continuing of Brotherly Love. All the Tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge. No Labourer shall be employ’d in the proper Work of Masonry; nor shall Free Masons work with those that are not free, without an urgent Necessit y; nor shall they teach Labourers and unaccepted Masons, as they should teach a Brother or Fellow."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 APPENDIX THE CHARGES OF A FREE-MASON VI. Of Behaviour, Viz.: 1. In the Lodge While Constituted You are not to hold private Committees, or separate Conv ersation, without Leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinent or unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any Brother speaking to the Master: Nor behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn; nor use any unbecoming Language upon any Pretence whatsoever; but to pay due Reverence to your Master, Wardens, and Fellows, and put them to worship. If any Complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the Award and Determination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent Judges of all such Controversies, (unless you carry it by Appeal to the Grand Lodge) and to whom they ought to be referr’d, unles s a Lord’s Work be hinder’d the mean while, in which Case a particular Reference may be made; but you must nev er go to Law about what concerneth Masonry, without an absolute Necessity apparent to the Lodge. 2. Behaviour After the Lodge is O ver and the Brethren Not Gone You may enjoy yourselves with innocent Mirth, tr eating one another according to Ability, but avoiding all Excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his Inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occasions call him, or doing or saying any thing offensive, or that may forbid an easy and free Conversation; for that would blast our Harmony, and defeat our laudable Purposes. Therefore no private Piques or Quarrels must be brought within the Door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about Religion, or Na tions, or State Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholick Religion above-mention’d; we are also of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds, and Languages, and are resolv’d against all Politicks, as what never yet conduc’d to the We lfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This Charge has been always strictly enjoin’d and observ’d; but especially ev er since the Reformation in Britain, or the Dissent and Secession of these Nations from the Communion of Rome. 3. Behaviour when Brethren Meet Wit hout Strangers, but Not in a Lodge Form’d You are to salute one another in a courteous manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freely giving mutual Instruction as shall be thought expedient, without being overse en or overheard, and without encroaching upon each other, or derogating from that Respec t which is due to any Brother, were he not a Mason: For though all Masons are as Brethren upon the same Level, yet Masonry takes no Honour from a Man that he has had before; may rather it adds to his Honour, especially if he has deserv’d well of t he Brotherhood, who must give Honour to whom it is due, and avoid ill Manners. 4. Behaviour in Presence of Strangers Not Masons You shall be cautious in your Words and Carriage, that the most penetrating Stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and sometimes you shall divert a Discourse, and manage it prudently for the Honour of t he worshipful Fraternity. 5. Behaviour at Home and in Your Neighborhood You are to act as becomes a moral and wise Man; particularly, not to let your Family, Friends, and Neighbours know the Concerns of the Lodge, &c, but wisely to consult your own Honour, and that of the ancient Brotherhood, for reasons not to be mention’d here. You must also consult your Health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from home, after Lodge Hours are past; and by avoiding of Gluttony or Drunkenness, that your Families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 APPENDIX THE CHARGES OF A FREE-MASON 6. Behavior Towards a Strange Brother You are cautiously to examine him, in such a Method as Prudence shall direct you, that you may not be impos’d upon by an ignorant false Pretender, whom you are to reject with Contempt and Derision, and beware of giving him any Hints of Knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be reliev’d: You must employ him some Days, or else recommend him to be employ’d. But you are not charged to do beyond our Ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, that is a Good Man and true, before any other poor People in the same circumstances. Finally, All these Charges you are to observe, and al so those that shall be communicated to you in another way; cultivating Brotherly-Love, the Fo undation and Capestone, the Cement a nd Glory of this ancient Fraternity, avoiding all Wrangling and Quarrelling, all Slander and Backbiting, nor permitting others to slander any honest Brother, but defending his Character, and doing him all good O ffices, as far as is consistent with your Honour and Safety, and no farther. And if any of them do you injury, you must apply to your own or his Lodge; and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge at the Quarterly Co mmunication, and from thence to the annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable Conduct of our Forefathers in every Nation; never taking a legal Course but when the Case can not be otherwise decided, and patiently list ening to the honest and friendly Advice of Master and Fellows, when they would prevent your going to Law with Str angers, or would excite you to put a speedy Period to all Law Suits, that so you may mind the Affair of Masonry wi th the more Alacrity and Success; but with respect to Brothers or Fellows at Law, the Master and Brethren should kindly offer their M ediation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the contending Brethren; and if that Submission is impracticabl e, they must however carry on their Process, or Law Suit, without Wrath or Rancor (not in the common way) saying or doing nothing which may hinder Brotherly Love, and good Offices to be renew’d and con-tinu’d; that all may see the benign Influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the Beginning of the World, and will do to the end of Time. Amen So Mote It Be. The origin of The Charges of a Free-Mason is found in the following extracts from the second (1738) Edition of Rev. James Anderson’s Constitutions: 29 Sept. 1721 — “His Grace’s Worship (Duke of Montagu) and the Lodge (Grand Lodge of England) finding fault with all the Copies of the old Gothic Constitutions, order’d Brother James Anderson, A. M., to digest the same in a new and better Method.” 27 Dec. 1721 — “Montagu, Grand Master, at the De sire of the Lodge, appoint ed 14 learned Brothers to examine Brother Anderson’s Manu script, and to make Report.” 25 March, 1722 — “The said Committee of 14 repo rted that they had perused Brother Anderson’s Manuscript, viz., the History, Charges, Regulations and Master Song, and after some Amendments has approv’d of it: Upon which the Lodge desir’d the Grand Master to order it to be print’d.” 12 January, 1723 — “G. Warden Anderson produced the new book of Constitutions now in Print, which was again approv’d, with the addition of the ancient Manner of Constituting a Lodge.” These Charges herein printed as they appear in Rev. James Anderson’s ‘Constitutions’ (1723 Edition), have always been held in the highest venerat ion by the Craft, as embodying the mo st important points of the ancient Written as well as Unwritten Law of Masonry. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 APPENDIX Part 6 LANDMARKS THE FOUNDATIONS OF MASONIC LAW The Ancient Landmarks have been controversially debated since the beginning of organized Masonry and no full agreement has yet been reached on just how many Landmarks there are and which ones are the basis of our unwritten laws. Nevertheless, the Landma rks are universally recognized as the fundamental laws of the fraternity and they are generally held to be universally unalterable and unrepealable. They have been so intimately woven into the fabric of Masonry that no one may detract from them or do anything else but to live by and obey them. Some Grand Jurisdictions have adopted the twenty-five Landmarks of Albert G. Mackey, others more and others less. We in Wisconsin have never officially adopted any of the Landmarks but we do say in our Constitution of the Grand Lodge that we are the suprem e Masonic authority in the State of Wi sconsin subject only to the Ancient Landmarks. In recent years students of Masoni c jurisprudence have given considerable weight to the Ancient Landmarks as defined by Roscoe Pound, Past Honorary Grand Mast er of the Grand Lodge of Nebraska, Past Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts and Dean of Harvard Law School. We present in this revised edition of the Masonic Code of the Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Masons of Wisconsin the Ancient Landmarks ac cording to both Mackey and Pound. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 THE LANDMARKS, OR THE UNWRITTEN LAW By Albert G. Mackey Sir William Blackstone commences his Commentaries on the Laws of Englan d with the succin ct definition, that “law, in its most general and comprehensive sense, signif ies a rule of action, and is applied to all kinds of action, whether animate or inanimate, rational or irrational.” It is in this sense that we speak of the laws of a country as being those rules, whether derived from positive enactment of the legislative authority, or from long-established custom, by which the conduct of its citizens or subjects is regulated. So, too, societies, which are but empires, kingdoms, or republics in miniature, are also controlled by rules of action which are, to their respective members, as perfect la ws as the statutes of the realm. And hence Freemasonry, as the most ancient and universal of all societies, is governed by its laws or rules of action, which either spring out of its organization, and are based upon its long establis hed customs and usages, or which are derived from the enactment of its superintending tribunals. This difference In the origin of the Laws of Masonr y leads to a threefold division of them, as follows:  1. Landmarks  2. General Regulations  3. Local Regulations  The writers on municipal law have made a division of all laws into unwritten and written — the “leges non- scriptae”and “leges scriptae.” 1 Applying these terms to the threefold divisi on of Masonic Law, we should say that the unwritten laws or customs of Masonry constitute its Landmar ks, and that the written law is to be obtained in the regulations made by the supreme Masonic authority, and which are either general or local, as the authority which enacted them was either general or local in its character. Of the nature of the Landmarks of Masonry, ther e has been some diversity of opinion among writers; 2 but perhaps the safest method is to restrict them to those ancient, and therefore universal customs of the Craft, which either gradually grew into operation as rules of action , or if at once enacted by any competent authority; were enacted at a period so remote, that no account of their orig in is to be found in the records of history. Both the enactors and the time of the enactment have passed away from the record, and the Landmarks are therefore “of higher antiquity than memory or history can reach.” The first requisite, therefore, of a custom or rule of action to constitute it a Landmark is, that it must have existed from “time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary. 3 Its antiquity is its essential element. Were it possible for all the Masonic authorities at the pres ent day to unite in a universal congress, and with the most perfect unanimity to adopt any new regulation, although such regulation would, so long as it remained unrepealed, be obligatory on the whole Craft, yet it woul d not be a Landmark. It would have the c haracter of universality, it is true, but it would be wanting in that of antiquity. Another peculiarity of these Landmarks of Masonry is, t hat they are unrepealable. As the congress to which I have just alluded would not have the power to enact a Landmark, so neither would it have the prerogative of abolishing one. The Landmarks of the Craft, like the laws of the Medes and the Persia ns, can suffer no change. What they were centuries ago, they still remain, and must so continue in force until Masonry itself shall cease to exist. 1 Blackstone defines the “unwritten laws” as those whose “original instit ution and authority are not set down in writing, as acts of parliament are, but receive their binding power and the force of laws by long and immemorial usage, and by their univers al reception throughout the kingdom.” And he defines the “written laws” to be the “statutes, acts or edicts made by and with the advice and c onsent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in parlia ment assembled.” — Comment, Introd., §3. The civil law of the Romans made a sim ilar distinction into the “jus scriptum” and the “jus nonscripture,” the latter or un written law being also called the “jus moribus constitutum,” or the law rounded on “consuetudo inveterata,” or imme morial custom. The Hebrews, too, had their double set of la ws, the written, which are found in the Pentateuch, and the oral, said to have been given by God to Moses, to be by him orally communicated to Aaron and the elders, an d thence traditionally handed down to future generations. 2 ”With respect to the Landmarks of Masonry, some restrict them to the O. B., signs, tokens and words. Others include the ceremon ies of initiation, passing and raising; and the form, dimensions and supports ; the ground, situation and covering; th e ornaments, furniture and jewels of a Lo dge, or their characteristic symbols. Some think that the Craft has no Landmarks beyond its peculiar se crets.” — Oliver, Diet. Symb. Ma s. All these are loose and uns atisfactory definitions, excluding things that are essential, and admitting others that are non-essential. 3 Blackstone says, (Introd. §3) “the goodness of a custom depends upon its having been used time out of mind; or in the solemnity of our legal phrase, time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contra ry. This it is that gives it its weight and authority.” All this may be applied in t he precise terms to the Landmarks of Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 MACKEY’S LANDMARKS It is fortunate for the stability of Masonry, that Landmar ks so unchangeable should exist; they stand in the way of innovations controlling and checking them, 4 and if sometimes inadvertently vi olated, are ever bringing the reflective and conscientious Mason back again under their influence, and preserving that general uniformity of character and design which constitutes the true universality of the institution. But it is equally fortunate for the prosperity of the Craft, and fo r its capacity of k eeping up with the progress of the age, that these Landmarks are few in number. They are sufficiently numerous to act as bulwar ks against innovations, but not sufficient to stand in the way of needful reform 5 The Landmarks of Masonry, so far as I have been enabled to compute them, after the most careful examination, amount only to twenty-five in number, and are as follows: Landmark First The modes of recognition are, of all the Landmarks, the most legitimate and unquestioned. 6 They admit of no variation; and if ever they have suffered alteration or addi tion, the evil of such a violation of the ancient law has always made itself subsequently manifest. An admission of th is is to be found in the proceedings of the late Masonic Congress at Paris, where a proposition was presented to render these modes of recognition once more universal 7 a proposition which never would have been necessary, if the integrity of this important Landmark had been rigorously preserved. Landmark Second The division of symbolic Masonry into three degrees, 8 is a Landmark that has been better preserved than almost any other, although even here the mischievou s spirit of innovation has left its traces, and by the disruption of its concluding portion from the third degree, 9 a want of uniformity has been created in respect to the final teaching of the Master’s degree; and the Royal Arch of England, Scotl and, Ireland and America, and the “high degrees” of France and Germany, are all made to differ in the mode in which they lead the neophyte to the great consummation of all symbolic Masonry. 10 In 1813, the Grand Lodge of England vindicated the ancient Landmark, by solemnly enacting that Ancient Craft Masonry consisted of the three degrees of Entered Appr entice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, including the Holy Royal Arch. 11 But the disruption has never been healed, and the Landmark, although acknowledged in its integrity by a ll, still continues to be violated. 4 ”The preservation of the ancient customs is a very considerable point in respect to manners. Since a corrupt people seldom perf orm any memorable actions, seldom establish societies, build cities or enact laws; on the contrary, since most institut ions are derived from people of simple or severe morals; to recall men to the ancient maxims is generally recalling them to virtue. ” — Montesquiei Spirit of Laws, V. vii. 5 ”The fundamental principles of Freemasonry are, it is true, the same now that they were in the very beginning of the institutio n, and must always continue the same. And yet there can be no doubt that, like every other science, Fr eemasonry is progressive in its c haracter. It must of necessity be influenced by the progress of the age. Even now it is in a transition state in this country, passing from the simple social condition which it presented less than hal f a century ago to the character of scientific and philosophical association. For proof of this, look to th e Grand Lodge proceedings of 1815 and 1858. With the progress of li terary improvement, the Landmarks do not interfere. 6 Smith says that at the institution of the Craft to each of th e degrees, “a particular distinguishing test was adopted, which te st, together with the explication, was accordingly settled and communicated to the fraternity previous to their dispersion , under a necessary and solemn injunction to secrecy; and they have been most cautiously preserved and transmitted down to posterity by faithf ul brethren ever since their emigration.” — Use and Abuse of Fr eemasonry, p. 46. 7 That proposition is contained in the 7th reso lution of the Congress, and is in these words: “Masters of Lodges, in conferring t he degree of Master Mason, should invest the candidate with the words, signs and gr ips of the Scottish and Modern rites.” If the Landmark had never been violated, the r esolution would have been unnecessary. The symbolic degrees being the foundation of all Masonry, s hould never have been permitted to differ in any of the rites. 8 Smith thus accounts for this Landmark: “Though there were no apprentices employed in the building of the temple, yet as the cra ftsmen were all intended to be promoted to the degree of Masters, after its dedication; and as these would receive a succession by receiving apprentices, who might themselves in due time become Masters, it was determined that the graduations in the science sh ould consist in three distinct degrees.” — Use and Abuse of Fr eemasonry, p. 46, Lond., 1783. 9 Dr. Oliver says that “the difference between the ancient and m odern systems (that is, between the ancient and modern Lodges in the 18th century) consisted solely in the mutilation of the third degree.” See “Some Account of the Schi sm.” etc., which contains a full relation of this disruption of the Royal Arch from the Master’s degree. 10 The true word, which is the sym bol of divine truth, is the greatest object of Fr eemasonry. Any system without it must be imperf ect; and therefore in all the various rites, and I might almost say that their nam e was legion, this true word is sought fo r, but the search is in each prosecuted in a different way, which really constitutes the essential difference of the Masonic rites. 11 It is declared and pronounced that pure ancient Masonry consis ts of three degrees, and no more; viz.: those of the Entered Appr entice, the Fellow Craft and the Master Mason, including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Ar ch. — Articles of Union between the two Grand Lodges of England, 1813. Art. ii."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 MACKEY’S LANDMARKS Landmark Third The legend of the third degree is an important Landm ark, the integrity of which has been well preserved. 12 There is no rite in Masonry, practiced in any country or language, in which the essential elements of this legend are not taught. The lectures may vary, and indeed are const antly changing, but the legend has ever remained substantially the same. And it is necessa ry that it should be so, for the legend of the Temple Builder constitutes the very essence and identity of Masonry. Any rite which should exclude it, or materially alter it, would at once, by that exclusion or alteration, cease to be a Masonic rite. Landmark Fourth The government of the fraternity, by a presiding office r called a Grand Master, who is elected from the body of the Craft, is a fourth Landmark of the Order. 13 Many persons ignorantly suppose that the election of the Grand Master is held in consequence of a law or regulati on of the Grand Lodge. Such, however, is not the case. 14 The office is indebted for its existence to a Landmar k of the Craft. Grand Masters are to be f ound in the records of the institution long before Grand Lodges were established: and if the pres ent system of legislativ e government by Grand Lodges were to be abolished, a Grand Master would still be necessar y. In fact, although there has been a period within the records of history, and indeed of very recent date, when a Grand Lodge was unknown, there never has been a time when the Craft did not have their Grand Master. 15 Landmark Fifth The prerogative of the Gr and Master to preside over every as sembly of the Craft, wheresoever and whensoever held, is a Fifth Landmark. It is in consequence of this law, derived from ancient usage, and not from any special enactment, that the Grand Master assumes the chair, or as it is called in England, “the throne,” at every communication of the Grand Lodge; 16 and that he is also entitled to preside at the communication of every Subordinate Lodge, where he may happen to be present. 17 Landmark Sixth The prerogative of the Grand Master to grant dispensa tions for conferring degrees at irregular times, is another and a very important Landmark. The statutory law of Masonry requires a month, or other determinate period, to elapse between the presentation of a petition and the election of a candidate. But the Grand Master has the power to set aside or dispense with this probation, and to al low a candidate to be initiat ed at once. This prerogative he possessed in common with all Masters, 18 before the enactment of the law requiri ng a probation, and as no statute can impair his prerogative, he still retains the power, although the Masters of Lodges no longer possess it. 12 ”After the union of speculative and operative Masonry, and when th e temple of Solomon was completed, a legend of sublime and sy mbolic meaning was introduced into the system, which is still retained, and consequently known to all Master Masons.” — Oliver, Landmarks, vol. ii., p. 169. 13 ”No brother can be a Warden, until he has passed the part of a Fellow Craft; nor a Master, until he has acted as Warden; nor Gr and Warden, until he has been Master of a Lodge; nor Grand Master, unless he has been a Fellow Craft before his election.” — Old Charges, iv. 14 14 ”The mode and time of his election is, in modern times, prescribed by a regulation of the Grand Lodge, it is true, but the offi ce itself exists independently of any such regulation. When installed into office, it is not as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge, but as the “Grand Master of Masons.” — See Anderson’s Constitution, 2d edit. passi m. The earliest references to the office in English Masonry is in the time of the Emperor Carausius, in the third century, who, as Preston states, “granted the Masons a charter. and comm anded Albanus to preside over them in person as Grand Master.” — Preston Illustrations, p. 125. Oliv. edit. 15 ”The Grand Master is not a creation of the General Regulations, the Ancient Charges or Written Constitutions. He existed when a ll those that we know anything of were made.” — Corn. of Correspond, G. L. N.Y. 1851. 16 The Thirty-nine General Regulations, adopted in 1721, acknowl edged this Landmark in the following words: “The Grand Lodge consi sts of and is formed by the Master and Wardens of all the regular particular Lodges on record , with the Grand Master at their head.” — Twelfth Regulation. 17 Thus, in the first General Regulations, “The Grand Master, or his Deputy, hath authority and right, not only to be present in a ny true Lodge, but also to preside wheresoever he is, with the Master of the Lodge on his left hand.” 18 Preston says: “A sufficient number of Masons met together within a certain district, with the consent of the sheriff or chief m agistrate of the place, were empowered at this time, (i.e. anterior to 1717) to make Masons and practice the rites of Masonry without warrant of constitution. The privil ege was inherent in them as individuals; and this privilege is still enjoyed by the two old Lodges now extant, wh ich act by immemorial constitu tion.” — Illustrations, p. 18 2, note."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 MACKEY’S LANDMARKS Landmark Seventh The prerogative of the Grand Master to give di spensations for opening and holding Lodges is another Landmark. He may grant, in virtue of this, to a sufficien t number of Masons, the priv ilege of meeting together and conferring degrees. The Lodges thus established are called “Lodges under Dispensation.” T hey are strictly creatures of the Grand Master, created by his author ity, existing only during his will and pl easure, and liable at any moment to be dissolved at his command. They may be continued for a day, a month or six months; but whatever be the period of their existence, they are indebt ed for that existence solely to the grace of the Grand Master. 19 Landmark Eighth The prerogative of the Grand Master to make Maso ns at sight, is a Landmark which is closely connected with the preceding one. 20 There has been much misapprehension in relation to this Landmark, which misapprehension has sometimes led to a denial of its exist ence in jurisdictions where the Grand Master was perhaps at the very time substantially ex ercising the prerogative without t he slightest remark or opposition. 21 It is not to be supposed that the Grand Master can retire with a profane in to a private room, and there, without assistance, confer the degrees of Freemasonry upon him. No such prerogative ex ists, and yet many believe that this is the so much talked of fight of “making Masons at sight.” The real m ode and the only mode of exerci sing the prerogative is this: The Grand Master summons to his assistance not less than six other Masons, convenes a Lodge, and without any previous probation, but on sight of the candidate, confer s the degrees upon him, after which he dissolves the Lodge, and dismisses the brethren. Lodges thus convened for special purposes are called “occasional Lodges.” This is the only way in which any Grand Master within the records of the institution has ever been known to “make a Mason at sight.” The prerogative is dependent upon that of granting dispensations to open and hold Lodges. If the Grand Master has the power of granting to any other Mason the privilege of presiding over Lodges working by his dispensation, he may assume this privilege of presiding to himself; and as no one can deny his right to revoke his dispensation granted to a number of bret hren at a distance, and to dissolve the Lodge at his pleasure, it will scarcely be contended that he may not revoke his dispensation for a Lodge over which he himself has been presiding, within a day, and dissolve the Lodge as soon as the business for wh ich he had assembled it is accomplished. The making of Masons at sight is only the co nferring of the degrees by the Grand Ma ster, at once, in an occasional Lodge, 22 constituted by his dispensing power for the purpo se, and over which he presides, in person. Landmark Ninth The necessity for Masons to congregate in Lodges is another Landmark. 23 It is not to be understood by this that any ancient Landmark has directed that permanent organization of Subordinate Lodges which constitutes one of the features of the Masonic system as it now prevails. Bu t the Landmarks of the Craft always prescribed that Masons should from time to time congregate together, for the purpose of either operative or spec ulative labor, and that these congregations should be called Lodges. Formerly these were extemporary meetings called together for special purposes, and then dissolved, the brethren departing to meet again at other times and places, according to the necessity of circumstances. But warrant s of constitution, by-laws, permanent officers and annual arrears, are modern innovations wholly outside the Landmarks, and dependent entirely on the special enactments of a comparatively recent period. 19 If according to the preceding note, the privilege of meeting and conferring the degrees was originally inherent in all Masons, as individuals, then it must also have been inherent in the Grand Master, and was therefore his prerogative, as well as that of every other member of the Craft. But a t the reorganization of the Craft in 1717, the Masons, as a body, surrendered this prerogative to the Grand Lodge; (see Preston, as above, ) but they could not surrender t he prerogative of the Grand Master, for it was not theirs to surrender. Consequently he still exercises it, and may assemble Masons together either personally or by pr oxy; in such cases, the Lodge meets, as of old, without a warrant of co nstitution; and to enable it to do so, the Grand Ma ster issues his dispensation; that is, he dis penses with the law enacted in 1717, which requires such warrant. 20 ”We think this to be the rule because we do not think the regul ation of June 24, 1717, restricting the future assemblage of Mas ons, except in the four old Lodges in London, to Lodges held under warrant, was intended to apply to the Grand Master or the Grand Lodge in session, but rather to th e craft in other respects.” — Com. of Correspond, G. L. of N.Y., 1851. Of course not; for if it did, s upposing that it legally could, then the Grand Master would be deprived of the power of granting dispensations to open Lodges, for his prerogative of making Masons at sight and of opening Lodges are rounded on the same princ iple. 21 That is, whenever the Grand Master granted his dispensation to an unchartered Lodge to dispense with the necessary probation, a nd was present and presiding at the conferring of the degrees, he was virtually making a Mason at sight. 22 These occasional Lodges have been often called by the English Gra nd Masters since 1717, and frequent records of the fact are to be found in Anderson’s Constitutions. Almost all of the princes of the royal family, when made Masons, were initiated, passed and raised at sight, and in occasional Lodges. 23 ”A Lodge is a place where Masons assemble and work; hence that assembly or duly organized society of Masons is called a Lodge, and every brother ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its by-laws and the general regulations.” — Old Charges, iii."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 MACKEY’S LANDMARKS Landmark Tenth The government of the Craft, when so congregated in a Lodge by a Master and two Wardens, is also a Landmark. 24 To show the influence of this ancient law, it may be observed by the way, that a congregation of Masons meeting together under any other government, as that for in stance of a president and vice-president, or a chairman and sub-chairman, would not be recognized as a Lodge. The presence of a Master and tw o Wardens is as essential to the valid organization of a Lodge as a warrant of constituti on is at the present day. The names, of course, vary in different languages, the Master, for instance, being call ed “Venerable” in French Masonry, and the Wardens “Surveillants,” but the o fficers, their number, 25 prerogatives, and duties, are everywhere identical. Landmark Eleventh The necessity that every Lodge, when congregated, should be duly tiled, is an important Landmark of the institution, which is never neglected. Th e necessity of this law arises from t he esoteric character of Masonry. As a secret institution, its portals must of course be guarded from the intrusi on of the profane, and such a law must therefore always have been in force from the very beginning of the Craft. 26 It is therefore properly classed among the most ancient Landmarks. The office of Tiler is wholly independent of any special enactment of the Grand or Subordinate Lodges, although these may and do prescribe for him additional duties, which vary in different jurisdictions. But the duty of guarding the door, and keeping off cowans and eavesdroppers, is an ancient one, which constitutes a Landmark for his government. Landmark Twelfth The right of every Mason to be represented in all general meetings of the Craft, and to instruct his representatives, is a twelfth Landmark. 27 Formerly, these general meetings, which were usually held once a year, were called “General Assemblies,” and all the fraternity, even to the youngest Entered Apprentice, were permitted to be present. Now they are called “Grand Lodges,” and only t he Masters and Wardens of the Subordinate Lodges are summoned. But this is simply as the representatives of their members. Originally, each Mason represented himself; now he is represented by his officers. This was a conces sion granted by the fraternity about 1717, and of course does not affect the integrity of the Landm ark, for the principle of representatio n is still preserved. The concession was made only for purposes of convenience. 28 Landmark Thirteenth The right of every Mason to appeal from the decision of his brethren in Lodge convened, to the Grand Master or General Assembly of Masons, is a Landmark highly esse ntial to the preservation of justice, and the prevention of oppression. 29 A few modern Grand Lodges, in adopting a regulatio n that the decision of Subordinate Lodges, in cases of expulsion, cannot be wholly set aside upon an app eal, have violated this unquestioned Landmark, as well as the principles of just government. 24 The Old Charges allude to the antiquity of these officers in the following language: “In ancient times no Master or Fellow coul d be absent from the Lodge when warned to appear at it, without incurring a severe censure until it appeared to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hind ered him.” — Charges, iii. 25 The number, three, of thes e officers, is essential to the symbolism of the Cr aft, because they refer, as corresponding officers always did, in the ancient Mysteries, to the sun at its rising, its meridian height, and its setting. So long as Masonry preserves its symbolic character, these officer s must be retained, and their peculiar positions preserved. 26 The appointment of a Tiler is so evidently a Landmark, and the necessity of such an officer so apparent, from the very characte r of the Masonic institution, that neither the Old Charges nor the General Regulations make any allusion to hi m, except that the latter refer to the qualifications of the Grand Tiler of the Grand Lodge. 27 This Landmark is recognized by the General Regulations in these words: “The majority of every particular Lodge, when congregate d, shall have the privilege of giving instructions to their Master and Wardens before the assembling of the Grand Chapter or Grand Lodge.” — Gen. Reg., Art. x. 28 See a full relation of the history of this concession in Pres ton. (Oliver’s edition, pp. 182-184.) The result of the concession is given in these words: “Matters being thus amicably adjusted, the brethren of the four old Lodges considered their attendance on the future communication of the society a s unnecessary, and, therefore, like the other Lodges, trusted implicitly to their Master and Wardens, resting satisfied th at no measure of importance would be adopted without their approbat ion.” — Illust., p. 183. 29 The Old Charges recognize this right of appeal in these words: “If any complaint be brought, the brother found guilty shall sta nd to the award and determination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent judges of all such contro versies, unless you carry it by appeal to the Grand Lodge.” — Charge vi., 1."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 MACKEY’S LANDMARKS Landmark Fourteenth The right of every Mason to visit and sit in every regular Lodge is an unquestionable Landmark of the Order. 30 This is called “the right of visitation.” This right of visitation has always been recognized as an inherent fight, which inures to every Mason as he travels through the worl d. And this is because Lodges are justly considered as only divisions for convenience of the universal Masonic fam ily. This right may, of course, be impaired or forfeited on special occasions by various circumstances; but when adm ission is refused to a Mason in good standing, who knocks at the door of a Lodge as a visitor, it is to be expected that some good and sufficient reason shall be furnished for this violation of what is in general a Masonic right, rounded on the Landmark of the Craft. Landmark Fifteenth It is a Landmark of the Craft, that no vi sitor, unknown to the brethren presen t, or to some one of them as a Mason, can enter a Lodge without first passing an examination according to ancient usage. 31 Of course, if the visitor is known to any brother present to be a Mason in good standi ng, and if that brother will vouch for his qualifications, the examination may be dispensed with, as the Landmark refe rs only to the cases of strangers, who are not to be recognized unless after strict trial, due examination, or lawful information. Landmark Sixteenth No Lodge can interfere in the business of another Lo dge, nor give degrees to brethren who are members of other Lodges. 32 This is undoubtedly an ancient Landmark, founded on t he great principles of courtesy and fraternal kindness, which are at the very foundat ion of our institution. It has been r epeatedly recognized by subsequent statutory enactments of all Grand Lodges. Landmark Seventeenth It is a Landmark that every Freemason is amendable to t he laws and regulations of the Masonic Jurisdiction in which he resides, and this although he may not be a memb er of any lodge.33 Non-affiliation, which is, in fact, in itself a Masonic offense, does not exem pt a Mason from Masonic jurisdiction. Landmark Eighteenth Certain qualifications of candidates for initia tion are derived from a Landmark of the Craft. 34 These qualifications are that he should be a man shall be unmutilated, free born, and of mature age. 35 That is to say, a woman, a cripple, or a slave, or one born in slavery, is dis qualified for initiation into the rites of Masonry. Statutes, it is true, have from time to time been enacted, enforcing or explai ning these principles; but the qualifications really arise from the very nature of the Masonic institutions and from its symbolic teachings, and have always existed as Landmarks. 30 The MS. in possession of the Lodge of Antiquity, and which cont ains charges written in the re ign of James II., between 1685 and 1688, recognizes this right of visitation in the welcome which it orders every Mason to give to a strange brother: “Thirteenthly, that every Mason receive and cherish strange Fellows, when they come over the country, and set them on work, if they will work, as the manner is; that is to say, if the Mason have any mould s tone in his place, he shall give him a mould stone, and set him on work; and if he have none, the Maso n shall refresh him with money unto the next Lodge.” All this im plies the right to claim and the duty to extend hospitality to a visiting brother. 31 Reference is made to this important Landmark in the Old Charges, vi. 6, in the directions for “behavior to a strange brother,” where we find the following language; “You are cautioned to examine him in such method as prudence s hall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and derision, and beware of giving him any hints of knowledge.” 32 Thus in the MS. charges of the Lodge of Antiquity: “That no Master or Fellow suppl ant others of their work; that is, if he hath taken a work or else stand Master of any work, that he (i.e. any others) shall not put him out, unl ess he be unable of cunning to make an end of his work.” 33 33 The same charges recognize this Landmark in these words: “Tenthly, that every Master and Fellow shall come to the assembly, if it be within fifty miles of him, if he have any warning. And if he have trespassed against the craft, to abide the award of Masters and Fellows.” And again, “Eleventh y, that every Master Mason and Fellow that hath trespassed against the craft, shall stand to the correct ion of other Masters and Fellows to make him accord, and if h e cannot accord, to go to the common law.” 34 Thus in the same MS. charges these qualifications are referred to : “Thirdly, that he that be made, be able in all degrees; that is, free born, of good kindred, true, and no bondsman; and that he have his right limbs as a man ought to have.” And the Old C harges, collected in 1717, give the qualifi cations as follows: “The persons admitted members of a Lodge must be good and true men, free bor n and of mature and discreet age, no bondsmen, no women, no immo ral or scandalous men, but of good report.” 35 In the regulations adopted by the General Assembly, 27th Decem ber, 1663, the age is placed at twenty-one years: “That no person be accepted unless he be twenty- one years old or more.” — See Anderson, 2d edit. p. 102."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 MACKEY’S LANDMARKS Landmark Nineteenth A belief in the existence of God as the Grand Architec t of the universe, is one of the most important Landmarks of the Order. 36 It has been always deemed essential that a denial of the existence of a Supreme and Superintending Power is an absolute disqualification for init iation. The annals of the Craft never yet have furnished or could furnish an instance in which an avowed atheist was ev er made a Mason. The very initiatory ceremonies of the first degree forbid and prev ent the possibility of so monstrous an occurrence. Landmark Twentieth Subsidiary to this belief in God, as a Landmark of the Craft, is the belief in a resurrection to a future life. 37 This Landmark is not so positively impressed on the candida te by exact words as the preceding; but the doctrine is taught by very plain implication, and r uns through the whole symbolism of the Craft. To believe in Masonry, and not to believe in a resurrection, would be an absurd anomaly, which could only be excused by the reflection, that he who thus confounded his belief and his skepticism, was so ignorant of the meaning of both theories as to have no rational foundation for his knowledge of either. Landmark Twenty-first It is a Landmark, that a “Book of the Law” shall consti tute an indispensable part of the furniture of every Lodge. 38 I say advisedly, a Book of the Law, because it is not absolutely required that everywhere the Old and New Testaments shall be used. The “Book of t he Law” is that volume which, by the religion of the country is believed to contain the revealed will of the Grand Architect of the univers e. Hence, in all Lodges in Christian countri es, the “Book of the Law” is composed of the Old and New Testaments; in a country where Judaism was the prevailing faith, the Old Testament alone would be sufficient; and in Mohammedan countries, and among Mohammedan Masons the Koran might be substituted. Masonry does not attempt to interfere with the pec uliar religious faith of its disciples, except so far as relates to the belief in the existenc e of God, and what necessarily results from that belief. 39 The Book of the Law is to the speculative Mason his spiritual Trestle board; without this he cannot labor; whatever he believes to be the revealed will of the Gr and Architect constitutes for him this spirit ual Trestleboard, and must ever be before him in his hours of speculative labor, to be the rule and gui de of his conduct. The Landmark, therefore, requires that a Book of the Law, a religious code of some kind, purporting to be an exemplar of the revealed will of God, shall form an essential part of the fu rniture of every Lodge. Landmark Twenty-second The equality of all Masons is another Landmark of the Craft. 40 This equality has no reference to any subversion of those gradations of rank which ha ve been instituted by the usages of society. 41 The monarch, the nobleman or the gentleman is entitled to all the influence, and receives all the respect which rightly belong to his exalted position. But the doctrine of Masonic equality implie s that, as children of one great Father, we meet in the Lodge upon the level that on that level we are all trave ling to one predestined goal that in the Lodge genuine merit shall receive more respect than boundless wealth, and t hat virtue and knowledge alone should be the basis of all Masonic honors, and be rewarded with preferment. 42 When the labors of the Lod ge are over, and the brethren have retired from their peaceful retreat, to mingle once more with the world, each will then again resume that social position, and exercise the privilege s of that rank, to which the customs of society entitle them. 36 It were needless to cite authorities on this point. We might sa y, that the very first of the Old Charges begins by declaring th at “a Mason is obliged by his tenure to obey the moral law, and if he rightly understands the art, he will never be a stupid atheist, nor an irreligious libertine.” 37 The whole scope and design of the third degree is, to teach the resu rrection from the dead, as that of the Royal Arch is to inc ulcate the rewards of a future life. If the doctrine of the resurrection were false, then would the ceremoni es of the third degree be simply a farce; and hence Hutchinson who had profoundly studied its symbolism, says, that the Master Mason’s degr ee “testifies our faith concerning the re surrection of the body.” — Spirit of Maso nry, p. 101. 38 The presence of a Book of the Law in a Lodge, as a part of its furniture, is strictly a ritual istic Landmark, and the authoriti es for it will be at once evident to every Mason. 39 On the subject of the religious, or rather the doctrinal, requi rements of Masonry, the Old C harges utter the following explicit language: “Though in ancient times, Masons were charged in every country to be of the religion of t hat country or nation, whatever it was; yet it is now thought ex pedient only to oblige them to that religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves.” — Charge, i. 40 ”Masons meet upon the level.” — Ritual. 41 Though all Masons are as brethren upon the same level, yet Maso nry takes no honor from a man that he had before; nay, rather it adds to his honor, especially if he has deserved well of the brotherhood, who must give honor to whom it is due, and avoid ill manners.” — Old Charges, vi., 3. 42 ”All preferment among Masons is grounded upon real worth and personal merit only.” — Old Charges, iv."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 MACKEY’S LANDMARKS Landmark’s Twenty-third The secrecy of the institution is another and a most important Landmark. 43 There is some difficulty in precisely defining, what is meant by a “secret society.” If the term refers, as perhaps, in strictly logical language it should, to those associations whose designs are conceal ed from the public eye, and whose members are unknown, which produce their results in darkness, and whose operations are carefully hidden from the public gaze a definition which will be appropriate to many political clubs and revoluti onary combinations in despotic counties, where reform, if it is at all to be effected, must be effected by stealth then clearly Freemasonry is not a secr et society. Its design is not only publicly proclaimed, but is vaunted by its disciples as something to be venerated its disciples are known, for its membership is considered an honor to be coveted it work s for a result of which it boasts the civilization and refinement of man, the amelioration of hi s condition, and the reformation of his m anners. But if by a secret society is meant and this is the most popular understanding of the te rm a society in which there is a certain amount of knowledge, whether it be of methods of recogni tion, or of legendary and traditional learning, 44 which is imparted to those only who have passed through an established form of init iation, the form itself being also concealed or esoteric, then in this sense is Freemasonry undoubtedly a secret societ y. Now, this form of secrecy is a form inherent in it, existing with it from its very foundation, and secured to it by its ancient Landmarks. If dive sted of its secret character, it would lose its identity, and would cease to be Freemasonry. 45 Whatever objections may, therefore, be made to the institution on account of its secrecy, and however much some unskill ed brethren have been willing in times of trial, for the sake of expediency, to divest it of its secret char acter, it will be ever impossible to do so, even were the Landmark not standing before us as an insurmountable obsta cle; because such change of its character would be social suicide, and the death of the Craft would follow its l egalized exposure. Freemasonry, as a secret association, has lived unchanged for centuries as an open societ y it would not last for as many years. Landmark Twenty-fourth The foundation of a speculative science upon an operati ve art, and the symbolic use and explanation of the terms of that art, for purposes of religious or mo ral teaching, constitute another Landmark of the Order. 46 The Temple of Solomon was the cradle of the institution, 47 and, therefore, the reference to the operative Masonry which constructed that magnificent edifice, to the materials and im plements which were employed in its construction, and to the artists who we reengaged in the building, are all com ponent and essential parts of the body of Freemasonry, which could not be subtracted from it without an entire destr uction of the whole identity of the Craft. Hence, all the comparatively modern rites of Masonry, however they may di ffer in other respects, religiously preserve this temple history and these operative elements, as the substratum of all their modi fications of the Masonic system. Landmark Twenty-fifth The last and crowning Landmark of all is , that these Landmarks can never be changed. 48 Nothing can be subtracted from them, nothing can be added to them, not t he slightest modification can be made in them. As they were received from our predecessors, we are bound by the most solemn oblig ation of duty to transmit them to our successors. Not one jot or one title of these unwritten laws can be repealed; for in respect to them, we are not only willing, but compelled to adopt the language of the sturdy old barons of England, “Nolumus leges mutari.” 43 There are abundant cautions in the Old Charges which recognize th e existence of this Landmark, and the necessity of preserving it. Thus in the direction for the behavior of brethren who meet without strange rs, it is said: “You will salute one anot her in a courteous manner... freely givin g mutual instructions as shall be thought expedient, without being overseen or overheard”; and in the presence of strangers: “You should be cautious in your words and ca rriage that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated.” 44 The Leland MS. containing the answers of the Masons to the questions of King Henry the Sixth gives a long list of the secrets w hich the Masons “conceal and hide,” the catalogue of secret sciences ending wi th “the universalle longage of Masonnes,” th at is, the peculiar modes of recognition. 45 ”Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the Craft, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community , and mark your consequences among Masons.” — Charges to an Ent.

They are edicts, judicial not legislative action of the Grand Lodge, and while they apply only to the instant case, they are helpful in understanding the law and may overrule a previous edict. Not all edicts are shown here. Some have been made obsolete by revision of the Code or incorporated in it, and some seem to merely restate the Code section. Those set out hereafter may apply to other sections than the ones cited, but an attempt is made to relate the edict to some section or sections of the Code. In some cases, an annotation is an interpretation by someone other than a Grand Master. In such case, the author of, or authority for such interpretation is expressly stated. 3.01 O.E.S. member of Wisconsin Lodge must be governed by laws of another state while there if Mason in that state cannot attend O.E.S. meetings. 1958. 9.01 If Temple owned by several bodies, lodge must obtain dispensation to meet there. 1949. 22.02 Grand Master may require trial record not to leave Grand Secretary’s office. 1947. 22.03 Grand Master may suspend Junior Warden of Lodge. 1956. 22.03 Women’s organization requires dispensation no matter what the ownership is of the Temple. The three lodges using the Temple will all have to ask for the dispensation. 1955. 22.03 (h) The Grand Master may revoke a dispensation to a ladies organization to meet in the Temple and may deny one. 1948. 22.04 (Second) Grand Lodge, by adoption of Resolu tion 2, 1972, authorized the Grand Master to designate the place of holding the June 1974 Communication of the Grand Lodge if done in writing prior to July 1, 1973. 22.04 (Second) Grand Lodge, by adoption of an Amendment to the Report of the Special Co mmittee on Taxation, 1978, authorized the Grand Master to take such action on behalf of the Grand Lodge with respect to the current membership practices as the Grand Master may determine appropriate. Similar authority given to Grand Master by adoption of Taxation Report, 1979 and Executive Committ ee Report, 1980. 22.04 (Second) By adoption of Executive Committee Report, 1980, Grand Master was given certain authority with respect to proficiency of candidates and serving of wine/beer in Masonic Temples.

Qualification, Responsibility & Authority of Trustees Grand Lodge Free & Accepted Masons of Wisconsin I. QUALIFICATION OF TRUSTEES Number: Three (3).  Qualification: Resident of Wisconsin. Member of a Wisconsin Lodge. Elected at annual communication or appointed by Grand Master if vacancy occurs. Length of Office: One term plus any appointed time to fill a vacancy. A term is five years. The three Trustees terms are scattered - only one is elected at each annual co mmunication resulting in no more than one Trustee retiring in a given year. Cannot be re-elected for more than two successive terms. Vacancy: Grand Master may fill vacancy until election. Chairman: At first meeting following annual communication trustees shall elect a chairman. Sources: Sec. 188.04 Wis. Stats.; Art. 6, Sec. 6.02, 6.03 and 6.07 Constitution of the Grand Lodge; Sec. 28.01, 28.02, 28.03 a nd 28.07, Laws of the Grand Lodge. II. NATURE OF THE POSITION (Chapter 188 Wis. Stats.) Trustee is a statutory office, not a Maso nic office. (Sec. 28.01, General Laws of Ma sonry.) As such, the Trustees have the following statutory authority: A. General Authority - Sec. 188.01, Wis. Stats. “. . . to take care of the property, real and personal , belonging thereto and transact all the business relating to the investment and disposal thereof.” B. “[The Trustees]... in pursuance of the rules and regulations of such society and in conformity with the rules and regulatio ns of the Grand Lodge.” 1. “. . . may take possession of, manage, control, purchase, lease, receive, recover, hold, sell, convey, mortgage, demise an d improve all the property thereof or necessary therefore, real and personal... erect and keep in repair all buildings necessary therefore . . .” 2. “. . . may sue and be sued in all matters pertaining to such property and the debts, clai ms, demands and liabilities there of... [in the name of... the trustees of the Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Masons of Wisconsin.]” C. Corporate Status - See. 188.02, Wis. Stats. “[The Trustees]... may have a common seal... and for all purposes for which they are authorized to act, they shall be deemed a corporation.” III. SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITY A. The Laws of the Grand Lodge provide these duties and limitations of authority: 1. General Supervision of Grand Lodge Property . (Sec.28.05, Laws of the Grand Lodge) They shall ”...exercise a general supervision over the property, bot h real and personal, including the trus t funds of the Grand Lodge and receive and hold title thereto” (although law provides “unless otherwis e provided by regulation of the Grand Lodge,” that is probably invalid as contrary to Sec. 188.02 Wis. Stats.) 2. Execution of Contracts and Conveyances. (Sec. 28.05, Laws of the Grand Lo dge) They shall “. . . execute all conveyances for and on behalf of the Grand Lodge and to make contracts, leases and agreements in their names, as they may be authorized by the Grand Lodge or by law.”"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 ANNOTATIONS 3. Prosecution of Legal Proceedings. (Sec. 28.05, Laws of the Grand Lodge) “. . . whenever in their judgment ... it shall be necessary to institute and prosecute legal proceedings in their ow n names for the preservation and protection of the property or rights of the Grand Lodge, to do so.” 4. Investing of Funds. (Sec. 28.05, Laws of the Grand Lodge; Chapter 33, Laws of the Grand Lodge) The Trustees are authorized to invest the trust funds and surplus cash funds of the Grand Lodge. Investing of funds shall be subject to the “prudent man” rules; and the Trustees shall not be liable in the absence of gross malfeasan ce or nonfeasance in all other matters. Appreciation in assets shall be treated as principal. For investment purposes, funds may be commingled, although doubtless where a gift specifies otherwise, this would not be authorized. 5. Custody of Securities - Reports to Annual Communication. (Sec. 28.04, Laws of the Grand Lodge) “The Trustees shall have custody of all bonds, obligations and securities belonging to the Grand Lodge and shall submit to the Grand Lodge at each annual communication a report on their official acts.” B. Implied Powers - Sec. 28.05 (4), Laws of the Grand Lodge Hiring of Personnel. The Trustees doubtless have implicit power to hire personnel where reas onably necessary to perform their duties, although not expressly set out. C. The above powers are subject to the following limitations - Sec. 28.05, Laws of the Grand Lodge The Trustees must obtain approval of the Grand Lodge or Grand Master before: 1. “The purchasing, selling, leasing or mortgaging of any property having a value of more than $10,000.00.” 2. “The purchasing, selling, investing, lending, borrowing or pledging of any personal property having a value of more than $25,000.00.” 3. “Participating in litigation determining any rights of the Grand Lodge of a value in excess of $10,000.00.” 4. “Employing any personnel for a period of more than one month at a rate of compensation in excess of $1,000.00 per month.” IV. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER MASONIC PERSONS OR BODIES A. Grand Master - Since the Grand Master “exercises the function of the Grand Lodge when not in session,” the Trustees must obey all lawful rules and regulations promulgated by the Grand Master. The Trustees, for example, may not lawfully obey a rule of the Grand Master (or Grand Lodge) th at in their reasonable view would unreasonably jeopardize the safety of the property under their care, or which would la y waste assets of the Grand Lodge. It is also probable a Grand Master cannot discharge a Grand Trustee. Sources: Chapter 22, 28, Laws of the Grand Lodge; Chapter 188, Wis. Stats. B. Grand Treasurer - 1. The Trustees may compel the Grand Treasurer, or other Gr and Officer, to issue and sign checks in pursuance of the Trustees’ responsibilities and authorities above stated. Sources: Sec. 32.05, Laws of the Grand Lodge; Implicit in Chapter 28 2. The Trustees may also order such financial reports fr om the Grand Secretary and Grand Treasurer it deems necessary, and in any event the Grand Treasurer and Grand Secretary shall report to them in detail “all money by them respectively received, where and from what source, and what disposition has been made ther eof, since the comme ncement of their current term of office up to and including the lst day of May. . .” Sources: Chapter 34, Laws of the Grand Lodge C. Grand Secretary - The Trustees shall receive from the Grand Secret ary at the expiration of his term of office an accounting for and possession of “all monies , securities and property in his possessi on, custody or cont rol belonging to the Grand Lodge which have not been theretofore duly accounted for.” Source: Sec. 25.04, Laws of the Grand Lodge"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 ANNOTATIONS D.

Wisconsin Masonic Home Inc. - The Trustees have no responsibilities over the Wisconsin Masonic Home, Inc. which is a separate corporation with a separate Board of Directors. However, the property on which the Home is operated is owned by the Grand Lodge and therefore is the responsibility of the Grand Trustees, to the same extent other Grand Lodge Masonic property is their responsibility. G. Constituent Lodges - Since each constituent lodge has its own Trustees who have supervision ove r their own property, the Grand Trustees have no authority or responsibilities w ith respect to property of any of the constituent lodges.

Voting Power at A nnual Communication A Trustee has one vote at Grand Lodge on every question. Source: Art. 8. Sec. 8.01, Constitution of the Grand Lodge B.

Such matters should be settled outside the lodge by the parties in interest. 1909. 52.20 A lodge is forbidden to put on a drive for membership. 1938. 54.08 See Annotation at 52.01. 55.02 An Illinois member cannot be plural in Wisconsin.

If he is in default, he must be voted on before objection can be made. 1952. 75.01 Conditional objection becomes absolute if not withdrawn with in six months even though the objector is tried and suspended indefinitely. 1948. 75.01 Any number of conditional objections are permitted. 1954. 75.03 A favorable ballot on the application of a rejected petitione r being void because it was had before the expiration of one year after his rejection, an objection then made to hi s initiation is likewise void, and unless renewed, is ineffective to prevent his initiation should he be elected by a legal ballot taken after the year shall have elapsed. 1908. 75.03 If objection to advancement is made to the Master in the interim between two communications, he shall report the same to the lodge at the next stated communication and order a ballot taken at the following stated communication. 1932. 75.03 When the candidate has been elected for advancement after objec tion, the Master shall omit the phrase before conferring the degree, “If there be no objection,” since no further objection can be entertained. 1936. 75.03 When the ballot after objection is favorable and the candida te neglects for one year af ter such ballot to present himself for advancement but on his application is thereaft er elected, since he has perm itted himself to become in default he has forfeited the benefit of the first ballot and objection may again be made to his advancement. 1895. 75.03 After objection, after a ballot is ordered and passed by a three-fourths vote, no other brother can make objection on the same degree. 1939. 75.03 If there is an objection to advancement, there must be a ballot which must be three-fourths clear. 1947. 75.06 A ballot upon the advancement of a candidate after objection in which the members voted “yes” and “no” on slips of paper, which were counted by tellers who announced the result, is illegal for the reason that such a ballot is not secret. 1930. 75.09 An objection addressed to the lodge, mailed to the Secretary and by him handed to the Master, shall be regarded. 1911. 75.09 An objection made to the Secr etary of a lodge to be by him communicated to the Master is legal though not in writing. 1938. 75.09 In case of the absence of the Master, an objection should be left with the Acting Master or made directly to the presiding officer. 1882. 75.09 An objection need not be in writing and is not required to be made at a communication of the lodge. 1938.

The use of the telephone for such purpose is highly improper unless knowle dge comes to the objector at such a late date as to make this means of communication imperative. If, however, objection is made in this manner, the Master should satisfy himself as to the identity of the objector, and if he finds that the objection comes from one who is entitled to object he should heed the same. 1932. 75.10 An objection to the advancement of a candidate who, after receiving the fi rst section of a degree, refused to proceed further and on his demand was ta ken from the lodge room and who some time thereafter asked to proceed, is ineffective for the reason th at the candidate has already advanced to the degree by assuming the obligation thereof and such objection comes too late. 1889. 75.10 An objector being in good standing at the time he makes an objection, his subsequent suspension or expulsion does not invalidate the objection. 1885. 76.01 An applicant for initiation or advan cement to avoid being in default must present himself and receive the degree on or before the day prior to the anniversary of his election, initiation or passing, as the case may be. 1902. 76.01 A Fellowcraft having been suspended and restored after several years is in default. 1895. 76.01 Time in service is not part of year for default. 1945. 76.02 A candidate in default may make application to receive the work verbally or in writing. 1922. 76.02 If candidate presents himself w ithin year for advancement, he is not in default. 1953. 76.02 Candidate not in default if one year passes through no fault of his own. 1948. 76.03 Petitioner was elected and five years passed.

A lodge may receive a petition for affilia tion accompanied by a demit issued by any lodge in Wisconsin, although the petitioner resides without the state. 1916. As evidence of non-affiliati on a lodge may accept a demit, accompanying a petiti on for affiliation, which is issued by a military lodge operating under the charter of a Grand Lodge with which this Grand Lodge has fraternal relations, or if it has ceased to exist, the lodge may accept in lieu of such demit a certificate in the nature of a demit from such parent Grand Lodge . If neither such demit nor certificate can be obtained, the applicant must petition as a profane. 1920. An E. A. from Ohio three years in default and having had no examination may petition a Wisconsin lodge for affiliation. 1960. E. A. from Texas may proceed with examination and degrees without petitioning for degrees in Wisconsin lodge. 1956. A ballot should be had upon a petition for affiliation accompanie d by a demit or certificate of affiliation and reported upon by the investigating committee, although the demit or certificate has become lost. 1903. If other state will not grant a demit until member joins anothe r lodge, lodge may obtain a certificate of good standing and accept petition for affiliation. 1958. An applicant for affiliation may withdraw his petition and demit although charges are then pending against him, but the lodge may nevertheless proceed to a trial of the charges. 1865. An election of a non-affiliate is void if at a single communication his petition an d demit are received but not referred to a committee, no examination of th e applicant is had, and a motion is made an d carried to accept his petition and thereupon the Master declares him elected. 1909. A Mason who is regularly elected to membership in a lodge on his petition for affiliation becomes by such election a member thereof although he does not sign its By-laws. It is proper and desirable that he sign them and he should be given an opportunity to do so, but signing the By-laws does not make him a member; it simply furnishes evidence of his membership. 1894. 84.05 If the question of admission arises between a visiting Mason and a member, the Master should regard the wishes of the member in preference to those of the visitor. 1903. 84.05 If a member of a lodge objects to sitting with a visiting Mason and the latter is asked to leave, he cannot as a right demand the name of the objector or the grounds of his objection. 1900. 84.05 The Master cannot require a member to give his reasons for objecting to the presence of a visiting Mason. 1903. 86.01 A candidate to whose initiation objection has been made but which was not made known to the newly elected Master who initiated and passed him, is a Fellowcraft in good standing and entitled to all the rights and benefits of a Fellowcraft. 1894. 86.02 If posting an examination is not satisfactory, the newly elected Master may before advancement require further examination. 1947. 86.06 An excluded Mason can have an emblem on grave. 1949. 87.02 Widow of Wisconsin Mason marries a Mason of another ju risdiction.

They relate to th e Constitution and Laws of the Grand Lodge and Regulations for Lodges. The chapter number (or article number for the Constitution) is to the left of the decimal point, and the section number to the right. 6.01 means Article 6 of the Constitution, Section No. 1. With the decimal system it is possible to insert new sections i n their proper place. If it is necessary to put a ne w section between 6.01 and 6.02, the new section can be numbered 6.011. This is bec ause in the decimal system 6.01 is the same as 6.010, and 6.02 the same as 6.020. Thus 6.011 comes in between 6.01 and 6.02. This syste m is basically that used by the Wisconsin Statutes. Certain of these section numbers in the Wisconsin Statutes in the appendix are s ections of the Wisconsin Statutes. INTRODUCTION We have tried by cross references and key words to enable those not experts in Masonic Law to find what they are looking for w ith promptness, ease and accuracy.

The Ancient Charges and Landmarks (Parts 5 and 6) are not part of Wisconsin Masonic Law although included in the Appendix, and are indexed only to a lim ited extent herein, not indexed in detail as to content, just where referred to in the Code. Thus Landmark Eighteenth (Mackey) as to qualif ications of candidates for initiation is not indexed as such — otherwise the index would be just too bulky.

The administrator of the Home at Dousman or G.S.’s office has the information needed as to applications, guests, operation and qualifications for prospective guests. It is still the largest charity of Masons in Wis. and supported by the membership but for tax reasons is not a part of the G.L. itself. Accordingly only a few references to it are set forth in this index. There are various sources of income for the Wis.
