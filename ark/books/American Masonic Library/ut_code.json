The General Heads, Viz: I. Of God and Religion. II. Of the Civil Magistrate supreme and subordinate. III. Of Lodges. IV. Of Master, Wardens, Fellows, and Ap prentices. V. Of the Management of the Craft in w orking. VI. Of Behavior. viz: 1. In the Lodge while constitute 2. After the Lodge is over and the Bre thren not gone. 3. When Brethren meet without Stranger s, but not in a Lodge. 4. In presence of Strangers not Masons . 5. At home and in the neighborhood. 6. Toward a strange Brother. I. Concerning God and Religion A Mason is oblig'd by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be found a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancien t Times Masons were charged in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, 'yet 'tis now thought m ore expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all men ag ree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves; that is, to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasio ns they may be distinguish'd; whereby Masonry becomes the Center o f Union, and the means of conciliating true friendship among persons who must otherwise have remained at a perpetual Distance. II. Of the Civil Magistrate Supreme and Subordinate A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works, and never to be concerned in Plot s and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself G.L. Code R 2/20/06 88 undutifully to inferior Magistrates; for as Masonry hath been always injured by war, Bloodshed, and Confusion, so ancien t Kings and Princes have been much dispos'd to encourage the Cr aftsmen, because of their Peaceableness and Loyalty, whereby they pr actically answer'd the Cavils of their Adversaries and promoted the Ho nour of the Fraternity who ever flourish'd in Times of Peace. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State, he is not to b e countenanc'd in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy M an; but, if convicted of no other crime, though the loyal Broth erhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time b eing, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his relations to it r emain indefeasible. III. Of Lodges A Lodge is a place where Masons assemble and work: Hence that Assembly, or duly organiz'd Society of Masons, is c all'd a Lodge, and every Brother ought to belong to one, and to be sub ject to its By-laws and General Regulations. It is either particular o r general and will be best understood by attending it, and by the Regulat ions of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annex'd. In ancient Times, no Master or Fellow could be absent from it, especially when war n’d to appear at it, without incurring a severe Censure, until it appear ’d to the Master and Wardens that pure Necessity indeed him. The Persons admitted Members of a Lodge must be goo d and true Men, free-born, and of mature and discreet Age, no Bondmen, no Women, no immoral or scandalous Men, but of good Re port. IV. Of Masters, Wardens, Fellows, and Apprentices All preferment among Masons is grounded upon real W orth and personal Merit only; that so the Lords may be well served. the Brethren not put to shame, nor the Royal Craft desp is'd: Therefor no Master or Warden is chosen by Seniority, but for hi s Merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every Brother must attend in his Place, and learn them in a way peculi ar to this Fraternity. Only Candidates may know, that no Master should tak e an Apprentice, unless he has sufficient Imployment for him. and unless he be a perfect Youth, having no Maim or Defect in his Body, that may render him uncapable of learning the Art of ser ving his Master’s"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" G.L. Code R 2/20/06 89 Lord, and of being made a Brother, and then a Fello w-Craft in due time, even after he has served such a Term of Years as the Custom of the Country directs; and that he should be descende d of honest Parents; that so, when otherwise qualify'd he may a rrive to the Honour of being the Warden, and then the Master of the Lod ge the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Master of all the L odges, according to his Merit. No Brother can be a Warden until he has pass'd the part of a Fellow- Craft; nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand Warden until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor Grand Mast er unless he has been a Fellow-Craft before his Election, who is als o to be nobly born, or a Gentleman of the best Fashion, or some eminent Scholar, or some curious Architect, or other Artist, descended of ho nest Parents, and who is of singular great Merit in the Opinion of th e Lodges. And for the better, and easier, and more honourable Dischar ge of his Office, The Grand-Master has a Power to choose his own Depu ty Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerl y, the Master of a particular Lodge, and has the Privilege of acting whatever the Grand Master, his Principal, should act, unless the said Principal be present, or interpose his Authority by a letter. These Rulers and Governors, supreme and subordinate , of the ancient Lodge, am to be obey'd in their respective Stations by all the Brethren, according to the old Charges and Regulati ons, with all Humility, Reverence, Love, and Alacrity. V. Of the Management of the Craft In Working All Masons shall work honestly on working Days, tha t they may live creditably on holy Days; and the time appointed by the Law of the Land, or confirm’d by Custom, shall be observ’d. The most expert of the Fellow-Craftsmen shall be ch osen or appointed the Master, or Overseer of the Lord's Wor k; who is to be call’ d Master by those that work under him. The Cr aftsmen are to avoid all ill Language, and to call each other by n o disobliging Name, but Brother or Fellow; and to behave themselves cou rteously within and without the Lodge. The Master, knowing himself to be able of Cunning, shall undertake the Lord's Work as reasonably as possible, and trul y dispend his G.L. Code R 2/20/06 90 Goods as if they were his own; nor to give more Wag es to any Brother or Apprentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons receiving their Wage s, justly, shall be faithful to the Lord, and honestly finish their Work, whether Task or, Journey; nor put the Work to Task that hath bee n accustom'd to Journey. None shall discover Envy at the Prosperity of a Bro ther, nor supplant him, or put him out of his Work, if he be capable t o finish the same; for no Man can finish another's Work so much to the Lord's Profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the Designs and Draughts of him that began it. When a Fellow-Craftsman is chosen Warden of the Wor k under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fellows , shall carefully oversee the Work in the Master's Absence to the Lor d's profits; and his Brethren shall obey him. All Masons employ'd shall meekly receive their Wage s without Murmuring or Mutiny, and not desert the Master till the Work is finish'd. A Younger Brother shall be instructed in working to prevent spoiling the Materials for want of Judgment, and for increas ing and continuing of Brotherly Love. All the Tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge. No labourer shall be employ'd in the proper Work of Masonry; nor shall Free Masons work with those that are not free , without an urgent Necessity; nor shall they teach Labourers and unacc epted Masons, as they should teach a Brother or Fellow. VI. Of Behavior, viz. 1. In the Lodge While Constituted. You are not to hold private Committees, or separate Conversation, without leave from the Master, nor to talk of anyth ing impertinent or unseemingly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, o r any Brother"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" G.L. Code R 2/20/06 91 speaking to the Master: Nor behave yourself ludicro usly or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and s olemn; nor use any unbecoming Language upon any Pretense whatsoever; b ut to pay due Reverence to your Masters, Wardens, and Fellows, an d put them to worship. If any Complaint be brought, the Brother found guil ty shall stand to the Award and Determination of the Lodge, who are t he proper and competent Judges of all such Controversies (unless you carry it by Appeal to the Grand Lodge), and to whom they ought to be referr'd, unless a Lord's Work be hindered the meanwhile, in which Case a particular Reference may be made; but you must neve r go to Law about what concerneth Masonry, without an absolute Necessity apparent to the Lodge. 2. Behavior After The Lodge Is Over and The Brethr en Not Gone. You may enjoy yourselves with innocent Mirth, treat ing one another according to Ability, but avoiding all Excess, or f orcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his Inclination, or hinderin g him from going when his Occasions call him, or doing or saying any thing offensive, or that may forbid an easy and free Conservation; f or that would blast our Harmony, and defeat our laudable Purpose. There fore no private Piques or Quarrels must be brought within the Door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about Religion, or Nations, or st ate Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholic Religion above men tion’d; we are also of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds, and Languag es, and are resolved against all Politics, as what never yet co nduc'd to the Welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This Charge ha s been always strictly enjoin'd and observed; but especially ever since the Reformation in Britain, or the Dissent and Secessio n of these Nations from the Communion of Rome. 3. Behavior When Brethren Meet Without Strangers, B ut Not In a Lodge. You are to salute one another in a courteous manner , as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freely givi ng mutual Instructions as shall be thought expedient, without being overseen or overheard, and without encroaching upon each other, or derogating from that Respect which is due to any Brother, were he not a Mason: For though all Masons are as Brethren upon the same Level, yet G.L. Code R 2/20/06 92 Masonry takes no Honour from a Man that he had befo re; nay, rather it adds to his Honour, especially if he has deserve d well of the Brotherhood, who must give Honour to whom it is due , and avoid ill Manners. 4. Behavior in Presence of Strangers not Masons. You shall be cautious in your Words and Carriage, t hat the most penetrating Stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and sometimes you shall divert a discourse, and manage it prudently for the Honour o f the worshipful Fraternity. 5. Behavior At Home, and In Your Neighborhood. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise Man; par ticularly not to let your family, Friends, and neighbors know the Co ncerns of the Lodge, &c., but wisely to consult your own Honour, and that of the ancient Brotherhood, for Reasons not to be mentione d here. You must also consult your Health, by not continuing togethe r too late, or too long from home, after Lodge Hours are past; and by avoiding of Gluttony or Drunkenness, that your Families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working. 6. Behavior Towards a Strange Brother. You are cautiously to examine him, in such a Method as Prudence shall direct you, that you may not be impos'd upon by an ignorant false Pretender, whom you are to reject with Contem pt and Derision, and beware of giving him Hints of Knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Br other, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how be may be reliev'd: You must employe him some Days, or else recommend him to be employ'd. But you are not charged to do beyond your Ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, that is a good Man and true, before any ot her poor People in the same Circumstances. Finally, all these Charges you are to observe, and also those that shall be communicated to you in another way; cultivating Brotherly Love, the Foundation and Cape-stone, the Cement and Glory of this ancient Fraternity, avoiding all Wrangling and Quarrelling, all Slander and"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" G.L. Code R 2/20/06 93 Backbiting, nor permitting others to slander any ho nest Brother, but defending his Character, and doing him all good Off ices, its far as is consistent with your Honour and Safety, and no fart her. And if any of them do you Injury, you must apply to your own or h is Lodge; and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge at t he Quarterly Communication, and from thence to the annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable Conduct of our Fore-fathe rs in every Nation; never taking a legal Course, but when the C ase cannot be otherwise decided, and patiently listening to the h onest and friendly Advice of Master and Fellows, when they would preve nt your going to Law with Strangers, or would excite you to put a speedy Period to all Law-Suits, that so you may mind the Affair of M asonry with more Alacrity and Success; but with respect to Brother o r Fellows at Law, the Master and Brethren should kindly offer their M ediation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the contendi ng Brethren; and if that submission is impracticable, they must howe ver carry on their Process, or Law-Suits, without Wrath and Rancor (no t in the common way), saying or doing nothing which may hinder Brot herly Love, and good Offices to be renew'd and continu'd; that all may see the benign Influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the Beginning of the World, and will do to the End of t ime. Amen, so mote it be     We owe this famous version of the Old (charges to t he fact that His Grace The Duke of Montagu, Grand Master 1721-2, fou nd fault with the manuscript versions of the Constitutions (I. e. Legendary History of the Fraternity) previously in use, and ordered R ev.

Code R 2/20/06 95 The Masonic Foundation Of Utah The Masonic Foundation of Utah, authorized by Grand Lodge at its Fifty-Seventh Annual Communication, was Incorporate d under the laws of Utah, February 13, 1929. It is a Nonprofit , tax exempt Corporation, under the Internal Revenue Code. The Foundation is an arm of Grand Lodge composed of all members entitled to vote in Grand Lodge, with responsibilit y for the management of its business and accomplishment of it s intentions entrusted to, and imposed upon, a Board of Trustees . These are the Grand Master and Grand Secretary, during their term of office, and three others elected from the membership of Grand L odge, one each year at the Annual Communication for a three year t erm. This Board is charged with faithful performance of all duties related to the Foundation, receipts of funds, investment thereof a nd carrying out the objectives for which the Foundation was organized. The Tax Reform Act of 1969 and subsequent amendment s as passed by Congress places strict guidelines on the operati on and distribution of income of public and private Foundations. The r egulations, as promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, requir e that income be distributed only to qualified nonprofit, tax exempt organizations for philanthropic, charitable, or educational purposes. Any distribution to non-qualified organizations or individuals is stric tly prohibited and places severe penalties on the Trustees as well as the Foundation. This, the Tax Reform Act, limits some of the origin al purposes of the Foundation. Distributions to Masonic Lodges, Mason ic related organizations, or individual Masons are considered \"Self Dealing,\" and would invoke the aforementioned penalties. Des pite these limitations, the Foundation is accomplishing a trem endous amount of relief to the distressed and educational opportunit ies to our youth throughout this jurisdiction. Initially our capitalization in 1929 came from the Grand Lodge charity fund of $16,296.60. The fund was maintained by appropriating, at each Annual Communication of Gran d Lodge a sum of not to exceed 10% of its annual receipts. At th e 1972 Annual Communication of Grand Lodge it was suggested that the annual 10% be dropped and it has not been collected since. The dedicated support of Masons has resulted in a s teady growth of G.L. Code R 2/20/06 96 the Foundation's assets and made it unnecessary to access or appropriate funds from constituent Lodges. Response to the Grand Master's appeal each year has been generous and substantial funds have come from bequests, memo rials, wills and trusts. Every Utah Mason should be proud of this charitable Foundation which can be important to the future of our Fratern ity. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" G.L.

INFORMATION FOR APPLICANT The question of becoming a Freemason is a matter for very serious consideration and since you have expressed desire to be a member, we deem it advisable that you should be informed on certain points which may affect your decision to apply. In all ages Freemasonry has insisted that men sh ould come to its doors unsolicited and entirely of their own free will and accord. Mor eover, those joining in the hope of selfish personal gain will be bitterly disappointed . Freemasonry has for its foundation the great bas ic principles of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. No Atheist can be m ade a Mason. Freemasonry is not in any way an insurance Socie ty nor does it provide benefits in case of sickness or death.

The Master may then direct the withdrawal of the petition, as provided by Section 3-7-8, G. L. Code.

Code R 2/20/06 130 SUGGESTIONS TO INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE The best interests of the Masonic Fraternity d emand a prompt and careful investigation of the character and standing of those seeking admissions. Many points other than those listed he re will suggest themselves to you in your investigation. A personal interview with the applicant is des irable. It is proper either to call on him or to ask him to get in touch with you. Always contact his recommenders and those to w hom he refers. Satisfy yourself of his mental and physical ab ility to earn a livelihood, to conform substantially to the ceremon ies and to be instructed in the mysteries of Masonry. Check carefully on his residence. One may hav e been employed and lived in the city for more than six months and yet not have established “legal residence.” Grand Lodge Code, S ec. 3-16-12: “the residence of an applicant for the Degree is defined to be his permanent settled domicile, or fixed abode, from ch oice; and , as a rule, is identical with his legal residence.” Ascertain his credit standing if possible. Is he a man of his word? Is he intemperate or an habitual gambler? Make a g eneral inquiry among his friends, neighbors, and business associat es. If married, is applicant living with and suppo rting his family? Does his wife approve the idea of his entering the Fraternity? Not always will it be found necessary to interview the wife but in some cases it may be essential. Use your judgment after the interview with applicant. If his parents are living, what is thei r attitude in the matter? Usually this can be determined by questioning the a pplicant. It is essential to know his belief in a Suprem e Being. If the applicant has resided in other parts of this state or within the past few years resided in another state, the first named on the committee should write or contact the Secretary of the Lodge there for a report on his character, and previous conduct.
