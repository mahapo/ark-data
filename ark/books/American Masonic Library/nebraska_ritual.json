The Twenty-four Inch Gauge is an instrument made use of by operative masons, to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is em - blematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts; whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother; eight hours for our usual vocations; and eight for refresh - ment and sleep. The Common Gavel is an instrument made use of by operative masons, to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our minds and con - sciences of all the vices and superfluities of life; thereby fitting us, as living stones, for that spiri - tual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

The greatest of these is charity; for our faith may be lost in sight, hope ends in fruition; but charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. The furniture of a lodge is the Holy Bible, Square, and Compass. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God, the Square to the Master, and the Compass to the Craft. The Holy Bible i~ dedicated to God because it is the inestimable gift of God to man, and on it w oblgt a nwlyadmttd br; the Square to the 47 46"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Master because it is the proper Masonic em - blem of his office; and the Compass to the Craft, because by a due attention to its use they are taught to circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds. The ornaments of a lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blaz - ing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representa - tion of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple, the Indented Tessel, that beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematic of hu - man life, checkered with good and evil. The beautiful border which surrounds it, those mani - fold blessings and comforts which surround us; and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hiero - glyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. A lodge has three lights. They are situated in the East, West, and South. There is none in the North because of the situation of King Solomon’s Temple, it being situated so far north of the eclyptic that the Sun or Moon at their meridian height, could dart no rays into the north part thereof. The North, therefore, we Masonically term a place of darkness. 48 I A lodge has six jewels, three immovable and three movable. The immoVable jewels are the Square, Level, and Plumb, @ r win by 41 (.L) (i~•, ~ @ J ~)s as jwls % thr offc. The Square teaches morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of life. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state; the Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman to be adjusted by the tools of the fellow craft; the Trestle Board is for the master workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar, we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ash lar, that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive, by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle Board, we are reminded that as the operative workman erects his temporal build - ing agreeable to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his Trestle Board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the great books of 49"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"nature and revelation, which are our spiritual, moral, and Masonic Trestle Board.

In ancient times lodges were dedicated to Solomon, King of Israel, because he was our first Most Excellent Grand Master. Masons professing Christianity, dedicate theirs to Saint John the Baptist, and Saint John the Evange - list, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry, and since their time there is represented in every regular and well governed lodge, a certain Point within a Circle; the Point representing an individual brother, the Circle representing the boundary line of his duty to God and man, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, prejudices, or interests to betray him on any occasion. This Circle is embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing Saint 50 John the Baptist and Saint John the Evange - list, who were perfect parallels in Christianity as well as Masonry, and upon the vertex rests the book of Holy Scriptures, which points out the whole duty of man. In going round this circile we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially err. The three great tenets of Masonic profession are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. BROTHERLY LOVE By the exercise of brotherly love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family, the high and low, the rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support and protect each other. On this prin - ciple, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friend - ship among those who might otherwise have remained at a pei 2 petual distance. 51"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"RELIEF To relieve the distressed, is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. TRUTH Truth is a divine attribute, and the founda - tion of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates en - deavor to regulate our conduct; hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and de - ceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain - dealingdistinguishus, andtheheartand tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity.

No institution was ever raised on a better principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are incul - cated in the several Masonic lectures. The great - est and best of men, in all ages, have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assem - blies. There are three great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate — to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never mentioning His name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable under - takings, and to esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you. And to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your fac - ulties or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the state, you are to be a quiet and peaceful subject, true to your governments and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. My brother, I would that you could fully realize what it is to be without a family, without a home, and without a country. And if you ever are tempted to say a word, or to do a thing that should put a bar between you and your family, your home, and your country, pray God in His mercy to take you that instant home to His own heaven. Stickbyyourfamily, mybrothefl forget you have a self, while you do everything for them. Think of your home, my brother; write and send and talk about it. Let it be nearer and nearer to your thought the farther you have to travel from it; and rush back to it when you are free. And for your country, my brother, and for 57 56"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"that flag--never dream a dream but of serving her as she bids you, though the service carry you through a thousand hells. No matter what hap - pens to you, no matter who flatters you or who abuses you, never look at another flag, never let a night pass but you pray God to bless that flag. Remember, my brother, that behind all these men you have to do with, behind officers and government, and people even, there is the Coun - try Herself, your Country, and that you belong to Her as you belong to your own mother. Stand by her, my brother, as you would stand by your mother! In your outward demeanor, be particularly care - ful to avoid censure or reproach. Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity, or influence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into argument with those who, through igno - rance, may ridicule it. r At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give as you will be ready to receive instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mys - teries of the order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly careful not to recommend him un - less you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. ~) * (Seat lodge.) 58 59"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":".~d%.NJ.LJ~ I ~E~r~),* ~ ~~ flthng frthr in -H ~), ~) Cr~.

OPERATIVE MASONRY By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will result a due pro - portion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings, and con - venient shelters from the vicissitudes and in- clemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the I choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and indus - try is implanted in man for the best, most salutary, and beneficent purposes. SPECULATIVE MASONRY By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, actupon the square, keep atongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion, as to lay us under obligation to pay that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the con - templative Mason to view, with reverence and admiration, the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator.

The principal use of the Globes, besides serv - ing as maps to distinguish the outward parts of the earth, and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and explainthe phenomena arising from the annual revolution and the diurnal rotation of the earth around its own axis. They are the noblest instruments for improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or proposition, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and His works, and are induced to encourage the studies of astronomy, geography, naviga - tion, and the arts dependent upon them, by which society has been so much benefitted.

By Order in Architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a build - ing, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. (ITS ANTIQUITY) From the first formation of society, Order in Architecture may be traced. When the rigor of the seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The 96 bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint, originally, proceeded the more im - proved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. THE TUSCAN The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and entabulature have but few moldings. The sim - plicity of the construction of this column ren - ders it eligible where ornament would be super - fluous. THE DORIC The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, ex - cept moldings; though the frieze is distinguished 97"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE CORINTHIAN by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs com - pose the ornaments of the frieze. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is com - posed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are chiefly required. THE IONIC The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high, its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has den - tils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity dis - played in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the famous temple of Diana at Ephesus was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young woman, of an elegant shape, dressed in her hair, as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man. The Corinthian, the richest of the five or - ders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentils and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth, by Callimachus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the follow - ing remarkable circumstance. Accidently pass - ing by the tomb of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys covered by a tile placed over an acanthus root, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encom - passed the basket, till, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with the object, set about imitating the figure; the vase of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus, the tile; and the volutes, the bending leaves. 99 F 98"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE COMPOSITE The Composite is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has quarter rounds, as the Tuscan and Doric orders; is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentils or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. Three orders, alone, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other. The two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally; the Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. Of these five orders, the Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian, as the most ancient, are most es - teemed by Masons. The Ionic, from the skill and ingenuity displayed in its construction, is em - blematic of the column of Wisdom, which is situated in the east part of the lodge, and is represented by the Worshipful Master; the Doric, from the massive strength of its struc - ture, is emblematic of the column of Strength, 1’ which is situated in the west part of the lodge, and is represented by the Senior Warden; and the Corinthian, from the exuberance of its ornaments, is emblematic of the column of Beauty, which is situated in the south part of the lodge, and is represented by the Junior Warden.

HEARING Hearing is that sense by which we distin - guish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. We are endowed with hearing, that by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be com - plete. SEEING Seeing is that sense by which we distinguish objects. Nay, more; by it we perceive the tem - pers and dispositions, the passions and affec - tions of our fellow creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the 100 101"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. FEELING Feeling is that sense by which we distin - guish the different qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, rough - ness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion, and extension. SMELLING Smelling is that sense by which we distin - guish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Hence, it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the Great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in respiration. I TASTING Tasting enables us to make a proper distinc - tion in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Smelling and tasting are inseparably con - nected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, thatthese senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices. On the mind, all our knowledge must de - pend; what therefore can be a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons? By anatomical dissection and observation, we be - come acquainted with the body; but, it is by the anatomy of the mind alone, we discover its powers and principles. To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God’s bounty to man, we shall add that memory, imagination, taste, reasoning, moral perception, and all the active powers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field for 102 103"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"philosophical disquisition, which far exceed human inquiry, and are peculiar mysteries, known only to nature and to nature’s God, to whom we are all indebted for creation, preser - vation, and every blessing we enjoy. )(mg, sng ~ fing in inst invind by (r~sns; fin by -H sns % hrng, w dstngsh 41 wind; by tht % sng, w prcv 41 sgn; by tht % fing, w rcgnze 41 grp whrby one(~myknwanthrrn-Hdrkaswllasrn-Hlght.

GRAMMAR Grammar teaches the proper arrangement of words according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people; and that excellency of pro - nunciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeable to reason and correct usage. RHETORIC Rhetoric teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with propri - ety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance; wisely contriving to captivate the hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether itbe to entreat and exhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC Logic teaches us to guide our reason discretionally inthe general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce, and conclude, according to certain pre - mises laid down, admitted, or granted; and, in it, are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning, and disposing all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally determined. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation, or groundwork~ of our inquiries; particularlY in the pursuit of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons.

GEOMETRY Geometry treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered, from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure, or an indivisible part of space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity; namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions; namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions; namely, length breadth, and thickness. In fine, geometry is the foundation of architecture, and the root of math - ematics. MUSIC Music teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose delightful harmony, by a mathemati - cal and proportional arrangement of acute, grave, and mixed sounds. ASTRONOMY Astronomy is that divine art by which we are taught toread the wisdom, strength, andbeauty of the Almighty Creator in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere. While we are em - ployed in the study of this science, we must perceive unparalleled instances of wisdom and goodness and, through the whole creation, trace the glorious Author by His works. 41 ffth scnc, or (~mtry is inst invind by (r~sns. pssng -H stins w nw amy at 41 otin din 41 inddl chmbr, whch w fnd dly grdd by 41 J ~) wh wll dmnd us -H ~55 ~tkn 41 PSS aT (~.

Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Masonry is erected. By geometry, we may curi - ously trace Nature, through her various wind - ings, to her most concealed recesses. By it we discover the power, the wisdom, and the good - ness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which con - nect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their different orbits and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of seasons and the vari - ety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by~the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all con - ducted by the same unerring law of Nature. 110 111"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A survey of Nature, and the observations of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the divine plan and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have pro - duced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of igno - rance, and the devastations of war have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. Tools and implements of ar - chitecture are selected by the Fraternity to im - print on the memory wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, are transmit - ted unimpaired the excellent tenets of our insti - tution.

The internal, and not the external quali - fications of a man, are what Masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Mason, you are bound to discharge; or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adher - ence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenu - ously to support; and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate, or aggravate the offenses of your breth - ren; but, in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admon - ish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly rec - ommended to your consideration; especially the science of geometry, which is established as 4 I, I the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the wonderful properties of Nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new character it is ex - pected that you will conform to the principles of the order, by steadily persevering in the prac - tice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagements as a Fellow Craft Mason, and to these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties. 124 125"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"AJIJ L±’~ ‘~7 ~9r, *i5t~flytjij~igfrthi.in.4~)tcmbfr ths :: ? ~): flthng frthr in -H ~), ~) (T~• (Senior Warden sits.) ~..t) (i~: * (Junior Warden rises.)

This famous fabric was supported by fourteen hundred and fifty-three columns, and two thousand nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. There were employed in its building, three Grand Masters, three thousand and three hun - dred Masters, or overseers of the work; eighty thousand Fellow Crafts; and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices, or bearers of burdens. All these were classed and arranged in such a manner, by the wisdom of Solomon, that neither envy, discord, nor confusion were suffered to interrupt that universal peace and tranquility which per - vaded the world at this important period. There are in this degree two classes of emblems or symbols, the first of which consists of: The Three Steps, The Pot of Incense, The Beehive, The Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s Sword, The Sword pointing to a Naked Heart, The All-seeing Eye, The Anchor and Ark, The Forty-Seventh Problem of Euclid, The Hourglass, and The Scythe. F F I I C I The three steps, usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet, are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life; namely, Youth, Manhood, and Age. InYouth, as Entered Apprentice Masons, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as Fellow Craft Ma - sons, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbors and ourselves; that so, in Age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflec - tions consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. THE POT OF INCENSE The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sac - rifice to the Diety; and, as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent Author of our existence, for the manifold bless - ings and comforts we enjoy. 195 194"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"I I I THE BEEHIVE The Beehive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that, as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down, contented, while our fellow creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve them. When we take a survey of nature, we view man, in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brutal creation; he lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, or of shelter - ing himself from the inclemencies of the weather. Thus, was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons. I t I I I THE BOOK OF CONSTITIYrIONS, GUARDED BY THE TYLER’S SWORD The Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s sword, reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words, arid actions; particularly, when before the enemies of Masonry; ever bearing in re - membrance, those truly Masonic virtues, Si - lence and circumspection. THE SWORD POINTING TO A NAKED HEART The Sword Pointing to a Naked Heart, demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and, although 0~~~~ ought5,words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of men, yet that All Seeing Eye, whom the sun, moon, and stars obey, and under whose watchful care even comets perform their stupendous revolu - tions, pervades the inmost recesses of the hu - man heart, and will reward us according to our merits. 197 I 196"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE ANCHOR AND ARK The Anchor and Ark are emblems of a well grounded hope and a well spent life. They are emblematical of that Divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that Anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary shall find rest. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID The Forty-Seventh problem of Euclid was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythagoras, who in his trav - els through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initi - ated into several orders of priesthood and raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and, more especially, in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theo - rems; and, among the most distinguished, he erected this, when, in the joy of his heart, he I exclaimed, ~Eureka” in the Grecian language, signifying “I have found it;” and, upon the discovery of which, he is said to have sacrificed a hundred head of cattle. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. THE HOUR-GLASS The Hourglass is an emblem of human life. Behold! How swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close. We cannot, without astonishment, behold the little particles which are contained in this machine; how they pass away almost imperceptibly; and, yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus, wastes man! Today, he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing hon - ors thick upon him; the next day, comes a frost, which nips the shoot; and, when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. 198 199"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE SCYTHE The Scythe is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life and launches us into eternity. Behold! What havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race! If, by chance, we should escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor, arrive at the years of manhood; yet withal, we must soon be cut down by the all devouring scythe of time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us. My brother, the second, or last, class of Masonic emblems consists of the Setting Maul, the Spade, the Coffin, and the Sprig of Acacia. The Setting Maul, wth whch our $ (7’~ )(rm Abf ws sin, reminds us of that disease or casualty which will soon terminate our lives. The Spade, tht dg lis grv, reminds us of that spade which will soon dig our graves. The Cof - fin, tht rcvd hs rmns, reminds us of that coffin which will soon receive these frail bodies of ours. And the Sprig of Acacia that bloomed, at the lid % lis grv, @ ws -H cs % its tinly dscvry, is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. The Setting Maul, the Spade and the Coffin are striking emblems of mortality, and afford serious reflections to a thinking mind, and they would be more gloomy and serious still, were it not for the Sprig of Acacia that blooms at the head of the grave, and serves to remind us of that imperishable part within which survives the grave, and bears the nearest affinity to the Supreme Intelligence which per - vades all nature, and which can never, never, never die. The Acacia, my brother, may soon des - ignate your last resting place in that haven of rest, that silent abode, that peaceful home, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. My brother, be ever mindful of that great change, when you will be called from your labors on earth to everlasting re - freshment in the Paradise of God. Let me ad - monish you, in the most solemn manner, in reference to the close of life, that, when the cold winter of death shall have passed, and the bright summer morn of the resurrection ap - pears; when the Son of Righteousness shall descend and send forth His Angels to collect the ransomed dead; then, if you are found worthy, by the benefit of having lived a pure and blame- 200 201"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"less life, with a firm reliance on Ulvine Frovi - dence, you shall receive a ready admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe forever presides and forever reigns. Then shall you see the King in the beauty of His Holiness, and with Him enter into an endless eternity. Thus, my brother, we close our lecture on the emblems, with the solemn thought of death. We are all born to die. We follow our friends to the brink of the grave, and, standing on the shore of a vast and boundless ocean, we gazewith exquisite anxiety untilthe laststruggle is over, and we see them sink into the fathom - less abyss. We feel our own feet slipping from the precarious brink on which we stand. A few more rolling suns and we, too, will be ‘whelmed, ‘neath death’s awful wave, to rest in its stilly shades; and darkness and silence will reign around our melancholy abode. W M: *** (The lecturer moves to the northeast corner of the Altar and the Senior Deacvn con - ducts the candidate to the west of theAltar.) But is this the end of man, and the aspiring hopes of faithful Masons? No, bless God, we pause not at the first or second step; but, true to our prin - ciples, look forward for greater Light; and as the embers of mortality are faintly glimmering in their sockets of existence, the Bible removes the dark cloud, draws aside the sable curtains of the tomb, bids hope and joy arouse us; cheers and sustains the departing spirit. It points beyond the grave and bids us turn our eyes with faith and confidence upon the opening scenes of eter - nity. And now, my brethren, let us see to it, and so regulate our lives by the Plumb Line of Justice and Truth, squaring our actions by the Square of virtue, so that when the summons for our departure comes, we shall be found ready. Let us practice assiduously, the noble tenets of our profession, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. From the Square, let us learn morality; from the Level, equality; and from the Plumb, rectitude of life. Let us imitate him, who, when assailed by a mrdrs bnd of rbllus crftsmn, maintained his integrity even to death, and sealed his pledge with his own blood. Let us emulate his amiable and virtuous conduct; his unfeigned piety to God; his inflexible fidelity to his trust; and, as the evergreen tht blind at the hd of hs grv, btknd the plc of his intrmnt, so may virtue’s ever blooming lbveliness designate us as An - cient, Free and Accepted Masons. 202 1: 203"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Finally, my brethren, let us all keep in memory this solemn truth; we know not how soon the hour of our dissolution may come, when the cold winds of death are sighing around us, and their chilly dews glisten on our fore - heads; for man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble; he cometh forth as a flower and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not; in the midst of life we are in death. A firm belief in the truths revealed in this Sacred Volume, and a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, will afford us consolation in that dark and gloomy hour, and will insure us an eternal and ineffable happi - ness in the world to come. ~ 4 L)(~: E)r~ ~dnddt-Hbrt-HEtrdv-t1(i~hrg, whch wll b gvn by ~)r . ***(Raises the Lodge and unwuers.)
