All old re ferences to the Royal Arch were invariably to the \"Excellent Super Excellent Royal Arch Masons,\" which com prised three grades. The Supe r Excellent has long since been discontinued, save in the veil-working of Irish Royal Arch Chapters, while the Excellent Master is a predicate to the Royal Arch in the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapters of Scotland and is worked in English Councils of Royal & Select Master The other degr ees, likewise, were worked in Craft Lodges in both Am erica and the British Isles. When Freem asonry discontinued the working of outsi de degrees, these degrees became practically dorm ant, although they were perpetuated and finally form ed their own suprem e heads, in m any instances. They were finally grouped together under a governing head and hence the title of \"Allied Masonic Degrees;\" they have been allied together for mutual benefit and perpetuation. The working of these degrees in America is encouraged, but not required; the blanket obligation of the Council binding the newly invited brother sufficiently. Where it is possible, Grand Council recom mends that som e of the degrees be worked each year in order that the memb ers may be fully inform ed as to the working. Mem bership in an Allied Council is lim ited by law to twenty-seven, and then only by i nvitation. It is predicated upon Royal Arch Masonry. Officers of a Council are the sam e as of a Craft Lodge, although the opening and closing cerem onies m ust rem ain true to the form prescribed. 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"An Explanation of the Allied Masonic Degrees The Allied Masonic Degrees are de tached degrees som e of which, m any years ago, were conferred under Craft wa rrants and form ed part of the then loosely governed Freem asonry of the period. Many of these detached degrees becam e dorm ant in som e pl aces, although in others they were conferred as side degrees. In tim e, the better of these degrees were grouped together in an organized body under th e title of the Allied Masonic Degrees. The degrees comprising the system in our jurisdiction in the USA are the Royal Ark Mariner, Secret Monitor, Knight of Constantinople, Saint Lawrence the Martyr, Architect, Grand Architect, Superintendent, Grand Tyler of Solom on, Master of Tyre, Excellent Master, Installed Sovereign Master, Installed Commander Noah, Red Branch of Eri, and Ye Antient and Olde Order of Corks. In addition, othe r dorm ant degrees m ay be added if the Grand Council decides to append them to the system . These degrees are conferred in the United States in Councils, chartered by the Grand Council of the AMD. Each Council is lim ited to twenty-seven m embers, with two exceptions. One of these exceptions is known as the Council of the Nine Muse #13 and it is lim ited to nine m embers. The other exception is Grand Master' s Council, A which has what is known as a \"roving Charter\". The purpose of the latter Council is to pr ovide a place of m embership in the Allied Masonic Degrees for brethren residing in localities where Councils have not been organized. Mem bership in this Council, as well as every other Council of the Allied Masonic Degrees is by invitation only, and is predicated on membership in a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons. In addition to perpetuating these degrees, there is another and equally im portant purpose to the AMD. It brings together in sm all groups Freem asons who are interested in the advancement of a ll branches of Masonry, preparing them selves to better serve the Cr aft through the m edium of study and research. By lim iting the m embership in a Council and acquiring m embers only by invitation, the result is a congenial group able to enjoy full fellowship when m eeting together. Wher ever there is an active Council of the Allied Masonic Degrees, it exerts an influence for the betterm ent of Freem asonry in all of the Masonic bodies of the area. There is no intent on the part of the Allied Masonic Degrees to detract from any organized and established body of Masonry. On th e contrary, you will find our m embers active beyond the average in all local Masonic bodies. The real purpose of AMD is to stim ulate interest in Freem asonry in general and bring together in sm all groups those who are interested in the study of Masonic subjects. 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Thus, the members are better enabled to se rve the Craft.

It has m ade an appearance in 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"several rites and is known throughout the English speaking world of Freem asonry. It is always \"m oored\" to another body; in England to the Grand Lodge of Mark Masters, in Scotland to the Suprem e Grand Royal Arch Chapter, in Canada to the Gra nd Council of Royal & Select Masters and in the United States to the AMD. It was revived in the US in 1892 with the establishm ent of the Sovereign Co llege of Allied Mas onic and Christian Degrees, using a slightly different r itual. With the institution of the US AMD in 1932 by three RAM Lodges char tered by Scotland and the \"union\" with the Sovereign College, the Gr and Council AMD now controls bodies using both rituals. This is the Sco ttish ritual of the Degree. The Grand Council AMD has institute d several Royal Ark Ma riner Lodges, which according to local usage, m ay initiate non-AMD Royal Arch Masons into this degree.

It is us ually given at the door of the Lodge, and hence is called the Pass Sign. The third is the Sign of the Dove, it is given thus, by closing down the 3rd,4th and 5th fingers of the right hand, extending the arm , thum b and forefinger, and refers to Noah exte nding his hand for the dove; it is usually accompanied with the words \"Lo, she cometh\". The fourth is the Penal Sign, it is give n the right hand in the sam e m anner as in the Sign of the Dove and drawing back the arm quickly so as to strike the short rib with the elbow. In doing so, the grand word \"El Elion\" is som etim es given. This Sign refers to Noah while hurriedly pulling in his hand with the dove, striking his short rib with his elbow.

The Grip is given thus by grasping the hands tightly as in the Pass Grip of the Mark Degree, but with the thum b placed over the knuckles. It refers to the Antediluvians sentenced to the wate ry abyss, and struggling against the execution of that sentence, endeavouring to frustrate the wrath of Heaven by pulling each other up to the summits of hills, tops of trees, and all other places that presented a temporary re lief from the justice of Him who was then pouring down destruction upon thei r heads. Hence it is som etim es called the Token of Distress. The Pass Word is \"Methuselah, Lamech, Jared\". The Word of recognition is \"Noah, Shem, Japhet\". The Grand Word is \"El Elion\".

You, m y brother have this evening been put to the sam e, test, and the excellent m anner in which you have acquitted yourself m eets with, our heartiest approbation.

(The candidate is conduc ted to the anteroom and shod; he is then reconducted to the east, and receives this lecture.) Lecture 2 Patriarch – Those of our ancient bret hren who attribute to Freem asonry a very great antiquity tell us that when , on account of the iniquities of m an, God determ ined to visit the earth with a deluge, Noah and his fam ily, am ong the m ale m embers of which the true Ma sonry existed, were saved form the destructive waters. Thus was the s ecret art preserved, and handed down through the ages to that m ost wise Grand Master, King Solom on, who will ever be esteemed by the Craft as the true patron of Freemasonry. The Masonry, however, of King Solom on bei ng of an architectural character and its sym bolical language derived from th e instrum ents of architecture, it was but natural that a degree so peculiar in its legend and sym bolism as that of the Ark and Dove, notwithstanding its great antiquity, should have becom e neglected am ongst the Jews, who were neve r, in the true se nse of the word, a maritim e people. We are therefore i ndebted, say our ancient brethren, for this degree to Hiram, King of Ty re, who had received his Masonic knowledge Independently of King Solom on and through a different channel. Tyre being a seaport, this degr ee was conferred upon m any seafaring— brethren, whence it is supposed the title Ark Mariner was derived. Through them and their successors the degree has com e down to later days. Presentation of Working Tools I now present you with the working tool s of Royal Ark Mariner. They are the axe, the auger and the saw. The axe is an instrument used to fell trees, and was em ployed by the patriarch Noah in preparing the tim bers for the building of the ark, but we as Ark Mariners use it for a m ore noble pur pose, to rem ind us that we ought to fell down from the very root all evil and corrupt habits within our souls, so that we m ay bear in our lives the fruits of righteousness. 38"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The auger is a tool for boring holes in planks, and was used by Noah and his sons when preparing their refuge from the waves, but we as Ark Mariners use it for the purpose of rem inding us th at, as through the holes m ade by the auger the pegs are placed to join the planks together, so it is by the rents that are m ade in our hearts by affliction th at we are m ore closely united to our brethren in sym pathetic friendship and brotherly love. The saw divides the tim ber into planks, a nd is said to have been used thus by Noah in the construction of the ark, but we use it for the m ore noble purpose of rem inding us that while we are all derived from the one great parent tree of hum anity, yet is each m an responsible for his own soul to God, and for work, sym pathy and help to his fellows. And, as the saw from the tree separates the plank, so ought we to be separated from the evil that is in the world, and live as good m en and true Masons. Equilateral Triangle But little rem ains, m y brother, for m e to say. The Equilateral Triangle, which is the peculiar sym bol of the degree of the Ark and Dove, deserves your careful consideration and thought. Its angles are Beauty, Strength and Wisdom, its sides, each equal to the ot her, represent God in His threefold relation of Self-existence, Revelation a nd Redemption.

So help m e God, and keep m e steadfast in this my solem n oath and obligation of a Secret Monitor. [1] - From 1831 ritual The signs, and also the words and tokens of this degree, are of two kinds, negatives and affirm atives. The negative sign is m ade by exhibiting two fingers (held aloft). It is given whenever you see a brother doing, or about to do anything contrary to his interest in buying or selling; it m eans desist; the brother who receives the sign, is bound by his oath to pause and reflect. The sign of approbation is given by holding up one finger. It is given whenever you wish secretly to advise a brother in any traffic or dealing to his profit and interest; it means proceed. Grips are given and received in the sam e adm onishing way. When you take the hand of a brother, if you grip him in the center of the hand, with two fingers, it m eans desist; if you grip with one finger, it m eans proceed. To caution a brother by word, if you see a brother doing anything contrary to his interest, in buying or selling, say to him , you had better buy two, \"two is better than one;\" it m eans desist. If you say to him , \"one is as good as two,\" it m eans proceed, and he will directly understand you, and act accordingly. Thus you can caution a brother by sign, token, or word, whenever you see him doing anything contrary to the princi ples of Masonry, or his interest; and he, so cautioned, is bound to pause and reflect, before he further goes, under the penalties of having the arrow of an enem y thrust through his heart 56"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" Then there is another way to caution a brother. If you say to him , \"the arrows are beyond thee;\" it m eans desist . If you say to him , \"the arrows are on this side of thee;\" it means proceed. The due-guard and sign of this degr ee is given by placing yourself in the attitude of springing a bow; it is in im itation of Jonathan shooting the arrows; it alludes to the penalty of the obligation. To answer this sign, strike the left side, opposite the heart, with the end of the fore finger of the left hand, the other fingers clenched.   57"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Brotherhood of David and Jonathan Order of the Secret Monitor (English ) 1 st Degree Officers needed for conferral: Cerem ony of Induction - 1 Supreme Ruler - in the East, center, facing West Counsellor - in the East, South of SR, facing North Guide - in the East, North of SR, facing South Director of Ceremonies - in the West 4 Visiting Deacons - corners of floorcloth facing Altar 1st - Southeast, 2nd - Southwest, 3rd - Northeast, 4th - Northwest Secretary - on the North side of room Guarder - near door Sentinel - outside door Equipment needed Floor cloth - About 8ft by 8ft square, red m aterial on which is a double triangle.

In 1875, Dr. I. Zach arie established the Am erican degree in England, where a Grand Council of the Order was form ed in 1887. This \"Grand Council of the Order of the Secr et Monitor, or Brotherhood of David and Jonathan, in the British Isles &c.\" rewrote and expanded the Am erican ritual into a system of two degrees and a \"chair\" degree, and has enjoyed a measure of success. It continues to exis t as a seperate Order in England and has created other District, Provincia l and Grand Councils of the Order around the world. An interesting feature of the \"English\" Secret Monitor is that the 4 Visiting Deacons are specifica lly charged to \"search out and warn any brother who m ay be exposed to dange r, whether secret or apparent, and to visit those afflicted with sickness or sorrow or otherwise in need of fraternal help and consolation.\" To acco mplish this end, the roster of the entire Conclave is divided am ong th em and each m ember appropriately contacted each term a number of times , with the results reported to the Conclave.

And when the lad was com e to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee ?

You will recoll ect that, in the passage of Scripture you have just heard, Jonathan was to m ake known to David his success, or want of success, by shooting Arrows on th is or that side of the Stone Ezel. Had the Arrows fallen on this side, the meaning would have been that David was to proceed to take his accustom ed place with the king's household; but the words \"The Arrows Are Beyond Thee\" signified that he m ust no longer seek the peace of home, but must become a fugitive, fleeing from the presence of his king, and leaving behind him fam ily and friends. From this circum stance is derived the passw ord of the first degree, Ez el , and so the words \"The Arrows are on this side of thee\", spoken by one Brother Secret Monitor to another, mean \"Proceed,\" while the words \"The Arrows are beyond thee\" m ean \"Desist\". To caution a Brother, if you see him doing, or about to do, anything contrary to the principles of Freem asonry, or against his own interests - By w ord - you m ay suggest that he should \"Take Two\" or that \"Two are better than one\" which m eans \"Desis t\"; on the other hand, if you would advise him to \"Proceed\" you m ay say \"One is as good as two\". 69"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"By sign - you m ay raise the left hand (clenc hed) to represent the Stone Ezel and signal on this side with one finge r or beyond with two fingers, with the meaning given in the previous explanation.

Explanation of the Weapons (SR or other Brother) The weapons of the Secret Monitor are the Bow and Arrows - The Bow, which though bent by superior power for som e wise purpose known only to the bender, yet springs back to its form er shape, is an em blem of our m ortal life. It typifies that the trials sent us by the Alm ighty hand should not leave us cast down, dejected and repining; but like the bow, which, when the strain is relaxed, at once resum es its original form , so we, aided by the help that com es from above, should learn to rise superior to our griefs, intent only on doing our duty, in our day and generati on, with joy and friendliness. And, as the arrow shot by the unerring hand of a skilful archer speeds straight to its destined m ark, so the Brethren and Officers of this Conclave, each in his particular sphere , will strive, we trust, with single mind and clear intention to carry out the commands of their Supreme Ruler, to render to each other comfort and aid, and to fulfil the great ends for which God has placed us here on the earth. Thus the weapons of a Secret Monitor teach us to rem ember the duties we owe to our Conclave and to each other: they also remind us of the great archer Death, whose unerring and rem orseless shaft will, sooner or later, strike each one and sum mon him to render an account of the m anner in which he has discharged his dut y to his Brother and his God. 71"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Address (SR or other Brother) Brother ___________, in adm itting you a m ember of our Order, - a step we have been induced to take by reason of the good report we have heard from those in whose judgm ent we place the utm ost confidence, - we trust we have recei ved into our ranks one whose future conduct will fully justify the choice we have m ade, whose presence am ong us will always be welcom e, whose advice within the Conclave will be fraught with wisdom and sound judgm ent, whose ear will be continually open to the cry of the suffering and n eedy, and whose bosom will ever glow with satisfaction in fulfilling the great e nds and aim s of our Order.

There his father and his brothers joined him in order to escape the crue l vengeance of the irate king, while to them flocked everyone in distress and everyone that was discontented, and he became Captain over them. Unwilli ng to place implicit confidence in these diverse supporters, David placed se ntries on the outskirts of his cam p and bound each newcom er under a solem n oath to be faithful to his chief and to his com rades; and, recalling the ol d oath, passwords and signs instituted by Moses, which had lain forgotten fo r long years except as they had been handed down by tradition through the wea lthier and m ore powerful fam ilies, he recognized the value of safeguards su ch as these and revived them . Hence are derived the word and token of this degree. The passw ord chosen by David w as, as you have already been informed, \"Ziph\" , the name of the place where David and Jonathan met for the last tim e, a place dear to David's m emory throughout the long years of the rem ainder of his life, and never for gotten by those who that day witnessed the final and afflicting severance of a friendshi p which for tenderness, fervour and constancy is unsurpassed by anything recorded in the pages of history or rom ance. In addition to this passw ord it is customary for Princes to mak e use of a secret form of greeting. This consis ts of the w ords \"Semper Fidelis\", meaning \"Ever Faithful\". (D leaves his seat, and stands in front of Candidate.) The sign is given by each extending his le ft arm to touch the center of the other' s chest with the tips of the fi ngers, raising the right arm below the other' s left arm sim ilarly to touch the cen tre of the other' s chest, thus form ing a living Magen David and it is in this position that the grip or token is exchanged by dropping your left hand and taking hold of three fingers of the other' s right hand with three fingers of your right hand (Hands at waist level.); the words ar e exchanged with the hands raised, and are \"Salaam Eleik um\" meaning \"Peace be w ith you \", to which the reply is \"Eleik um Salaam\" meaning \"With you be peace\".

He replies \"Gur?\" m ean ing \"A stranger?\", exhibits the token and adds \"Ben Abram Oveni\" meaning \"I am a son of Abraham our father\".

Lecture The circumstances in which the cha llenge, afterwards revived by David, cam e to be instituted were these. Af ter crossing the Red Sea our great and illustrious leader Moses received a vi sit from Hobab, son of Ruel the Midianite, his father-in-law, who, havi ng dwelt all his life on the borders of the wilderness, was acquainted with ever y part of it, and consequently well able to advise them on how to conduc t them selves in case they should be attacked by any of the neighboring nations. Moses persuaded Hobab to journey with the people; and Hobab j ourneyed with them until they reached the wilderness of Paran. But, after the twelve spies had returned, and the people, fearing to go in and take po ssession of the land flowing with m ilk and honey, were condem ned to wander, harasse d and em barrassed on all sides, for forty years until the carcases of all that gene ration, save only Joshua and Caleb, should have fallen in the wilderness, the m en of the 86"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"surrounding nations, m oved by the hope of gain and by jealousy of their power, sought adm ittance am ong the Israe lites, offered them their daughters in m arriage, tem pted them to serv e false gods, and wrought them m uch harm . Finding difficulty in distingui shing the stranger from the Hebrew, Moses took counsel with Joshua, Caleb, and the elders of the people, and instituted a sign, token and word wher ewith they m ight hold all strangers aloof, and so prevent them spying upon the weakness of the Hebrews or mixing with them to their detrim ent. Moses set guards or sentries upon the outskirts of the cam p, and gave them the challenge with which you have already been m ade fam iliar. (Hitherto the story has been about Mo ses; as it now changes to David the nam e David should be stressed.) You will rem ember that in addition to this challenge David protected him self from the possible infidelity of his num erous and untried followers by m eans of an oath and certain other secret s. These proved so powerful that no member of David' s devoted band was ev er found unfaithful to his trust, a traitor to the cause, or wanting in the hour of his lord' s trial and need. On the contrary, their loyalty and devotion provoked them to deeds of the utm ost heroism and daring; as, for example, when Adino, Eleazar and Shammah broke through the host of the Philistines, a nd at the risk of their lives drew water for their thirsty chief from th e well of Bethlehem, his native city. Upon his acession to the throne David re membered the oath which he sware, and when Mephibosheth, the son of J onathan, cam e to him trem bling and expecting to be put to death, as of ten happened with the seed royal upon the advent of a new dynasty, David said unto him - \"Fear not; for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy fath er's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou sha lt eat bread at m y table continually\". Again, when the Gibeonites dem anded som e of the fam ily of Saul, in order to sacrifice them as victims to stay the years of fam ine, David spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, becau se of the oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul, when they did sware, both of them , in the nam e of the Lord, saying - \"The Lord be between m e and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever\".

St. Lawrenece replied that certainly th e Christian Church was wealthy, but that he would require three days to make an inventory and set things in order. This tim e having been granted to him, St. Lawrence assembled all the halt, the m aim ed, and the blind of both se xes, and led them in processions to the great Square of the City. The Pre fect, in surprise, demanded where the treasures were, to which St. Lawrence replied, pointing to the poor and the sick, \"Behold, here are the treasures of the Christian Church.\" Infuriated by this reply, the Prefect ordered a great Gridiron to be prepared, and live coals, alm ost extinguished, to be thrown underneath, so that the Martyr m ight be more slowly burned. St. Lawrence wa s accordingly stripped, extended, and bound with chains on the iron bed over a slow fire, which broiled his flesh little by little, reaching at length even to his vitals. The Martyr, however, felt not the bodily pangs, but esteem ed his torture as refreshm ent and com fort. After having suffered a long tim e, he tu rned to the Judge, and with a sm iling and cheerful countenance, exclaim ed -\" Let m y body be turned. One side is broiled enough.\" When, by order of the Prefect, the executioner turned him over, he said - \"It is broiled enough, you m ay eat and see which is better, roast m eat or raw.\" The Token of the Degree, from which you partook of food, rem inds us of the instrum ents by which the Martyr' s body was turned.

It should ever rem ind you of the peculiar obligation you have entered into as a Knight of Constantinople.  Lecture The Emperor Constantine the Great, to enable him to cu rb the pride and arrogance of the nobility, founded this Order. Their power had so greatly increased under the weak rule of severa l of his predecessors that he foresaw that his kingdom would be greatly enda ngered unless they c ould be kept in subm ission. In order, therefore, to re medy this very great evil, and bring the nobility to a proper level with the hum ble classes, Constantine instituted this Order, and conferred it upon som e of the artizans and laborers. He then solem nly declared that he would not confer it again upon any m an, but whosoever desired to obtain it must receive it from those whom he had created Knights and appointed to be its rulers. He also announced that he would only show his favor to the Knights of Constantinople, and com manded them to put to instant death any m ember of the Order who would not acknowledge all m en to be equal. The Nobles, perceiving that they had lost the confidence of their S overeign, sent a de putation to enquire the reason, and were inform ed that favor would only be shown to the Knights of Constantinople. Accordingl y the honor was greatly sought after, and m any of the nobility having com plie d with the requirem ents of the Order, received it from the duly constitu ted authorities. Thus Constantine succeeded not only in hum bling his haughty subjects but also in warding off the peril which threatened to engulf hi s throne. This Order inculcates the virtue of hum ility. It teaches us to rem ember that those who occupy a lower station in life m ay have m ore intrin sic m erit than ourselves, to hate arrogance and pride and a bove all never to forget that \"he that exalteth him self shall be abased, but he that hum bleth him self shall be exalted.\" Closing IP - (*) Sir Knights, assist m e to close the Council.

In order for you to better unde rstand and appreciate this degree, I will now explain som e of the history of the anci ent Tyrians. Tyre was an ancient city of Phoenicia, which in the tim e of King Solomon, was celebrated as the residence of Hiram King of Tyre, to whom Solom on and his father David were indebted for great assistance in the construction of the Tem ple at Jerusalem ; for Hiram was ever a l over of David. Ty re was about one hundred m iles from Jerusalem by sea and about ninety m iles by land. An intercourse between these two cities and their respective m onarchs was, therefore, easily cultivated . The inhabitants of Tyre were distinguished for their skill as artificers, especially as workers in brass and other m etals: it was the principal seat of that skillful body of architects known as the Dionysiac Fraternity. The city of Sidon, whic h was under Tyrian governm ent was twenty m iles from Tyre, and was situat ed in the forests of Lebanon. The Sidonians were, therefore, naturally w oodcutters and were engaged in the felling of trees, which afterwards were sent in floats by sea to Joppa, and thence by land to Jerusalem , to be used in the building of the Tem ple. The glass of Sidon, the purple of Tyre, and the exceedingly fine linen they wove, were the products of their own country and the workm anship of their own hands. The Tyrians were fam ous for their skill in the working of m etals, hewing of tim bers and stone, and were also fam ous for their knowledge of that which was solid, great and ornam ental in architecture. One only needs to think of the great work which they did at the building of King Solom on' s 131"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Temple to get a clear idea of what th eir own buildings at Tyre m ust have been. Their fame was so extensive for taste, design and invention that whatever was elegant was distinguished with the title Sidonian, or as the workm anship of Tyrian artists. The c ity of Tyre and the tem ple of Dagon built by the Phoenicians at Gaza were masterpieces of art and rendered the nam e Tyrian architects deservedly celebrated throughout the world. The ancient Hebrews were not expert opera tive m asons, probably due to the fact that they had for generations led a nom adic life and dwelt in tents. They made very little contribution to scie nce. They produced no new order in architecture. Their religion forbade th eir m aking \"graven im ages\" so they did nothing in sculpturing. These two m ajor facts are responsible for the part the Masters of Tyre had in the construction of the Tem ple on Mount Moriah. With these thoughts fresh in your m ind, you are now ready for initiation. You will now be caused to represent a Courier from King Solom on to King Hiram just before the Tem ple wa s begun at Jerusalem . When you are admitted into a place representing the Royal Court of Hiram King of Tyre, you will present this scroll to the King and say, \"Illustrious Hiram King of Tyre, I have a m essage from m y lord and sovereign, Solom on King of Israel.\" You will now follow m e.

Lecture This interm ission represents the tim e required for the craftsm en to convey the body of Hiram Abif to the Tem ple, whence it was buried with all Masonic honors due that great charact er.I quote from the ancient writings: The consternation excited by this m elancholy event was much increased by a circumstance which prevented the cer emonies, usual in such cases, from being perform ed before interm ent. His eyes were not closed by his nearest relatives; his body was not washed or baptized with the custom ary form alities, nor was his corpse em balm ed. To com pensate for these om issions, after being fittingly raised, the honors of his funeral were splendid beyond all form er precedent. This great architect was not rem oved unto his own nation, and am ong his kindred , to be interred with the rite of idolatry; for being, by his m other' s side , of Israelitish extraction, he appeared to have worshipped the true God, accord ing to the usage and direction of the Mosaic law, and the Jews were extr emely superstitious respecting the place of their interm ent. They believed that , if an Israelite was buried out of 137"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Canaan, he would not so m uch as be entitled to a resurrection from the dead, much less to eternal felicity, unless G od vouchsafed to form subterranean cavities in the bowels of the earth, through which the body m ight pass from its place of interm ent into the prom ised land. This ground is taken, hereof, from the charge of Jacob unto his son Jo seph, that he should not bury him in the land of Egypt, but in Canaan. t the dedication of King Solom on' s Tem ple there were thousands present to w itness the placing of the Ark of the Covenant within the Sanc tum Sanctorum ; and an offering of twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep was m ade as a sacrifice to the Lord God of Israel . After the dedication ceremonies, the craftsm en of Tyre returned to their na tive city with feelings of pride and satisfaction in work well done.

The Due Guard is given by placing both hands just in front of the body in a position as if holding a chisel in the left hand and a m aul in the right, the right fist being about six inches above the left. The Sign is given by dropping both hands lim ply, and is sym bolical of the untim ely death of the Master Craftsm an, when he suddenly dropped forever 139"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"the working tools of life.

(SE conducts candidate to East) Lecture There are in this degree, three secti ons. In the first, you were caused to represent a Courier from Solom on King of Israel to Hiram King of Tyre just before the Tem ple was begun at Jerusa lem . In the second, you represented one of the craftsm en of Tyre in a quarry near Jerusalem. You there witnessed the discontent m anifested am ong the Tyrian craftsm en which finally culm inated in the death of Hiram Abif.

The Sacred Writings are opened at th e fifteenth Psalm to rem ind you that this was the original obligation of a Master Mason. Upon the Sacred Writings are placed the fold ed compasses in the apex of the square, which represent the letter \"T\", the initial of Ty re. It also suggests an arrow pointing from the Sacred Writings to the Expert Master, rem inding him to be ever 140"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"watchful in following and exemplifying the teachings therein contained. The working tools of a Master of Tyre are all the implements of the craft, but more especially the chisel and maul wh ich we are, sym bolically, to use in shaping our rude and im perfect natures into living stones for that building not m ade with hands eternal in the h eavens. A Quarry of Masters of Tyre represents the Royal Court of Hira m King of Tyre and com memorates the im portant part the Masters of Tyre had inb the erection of King Solom on' s Tem ple. This degree represents the meritorious order conferred upon those deserving craftsm en who served at th e building of King Solom on' s Tem ple and is dedicated to the m emory of th at celebrated architect Hiram Abif, who lost his life just before the Temple wa s completed. His death left a vacancy in Tyrian Masonry which was never filled. His cunning knowledge in the mechanical arts was derived largely from his father who was an expert craftsm an of Tyre. Hiram Abif, by his assidious study and constant intercourse with the distinguished ar tisans of Tyre, added greatly to the knowledge acquired from his father so that in tim e he becam e the m ost celebrated architect of his day. His mo ther was a Jewess, of the tribe of Naphtali, and it was at her knee that the Master Craftsman learned of the Lord God of Israel. His wife was a sister of the noble Prince Adoniram and she was also a Jewess. She was de voutly attached to her husband and Masonic tradition inform s us that, on hear ing of his untim ely death, she went up into a high m ountain and cast herself to instant death, rather than go through life without her bel oved husband. In m emory of this devoted couple, the Masters of Tyre erected three bronze statues; one at Tyre, one at Joppa and one at Jerusalem . The priests of Dionysus, having devoted them selves to architectural pursuits established, about one thousand years before the Christian era, a society of builders in Asia Minor which is styled by the ancient writers the \"Fraternity of Dionys ian Architects\". To this society was confined exclusively the privileges of erecting tem ples and other public buildings. The m embers of the Frate rnity of Dionysian Architects were linked together by the secret ties of th e Dionysian m ysteries into which they were initiated. Thus constituted, th e Fraternity was distinguished by m any peculiarities that strikingly assim ilate it to our order. In the exercise of charity, the m ore opulant were sacredly bound to provide for the exigencies of the poorer brethren. For the facility of labor and governm ent they were divided into com munities, each of wh ich was governed by as Master and Wardens. They held a general assemb ly or grand festival once each year, which was solem nized with great pom p and splendor. They em ployed in their cerem onial observances m any im plem ents which are still to be found am ong Freem asons; and used, like them , a universal language by which one 141"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"brother could distinguish another in th e dark as well as in the light and which served to unite the m embers, s cattered over India, Persia and Syria, into one com mon brotherhood. The existe nce of this order in Tyre at the building of the Tem ple is universally adm itted; and Hiram the Widow' s Son, to whom Solom on entrusted the superintendency of the workm en, as an inhabitant of Tyre, a skilled archit ect and a cunning and curious workm an was very probably one of its m embers. Hence we legitim ately suppose that the Dionysiacs were sent by Hiram King of Tyre to assist King Solom on in the construction of the house he was about to dedicate to Jehovah, that they com municated to their Jewish fellow la borers a knowledge of the advantages of their fraternity and invited them to participate in the m ysteries and privileges. In this union, however, th e apocryphal legend of the Dionysiacs would naturally give way to the tr ue legend of the Masons which was unhappily furnished by a m elancholy inci dent which occurred at the tim e; that is, the death of Grand Master Hiram Abif. This m ay explain to the initiates the cause for Solom on' s sending to Tyre for his architects and for that distinguished character, the Widow 's Son, and will also possibly show why Ancient Craft Masonry is a comb ination of Tyrian operative m asonry and Jewish religious worship. This concludes the lecture and the degree. (Candidate seated.) Closing EM - Craftsmen, the time has arrive d to cease work in this quarry. Has anyone anything to offer for the good of the craft ?

Introduction This degree is one of four added to the Allied Masonic Degrees by M.V. John Raym ond Shute II in 1933. It has a Rite of Perfection \"flavor\" and a version of it can be found in the \"Manual of Freem asonry\" by Richard 143"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Carlile printed in England in the 1800s. Becau se this ritual is a com posite of several rituals in use at the tim e (one by Finch), there are several errors within the body of the text, which cannot at this tim e be corrected with certainty. A careful observation of the te xt of the catechism s will reveal that they do not m atch the actual proceedings of the cerem ony of initiation. It can be speculated that the catechisms of one ritual were engrafted onto the initiation cerem ony of another ritual, thus m aking for the discrepancies noticed. Another hint of the period can be deduced from the reference to the Mark Degree by its two com ponent parts; Mark Man and Mark Master. This degree, together with the degrees of Grand Architect and Superintendent com prised a com plete system , m ost pr obably attached to som e other body, much the way that the Council R&SM de grees were attached originally to the Scottish Rite.

By the original design of the edifice, Solomon perceived that the firs t elevation was perfect. He, therefore, ordered a second to be placed with th e sam e proportions, under the direction of the Lodge of Architects. Under th e desire of one of these, Solom on directed that in succeeding ages, anothe r should be erected to prevent this valuable part of Masonry from being obliterated.

Use it wisely and well, rem embering that all authority to govern com es from the consent of the governed. (If desired and properly tiled, the following lecture m ay be given): Now God com manded Noah to m ake an Ark of gopher wood, instructing him how to fashion it, deno ting the length, breadth, and height thereof, with first, second and third story’s, door and window. Noah took 100 years to com plete it; he was 500 years old when he com menced it, and consequently was 600 when it was finished. He entere d into it with his wife, three sons, their wives, and two and two of all fles h wherein was the breadth of life. His father Lam ech, having died a short tim e before at the age of 777, there were no ancient patriarchs at the tim e of the flood, with the exception of Methuselah, who attained the age of 969; and as no m ention is m ade in the Holy Writ of his death, he is supposed to have perished in the great Deluge, which destroyed m ost of the m onum ents of antiquity.

The brass pillar, having been placed secure ly in a cavern, was not discovered till a very long period afterwards, as we learn from tradition, when the hieroglyphics upon it, signifying that it was the depository of the liberal Arts, and of the history of the world to this period, were written for the first 202"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"tim e and handed down.
