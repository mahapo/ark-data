(Being satisfied, continues) Somewhat of your motives, in applying for ad - mission into our ancient and honor - able Fraternity, we have learned from the declaration, over your stg - nature, contained in your petition; but, in order that you may not be misled as to the character or the purpose of the ceremonies in which you are ahout to engage, the Lodge addresses to you these preliminary words of advice; Freemasonry is far removed from all that is trival, selfish, and ungodly. Its structure is hutlt upon the everlasting foundation of that God given law, the brother - hood of man in the family whose Father is God. Our ancient and hon - orable Fraternity welcomes to its door and admits to its privileges worthy men of all creeds and of every race, yet it insists that all men shall stand upon an exact equality and receive its instructions in a spirit of due humility, emphasizing, in demeanor, in conduct, in ceremony, ‘Js FIRST DEGREE 25 and in language, the helpless, groping nature )f man at his birth, and his need of reliance upon Divine guid - ance throughout life. You will here be taught to divest your mind and conscience of all the vices and superfluities of life, and the Lodge into which you are now to be admttted expects you to divest your - self of all those distinctions and equipments which are not in keep - ing with the humble, reverent, and childltke attitude it is now your duty to assume, as all have done who have gone this way before you. Sec. to candidate: Do you declare, upon your honor, that, unbiased by the tmproper solicitation of friends, and uninfluenced by mercenary mo - tives, you freely and voluntarily offer yourself a candidate for the myster - tes of Freemasonry? Cand. I do. Sec. Do you declare, upon your honor, that you are prompted to solicit the privi— leges of Freemasonry by a favorable opinion conceived of the Institution, a desire for knowledge and a sincere wish of being serviceable to your fellow creatures?

Bro. , on being brought to light in Masonry, you behold the three great lights by aid of the repre - sentatives of the three lesser The three great lights in Masonry are the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses and are thus explained: The H. B is given us as the rule and guide for our faith and practice; the Square, to square our actions; and the Com - passes to circumscribe our desires, and keep our passions in due bounds with all mankind. The three lesser lights are the Sun, Moon, and Master of the Lodge, and are thus explained: as the Sun rules the day and the Moon governs the night, so should the W. M., with equal regularity, rule and govern the Lodge- The representatives of the three lesser lights are three burning candles, or tapers, placed upon candlesticks or pedestals, situated E. W. and S. (Lights are turned on) I particularly direct your attention to the Great Light in Masonry, the Holy Bible. Howsoever men differ in creed or theology, all good men are agreed that within the covers of the H. B. are found those principles of morality which lay the foundation upon which to build a righteous life. Freemasonry, therefore, open this Book upon its Altars, with the command to each of its votaries that he diligently study therein to learn the way to everlast - ing life. Adopting no particular creed, forbidding sectarian discussion with - in its Lodge rooms, encouraging each to be steadfast in the faith of his ac - ceptance, Freemasonry takes all good men by the hand and leading them to its Altars, points to the open Bible theron, and urges upon each- that he faithfully direct his steps through life by the Light he there shall findashe there shall find it. If, from our Sacred Altars, the atheist, the infidel, the irreligious man, or the libertine, should be able to wrest this book of Sacred Law, and thus remove, or even obscure, the greatest Light in Masonry, that Light which for centuries has been the rule and guide of Freemasons, then could we no longer claim for our - selves the great rank and title of F. & A. Masons; but, as long as that Sacred Light shines upon our Altars, so long as it illuminates the pathway of the Craftsman by its golden rays of truth, so long, and no longer, can Freemasonry live and shed its bene- - ficent influence upon mankind.

Why were you divested of all met - allic substances when made a Mason? S. D. For twa reasons; first, that I might carry nothing offensive or defensive into the Lodge, second, at the build ing of K S. T., there was not hearc’ the sound of ax, hammer or other metal tool. XV. M. How could so stupendous an ediflee hai;e been erected without the sound of metal tools. S. D.. The stones were hewn, squared and numbered in the quaries where raised, the timber felled and prepared in the forests of Lebanon; they were con - veyed by sea, in floats, to Joppa thence by land to Jerusalem, where they were set up, by the aid of wooden instruments prepared for that purpose; and when the building was completed, every part thereof fitted with such exact nicety, that it resembled more the handiwork of the Supreme Architect of the Universe than that of human hands. W. M. Why were you neither naked nor FIRST DEGREE 61 clothed? S D. Masonry regards no man on account of his worldly wealth or honors; it is the internal, and not the etaernal, qualifications that recommend a man to Masons. W. M. Why were you neither barefoot nor shod. S. D. Agreeably to an ancient Israelish custom adopted among Masons. We read in the book of Ruth concern• ing their manner of changing and re - deeming, that “To confirm all things, a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor.” That was testi - mony in [srael. This, therefore, we do. testifying thereby in the strong - est manner possible the sincerity of our intentions in the work in which we are engaged. W M. Why were you hoodwinked and a cable-tow about your neck~ S- D. For three reasons; first, that my heart might conceive before my eyes beheld the beauties of masonry; se - cond, as I was in darkness, it was to teach me to keep the whole world so, respecting the secrets of Freemason - ry, except such as were justly entitled to receive the same as I was about becoming, third, had I not con - formed to the ceremonies of my in - itiation, thereby rendering myself un - worthy to be taken by the hand as a mason, I might, by aid of the cable - tow, have been led out of the Lodge, without having beheld even the form thereof.

S. D. FIRST DEGREE Why were you caused to give three distinct knocks? To alarm the Lodge, and inform the W. Mi, that a poor blind candidate craved admittance. W. M.

How did you find that passage veri - fied by youx situation in masonry at that time? S. D.

Before entering upon any great or important undertaking, ~e ought al - ways to invoke the aid of D~ety. W. M. Why were you asked in whom you put your trust? S. D. Agreeable to our ancient law, no Aethist can be made a mason: it was therefore necessary that I abould FIRST DEGREE 83 express a belief in Diety. otherwise no obligation would have been regarded as binding. W. M. Why were you taken by the right hand, ordered to rise, follow your conductor and fear no danger? S. D. As I was in darkness, and could neither foresee nor avoid danger, it was to teach me that I was in the hands of a faithful friend in whose fidelity I might with safety confide. W. M. Why were you conducted once re - gu~ar~y around the Lodge. S. D. That the W. M., Wardens and bre - threri might see that I wag duly and truly prepared. W. M. Why wele you caused to meet with several obstructions in youx passage around the Lodge? S. D This and every regular and well governed Lodge, is, or ought to be, a certain representation of the ground floor of King Solomns Temple, who had guards stationed at the S., W. & E. gates to prevent anyone from passing or repassing except such as were duly qualified and had per - mission from K. S.; it was therefore necessary that I should meet with these several obstructions, and at each of these stations be duly ex - amined. W. M.

W. M. Why did your right hand rest upon the H. B., S. & C’s, and not your left or both? S. D.

The right, there - fore, We use in this great and import - ant undertaking testifying thereby in the strongest manner possible the fidelity of our purposes in the work in which we are engaged. W. M. Why were you presented with a lambskin or white leather apron? S. D The lamb, in all ages, has been deemed an emblem of innocence. The lambskin was, therefore, to iemind me of that purity of life and conduct so essentially necessary to my gain - ing admission to the Celestial Lodge above, where the SupremeArchitect of the Universe presides. ~V. M. Why was a demand made of you for some metallic substance? S D. To teach me that should I ever meet a member of the human family, especially a brother mason, in a like destitute situtation, it would be my duty to contribute to his relief as liberally as his necessities might re - quire and my ability permit. XV. M. Why were you placed in the N. E. corner of the Lodge? I F P[RST bEQRE~ S I).

It is sign-’d by the Grand Lodge officers, with the seal of the Grand Lodge attached and contains all the necessary instructions for retaining the same. LODGES HELD Our ancient brethren held their Lodges on high hills or in low vales, the better to ob - serve the approach of cowans and eavesdrop - pers, ascending or descending. Lodge meet - ings, at the present day, are usually held in upper chambers, probably for the better security which such places afford. The custom may have had its origin in a practice observed by the ancient Jews when building their temples, schools and syna - gogues, on high hills, a practice which seeni~ to have met the approbation of the Almighty, who said unto the Prophet Ezekiel, ~‘Upon the top of the mountain, the whole /imit thereof. round about shall be most holy.’~ FORM I The form of a Lodge is oblong, in length from east to west, in breadth between north and south, as high as Heaven and as deep as from the surface to the center. It is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Freemasonry, and teaches chat a Mason’s charity should be equally ex - tensive. SUPPORTS A Lodge is supportt.d by three great pillars, denominated Wisdom Strength, and Beauty, for there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn, all FIRST DEGREE 67 great and important undertakings. They are represented by the three principal officers of the Lodge; the pillar Wisdom, by the W.~. M.~. in the East, who is presumed to have wisdom to open and govern the Lodge; the pillar Strength, by the Senior Warden in the XVest, whose duty it is to assist the W. M. in the discharge of his arduous duties; the pillar Beauty, by the J. W. in the South, whose duty it is to call the Craft from labor to refreshment, superintend them during the hours thereof, carefully to observe that the means of refreshment are not perverted to in - temperance or excess, see that they return to their labor in due season, that the W. M. may receive honor, and they pleasure and pro- it thereby. COVERING The covering of a Lodge is no less than the clouded canopy, or starry-decked Heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by aid of that ladder which Jacob in his via. son saw extended from earth to Heaven, the principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity, which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and Charity to all mankind.

M., be - , cause it is the proper Masonic e m b I e m of his office; and the Compasses to the Craft, for, by a due attention to their use, we are taught to circumscribe our desires and keep our passions in due bounds. ORNAMENTS The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Moeaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Bla: - ing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the Indented Tessel, of that beautiful tessel - ated border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of hu - man life, checkered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel, or tesselated border, of the manifold blessings and comforts which cons - tantly surround us, and which we hope to en - joy by a firm reliance on Divine Providence, which is represented by the Blazing Star in the center. LIGHTS A Lodge has three symbolic Lights, situated East, West, and South. There is none in the North, because King Solomon’s Temple was situated so far north of the ecliptic that the sun, even at meridian, did not dart its rays into the northernmost part thereof. The North we Masonically term a place of dark - ness, FIRST DEGREE 69 JEWELS A Lodge has six jewels, three movable and three immovable The Immovable Jewels are the Square, the Level and the Plumb. They are so termed because they are appropriated to particular parts of the Lodge where they s h o u I d be found, the Square to the East, the Level to the West, and the Plumb to the South. Al - though the brethren occupying these stations, may from time to time be changed, still the Jewels will always be found in their respective stations in the Lodge. The Square teaches morality, the Level, equality; and the Plumb rectitude of conduct The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle-Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone in its rude and natural state, as taken from the quarry; the Perfect Ashlar, one prepared by the work - men, to be adjusted by the working tools of Fellowcraft, and the Trestle Board is for the Master Workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of that rude and imperfect state which is ours by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of Deity. And as the operative work - man erects his temporal building in accord - ance with the designs laid down upon the Trestle-Board by the Master Workman, so should we, both operative and speculative worktnen, endeavor to erect our spiritual building in accordance wth the designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Uni - verse in the great Book of Revelation, which is our Masonic Trestle-Board.

King Solomon’s Temple is said to have been a re - presentation of that Tabernacle. TO WHOM DEDICATED Anciently, Lodges were dedicated to King Solomon, as he is said to have been our first Most Worshipful Grand Master: but specula - tive Masons dedicate theirs to the memory of St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evan - gelist. Since their time, there is represented, in every regular and well-governed lodge, a cer - tain point within a circle, the point represent - ing the individual brother, the circle, the boundary line of his conduct to God and man, beyond which he is never to suffer his pas - sions, prejudices, or interests to betray him This circle is bordered by two perpendicular parallel lines representfng these Saints, and upon the vertex rest the Holy Scriptures, which point out the whole duty of man. In going around this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially err. PRINCIPAL TENETS The principal Tenets of our profession are three-fold, including the inculation and prac - tice of those truly commend able virtures, BROTHERLY LOVE, RELIEF & TRUTH BROTHERLY LOVE By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the human race as one family, the high, the low, the rich, the poor, who, created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabiting the same planet, should aid, sup - port and protect one another. On this prin - ciple, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and promotes true friend - ship among those who might otherwise have remained perpetually at a distance. RELIEF To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, particularly upon Ma - sons, who are linked together by a chain of sincere affection To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with them in their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, are aims we have in view- On this basis we establish our connections and form our friendships. TRUTH Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Ma - sonry. Hence, while influenced by this prin - ciple, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us; sincerity and plain dealing dis - tin guish us; and the heart and tongue N B this card is void if piesented after dote limit This Tiaveling Shield is not Transferable and must be shown when inquired It is evidence that the undersigned is a member in goad and requlor standing until the date indicated on reverse side of this card.

My Bro. ther, in order that you may better under - stand what is to follow, I will ask the S. D a question. Bio. S. D. (Under due guard) W. M. How may I know you to be a Mason? By certain signs, a token, a word, and the perfect points of my entrance. My Brother, the signs, token and word have been explained to you but the perfect points of your entrance have not. They are four;— the Pectoral, the Manual, the Guttural, and the Pedal. They represent the four cardinal virtues — Fortitude. Prudence, Temperance and Justice. Fortitude is that noble and steadfast pur - pose of the mind, whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril, or danger. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice, and should be deeply impressed upon your mind as a safeguard or security against any attempt that might be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from you any of the secrets with which you have been sol - emnly intrusted This virtue was emblematic. ally represented upon your first anmission in to the Lodge, when you were received on the point of a sharp instrument piercing your naked left breast. This is the first perfect point of your entrance, the Pectoral. Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of rea - son, and is that habit by which we wisely judge and determine on all things relative to our present, as well as our future happiness. This virtue should be your characteristic, not only In the government of your conduct while in the Lodge. but also when abroad in the world. You should be particularly c&utioua, in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token or word, whereby the secrets of Freemasonry might be obtain - ed. ever bearing in remembrance that solemn moment, while kneeling at the sacred Altar of Freemasonry, with your left hand support - ing, and right resting upon the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, you solemnly prom - ised to conceal and never reveal any of the secrets of Freemasonry. This is the second perfect point of your entrance: the Manual. Temperance is that due restraint upon the passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the at’ lurements of vice. This virtue shuold be your constant practice, as you are thereby taught to avoid excess, and the contracting of any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence of which might lead you away from the path of righteousness and cause ~ou also to disclose those secrets which you have promised to conceal and never reveal, the betrayal of which would subject you to the contempt of all good Masons, if not to the penalty for the violation of your obligation; that of hay. ing your thrt cut acra, your tngu tin out, nd brd in th snd of tIm sea at 1w wtr mrk, whre th tde ebbsnd fiws twc in twnty four hra.

This is the fourth perfect point of your en - trance: the Pedal, and alludes to the position of your feet while standing in the N. E. cor - ner of the Lodge CHALK, CHARCOAL AND CLAY Entered Apprentices should serve their Masters with freedom, fervency, and zeal, which are emblematically represented by chalk, charcoal and clay. There is nothing freer than chalk, the slightest touch of which leaves a trace: there is nothing more fervent than charcoal, for to it, when properly ignited, the most obdurate metals will yield. There is nothing more zeal - ous than clay, our mother earth, for it, alone of all the elements, has never proved unfriend - ly to man. Through constantly harassed, more to furnish the luxuries than the necessaries of life, she never refuses her yield, strewing our pathway with flowers and spreading our table with plenty; though she produces poi - son, still she furnishes the antidote, and re - turns with interest every good committed to her care And when at last we are called up - on to pass through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, she once more receives us, and ten- derly enfolds our remains within her bosom, thus admonishing us that, as from earth we came, so to earth we must surely return. SYMBOLISM The first, or Entered Aporentice Degree, of Masonry is symbolically intended to re - present the entrance of man into the world, in which he is afterward to become a living and thinking actor Coming from the ignor ance and darkness of the outer world, his first craving is for light, not that physical light which springs from the great orb of day at its foundation, but that moral and intellect - ual light which emanates from the primal source of all things — from the Great Archi - tect of the Universe, the Creator of the sun and of all that it illuminates. Hence, the great, the primary object of the first degree is to symbolize that birth of intellectual light into the mind, and the Entered Apprentice is the type of unregenerate man, groping in moral and mental darkness, and seeking for the light which is to guide his steps and point him to the path which leads to duty, and to Him who gives to duty its reward. Those around you are your brethren, ready to discharge all the offices of that intimate relation. They now bid you welcome to their number and fellowship, to their affections and assistance, to their privileges and joys; and through me they promise to protect you by their influence and authority, to advise you by their ability and skill, to assist your exist - ence by their liberality and bounty, and to cheer you at all times with their kindness and love.

How successful in its progress and how happy in its end you may fully know if you are but attentive, faithful and wise. Your diligence and activity in works, your skill in acquiring the instructions of your degree, and your zeal in the cause of Freemasonry will lead you forward to greater heights, to clearer views and to nobler privileges. This concludes the first degiee of Masonry, with the exception of the charge. (Please rise.) CHARGE As you are now introduced into the first principles of Freemasonry, I con - gratulate you upon being accepted into this ancient and honorable Fraternity—ancient as having subsisted from time immemorial, honorable as tending in every particular so to render all men who conform to its pre - cepts. No institution was ever raised upon a better principle, or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been encour - agers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, extend its privileges, and patronize its assembles. 1’here are three great duties, which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never mentioning His name save with that rever - ential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; imploring His aid in all your undertakings, and esteeming Him as the Chief Good; to your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you: and to yourself, in avoid - ing all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties, or debase the dig. nity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties ~vill insure public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet and peaceable citizen, true to your government and just to your country. You are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but are patiently to submit to legal authority, and conform ~vitli cheerfnliiess to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor, be particular - ly careful to avoid censure or reproach. (Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity, or influence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action.) Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected: neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument with those who through ignorance, may ridicule or defame it, N B This card is void if presented after dote limit This Tiaveling Shield is not Transferable and must be shown when inquired It is evidence that the undersigned is a member in goad and regular standing until the dote indicated an reverse side of this cord.

Finally, keep sacred and inviolate the principles of the Fraternity, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the commun - ity, and mark your consequence among Ma - sons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly careful not to recommend him unless you are convinced that he will con1~orm to our rules so that the honor, gli.,i), and reputation of the Institution may continue firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effeeta.

(Conducts the candidate inside the room and begins:) The second section of this degree has reference to the origin of the Institution, and views Masonry under two denominations, Operative and Speculative. By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and a just correspond - ence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelter from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man, for the hest, most salutary, and beneficent pur - poses. 5 By Speculative or Free Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, main - tain secrecy and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion, as to lay us un - der obligation to pay that homage to Deity, which at once constitutes duty and our hap - piness. It leads the contemplative to view, with reverence and admiration, the glorious works of creation, and inspires them with the most exalted ideas of the perfection of their Divine Creator. The second section of this degree also refers to the origin of the Jewish Sabbath, as well as to the manner in which it was kept by our ancient brethren. In six days God created the Heaven and the earth, and rested on the seventh day The seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labor, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of creation and to adore their great Creator. At the building of King Solomon’s Temple there were eighty thousand Fellow- crafts employed. These were all under the immediate direction of our ancient operative Grand Master, H. A. On the evening of the sixth day their worli was inspected, and all those who had proved themselves worthy, by strict fidelity to their duties, were invested with certain mystic signs, grips and words, to enable them to gain admission into the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple. On the same day and hour King Solomon, accompained by his confidential officers, con - sisting of his Secretary, S and J. W’s; repair - ed to the Middle Chamber to meet them. His Secretary he placed near his person, the S. W. at the inner and the J. W. at the outer door, giving them strict instiuctions to suffer none to enter except such as were in possession of certain mystic signs, grips, and words prev - iously established; so that when any did enter, he, knowing that they must have been faithful workmen or they could not have N B this card is void it presented after date limit This raveling Shield is not Transferable and i~ust be shown when inquired It is evidence that the undersigned is a member in good and regular standing until the date indicated oii reverse side of this cord.

This, you will perceive, was all accomplished on the evening of the sixth day, that no unnece~ sary labor might be performed on the seventh. We, my brother, are in possession of the same mystic signs, grips and words as were our ancient brethren, and are now about to endeavor to work our way into a place re - presenting the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple, and should we succeed, I have no doubt, we will be alike received and rewarded. “THE PILLARS” In doing this it will be necessary for us to make an advance, emblematically, through a porch, up a flight of winding stairs, consisting of three, five and seven steps, through an outer and an inner door. In mak - ing this advance we necessarly pass between two pillars, representing those famous pillars erected at the entrance to the porch of King Solomon’s Temple, one on the right hand, the other on the left. The name of the one on the left hand was B—, denoting strength; the name of the one on the right, J—, denoting establishment, collectively alluding to the sever- a I promises of God to David, one of which reads,”And thy house and thy Kingdom shall he established forever before thee.” S SECOND DEGREE Those two pillars were thirty and five enbits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them five cubirs—in all forty cubits. Their composition was of molten or cast brass, the better to withstand hun. dation or conflagration; that they might not be removed by flood nor consumed by fire. They were cast in the clay grounds on the bank of the river Jordan, between Succoth and Zeredatath, where King Solomon ordered those and all the sacred vessels of the Temple to be cast; they were cast hollois~ for the pur. pose of conlaining the rolls and records which comprised the archives bf our ancient bre - thren. The chapiters were ornamented with leaves of lily work, net-work, and chains of pomegranate. The Lily, from its extreme whiteness, as well as the retired situtations in which it grows, denotes Peace; the Net-work, from the intimate connection of all its parts, Unity; and the Pomegranate, from the ex - uberance of its seed, Plenty. Peace, that here on the broad plat - form of brotherly love, the high, the low, the rich, the poor, may meet together with one common purpose, the perpetuation of each other’s friendship and each other’s love. Unity, being linked together by a chain of sincere friendship. Plenty, that though it may be given to some to have more of the world’s goods than others, still the man that has his health, strength and ambition has indeed his plenty.

Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with reverence for God and His works, and are encouraged to study astrono - my, geography, navigation, and the arts de - pendent upon them, by which mankind has been so much benefited. Their principal use, besides serv tog as maps to distinguish the outward parts of the earth, and the situtation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and explain the phen - omena arising from the annual revolution of the earth around the sun, and the diurnal rotation of the earth upon its own axis. They are invaluable instruments for improving the mind, giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or proposition as well as enabling it to solve the same. We will now make an advance, and ascend the three steps (Pass between the pillars and take 3 short steps.) The three steps allude t~ the precious jewels. the attentive ear, the in - structive tongue and the faithful breast, which have already been explained to you: they also allude to the three principal officers of the Lodge, the W. M. in the East, the S. W in the West, and theJ.W.in the South. We will now make a further ad - vance and ascend the five steps. L (Take five short steps toward the center of L.) The five steps allude to the five orders of architecture, and the five human senses. By order in Architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect and com - plete whole. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a cov• ering The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and, from this simple hint, originally proceed - ed the more improved art of architecture.

Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, ex - cept mouldings, though the frieze is disting - uished by triglyphs and metopes, and tri - glyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are desired. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. THE IONIC The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and the more delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentils. There are both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pilh.r, the in - Vention of which is attributed to the lonians - The famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this order. THE CORINTHIAN The Corinthian, the richest of the five or - ders, is deemed a master-piece of art.

To these the Romans have added two, the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which is more or - namental than the Corinthian.

The first three of which have ever been deemed prerequisite to being made a Mason: for by hearing we distinguish the word, 5—; by seeing we per - ceive the sign, (sign of F. C. given) and by feeling we receive that friendly or brotherly grip (gives grip) whereby one Mason may know another in the dark as in the light. H EARING Hearing is that sense by which we disting. uish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires: and thus our reason is rendered capable of exerting its utmost power and en - ergy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge from social intercourse with each other For these purposes we are en - dowed with hearing, that, by a proper exert - ion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete. SEEING Seeing is that sense by which we disting - uish objects, and in an instant of time, with - out change of place or situation,, view armies in battle array, the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of nature.

By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more, by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections of our fellow-creatures when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dis - semble, the countenance will display the hypo - crisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which administer to this sense are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, Sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye, and its appurten - ances, evince the admirable contrivances of nature for performing all its various external and internal motions; while the variety dis - played in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demon - strates this organ to be the masterpiece of nature’s works. FEELING Feeling is that sense by which we disting - uish the different qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion and extension. SMELLING Smelling is that sense by which we disting - uish odors; the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and indeed most other SECOND DEGREE 111 bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia’ of vast subtility, as well in a state of life and growth as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These eli - luvia, bei’,g drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all bodies are distinguished Hence it is evident that there is a manifeist appearance of design in the great Creator having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in respiration TASTING Tasting enables us to maie a proper dis - tinction in the choice of our food.

On the mind all our knowledge must de - pend; what theiefore, can be a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons? To sum up the whole of this trancedent measure of God’s bounty to man, we shall add that memory, imagination, taste, reason - ing, moral perception, and all the active pow - ers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field for philosophical disquisition, which far exceeds human inquiry, and are peculiar my - steries, known only to nature and to natures God, to whom all are indebted for creation, preservation, and every blessing we enjoy. We will now make a still further advance and ascend the seven steps. (Seven short steps are taken towards the J. W. station) ARTS & SCIENCES The seven steps allude to the seven liberal Arts and Sciences, which are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Music. GRAMMAR U Grammar is the science which teaches us how to express our ideas in correct language, which we afterwards beautify and adorn by means of Rhetoric; while Logic instructs us how to think and reason with propriety. RHETORIC It is by Rhetoric that elegance of diction is taught. (To be an eloquent speaker, is far from being either a common or an easy attain - ment; it is the art of being persuasive and L commanding; the art, not only of pleasing the fancy, but of appealing both to the under - standing and to the heart.) LOGIC Logic is that science which teaches us how to form clear and distinct ideas, and prevents us being misled by similitude or resemblances, (This science should be cultivated as the foundation or ground work of our inquiries; particularly in the study of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons.) ARITHMETIC Arithmetic is the science of numbers, or that bianch of mathamatics which considers the properties of numbers in general. (We have but a very imperfect idea of things with - out quantity, and as imperfect an idea of quantity itself without the aid of Arthmetic. All the works of the Almighty are expressed in number, weight, and measure; therefore, to understand them rightly, we ought to un - derstand arithmetical calculations; and the greater the advancement we make in the mathematical sciences, the more capable we shall be of considering such things as are the ordinary subjects of our conception, and be thereby lead to a better knowledge of our Great Creator, and the works of his creation.) GEOMETRY Geometry treats of the powers and propert - ies of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered. (from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, from a superficies to a solid.

A line has length without breadth. A surface is that whu:h has length and breadth without thickness. A solid is a magnitude which has length, breadth, and thickness.) dy this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs: the general, to arrange his soldiers; the en - gineer to mark out grounds for encampments, the geographer, to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of seas, and speci - fy the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is en - abled to make his observations, and to fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles.. ASTRONOMY Astronomy is that science which treats of the heavenly bodies, their motion, magnitude. distances, and physical constitutions. How eloquent of Deity is the Celestial Hemisphere, spangled with the most magnificent heralds of His infinite glory. MUSIC (Organ starts playing very soitly) Music is that art which affects the passions by sound. There are few who have not felt its charms, arid acknowledged its expressions to be intelligible to the heart. It is a language of delightful sensations far more eloquent than words; it breathes to the ear the clearest in - timations, it touches and gently agitates the sublime passions: it wraps us in melancholy, and elevates us in joy: it dissolves and in- flames, it melts us in tenderness, and excites ut. to war. (Organ plays Star Spangled Banner) The martial strains of national airs heard on the field of battle have thrilled the soldier’s heart, causing him to burn with an emulous desire to lead the perilous advance, and ani - mating him to deeds of heroic valor and sub - lime devotion; amidst the roar of cannon, t~he din of musketry, and the carnage of battle, he sinks to the dust. Raising himself to take one long last look of life, he hears in the dis - tance that plaintive strain: Home, Sweet Home. (Organ plays Home Sweet Home, first softly and then louder.) And the mellowing tides of old cathedral airs vibrating through aisles and arches have stilled the ru fIled spirit, and sweeping away the discordant passions of men, have borne them along its resistless current, until their united voices have joined in sounding aloud the chorus of the Heaven-born Anthem: “Peace on Earth, good will towards men.” But it never sounds with such seraphic har - mony, as when employed in singing hymns of gratitude to the Creator of the Universe W.M.

The Eph - ramites had long been a stubborn and rebellious people whom Jephthah had striven to subdue by mild and lenient measures, but without effect. They, being highly incensed at Jeph - thah for not being called to fight and share in the rich spoils of the Amoni - tish War, gathered together a mighty army, crossed the river Jordan, and prepared to give Jepthah battle; but he, being apprised of their approach called together the men of Israel, K went forth, gave them battle, and put them to flight. To make his victory more complete, he stationed guards at the different passes along the banl of the river, and said unto them, if you see any strangers pass this way, say unto them: •iNow say ye, 5—.” The Ephramities, being of a different tribe, could not frame to pronounce the word, and said This triffling defect proved them enemies and cost them their lives, and there fell that day on the field of battle, and at the different passes a- long the bank of the river, forty and two thousand, after which Jephthah ruled quietly in Israel until the time of his death, in all, six years.

This gave rise to societies, and birth to eveiv useful art.

In the second month of the fourth year of his reign, Solomon commenced the erection of this edifice, the curious workmanship of which was calculated to excite the wonder and admiration of all succeeding ages. It was located on Mount Moriah, near the place where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and where David met and ap - peased the destroying angel, which was visi - ble over the threshing-floor of Oman, the Jebusite. About this time, King Solomon received a congratulatory letter from Hiram K. of T. offering him every assistance in his power, and manifesting a strong desire to participate in the high honors then clustering around the Throne of Israel. Thus was the building progressing, with the assistance of Hiram, [C. of T. and under the immediate supervision of our ancient oper - ative G.M.H.A., and was well-nigh completed when several of the Craft, in an attempt to extort from G.M.H.A., the secret word of Master Mason, became his assassins. Thus for a short period was the building impeded in its progress. You, my brother, have this evening re - presented our ancient operative Grand Master Hiram Abiff, whose custom it was every day at high twelve, while the craft were at re - freshment, to enter the Temple and draw his designs upon the Trestle-board, after which he repaired to the unfinished Sanctum Snac - I I torum, to offer up his prayers to the ever- living and true God. After performing these pious devotions, on the day of his death, he attempted to pass out at the South Gate, where he was accosted by J A., who thrice demanded the secret word of Master Mason, and on his third refusal struck him with a twenty-four inch guage across the throat; he then attempted to pass out at the West Gate, where he was accosted by J-O., who also, thrice demanded the secret word of Master Mason, and on his third re - fusal struck him with the angle of a square on the right breast; he then attempted to pass out at the East Gate, where he was ac - costed by J-M., who also thrice demanded the secret word of Master Mason, and on his third refusal struck him with a setting maul on the forehead, which felled him lifeless at his feet. The Ruffians then buried the body in the rubbish, and agreed to meet at low twelve for consultation. They accordingly met and carried the body a Westerly course to the / brow of a hill, where they had a grave pre - pared, and buried it, planting a sprig of acacia at the head of the grave to mark the spot, should future occasion require them to find it, and then endeavored to make their escape from the realm.

He repaired to the Hall of Audience, where he met Hiram, King of Tyre. and when he inquired the cause, was inform - ed that there were no designs on the Trestle- board, and that G.M.H.A. was missing. He then ordered strict search to be made in and about the several apartments of the Temple to see if he could be found. Strict search was accordingly made, but without tidings; he had not been seen since high twelve the day before. About this time twelve Fellowerafta appeared before K. S., clothed in white gloves and aprons, tokens of innocence, and confessed that they, with three others, bad entered into a conspiracy to eictort from G. M.H.A. the secret word of Master Mason or take his life. Reflecting on the enormity of the crime, they had recanted and humbly craved his pardon. They feared, however, that the others had been so base as to carry their murderous designs into execution. He ordered them to repair to their labor, at the same time informing them that their pardon would depend upon their future con~ duct. He then ordered the several rolls of work - men to be called, to see who, if any, were missing. The rolls were accordingly called, and three were missing, 3-A, J•O and J-M, brothers and men of Tyre. He then request - ed Hiram, K. of T. to select from the different bands of workmen the twelve Felloweralts who had appeared before him, divide them into parties of three and send them E.. W..

He replied that he had; three the day before, who, I r o m their general appearance, he supposed to be men of Tyre, from a strong family resemblance, brothers, and from their being clothed in white gloves and aprons must have been workmen from the Temple. They were endeavoring to obtain passage to Ethiopia; but King Solomon having issued an edict forbidding any person leaving the realm without his pass, and not having it, they failed to obtain passage, and returned into the country. With this information they returned to King Solomon, who said that these, no doubt, were the ruffians, but that it was not satis - factory, and ordered them to again travel, with the positive assurance that if they did not succeed in bringing the ruffians to justice they would be deemed the murderers of G M. HA., and suffer accordingly. They traveled as directed, and on arriving at the brow of a hill, one of the companions, being weary, sat down to rest and refresh himself. On attempting to rise, he accidently caught hold of a sprig of acacia, which so easily gave way as to excite his suspicion. He thereupon hailed his companions, and while conversing on the singularity of the occur - ence, they distinctly heard voices issuing from the clefts of the adjacent rocks, the first of which they recognized as the voice of 3-A.

Thus were the remains of G.M H.A. raised from their humble resting-place, conveyed to the Temple, and thence to the place of burial, which was as near the unfinished Sanctum Sanctorum as the Jewish laws allowed, and over his grave was erected a monument of the finest marble, on which were delineated a broken column and a weeping virgin; in her right hand a sprig of acacia, in her left an urn, before her an open book, and Time behind, unfolding and counting the ringlets of her hair. The broken column denotes that one of the principal supports of Freemasonry has fallen, the virgin weeping, the untimely death of G.M.H A.; the sprig of acacia, that which lead to the timely recovery of his re - mains; the urn, that his ashes are safely de - posited; the open book, that his memory is on perpetual record among Masons; Time denotes that although G.M.

This we regard as a striking manifestation of the superintending care of Divine Providence lt is said to have been supported by four - teen hundred and fifty three columns, and two thousands nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest marble. There were employed in its erection three Grand Masters, three thousands three hun - dred Masters, or Overseers of the work, eighty thousand Fellowcrafts, or hewers in the mountains and quarries, and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices, or bearers of burdens.

SYMBOLISM Thus have I rehearsed to you the legend of the death of Hiram Abiff, a history venerated as a reminiscence of days long passed and regarded by Masons with perculiar reverence, not so much for the history itself, as for the solemn and sublime doctrine it is intended to impress on our minds - - the resurrection of the body and the immortality of the soul.

Your admission among Freemasons in a state of blindness and destitution was emble - matical of the entrance of all mankind upon this, their mortal state of existence, when, weak and helpless, they are necessarily de. pendent upon others for protection and life. As the noblest emotions of the heart are called forth by helpless infancy, so is the de - gree of E. A. intended to inculcate the strik - ing lesson of natural, equality and mutual dependency. It taught us, in the active principles of universal benevolence a n d charity, to seek the solace of our own dla— tress by extending comfort and consolation to our fellow creatures in the hour of their affliction. It enabled you to free the mind from the dominion of pride and prejudice. to look beyond the narrow limits of human institutions, and to view in every a o n of Adam a brother of the dust. Above all and beyond all, it taught you to bend with hum - ility and resignation before the Great Archi - tect of the Universe, to dedicate to Him your heart thus purified from every maligant passion, and prepare your mind f 0 r the reception of truth and wisdom. Proceeding onward, still guided by the prin. ciples of brotherly love, relief and truth, you were passed to the degree of F. C., where you were enabled to contemplate the intellectual faculties; to trace them from their origin through the paths of heaven - born science, even to the throne of God Himself. The secrets of Nature and the principles of moral truth were thus unveiled before you You ¶ learned the just estimation of those wond. rous faculties wherewith God has endowed the creatures formed after His own image, and you feel the duty He has imposed upon you of cultivating those divine attributes with unremitting care and attention, that you may thereby be enabled to glorify Him and render yourself a contribution to the happiness of mankind. To the man whose mind has thus been molded to virtue and science, Nature pre - sent~ one great and useful lesson more, the knowledge of himself. She leads you by con - templation to the closing hours of your exist~ ence; and when, by means of that contem - plation, she has conducted you through the various windings of this mortal life, she finally instructs you how to die. She leads you to reflect upon your inevitable destiny, and prompts the inward man to say that death has no sting equal to the stain of false - hood, and that the certainty of death at any time is better than the possibility of dishonor. Of this great principle Freemasonry affords a gloriotis example in the unshaken fidelity and noble death of our G.M.H.A., whom you have this evening represented, and I trust it will be a striking lesson to us all, should we ever be placed in a similar state of trial. And now, my brother, let us symbolize the death of our G M H.A., and apply his pre paration for and readiness in facing death, to ourselves.

Thus it is with man. Strong in youth and confident in his strength, he starts forth to execute the designs which he has drawn upon the great trestle-board of his life; but at the very outset he meets his first enemy, his J.A., in his own evil passions — in envy, hate licentiousness and debauchery — defacing the beautiful mirror of his soul by their bane - ful influences. But these may be overcome; and, still strong in faith and hope, he passes forward on life’s journey to meet his second and still stronger enemy, his J0., fitly re~ presented by sorrow and misfortune, by disease or poverty, by the coldness of false friends or the hostility of open enemies. Weary and faint from the conflict, still struggling for the right, upward looking with eyes of faith, though these enemies be sub dued, he meets in the evening of his days, his third and terrible enemy, his J-M. To him this enemy is Death—Death, from whom there can be no escape — Death, before whom all must yield, whether they be the yoang, the beautiful, or the gifted — like J.M., a relent - less enemy, insisting upon having his victim. To the careless and thoughtless the lesson would end here, but the upright and true Mason must pursue it further, and apply it to the eternal salvation of his soul, so beautifully typfied by the evergreen sprig of acacia, which teaches us, that although our frail bodies must, sooner or later, moulder in the bosom of our Mother Earth, yet through the merits of the divine promises contained in the Great Light in Masonry, we may con - ( __ ‘4 fiduntly hope that our souls will bloom in immortal greatness. Remember, then, that as the body of our G.M.H A was boned in the rubbish of the Temple, so shall yours be buried in earths friendly bosom, as he was raised, so likewise must you be raised — not, indeed, by the brotherly grip of an earthly master, bet at the lawful command of Him who rules heaven and the earth, and in answer to whose sum - mons and word graves will be opened, seas give up their dead, and all the profane and initiated will stand before His judgement seat in the Grand Orient of the Universe to ren - der unto Him their dread account.

Manhood and Age In Youth, as E.A~s, we should occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge in manhood, as F.

A~t we came into the world rational and in telligent beings~ so should we ever be indust - rious, never content to be idle, while our fellow creatures are in want, if it is in oui power to relieve them. When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless than the brute creation He lies languishing for days months and years, totally incapable of pro - viding sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclem - encies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creater of Heaven and earth to make man independent of all other beings, hut as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, men were made dependent on one another for protection and security, whereby they enjoy better opportunities to form the ties of love and friendship. Thus was man formec~. for social and active life, the noblest work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to endeavor to add to the common stock of knowledge and under - standing, may be deemed a useless member of society, unworthy of our protection as Masons.

In the character of a Master Mason, you are authorized to correct the errors and ir - regularities of your uninformed brethren, and to guard them against a breach of fidelity. To preserve the reputation of the Fraternity unsulled must be your constant care.

Your virtue, honor, and reputation are con - cerned in supporting with dignity the char - acter you now bear. Let no motive, therefore, make you swerve from your duty, violate ) your vows, or betray your trust, but be true and faithful, and imitate the example of that celebrated artist whom you have this even - ing represented.

Our neighbor comes second because God himself has so ordered in those ten greater commandments written with His own finger of Divinity.
