This book is a response to many inquiries concerning the materials covered herein. Violations of the Constitution will occur at times, usually through ignorance. The real of - femse is the lack of knowledge, not the violation. This Manual will give the needed knowledge. Observance of the Grand Chapter Constitution and the Chapter fly-Laws is fundamental, of course. These contents are not innovations but are intended for the establishment of cus - toms and the observance of Landmarks, which are the bases of Chapter etiquette and manners, both desirable virtues.

No Mason in this state is unaware of the marked improvement that has oc - curred in the Craft since our Grand Lodge made available the little volume Masonic Etiquette. Its influence has gone out in all directions; it touches the lives of all Master Masons wherever assembled. It is our express desire that this Officers’ Man - ual shall clarify the duties and responsi - bilities of Chapter Officers and make their tasks less difficult. It should create a re - spect for the Royal Craft in the State of New York and we trust merit a cordial reception beyond the bounds of our own jurisdiction. The first edition of 2,504) copies of this Manual, long since exhausted, was. a com - pilation of the work done by several pre - vious committees. Many have contributed to this present revised and enlarged edi - tion and the Committee makes grateful acknowledgment to all. The dominant desire was to present a Manual for Chap - ter procedure and etiquette so that the —4 vi :9—., plea, “He stands accused rather through ignorance on his part” may not be said of any officer. To help, aid and assist is the objective. In Montesquieu, Spirit of Laws V. 7 we read, “The preservation of the ancient customs is a very considerable point in respect to maimers. Since a corrupt people seldom perform any memorable actions, seldom establish societies, build cities, or enact laws; on the contrary since most institutions are derived from people of simple or severe morals, to recall men to ancient maxims is generally recalling them to virtue.” (JominAttee on Masonic Edwoation and Service. ‘vii"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nJ w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichlingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtirigargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s. ni w.stichtingargu s.n I w.stichtingargu s.n I w.stichtingargu s. n I w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. iii r 9’ N.. LEADERSHIP The standing and the accomplishinente of a Chapter are in no small measure de - pendent upon the leadership-ability of the Officers selected. Fine character and good 8tanding in the community are basic to Masonic membership. Enthusiasm, in the promotion of the principles of Masonry, willingness to render service and e’recu - tive ability should be further attributes upon which officer-selection should be made. A Companion once selected to serve as an officer has a right to aspire to preside over his Chapter but he must remember the obligation and responsibility that is necessary for Masonic preferment. It is understood that no officer is considered qualified for advancement who does not make constant study of the Constitution and Code of Procedure of the Grand Chapter. A working knowledge of them and the By-Laws of his Chapter will prove of incalculable value in the administra - tion of his duties as a presiding officer. An appointive office, in our system, is viii filled by the presiding officer, only, as pro - vided in the Grand Constitution. The Companion so appointed fills his station at the will and pleasure of the presiding High Priest. Progress in the line is not automatic and it does not follow that each successive High Priest will advance each man in the line. Lack of interest, con - stant unexcused absence and other condi - tions are ample reasons for removal and the appointment of another. It is better that the one dropped, with his friends, be disappointed, than that the Chapter should suffer. (No individual is bigger than the organization!) Tact and consid - eration can obviate disgruntlement. No Chapter will prosper with poor offi- cers. Capable leadership includes the training of future leaders. The wise leader will at regular inter - vals call together his fellow-officers for the purpose of discussing the problems of the Chapter. Such matters as finance, budgeting, ritual and social activities, and the special problems of the year also should be considered.

How can he be enthusiastic about a program he has had no part in planning? Officers and Companions are sure to take deeper interest in carrying any plan to fruition, if their suggestions are made a part of the adopted program. The very prosperity of Capitular Ma - sonry is dependent upon the Officers of constituent Chapters. If Officers are capa - ble, trained, zealous, enthusiastic, the Chapters will grow and take their rightful places in Masonry and in the communi - ties. No Officer is indispensable. New material should be developed. Remember every Companion exalted is a potential Grand High Priest. More than one office boy has become Chairman of the Board. x K AN ORDER OF BUSINESS Opening of Chapter 2.

A 50-year, a 75-year, a centennial or sesquicentennial annivers - ary is an important event and should be properly celebrated. An anniversary fund should be set up at least ten years in advance to which contributions may be made annually and money added by the membership by be - quest and in various other ways. The Chapter anniversary should be planned well in advance of the time it is to be enjoyed. Connnittees on program, publication, dinner, tickets, music, favors, singers, speakers, publicity, guests — all need ample time to ‘work. A.

The Grand High Priest has many com - mitments during his tenure of office, many of which are determined months in advance. He, with the Grand Officers, should be extended an early invitation if expected to be in attendance. GET THE DATE SET FIRST. Then mal~e your plans. BALLOTING The rules governing balloting are found in the Constitution of Grand Chapter. The ballot protects the Chapter against those not deserving the title of Companion. No one may be excused from the duty of cast - ing his ballot. No Companion will permit his vote to be influenced by selfishness, prejudice or anger, nor will he divulge his vote, even when questioned about it. Balloting once begun must be com - pleted without interruption or postpone - ment. The ballot for degrees must be 4 unanimous and secret. The doors should be closely tiled, of course. When about to ballot, the High rriest orders the Captain of the Host to prepare the ballot-box. He in turn directs the Principal Sojourner to prepare and pre - sent the ballot-box. After examination of the ballot-box by the Council Officers, the High Priest, King and Scribe ballot. Direction is then given to the Principal Sojourner to place the box upon the altar (never upon the Great Light) or, better, it should be placed upon a small stand, west of the altar, for the balloting by the Companions. By this means a secret bal - lot is assured. Ml present having balloted (not “all who wish to”), the Sentinel, if a member of the Chapter, should be relieved and in - structed by the High rriest before bal - loting. The balloting being declared closed by the High Priest, the Principal Sojourner then carries the ballot-box to the East for the inspection of the Scribe, King and High Priest, in this order.

A ballot, once declared, cannot be reconsidered. A collective ballot may be taken on several petitioners at the discretion of the High Priest with the approval of the Com - panions. The Grand Chapter Constitution clearly defines the procedure on further balloting and rejections. BY-LAWS Any By-Law in conflict with the Consti - tution of the Grand Chapter is void. Whenever a new or an amended By-Law has been adopted by a Chapter, it is the duty of the Secretary to send copies there - of in duplicate, to the Grand Chapter Committee on By-Laws for approval, ac - companied by a certification, over the sig - nature of the Secretary, and the seal of the Chapter. This certificate should show that such action was taken at a duly sum - moned Stated Convocation in accordance with the Chapter By-Laws and give the date when adopted. A copy of the adopted change, and effective date, should be sent to the Chapter members subsequent to ap - 6 A proval by the Grand Chapter Committee on By-Laws, thus informing all members of the action taken. Each High Priest should examine the Chapter Book of By-Laws to become thor - oughly acquainted therewith. It should contain the original By-Laws, each amend - ment thereto, including the ‘date of adop - tion and date of approval by Grand Chapter. For the purpose of confirming the record and for historical purposes, each By-Law proposal should be signed by the appointed Chapter Committee and also the High Priest and Secretary at the time. The Chairman of the Grand Chapter Committee on By-Laws will be glad to as - sist any Chapter in the abridgment and revision of its By-Laws. The By-Laws should include provisions as to: i) day and hour of opening of Stated Convocations ii) fees, amount iii) dues, amount and when payable, and if prorated 7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichti agargus .n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus. n I w. stichtingargus. iii iv I I iv) assessments v) trustees, duties and term vi) finances and auditing vii) Standing Committees and duties thereof It is not necessary to copy the duties of officers which are already listed in the Constitution. However, officers should familiarize themselves with the provisions concerning elective and appointive Com - panions. A complete but inexpensive set of By - Laws can be printed or mimeographed on two sides of an 8½ x 11 sheet, and with two or four folds can be easily handied. Every member should possess a copy of the Chapter By-Laws. He promises to act in accordance therewith. By-Laws are a Constitutional require - ment and their importance should never be overlooked. The binder or book which contains them should be limited strictly to the Chapter By-Laws and should not contain the By-Laws of any other Masonic organization. 8 COMMITTEES The Committees of any Ohapter are useless unless they function. High Priests are urged to appoint only Companions as Chairmen who believe in and will follow through on the purposes of the Commit- )~ tees they are to head. The Chairmanship t of a Committee is an honor but it is a working not an honorary appointment, unless so stated. Committee reports should be made in writing on or before the date set. Reports of the Secretary, Treasurer, Trustees, I Auditors and Standing Committees should follow a similar procedure. Of course, the High Priest should have a copy of the report before its presentation at the Con - vocation. A small committee generally functions best. Rank and file Companions should not only be on the committee but given an opportunity to head it. This is a means of finding officer material and training the Companions for greater servii3e to the Chapter.

Select mem - hers who are not at the Convocation when a committee is suggested. Sell the idea of capability and service and your attend - ance will increase. The Entertainment Committee should be responsible for the social and recrea - tional activities of the Chapter. The Coan - cil Officers will assist greatly if dates and occasions are given the Committee. Among the activities to be planned for the Companions may be skits, dramatic programs, musicales, theatre parties, ladies’ nights, dinners (covered dish sup. pers), games, quiz and patriotic programs and so on. Use of the material in the Service Letters of the Committee on Ma - sonic Education and Service will suggest other ideas. The Finance Committee frequently is given no other task than examining and approving the bills before payment. The Annual Proceedings of Grand Chapter give a splendid picture of the responsibili - ties of the Finance Committee. In many Chapters the Committee is consulted on N investments and in the preparation of the annual budget. This produces interest in the Chapter and attendance at Convoca- tions. An Auditing Com’miittee should be ap - pointed to serve at mid-year and just previous to the Annual Convocation, and, it should submit a written report. Its • duties include an examination and a cross- check of all financial accounts, of the recor~ls of the Secretary and Treasurer, Trustees and of the membership and dues ledgers. The membership of this Com - mittee should exclude all elective officers. The Chapter Self-Studies have indicated the desirability of a semi-annnal audit. It is good business practice to have all deposits made by the Treasurer in the Chapter’s name. Checks should bear the signature of the High Priest and/or the Secretary and Treasurer. Auditing is made easier if all checks are drawn against serially numbered vouchers. A Committee on Mason’ic Education is a MUST in every Chapter.

Such are the aims and pur - poses of the Standing Conimittee of Grand Chapter on Masonic Education and Serv - ice which have been repeatedly stated in fuller form in the Service Letters sent to the Chapters. Freemasons request more and further Light. Most Excellent Masters a~e obli - gated to spread Masonlc Light and Knowledge. We can not impart what we ~ What a challenge to every Compaidon, to every Chairman of the Chapter Committee and to every officer is the matter of Education. The Chapter Committee Chairman should be a Sanctnary Officer (CU., P.S. or R.A.C.) who may well serve for two years. Service and work on the Com - mittee will not only assist the Chapter but benefit every potential presiding offi- cer. Do not limit the size of the Com - mittee — add the workers in the Chapter who participate in the program. The Grand Chapter Committee on 12 N Masonic Education and Service has devel - oped into a working service-station for the Royal Arch Masons in this State. The only motive is a real desire that every one of its services — educational, informa - tional and social activities — be used to the fullest by every Chapter and every member of the Holy Royal Arch. Make personal contact with your Service Man in the district or any member of the Grand Chapter Committee — it is yonr Com - mittee. The High Priest, who should sit in on the meetings of the Committee, will help his program for the year iC he assigns ten minutes or more to the Committee at every Convocation. Following installa - tion the High Priest should notify the Chairman of the Grand Chapter Commit - tee of the name, address and rank of the Chairman he has appointed. A MembersMp Com~mittee should be appointed in every Chapter to assemble information, direct the efforts of the Com - panion Salesmen, co-ordinate their work and, ALL IMPORTANT, promote a defi - 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. n I 4~W~ ~ nite plan of FOLLOW-UP after another dues paying member has been added to the Chapter roster. The new member should be made happy and satisfied with his purchase. Then, he will remain a Companion and a booster, even better, an - other salesman or representative for Ca - pitular Masonry. Other duties of this Committee are to stimulate attendance at Convocations, to sponsor, counsel and instruct new candi - dates, to see to it that every officer, Chap - ter worker and member of the Conunittee always has a current roster, and to visit the delinquent and stay-at-home Com - panions. The High Priest should make certain that every Lodge (where possible) repre - sented on the Chapter roster has a Com- panion therefrom on the Membership Committee. His job should be to keep in contact with his Lodge Brethren as poten - tial Companions. COMMUNICATIONS Communications in writing are essen - tial. Those from the Grand High Priest, 14 • N or from such other officers as he may direct, always shonld be read to the Chap - ter by the High Priest. All communica - tions — from the Grand High Priest, the Grand Officers’, the Official Visitors, and Committees of the Grand Chapter, the Assistant Grand Lecturers and Service Men — should be answered by officers of constituent Chapters fully and promptly. This is essential to the conduct of the af - fairs and business in Grand and local Chapter alike. It is also a matter of common courtesy. CONVOCATIONS. STATED AND SPECiAL The Convocations of a Chapter are of two kinds, Stated and Special, both of which are governed by the By-Laws of the individual Chapter in due conformity with the Grand Chapter Constitution, and approved by the Grand Ohapter Commit - tee on By-Laws. In order to hold its Warrant, a Chapter in this jurisdiction must hold at least two Stated Convocations in each year, and it 15"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"9’ w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n w.stichtingargus. 01 w.stichtingargus. 01 I— j I; 11 -x must meet the Grand Chapter require - ment of being not more than two years in arrears in the payment of the annual Per Capita Tax. A Stated Convocation is one which is held at a stated time, afternoon or eve - ning, and at intervals as indicated in the Chapter By-Laws. Most Chapters find it desirable to hold two Stated Convocations each month. The time and place of the Stated Convocations of every Chapter in the State are printed in the proceedings of the Grand Chapter; Officer personnel is also given. Companions desiring to visit other Chapters within the State should use the data given. Sojourners from other juris - dictions should be sought out by local Companions and given such information in their new residence areas- The notice or call for a Special Convo- cation of a Chapter may be at the pleasure of the High Priest on due and timely no - tice and shall always specify the business to be transacted. Changes of the Stated Convocations of 16 r a Chapter may be made only by amend - ment to the By-Laws as prescribed therein. All Convocations should be opened at the designated hour. A good administra - tor opens a meeting promptly. No busi - ness can be transacted prior to the hour stated in the By-Laws. The Chapter should be closed at a reasonable hour. Prompt opening, a well-organized meet - ing and short ref resh’,nent periods will make early closing possible. The obser - vation of these simple procedures will increase the attendance, as surely as fail- are to observe them will keep members away and be detrimental to the welfare of the Chapter. The elective and appointive officers, duly obligated, are morally bound to be present at the designated opening time of the Chapter. Officers who may be unable to attend should always advise the High Priest in ample time to be excused so that a substitute may be provided. The op - portunity to serve as an officer in a Royal Arch Chapter is a privilege and should be a pleasure. Where duty ends, love begins! 17"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.ni w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus. iii W.Stichtingargus iii Some High Priests exact a promise of prompt attendance at Stated Convoca - tions from all appointive officers (within their cable tows) before the installation ceremonies. Such action emphasizes officer responsibility and tends to create unity. The High Priest may avoid delay and em - barrasement at the meeting by providing alternate officers for each appointive station. DIMIT Any Royal Arch Niason in good stand - ing may, in writing, request a dimit at any stated Convocation, and if his dues are paid in full and no charges pending it must be granted. However, he should be interviewed first by a Companion. If he is indigent, unhappy or feels Chapter has lost interest in him, the matter may thus be resolved without loss of a member. If the Companion is moving to another jurisdiction, the Secretary should give him the name and location of a Chapter in his new Location and then write the Secretary thereof concerning the “So - journer.” The Royal Craft will be made 18 stronger in either case. Once you have exalted a Companion, never let him go! HONORARY MEMBERSHIP Honorary membership may be confer - red by a Chapter upon any Royal Arch Mason in good standing to whom it may wish to extend recognition for good and sufficient reasons. It may be conferred by presentation of a resolution or proposi - tion at a Stated Convocation followed by unanimous ballot at a subsequent Con- vocation. Such honorary memberships should be given sparingly, so that they will be regarded truly as a recognition of Masonic merit and service. An Hon - orary Member is not subject to the pay - ment of dues, and he has no right to vote or participate in the business of the Chapter. He should receive notices and other courtesies as do the other members. After you have honored a Companion do not neglect him. Call upon him to assist in election, installation and other special programs as one of your own. ~19"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. n I w. stichti ngargus. ni w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. ri I INSTALLATiON — REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING The annual installation of the Officers of a Chapter is done by the retiring High Priest, or his P~st High Priest proxy. (Past and Present Grand Chapter Offi- cers are always willing to assist when re - quested.) Section 35 of the Constitution reads: “The installation of the Officers of a Chapter shall take place at the time of election or on or before the next stated convocation, and no officer can be in - stalled by proxy.” The Constitution, Section 36, needs no explanation regarding failure to elect and install. It reads: “If, at the time pre - scribed, a Chapter shall fail to elect its officers, or within the time prescribed shall fail to install its (executive) officers or any of them, or if, having elected its officers at the prescribed time, any of them shall fail or refuse to be installed within the prescribed time, the Grand IHigh Priest, or the Deputy Grand High Priest, may grant a dispensation to such Chapter to elect or to install such officer, 20 N N N or officers, as the exigencies of the case may reqiilre. Appointive officers may be installed by the High Priest or his proxy at any stated Convocation. The ceremonies of installa - tion always must take place in a duly opened Chapter, and in our jurisdiction, never in public. The installation of a new Chapter is done by the Grand High Priest, or his proxy. MERiTORIOUS COMPANiON A certificate of merit was established by Grand Chapter in 1936. The award is restricted to a Companion, who has never presided as High Priest, but who has by a record of unusual loyalty, perseverance, courage and dependability become a mem - ber of distinction and worthy of “merit”. The Companion recommended for this honor must be in good standing in the Chapter and have (a) rendered excep - tional service to or shown a real loyalty to his Masonic organizations; (b) rendered outstanding service to his community, state or the nation; (c) performed an act 21"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargu s.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. siichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.n I w.stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus iii (ii I - ‘I of heroism, which was over and above the duties of his. position.

MINUTES AND RECORDS The minutes are not only the authorita - tive record of a Chapter’s activities, bat the principal source of historical data of the Chapter from organization onward. The minutes are the only continuous record of the Chapter’s activities. Hence they should be accurate, complete, neatly prepared and carefully preserved. Grand Chapter requires a Chapter to provide the Secretary with the following: (1) A Seal for authentication (2) A Record or Minute Book (3) A Book of By-Laws, for the signa - ture of each Companion Exalted or Affiliated 22 (4) (5) (6) N A Chapter Register of Membership A Book of Marks A Book for the alphabetical listing of Expulsions, Suspensions and Rejections. The Chapter should also provide a place for the safe-keeping of all records, includ - ing space for records and material of his - torical value. This’ matter should be so stored that the Chapter historian may use it in his work. PARLIAMENTARY LAW The usual rules of parliamentary prac - tice (Robert’s Rules of Order or another) shall be the guide for the presiding officer in the Chapter insofar as they agree with Masonic usage. There must be no conflict with the By-Laws of the (~onstituent Chapter or the Constitution Rules and Regulations of Grand Chapter. The Order of Business may be changed by the High Priest when in his judgment it will be best for the good and welfare ~f the Chapter.

PETiTIONS The controls of admission to a Royal Arch Chapter are contained in Sections 57-66 of the Grand Chapter Constitution. Not only should each Officer familiarize himself therewith but instruction, by di - rect reading, should be given to the Com - panions. A petition may be received only at a Stated Convocation. Never at a Special Convocation! The report of a committee of investigation can only be acted upon at a Stated Convocation. The investigation of a petitioner should not be perfunctory. The committee of in - vestigatio n, as a whole, or individually, shoald personally interview the applicant. The applicant will remember the investi - 24 —U gation when he sought to become a Ma - son. Guard well the inner door! Attend - ance will improve and there will be fewer N.P.ft’s and dimits on the Chapter in the Secretary’s records. Incidentally, once he becomes a candidate all should acquaint themselves with him. Make him feel he is wanted. He will respond by becoming an active member—not one who just belongs. A committee of investigation is re - quired to report its findings in writing to the Chapter at a Stated Convocation with - in a month (except during a recess), but never to any individual. The report in itself, favorable or unfavorable, shall not be sufficient to elect or reject a petitioner. The Chapter alone shall decide. The bal - lot is the only means by which any peti - ~ioner is accepted or rejected. Except as to age, Masonic standing and i~esidence, the Chapter is the sole judge of the qualifications — physical, moral and oLherwise — of a petitioner. The mini• mum fee for admission is determined by Orand Chapter. 25"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w,stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. .stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. n I w. stichti ngargus. n w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtmgargus.ri I PUBLIC RELATIONS The world at large judges Royal Arch Masonry by the words, actions and atti - tudes of the individual member. The Royal Arch Chapter, as such, also affects the public opinion of the Capitular Rite. Thas Masonic relations, public relations and proper publicity become a factor in Chapter administration. Public relations has to do with the whole body of contacts between any two or more given societies or organizations and all other segments of the general public with which it has, or seeks to have, contacts. In a sense, Freemasonry lines up with all bodies, religious’ and secular, which unite themselves in promoting the idea of a brotherhood or man under the Fatherhood of God. The function of public relations is to establish some general accord with other systems of reciprocal interest. In other words, public relations has to do with general and basic principles. Publicity assumes that such accord is actual or potential, and thus applies it- 26 self to the minute details of communica - tion. Publicity has to do only with the means whereby such a body endeavors to make specific contacts. Publicity should deal only on the much narrower channel of a community of in - terest in a given neighborhood or society, as for example, those manifested alike by Masons and other fraternal and civic groups or bodies. Publicity is to public relations what a bucksaw is to a cord or wood. It is of the utmost importance that these terms shall never become confused. Public relations establish the background; publicity assumes the existence of such a background but never presumes upon more than its general significance.

SERVICE CERTIFICATES By action of the Grand Chapter in t943 Companions who have been in good stand - ing in this jurisdiction for an aggregate period of fifty (SQ) years are entitled to the award of a certificate from Grand Chapter attesting to this fact. (Applications for such 50-year certifi - cates should be made to the Grand See - retary, who upon verification will cause the certificate to be eccecuted.) Such certificates, as with the certificate for Meritorious Companion, should al - ways be presented by a Grand Chapter Officer or a permanent member or Grand Chapter. This ceremony or presentation can well be made one of the finest meet- 28 ings of the year with an appropriate program. Some Chapters have the commendable custom of presenting 25-year certificates to Companions entitled to them by con - tinuous membership in good standing for a period of twenty-five years. Write the Grand Secretary for fwrther particulars. SERVICE MAN A Service Man is appointed, with the approval of the Grand High Priest, in each Lecture District as the personal con - tact Companion in the Chapters for the Grand Chapter Committee on Masonic Education and Service. The High Priest and the Chairman of the Chapter Com - mittee should work closely with the Service Man. He has no honorary title.

The High Priest is presumed to be a man of integrity who has attained the highest position in his Chapter by proving himself worthy of the title of Excellent.. His qualities should be emulated by all who aspire to positions of government. The High Priest should be a model of Masonic dignity, loyalty, and dependa - bility, possessing qualities of leadership that would insure the success of any en - terprise he might sponsor. He is a man of humility who was drafted (did not seek) into high places because of his abil - ity and willingness to serve. His main (~oncern is for the good of his Companions rather than for personal gratification. A High Priest must be a practical leader not afraid to assume the responsi. bility of ‘his stewardship.

He makes a contribution to Capitular Masonry. Add to all these qualities a pleasing personality with tolerance and respect for others, a sense of humor, a love of truth, and a devotion to the ideals’ of Royal Arch Masonry and you have the pattern of a leader and a good executive for any suc - cessful Chapter.

The Grand Captain of the Host, or his proxy, always apprises the High Priest of the presence of the Grand High Priest as follows: The alarm having been given and response made, the Grand Captain of the Host enters the Chapter going directly to the altar, salutes and declares, “The Grand High Priest of the Grand Chapter of the State of New York, Royal Arch Masons, is about to enter,” note that his name is not given as it is assumed all know it. After the Grand Captain of the Host has entered the Chapter room, the door is left open until the Grand High Priest has been escorted into the Chapter. The High Priest (upon the entrance of the Grand Captain of the Host) calls up the Chapter and all remain standing until the ceremonies of reception have been completed. The Grand Captain of the Host escorts the Grand High Priest to the altar (without any comment) where both salute the High Priest. They 34 proceed to the East, where the Grand High Priest is received by the High Priest with a grip, but there are no remarks. The Grand Captain of the Host immediately steps to the front of the dais and declares: “Companions, Private Grand Honors.” He then assumes the station of the Cap - tam of the Host, so acts and remains there until such time as the Grand High Priest after returning the gavel shall leave the platform, or shall indicate to his officer the desire to retire from the Chapter. (Announcement of the retirement of the Grand High Priest and his staff from the meeting is made by the Grand Captain of the Host.) GRAND HONORS Grand Honors are a mark of honor and respect and should not be abused by ex - tending them without good reason, but failure to extend when due is equally poor taste. They are always to be extended to Past and Present Grand Officers of the Grand Chapter, Official Visitors and to those Grand Officers who visit from other Grand Chapters. 35"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n[ w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu sn[ w,stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n[ w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus. n I w. stichtingargu s. iii w.stichtingargus.ii I ~~1 4 Since all High Priests are members of the Grand Chapter during their term of office, it is courteous and proper to extend Grand Honors to them, when visiting a Chapter other than their own. All Right Eccellents receive the same courtesy. This is done at the discretion of the High Priest of the Chapter but not by the High Priest. Grand Honors should be extended to a member when created a Meritorious Companion, to one awarded a 50-year cer - tificate or to a distinguished guest of the Chapter. The Companions are led in extending Grand Honors by the escorting officer be he the Grand Captain of the Host, Cap - tain of the Host, or one so acting. Grand Honors may be extended others at the discretion of the High Priest. HIGH PRIEST. THE Every High Priest should review the questions found in the Chapter Guide which must be answered in the affirma - tive upon installation. A prospective pre - siding officer might well consider the same 36 N questions before installation. The High Priest selects pro tempore officers when necessary. No officer auto - matically succeeds to a vacant station, although he should be prepared to fill at least the next station. In case of the death or absence of the High Priest, the Ring or, in his absence, the Scribe, will serve as High Priest dur - ing such vacancy or absence. He does not acquire the title of Excellent High Priest by such service. While presiding, the offi - cer is addressed as Excellent High Priest. All Companions respect the several sta - tions -of the officers. All Grand Officers out• rank the Officers of a constituent Chapter and should be given every cour• tesy becoming the Grand Body they repre~ sent. A line or service officer will ever remember that he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and that arbitrary con - (luct or unwarranted assumption of au - thority is never justified by the accident of preferment. This attitude is a mark of leadership. 37"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichti ngargus.n[ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. ii I w.stichtingargus ri I F The High Priest should review with the Secretary all correspondence which may come before the Chapter, prior to the opening hour. The business will then be transacted with dignity, understanding and dispatch. The High Priest shonid familiarize himself with the history and traditions of his Chapter. He should consult the Secre - tary regularly (not only on meeting nights) to keep himself informed regard - ing all financial transactions, dues pay - ments, dues delinquencies and other transactions that affect his administra - tion. He should also check the annual inven - tory of all Chapter and ritual parapher - nalia, jewels and furniture at the close of his term of office so that his successor may know exactly what materials he in - herits from the preceding administrative year. This custom shonid be perpetuated by each successive officer and the records of inventory dated and kept in the Secre - tary’s files. 38 N HONORS. PRIVATE GRAND Private Grand Honors are the prop - erty of the Grand High Priest of the Grand Chapter of the State of New York, Royal Arch Masons. Only as long as he serves as Grand High Priest is he entitled to receive them. Upon retirement from that office, he shall receive Grand Honors. Private Grand Honors are given under the direction of the Grand Captain of the Host, or the Acting Grand Captain of the Host (who is always designated by the Grand High Priest) - These honors are reserved for the Grand High Priest of the State of New York and are never to be given to a visiting Grand High Priest. The General Grand High Priest receives Grand Honors. SECRETARY. THE The Secretary is the business man of the Chapter.

Filling in the blank spaces on the printed page of a general record is a small part of his duties. Among the qualities of a good Secre - tary are: a) punctuality and regularity of attendance at Convocations; b) cor - rectness and completeness in recording the proceedings — noting the attendance, the names and titles of visitors, record - ing the pertinent remarks of Companions and speakers, and the details of income and disbursements; c) tact and thorough - ness in checking all bills; d) noting and reporting dues arrearages; e) mainte - nance of the membership ledger, Mark Book and other records; f) completeness and promptness in making the official annual returns to Grand Chapter. In the exercise of these qualities the Secretary will compose a permanent record and basis for the history of the Chapter. The Secretary has the most continuous oeficer contact with the membership. The far-away Companion, and he who seldom comes to the Tabernacle, in addition to getting the Chapter notice, always hears 40 from the Secretary about dues. Here the Secretary becomes the fraternal relations ambassador. In actual practice the efficient discharge of a Secretary’s duties requires talents and skills worthy of a statesman and a good Secretary is a joy forever. TITLES The official title of the Grand High Priest of the State of New York, Royal Arch Masons is ilIost Excellent Com - panion. This title is held also by every Past Grand High Priest. All Grand Offi - cers below the rank of Grand High Priest hold the title of Right Excellent Com - panion. The Grand Sentinel’s title is Ex - cellent Com~panion. Those who have been honored by bestowal of a commission have the title of Right Excellent Companion, during and after the period for which their commission is in effect. Assistant Grand Lecturers are given the title of Very Excellent Companion. A Companion who has been issued a Certificate of Merit has the title of Meritorious Companion. 41"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .n1 w. stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I wstichtingargus.n I w. stichti ngargus. ii I w.stichtingargus. ii 4.

TRUSTEES, THE Most Chapter By-Laws provide for a Board of Trustees consisting of three members. Each Trustee serves a three- year term, with one term expiring each year. It is a noticeable fact that in many Chapters, the election to the Board of Trustees is naught but a complimentary gesture to the retiring High Priest. The appointment of a Chaplain and the elec - tion of a Treasurer are often gestures of affection. All are serious and responsible jobs requiring qualified personnel. Trustees and their duties are stated in Section 5 of the Benevolent Orders Law under which The Grand Chapter of the State of New York, Royal Arch Masons, is incorporated. Constituent Chapters are not under that Law unless they have filed the necessary certificate. Trustees for their own protection should act on investments only as voted, author- 42 ized and directed by the Chapter to pur - chase and/or sell securities specifically. The Chapter should not delegate its au - thority or discretion’ to the Trustees or a Finance Committee as to the sale or purchase of securities held or to be held by or on behalf of the Chapter. Any well- qualified Companion should be given an opportunity to serve as Trustee even thongh not a Past High Priest. In small Chapters the Trustees may serve also as a Finance Committee whose duty would be to make recommendations to the Chapter. Some responsibilities of the Trustees should be — a) to have charge of the per - manent or reserve fund; b) to invest in stocks, bonds, mortgages and the like which are legal for investment for Say - [ngs Banks’ in New York as and when voted by the Chapter; c) responsibility for the purchase, handling and upkeep of paraphernalia, property and equipment of the Chapter (money should be provided in the budget); and d) 5 nch other duties as may be desirable for a particular Chapter. 43"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. sti chtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargusn I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. iil w.stichtingargus. ri I The Chairman of the Grand Chapter Committee on By-La~ws will be pleased to assist by recommending an appropriate amendment to your By-Laws, as to Trus - tees if requested to do so.

Trustees who do not work should be replaced. TRUSTEESHIP IS IrV[PORTANT. VISITORS. OFFICIAL The Official Visitor represents the Grand Chapter and brings with him a message from the Grand High Priest. The hour of entrance is not later than 9 P. M. The Official Visitor is designated by the Grand High Priest and he may be a Present or Past Grand Officer. The purpose of an Official Visitation is three-fold: 44 i) To provide an enthusiastic meeting that shall be an inspiration to good work and better attendance during the entire year. Written notice of Official Visitations should be sent to each member. ii) To afford the Grand Officer and the Companions in the Chapter, with the visiting Companions, an opportunity to become acquainted. iii) The several visitations of each Grand Officer afford occasions for wider study. The Grand Officer comes to know, at first hand, ‘something of the peculiar problems facing the indi - vidual Chapters. Mutual understand - ing and cooperative solutions, follow - ing discussion, tend to build effective leadership. Fraternal visitations of constituent Chapters offer similar op - portunity to all officers concerned. No one stands alone!

The Visitor will review each item and, where necessary, discuss it with the Council Officers when he arrives at the place of visitation, offering advice and suggestions~. An inspection may, if agreeable to the Visitor, be held at a special or stated con - vocation. In anticipation of the Visita - tion, all necessary preparation should be made to open the Chapter on time and to expedite the business and the reception of the guests. A copy of the program of the evening should be submitted to the Visitor for his approval before he makes the Visi - tation - No entertainment, other than a solo or a musical number, should be in - cluded in the Chapter room program. Similar courtesies should be extended to a guest speaker. The records and other matter indicated on the Advance Report Forms must be laid out for checking and examination by the Official Visitor. I 46 Visiting High Priests and other guests may be asked to speak before the entrance of the Official Visitor. Past and Present Grand Officers will be called upon by the Visitor who is always the last speaker. All announcements should be made before he is extended the gavel.

The Official form for the introduction of an Official Visitor is to be found a few pages further on in this Manual. The Official Visitor will need an hour or more with the High Priest and Secre - tary for the examination of the records and the discussion of Chapter activities.

Its apex faces toward the East. Its relation to the Veils and to the Sanctuary is explained at Grand Lecturer’s Conventions. On the Altar rests the Holy Bible which sends out its rays of truth and Light. The Great Light is~ the nucleus of all Masonic life and the point within the circle of our Brotherhood. An appropriate Altar cloth or mourning drape are the only coverings permitted. The Altar must not be covered by the national flag or any other such emblem at anytime. Before reading the names of departed Companions the High Priest shall raise the Chapter. Then he orders the Captain of the Host to see that the Altar is draped for a period of thirty days.

Historically this is what is meant by being properly clothed. When a Chapter or the Officers of a Chapter plan to attend a Craft Lodge as Royal Arch Masons, it is necessary to obtain permission from the Master of that Lodge, before wearing Royal Arch aprons. This is the Master’s prerogative. Such visitations are desirable Masonic activity for both Craft Lodge and Royal Arch Chapter. Wearing the scarlet bordered apron is a commendable practice as Ma - sonic education for the Blue Lodge Mason. The badge of his office is presented to each officer upon installation in Grand or constituent Chapter. It is commonly re - referred to as a Jewel of office. Each has significance and should be worn by the proper officer.

These jewels should be worn by the Offi- cers (including Grand) at all the Convo- cations of a Chapter (and in all degrees) Grand and Past Grand Officers and Past High Priests should wear their aprons at Convocations, not only because of office held but because it is inspirational to the Companions. CANDIDATES, INSTRUCTION Each Chapter shall provide a Standing Committee, of which the Chapter Lec - turer shall be an ex-officlo member, on the 52 instruction of its candidates. Question and Answer Lectwre pamphlets have been provided by this Grand Chapter to assist in such instruction and may be secured from the Assistant Grand Lecturer or the office of the Grand Secretary. Instruction of candidates affords an opportunity to put Companions to work. This is a test of leadership. Individual instruction is desirable. However, if there is more than one candi - date, then time and space should be ar - ranged to meet with the Standing Com - mittee on Instruction. There are many advantages of group instruction in addi - tion to the ease of learning. Friendship, a sense of belonging to the Chapter, the op - portunity to learn some of the history of the Holy Royal Arch and its importance to Freemasonry, the interpretation of the ritual and getting a knowledge of the indi - vidual Chapter by the new Brother — are but a few benefits derived when a commit - tee serves well. 53 )"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtin~argus iii DEGREE CONFERRAL Every Chapter shall adopt and practice the Standard Work and Lectures as pro - mulgated by this Grand Chapter and ex - emplified by the Grand Lecturer, tinder direction of the Committee on Rituals, in District Conventions, or in Schools of Instruction by the Assistant Grand Lec - turers under the direction of the Grand Lecturer. [A neglect or refusal to practice the Standard Work as promulgated by this Grand Chapter is an act for which a warrant (charter) may be forfeited. (Sec. 46 of the Constitution.)] Degrees in a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons are conferred, not communicated, and every candidate is a participant in the Work. He is entitled to have the words spol~en with clarity, meaning and sine cerity so that he knows “what it is all about.” The officer taking part in a degree shall study the meaning as well as the cor - rect pronunciation, enunciation, and or - der of the words. A candidate will not appreciate what he cannot hear or under - stand. 54 N Any team must practice if it is to perform creditably. Such practice, or rehearsal, under the direction of the Chapter Lecturer should always be held before conferring any degree. Not only will the candidate get more out of the conferral, but so also will every one of the officers. We have the exemplification of the vari - ous degrees in Convention to teach, in - struct and acquire Masonic knowledge by way of the ritual. The ritual contains all that is necessary for impressive work. Innovations or “stunts” are strictly for - bidden. The ritual of the Grand Chapter may not be perfect, but if properly exempli fled, the teachings of Freemasonry are impor - tant and essential in the building of the temple of life. Properly done the candi - date will see the actual character por - trayed. Orators are not necessary, but sincerity of purpose is fundamental.

The Grand Lecturer is required by the Constitution to hold at least one Conven - lion in each Lecture District each year for the purpose of examining the exemplifica - tion of the Standard Work. He selects the Chapter, or Chapters and the Taber - nacle in which the work is to be done. The date of each Convention is to be set by him well in advance of the lime the work is to be reviewed. He assigns the work that shall be done in each of the degrees. The Officers of each Chapter are subject to an assignment in the exemplification of the work in a Convention. it is required that the Officers of all Chapters shall at - tend and take part in the work. The Com - panions are urged to attend. Convention dates have been carefully co-ordinated with the Grand High Priest’s assignments of Official Visitations.

No excuse, therefore, can be ac - cepted claiming ignorance of the time and place of assignment of the work at a Dis - trict Convention by Chapter officers or Companions. The avoidance of conflicts can be a real contribution to the com - munity by the High Priest. The Chapters should publicize the Dis• trict Conventions in their notices, in the public press, and by sending cards to the Officers and members; by calling them on the telephone and/or by personal contact. Chapters are morally bound to make it possible for their members to attend Con• ventions. Should a Convention date fall on the same day as that of a Chapter’s Stated Convocation, so far as it is possi. ble, such Chapter shall shorten or suspend 58 that ConvocatLon to attend the Conven - tion. The same holds true for the Official Visitation. The Chapt.er in whose Tabernacle the Convention is to be held shall transact its business expeditiously. The Grand Lecturer will open the Convention not later than 8:30 i. a~t. Please govern your - self accordingly. This will make it p0551 - ble to close early, have a social and ques - tion period and permit the Companions who have travelled some distance to de - part at a reasonable hoar. Any Companion accepting a part in the work is expected to perform his duty. Should he be unable to attend, within the length of his cable tow, he should inform the High Priest of his Chapter. ft is not always possible to find a substitute to fill a vacancy on short notice. To select a Companion to take a part at the last moment is neither wise nor good pracice. OfYicers and Companions, alike, should realize that the ultimate purpose of a Convention is not merely to make sure that the Chapters adhere to the Stand- 59"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargus .nl wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I wstichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus nl w•stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus nl w. stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI wstichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nJ w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargusn I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n 1 w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. n I ard Work, but also to encourage pride, thought and understanding of the Com - panions who shall be and are engaged in the performance of that work.

It is essential that this officer should have a permanent tenure of office, so far as practicable:’ Such Chapter Lecturer should perforce work with and under the direction of the Assistant Grand Lecturer of the District. The dnties of this officer are to super - vise the rehearsals of Chapter officers, making such corrections as may be neces~ sary; to have direction over the instruc - tion of candidates and certify their pro 6- 60 ciency to the High Priest. He shonld be one whose knowledge of the Ritual is ‘well established, and who is prompted by a desire to be of service, but none of the foregoing releases the High Priest of his responsibility.

EXEMPLIFICATION OF A ritual is something repeated over and over again, always in the same form. Yet, ritual is something more than repeti - tion. At least such is the case with Masonic ritual. Our ritual contains many instructions to the candidate concerning his etiquette, conduct and behavior as a Man and Mason. It also contains much of the symbolism, ethics and philosophy of the Craft. Actually, a ritual is a rite or form of instruction. This is what we do with our ritual during an exemplifica - tion—we instruct. Ritual is not an end in itself but a means, a method, used by all ages of mankind in all activities which have to do with human affairs and behavior. It is used in Capitular Masonry and else - where to give meaning to the forms and ceremonies. The ritual is the vehicle, the vestibule—indeed, the very So al of Free - masonry. A deliberate cultivation of be - havior both in officers and members re - sults when the ritual is properly executed and understood. 66 -q The exemplification of a degree in Chapter, School of Instruction or Con - vention is not only a rehearsal of parts but the performing officers and observers get the “know-how” of delivery, interpre - tation and general performance. They become the “characters”, not merely some - one speaking the lines. SCHOOL OF INSTRUCTION Several Schools of Instruction exist throughout the state for the express pur - pose of aiding the Chapters. They are supported and maintained by voluntary contributions from the Chapters in the District and the Companions. The Grand Lecturer may visit them from time to time to supervise the Standard Work and to offer constructive suggestions concerning school operation. Each School is governed by a set of By. Laws approved by the Grand Chapter Committee on Ritual and the Grand Chapter Committee on By-Laws. These By-Laws may be obtained from the Grand Lecturer’s office. 6’1"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.ni w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus .n I w.stichtin~argus. iii / I The President presides over the School program which may include discussion periods centering around the administra - tive duties of a High Priest and his prerogatives ; Constitutional requirements governing a High Priest; the program of the Grand High Priest and that of the Committee on Masonic Education and Service; auditing, finance and other re - ports.

The delegation may in - dude in order of entrance (each group with an individual escort), Companions, Past and Present High Priests, former and present Right and Very Excellents. Following the salute, each group is intro - duced and greeted from the East. Grand Honors are accorded collectively where due. Appropriate response may be made by the head of the leading group while West of the Altar. All should be escorted to the East and extended the hand of fel - lowship with the High Priest on the level. Do not have too many delegations. The time schedule will determine the number of groups. The Companions will arrive early and come again if your program starts promptly. As every Council Officer should attend the Grand Chapter Annual Convocation, a word as to procedure may be in order: Following pronouncement by the Grand 71"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. sti chtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. iii Captain of the Host, the Grand Chapter Officers enter, the Grand High Priest, being escorted last by the Grand Captain of the Host. The visiting delegations from sister Grand Chapters enter in order of date of their constitution — the youngest first and the oldest last. This protocol is followed in most jurisdictions. An ob - servance of this procedure will add to your pleasure while in attendance at Grand Chapter. Grand Honors for all are under the direction of the Grand Captain of the Host. The practice of receiving a Companion as Past High Priest, again as Right Ex - cellent and perhaps several times more in order to recognize other honors and titles he may have received should be avoided as it is time-consuming and unfair to the Distinguished Visitor. It is suggested that the Distinguished Visitor be received but once with the group in which protocol would place him or as he may select. Proper planning will make it possible for the escorting officer to mention other dele - gations of which the Companion might 72 have been a member, with his appropriate titles. It is suggested that only the head of the Masonic organization — District, State or otherwise — be received individually. Past and Present Grand Officers are always received as a separate delegation. Position in the line when being escorted into the Chapter room is the reverse of the listing found in the Proceedings of Grand Chapter. A nice custom is to have the Senior Past Grand High Priest present enter as the head of the delega - tions, under escort. It is courteous and proper to introduce him as Most Excel - lent , Grand High Priest, 19..., rather than Past Grand High Priest. The Companions present will not then ask, “When was he in the Grand East?” (the year for each is in the Proceedings’) and it is a compliment due the distinguished visitor. The ranking Grand Officer should be the last personage received by the High Priest or presiding officer. He will then be at the immediate right of the High 73"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. st ichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. sti chti ngargus.n I w.stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtin~argus. n I Priest in the East. Following Grand Honors led by the Captain of the Host or escorting officer, the High Priest, with perhaps a request for a few remarks, then will hand the gavel to the ranking officer who should seat the Companions. Be sure each escorting officer gives the secretary a written list of all in his group for inclusion in the minutes — name, titles, location. Every visitor should sign the “Visitors Register” before entering the Tabernacle. This is part of the history of the Chapter. SPEAKERS In engaging a speaker — Grand Officer, the Mayor or any other — care should be taken to give blin all necessary informa - tion including: i) The place and circumstances under which he will speak. (A tiled meet - ing; a~i open meeting; ladies present; any other speakers and so on.) ii) The purpose for which the meeting is to be held. 74 iii) The subject upon which the speech is to be based. iv) The time, place and hour of intro - duction. v) Information about transportation train or plane schedule or best route by highway. vi) Place and hour of dinner and with whom if the speaker comes from a distance. All arrangements should be confirmed in writing. Grand Chapter does not provide ex - pense coverage for special Chapter pro - grams at which a Grand Officer is asked to speak. When a speaker has not indi - cated that he expects a fee, strict care should be taken promptly to reimburse him for his expenses. (Time and distance affect transportation costs, meals, hotel accommodations, taxi fares and inciden - tals.) Many fine Masonic speakers are not rich in this world’s goods. Treat him as your guest. He may be able to accept an invitation to return or agree to speak elsewhere. 75"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"p w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.ii I w.stichtingargus. ii If a fee has been agreed upon it should be paid the same night. Incidentally, the High Priest or one representing him should meet and leave the speaker at the station or at the hotel. The speaker’s name and tl~ie title of his address should be prominently printed in the body of the notice. He should receive a copy of that and the succeeding notice. Common courtesy demands a crowded Tabernacle. A letter of appreciation should always be sent to the Guest• Speaker after he has come and gone. One of the essentials of hospitality to a Guest-Speaker is to see that he is intro - duced at the time appointed. In return he will repay the courtesy by making it equally important to stop on time. VISITING OUTSIDE JURISDICTION When arranging a group visit to, or receiving such a visit from, a Chapter in another Grand Jurisdiction it is neces - sary that permission be obtained and ar - ranged through the Grand Secretary’s 76 Office. Should it be the desire to have the Grand High Priest accompany a Chapter on such a visit to another Jurisdiction, or to have the Grand High Priest of another Grand Jurisdiction accompany one of his Chapters on a visit to this Grand Juris - diction, arrangements must be cleared with the Grand Secretary’s Office. The heads of Grand Chapters usually have their dates booked months’ in advance. An early request is more likely to receive at - tention than a late one. (Also, see ruling ou dispensations.)

The Service Letters have sug - gested over 100 programs. Proper programnting is not the only answer to the tn-headed bogie of candi - dates, enthusiasm and inevitable improved Chapter attendance.

The books are well chosen; there are beginners and advanced courses; and the only cost is the si ight mail charge when returning the books for those that are to follow. Reading Masons are active Masons. Registration blanl~s should be on the Secretary’s desk and both new and old Companions should be encouraged to en - roll for the Course. The Royal Arch Read - ing Course is a MUST for every officer and member of the Chapter Committee on Masonic Education and Service. SERVICE LETTERS The Service Letters cover a wide field of material. It is not expected that every High Priest will use all the suggestions but be is entitled a full opportunity of selection. A wise Line Ofilcer will make himself thoroughly acquainted with the 84 working tools available. The Binder containing the Service Let - ters and all material issued by the Grand Chapter Committee should not only be read by each Chapter Officer but should be a topic of discussion at officers’ meet - ings. The Chapter copy of this Binder is to be transmitted to successive High Priests following their installation. THE ROYAL ARCH MASON THE ROYAL ARCH MASON is the official organ of the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons. While primarily directed toward Royal Arch Masons its reading matter is of interest to Free - masons around the world. The magazine is published quarterly in Trenton, Mis - souri. Subscription rates are scaled from One Dollar ($1.00) for a two-year sub - scription to Ten Dollars ($10.00) for a life subscription.

The Landmarks have been dis - cussed by many writers and numbered from four to the fifty-foQr of John W. Simons in Masonic Jurisprudence. Some Grand Lodges and some Grand Chapters list some Landmarks, but there is no uni - formity. Pound, in his Jurisprudence, says: “For myself, I should recognize seven land - marks, which might be put summarily as follows: (1) Belief in God; (2) belief in the persistence of personality; (3) a ‘book of law’ as an indispensable part of the furniture of every lodge; (4) the legend of the third degree; (5) secrecy; (6) the symbolism of the operative art; and (7) that a Mason must be a man freeborn and of age.

But these seem doabtful to me, and doubt is a sufficient warrant for referring them to the cate - gory of conimon law.” “Belief in God, the G.A.O.T.Th,” says Brother George F. Moore, “is the first landmark of Freemasonry.” Doubtless Mackey would have agreed, though in his list it bears the number nineteen. Hence, the Landmark is a fine topic for the Masonic Education Committee in any Chapter. Fundamental to Capitular Masonry, of which Most Excellent Charles J. Wells, P.G.H.P. says, “The ritual is but the ves - tibule to the real realm of Masonry” ~s Article 2, in the Articles of Union between the two Grand Lodges of England in 1813, reading: “It is declared and pronounced that pure ancient Masonry consists of three degrees, and no more; namely, those of the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Mason, including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch.” 106 SOURCES FOR BOOKS, PAMPHLETS AND MATERIAL In addition to the books in the Read - ing Coarse, the Grand Chapter of the State o ~New York has a Royal Arch Sec - tion, Museum and Library.
