Au investigation into the histoi ical i amificatioiis covering Knights Templar Priests might be cornpaied with trying to pre - sent an hustoiical treatise on the Rose Cioix degiee—a degiee found iii more systems and rites ol Masonry than any other— it is even found outside of the Masonic systems. The names applied to the Knights Templar Piiests degiee are confusing: White Masons, Templar Piiests, Asiatic Biethren, and otheis, and sometimes the degree known as Knight Templar Priests is totally unlike that which we so consider today. Even the bodies in which the degree was conferred go under different names— Melchiseclek Lodges, White Lodges, Conclaves, Conventions, Union Bands, Tabernacles, and what not. Many times we are not sure we are talking about the same degree which we are now considering. This is, as some of us know, true in many other cases—the Rose Croix, the Red Cross degree, the Mark degree and ad infinitum. For thc sake of covci age, a tcw notes concerning statements made by wi ltd S on this subject as ~t concei im thc degi uc out - side of the English-speaking countiies are set down: Some wiuters (1) have connected the Templar Priest degree with the Asiatic Brethren, a body having its center in Vienna, with a certain Baron von Eckhofen at its head. This Order, it has been suggested, could be a continuation of the “Brothers of the Golden and Rosy Cross,” which itself was a revival of the 17th century Rosicrucians organized in 1710 by a Saxon priest, Samuel Richter, known as Sincerus Renatus. Asiatic Brethrcn ai e also titlcd “Knights and Brethren of St. John the Evangelist,” but since Jews and others not Christians were admitted to the Order, this Johannite inspiration is impos - tuie. The bodies were known as “Melchisedek Lodges” or true “Biothers of thc Rose Croix.” Karl A. Bohernann (2) attempt - ed to establish the Oider in Sweden about the end ol the 18th centuiy.

Whatever selation, if any, this group A had to our Priestly Order is ohscui e Fi ankly, I consider it K apart from more than a root idea and wiii diop the subject. A Arthur Edward Waite (3), using Yarker and Hughan as authorities, states that the former writer concludes that the i cal] Priestly Order was once practiced in Ireland and formed a part bool of the system of the York Grand Lodge Hughan objects to the M ,ir York origin. In one system, under the name of Knight Templar Priest or Holy \\A,Jisdom, the degree was the last off our super- .~ I imposed upon the Craft degrees, and conferred in a Taber- j7~ nacle. Waite says. “The Early Grand Scottish Rite conferred ~ all the Grades, but not in a direct sequence, and that of Knight (I,ltt( Templar Priest constituted the 41st degree, under the title of icad “Priestly Order, or White Masons “ Continues Waite (4): “It is imbedded in the cumbrous and inchoate system of the Early Grand Rite, like a cornerstone laid in Zion (elect and precious).” In the Early Grand Rite, the 42d degree is Priest of the Sun In mad it the candidate is conducted by Truth from Angel to Angel, in I. virtue of successive Masonic qualifications and titles. When he reaches the seventh Angel it is as a Knight Temp lar Priest that the candidate is presented to Saphael, t~e President of Saturn, [clii who iecalls to him that the peace-makers are children of God. If we consider these degrees following in proper numerical cider—which mostly they do not—we find here a foreshadow- TI ing from these woi ds found in a ritual of 1813, No. 41 of the J ER Early Grand Rite. No Us i r “And the philosophers say that the Sun is a body containing heat and calc light and by sending forth hi.s influence throughont creation invigorates Lod and enliveneth all th,ng~ therein in due ~ea~on.

This may or may not mean something. John Yarker, English Masonic wiitei, who might be considered to be “on the two sam wrong side of the blanket” in Freemasonry in England—an ex - pression he once applied to Thomas Dunckerley for a different TI reason, however—believes the date is correct.

The first name is that of J olin MeDougal. of Manchester, whose (late is June 1815. The next entry is 1839, which makes a twenty-fouI year gap. The ritual and set of laws is for the TABERNACLE OF JERUSALEM UNDER THE CONCLAVE OF SAINT JOHN, No. 9, instituted A.L 5817, A 0. 605, K.T.P. 127, AD. 1813. Using 4004 as the year of light and the other usual figures to calculate, the year comes out 1813 in each case. However, the Lodge figure used is 1723. The Temple figure 1118 is not used at all. This Conclave, under which the Priestly Order was held, was instituted in Manchester, England, May 20, 1795. It appears to have been in abeyance and ievived in 1813, soon after which the Priestly Ordes Tabernacle was established. Thus we have two Tabernacles of the Priestly Order in Manchaster about the same time. The Os dci was kept alive in England by the Royal Kent Tabernacle at Newcastle-on-Tyne, the only Tabernacle with unbroken activity from the early days. From this Tabernacle, in 1923, the Grand College of England was formed. Wairants have been issued for eighteen Tabernacles in addition to that of Royal Kent.

It was removed from the Statutes of the Great Priory of Scotland in 1933. Up to that tinie authority to confer it was contained in all Scottish Templar Charteis. “The degsee had been a scuice of worry for some years and had not been worked” for some sixty years. “There was some discussion and an examination of a ritual sup - plied by the Grand Conclave of the Holy Royal Arch Knight Templar Priests” was made at the time it was removed from the Statutes. “There was no protest when it was expunged” 0000 sAcEBD&iALis TEMPLi The Piiestly Order of the Temple (Ordo Sacerdotalis Tem - ph) was “introduced into America” on October 31, 1931, to quote fiom Volume I, Part 1, 1934, of the official “O.S.T. Re - ports “—page 3. The name in Latin, ORDO SACERDOTALIS TEMPLI, was devised by Knight Priest William Moseley Brown at the request of Knights Priests J. Raymond Shute, II, J. Edward Allen, and Luther T. Hartsell, Jr. It is, of course, the equivalent of the English, PRIESTLY ORDER OF THE TEMPLE. The name was used in order to take care of the thirty-thi ce Christian degi c’es 01 orders, to which claim was laid at or about the time that THE GREAT PRIORY OF AMERICA was about to be organized. Like many of the statements and “official” items connected with our present Knight Templar Priest Order in the United States, as I pointed out in my lengthy ALLOCUTION as Grand Preceptor in 1952, the statement “intioduced into Amer - ica” needs clarification. It should have read “thus was the Order reintroduced into America,” because there is evidence that these degrees, or degree of The Priestly Order, were con - ferred in this country for more than a hundred years before 1931. To prove this point I cite the following: There is a document dated 1829 in the archives of the Su - preme Council, 330 of the Noithern Jurisdiction. On the inside of the last page of what is otherwise a catechism of another Masonic order, is a notice of the Priestly Order. On the back of this page is a secoid of two meetings of The Order of High Priesthood; one in Providence, and the other in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, dated February 21 and February 25, 1829, re - spectively Elsewhere I have seen statements which aver that 7"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"there are instances of these two Orders being conferred at the Ma same meeting, although I have not seen aiiy documents to ass~ prove this It may be that in these two places in Rhode Island are such instances.

Thiiee of the stoiies have letters cii thern—”C,” “II” and “F.” I assume these mean CHARITY, HOPE aiid FAITH.

Knight Priest Brain gives some explanatioiis of the plate of symbolic designs in the Ritual, but iii two or three instances his interpretations are iiicoi’rect.

I understand this is unlike the 16 Ritual, piesesitly used in Eiigland, which is similar to that 19 used by us. 14 The other ritual in Knight Priest Brain’s pamphlet is dated 15 1839, but it is practically a verbatim copy of the 1813 ritual before me. 0 tli e There are at least two other Rituals of questionable viiitage, gi ec probably interim rituals betweeii 1814 aiid the present Eiighish Pi ic version.
