When we take a survey of nature, we view man, in his infancy more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attacks of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Cre - ator of heaven and earth to have made man independent; hut, as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of sod- ety, mankind w~re made dependent en each other for protection and security, as they tbereby enjoy better opportunities for fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that vuill so demean him- sell as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knovuledge and understanding may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless mem - her of sdciety, and unworthy of our protection as Masons.
