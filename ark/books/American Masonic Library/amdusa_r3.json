LECTURE The secrets of an Installed Sovereign Mast er originated in events which occurred after the completion of the Temple. Thes e I will narrate in accordance with our traditions, supplem ented by testim ony from the Volum e of Sacred Law. When, through the m ercy of the Soverei gn Grand Master of the Universe, the Tem ple at Jerusalem was co mpleted by the wisdom of King Solom on, assisted by the strength of Hiram King of Tyre, and the beautifying skill of Hiram Abiff, the Sovereigns of the neighboring countries sent their am bassadors bearing precious gifts to the King, congratulating him upon the com pletion of his great and holy work; but there was one, the Sovereign of a m ore distant country, the Queen of Sheba, who would not be content to se nd an em bassage, however splendid, but would go up to Jerusalem he rself, so that her eyes might see the magnificent Tem ple, and her ears m ight hear the wisdom of King Solom on, whose fam e had spread throughout the then known world. The circumstances of the following visit ar e given in the 10th Chapter of the First Book of Kings, which I com mend to your earnest perusal. On a set day, the Queen of Sheba, a ttended by her brilliant and num erous retinue, went to view the buildings of the Te mple. She was escorted by King Solom on, who, seeing his chief Master Mason A donirum , standing aside m odestly, and wishing to confer upon him the distingui shed honor of presenting him to the Queen, beckoned him thus; ( Gesture with left hand beckoning him to advance ) but Adonirum , either m isinterpreting th e gesture, or from a hum ility which often accom panies true genius, hesitated to a dvance; the King beckoned him again, and yet a third time . Adonirum thereupon approached th e Illustrious Sovereign and his distinguished guest, and, m aking this obeisance (right hand on heart and bow) would have knelt at his royal Master' s feet; but King Solom on, taking him by the hand, prevented him , and, raising him with the grip of a Most Excellent Master, said Rise, Giblum. (Giblum is a Hebrew word signifying Stone Squarer, or Perfect Mason.) 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"When the royal party was about to re tire, Adonirum saluted the King thus: ( Gesture with left hand beckoning to advance three times ) (Penal Sign , then right hand over heart and bow) in token of hum ility; hence is derived the Sign and Salute of an Installed Sovereign Master.

When he entered into the Ark he took with him his wife, his three sons and their wives, and two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life, as God had com manded him . His father Lanech having died a short tim e before at the age of 777 years, there were no other ancient Patriarchs at the tim e of the flood with the exception of Me thuselah, who attained the age of 969 years, and as no m ention is m ade in Holy Writ of his death, he is supposed to have perished in the flood. Enoch, the son of Jared the sixth in descent from Adam , who had been instructed in the history of Ma nkind since the Creation, and also in the Arts and Sciences as know at that tim e, perceiving that that knowledge was likely to be lost in the general destruction foretold by Adam , and being desirous of preserving that knowledge for future gene rations, m ade two pillars, one of brass and the other of brick, and wrote thereon in hieroglyphics a description thereof.
