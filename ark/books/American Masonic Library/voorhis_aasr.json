As we go back to the first actual recordings of the Craft, we come to a point where legend is paramount. These legends are interesting but they are not historical, for the true histoiy only begins where records are extant. Freemasonry is not unique in the respect to its beginning. If religions were stripped of legend, their mysterious appeal would suffer likewise. This work is not concerned with appeals. It purports to be a story of the formation and continuation of that system of Freemasonry known in the United States and some other countries as The Scottish Rite— and in others as the Ancient and Accepted Rite. Until the middle of this century practically nothing was known of any of the steps leading up to the formation in i8oi of the first Supreme Council before 1761, when a certain Stephen Morin was granted a Patent to confer some Ecossais or Scottish grades of Free - masoniy in the West Indies. Nothing tangible had been brought to light before that date and, unlike almost all other systems of Free - masonry, the Scottish Rite never claimed an antiquity beyond that of Mann’s Patent. For the sake of reference, let us look at some of the major claims of other Rites and Orders of the Craft: SYMBOLIC—Sixteenth century stone masons—aitho there are other wild claims back to the time of Prince Edwin of York, England. There are even some claims going back to Adam. CAPITULAR—Those having the Royal Arch are claimed to be the only Masters of the Craft, and that they existed as such many years before the Grand Lodge at London was formed in 1717. CRYPTIC—No one seems to have associated fanciful stories about this Rite other than that they are neglected portions of the Symbolic Grades. CHIVALRIC—Here we find fantastic claims going back to the time of the Crusades—not a single one of which has been proved. RED CROSS OF CONSTANTINE—There is not a shred of evidence to show that the Order, which was formed in i865 by William Went- 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE worth Little, in England, has anything to do with groups of similar names antedating it. ROSICRUCIAN—The above mentioned William Wentworth Little also claimed that the Masonic Rosicrucian Order was of ancient origin but without sustaining evidence. ROYAL ORDER OF SCOTLAND—The claims made by this group may have some basis but no records have been exhibited to prove the ancient vintage shown in the rituals, which are purported to have been re-written by Robert Burns. RITES OF MEMPHIS AND MISRAIM—The claims about these rites are extravagant, ridiculous and foolish. ANDROGYNOUS GROUPS—None of the claims for these groups going back beyond the last century are of any value. The Amaranth, for example, claims a formation in Sweden many years before Masonry even existed in that country. SHRINE—This earliest of the so-called “fun degrees” started after the middle of the last century. Claims that it came from Arabia and/or the East are fanciful. Needless to say no historical evidence has been F forthcoming to prove them. SCOTTISH RITE—This Rite claims to have been formed in Charles - ton, South Carolina, U.S.A. in i8oi, dating its ancestry back to 1762 —and that it was a self-constituted body—a Supreme Councll of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. This can and has been proved to be substantially so. The purpose of the above rehearsal of claims is to show that, although all other rites of Masonry have no historical proof of their pronounciamentos, the Scottish RIte, without legends of any kind, not only holds interest among Freemasons but is actually growing faster than those which have legends. A few statistics will tell the Story: Year Royal Arch Knight Templar Scottig1~ Rite % of MM. 1170 114.000 30,000 3,400 027 1390 157,000 84,000 17,000 2.6 1910 336,000 200,000 109,000 7.8 1910 373.000 425,000 540.000 16.6 1950 659,000 342,000 723,000 19.8 1960 701,000 396.000 954,000 21.1 In 1960, 17% of the Master Masons were Royal Arch Masons; ~o% were Knlghts Templar; and 23% Scottish Rite Masons. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE There are many reasons why Scottish Rite Masonry is growing as other Rites are declining but they will not be discussed here. All these rites have something to sell more than mere claims of origin or they would have died out completely, as did many other rites in the past. This picture is shown only because it proves that fanciful theories of origin do not constitute a sound basis for popularity. True. there are some rather mysterious matters connected with the Scottish Rite such as its name, where the degrees came from and why it flourishes as an hierarchy in a democratic country, etc. These matters are not germane here, as at least the first two are found in other rites of Freemasonry. The purpose here is to give what may be termed the “Story of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry” as I see it, in the light of results of inquiry into its history during the last few years. There is a dearth of material available for the Scottish Rite Mason to learn about his organization. There are three or four out-of-print, long and intricate histories for the student, plus some short articles on various phases of its history. Much of this material is replete with inaccuracies, to say the very least. In this presentation I am conscious of the fact that I will mention few references or sources of my in - formation. This is not a work for scholars. It is for the “Layman” of the Scottish Rite. All that I can say is that my data are from works of reliable Masonic historians and the results of researches by the handful of Masonic scholars working on the subject, including James Fairbairn Smith, 330; Dr. V,Jilliam L. Cummings, 330; the late Ray Baker Harris, 330, and the late Charles Henry Copestake, 330 In some lnstanceS my conclusions may be optional, but they are what I consider the most probable with the information at hand. I hope this effort on my part will give a general picture of the formation of the Scottish Rite and will fill the void which I think exists in the litera - ture of the Rite. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE PART I ECOSSAIS MASONRY “Ecossais” means Scotch or Scottish. As the name of the Rite of Freemasonry herein treated is terrued “Scottish Rite,” a few obser - vations are apropos in advance of setting down the historical facts. Let us first clear out of the picture a certain so-called theory which is advanced as fact by secular as well as many Masonic writers of the past. It is a subject which is not worthy of serious considera - tion here, as at least three reputable Masonic historians have “put down” all claims made by proponents of the alleged Stuart inter - ventions and dreams shaped in support of such claims. I am refer - ring to what has been labelled “Jacoblte Freernasonxy.” Those not versed in British history should know that Jacobite is a term loosely applied to followers of James II of England, who was also James VII of Scotland, and the Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, his grandson. Following thorough but independent investigations of the subject the three historians, referred to above, summarize their results as follows: GEORGE W. SPETH: “Put no trust whatever in accoua~s connect - ing the Stuarts with Freemasonry.” WILLIAM J. HUGHAN: “All statements respecting P~~c Charles Edward [Stuart] and his relations with the Order Fo~ Feeonasonry] are apocryphal and some of them most absurd.” ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: “Toward the end of his life Prince Charles Edward [Stuart] denied that he had ever been made a Mason, and according to Mr. D. Murray Lyon [another reputable Scottish Masonic historian] there is no evidence from any Scottish source that he was. The Jacobite cabinet of forgery was in France, and no - where else.” Our reference here precludes even a digest of the material cover - ing the French inventions, but it is noted because, nowhere has it ever been explained why the rite which came out of France during the Pretender’s residence there, ultimately was called “Scottish.” It is, without any foundation of fact, said to have been authorized ftom Kill— winning in Scotland—a sort of “glorified” Kilwinning Scottish tradition. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE It is not to be expected that this treatment will give a positive answer to exactly when our Rite started. However, with the evidence at hand, some of the steps leading up to the formal existence of a Supreme Council of the Rite will be recited. It must be held, at the outset, that it was rather soon after Operative Masonry had given way (for all intents and purpose) to a Speculative Craft early in the 1 8th century, that innovations, more properly called additions, to the, by this time established, Hiramic Legend were propagated in Lodges, first in France and then in Germany, and to a lesser extent in other countries. On April 27, 1732, Loge L’Anglaise, No. 363 (Modern) came into being in Bordeaux, France with an Irishman, Captain Martin Kelly as Master. In six days he “raised” four candidates one of whom be- came the third Master of the Lodge only nine days later. On May 2nd a Nicholas Stainton became Master. In the four days which followed, two candidates became Master Masons. Then, on May 6th, James Bradshaw one of the candidates made during the first six days the Lodge existed, became Master. As we will part from this Lodge quite quickly, let us say here that it still exists—232 years of age (1964)— and that its minutes for the first eleven years are written in English. This Lodge acted as a “Mother Lodge” for many years—a custom prevalent in those days—one of its offspring being Loge La Francoise, which in turn gave rise to another Lodge, Parfaite Harmonie (Perfect Harmony) sometime between 1740 and 1744. It appears that the latter Lodge was formed for the purpose of devoting itself to conferring Ecossais Degrees, and probably was the first lodge founded for that purpose. At least it antedates all other Ecossais bodies now known or referred to in a mass of contemporary documents extant. It existed four years before similar bodies were formed in Toulouse and seven years previous to those formed in Marseille. Let it be especially noted that one Stephen Morn presided over Loge Parfait Harmonie in 1744, if not in other years. It should also be noted that this Lodge was active at least two years before the date of the spurious, legendary or forged document claiming to have established Arras Chapter of Rose Croix on February i ~, 1747, by Charles Edward Stuart, previously mentioned. The lodge established daughter lodges in Paris (the earliest known was —11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE in 1747); San Domingo, W.I.; Pengueux, France; and New Orleans, Louisiana, in the Colonies (1763). In 1756, a body called Knights of the East, Princes and Sovereigns of Masonry, was established in Paris and two years later a sort of rival group, actually founded in i75~, was revived. The latter was the Chap - ter of Clermont, founded by one Chevalier de Bonneville. Some of the brethren were members of both groups and it seems certain that they imposed their influence upon the Grand Lodge of France. Schisms developed between the two groups, and their influence waned. Then, in 1767, the government put a stop to the bickering—it ordered a ban on all Freemasonry in France. The lineage of the Ecossais Degrees is non-existant and, in spite of searches by Masonic historians for more than a hundred years, we know little more today than we knew when the search started. Who compiled any of the degrees—that is, those used today in our Rite— is unknown. This is a situation which exists in most of the Rites of Freemasonry. There are a number of large ritual collections in Masonic libraries and in private hands. It is obvious that hundreds were writ - ten. Some were published but many exist only in manuscript form. In a number of instances we know of names of degrees but no rituals of them are extant. Not many have come down to us as “working de - grees.” How some of them came to what is now known as the Rite of Perfection of twenty-five degrees is a problem not likely to be solved. It seems clear that some one or some group of men selected such degrees as they desired and formed them into a rather loose degree system—at first fourteen and later twenty-five. It appears, also, that most of these degrees were “uncontrolled” and thus more or less avail - able. Actually we are certain that a few years prior to the 1767 ban against Freemasonry by the government in France, there was formed some sort of an organization in Bordeaux. Furthermore, that this or - ganization controlled Ecossais degrees not controlled or recognized by the Grand Lodge of France having headquarters in Paris. At the same time another such group had been formed in Paris which was not recognized by the Grand Lodge. These two groups either worked to - gether or were actually one. They issued documents from “B 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE which, even during the early years, were referred to as having been is - sued at Berlin when it was really Bordeaux. Research has failed to turn up a single authentic reference to any body of Masonry in Germany which could have or did issue such documents. It was simply a Sub - lime Council of Prince Masons with headquarters in Bordeaux and Paris. THE INSPECTORS Until 1950 our knowledge of the gestation of the Scottish Rite started with copies of a Patent issued by this Council of Sublime Princes to a certain Stephen Morin on August 27, 1761. There are ten signers of the patent but the signers are not identified as belong - ing to the Grand Lodge of France, nor are their Lodges found in the Grand Lodge list. The reason we now know, for they were not mem - bers of the Grand Lodge but in lodges of the “Sovereign Grand Coun - cil.” The document, among other things, commissioned Stephen Morn as “our Grand Inspector.” For years it was taken for granted that Morin was the first to bear the title of Inspector. Now we have come upon many original documents which show that there were at least two others before him—Lamoliere de Feuillard was appointed a Deputy Inspector in France July 24, 1752, and he appointed, evidently, one Bertrand Barthomieu, a Deputy for the West Indies in 1753. It ap - pears that the efforts of Morin and de Fenillard conflicted in the West Indies and Morn, who must have been a Deputy about the same time, seems to have decided to clear this matter up. He reappeared in Bordeaux in 17 6 i, explained the trouble and the Sovereign Grand Coun - cii gave him the patent as “GRAND INSPECTOR.” These three and Masse de Roussillon, who was appointed a Deputy Inspector in New Orleans, Louisiana, are the only ones actually appointed by the body in France. These Inspectors had the right to appoint Deputy Inspec - tors and their appointees had the same privilege. Altogether I have found 8o Inspectors of various titles. Of these it is known who ap - pointed 62 of them. (See Appendix). The dates run from 1750 to 1810, when the Rite of Perfection, as such, was no longer an entity. There are some writers who have tried to negate Morn’s authority by declaring that the Grand Lodge of France annulled Morn’s Patent 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE on August 17, 1766. Copies of a document purported to have been issued to that end do not carry a single signature found on Copies of the Morin Patent—for a good reason—the Grand Lodge of France did not issue the Patent to Morn. May I add that, not having issued it, they had no authority to annul it. A certain “Worshipful Brother Martin”, according to the copy of the purported document, was ap - pointed in Morin’s stead. Said “Worshipful Brother Martin” has never been identified, nor has any record of such an appointment been located in the printed Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of France. It might be further mentioned that the Grand Lodge of France never had any authority over Ecossais Lodges in the first or the last place. It seems likely that the Rite of Perfection was composed of four - teen degrees by 1751 and dealt with matters concerning Solomon’s Temple. The second portion of eleven additional degrees dealt with the Second Temple of Zerubbabel plus a third Mystical Temple of Christ. These eleven were added post 1751, starting with Knight of the East or Sword and ending with Knight Kadosh (Knight of the Black and ‘White Eagle) as the 2 4 th, and Prince of the Royal Secret as the 2 5 th. In 1762 a Sovereign Grand Council of the 2 5 th Degree was set up and beside a Grand Secretary, two subordinate Secretaries (one for Paris and Bordeaux, and one for the Provinces) were provided. We find this in the CONSTITUTIONS of 1762. compiled by nine Coin - missiaries in Bordeaux who issued the Morin Patent. Little is known of the life and movements of Stephen Morn. He is believed to have been a wine merchant. We know that he was a Christian because the Lodge of which he was a member only ad - mitted Christians and would only allow visitors who were. When Morin left France for the West Indies with his newly acquired Patent, but without a copy of the CONSTITUTIONS which had not yet been prepared and which were to be sent to him later, his ship was captured by the British and he was taken to England as a civilian prisoner. He was not confined, however, for we have evidence that he called upon Lord Ferrers, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England (Moderns) and he, says Morin, indorsed his patent, recog - niZing him as the only person responsible for the ~~Lodge Degrees” of the Rite of Perfection in the Western Hemisphere. He appears to have 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE been in Scotland for at least three months in 1762. Thus, we can sur - mise, from the latitude allowed him, that, altho he was a civilian prisoner, he was a person of considerable stature and trusted by the English authorities. If this were not so, It iS difficult to account for his being left to his own designs without much supervision of any kind. Morin at last arrived in Jacmel, San Domingo in 1763, where he took up residence with the Parish Priest. The CONSTITUTIONS promised him before he left Bordeaux were awaiting him. His first act was to appoint a Senior Deputy Inspector General in the person of Henry Andrew Francken, a naturalized customs official of Dutch nativ - ity, in Kingston, Jamaica. As reference has been made to various Inspectors and will be again, it might be well to note here that Morin, himself, appointed only five in addition to Francken (Desehamps in 176 3 —Brest, France; Bern - doague in 1764—San Domingo, W.I.; Lamarque in 1764—San Domin - go, W. I.; Adams in 177o—Kingston, Jamaica; and DeBoissy in 1770— also in San Domingo, W.I.) However, 52 Inspectors descended from Franeken, he directly appointing six (Hayes—1768; Van Rensselaer— 1768; Stringer—1768; Prevost—1774; Yates—1 77~ and Small—1783). In 1770, under William Winter (Provincial Grand Master of Jamaica of the Grand Lodge of England—Moderns) a Grand Chapter of the 2 4 th degree was set up in Kingston. From 1748 to 1757 Ecossais Lodges were erected through Bor - deaux in the West Indies, but following Monn’s arrival in 1763, he started setting up bodies. The first of these was Perfect Harmony in Port-au-Prince, San Domingo, in 1764. In 1767, Franeken authorized a Lodge of Perfection (of 14 degrees) in Albany, New York, and other bodies came into existence through 1790. The next step in the gestation of the Scottish Rite concerns a man about whom little is known and whose activities in Masonry before the second quarter of the i 9 th century are equally unknown. However, because of his appearance in New York in 1832 and his con - nections with a Masonic group known as the Cernean Rite, he is im - portant in our picture. It is he who may have presented the spark or germ which started the movement which culminated in the formation of the Supreme Council in Charleston, South Carolina in i8oi. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE ST. LAURENT The name of this man is most impressive: Marie Antoine Nicolas Alexandre Robert de Jachin de Sante Rose de Roume de St. Laurent, Marquis de Sante Rose, Comte de St. Laurent. He was a former cap - tain of a ship and Commander of a Flotilla of the Mexican Navy. This man, about who we know few details, claimed, in 1832, to be Sovereign Grand Commander of a Supreme Council, then and still unknown, which had the equally impressive title of “The Supreme Council for New Spain, and Mexico, Terra Firma, Southern America and from the one sea to the other, the Canary Islands, etc. etc.” To show the extent of this territory, New Spain and Mexico included Mexico and the present states of Washington, Montana, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Terra Firma covered the northern coastline of South America. South - ern America consisted of Florida and West florida to the Mississippi River. The Canary Islands seem to have been tossed in for good measure. St. Laurent it appears, according to his “Golden Book” in the archives of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, written in English, French, Spanish and Latin, was born “at Santa Lucia de Santa f~ near Bogota on the twenty-first of January, 1774.” Just where this place is has not been established. He appeared in New York in 1832 and sug - gested an amalgamation of his homeless Supreme Council with what we now term the Cerneau Rite of Perfection. This body was then in the process of trying to put itself on a par with the two Supreme Coun - cils, 330 by claiming its 2 5 th degree as equivalent to the 3 2nd degree of these two Supreme Councils. St. Laurent offered them the only known copy of the Grand Constitutions of 1786. They accepted his proposition and the combined bodies became known as “The United Supreme Council for the Western Hemisphere.” The document must have been a copy of some kind and although St. Laurent claims to have deposited it in the archives of the newly amalgamated Supreme Council, it will probably remain a mystery because of a fire, which suspiciously occurred a few months before that Supreme Council be - came extinct, supposedly destroyed all of their records. Shortly after the amalgamation, St. Laurent went to Paris, where"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE in 1834, a Treaty of Alliance between the Supreme Councils of France, Brazil, Belgium and The United Supreme Council for the Western Hemisphere was concluded. In June of that year St. Laurent wrote the Belgium Supreme Council that he had a copy of the Grand Con - stitutions, signed by an Illustrious Brother Wowelner and Illustrious • Brother Bernardo de Galvez, fomer Viceroy of Mexico, and other Grand Commanders since P7%. If this statement is true, it is possible that he gave a copy to de Grasse-Tilly, who will be discussed next, in San Domingo, before that latter went to Charleston. This would account for de Grasse setting up a paper Supreme Council for the West Indies in 1796. To surmise still further, if de Grasse had a copy and used it to help form our Supreme Council in i8or, and had given them a copy, then it was lost with other records in a fire in Charleston which de - stroyed about all of the old records of the Supreme Council. There seems little doubt that there was a copy of the “1786 Constitutions” in Charleston in i8oi at the formation of the Supreme Council because • (1) there is a copy in French “translated from the English” by Dela - hogue at Charleston, not later than 1802, now in the archives of the Grand Lodge of the Netherlands, and (2) there is a copy in English in the handwriting of Dr. Dalcho in the archives of the Supreme Council 33~’, Northern Jurisdiction. Be that as it may, the first public exhibit of these so-called Grand Constitutions of 1786, appeared in France, by way of St. Laurent, in 1832 in French and 1834 in Latin. No Supreme Council up to that time having printed copies. DE GRASSE AND DELAHOGUE We have records of fifty Inspectors of the Rite of Perfection ap - pointed before i 8 oo. There are also some others whose dates of ap - pointment have not been established, but it would increase the num - her substantially. Naturally with so many “top men” active in propagating the Rite many things could have happened, and they did. These things took place in and about San Domingo, Jamaica, Charleston, South Carolina and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. • Ignoring several individuals who were active in one way or an - other in the Rite let us examine, so far as extant records will allow, 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE two key men involved in situation just pnor to the formation of the Charleston Council, 330 in South Carolina. The first is Count Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse-Tilly (born at Versailles, France on February 14, 1765 and died in Paris on June 10, 1845) made a Mason in Contrat Social Ecossais Lodge in Paris. The second is Jean Baptiste Noel Marie Delahogue, his father- in-law, (born in 17~ in Paris and died there on April 13, 1822), whose Masonic initiation place and date is unknown. De Grasse, son of the French Admiral of similar name, came to San Domingo in 1789 to run sugar plantations left to him by his father who died the previous year. He became acquainted with Dela - hogue shortly after his arrival, probably at Masonic functions, for they were both active Masonically. We shall not rehearse De Grasse’s ro - mantic experiences here beyond the fact that he married Delahogue’s daughter. San Domingo about this time was being plagued by “slave upris- ings” and in 1793 they became so acute that most of the whites sought refuge elsewhere. Among them were DeGras~e and Delahogue, who, with their families, went to Charleston, South Carolina, arriving on August 14, 1793. They stayed in the United States off and on until 1804. De Grasse was back in San Domingo in 1799 where he was cap- tured by the slaves and, at the insistence of the American Council was released as an American citizen, having been naturalized in Charleston June 17, 1799. Of the known activities of these two brethren, some matters are still unexplained. Among them is that both had a 3 2nd degree before arriving at Charleston and had signed documents since 1793 as Deputy Inspectors General of the twenty-five Degree Rite of Perfection. Yet no record has come to light as to who appointed them before 1796. If they were such we are at loss to explain why, on December 12, 1796, Hyman Isaac Long, a Deputy Inspector General of the Rite of Per - fection and its titular head in Jamaica, appointed de Grasse and five others—also French refugees—Deputy Inspectors and empowered Dela - hogue, made a Deputy Inspector General a month earlier, to organize a Lodge of High Secrets of the 2 5 th degree, in Charleston. A Grand or Sublime Council was actually organized by him on January 13, 1797. i8"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE It is also known that De Grasse issued some patents in the 33 rd degree to Delahogue and others on this same November 12, 1796. Previously, in 1795, De Grasse, with his father-in-law, Delahogue, founded Loge La Candeur at Charleston, composed exclusively of French Roman Catholics. He was Master in 1798. On August 4, 1799 De Grasse demitted and six days later founded Loge La Reunion at Charleston. During his stay in Charleston, De Grasse helped his father-in-law run a school, specializing in the principles of Fortification, Artillery and Fencing. On February 21, 1802 De Grasse became Grand Commander and Delahogue Lt. Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the French West Indies. In March, 1802, he returned again to San Domingo under General Lecleric and upon capitulation he was • made a prisoner and taken to Jamaica where he was allowed consider- able freedom. Released in i 804, he went immediately to Bordeaux, France, where he arrived on July 4 th. On September of that year he • established the Supreme Council of France. Having lost all his pc.sses - sions in San Domingo he was forced to resume a military career to sup - port his family. This ended in his being taken a prisoner in Italy from whence he was transferred to England. After his release in 1814 he returned to France. During these years Delahogue headed the Masonic bodies De Grasse had established. In the mean time he established the Supreme Councils of Italy, in Milan—March ~, i8o~; Spain, in Madrid—October 1809; and Belgium, in Brussells, on May ii, 1817, after his return. To pick up Delahogue again, he had been issued a Patent as Deputy Grand Inspector General of the Rite of Perfection on Novem - ber 12, 1796, a month before that issued to De Crasse. He was first Master of Loge La Candeur which he and De Grasse founded. He was naturalized in New Orleans as an American citizen on August 6, 1804, stating that he had lived there upwards of eighteen months pre - viously. He affiliated with Loge La Charite, under the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, on May 27, 1804 and on July 2 9 th of the same year the Supreme Council at Charleston issued him a patent to establish “bodies under its authority.” As soon as word got to him that De Grasse had been released as a prisoner in Jamaica in the summer of 1804, he returned to France. When De Grasse became the Grand"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE Commander of the Supreme Council of France, Delahogue assumed a similar office in the Supreme Council of the West Indies, we might say, in exile. The reason I have dwelt on these two French-Americans so long is that they have now been recognizect as participants, with the nine others who established, in Charleston, South Carolina, the first Supreme Council of the 33 rd Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Rite (now known as the Scottish Rite) in the world. These nine were John Mitchell, Frederick Dalcho, Thomas B. Bowen, Abraham Alexander, Emanuel de Ia Motta, Isaac Auld, Israel de Lieben, Moses C. Levy and James Moultrie. There were two Irishmen, two Englishmen a Czech, a Pole, a Danish West Indian, and two Americans, plus these two Frenchmen—De Grasse and Delahogue. All except the last two died in or near Charleston, South Carolina. Five were Protestaiits, two Roman Catholics and four Jews. No one has been able to determine where three of the founders, Mitchell, DeGrasse or Delahogue came into possession of the 33 rd degree, the latter two having signed documents with this degree four years prior to the formation of the Supreme Council. One thing seems clear—DeGrasse and Delahogue appear as the only ones who could have instigated the organization of the Supreme Council. It must be brought to mind that the thirty-third degree was not then and is not now a “working” degree, as such. It is an investiture cere - mony. I have seen the degree worked in two jurisdictions and copies of the degree worked here and elsewhere—they vary greatly. In the beginning it was probably nothing more than a title without any cere - mony whatever. It was probably more in line with the Deputy or Grand Inspectors General of the Rite of Perfection—no ritual or any reference to one of this grade being known. These eleven Masons met in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1801 and fomed a Rite of Freemasonry and stated that the Constitutions of 1762 and the Grand Constitutions of 1786 were the basis of the Rite. Regardless of who wrote them or who concocted the thirty - third degree, and the others which make up the system, these Con - stitutions form the basis of our law and the degrees of our ritualistic system, but no one after years of investigation, has been able to prove who wrote any of the degrees or the constitutions. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE PART II THE CONSTITUTIONS — 1761, 1762 and 1786 There are three sets of Constitutions about which Masonic his - torians have expressed contrary views ever since they became the ob - jects of critical examination. Masonic scholars of repute, Daicho, Pike, Gourgas, Carson, Lobinger, Baynard, Lindsay, and members of the History Committee (1950-1955) of the Northern Jurisdiction Supreme Council, have expressed views. These views run from declaring them as authentic, including the belief that they were compiled in Berlin by Frederick the Great, to statements branding them forgeries. I hesitate to enter into a controversy about them, but as they are used as the basic law of the Scottish Rite, I have no alternative. It is not that I fear contradiction or being used as a target by persons whose views are not like mine, but because most of those who are so vocifer - ous appear to have little more information than some statements made by others to back their beliefs. Most of these statements are undocu - mented opinions and often made years ago before any real research was made on the Constitutions. I have ventured in such nebulous fields before and have been pushed to the “river’s edge” more than once, and have survived numerous jostlings without permanent scars—so one more excursion will not make or break me, historically. Many excursions into the authenticity of all three of these Con - stitutions have been launched. Albert Pike, Robert B. Folger, Baynard, Lindsay, among others, have devoted many pages in their “analyses” of the subject. In most cases flaws in their reasoning as well as histori - cal inaceuracies are found. No attempt will be made here to review these treatments. However, to show some of the inconsistencies and unsettled situations left to be solved, a few will be mentioned. It must be brought to mind that in i8oi, it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt that copies of at least two, if not all three, of the Constitutions were held by the Founders. As previously mentioned, Delahogue’s copy and Dalcho’s copy of the 1786 Constitutions and the copies made by Gourgas (1762—June 7’ 1809 and 1761—August ~, 1813 and 1786— no date). There seems little, if any, use arguing that the Charleston 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE Supreme Council had NO copies of a Constitution. The evidence is all against such an assumption. As to who wrote them, who signed them, where they were written —the subject is academic. In that light, and examination of some curi - ous things about them is exhibited. Let us look first at the so-called GRAND SECRET CONSTI - TUTIONS, or “Regulations of the Sovereigns Grand Inspectors Gen - eral of the 33 rd Grand Commanders ad vitam, of ancient and modern Free and Royal Masonry over the two Hemispheres, Constituted at Paris, York and Berlin.” They consist of thirty-three articles (copied by J. J. J. Gourgas—Aug. ~, i8i~). The 9 th states that “the present Secret Constitutions emanated from the Grand East of Paris, York, and Berlin; and from our well beloved and Illustrious Brother Frederick of Prussia the 2nd, Grand Master, Sovereign Commander in Chief, of the Army of the Sovereign Princes and Knights,” etc. The 1 3 th says “The Sns Gd Irs Gal Grand Commanders are cre - ated by the Sovereign Senfite, who nominates NINE Commissaries,” etc. The zznd makes some statements regarding the source from which the ceremonies and mysteries are derived, to wit: “The Assideans, and Hebrew Sect . . . predecessors and Fathers of the Essenians and of the Pharisians.” The 3 ist states that the “Grand Commanders of the Holy Empire, are the Depositaries and Preservers of the Grand Secret Constitutions, which are the Degrees of the 33 rd which exist since the World is the World.” The first thing that comes to mind is that no where has a single piece of paper come to light confirming the formation or existence of any such group in Paris, York or Berlin. We do know that nine Corn - missiaries compiled a Constitution in BORDEAUX, France the very day that Morn was given his Patent—August 27, i 7 6i—which is the date of the 1761 Constitutions. We know this because they agreed to send Morn a copy, which they did. This copy was the expanded Constitution of 1762, which mentions the Constitutions of 1761. The next thing which comes to mind is the mention of Frederick the Great. Much has been argued about him not being able to sign the 1786 Constitutions. I am not too concerned with that. I am con - cerned that he didn’t sign the Constitutions of 1761. 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE Frederick II, surnamed the Great, was born January iz, 1712. At his own request he was initiated into Masonry at a special Lodge held for that express purpose at Brunswick on August 14 and 15, 1738. He created the Lodge of the Three Globes and proclaimed it to be a Grand Lodge. During the first year of his reign he founded a pri - vate Lodge, made up of twenty-seven of his close associates and was its Worshipful Master. In 1746 a happening in this Lodge resulted in his withdrawing any further “working” interest in Masonry, accord - ing to a story variously printed in numerous periodicals. (See Moore’s Freemasons’ Magazine, Vol. 7, pages 237-241, captioned as sent to the magazine by “Y” from Schenectady, N. Y.—April 1848 and translated from a German “Work of authority entitled ‘Erwinia’.”) General Wallrave, a learned engineer, and member of Frederick’s Lodge. was intrusted with rebuilding the fortress of Neisle. He trans - mitted information about the plans of fortification and mine fields to Prince de Kaunitz, at Vienna, for a price. One of his letters to Prince de Kaunitz was intercepted and taken to Frederick, who immediately called a meeting of the Lodge. Frederick stated he knew that one of the trusted members of the Lodge had violated his Masonic oath and that of a State official. He offered to forget the matter if the guilty Brother would confess. After three appeals without any Brother coming forward, he closed the Lodge “for the last time.” After the meet - ing, as the Brethren were retiring, General Wallrave was arrested and conducted to Magdebourg where he was confined for seven years in a single, one window cell. He was then removed to a more comfortable prison where he had more light and could exercise a bit. He remained in this prison until his death in 1776. The trouble about this story is that it does not exactly conform with historical recordings In a HIS - TORY OF FREDERICK ThE SECOND. CALLED FREDERICK THE GREAT, by Thomas Carlyle, considered the most reliable and trustworthy of all books written about him (seven volumes i866), we find that six Brethren of the Hamburg Lodge (four of whom are named) made Frederick, along with a Captain Wartensleben, a Mason on Tuesday, August 14-15, 1738 (starting just before midnight on the i 4 th). It took place in Korn’s Hotel in Brunswick when Frederick was the Crown-Prince. Carlyle states in Volume II, page 498, that “The Crown-Prince prosecuted his Masonry at Reinsberg or elsewhere 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE occasionally for a year or two, but was never ardent at it, and very soon after his Accession left it altogether. A Royal Lodge was established at Berlin, of which the new King consented to be Patron; but he never once entered the place, and only his Portrait presided over the myster - ies at that Establishment.” This precludes Frederick from being Mas - ter of the Lodge and the story looks fictional. General Wallrave was a Dutch Officer, strong-headed and strong- built, with beastly immoral habits. He delighted in showing off his silver and gold plate which was engraved with a flying raven (wall - raven). His bedroom contained three beds for himself, his wife and his mistress, the wife of one of his quartermasters. The mistress was his downfall for it was she who divulged the information that the Gen - eral was leaking secrets of the fortifications at Neisle in Silicia. This double-dealing with the Austrian Chancellor, Wenzel Anton Kaunitz - f Rielburg (1711-1794) caused his arrest at Potsdam on February 12, 1748, and where he remained until he died on January i6, 1773 (according to Militair-Lexikon, Vol. IV, pages 150-151). This event so affected Frederick that he never again was active in Masonry. I-low his name came into a Masonic document fifteen years after he ceased any activity in Masonry, which came into being in France, and never in York, Paris or Berlin, can only be surmised Our conclusion is not that the Secret Constitutions were forged, as they are mentioned in the 1762 Constitutions, but that the place of their compilation was Bordeaux, France, and that they had nothing whatever to do with Frederick the Great, his name being used for “status” Furthermore, I suggest that whoever made the copies which have come to light added the title “ 33 rd” in the various places it is used after 0.1.0. and D.G.I.G., and did so at least thirty-four years after their original compilation. For this suggestion, I offer the copies of the 1762 Constitutions as evidence, where not once is 3 3 rd mentioned. Now we come to the 1762 Constitutions made by the Nine Corn - misaries in Bordeaux, France—altho they state “at the Grand East of Berlin.” They are dated October 25, 1762 (“6th day of the 3 rd week of the 7 th moon of the Hebrew Aera 5562, or of the Christian Aera 1762”) while Frederick the Great was on the battlefield of Freiburg (the battle being won on October 29, 1762, four days AFTER the 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE date of the Constitutions). They consist of thirty-five articles, with a foreword which says “that besides the ancient and Secret Constitutions of the August order on the Sublime Princes, which will for ever be entirely observed.” Article two lists the degrees—25 of them. Article eleven provides for the “Nine Commissaries.” As above stated no men - tion is made of any degree beyond the 25th—Prince of the Royal Secret-~-in these Constitutions. Our opinion, up to this point, is that the Secret Constitutions of 1761 were made in Bordeaux, France On the same day that Morn was given his Patent in a draft form and that they promised Morn to send him a copy when it was gone over and put in good order. They worked on it and came up with only two more articles than the year before. • They made copies and sent one to Morn, in San Domingo. It is even questionable if the 1761 Constitutions were ever really issued, but if so, then someone tampered with them later. These 1762 Constitutions, • to my mind, are THE Constitutions. The 1786 ones will be taken up next. These so-called Constitutions of 1786 present an enigma. They, too, are purported to have been compiled at Berlin with Frederick the Great present, on May i, 1786. Frederick died August 17, 1786 a hun - dred and eight days after the date of the Constitutions, after suffering from the gout among other ailments. We are not inclined to go very far into the controversy about these 1786 Constitutions for several rea - sons. Those who have done so previously wind up attacking those who have expressed opinions. In the first place, it has been shown that Frederick ceased any activity in Masonry in 1746. He was an aged man—74 years old—and in such bad health that, according to some of his biographers, he was confined to his quarters for the last year of his life. Next we find that the Constitutions are “for the Government of the Supreme Council of Inspectors General of the 3 3rd.~. Degree.” What Supreme Council? No one has ever heard of any body with such a name in 1786 or some ten years later. There were eighteen articles—just a skeleton of the 1762 ones. The First article stated that “The Constitutions and Regu - • lations made by the Nine Commissaries by the Grand Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret, in the year A 0 Lucis 5762, shall 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE be strictly adhered to & executed.” The Fifth article says “Each Supreme Council is to be composed of Nine Inspectors General There shall be but one Council of this degree in each Nation or King - dom of Europe, T~\\VO in the United States of America as remote from each other as possible. One in the British West Indies, and one in the French West India Islands.” The double limitation in “The United States of America” in a document in 1786 is fantastic, to say the very least about the designation. While the Colonies declared their inde - dependence on January i8, 1777, they did not become “The United States of America” until September 17, 1787, when a Convention of delegates from twelve of the thirteen Colonies finished their work. Actually “The United States of America” came into being on June 21, 1788, when the ninth Colony (by then called a State), New Hamp - shire, ratified the Constitution. While John Mitchell’s acknowledgment of the “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” is dated May 26, 1778, it does seem amaz - ing that it was necessary to provide, in France, for two Supreme Coun - cils in a sparsely populated area overseas. To further mention a matter, among many others, which is in - consistent if not downright at variance with known facts, no record has come to light of the existence of a Supreme Council in Berlin, Paris, or anywhere else in 1786—nor of a Patent or other document showing that a 330 was conferred on any individual at the time of the supposed date of the 1786 Constitutions. Not only that but there are no signatures on any copies of the 1786 Constitutions. Many have said that they were fabricated at Charleston, but by whom no one suggests. It seems plausible that Delahogue and/or De Grasse could have very well have had a copy of the 1762 Constitutions, possibly by way of St. Laurent. They could very well have produced the so-called Grand Constitutions. If so, that would explain why we find no signatures on the extant copies. Possibly St. Laurent was the culprit as it was he who made them known in 1832, as will be shown subsequently. In any event my conclusion is that the so-called 1786 Constitutions were NOT compiled in Berlin, that some of their contents are incongruous, that no such body for which these Constitutions regulate was in exist - ence in 1786, and that no such thing as a 33 rd degree was known then 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE and that Frederick the Great was NOT present at the alleged meeting and did not sign them. Further, that there is no record of any of the individuals who are supposed to have compiled them—as no signatures are attached and that no Masonic archives have come to light men - tioning anyone who did. Likewise, if they were fabricated, no hint, based on names of the culprits, has come to light. Of course, this is to be expected if they were fabricated. Now, to reiterate: These unanswered queries have nothing to do with the Scottish Rite, as of today, which is primarily based on the 1762-1786 Constitutions. There is nothing unusual about taking exist - ing constitutions of a similar body or group and using them to base the laws of a newly organized body upon. Have not religious groups done likewise (the laws of Moses, for instance), taking them from a book (the Bible) which has no proof of authorship, no signatures and no originals. The newly-created Charleston Supreme Council, 330 simply adopted, with minor changes, these Constitutions and all suc - ceeding recognized Supreme Councils have done likewise.

It was signed by the members of the Committee—Fredenck Dalcho, 330 Lt. Grand Commander; Isaac Auld, 330 Sovereign Grand Inspector General; Emmanuel de la Motta, 330 Treasurer-General, and attested by John Mitchell 330, Grand Commander and Abraham Alexander, 330, Secretary General, of the “G. Empire,” Grand and Supreme Council. Among many other statements in the document we find that “On the 3 ist of May, ~8oi (i8oi), the Supreme Council of the 33 d degree for the United States of America was opened with the high honors of Masonry, by Brothers John Mitchell and Frederick Dalcho, Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, and in the course of the present year, the whole number of Grand Inspectors General was corn- pleated, agreeably to the Grand Constitutions.” On January i, 1803 an accompanying “Circular” signed by John Mitchell was issued—so that the two circulars were sent together to various presiding Grand Officers and others in this and probably other countries. The second circular was a plea for union of Masonic in - terests, preferably under a single head. The December ~j, 1802 circular (an original copy being extant) definitely establishes the date May 3’, i8oi (a Sunday, incidently) when the first (mother) Supreme Council of the Thirty-third Degree of the Scottish Rite was established. It is definitely known that several individuals had a Thirty-third Degree prior to the establishment of this Supreme Council, but not in a single instance have we discovered the source of their elevation. Thus, all that can be said, as a summary of the situation, is that at least four of those who had the degree formed a Supreme Council—the first body of its kind in the world. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE As indicated in the Circular, by the end of 18o~2, the “whole num - ber” was completed—nine. Actually Delahogue and De Grasse appear to have aided in the formation and were what we might call “super - numeraries.” The whole number consisted of Mitchell, Dalcho, Bowen, Alexander, de la Motta, Auld, de Lieben, Levy and Moultrie. As members died others were admitted. One was added in 1807, four in i8zz, two in 1823 and eighteen in the years 1824-1858. Then, in 1859 fourteen were added, making a total of 50 up to this time. It was in 1859 that the number of Active Members was increased to thirty-three. In the Northern, the number was set at fifty-six at the “Union” in 1867 and then raised to sixty-six in 1883. However in neither Jurisdiction has the allotted number been filled at any time. The Scottish Rite showed little progress during its early years. To go into the manifold operations of the Mother Supreme Council, now known as the Southern Jurisdiction, after it was organized, even up to 1859, would prolong this treatment beyond the limits of the picture we are endeavoring to paint. Consequently only a few obser - vations will be made to show how things went in the early years, or until Albert Pike took over and began to place the organization on a stable basis. We do not know how many bodies of the Rite were set up prior to i8oi but these we do know something about: i—Lodge of Perfection, Albany, N. Y., 1767-1774. 2—Grand Council, Princes of Jerusalem, Albany, N. Y., 1767-1774. 3 —Lodge of Perfection, Philadelphia, Pa., 1782-1789. 4 —Lodge of Perfection, Charleston, 5C., 1783-1796. s—Council of Princes of Jerusalem, Charleston, S.C., 1788. 6—Lodge of Perfection, Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., 1791-1797. 7 —Lodge of Perfection Baltimore, Md., 1792-1795. 8—Sublime Grand Council, Princes of the Royal Secret, Charleston, S. C., 1797. All, except No. ~ and No. 8 were dormant at the time of the for - mation of the Supreme Council. In 1813 a Grand Consistory was formed in Louisiana, whose powers were transferred in 1839 to a newly formed Supreme Council in New Orleans. On February 2, 1852, a Consistory was established, by our 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE Supreme Council in Louisiana. Then, on February 17, i85~, the New Orleans body signed a Concordat to become part of the regular Supreme Council, and was continued as a Grand Consistory. This was the first of a number of Grand Consistories, the next being in 1852 (Kentucky). Then followed Arkansas i8~8; Mississippi and District of Columbia i86o; Maryland i86i; Iowa i8 68 ; California 1870; and Japan ~886. However, only those of Louisiana and Kentucky survive as Grand Con - sistories. How many bodies were chartered in the Southern Jurisdiction is not known. Records up to about i8~8 have been lost, destroyed or never made. The degrees are separated in four bodies in the Southern Jurisdiction as follows: Lodges of Perfection (40 - 140); Chapters of Rose Croix (150~ 180); Councils of Kadosh (19o~ 300); and Consis - tories (31o~ 320). In the Northern Jurisdiction they are: Lodges of Perfection (40 - 140); Councils of Princes of Jerusalem (150 - 160); Chapters of Rose Croix (17o~ 180); and Consistories (i~ ~32o). When the admitting of Honorary 330 members was started is not ~lefinitely known. Pike says none were made prior to 1857 in the Southern Jurisdiction. We know that five were created at the i86o Session. However, in the Northern Jurisdiction there is at least one (Charles Gilman) who was elected a S.G.I.G. on May 3, 1854 and then received into Active Membership the following day. Whether this coiistituted an Honorary 33 rd for one day one cannot say. The first four actual records of Honorary Members were: i—Henry Atwood—April i 6 , i8~6—Active Oct. 20, 1864. z—Enoch T. Carson—May i8, i86o—Active May 20, 1862 3 —Charles T. McClenachan—Dec. 15, i86o—Active July 12, i86i. 4 —John Sheville—Sept. 30, i86i—Active June 6, i866. There are no records in either Supreme Council to show the mem - bership previous to 1870. At that time the Southern Jurisdiction had about 200 Princes of the Royal Secret and the Northern Jurisdiction about 3,200. From then on the membership figures are known and will be found in a table, herewith. The Rite was almost dormant in the South until Albert Pike be - came its leader in 1859. In i86o, in his allocution, Pike stated, “Until the session of this Supreme Council in 1859, the number of its mem - 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE bers was limited to nine, as prescribed by the Grand Constitutions of 1786. Four of these resided in Charleston, and five in states other than South Carolina. Of those residing out of that state, it is not known when one had been present at a meeting of the Council; which was thus, practically, and as far as its action was concerned, reduced to four members. It was evident that a body composed of so limited a number of persons, however eminent and learned they might be, could not possess the influence nor command the respect desirable in the Supreme Governing Body of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Much less, could this be so, when a majority never met, and the Coun - cil virtually consisted of four persons only, living in one place, and with difficulty induced to do even what routine required; anything more being beyond all hope or expectation. To give this body the weight and importance which alone could make its efficiency and usefulness worthy of its high rank, in a jurisdiction composed of nineteen states, it was necessary that those states should be represented in it. In no other way, again, could the Council really speak for the members of the Rite everywhere in its Jurisdiction and its words possess the gravity and weight of authority. With its membership thus enlarged, and after the consequent accession of intellect and learning, it was reasonable to expect that its meetings would gain greatly in dignity and importance, its recommendations go forth with more weight, and its proceedings be looked to with far more interest.” From the time Albert Pike became its head in 1859, when the Rite had but nine members in its Supreme Council for the Southern Jurisdiction, until the following year when the number was increased to thirty-three, until his passing, thirty-two years later, nothing but an upward movement is found. Albert Pike established the building on the tottering foundation he found when he entered it. THE CERNEAU RITE (So-called) It must be pointed out that when the Scottish Rite was formed in i8oi there were several Deputy Inspectors General of the Rite of Per - fection of twenty-five degrees in the United States. All of them could exercise their powers legally. The Scottish Rite had chosen to put these degrees in its system to, but they had no control over the Deputy Inspectors General of the Rite of Perfection. Very few used their 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE powers and most of those who obtained these degrees from Rite of Per - fection Deputies later affiliated with Scottish Rite bodies. Hence, in a few years no further conferring of degrees by Rite of Perfection Depu- ties prevailed. At the same time there were a few brethren who had only ob - tained the grade of Knight of the Sun (230) and had Patent6 of that degree. Two examples are Jeremiah Van Rensselaer, who had received his Patent from Henry Andrew Francken on June i, 1768, in New York, and Abraham Jacobs, who was elevated to that degree on Novem - ber g, 1790, by Moses Cohen in Kingston, Jamaica. Jacobs caused trouble by conferring the grade in various States without any idea of forming a local body of the degree. His operations in South Carolina and Georgia however (and later in New York) were recognized by Emanuel De La Motta, 330, who helped these brethren become mem - bers of Scottish Rite bodies. Now we come to another situation where the individual involved did not have the authority to do what he did where he did it. His actions caused confusion in the Scottish Rite, because some of those on whom he conferred degrees were also “healed” by De La Motta. This man was Antoine Bideaud, who was an Active Member of De Grasse’s Supreme Council in the French West India Islands, established by the Supreme Council in Charleston, South Carolina on February 21, 1802. He was in New York City, on his way to Bordeaux, France, in 1806 where he conferred the 3 2nd degree on five members of a body known as Lachelle’s Scottish Sovereign Chapter of Rose Croix de H-R-D-M of Kilwinning. For this he received $46 from each brother, or a total of $230. Bideaud’s next act was to establish a “Sublime Grand Consistory 300, 310, and 32~” in New York City. All these acts were irregular and unconstitutional, as he had no right or power within any part of the United States of America. In the mean time Jacobs was active in New York conferring the 2 3 rd degree but De La Motta healed the operations of Bideaud and Jacobs later, as will be seen. Next, and finally, we come to a third individual who began Mason - ic activity in New York which caused no end of trouble in not only 3 the Scottish Rite but in Symbolic Masonry as well. Some of this is with us even today. He was a Frenchman, Joseph Cernean, born in 3 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE Villeblevin in 1763 and was a jeweler by trade. He had established himself in San Domingo, West Indies, where he became Secretary of Lodge Reunion des Coeurs at Port Republican, under the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. In i8oz he, with many others, was compelled to flee on account of the insurrection of the negroes. He went to Cuba, where in 1804, with other Brethren, he applied to the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania for a Lodge in Havana. The petition was granted and the name of the Lodge was Le Temple des Vertus Theologalis, No. 103, with Cerneau named as Master. Due to some difficulties with the civil authorities in Cuba about the Lodge, Cerneau was ordered to quit the Island. He went to New York City in November i8o6, with his family, and established his business at 121 William Street. He affiliated with Washington Lodge No. zi in January iSia and con - tinued a member until December zo, i8z6, when he withdrew to re - turn to France, where it is believed he died about twenty years later. On July i~, i8o6, while still in Cuba he was appointed a Deputy Inspector General of the Rite of Perfection by Antoine Mathiei de Potet, who in turn had been made a Deputy Inspector General on August i~, 1799 by Germain Haquet, who had a similar Patent dated 1798 from Pierre LaBarbier Duplessis in Pennsylvania. The Patent issued to Cerneau gave him power for the Northern part of Cuba to initiate Master Masons from the 4 th to the z 4 th de - grees, who had been officers of a Lodge, and with additional power to confer the z 5 th degree on one Knight Prince Mason a Year. The powers granted by this Patent are far more limited than any other Patent known of the Rite of Perfection, but, as Baynard points out, it “has been the basis of more trouble in the Fraternity in all its branches than all other Patents, Deputations and individual powers.” Cerneau began the establishment of a Most Puissant Grand Con - sistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret, Supreme Chiefs of Exalted Masonry according to the Ancient Constitutional Scottish Rite of Heredom, on October z8, 1807, which was completed exactly a year later. The first Tableau of Officers published in 1809, contained the names of DeWitt Clinton, Martin Hoffman, Calwallader D. Cold- en and several other officers and members of the Grand Lodge of New York. While well known in Masonic circles, these men were far better 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE 5COTTI5H RITE known in New York politics. They wasted no time in using the Cer - neau body politically. However, the Bideaud Sublime Grand Consistory was then opera - ting in New York. In this body we find Daniel D. Tompkins, Sampson Simson and Ricker Biker, also members of the Grand Lodge of New York and political opponents of Clinton, Hoffman and Colden. The latter convinced Cerneau that their body should be on par with their opponent’s group and he changed the name of the organization in 1813 to a Sovereign Grand Consistory, claiming jurisdiction over thirty- two degrees. He then announced the formation of a Supreme Council of Grand Inspectors General of the Thirty-third Degree. Actually they did not use the name “Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite” until after 1827, when Cerneau had returned to France. Now, what was wrong with all this (aside from the injection of politics into the situation)? First, Cerneau had no powers to confer ANY degrees outside of Northern Cuba. Second, he had the power in that territory to confer ONLY the z 4 th degree, and in addition the z 5 th degree on one brother per year. Third, his powers were for the Rite of Perfection of twenty-five degrees only. Fourth, he never had the z6th to the 3 znd degree conferred upon him, as the Rite of Per - fection did not have these degrees. Fifth, and last, he had no 33rd degree, for the same reason. Therefore all his acts in conferring degrees beyond the z 5 th degree were clandestine as were most of those on whom he conferred the z 5 th degree, had his powers been valid in New York. That is the situation just before one of the officers of the Supreme Council in Charleston, in whose territory these goings-on were hap.- pening, arrived in New York City. This officer was given some of the details of the Masonic situation of the “Higher Degrees” and proceed - ed to act for the Supreme Council in Charleston, forthwith. THE NORTHERN JURISDICTIOIN This activity in what is now the Northern Jurisdiction, grew out of unauthorized operations of those conferring so-called Higher De - grees in and about New York, and to some extent in Philadelphia and elsewhere. I quote from Samuel Baynard’s “History of Scottish Rite Free Masonry: 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE scoTTisH RITE “The Cerneau Supreme Council of Grand Inspectors General, 330, 1813, was merely a nominal body, supreme in name only, as ir - regular as its sponsor’s acts and the Sovereign Grand Consistory, at whose behest and direction it probably conferred its spurious Thirty- third Degree upon some of the foremost Masons in the land, who had been inveigled into its web. “In the early summer of 1813, Emanuel de Ia Motta, Illustrious Treasurer General of the Supreme Council at Charleston, neither on business nor on pleasure bent but in search of health, drifted into the vortex of this Masonic whirlpool. He found five bodies, four of which were conferring the higher degrees of Freemasonry, and another which claimed to be a Supreme Council of the 33 rd degree, no one of which had been sponsored by the Supreme Council at Charleston, yet all of which were operating in the territory over which that Supreme Coun - cil had exclusive jurisdiction in the Scottish Rite. As the representative of the Supreme Council at Charleston he undertook an inquiry into the organization and nature of each of the five bodies: 1—The Bideaud Sublime Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret, 3 oth, 3 ist and 3 znd degrees. z—The Cerneau Sovereign Grand Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret of the Ancient Constitutional Scottish Rite of Heredom. 3—The Jacobs Council of Princes of Jerusalem, Concordia Crescimus. 4 —The Jacobs Aurora Grata Lodge of Perfection. s—The Cemeau Supreme Council of Sovereign Grand Inspectors Gen - eral of the Thirty-Third Degree. “Before proceeding too deeply into his investigation, he com - municated with his superior officers of the Supreme Council at Charles - ton and received prompt replies from both Sovereign Grand Command - er John Mitchell and Lieutenant Grand Commander Frederick Dalcho, directing him to proceed at once to rectify the situation, and each of them enclosed a certificate to he used by him in case of need.” After a thorough investigation of all those involved in the five groups, de Ia Motta, on September zi, 1813, healed the Bideaud and Jacobs bodies and then on August 5, 1813, formed The Supreme Coun - cil, 330 for the Northern Jurisdiction of the United States, which was 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE confirmed on December 24, 1813 by the Mother Supreme Council at Charleston. The Cerneau group had the following Sovereign Grand Com - manders: Joseph Cemeau 1807; John W. Mulligan 1821; DeWitt Clinton 1823; Elias Hicks 1832; Henry C. Atwood 1846; Jeremy L. Cross 1850; Henry C. Atwood i8~z; Edmond B. Hays ,86o and Simon W. Robinson i8 6 5. They changed the name of the organization sev - eral times and injected many illegal operations by re-organizing and revivals, but at the time of the UNION in 1867, Cemeauism became “officially” dead. THE UNION OF 1867 A full treatment of what took place from i86o to 1867 would consume many pages. In digest, these are the events: On June z~, i86o. Edward A. Raymond, Sovereign Grand Com - mander of our Supreme Council, deserted the body and elevated Peter Lawson of Massachusetts to the 33 rd degree. This operation was ille - gal in every sense because Lawson had never been elected by the Supreme Council. Then, on December 13, ,~6o, with Simon W. Robin - son and the illegally-made Lawson, Raymond established a rival Su - preme Council. Less than three years later (February ~, 1863) the Robinson body combined with the Hays (Ccrneau) group. On Decem - ber 13, i86~, Hays resigned and Simon W. Robinson was made Sover- eign Grand Commander. In December i866, Grand Commander Robinson stated to twelve other Active Members of the Hays-Robinson Council that “To place ourselves within the pale of legitimacy, and secure fraternal relations with the Southern Supreme Council and all other regular Councils, induced the Brethren to dissolve the Union Council, which has been done by unanimous consent of every member.” Nine other Active Members were not present, among them being Hopkins Thompson, Robert E. Roberts and William H. Jarvis, who we shall see again in 1881—14 years later. The twenty-two Active Members of the Union Council then held a meeting on December 13, 1866 and announced that they had revived the Raymond Council. In the mean time Killian H. Van Rensselaer had become Sovereign Grand Commander, follow - ing Raymond’s desertion, in our Supreme Council. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE 5COTTISH RITE The two Supreme Councils appointed committees to look into the possibility of effecting a union of the two bodies and on May i~, 1867 they held simultaneous Sessions in Boston, Massachusetts. Robin - son resigned as head of the Raymond body and John L. Lewis was elected Grand Commander. Van Rensselaer resigned as head of our body and Josiah H. Drummond was elected Grand Commander. The Raymond body closed sine die. This ended the so-called Cerneau Rite —voluntarily disbanded, and its membership was welcomed into the UNION. For the purposes of the amalgamation our Council also dis - banded and the Union was completed, this body becoming the present Supreme Council of the Northern Jurisdiction—the proceedings or transactions of which have been published every year since from 1867 to date. It was provided that, since two bodies had combined, that fifty-six Active Members would form the Supreme Council. This was later increased to sixty-six — 1883. Only one serious matter regarding membership has come up since the Union in 1867, which in short, was as follows: The Hays Council (Cemeau) was disbanded and dead and noth - ing more was heard of it from December 31, i866 to September 27, on which date ten 33 rd degree brethren from the old Hays Coun - cil decided that the UNION Supreme Council of 1867 was illegally erected. This seems strange when one considers that it was fourteen years before that the Union was consummated and that six of those in - volved in this undertaking had signed Oaths of Fealty to the Union Supreme Council—Thompson, Folger, Roberts, Harris, all of New York; Atwood of Connecticut and Thomson of Illinois. Furthermore, of the six, four of them had attended our Supreme Council the follow- ing number of times: Thompson—7; Atwood— 7 ; Roberts—2; and Fol - ger—i. No announcement was made why they thought the Union was illegal. Actually none of them were Active Members of the regular Supreme Council and they lacked authority to set up a Supreme Coun - cil of the Scottish Rite anywhere, nor to re-erect the Hays body which had been dead for approximately fifteen years. The fact is—they were deserters and rebels. This body carried on with considerable success for a number of years and eventually elected John J. Gorman their Sovereign Grand 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE Commander. On May zi, 1895, Gorman died and from that time on the body declined to a point that after 1925 it was dlfficult to find out who headed the body or find remnants of it anywhere. The Scottish Rite is now firmly established in the United States, both in the North and the South, and it appears before us as a stable and respected Rite of Freemasonry. ‘What we see today in our subor - dinate bodies of the Scottish Rite and at the sessions of the Supreme Council is a far cry from what took place in these bodies less than a hundred years ago. The degrees are conferred in regalia then unheard of, by casts of large numbers, customed in theatrical style by make-up specialists, in up-to-date stage settings with lighting effects to accom - pany the degree portrayals for the proper effects. Even the Temples and Auditoriums in which we meet could hardly be envisioned in the i86o’s. To this might well be added the present accommodations for dining, as well as provision for affairs in which our ladies and some times the non-Masonic public are invited as our guests. And, beyond all of this, our charitable contributions are commen - surate with our size, and worthy of praise of the highest order. The organization of the Supreme Councils is hierarchical in nature, but its subordinate bodies are democratic. The situation is unique but works well in our case. It might be said to be a combination of old world hierarchy and new world democracy. We have over four million Freemasons in the United States of America. Twenty-four percent are Scottish Rite Masons—the result of the effort of the organization since 1870 when the nte could boast of but 3,400 members, constituting but seven-tenths of one percent of the ~oo,ooo Freemasons in the country. The Scottish Rite of Free - masonry has lifted itself into prominence in our fratemity by its own boot-straps.

To begin with they selected all twenty-five degrees of the Rite of Perfection, most of which are also found in one or more of the other rites of Masonry then or previously having existed. To these were added five degrees from the French Philosophical Rite, one from the Primitive Scottish Rite and two from what Doszwdarski called the Ancient and Modem Rite—total thirty-three. The first nineteen were placed in the same order as in the Rite of Perfection. The Twentieth was made by combining the 190 and 230 of the Primitive Scottish Rite; the Twenty-first by combining the zo~ of the Rite of Perfection with the 160 of the Primitive Scottish Rite; and the Twenty-eighth by combining the 230 of the Rite of Perfection with the 240 of the Primitive Scottish Rite.

Secrecy, Silence, and Fidelity are taught in this degree. 5 0 —PERFECT MASTER Commemorates the death of GMHA and teaches that we should learn to pay due respect to the memory of a deceased worthy brother. 6 0 —INTIMATE SECRETARY King Solomon saves the life of a supposed spy, or eavesdropper. The degree teaches zealousness, faithfulness, and that we should ever be careful not to offend a brother by prying into his secrets, and that “a soft answer turneth away wrath.” 7 0 —PROVOST AND JUDGE In accordance with the legend of this degree, King Solomon found it necessary to appoint several Judges upon the death of the slain Grand Master in order that justice might be administered among the workmen of the Temple. The degree teaches Justice, Equity, and Im - partiality, and that justice should be administered with mercy. 80~INTENDANT OF THE BUILDING The construction of the Temple having been stayed due to the death of the Chief Architect, King Solomon appointed five Superin - tendents—one for each of the Five Departments of Architecture. Un - der their supervision the building progresses. The degree teaches the exercise and propagation of Charity and Benevolence, educating the orphan, comforting the sick and distressed. 9 0 —MASTER ELECT OF NINE Solomon elects nine to investigate a matter so that the offenders may be brought to justice.

The degree instructs that the true and faithful brother will, sooner or later, receive his just reward and teaches us to be Earnest, Honest, and Sin - cere. iz 0 —GRAND MASTER ARCHITECT This degree is alleged to have been established as a school of in - struction for the workmen of the Temple, to assure uniformity in work, and to reward those eminent in science and skill. The rules of archi - tecture and the connection of the liberal arts and sciences are ampli - fied. The degree teaches that Virtue is as necessary as Talent. i 3 0 —MASTER OF THE NINTH ARCH This degree forms the climax of the Ineffable Degrees; it is the keystone of the arch and discovers that which is revealed in the suc - ceeding degree of Perfection.

This degree is an introduction to the degree which follows. i8 0 —KNIGHT OF THE ROSE CROIX The novice is still in search of the Truth and the lost Word and, in his joumeys through the years, he learns the three virtues which are to guide him: Faith, Hope and Charity. He is taught the meaning of the New Law. i 9 0 —GRAND PONTIFF The eleven degrees of the Areopagus which follow unfold the er - rors and frailties of human nature.

The duties of a Knight of the Brazen Serpent are to purify the soul of its alloy of earthliness and to restore faith in God. z6 0 —PRINCE OF MERCY When Domitian was emperor of Rome and when danger and death hung on their footsteps, the Christian Masons met in the Catacombs to celebrate the Mysteries. This degree, while depicting the mysteries as practised by the first Christians, shows that Masonry is of no one age, belongs to all time, is of no one religion, and finds its great truths in all. z 7 0 —KNIGHT COMMANDER OF THE TEMPLE Dedicated to the Teutonic Knights of the House of St. Mary of Jerusalem. The Order originated at the siege of St. Jean d’Acre, when tents for the sick and wounded were made from the sails of ships.

The virtues of the Order are rehearsed and the reward for a due reverence of the obligations and observance of the vows and tenets of the Institution are exemplified. A Knight Kadosh proves himself practically a true defender of the Temple of the Most High God and, while armed with steel outwardly, he is inwardly armed with Faith and Love—Faith to God and Love for his fellow-man. 3 i 0 —GRAND INSPECTOR INQUISITOR COMMANDER The practical test of the neophyte in the preceding degree is, in this one, changed to a thorough examination under charges against Masonic law and duty before the Order of the Five Brethren.

Its object was, for a long time, to reconquer the Holy Land and plant the Banner of the Cross once more on the ruined walls of Jerusalem.

In the Southern Jurisdiction those who are elected to receive the Thirty-third Degree at the meeting of the Supreme Council (they meet every odd year) in Washington, D.C. are notified at once and will, if they can be present within the next few days, when the degree is con - ferred, be crowncd. Otherwise, they usually have the grade conferred upon them locally in Regional Conventions (since 1885). Also, there is a decoratIon only in the Southern Jurisdiction called Knight Com - mander of the Court of Honor. This rank was instituted by Albert Pike in 1870 but the statutes governing it have been revised several times. The first formal investiture was not until 1913. There is also a Grand Cross which is very rarely awarded, their being but five at present (1965). It is necessary to hold the rank of Knight Commander of the Court of Honor for at least two years before a Scottish Rite Mason of this jurisdiction is eligible to be elected to receive the Thirty - third Degree (i886 law). Election in the Southem Jurisdiction Supreme Council constitutes the recipient an Honorary Thirty-third Degree Mason. This is rather peculiar as there is one grade and one ceremony— Sovereign Grand Inspector General. 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE In the Northern Jurisdiction, which meets annually in various cities (except every third year when it meets in Boston, Massachusetts), those elected await crowning until the following year. The recipients there become Honorary Members of the Supreme Council and with a voice at the General Sessions, but no vote. APPENDIX C THE ROSE CROIX DEGREE More literature has appeared regarding this grade or degree than any other, excluding the Symbolic Degrees. Still little is known about it except where it has or is worked and very little has come to light as to when or where it originated or by whom it was compiled. This situation is true for many other degrees, like the Royal Arch, but in a lesser extent. It is cited here to show what faces historical researchers of Masonic degrees. To trace what is known of the Scottish Rite degrees would fill several volumes but little would be learned about their advents. There is a mention of a Rose Croix Order by Andrea in 1613 but we have found no documented evidence of a Masonic Rose Croix Degree until the middle of the eighteenth century. It is not clear just which of the degrees having the name Rose Croix or Red Cross are Christian or otherwise. Knight Rose Croix, also called Prince Rose Croix; Sovereign Prince Rose Croix; Rose Croix de Heroden or Here - dom; and Knight of the Eagle and Pelican, is one of the earliest, most widely disseminated, and most popular of all of the Hauts Grades. It is found at least in the following systems: i8—Rite of Perfection i8—Emperors of the East and West i8—Scottish Rite 7 —French Rite 2—Royal Order of Scotland 12—Elect of Truth 1 2—Adonhiramite Rite 7 —Philalethes 6—Baldwin Encampment ~—Philosophic Scottish Rite 6—Primitive Rite of Narbonne 46—Rite of Mizraim 53"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE i8—Rite of Memphis i—Templar System in U.S.A. i~—Holy Royal Arch Knight Templar Priest System 4 i—Early Grand Rite of Scotland 7 —Grand Lodge Royal York of Friendship—Berlin i—Schroeder’s Rectified Rite ti—Dames or Ladies of Beneficence (*) Even the ladies have the degree. It must be noted that although the names of these degrees are “Rose Croix” or “Red Cross”, it does not follow that they are the same degree or ritual. In fact many of the rituals are extant and while some have the same theme or lesson, some show no similarity to what is generally accepted as the, or a, Rose Croix liturgy. APPENDIX D U. S. PRESIDENTS AND THE THIRTY-THIRD DEGREE There has been some loose talk about Presidents of the United States being Thirty-third Degree Masons. Actually but one President has had this honor—Harry S. Truman. He was crowned in Washington, DC. on October 19, 1945. He was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Missouri in 1940 and signed the Dispensation and Charter of the Missouri Lodge of Research of which he became its Master in 1950, while President. Warren Gamaliel Harding was elected to receive the 330 on September 22, 1921. On September 20, 1922 he wrote a letter to the Sovereign Grand Commander stating that he could not be present. He was given an extension of one year but died before the degree was conferred. An oddity in this case is that he became an Entered Apprentice on June 28, 1901, received his Fellowcraft on August 13, 1920 and Master Mason on August 27, 1920. A short time later he became a member of a great many Masonic bodies and visited very frequently. NOTES ON U. S.

APPENDIX E FOREIGN SUPREME COUNCILS One of the things not generaly known is that several practices in operating the Scottish Rite in the United tSates are not universal. Most of the other Supreme Councils do not confer all of the twenty- nine degrees, and none confer any in the dramatic form prevalent in our country. In England, for instance, the Eighteenth Degree, conferred in Rose Croix Chapters is the sole “operative” degree The Supreme Council confers (amply) those starting with the thirtieth on very limit - ed numbers. There are but nine Thirty-thirds and they constitute the Supreme Council. There are various other differences. Large numbers 6o"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE of members in the Scottish (Ancient & Accepted) Rite are unknown. The following countries have Supreme Councils, but recognition by our United States Supreme Councils varies from time to time, due to “upheavals”, both political and Masonic. It is difficult, in some coun - tries, to determine, when there is more than one Supreme Council in a country, which meets our requirements for recognition.
