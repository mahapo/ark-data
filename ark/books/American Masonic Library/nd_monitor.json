Freemasonry as we know it, had its origin late in ~he 17th Century when “gentlemen” sought and secured member - ship in the old Craft Guilds or Fellow - ships of Operative Masons. Four lodges in London, known by their meeting places, as (1) Goose and Gridiron Ale House in St. Paul’s Church Yard; (2) Crown Ale House in Parker’s Lane; (3) Apple Tree Tavern in Charles Street, Con - vent Garden, and (4) Rummer and Grapes Tavern in Channel Row, Westminster, met and feasted on St. John’s Day, June 24th, 1717, at the Goose and Gridiron Ale House. Then and there was formed the first Grand Lodge of Masons. Anthony Sayer, “gentle - man” was elected Grand Master. The Grand Lodge of Ireland was organized in 1730, and the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1736.

In 1734 this was reprinted in America by one Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia. Freemasonry prospered in England from the organization of the Grand Lodge in 1717. In 1751 the great Schism took place and the Atholl or Grand Lodge of Ancients was organized. Lawrence Dermott was the moving spirit in this new organization. The older Grand Lodge was known as the Grand Lodge of Moderns. The introduction of the legend of Hiram and the consequent loss of the true Masonic Word is believed to have been the primary cause for the division, tho some Masonic students during recent years have ques - tioned this. In 1813 these two Grand Lodges came together and organized the United Grand Lodge of England, which continues today. Symbolic Masonry Defined “it is declared and pronouced that pure Ancient Masonry consists of three (legrees, and no more, viz, those of the L. Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Mason (including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch).” From Articles of Union, 1813. With the coming of Colonists to America, Freemasonry found its way here also. There are fairly well authenticated statements that Freemasons were known to have come to America even before 1717. In 1730 Daniel Cox of New Jersey was appointed Provincial Grand Master of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In 1733 Henry Price was appointed to a similar position for New England. These brethren represented the Grand Lodge of England (Moderns). Lodges were chartered in the various colonies by both Grand Lodges of England, also by the Grand Lodge of Scotland and the Grand Lodge of Ireland. There were also military lodges attached to various bodies of British troops stationed in America during the colonial period.

NORTH DAKOTA In connection with the Lewis & Clark expedition it is known that they established a camp in the vicinity of the present city of Washburn during the winter of 1804 and 1805. They remained some six months. General Merriwether Lewis was a Master Mason, A Past Master of a Pennsylvania Lodge and the first Master of St. Louis Lodge No. 1, though this was after his sojourn within the present boundaries of North Dakota. His associate, William Clark, also become a Master Mason at St. Louis after he returned from his ex - nedition. The site of this camp is marked, HI5TORICAL FACT5 the marker and tablet were dedicated in the spring of 1935. The first permanent lodges in Dakota Territory were in the Southeast corner near the Iowa line and were chartered by the Grand Lodge of Iowa, the first being St. John at Yankton, in 1863. The first Lodge in North Dakota was organized by the Grand Lodge of Minnesota in Hatch’s Battalion which was going to garrison Fort Pembina. This was known as Northern Lights Lodge. It was transferred in 1864 to Ft. Garry, now Winnipeg, but the charter was never delivered, and later it ceased to exist. On June 21, 1921, the Grand Lodge of North Dakota dedicated a marker on the site of the old quartermasters building Fort Pembina, in which this lodge met. The entire site is now a Masonic Park. The Grand Lodge of Manitoba joined in this celebration. In 1964 the Grand Lodge of Manitoba celebrated the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Freemasonry in that province."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"12 MONITOR HISTORICAL FACTS EMERGENCY LODGES An emergency lodge was opencd on the last Sunday in July, 1863, to bury Lt. Beavers, an English soldier of fortune and an Oxonian, attached to the staff of Gen. Sibley.. He had been killed in a skirmish with the Indians on Apple Creek near Bismarck. This lodge was convened by Deputy Grand Master John C. Whipple, who was connected with the expedition. Among the officers of this emergency lodge were Brothers A. J. Edgerton and J. C. Braden, both of whom were arterwards prominent in Minnesota, and Braden was Grand Master. This was without doubt the first Masonic ceremony held in the present State of North Dakota We now have record of two Masonic funerals held in 1864. At Fort Rice on August 9th, 1864, the funeral of Brother George F. Clark was conducted in the presence of seventy-eight Masons, officers and soldiers in Gen. Sully’s command. Principally they belonged to the 6th and 7th Iowa Cavalry. Brother M. W. Getchell, Worshipful Master of Cataract Lodge No 2, Minnesota, conducted the ceremonies h. p I On August 25th, 1864, there was held at Ft. Abercrombie the Masonic funeral of Frederick Duhn, killed by the Indians. He was a member of North Star No. 23, St. Cloud. This ceremony was conducted by Quartermaster C. W. Nash who had been one of the group of soldiers to whom a dispensation had been granted to organize a lodge at Pembina in 1863. It is probable that other Masonic fun erils were held dur - ing these troublesome years, but so far our Grand Historian has not found the records. On January 26th, 1871, Yellowstone Lodge No. 88 was organized at Fort Buford by the issuance of a dispensation to Brother Asa T. Blunt as Worshipful Master. He was an officer of the 7th Infantry and formerly a member of Passumpsic Lodge No. 27, St. Johnsbury, Vt. There were eleven Charter members, siic of them officers of the 7th Infantry. During 1871-72 and 73, this lodge was active.

In 1874 the removal of the troops made it im - possibLe to get enough members to open a lodge. Later the charter was surrendered. The first permanent lodge in North Dakota was Shilob, Fargo, organized in 1873 and chartered by the Grand Lodge of Minnesota, January 14th, 1874, as Shiloh Lodge No. 105. (The spelling in the Charter is “Shilo”.) W. H. Smith is named as Worshipful Master, Samuel G. Roberts, Senior Warden and Jacob Lowell, Junior Warden. A little later in 1874 a lodge was organized at Bismarck, but for some reason the first organization was not granted a charter. A charter was granted, however, Jan. 11th, 1876, with Brothers Clement A. Lounsberry, Worshipful Master, John A. McLean, Senior Warden and E. M. Brown, Junior Warden. By 1875 five lodges had been chartered in the southeastern part of Dakota Terri - tory. A convention was called at Elk Point, June 22-23, 1875, and the Grand Lodge of Dakota Territory was organized. The lodges at Fargo and Bismarck were not repre - sented; various reasons are assigned. These two lodges still continued to give their allegiance to the Grand Lodge of Minnesota in spite of efforts to have them transfer their allegiance to the Grand Lodge of Dakota where they properly belonged. A bitter controversy raged with the Grand Lodge of Minnesota, which insisted on its right to maintain lodges in the territory of Dakota in the face of the established rule of American Masonic jurisdiction and the undoubted right of the Grand Lodge of Dakota Territory to their allegiance. A most interesting bit of local Masonic history is to be found in this incident. In 1879 Shiloh sent in the Minnesota Charter to the Grand Lodge of Dakota, it was validated and reissued to Shiloh Lodge No. 8, now ~o. 1, on the North Dakota registry. Bismarck came in, after three other lodges were chartered in the northern part of the territory; namely at Pembina, Casselton and Grand Forks, hence instead of being No. 2, on the North Dakota Register, Bismarck is No. 5.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CRAFT VISITORS “In every clime a Mason may find a home, and in every land a brother”. The Lodge is his home, and every member present should give him a fraternal wel - come, and make him feel that he is not a stranger but a brother among them. EXAMINATIONS Before admission the visitor must prove to the satisfaction of the Lodge that he is a Mason in good standing. The examina - tion should be thorough, and sufficiently strict to prevent imposition. It is assumed that the visiting brother is genuine there - fore give him a cordial welcome. The examining committee is not expected to find out just how much the visiting brother knows of Masonry, but simply satisfy themselves, through the proper tests, that he is entitled to visit. More than this would seem unwarranted, and contrary to good Masonic ethics."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"A MONITOR The following is a suitable form for a Test Oatn to be administered I ,.~, do hereby and hereon solemnly and sincerely swear that I have been regularly initiated, passed and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason in a regularly constituted Lodge of such; that I am not now under suspension or expulsion, and know of no reason why I should not hold Masonic Communication with my brethren. So help me God. Let the examination be thorough but courteous. pbject of Masonry harmony among the brethren is the first object in Masonry. Not all those who have passed through our solemn ceremonies, and arc called Masons, are truly such. Still, the general law holds good It is the duty of the Worshipful Master to preserve harmony among the members of his lodge, and if a visiting brother i~ objected to by a member of the Lodge, the visitor must give precedence to the member who, by reason of his membership, has rights differing from those of the visitor MONITORIAL INSTRUCTIONS 31 The objection of a member should be heeded by the Worshipful Master, whether any reason be given therefor or not. BaUotmg for Candidates In this, and many other Jurisdictions, one ballot only is required for the three degrees and for membership. The result of the bal - lot is announced “clear” or “not clear.” After a candidates election, he may be stop - ped by a secret objection lodged with the Master which operates as a black ball un - less withdrawn before next communication. Great care should be taken before ballot - ing to ascertain the worth and qualifications of the applicant.”Guard well the outer door,” is a saying which cannot be too well heeded. But when accepted and initiated, be becomes a Mason; he then has rights differing from a profane. hence, his advancement can be stopped by lack of proficiency or the filing of charges for unMasonic conduct.

The Worshipful Master is not limited in his authority in his own lodge except by appeal to the Grand Master or Grand Lodge, yet he is expected to govern with justice and moderation. Masonry stands for freedom of discussion, hence opportunity should be given every brother to be heard, though no brother should be permitted to monopolize the floor, nor should violent language or personal abuse be tolerated.

It is proper that the brethren shall have any facts rela - tive to the character of a petitioner which will guide them in casting a ballot, for the good of Masonry, even though this informa - tion comes from the floor and not from the Investigating Committee.

In the absence of brethren of past or present Masonic title any of the brethren present may be selected for the purpose.

The announcement will then be made through the Tiler and Junior Deacon that the committee with the Grand Master are prepared to enter. As they pass the Tiler’s door, the Lodge will be called up and the brethren will remain standing until seated by the usual signal. (There should be ap - propriate instrumental music during all these movements). The procession will re - pair to the altar two by two in the order already indicated, the four brethren in the lead passing sufficiently to the North to leave the two in the rear directly west of the altar.

But though in ancient Times Masons were charg’d in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, what- L ever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more ex - pedient only to oblige them to that Re - ligion in which all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themse[ves; that s, to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denomincations or Persuasions they may be distinguish’d; whereby Masonry becomes the Center of Union, and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remain’d at a perpetual Distance.

You are to be congratulated upon having been found worthy to pass the unanimous ballot of the members of this Lodge, and it is of the utmost importance that you so conduct yourself as to he always worthy of this confidence. The Order with which you are seeking to unite is known in this State as Ancient Free and Accepted Masonry; ancient as having a recorded history of more than two centuries, and still more ancient as having come down from the Guilds or fellowship of Operative Masons, who worked upon those wonderful Cathedrals and other public buildings in Europe which were constructed during the middle ages, and which have been and still are the marvel of all who behold them.

Accepted Masonry, or Speculative Mason - ry, as distinguished from Operative: Opera - tive Masonry flourished during the late middle ages, especially during the period of Calhedral building, then it waned. After the burning of London in 1666, there was a revival of the Guilds of Operative Masons because of the great demand for craftsmen. Following the rebuilding of London, Opera - tive Masonry again began to decline; then it was that the Speculative or Accepted Masons began to appear. The Transition to Accepted Masonry came, about the beginning of the 18th Century, when many gentlemen, scholars, scientists and clergymen, sought; and ob - tained admission to the Guilds of Operative Masons, and were known as Gentlemen, or Accepted Masons. From 1717 with the organization of the Grand Lodge of Eng - land, Masonry has been Speculative rather than Operative. Our Order intends to make good men bet - ter, and thus, wiser and happier, men capa - ble of rendering large service to their fellow men. This is its main object.

It is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Masonly, and that Masonic charity should be equally extensive. 5UPPORT5 It is metaphorically supported by three great pillars, denominated Wisdom, Srength and Beauty, because it is necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings.

LODGEs—How SITUATED All Lodges are, or ought to be, situated due east and west, because King Solomon’s Temple was so situated. King Solomon’s Temple was so situated because after Moses had safely conducted the Children of Isreal through the Red Sea, when pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he, by Divine com - mand, erected a tabernacle and situated it due east and west, to perpetuate the remem - brance of that remarkable east wind which wrought their mighty deliverance, and like- wise the better to receive the rays of the rising sun. As this tabernacle was a model for King Solomon’s Temple, so ought all Lodges to be situated due east and west. TO WHOM DEDICATED Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solomon, who is said to have been our first Most Excellent Grand Master. But Masons, in modern times, dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were two eminent Christian patrons of Masonry; and since their time there is, or ought to be, represented in every regular and well-governed Lodge, a certain Point within a Circle; the Point representing an individual brother, the Circle the boundary line of his duty, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions or prejudices to betray him. This circle is embordered by two per - pendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangel - ist; upon the top rests the Holy Scriptures. In passing around this circle, we necessarily touch upon both lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially err. _________________ 4= II"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"00 MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE 91 TENETS The tenets of our profession are Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.

RELIEi To relieve the distressed is a duty meum - bent on all men, but particularly oii Masons, who are linked together by an in - disoluble chain of sincere affection.

This virtue is not only consistent with Divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society, and as justice in a great measure consitutes the really good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate from the minutest principles thereof ***(20..29)**** (In former times) Entered Apprentices served their masters with FREEDOM, FERVENCY AND ZEAL which are emblematically represented by Chalk, Charcoal and Clay. r -4"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"94 MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE 95 There is nothing freer than Chalk the sllghtest touch of which leaves a trace behind.

Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that iViasonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected. Neither are you to suffer your Zeal for the institution to lead you into argument with those who through ignorance, may ridicule it.

Coming from the ignorance and darkness of the outer world, his first craving is for light—not that phys - ical light which springs from the great orb of day as its fountain, but that intellectual light which emanates from the primal source of all things, from the Great Arch - itect of the Universe—the Creator of the sun, and of all things that it illuminates. Hence the great, the primary object of the first degree is to symboliZe that birth of in - tellectual light into the mind; and the Entered Apprentice is the type of un - regenerate man, groping in moral and mental darkness, and seeking for the light which is to guide his steps and point him to the path which leads to duty and to lThm who gives to duty its reward.

Of Its Antejuity From the first formatioii of .~ociety order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across the top to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint, originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. Claseificatina The five orders are thus classed :——The Tuscan, Done, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. The Tuecani Is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and entablature have but few moldings.

In after times, when it began to be adorned it gained the name of Doric; for when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan pre - cedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in its original state. The Ionic’ Bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its col - iimn is nine diameters high, its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentils.

The Corinthiani The richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented wIth curious devices, the cor - nice with dentils and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth, by Callimachus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the following re - markable circumstance :--Accidentally pass - ing by the tomb of a young lady, he per - ceived a basket of toys covered with tile, placed over an ,acanthus root, having been left there by her nurse.

ANCIENT ORDERS’ Of these five orders, the Ionic, Doric and Corinthian, as the most ancient, are most esteemed by Masons. The Ionic, from the skill and ingenuity displayed in its con - struction, is emblematic of the column of Wisdom, which is situated in the East part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Worshipful Master; the Done, from the massive strength of its str~icture, is emble - matic of the column of Strength, which is situated in the west part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Senior Warden; and the Corinthian, from the exuberance of its ornaments, is emblematic of the column of Beauty, which is situated in the south part of the Lodge and is represented by the Junior Warden. ** (59-20) ‘~* iUsc of the follo,vinr section is optional A liii"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"112 MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT THE FIVE HUMAN 5EN5E5 Which are Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smell - ing and Tasting. The first three—Hearing, Seeing and Feeling, are deemed peculiarly essential among Masons. Hearing’ Is that sense by which we distinguish sounds and are capable of enjoying all the agree - able charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and recip - rocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires, and thus our reason is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy The wise and beneficient Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most import - ant part of our knowledge by the inform - ation of others. For these purposes, we are endowed with hearing, that by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our hap - piness may be complete. sceingi Is that sense by which we distinguish ob - jects, and in an instant of time, without ~1ie of the folloning sect,un in u~,tional change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of Nature. By this sense, we find our way on the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary oi~bs and make new discover - ies in the sphere of fixed stars. Nay, more; by it we perceive the tempers and dis - positions, the passions and affections of our fellow creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which administer to this sense are the most astonishing part of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculii~r object of admiration.

Feclingi Is that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of bodies, such as heat, and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figures, solidity, motion and extension. 5meiling Is that sense by which we distInguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vege - table bodies, and, indeed, most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effiuva of vast subtility, as well as in the state of life and growth, as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effluvia being drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all bodies are smelled. Hence it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in respiration. iljse of the following section is optional Tastingi Enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of food. The organ of this sense guards th~ entrance of the alimentary canal as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situa - tion of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by Nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nause - ous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by it we are capable of dis - cerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. Smelling and tasting are inseparably con - nected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices.

Logici Is that science which directs us how to form clear and distinct ideas of things and there - by prevents us from being misled by their similiture or resemblance. Of all the human sciences, that concerning man is certainly most worthy of the human mind, and the proper manner of conducting its several powers in the attainment of truth and knowledge.

All the works of the Almighty are made in number, weight and measures, therefore, to understand them rightly, we ought to understand arithematical calculations, and the greater advancement we make in the mathematical sciences, the more capable we shall be of considering such things as are the ordinary objects of our conceptions, and be thereby led to a more comprehensive knowledge of our great Creator and the works of the creation.

There are few who have not felt its charms, and acknowledged its expressions to be intelligible to the heart. It is a language of delightful sensations, far more eloquent than words; it breathes to the ear the clearest intimations; it touches and gently agitates the agreeable and sub - lime passions; it wraps us in melancholy, and elevates us in joy; it dissolves and in- flames; it melts us in tenderness; and ex - cites us to war.

This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valu - able monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The Attentive Ear receives the sound from the Instructive Tongue, and the Mysteries of Masonry are safely lodged in the repositories of Faithful Breasts.

As labor is the divinely appointed lot of man, in this degree the rewards of industry are set forth in emblematic forms, and the recipient is taught the exercise of diligence and industry, that by the faithful perform - ance of his task he may, in due time, be en - titled to the wages for whieb he has wrought FELLOW Cit 4FT i27 But man was not intended for physical labor only.

Hence, the Fellow-Craft’s degree, as a type of this state of manhood, is particularly devoted to science. The mind of the recip - ient is fixed, by the nature of its ritual, upon the wonders of nature and art.

It is said to have been supported by four - teen hundred and fifty-three columns and two thousand nine hundred and six pilasters all hewn from the finest Par ian marble. It was symbolically supported also by three columns, Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, because there should be wisdom to contrIve, strength t.o slIpport and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. These Pillars represent our three ancient Grand Masters, Solomon King of Israel, Hiram King of Tyre and Hiram Abiff. The Pillar of Wisdom represents Sol.

All these were classed and arrang - ed in such a manner by the wisdom of Solomon, that neither envy, discord ,nor confusion was suffered to interrupt or disturb the peace and good fellowship which prevailed among the workmen. In front of the magllifleelit l)oIell w elI placed two celebrated plIlars—one on the left hand and one oii the right hand.

It teaches us that, as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones, never sitting down contented while our fellow creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve them without inconvenience to ourselves. When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless and md - gent than the brute creation; he lies lang - uishing for days, months and years, totally incapable ot providing sustenance for him - self, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather.

Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the coin- mon stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of Nature, a useless member of society andl llnworthy of our protection as Masons.

The following Symbolism of the Degree nay be given If the first degree is intended as a repre - sentation of youth, and the second of man - hood, the third, or Master Mason, is em - blematic of old age, with its trials, its suffer - ings and its final termination in death. The time for toiling is now over, the opportunity to learn has passed away; the spiritual tem - ple that we all have been striving to erect in our hearts is now nearly completed, and the wearied workman awaits only the word of the Grand Master of the Universe to call him from the labors of earth to the eternal refreshment of heaven. Hence, this is by far the most solemn and impressive of the degrees of Masonry; and it has, in conse - quence of the profound truths which it in - culcates, been distinguished by the Craft as the Sublime degree.

It was the single object of all the ancient rites and mysteries practiced in the very bosom of pagan darkness, shining as a soli - tary beacon in all that surrounding gloom, and cheering the philosopher in his weary pilgrimage of life, to teach the immortality of the soul. This is still the great design of the third degree of Masonry. This is the scope and aim of its ritual. The Master Mason represents man, when youth, ii~nii - MASTER MASON 147 hood, old age, and life itself have passed away as fleeting shadows, yet raised from the grave of iniquity, and quickened into another and better existence. By its legend and all its ritual, it is im - plied that we have been redeemed from the death of sin and the sepulchre of pollution. “The ceremonies and the lecture,” as a dis - tinguished writer has observed, “beautifully illustrate this all-engrossing subject, and the conclusion we arrive at is, that youth, properly directed, leads us to the honorable and virtuous maturity, and that the life ol man, regulated by morality, faith and justice, will be rewarded at its closing hour by the prospect of eternal bliss.” CHARGE Brother: Your zeal for the institution of Masonry, the progress you have made in our mysteries, and your conformity to our regulations, have pointed you out as a proper object of our favor and esteem.

STATEMENT FOLLOWING MASTER MASON DEGREE My Brother. You have this evening been raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. Doubtless the ceremonies incident to this degree have left an impression upon your mind that MASTER MASON 151 will never be effaced. It would be strange however, if some points were not so clear as others, and that you may have as com - plete an understanding of this degree as p6ssible, this simple statement is made. The several Masonic degrees in Ancient Craft Masonry teach fundamental religious truths. As an Entered Apprentice your at - tention was directed to the Mason’s faith in and dependence upon Almighty God. As a Fellow Craft, Reverence for God was es - pecially called to your attention, and now in the Master Mason degree which you have just received, that other wonderful and all important lesson of Immortality, or as some think of it, the Continuing Life has been brought home to you. You have been im - pressed with the thought that what is called Death is not the end, and that because of our faith in God and by reason of the strength of the Lion of the tribe of Judab, there is no death to that imperishable part of man,—the Soul.

You should be examples of good order and regularity, for it is only by a due regard to the laws, in your own conduct, that you can expect obedience to them from others. You are assiduously to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust, diffus - mg light and imparting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of the Master you will succeed to higher duties; your acquirements must therefore be such that the Craft may never suffer for want of proper instruction. From the spirit which you have hitherto evinced, I entertain no doubt that your future con - duct will be such as to merit the applause of your brethren, and the promptings of a good conscience."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"‘U 174 MONITOR CHARGE TO THE nRETHREN Brethren of Lodge No..

A Lodge shall bury a deeeased member with Masonic rites, if requested by the deeeased in his lifetime, or by his near relatives after his death. In all other eases such Masonic honors may be granted or withheld by the Lodge. The only Masonic clothing permissible at a Masonic funeral is white gloves and aprons, the officers’ collars and jewels (when collars are not worn, the officers’ jewels) and Marshal’s scarf. Entered Apprentices and Fellow Crafts may be allowed in all processions, except funcial processions Page 54 A Lodge is prohibited from burying a deceased brother with Masonic ceremonies or from joining in the funeral procession thereof, as a Lodge, or in a body, unless it has entire control thereof It may permit the Templars, or other oiganiration of which deceased was a member, to act as an escort. Pages 44-58 While a Lodge is not obh~cd to bury a non-affiliated ni aii cxcluded Mason with Masonic rites, it may do so. HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS TO THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER Only Master Masons can unite in a funtral procession. The ceremonies observed on the occasion of funerals are highiy appropriate. They are performed as a Masonic duty, and as a token of respect and affection to the memory of a departed brother. No Freemason can be buried with the formalities of the Craft, unless it be at his own request, or at the request of some of his family or relatives, communicated to the Worship - ful Master of the Lodge of which he died a member—foreign~ ers or sojourners excepted nor unless he has received the Master Mason’s degree, and from this restriction thers can be no exception. The Worshipful Master of a Lodge having received notice of a Master Mason’s death, and of his request to be buried with the ceremonies of the Craft, fixes the date and hour for the funeral, and ordeni the Secretary to notify the members of the Lodge He may invite as many Lodges as he thinks proper, ‘I I and the members of those Lodges may accompany their officers in form. The whole ceremony however, must be under the direction of the Worshipful ~eIaster of toe Lodge of which the deceased was a member, and he and his officers must be duly honored and cheerfully obeyed on the occasion, except when the Grand Master or Deputy Grand Master is present and exercises his authority; in that case, they are the ranking officers in the order named. In cases where the deceased was not a member of either of the attending Lodges, the procession and ceremony must be under the direction of the Worshipful Master of the oldest Lodge. All the brethren who waik in procession should observe, as much as possible, uniformity in their dress; dark clothes with white gloves and aprons, a band of black crepe on the left arm, and a sprig of evergreen on the left lapel of the coat, are most appropriate The most profound solemnity and decorum should be observed in a funeral Lodge and in the public exercises. The Worshipful Master of the Lodge should see that a sufficient quantity of evergreen; white gloves and aprons, and black crepe, are in readiness for the brethren at the appointed time and place; also provide conveyances, if any are reqmred, and that all other neesseary preparations be made. The worshipful Master, oi other officer in charge, should vs strict attention to all details, and announce them to the ~rethren in Ledge assembled. Confusion and embarasement are thus avoided, as the brethren better understand what is to be done. Dignity and solemmty are given to the ceremony when details are attended to and properly performed. SERVICES IN THE LODGE ROOM The hour fixed for the communication having arrived, and the brethren being assembled in the Lodge room, or some other convenient and secure place, the Worshipful Master, or presiding officer, opens the Lodge in the Master Mason’s degree.

But Masonry has no such tribunal to sit in judgment upon her dead; with her, the good that her sons have done lives after them, and the evil is buried with their bones.
