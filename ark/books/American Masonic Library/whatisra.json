TO THE MASTER MASON:— The symbolic degrees of Entered Ap - prentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason, as conferred in the United States are degrees of the York Rite. You, therefore, as a Master Mason, have received the first three degrees of that Rite. It is perfectly natural that having begun your Masonic work in that Rite, you should want to continue it. The Royal Arch Chapter offers you that opportunity, for in its last degree— the Royal Arch — is to be found the very essence of pure Freemasonry! Even the Mother Grand Lodge of Eng - land recognizes this fact and many years ago set forth as Paragraph 1 of its General Laws and Regulations: By the solemn Act of Union between the two Grand Lodges of Freemasons of England in December, 1813, it was “declared and pro - nounced that PURE ANCIENT MASONRY consists of three degrees and no more, vis. those of the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow- craft, and the Master Mason. INCLUDING THE SUPREME ORDER OF THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"And today, in England, the Grand Mas - ter of the Grand Lodge, by virtue of his Grand Lodge office, is also the head of the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons. But on the North American Continent, you will find some additional degrees in the system, supplementing the work of the Lodge and the Royal Arch. These degrees are the degrees of Mark Master, Past Mas - ter and Most Excellent Master, and all are a part of the Capitular system. The degrees of the lodge, chapter, and council, and the orders conferred in the commandery have been arranged into a system or Rite, re - ferred to as the American, Canadian, or York Rite of Freemasonry. DEMOCRACY OF THE RITE Now if there is anything about this Rite which distinguishes it, it is its DE - MOCRACY. Its degrees, orders, offices and honors are open to all. Merit constitutes the only requirement for honors; the breth - ren with whom you labor are the judges of your deserts. The value of any institution is in the contacts which it affords; the Chapter of - fers you the contacts afforded by 3,000 Royal Arch Chapters in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the American posses - sions, together with the thousands of chap - ters working under England, Scotland, and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ireland—in fact, more than a million Royal Arch Masons — and a Chapter in almost every country in the civilized world. To those who are interested in Masonic philosophy or ritual, the Capitular degrees will particularly appeal; they contain no abstruse philosophy or unintelligible doc - trines, but do contain simple, plain state - ments of Truth, easily understandable and helpful in our relation to life. The Lodge symbolism deals with the material side of life. The Chapter degrees, and particularly the Royal Arch, with the spiritual side of life. The fees for the degrees are low; the dues will be found moderate. OLDEST AND LARGEST RITE Founded as a national organization in 1797, existent in all parts of the civilized world, you will, upon your exaltation as a Royal Arch Mason, become a member of the oldest and largest Rite of Freemasonry in the World. Any Royal Arch Mason will be happy to present your name as a candidate for ad - vancement in the mysteries of Freemason - ry. You will be happy when you have received this ADDITIONAL Masonic Light."}]
