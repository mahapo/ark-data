THE FOURTH EDITION (10) In 1905, on recommendation of the Grand Master, the Grand Secretary (H. B. Grant) was \"instructed to prepare and have printed an edition of 1,000 copies, following the general make - up and arrangement of the 1893 edition\" of the Book of Constitutions, but not to issue it until after the next session - owing to financial conditions. He rewrote the Constitution upon a new plan (substantially the same in style as it now appears) and offered it as an amendment to the Constitution, with other suggestions all printed in the Proceedings of 1906. The proposed amendment was referred to a committee consisting of W. C. McChord, Jas. Garnett, and H. B. Grant, who reported it back (1907) with amendments all of which were re - committed, and the committee enlarged by ad ding to it the names of Geo. B. Winslow, John D. Shaw, the Grand Master, and all Past Grand Masters. When completed, it was to be printed and copies be sent to lodges. The Constitution as reported by the committee was adopted and printed in the Proceedings of 1908. It was engrossed, bound in leather, reported by a special committee (W. C. McChord and H. B. Grant) and deposited in the Grand Lodge vault. H. B. Grant, Geo. B. Winslow, and E. B. Beard were appointed to revise the Regulations, recommending new ones as deemed proper, have the same printed and sent to lodges. Their report was adopted by unanimous vote. The same committee was instructed to compile the Book of Constitutions, correct errors and have it printed in proper book form, to include the C onstitution, Regulations and Code. Following the foregoing instructions, with the understood wishes of the Grand Lodge as set out in the adopted recommendations of the Jurisprudence Committee (1905, p. 35), 1,100 copies of this book were prepared by the committee and a copy was sent to each subordinate lodge in Kentucky, to the elective Grand Officers, Past Grand Masters, and Grand Lodges with whom the Grand Lodge of Kentucky is in fraternal correspondence. (11) In 1916 there was issued a Supplement to the Fourth Edition, bearing the following title: \"Supplement to the Book of Constitutions; containing a Digest of the Decisions, Resolutions and Edicts of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky, and a list of the Amendments to the Book of Constitutions since the adop tion of the present Constitution, October 22, 1908: Prepared by Henry Pirtle. Published by Order of the Grand Lodge.\" The authority for this book is to be found in the recommendation of the Grand Master (1915), as approved by the Grand Lodge: \"Brother Henry Pirtle has submitted to me a digest of the decisions and opinions of the Grand Lodge and the amendments to the Book of Constitution made since the publication of the last edition of our Book of Constitutions. I had felt the need of such a work during the year, and had in mind to prepare one for my own use; in fact, I started on the work at one time, but had no opportunity to finish it. I was much pleased when Brother Pirtle submitted to me a typewritten copy of his work. It is a great labor - saver, and I reversed myself on two of my opinions after reading it. He agrees to complete it so as to embrace all decision, opinions and amendments up to the close of this annual communication. It will not be a large book, not expensive to print, and would be in th e nature of a supplement to our present Book of Constitutions. I recommend that the Grand Lodge have 1,000 copies thereof printed, and that one copy be sent to each subordinate lodge in the state, and the others distributed to such individuals as may apply for same.\" (Proc., 1915, pp. 63 and 64). Upon this the Finance Committee made the following report, which was adopted: \"We approve of the recommendation of the Grand Master that a digest of constitutional amendments and decisions be printed in pamphle t form, to be used as an appendix to the Book of Constitutions.\" (Proc., 1915, p. 157.)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"  THE FIFTH EDITION (12) The authority for the Fifth Edition of the Book of Constit utions is to be found in the following resolution, which was adopted in 1918, upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee. \"WHEREAS, It appears from the report of the Grand Secretary that the present edition of our Book of Constitutions is practically exhausted and it will be necessary to print a new edition. \"Be It Resolved, That Brother Henry Pirtle be requested to revise the book, placing therein all new laws and regulations down to date ( but with - out power to change or enact new laws), the revision to be made under the supervision of the incoming Jurisprudence Committee, and 1,000 copies be printed under the direction and approval of the Grand Secretary.\" (See Proc., 1918, pp. 127, 137). As the editor of this edition was appointed chairman of the incoming Jurisprudence Committee, the proofs were presented to the other two members, who endorsed thereon the following approval: \"Pursuant to the provisions of the resolution adopted December 10, 1918, we hereby certify that we have examined the revision of the Book of Constitutions prepared by Brother Henry Pirtle under the terms of said resolution, and hereby approve the same as being a true, accurate and complete compilation of the existing laws of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky.

If the request is to a lodge in a Sister Jurisdiction, said request shall be sent through the Grand Secretary's Office. SECTION 140. Forfeiture of Election for Initiation. If a candidate shall have had due notice of his election, and of the time and place when and where he could receive the first degree, but shall fail for a period of six months thereafter to present himself to receive it, his el ection shall be void, unless the lodge shall declare the reason for such failure to be good and sufficient. In the latter case the time may be extended for six months; after that lie must again petition and be balloted for as in the first instance.

AID, ASSIST 3. Obligation To Aid When. The obligation to aid and assist extends only to \"Worthy Brothers, their wives, widows and orphans\". A worthy brother is one who is or who died in good standing. If he be suspended, it matters not from what cause, our obligation toward him ceases until he shall regain his good standing; and if he dies without having done so, that is the misfortune of himself and his family, and not the fault of the Fraternity. A lodge has the right to extend charity to the family of a suspended Mason, but is not under obli gation to do so. 4. Request for Aid, Conditions, Penalty. All solicitations for aid, not addressed to the lodge to which the applicant belongs, or to members thereof, that do not bear the approval of the Grand Master, are forbidden.

Aid to Church or Other Objects. A letter, circular, or other printed or written matter, app ealing to Masons, without approval of the Grand Master, to contribute to or solicit for a church, political campaign or other object, either personally or requesting that it be read in lodge, and containing official statement that the signers are Masons, i s a violation of Masonic Law. APPEAL 9. Non - members Can Not. A non - member cannot appeal from the action of a lodge rejecting him. 10. Decision of Grand Master Holds Interim. A brother can take an appeal to the Grand Lodge from the decision of the Grand Master; but pending the time intervening the hearing of this appeal, the mandate of the Grand Master must be obeyed. ASSESSMENT 11. Home Assessment Inalienable. A lodge has the right to remit dues, but shall not by such remission relieve itself from liab ility to pay the Grand Lodge dues and assessments. These funds are inalienable."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"12. Refusal to Pay Assessments. Any member of a subordinate lodge, including \"free members,\" except those recognized by the Grand Lodge, may be suspended for failing or refusin g to pay any assessments lawfully ordered by the Grand Lodge (Constitution, Sec. 160), the same as for dues. 13. Remission of Dues Does Not Remit Assessments. The remission of dues by the Grand Lodge does not carry with it a remission of assessments. BALLOT 14. Ballot at Called Communication. The constitutional prohibition of balloting at called communications refers to such voting as can only be done by ballot, and not to expressing the sense of the lodge in that way on questions that may lawfully b e determined by viva voice vote. 15. Election by a single Ballot. In case there be but one nomination for any office, it would be within the usage and constitutional provision to entertain a motion that the Secretary (or a person named) be requested to ca st a ballot on behalf of the lodge for the nominee, but the vote for such action must be unanimous. BENEFITS 16. Benefit System Unmasonic. A benefit system and/or entitlements are antagonistic to the principles and spirit of Masonry. 17. Retirement Bene fits (1).

M., shall be managed by the 'Retirement Committee\" composed of the Grand Master, Chairman; the Deputy Grand Master and the Finance Committee. (2). ELIGIBILITY FOR RET IREMENT.

If any of the provisions of this regulation are not in conformity with The Employee Retirement Insuranc e Security Act of 1974, then the provisions of said act shall prevail with respect to the non - conforming portions of the regulations. BOOKS 18. Improper Books Prohibited - Penalty for Using. The use of improper and unauthorized books is unlawful and pernicious in its influence. Only such books as are authorized by Grand Lodge (e.g. Trestle - Board by H. B; Grant, The Kentucky Monitor , by Henry Pirtle; Th Ky Rtl ; and The Kentucky Ritual ) are acceptable for use by its members.(2006) BY - LAWS 19. Change of By - Laws by Committee. It is not within the province of the Grand Lodge Committee on By - Laws to require any change of a lodge by - law that does not conflict with some law, rule or regulation of the Grand Lodge. 20. By - Laws - When Declared Void . A Master of a lodge cannot lawfully declare a by - law or set of by - laws null and void after the same has been approved by the Grand Lodge Committee on By - Laws. CALLED OFF 21. Lodge Closed on Day Opened. A lodge cannot \"call off' from one day to another, but must be closed on the same day of its opening. 22. May Call Off and Open Any Degree, but Must Close it. A lodge duly opened on any degree can call from labor to refreshment and open in any other degree, but the lodge must be closed on each degree in which it opens. If the lodge be opened on the Master Mason degree and then closed, it cannot thereafter be opened on the same day for the purpose of confer - ring either the Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft Degree. CHARTER 23. Substitute for Charter Lost or Destroyed. A lodge holding a certificate of its legal authority to work, in lieu of its lost or destroyed charter, is still considered a chartered lodge and possesses all the rights and privileges of such. 24. Last Charter Valid Old One returned or Ar rest Follows. If a new charter be granted to a lodge because the old one is reported to have been lost, such action shall be equivalent to a cancellation of the old charter and render it void and of no value. In case the old charter shall subsequently be f ound, the Master of such lodge shall immediately return it to the Grand Secretary. On his failure or refusal to do so, the Grand Master shall arrest the charter and cite the lodge to appear at the next communication of the Grand Lodge, and show cause why i ts charter shall not be revoked. Provided however, upon written request the Grand Lodge may permit a lodge to retain its original or"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"duplicate charter for historical purposes upon their surrendering same to the Grand Secretary for endorsement as a historic al document and not an active charter. 25. Work In absence of Charter Illegal Exception. Work done in the absence of the charter, or its equivalent certificate, is illegal, except at funerals, when the actual presence of the charter is not required. For t he purpose of conducting funeral services an emergent communication of any lodge may be called at any suitable place within its jurisdiction; pro - vided that when a lodge is so opened and closed at a place other than the regular communication place of the l odge, the officer presiding shall make full report to the Secretary for inclusion in the minutes of the next stated communication. 26. Presence of Charter. If the charter is in the preparation or ante - room of the lodge, it is present for all practical pur poses. 27. Duty of Custodian of Charter. The Master of a Masonic lodge is the custodian of its charter and cannot delegate that authority to another. Upon him is laid the responsibility of its care, and to him the Grand Lodge looks for its preservation. As a lodge cannot be opened in the absence of its charter, it is the duty of its Master to always have that instrument in the lodge or ante - room at all communications of the lodge. 28. Revocation of Charter. A charter can only be revoked by the Grand Lodge granting it, and a lodge can be permanently deprived of its charter only after being cited to show cause why it should not be done. 29. New Charter to Old Lodge. The charter of a lodge destroyed and a new one granted within a year thereafter, naming the o riginal officers of the lodge, is to all intents and purposes the same lodge under the old charter. It had not ceased to exist, only the convenient, tangible evidence of its authority to work was for a time wanting. The new charter restored authority, and no other formality is required. The officers are not to be re - installed. LODGE COMMITTEES 30. Committee on Investigation. The Committee on Investigation should inquire into everything affecting the qualifications of a candidate; whether he is in possessi on of his physical and intellectual faculties, possess a good reputation in his community, and whether the lodge has jurisdiction over him. 31. Report of Committee on Investigation. When a Committee on Investigation reports upon the worthiness or unworthi ness of a candidate, the lodge has no right to compel it to say in what way it came to its conclusion. The report is simply the opinion of the committee. 32. Reports Prejudicial to Character of a Brother. Reports prejudicial to the character of a brother being in circulation, it is the duty of his lodge to investigate them, whether the brother requests an investigation or not. A petition of a brother to have charges injurious to his character investigated by his lodge should most certainly be granted, and the committee should, in justice to him, make a thorough investigation and report to the lodge. DEGREES 33. Out of Time Penalty. Should any subordinate lodge confer any of the degrees of Masonry out of time, and in violation of the Constitution of the Gr and Lodge, the charter of said lodge may be arrested by the Grand Master. 34. Degrees at Called Communication. The degrees may be conferred at a called communication. 35. Degrees By A Suspended Master Mason. A degree conferred by a suspended Master Mason is illegal, and the brother receiving it must be \"healed\" by his lodge. A Master Mason is guilty of gross unmasonic con - duct in entering a lodge and conferring a degree, if he knew he was suspend ed at the time, and any brother who knew him to be under suspension, if present and consenting thereto, is equally guilty."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"36. Monitorial Parts of Degrees. While parts of the degrees are monitorial, it is highly improper to exemplify the monitorial parts in public. DEMIT, DEMITTED 37. Demit to the Unworthy. A lodge should not grant a demit to one known to be unworthy, but should immediately prefer charges against such brother. For knowingly issuing a demit to such unworthy person, a lodge is subject to ha ve its charter arrested. 38. To Remit Dues and Grand Demit. A lodge has the right to remit the dues of a suspended member, restore him to membership, subject to the provisions of Sections 187 & 188 of the Constitution, and grant him a demit. 39. Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft Demitting. An Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft having demitted. and being a resident of a jurisdiction where such demits are not recognized. may by consent of the lodge having jurisdiction, and regular petition to and ballot of any Kentucky lodge, be elected to membership therein, and it may then request some lodge where he resides to confer the remaining degree, or degrees, upon him. Or the Kentucky lodge may surrender any jurisdiction it may be presumed to possess, in order to quiet all possible claims upon the candidate. IMPOSTORS 40. Impostors Reported When. It is the duty of the Secretary of all Subordinate Lodges to immediately report soliciting donation to the Grand Secretary. The fact that a person representing himself to be a member of the Fraternity. when in fact he is not, giving his name and the name of lodge to which he reports himself as belonging, and such other description of him as may be necessary to identify him. MASONRY OR FREEMASONRY 41. Masonry is Non - Sectarian, Non - Political, and must remain so. The avoidance of political subjects in the lodge room is a cardinal principle of Masonry, and a Mason must not use his lodge connection to further his political ambition. We are taught, among the first lessons in Masonry, that it unites, upon the principle of brotherly love, men of every country, sect and opinion. Our ancient brethren wisely determined that no political or religious distinctions should ever limit its charity. It is peculiar to no country, but common to all. It recognizes no religion but that unaltering trust in God, who created the world and all things therein - The Grand Architect of the Universe - by whose unerring square the blocks we offer must at last be tried, and who wil l reward us according to our merits. MASTER 42. Title. The principal officer of a lodge is Master, not Worshipful Master. The prefix \"Worshipful\" is a title of respect, given him by others, and not the name of his office. It is improper for the Master to sign his name \"A.B., Worshipful Master.' It should be, \"A.B., Master.\" 43. Who is \"The Master\"? The one acting as Master is clothed with the power and held to the same accountability as the regularly installed Master of the lodge - during the time he is lawfully acting as Master, and no longer. 44. Re - election of a Master Many Times. The Constitution does not prohibit the re - election of a Master every year during his life, but serving as Master of a lodge for many years is a reflection on the lodge and o n the Master himself - not a matter to boast of. If one be a capable Master, he will so instruct his Wardens and members that there will be more than one who is \"worthy and well qualified\" to take his place. To retain one in office and keep competent brethre n from the gratification of a laudable ambition, neutralizes a proper incentive for the members to make efforts to become proficient in Masonic work and methods by placing the reward beyond their hope."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"45. Who Should Not Be Chosen Master. No lodge should elect any brother, either as Master or Warden, unless he manifest such care and zeal for Masonry as to induce the belief that he can and will qualify him - self to preside according to the laws and usages of Masonry. 46. Objection to Installing the Master. If a brother wishes to prevent the installation of the Master - elect, he must do so at the proper time and in the proper place, which is in the lodge when the installing officer is about to install him; and the reasons for objecting must be in writing and be valid ones. In the absence of objection or charges, a brother elected Master (if otherwise eligible) is entitled to be installed. 47. When Installed, the Master's Authority is Complete. When installed, the Master's authority to preside over the lodge i s complete, and his acts, within the scope of that authority, are binding. 48. The Master Habitually Absent from Lodge. A Master of a Masonic lodge cannot habitually absent himself from the communications of his lodge without violation of his oath of offi ce, and by doing so he lays him - self open to censure, and becomes liable to suspension by the Grand Master. 49. Master Requires Lodge to Obey Grand Master - When. The Master should require his lodge to obey the mandate of the Grand Master; refusal of its me mbers to submit to his decisions until reversed by the Grand Lodge is revolutionary, and subjects the offenders to punishment for unmasonic conduct. 50. Master Signs Minutes. The Master must sign the minutes immediately after the same shall have been approved by the lodge. 51. Master Cannot Be Suspended for Non - Payment. The Master can - not be suspended during his term of office for non - payment of dues or other offenses, except as p rovided in Sections 180 to 183 of the Constitution. 52. Master Pro Tem. Drawing Warrants. A Master pro tem should not draw a warrant for money appropriated by the lodge, except while he is lawfully acting in such capacity. MASTER MASON 53. Master Mason Entitled to Full Benefits. A member of the fraternity, to receive the full benefits of the Order, viz: the right to attend the lodge in all the degrees, to vote upon petitions, to vote for officers, to hold office, to sit i n the Grand Lodge, must be an aff iliated Master Mason. PAST MASTERS 54. Past Master and Past Grand Master Defined. A Past Grand Master, or Past Master is one who has been regularly elected and installed as a Grand Master or Master of a Grand Lodge or a symbolic Lodge of Master Masons an d served for the term for which he was elected. If he dies while in office, he shall be deemed to have served his term, and shall be listed as a Past Grand Master or Past Master. TEMPORARY PRESIDING OFFICER 55. Any Master Mason May Be Called To The Chair - When. The Master, Senior Warden or Junior Warden, when presiding over a lodge, has the right to call any Master Mason to the chair and his acts are legal; provided the one so calling him to preside remains in the lodge room. 56. Past Masters Qualificatio n to Preside. A Past Master, to have the right (under the Const., Sec. 112) to open and preside over a lodge in the absence of the Master and Wardens, must be a Past Master of the same lodge over which he is to preside. RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"1. Power to Lay Cornerston es or Dedicate Halls. Subject to the approval of the Grand Lodge or Grand Master, a lodge may accept an invitation to lay a cornerstone or dedicate a Masonic Hall, church or public building, which work may be performed by the Grand Lodge, or by a sub - ordin ate lodge presided over by the Grand Master or his proxy, who must be an affiliated Master Mason with a Kentucky Lodge. Unless the corner - stone be laid with Masonic ceremony, a Masonic lodge should not attend as a body or in Masonic clothing. 2. Open Ins tallation. The officers of a lodge may be installed in open installation at the discretion of the lodge without a dispensation from the Grand Master. At such installations the Grand Lights to remain in the room but be placed so as to be out of view. Also b rethren are to be careful not to give the signs. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A PPENDIX A. Home Life Membership Certificates The Masonic Widows and Orphans Home and Infirmary, was incorporated as a charitable institution by act of the Kentucky legislature on January 15, 1867. It has continued its corporate existence since that date al - though its Articles of Incorporation have been amended and restated from time to time. The Old Masons' Home of Kentucky was incorporated as a charitable institution by the Commonwealth of Kentucky on October 25, 1901. Like the Masonic Widows and Orphans' Home and Infirmary, it too has continued its corporate existence since that date, although its Articles of Incorporation have been amended and restated from time to time. On February 12, 1993, the Masonic Widows and Orphans' H ome and Infirmary and the Old Masons Home of Kentucky agreed on a plan of Merger, and on September 1, 1993 was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky as the Masonic Homes of Kentucky, Inc. From its inception, the corporation has been controlled by i ts voting life members who elect the Board of Directors of the corporation. With the passage of time and the change in our tax laws, the corporation has further evolved into a public charity qualified under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code which qualifies contributions made to the Homes as tax deductible for federal and state income tax purposes. As a public charity, the operation of the Homes are subject to state and federal law and regulations. The Masonic Homes of Kentucky. Inc.. are a n on - stock, non - profit corporation. No part of the income of which can inure to the benefit of any member, director, or officer of the Homes or to any private individual organization or association not qualified under Sec. 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under dissolution, the assets and property of the Home must be conveyed or distributed to some other similar organization qualified under the same Internal Revenue Code section. While Kentucky Masons as certificate holders elect the directors of th e Homes, the Board of Directors has the legal authority and responsibility to oversee its affairs and operations. The corporation is a separate legal entity and subject to the internal revenue code and regulations en - acted thereunder. This law requires tha t all funds, gifts, bequests, and devices must be used for the charitable purposes expressed in the Homes corporate charter. No part of its income or property can inure to the benefit of any individual or for any non - charitable purposes including fraternal purposes. For this reason, the operations of the Homes are required to be conducted independently of the fraternity. Admissions to the Homes and its policies and operations are deter - mined by its Board of Directors through the power of the Board to adopt by - laws and make decisions at Board meetings for the government of the corporation. Kentucky Masons may become life members of the corporation through the purchase of life membership certificates for $150 each. Kentucky Lod ges acquire Lodge Memberships through direct purchase and through the cumulative effect of each brother paying an annual Homes' assessment, the benefit of which accrues to the member's subordinate lodge. Each Life or Lodge Membership certificate entitles the holder thereof to cast one vote per certificate in the election of directors to its Board. It is the process that has existed since the inception of the Homes that ensures that control over the corporation shall reside with the Master or other represen tative of such subordinate lodge of Kentucky at the annual meeting of the corporation. When two or more lodges consolidate, the Lodge Membership certificate passes to the consolidated lodges. B. Cowles Benevolent Fund"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Whereas, Brother John H.

In 1933 the report of the Committee on Finance was adopted whereby the Grand Treasurer, with the advice and approval of the Grand Master, was authorized to enter into a contract with a good and solvent corporation to act as trustee for the fund and that the expense thereof, if any, be paid by the Grand Treasurer so that the gross income will remain intact in said fund.

Said assessment to be paid to the Grand Secretary in the same manner as those noted above. (1998) E. Freemasonry and Religion Basic Principles. Freemasonry is not a religion, nor is it a substitute for religion. It requires of its members a belief in God as part of the obligation of every responsible adult, but advocates no sectarian faith or practice. Masonic ceremonies include prayers, both traditional and extempore, to reaffirm each individual's dependence on God and to seek divine guidance. Freemasonry is open to men of any faith, but religion may not be discussed at Masonic meetings. The Supreme Being. Masons believe that there is one God and that people employ many different ways to seek, and to express what they know of, God. Masonry primarily uses the appellation, \"Grand Architect of the Universe\", and other non - sectarian titles, to address Deity. In this way, re1sons of different faiths may join toget her in prayer, concentrating on Go (l, rather than differences among themselves. Masonry believes in religious freedom and that the relationship between the individual and God is personal, private and sacred. Volume of the Sacred Law. An open volume of the Sacred Law, \"The rule and guide of life,\" is an essential part of every Masonic meeting. The Volume of the Sacred Law in the Judeo/Christian tradition is the Bible; to Freemasons of' other faiths, it is the book held holy by them. (2000)"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Oath of Fre emasonry. The obligations taken by Freemasons are sworn on the Volume of the Sacred Law. They are undertakings to follow the principles of Freemasonry and to keep confidential a Freemason s means of recognition. The much discussed \"penalties\", judicial rem nants from an earlier era, are symbolic, not literal. They refer only to the pain any honest man should feel at the thought of violating his word. Freemasonry Compared with Religion. Freemasonry lacks the basic elements of religion: (a) It has no dogma or theology, no wish or means to enforce religious orthodoxy. (b) It offers no sacraments. (c) It does not claim to lead to salvation by works, by secret knowledge, or by any other means. The secrets of Freemasonry are concerned with modes of recognition, not with the means of salvation. Freemasonry Supports Religion. Freemasonry is far from indifferent toward religion. Without interfering in religious practice, it expects each member to follow his own faith and to place his Duty to God above all other duties. Its moral teachings are acceptable to all religions. F. Lodge of Research - How to Establish (1) Twenty - five or more Master Masons, members in good standing of any Kentucky lodge or lodges, may petition the Grand m aster for, and he may in his discretion issue, without fees and without compliance with the usual requirements prescribed for the issuance of a Dispensation under the Constitution, a Dispensation to such members to form a Lodge of Re - search. And a Charter may be issued, without a fee, to such a Lodge of Research upon approval by the Grand Lodge at an annual communication; also, without compliance with the usual requirements prescribed for the issuance of a Charter. The territorial jurisdiction of such Lodg e of Research when formed shall be co - extensive with the territorial jurisdiction of this Grand Lodge. The membership shall consist of the Charter Members thereof and those Master Masons of Kentucky lodges who are later admitted by affiliation or in accor dance with by - laws adopted by it. Lodges of Research shall not be numbered. A lodge formed hereunder may elect to honorary, contributing, or subscribing membership Master Masons in good standing in this or any other Grand Jurisdiction in Masonic affiliati on with this Grand Lodge under such conditions as by its by - laws may be prescribed, which by - laws shall limit the power to vote to members belonging to Kentucky lodges only.
