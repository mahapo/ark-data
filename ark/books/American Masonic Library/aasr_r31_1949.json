Tsnx DEVELOPME~qT 05’ RITUAL 1. It is difficult to trace the origin and development of the Ritual of the Thirty-first Degree for the following reasons: (a) There was no degree which, in any way, resembled the 310 in the RITE OF PERFECTION of t~venty five degrees which dates froii, the Council of lfmperors of the Rost and I Vest iii 1758. These French degrees wnre conserved, iii essence, in Inunuseript ritoals of L Henry Andre~v Franeken (iii English), 1783. ‘l’wonty of those numb were accepted, with mno’lifie,itmons, by the Ancient nid Ar e,, 1 .i~,? 3’’’’ttisl, Ituhi’ ii, iSOl ‘lie 2l~ ii hl,~, It,?,, ol 1’,’rf,,, i no, nun L prototype of the s2 0 . ‘rmierc is no bueluground for the ~110. (h) in the Jim in Soactnaire by I)oszedardski (1805-1809). there is a referenee to the 310 under the title Le Prai .Afa~on, but there is no ritual text and tIe sctting, in~’estitnrr :uid secret ~ ork gire no suggestion of tIm Inter 310. [ (c) As of 1949, noUiiiig is kiiowi, of Itie ex:ict text of tin’ :100, 310 and 320 adoptod in 1801 In’ the first Supreme Council at Charleston, South Caroliiua, es.cept as the hO 0 and 320 ivere mdii - enced by the 24 and fl50 of the Rite of Perfection. For many years, these three degrees ivere too closely iiiterwoven to be studied separately. They were probubly conferred as a unit and in the form of a brtef lecture or catechism, or both. 2. The first ritual of the Thuurty’first Degree is found in the L :ritten or compiled between thie years 1845-1860. ‘1’lie 30, 330 manuscript rituals of Killian II. Van Rensselaer, :130, which wore were eoosidered as a unit, and the ten pages which inelmude the basic ideas of the degree of Grand Inspector Inquisitor Coin. mandar are within the framework of the 320. 3 On January 5, 3859, Albert Pike, 330, Sovereign Grand t”on,mai~u1er of the Soiiiliern Suprome Cc,un,-il lion, 1859 to IHil Grand Inspeotos’ Inquisitor Commander aiinounced thin coiopletioii of separate and distinct rituals of the 300, 310 und 320. lIe took the niore skeleton of ttis early 510 with ~ta einpl.asis 01)00 3ustice and Equity, and clothed it with rich ceremonial and a drama which portrayed the techniques for the training of a Judge. 4. The Pike ritual, with minor changes in 1860, was adopted by the Nortliorii Masonic Jurisdiction in the Union of 1867. Later revisions in 1875, 1904 and 1930 followod the traditional pattern —a synthesis of Van Rensselaer and Pike. in 1938, the Supreme Cousicul authorized a toiitiitive ritniul of the 310 based upon a draniatie trial scene iii an Eligliali Civil Court of the Fourteenth Century. ‘I’hiis was withdrawn iii 1941, but the trial scene was made optional. ‘I~tie ritiiiul of 1949 isolates all forissat Scottish Rite olemoats in a l,ruef ei.’reiimnruiiul n)ioiiiiug and retains the 1938 trial smoite suiiio,vliiut ulirm.tgoil II.

The Judges, while witnesses are giving evidence, will be taking intermittent notes and, at all times, will follow all pro - ceedings with alert interest. 2. When a witness is giving evidence, all the Counsel retained in this case, except the Sergeant (Attorney) actually examining the witness, will take frequent longhand untes. Shufihing of papers and searching for references add te the atmosphere of realism. 3. Witnesses and partisans of the Plaintiff and Defendant should maintain a keen interest and, occasionally, indulge in whis - pered and more audible coinuients. Their expressions will display iLppropriate reactions to any significant statement or admission. 4. The Court Usher, Herald, Captain of the Guard and Warder affect no interest, except when they are called upon for actiOa. 5. Comedy. within the limits of good taste, is sanctioned.

I taught obedience to the laws and decrees of the people of Athens, and the Council of Five Hundred. And when, by an unjust judgment, I was condemned to demtth, I refused to flee lest I should hrmng the law into disrepute.
