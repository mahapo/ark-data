This resulted in the published History of the Royal Order of Jesters, National Court, dated January 1, 1968. “Mirth is King” Royal Director Wriliam S. Broti’n stated the following at the First Annual Meeting of the Royal Order of Jesters The motto of our Order “Miith is King” explains to the world in a large ineasute the purpose of our existence. There has always been plenty of heartache and misery in the world, and we know that the best philosophy is not to biood over sorrows, but to forget them as fai as possible. It is the duty of every Jestet to promote cheer ann happiness, not only among members, but evetywhete he can carry his sunshine, and it is ust to this extent that the Jester organization must be taken ser - iously. We can do a lot of good in this old world, if we make but a slight effort and always remember that good cheer and laughter are unfailing as antidotes. 6 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS Shortly after Imperial Potentate Fred A Hines was elected in New Orleans, April 13, 1910, and until August of the same year, Noble James S. MeCandless, Chief Rabban of Aloha Temple, Honolulu, continued to urge him by letter, telegram, and in person to fix a definite date for a visitation of the Imperial Council to Aloha Temple and the I Iawaiian Islands. Consequently in August, 1910, Noble MeCandless with Past Illustrious Potentate George Filmer of Islam Temple, San Francisco met with the Imperial Potentate at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco and decided upon the period of February 15 to March 7, 1911 as the time of the Imperial Visttation to Aloha Temple. Noble Filmer agieed to act for the Imperial Potentate and was designated by Aloha Temple to act for them in all matters pertaining to the pilgrimage. At the personal solicitation of Noble James S MeCandless, the new and palatial steamer “Wilhelmina” of the Matson Navigation Com - pany was chartered for the trip with Noble Petei Johnson of Aloha Temple as her commander. Noble A M Allison of Islam Temple, San Francisco, was appointed historian of the pilgrimage. The “Wilbelmina’ sailed from Pier 38 in San Francisco on February 15, 1911, with Captain Johnson and 127 persons’ 69 Shriners, including Imperial Sir Fred A Hines, Frederick R Smith, Imperial Oiiental Guide, William S. Brown, Imperial Treasurer, Past Imperial Potentate George H Gteen, and Past Imperial Potentate Lou B. Wiosni, wives, children, and relatives. On the voyage over, George Filmer and a number of Nobles, to - gether with Captain Johnson, arranged many games and sports to while away the hours. Historian Allison provides the following information “On the third day out of San Francisco (Feb. 1811, there were some who danced the evening through, others at the bridge and xvhist tables, but not until midnight did the meeting of the Jesters take place in the smoker, which lasted until 3 a m. Noble Peter Johnson, skipper being proclaimed a Royal Jestet, toyed with Dr. Frederick Smith, D. E. Perkins, J. B. Leggat, William M Beamish, and A. M. Allason. At the close of the meeting Chief Jester Johnson donated the fees receix’ed to the games com - mittee.” We know the idea occurred to Historian A. M Allison to start a new order to be known as the “Royal Order of Jesters,” and this was suggested to Noble George Filmer, who enthusiastically approved of the idea. Noble Allison personally prepared the Ritual ot Book of the Play, and arranged all details of the first initiations. 9 S.S.

On page 15 of the Proceedings of the fifth Annual Meeting of the Royal Order of Jesters in San Francisco, Jester James S. MeCandless, of Honolulu, said. “As you know they usually get up some little or - ganization or some stunt to have a little amusement and they conceived the idea of the Royal Order oF Jesters. Billy Brown always enters into the spirit of anything that is good, and when they arrived in Honolulu they had already committeed the ritual of the Jesters. Hawaii at that time being under royalty, of course it had to be the Royal Jesters. Don’t forget that, boys, you belong to the royal family. So when they got down there they initiated quite a number of us in the islands, among them myself.” He makes no specific mention as to who or how many were initiated.

Everything being now complete and the stage set, the Acts were played out before two Nobles, Nelson Lewis of Nile Temple, Seattle, Washington, and James A. Sorenson of Islam Temple, San Francisco, who fully appreciated the performance, criticized at will, caught their cues, sang the roles in fairly good style, and learned the lines well. The fun was genteel, excruciating, and enjoyed by the candidates as much as by the Ccuit itself. As the play of the Royal Order of Jesters had been well accepted and interest in the secret performance aboard ship was becoming so general, another performance was called for midnight of the same day in the Social Hall of the Wilhelmina. Promptly at midnight the follow- ing nine Nobles were inducted into the mysteries. Each learned his lines and cues and played well his part. August F. Sehleicher Esten A. Fletcher H. S.

The fun was immense, the comedy good, and the laughter awakened sleepers in neaiby staterooms and aroused the interest of many of the nobility aboard. Promptly at midnight, on March 3, 1911, another class of nine amateurs who thought they could act, presented themselves at the Stage Door and applied for admission to the Royal Order of Jesters.

(Bill) Allison aboard the S.S. Wilbelmina, enroute to the Hawaiian Islands At the First Annual Meeting of the Royal Order of Jesters, adjourned to French Lick Springs, Indiana, September 3, 1918, the Ritual committee requested that the subject he opened up for general discussion by the representatives and members present. It was the recommendation of the Ritual Committee that they be given further time to consider it and that a competent Jester be secured to formulate a Ritual to be pre - sented at the next annual meeting. At the Second Annual Meeting of the National Court held in Indianapolis on June 8, 1919, the Ritual Committee reported that while progress had been made in revising the Ritual, it was still not in such shape to present to the meeting When completed it would be submitted to the Royal Impresario who would submit copies to each subordinate Court for review. It would then be presented at the 1920 annual meeting. At the Third Annual Meeting of the Royal Order of Jesters, held in Portland, Oregon on June 20, 1920, Jester George Filmer stated that the committee went over the proposed Ritual and were unanrmous in suggesting it be adopted They desired that the Creed of a Jester, written by William S Brown, be included. After the Royal Director had called for comments and objections, and hearing none, Jester E. A. Fletcher moved the adoption of the report which was seconded by Jester James C. McCandless and carried. The revision and rewriting of the Ritual was done by Jester Eugene L. Connelly, of Pittsburgh Court No. 2. At the Fourth Annual Meeting, held in Des Moines, Iowa, June 12, 1921, the Ritual Committee reported that changes and new parts had been submitted to the committee for inclusion in the Ritual. The committee was most appreciative. It was then proposed to adopt them as a part of the perfected ritual. The Book of the Play had been revised from the original at the second, third, tenth, and eleventh annual meet - ings. The present Book of the Play was rewritten and adopted at the eleventh annual meeting rn Miami in 1928. It has a new lineup of offi - cers and cast more in conformity with the theatrical profession whose titles we assumed. William S. Brown is given credit for the “Creed of a Jester” and the “Toast to Goodfellowshrp ‘~“The Fool’s Prayer” was written by Ed - ward Royland Sill, as “The Soul of a Royal Jester”. At the close of the Third Annual Meeting Jester J L Pease of Oakland suggested to Royal Director Brown that Sill’s pocin be given at the close of the meeting. At the conclusion of the Fourth Annrral Meeting of the Royal Order of Jesters, Royal Director William Brown read the Fool’s Prayer.

Royal Impresario Washburn announced ~rt the Third Annual Meet - ing, held in Portland, that he hadl brought with him the National Court Officers jewels and that he had received a set rif the Constitutional Offi - cers jewels. Commenting on the general membership jewels, he reported the hrst shipment had been received in April, 1920, but due to the poor quality of the black ribbon used he had sent them back, requesting that they furnish them with purple ribbons of the same quality as used on the National Court jewels. Had the black ribbon been of acceptable quality one must assume that today general membership jewels would be suspended by a black ribbon. Royal Director Brown commented on the general membership jewel as follows: “The badge (jeweL is an interrogation mark, which means that probably some of you have not practiced and carried out. When asked the meaning of the little emblem he carries, it is an interro - gatron. The answer should be given in all Courts with simply your fingers, and the lips in silence. That is your answer. What does the badge mean~ An interrogation mark, as you will probably notice on the badge.” The jewels remained the same until the 59th Annual l\\’Ieetrng held in Kansas City on July 5, 1976 At this time the Regalia Committee sub - mitted the following report Your Regalia Committee is pleased to report the following. This is in five parts. I. That there has been submitted to the Committee recommenda - tions for the approval and adoption of a new forni of member - ship jewel The center portion of the same design, proportion, symbols and colors as the membership jewel heretofore approved and in general use 2. That the Committee recommends that the only approved form of suspension for all jewels of members and officers of the order shall be the purple ribbon 3. That the Committee recommends that there be no adornment suspended or worn with the member or ofircer’s jewel of the order other than the appropi etc bars designating the office held or an office which had been held in the past or the designation of the number of years of membership of the member or an appropriate bar indicating that the wearer is an Emeritus mem - ber of the National Court. 4. The Committee recommends that the purple beret be recognized as the official headgear of all Officers of the National Court and Past Royal Directors of the Royal Order of Jesters. 5. That the Committee recommends that, in addition to the jewels of their respective officers, ?he folloxving insignia be recognized and approved: A. for each of the officers of the National Court other than the Royal Director, three gold Billikens, B.

One was designed and executed by William C. Etzel, Impresario of Cleveland Court No. 14, for the exclusive use by the Royal Order of Jesters and the members of all subor - dinate Courts. It was accepted by the National Court as the official “Coat of Arms” and a copyright was obtained from the United States Copyright Office for its protection. This copyright is now owned by the National Court. “What the Hell’s a Royal Jester?” THE ROYAL ORDER OF JESTERS From Medieval times until the seventeenth century licensed fools, or jesters, were commonly kept at court and frequently in the retinue of wealthy nobles They played an important part in the spread of litera - ture and education. Some of the most celebrated English Court Jesters were Archie Armstrong in the court of James I, Patch, the court jester of Elizabeth, wife of Henry VII, and Will Sommers Henry VIII’s jester. The French court also had its jesters, Triboulet was the jester of Louis XII and Francis I, 1487-1536. There apparently was some sort of a Jester order among the Monks, For Jester George F. Foye, of Oak - land Court No. 6, while travelling in the Far East obtained a bejeweled dagger inscribed “Royal Jesters”. The monk from whom he obtained it stated it was of ancient origin and very valuable Jester Foye presented it to Royal Director Brown. A Royal Officer has given us a photograph of a poster dated FeW ruary 11, 1870 It is in the form of a Proclamation by the “King of J esters” and orders “all long faces, never smiles, and various other mala - dies, all of which are curable by the application of our Sovereign Balsam, Good Humor, to appear in the Court of Momus, to be holden in our Palace of Mirth, at the Prince of Wales Music Hall.” At least we are a perpetuation of that Order in spirit, standing for Fun, Laughter and Mirth. The name Royal Order of Jesters is obviously not original with us. Our interest is how and why it was chosen, The Hawaiian Islands had long been under a monarchy. The last king was David Kalakaua Rex, crowned king on February 12, 1883. He was a Noble of Islam Temple and died in the Palace Hotel in San Francisco on January 20, 1891. In 1891 on January 29, his sister, Qdreen Lrlruokalanr was proclaimed Queen. In 1895 she formally abdicated renouncing all claims to the throne. On June 16, 1897 Flawair was annexed to the United States and became the Territory of Hawaii. On a Monday afternoon, February 27, 1911 members of the Shrine Pilgrimage were given a reception by ex - Queen Lrlruokalanr at her residence It is my belief that the name of our order, Royal Order of Jesters, originates with the 1911 visitation to the Hawaiian Islands, long ruled by kings and queens Jester James MeCandless, of Aloha Court No. 1, appears to confirm this by the following statement made at the fifth Annual Meeting. “They conceived the idea of tIre Royal Jesters Hawaii at that time being under royalty, of course it had to be the Royal Order of Jesters Don’t forget that, boys, you belong to the royal family” 30 31"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"“He is King Momus, the King of Mirth” THE ORIGIN OF THE BILLIKEN The Billrken is the emblem of the Royal Order of Jesters. The Billiken was patented October 6, 1908. by Florence Pretz, of Kansas City, Missouri as a new “Design Image” Patent No. D 39, 603 called “A Billiken.” It was manufactured as an iron corn hank, a statuette, and a doll, and it was pictured on postcards, mugs, plates and spoons. The American Doll and Toy Company is said to have produced over 200,000 Billiken dolls which were the rage for six or seven months. James Unreume, P.D of Aloha Court No 1, in an article on the A c~OHA Billiken in 1966 states. Miss Pretz placed on the base of the statuette the slogan, “The God of Things as they ought to Be”, a paraphrase of Kipling’s famous words from “Lenvor”. “Shall draw the things as he sees it for the God of Things as they are”. The post cards carried the verse: I am the God of Happiness I simply make you smile I prove that life’s worth living And that everything’s worth while, I force the failure to his fc’et And make the growler grin, I am the God of Happiness My name is Billiken. The Billrken grew to be regarded as an emblem, or symbol, of good luck. It was chosen as the mascot, or good luck symbol for the Imperial Pilgrimage to Honolulu in 1911, aboard the SS Wrlhelmina. Historian Allison, writing of the Pilgrimage states “Then it was reported that the Brlliken had been studiously pouring over a list of names during the afternoon and Captain Johnson commanded him to come forth and read what was written there”. It turned out to be nicknames and puns for the Nobility assembled. Historian Allison also notes that on the occasion of the official ban - quet given to Imperial Sir Hines, on the last evening in Honolulu, before sailing back to San Francisco “Upon the walls were draped Shrine banners and a grinning Billiken, the mascot of the pilgrimage, beamed upon all comers before the central mirror.” It is no wonder The Bilirken—Our Mascot that Noble Allison adopted the Billiken for the Royal Order of Jesters, it being regarded as a symbol of happiness, joy, and good luck.

A magazine article published in the September, 1966 issue of the Alaska Sportsman, by Dorothy Jean Ray unraveled more about the Billiken. On a visit to Seattle’s Ye Old Curiosity Shop she discovered a big gray east iron Billi - ken coin bank, on the back of which was the patent number D-~9603. Previous thinking was that the Billiken originated with the Alaska Eskimos, as they had been carving them prior to 1913 However the Billiken was intioduced into Alaska by a storekeeper on Dromere Island. He gave a statuette to an Eskimo, Angokwaghuk, nicknamed “Happy Jack”, one of the most famous Eskimo ivory carvers. He carved Billikens ,rnd they became very popular with the natives, as well as others, as good luck charms.

One of the most active Shriners was Noble Allison. He was elected the first Scribe upon the formation of Bamboo Oasis Shrine Club. The meeting was held June 20, 1903 in Manila with thirty Shriners becom - ing members including Captain John J. Pershing of Sesostris Temple.
