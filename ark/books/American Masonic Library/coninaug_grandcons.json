By the former, these vows were soon disregarded, and the Order fell into ruin; by the latter they were kept; arid for centuries they ruled thc world. For them, not for the Order of the Temple, the Possesdio Orbis. Becoming Masons, the KADOSHIM divested themselves of the arrogance and luxury, the vices and ambition of dominion and the insubordination which had been the besetting sins of the Order of the Temple and had caused its swift and utter destruction. The Order’s dream of an Oriental Empire, (true cause of the jealousy of the Roman Pontiff), led to no other pomp or pageantry tban those of the scaffold and the stake. The Order passed through the baptism of fire and was purified. The vows of the Kadoshim and the principles of Freemasonry are now in unison.

In no field of intellectual labor are they more necessary; in none can they be more richly rewarded. In no office is there more ample scope for intellect and learning than yours; and in no post could you be more useful to the Brethren. For it is because little instruction is given in the Lodges, because the same lessons and lectures are continually reiterated, and all the doctrine and learning of the Order are neglected, that their meetings become uninteresting, tiresome and unprofitable.
