Not contemning the degrees of the Lodge of Perfection, nor ambitiously seeking to reach with a bound the starry heights of Philosophic and Chivalric Masonry, you have been content to advance with deliberation and regularity. You have wisely thought that the lower bodies of the Rite, constituting the Masonic people, are indispensable to an Order that seeks a real success, and desires to possess the power of benefiting men. You think that the degrees worked in them, offer to a true, a studious and a zealous Mason, large opportunity for the gratification of a laudable ambition. It is in these bodies, naturally more numerous than the higher ones, that the greatest practical service is to be rendered to Masonry. Most honorable, indeed, are the rank and title of “Knight of the East and Sword, and Prince of Jerusalem.” Ignorance sneers at them as high-sounding and absurd; because neither the Profane nor the Masonic ignorance knows the symbolic meaning, nor the glorious historic recol - lections, nor the solemn pledges and obligations that these titles contain."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"14 CONSTiTUTION AND INAUGURATION Ah, Brethren, what a Brotherhood of Masons there would be, if the most of Masons were such men as they should be— “A glorious company, ‘the flower of men “To serve as model for the dozing world, “And be the fair beginning of a time!— Not all;—since everywhere, in every Society, Order, Association. and Church and State. there must be the indolent, the ~selfish, the worthless - and the base, to create and continue the’ necessity for more energetic effort and arouse a resolute persistance, even angry and combative, when heat and anger alone can war successfully against abuses.

It has boasted too much, and performed too little. And if you cduld read the secret thoughts of the mass of Masons, you would find them admitting to themselves, that the secrets and mysteries are merely imaginary, and, except as means of recognition, worth - less; that the mission of the Order is merely mutual material relief and small charities; and that its in - fluences em its members are insignificant, and on society and the world altogether nought. But the secrets and mysteries of Masons continue secrets to the mass, of those who call themselves Masons. The meaning of the symbols was so carefully concealed, in. days of danger and persecution, and perhaps even in safer times, from all but the Adepts, that Masonry itself has forgotten that of many of them. Superficial and therefore false interpretations, given to mislead, came at length to be accepted as the true and only ones; the real solutions of the enigmas being only hinted at, by a .phrase or a word; which, its significance unknown, has been dropped. out of the liturgy and lost; or if retained, now, in the absence of any ~IEdipus, proves an impenetrable veil.

Nevertheless, progress con - tinues to be made; and although the Mason himself who investigates, now has to encounter the difficulties and even the hints to mislead, originally used as precautions against the hostile Profane, discovery after discovery, recently made, warrants us in hoping that after a time the veil of Isis may be wholly raised, when men of intellect and learning, of sagacity and acuteness, shall earnestly engage in the investigation, pursuing the proper paths. The mass of Masons, like the mass of other men, look upon evel’y individual man as an independent unit, laboring, scheming and acquiring wealth, power or knpwledge for himself; and think that he is little interested in the welfare or misfortunes, the happiness or misery, and still less in the virtues or vices of other men. They think that the business of serving the public belongs to those alone whose special trade and vocation it is—the Legislator, the Statesman and the Divine. The idea of a private person benefiting Humanity seems to them chimerical; and that Masonry can do so, they deem a mere pretense or an idle dream. They listen to the recital of the great things which it is in the power of Masonry to do, with incredulity and indifference. The whole is, to them, a play, in which they endure to act their part. To many, the only value of Masonry is, tbat it gives them sounding titles, the meaning of which they ~p I I"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"OF A COUNCIL OF PRINCES OF JERUSALEM. 21 not know, and a distinction which, cheap as it is, they do not deserve. Some are fond of it because it authorizes them to wear brilliant trappings and to decorate themselves with jewels; some, for its pomp and parade; some, because it invests them with a species of power; some, because it enables them to wear mysterious looks, and assume the air of knowing what others cannot know, and to become oracles and bestow their dullness on otbers, because they have been many ye~irs Masons and learned nothing but words and set formulas and phrases. Very many look with a sort of reverence on these formulas, to repeat which accurately is their whole ambition, and to vary from which is to them a removal of all the landmarks at once. If any of these notions were correct, Masonry would be the grossest of deceptions; and it would concern our interest as well as our honor, to abandon it at once and altogether. If it were possible for a man to live for himself alone, his life would be utterly worthless. Many come as near that as they can; but none attain it altogether. All men are copartners in the great business of the world. The worthiest should be the Directors; but all are Share-holders.

Each man imagines himself not part of a greater whole, but a complete whole, with interests that may or may not harmonize with those of all other men. But God has given him the means of knowing the profounder truth, in that instinct and sympathy which impel him to labor for others, even to the point of self-denial and self-sacrifice. We do this in obedience to a power superior to ourselves; as much superior to ourselves as the power which holds the Stars in their orbits is superior to them. From this instinctive desire of laboring for men, for the race, come assbciations of men, and particularly Masonry. Men did not create this Order, merely to aid and relieve ~each other. That feature was added to it at a much later day, and has since become, unfor - tunately, its principal purpose. They created it to benefit their fellow-men. If they had really established it for mutual relief alone, they would still, though unconsciously, have created an instrument to be used for a nobler purpose, and thus have carried out the loftier designs of God. For man can flO more associate with others, and work for himself alone, than the bees can. His instincts and his sympathies forbid it. The unity of the Human race forbids it. A law enacted by God. and yet little understood, holds man and man together—not mechan - ical, nor of self-interest, but a law of attraction, by wbich each clings to the other, as they rest on the earth and wheel with it among the Stars."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"24 CONSTITUTION AND INAUGURATION Thus man fulfills his destiny, only when he labors for others.

What the dead judges of England thought, is still the law for us. We all know that our fate is constantly affected by the acts and words of other men, and theirs by what we do and say; and that not only at death, but during life, what we have done goes to benefit or injure others.

Those entrusted with the conduct of public affairs put all things to such base uses as best serve their own selfish interests. Not only every office has its salary, and many their pickings and stealings; but no act of patriotism is expected to be done without adequate compensation in money. Even the prayers offered up to the Almighty, for the salvation of the State, are purchased with a price.

Wherever one is elected to office by worthy men and without solicitation of suffrages. or cabals or intrigues, he is honored. As the chief or ruler accepts and exercises a trust, delegated to him for the benefit of those whose leader and commander he becomes, so the elector, in casting his vote, exercises a trust delegated to him by God, who might Himself appoint all the rulers of men as He does give the Wisdom, the Virtue and the Energy which fit men to rule and guide, and which the majority of votes cannot give.

As weeds grow without cultivation, so do abuses and corruptions inevitably spring up in free States. They grow up even in Masonry; but here it is not so much active abuses against which we have to contend, as the ever-increasing tendency to lower the standard of duty and the amount of instruction given to the Initiate.

All Truths are from God; and whosoever utters them is inspired, and so far as he has true foresight, a seer and prophet. He who assumes, as speaker or writer, to advise, instruct and guide others, whether in the Lodge or the State, should utter only the oracles of Truth. Neither should he ever hesitate to denounce the false prophets. Jeremiah said unto Hananiah the Prdphet, “The Lord hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie ;“and Elijah brought the Prophets of Baal and of the groves down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. “Both prophet and priest are profane,” the Lord said to Jeremiah, “I ~vill bring evil upon them, I will feed them with worIn~vood, and make them drink the water of oall— b prophets that prophesy lies—prophets of the deceit of their own hearts, that steal my words, every one from his neighbor—that use their tongues, and say, He saith, and cause my people to err by their lies.” Be thou, my Brother, the Apostle of Truth, and wage incessant war against all false prophets, in Masonry and in the State.

Thus man never dies, even on earth, but, like the English Kings, throws the crown and robes to his heirs, as he climbs the skies. No man, however lofty or however huluble, can isolate himself from his kind, and shutting himself’ up in the dark cell of his exclusiveness, determine to live for himself alone.

As to that, oui~ Masonic precept is, “CAoose well—tA en , trust well.” Officers elect and Princes, think not that your Council is less important or less honorable and worshipful, because above it are bodies of higher rank.

Masonry, also, like Humanity, is a unit, and has continuity in itself. It has had a Past, it has a Present, and it will have a Future. Is it to prove false to the promise of its youth, to become weary of its pilgrimage, to submit to the law of decay that brings old age and dotage and death to nations as well as individuals?

At the utmost, they only declare what has already become the law; or, if they do more, merely blunder and work mischief. Every man of any character has some influence over others, and can exert it to benefit the State. The interests of his Order, and his own interests, and those of the State, are identical. For a nation is truly an individual, made one by sympathy and the action of will upon will. It is not a metaphor to say that it has one heart and one soul. For how else could there be epidemics of opinion and passion, agitating a whole people as storms shake a whole ocean? How else could one common feeling and impulse stir and move a nation, and make its multitude of wills become one will, and its action that of a unit? It has its fears, its hopes, its follies, its insanities, its epidemnics of specu - lation and fanaticism, its tears, its visions, its personal trials, its chagrin at defeat, its intoxication in victory. It is cruel and revengeful, or generous and merciful; it is sordid and base, or noble and knightly.

Man dies like the summer flowers; but the root is perennial. The waters flow on to the ocean; but the wells are filled afresh, and the spring is the same, differing from others as before iii its virtues and properties. The nation also has its sleep, its long trance, its dreams, its death. It has its physical characteristics, its peculiar physiognomy, its special mental and intellectual character, which con - tinue unchanged for centuries. It feels, rather than reasons. It changes its habits slowly and adopts new ones reluctantly. Man clings to his errors and idols with sufficient tenacity; but the nation or people with infinitely more. Hence it at first hates reformers, and punishes attempts at reform as crimes. Hence abuses sanctified by time are more tenacious of life than the oaks. Hence Truth makes its way slowly in the popular mind, and an immense force of inertia is always opposed to progress. Remember, therefore, that all reforms and revolu - tions have long roots in the Past, and that the seeds of progress germinate slowly; and do not despondingly conclude that the seed you modestly sow is dead, because the shoot does not speedily appear. And also remember, amid all the discouragenients and disappointments, the provocations and vexatious of life, as well as its toils and troubles and losses and calamities, that death is certain, and the end and term of all these; and that if we should after it be permitted"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"84 OFFICE5 OF INSTALLATION OF A to remember anything of this busy and fretful fever of life, we shall look back with a pitying smile on its tnrmoil and struggles; that there, learning at last to know each other, men will no long be estranged from each other; and that the wretched will then only wonder that they should ever have repined at the griefs, the cares and the disappointments that led them more directly on the road to Heaven.
