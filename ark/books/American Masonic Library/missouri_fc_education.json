As a Fellow Craft, you have symbolically passed from Youth to Manhood, but as yet lack the wisdom that can only come from experience and continued learning. You symbolize man in the prime of life, ready to accept not only the responsibility of your own life, but for your family and society. The themes emphasized in this degree are education and achievement. The more a man learns through the pursuit of knowledge, the more he is capable of achieving. EVOLUTION FROM OPERATiVE TO SPECULATIVE We are unable to accurately pinpoint the time when we went from Operative Masons to Speculative Masons. The change was gradual, and, probably, stretched over a period of more than 50 years. It began early in the 1600’s, and may have begun with the acceptance of patrons into the Operative Lodges. Those who were admitted by consent of the Operative Masons became “Accepted Masons.” Membership was sought after because of the spiritual, social, and cultural advantages available, and this is when our Craft grew rapidly in numbers. The decline of Gothic architecture and the reduced demands for great building projects had greatly lowered the number of skilled Operative Craftsman needed to carry on the construction during this time. If we had not become Speculative Masons, our Craft was faced with extinction. Many of the institutions of that day did pass into oblivion; but, by becoming Speculative, the Craft has grown to a point never envisioned by its founders. Much of this growth can be attributed to the formation of the Grand Lodge of England, at the meeting of the four old Lodges of England, who held a meeting in the Goose and Gridiron Tavern in 1717, at which a man by the name of Anthony Sayer was elected Grand Master. From there, Masonry spread over much of the world. THE BASIC TEACHINGS OF THE SECOND DEGREE As mentioned, the Fellow Craft degree symbolizes the years of manhood and responsibility during a Freemason’s life on earth. During these years, he obtains knowledge and applies this knowledge to the building of his character, and improving the society in which he lives. 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The father of our Masonic Rituals, William Preston, perceived Masonry to be used to educate man in the liberal arts and sciences. In the Ritual of the Degree, a Fellow Craft is urged to advance his education in these fields and understand the symbolic importance of these liberal arts and sciences. THE PREPARATION The changes in dress from an Entered Apprentice to a Fellow Craft have been explained by the ceremony. Gaining admission is similar to the First Degree, with the addition of a password, which is given for him by his conductor. As in the preceeding degree, knowledge is freely given. THE RECEPTION You were received into the Lodge on the angle of a square. The square is symbolically used as a measure of your future actions not only with Freemasons but with all mankind. THE CABLE-TOW The Cable-Tow symbolizes the length of your obligation. THE OBLIGATION The Obligation is the heart of every Degree, and its solemnity must be impressed upon every candidate. The penalties have the same significance as those invoked in the First Degree and are symbolic rather than physical, as already explained. THE WORKING TOOLS The Square is the symbol of morality and virtue. The direction of the two sides of the Square form an angle of 90 degrees, or a right angle, so-called, because this is the angle which stones must have if they are to be used to build a stable and upright wall. When we part upon the Square, we go in different directions, but in full knowledge that our courses in life should be according to the angle of the Square (which means in the right direction) until we meet again. The Level is a symbol of equality. Each person is endowed with a worth and dignity and should not be subject to man-made distinctions. The equality practiced in Freemasonry recognizes that one man may have greater potential in life, service, or reward, than another; but, each can aspire to any heights, no matter how great. Thus, the Level dignifies labor and the man who performs it. It also acknowledges that all men are equal without regard to station. The Plumb is a symbol of uprightness of conduct. In Freemasonry, it is associated with the plumb line which the Lord promised Amos He would set in the midst of his people, )"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Israel, symbolizing God’s standard of divine righteousness. The plumb line in the midst of a people should mean that they will be judged by a higher sense of right and wrong, and not by the standards of others. When the plumb line is thought of in this way, it becomes a symbol of an upright life and of the conscience by which each person must live. THEJEWELS The attentive ear, the instructive tongue, and the faithful breast remind the Freemason that the time-honored method of instruction is byword of mouth. TheseJewels should signify the necessity to learn to utilize good Masonic instruction and develop a devotion to the teachings of our Craft. THE WAGES Corn, Wine, and Oil are symbolic wages which are earned by the Fellow Craft who completes his work. Corn represents nourishment, Wine is refreshment, and Oil represents joy. Taken together, Corn, Wine, and Oil represent the rewards of living a good life. THE PILLARS There are two pillars placed in the porch of King Solomon’s Temple, which are symbolically represented within every Lodge. As found in the First Book of Kings 7:2 1, these pillars bear the names Boaz and Jachin and are symbols of strength and establishment--and by implication, power and control. One must remember that power without control is anarchy, and that control without power is futility. Man must have both if his life is to be successful. THE GLOBES ON THE COLUMNS These are the celestial globe and terrestrial globe and are symbols of universality. THE WINDING STAIRS This represents the progress of an inquiring mind, toiling and laboring toward intellectual cultivation and study. This is the acquirement of knowledge. The Winding Stairs, by their very shape, are also symbols of courage and faith. The symbolism of numbers is first presented to the new Mason in the Winding Stairs lecture. 1 . The first three steps represent the three principal officers of the Lodge. 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2. The second group of five steps teaches the use of order in architecture, and that this order must be applied to our own spititual temple. 3. The final seven steps symbolize the crowning glory of man--the development of both mind and spirit, and the acquisition of the courage and faith which causes each person who possesses these virtues to climb to the summit and attain the rewards that await those who labor. These are the symbolic wages of a worthy Fellow Craft, and are represented by the seven liberal arts and sciences. ADMISSION TO THE MIDDLE CHAMBER The passage from the outer porch to the Middle Chamber represents man’s journey from ignorance to enlightenment. His wages as a Fellow Craft are received in the Middle Chamber. The candidate must also find the doors to knowledge--the outer and inner entrances. To enter one of these, he needs a password. To go through the other, he must have a word. Help is given him in each instance, but such assistance is limited. This signifies that man must acquire knowledge chiefly through his own effort, though he is often dependent upon others for some help. THE MIDDLE CHAMBER In modern Freemasonry, the Middle Chamber is the symbolic place of reward. This was thought of as the place where the Fellow Craft met to receive wages for their labors on the Temple of Solomon. They assembled on the evening of the sixth day of the week, and those who were entitled to the wages of a Fellow Craft were invested with certain mysterious signs, tokens, and a word, which enabled them to pass the outer and inner guards and to enter the Middle Chamber. If they did not have the proper identification, they did not get into the Middle Chamber to receive wages. KING SOLOMON’S TEMPLE Freemasonry did not originate in this Temple ofJerusalem, but our rituals are enriched by reference to this magnificent structure. For a full description of the Temple, you should read the Biblical accounts found in the First Book of Kings, Chapters 5 through 7, and the record of another writer found in the Second Book of Chronicles, in chapters 2 through 4. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE LETTER G The letter G is a symbol of Geometry, as well as a higher and holier significance. Man is reminded that God is in all nature and in every man. Our life and all its blessings come from Him in an orderly fashion. These are disrupted only by the vileness of man when he does something contrary to the Divine Will. The letter G is placed in the center of the Masonic emblems worn by many here in the U.S., but not by Masons in England or other Nations. THE EMBLEMS OF A FELLOW CRAFT These include the Plumb, Square, and Level; Corn, Wine, and Oil; the Pillars in the Porch; the Winding Stairs; the Liberal Arts and Sciences; and the Letter G. The Fellow Craft should become very familiar with them, for they epitomize the lessons of this Degree. THE RIGHTS OF A FELLOW CRAFT You have the right to attend a Lodge when opened in the Fellow Craft Degree. You may visit another Lodge opened in the Fellow Craft Degree. You have the right to be instructed and examined. If you are found proficient and worthy, you have the right for advancement. THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A FELLOW CRAFT The responsibilities are to be found in the Obligation and Charge. You should review these and the Obligation and Charge of the Entered Apprentice Degree. Finally, you are encouraged to acquire knowledge and apply that knowledge to your duties in life and in your dealings with mankind. 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"QUESTIONS FOR THE FELLOW CRAFT MASON 1.
