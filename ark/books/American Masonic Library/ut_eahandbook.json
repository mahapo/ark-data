You have just taken the first step in your Masonic career, and we hope that you found the ceremonies impressive and thought provoking. We offer to you this handbook, that we hope will answer many of the questions you may now have; however, as you were instructed in the Charge of the degree, “you are to converse will well informed brethren”. Therefore, please feel free to ask questions of any other Brother, as they will be happy to assist you in your education. What is the form and layout of the Lodge Room? The form of a lodge is oblong, extending from East to West. It is interesting to note that “Masonic East” does not always face East. The only reason for this is due to the construction of some Masonic Temples. The East however, is always where you will find seated the Worshipful Master of the Lodge. Sitting in front of and to the right of the Worshipful Master you will find the Senior Deacon, and in front of and to the left of the Worshipful Master you will find the Chaplain. Seated in the West is the Senior Warden with the Junior Deacon in front of and to the right of him. In the South you will find the Junior Warden with the Senior and Junior Stewards in front of and at either side of him. The Secretary’s place is to the Left of the Worshipful Master, and the Treasurer is to the right of the Master. The brothers of the Lodge will sit on the “sidelines” on either the South or North side of the Lodge. In the center of the Lodge will be found the Altar, and upon the Altar are the Holy Scriptures. Why is the Master of the Lodge addressed as “Worshipful” Master? “Worshipful” is an old English word signifying “to be respected”. Many today liken it to “Honorable”. Masonically, it is a title of respect for the office of Master and for the Master himself. The brethren of the lodge found him to be sufficient in knowledge, wisdom and integrity, and thus when elected received the title of “Worshipful”. The title of “Worshipful” is also used for “Past Masters” of a lodge, again as a title of respect. Why does only the Master wear a hat? There are two reasons, both symbolic. First, keeping the head covered while all others are uncovered has long been Symbolic of superior rank or office; by the same right, uncovering the head in the presence of superior rank or office has been deemed an act of respect. Second, traditionally the Master of a Lodge wears a hat while presiding over the lodge because King Solomon wore a crown as a mark of royal"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 dignity. You will note that the Master will always remove his hat during prayer. In the Grand jurisdiction of Utah, most Masters will wear a top hat; however, some Master’s choose to wear hats of other designs. This is done at the will and pleasure of the Master. What special courtesies are due the Worshipful Master from the Brethren? There are a number of such courtesies that will be apparent as you become familiar with the Lodge practices. One of which is that when addressing the Master of the Lodge, you should always rise, wait to be recognized, and give the due guard and sign when you begin to speak. Another, of traditional importance is that no member of the Lodge should ever pass between the Master and the Altar while the Lodge is in session, except when it is necessary during degree work. The Master has charge of everything that is essential to a Just and Lawfully Constituted Lodge, particularly the Three Great Lights. His view of these Lights should never be obstructed. Symbolically this signifies, that in his conduct of the Lodge affairs, the Master should never lose sight of the basic principles and tenets of Freemasonry. What are the Powers of the Worshipful Master? The powers of the Master are very great; far more varied and positive than those of any other organization now in existence. From his decisions there can be no appeal to the Lodge. He is answerable only to the Grand Lodge for acts growing out of his official duties. A list of his duties would be very long indeed, and most certainly incomplete. In short he has the right and duty to bar from entrance, or remove from the Lodge any brother that may be in a condition incompatible with the professions of a Mason. He has the power to regulate discussion in the lodge and to terminate debate whenever he sees fit. What is the symbolism of the Masonic Altar? The altar is one of the most ancient symbols of mankind. It has had great significance for all ages since the dawn of history, and you might profitably devote hours to the study of this one subject. In Masonry, the altar, among other things, is a Symbol of Faith. On it rest the Three Great Lights, and to it comes the candidate in search of light and to offer himself, symbolically, to the service of his fellow man and the Grand Architect of the Universe. Here he takes his obligations, traditionally considered more solemn and binding when taken at an altar then under any other circumstance. In every activity of the Lodge, the altar is the focal point for all the Brethren, that the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 precepts for which it stands and the Lights that rest thereon may guide their every thought and action. The Obligation What is the real purpose of the obligation? When you repeat the obligation and seal it, you have solemnly bound yourself to Freemasonry, and assumed certain duties that are yours for the rest of your life, even if you should someday leave the fraternity. Taking the obligation is visible and audible evidence of your sincerity. The obligation itself has a two-fold purpose. It binds you to Freemasonry. It also protects the fraternity against someone revealing secrets that deal with modes of recognition and symbolic instruction. You should understand that the great truths which Masonry teaches are not secret, but he signs and words that Freemasons use to identify Brethren of the Craft are considered secret and need to be treated accordingly. What actual penalties will I incur of I violate my obligations? As you were instructed prior to taking your obligation, “As all Entered Apprentices have taken before you”, your obligation contains penalties, which are only symbolic, and have never been applied to a Mason, by a justly constituted Masonic authority. Violation of a member’s obligation may subject him to the scorn of his brethren and to losing his rights of membership, but never to physical punishment of any kind. The ancient penalties are retained in the obligations to emphasize how seriously the fraternity regards the responsibilities assumed by a Mason. There is no intention of inflicting the penalties stated in the obligation. The violation of a Masonic Obligation is a most serious offense, which may deserve severe punishment. These punishments could be a reprimand, suspension, or expulsion from the Fraternity. If a Mason is said to have violated their obligation, they may be summoned to appear before a Masonic court. The charges would be heard, and a decision would be handed down. If in the case of expulsion, only the Grand Lodge of Utah has the authority of re-instate a member. What is a clandestine Lodge and Clandestine Mason? A clandestine Lodge is one that is operating with a charter that has been issued by a Grand Lodge that is not recognized as “Regular”. An individual that belongs to one of these Lodges is a clandestine Mason."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 Though clandestine lodges are rare, they do exist. It is very important that any member wishing to visit a Lodge be sure to find out if the Grand Lodge of Utah recognizes the visiting Lodge. Each Lodge in Utah has a book called “List of Lodges”. This book is updated each year. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask for that book to review, or check with the Grand Lodge of Utah. What is the purpose of the Due Guard and Sign? The Due Guard and Sign are primarily a reminder to you of your obligations and it’s use is a silent pledge to continue to perform them faithfully. The Due Guard and Sign are also used as a salutation, to be used when entering or retiring from a lodge while in session. It is also to be given when addressing the Worshipful Master, or any other officer or Brother in the Lodge. Why do Masons wear aprons? The use of the apron is ancient. As you were told during the degree, the apron of the entered apprentice was worn to protect the clothing. This is only one purpose for the apron. The Apron is at once an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason. By innocence is meant clean thinking and clean living, a loyal obedience to the laws of the Craft and sincere good will to the Brethren. The Badge of a Mason signifies that Masons are workers and builders, not drones and destructionists. How should I wear my apron? In Utah no clothing is to cover the Masonic apron. The apron must be the outer most piece of clothing. So when wearing a coat the apron must be worn on the outside. What is the significance of the “Northeast Corner”? The Northeast Corner is traditionally the place where the cornerstone of a building is laid. The Apprentice is, therefore, so placed to receive his first instruction on which to build his moral and Masonic edifice. As such, you are a cornerstone on which the Fraternity is to be erected. It is our hope and expectation that you will prove a solid foundation, true and tried, set foursquare on which our great fraternity may safely build. You are the future of Masonry. What is the significance of the “Working Tools”? The Working Tools, presented to the candidates, are those used by the ancient operative craftsman in the erection of the building on which he was working. To the Speculative Mason, these represent the moral habits and forces by which man shapes and reshapes the essence of his human nature. By these symbolic tools, he also fits his own behavior to society and community. While they do not contain the whole"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 philosophy of Masonry, the various Working Tools allocated to the three degrees, by their very presence, they declare that there is constructive work to be done; and by their nature, indicate the direction this work is to take. Why do I need to memorize part of the ritual after each degree? The series of questions and answers that you are requested to commit to memory following each Degree are intended to: (1) Teach each candidate the language of Freemasonry. (2) Fix in his mind the teachings of the Degree. (3) Impress upon his consciousness the different points of the Obligation he has assumed. (4) To enable him to prove, to his satisfaction and that of his Brethren, that he is a Mason. One you prove your proficiency, you will then be eligible to advance to the next degree. What are the emblems of the Entered Apprentice? The Entered apprentice should study all the Emblems of the Degree, for each is important and should be thoroughly understood by him. For example, the lamb is usually an emblem of innocence. The emblem suggests truth to the mind. The twenty-four inch gauge is an emblem of the twenty-four hours of the day. This emblem suggests a wise use of time. The common gavel reminds us that as rough ashlars (rough stones) our characters can be made into perfect ashlars (polished stones) by applying the teachings of Freemasonry in our daily thoughts and actions. When do I stand or sit down? The gavel in the hands of the Master of a Lodge is one of the symbols of authority by which he governs. When the gavel is sounded once in the East, at the beginning of Lodge, the Brethren must come to order. Two raps call the Officers to their feet, and three raps mean that all Brethren must stand. If everyone standing, one rap seats everyone in the Lodge. If the Worshipful Master addresses you by name, arise, face the East, give the due guard and sign of the Degree and listen to his instructions. If you wish to speak, arise and wait until the Master recognizes you; give the due guard and sign of the Degree and then address your remarks to him. What does it mean for the Lodge to be tyled, and who is the tyler? The Tyler guards the avenues approaching the Lodge. A Lodge is said to be duly tyled when the necessary precautions have been taken to guard against intrusion by cowans, eavesdroppers or other unauthorized persons. (A cowan is one who tries to masquerade as a Mason. He is one"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 who has not done the work, but says he has in order to gain admittance. An eavesdropper is one who tries to steal the secrets of our Society. He is the one who would forge a good dues card, or finds one and masquerades as the owner.) If a Brother comes to Lodge late and wants in, the Tyler sees that he is properly clothed and then vouches for him as qualified to enter. It is the duty of the Tyler to inform the Junior Deacon when a Qualified Brother wishes to enter the Lodge and to let the Brethren know in which Degree the Lodge is working. Why Prayer & Why do we say “So Mote it Be”? No Lodge can be opened, stay open or be closed, without prayer -which is offered by the Master or Chaplain. The prayer is universal in nature, and not peculiar to any one religion or faith. At the end of prayer, each member responds with the words “So Mote it Be”, which means in modern English “So may it ever be”. What are my Masonic rights as an Entered Apprentice? An Entered Apprentice has limited privileges. As an Entered Apprentice, you have not yet signed the bylaws of the Lodge. As an Entered Apprentice, you have the right to attend meetings that are held on the EA Degree. You may also visit other Lodges, providing a member who may vouch for you as a new Entered Apprentice accompanies you. You have the right to receive instruction on the EA degree and to ask for the opportunity to prove your proficiency in the degree. Entered Apprentices however, do not have the right to vote, attend lodge while conducting business on the Fellow Craft or Master Mason Degree or receive a Masonic burial. What is the proper dress for a Lodge Meeting? The proper attire for attending a Lodge meeting is normally a coat and tie. Do not, however, let this prevent you from attending lodge. If you do not have a coat and tie, wear the most appropriate clothing you can. If you are participating in a degree, installation, or some other special function, you should always wear the best you can afford. In many Lodges, the dress for officers is the tuxedo. You do not need to rush out and buy a tuxedo. Talk to the members of your lodge, they will instruct you on how best to dress. Can I wear Masonic Jewelry? Masonic jewelry should not be worn by anyone, unless they can prove themselves a Mason. You should therefore"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 avoid wearing any Masonic jewelry until you have passed your proficiency in the Master Mason Degree. At that time you will have paid your dues, signed the bylaws, and been given a dues card to prove yourself. Additionally, almost all Masonic jewelry is emblematical of the Master Mason Degree. As an Entered Apprentice, you are not yet entitled to display or wear anything that is representative of the Master Mason Degree. How do I address other members of the Lodge? All of the officers and brethren deserve your respect, and as a brother, you deserve their respect. As such, Jeff, Pete, and Steve are not the proper way to give a salutation. As we are all brothers, you should give your salutation by saying “Brother Johnson”, Worshipful Brother Johnson”, “Brother Senior Warden”, etc. How do I know what title to use when addressing a brother or Officer? All members are first and foremost Brothers. Officers of the Lodge may be addressed by using their title or name. For instance; “Brother Senior Deacon”, or “Brother Jones”. Worshipful Masters and Past Masters have earned the title “Worshipful”, therefore when addressing them, you should use that title; “Worshipful Master” or “Worshipful Brother Jones”. Members of Grand Lodge are addressed as “Worshipful”, with the following exceptions. Deputy Grand Master, Senior Grand Warden, and Junior Grand Warden are all addressed as “Right Worshipful”; “Right Worshipful Senior Grand Warden”, or “Right Worshipful Brother Jones”. The Grand Master is addressed as “Most Worshipful”; “Most Worshipful Grand Master”, or “Most Worshipful Brother Jones”. The title of “Most Worshipful” is also used for all Past Grand Masters. What is the procedure for leaving entering or retiring from the Lodge room during opening or closing? During the opening and closing ritual no one is permitted to enter or leave the Lodge room. How do I enter or retire while Lodge is open? You will approach the altar, give the due guard and sign, and when the Master returns the due guard and sign, you may be seated or retire from the lodge."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 If entering the Lodge, the Tyler will inform the Junior Deacon that you are waiting entrance. You will then be admitted and approach the altar. This Space Reserved for individual Lodge Customs"}]
