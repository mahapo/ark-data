The Digest of Decisions should be examined in conjunction with the Constitution and Standing Regulations in determining all the Maine Masonic law on a given subject. In 1991, M.W. Robert V.

A major consideration was to make the information and organization of the book more readable and easier to locate. The Digest of Decisions was the major consideration to be worked on.

Declaration Freemasonry is a charitable, benevolent, educational, and religious secret society, adhering to its own peculiar ancient landmarks. Its methods of recognition and of symbolic instruction are secret and thereby a test of membership is provided, though a Brother is traveling in foreign countries and among those who would otherwise be strangers. It is religious in that it teaches monotheism, the Volume of the Sacred Law is open upon altars whenever a Lodge is in session, worship of God is ever a part of its ceremonial, and to its neophytes and Brethren alike are constantly addressed lessons of morality; yet it is not theological. It is educational in that it teaches a perfect system of morality; based upon the Sacred Law, by a prescribed ceremonial; and it also provides libraries and opportunities for study therein. It is benevolent in that it teaches relief of the poor and distressed as a duty, and exemplifies the duty by relief of sick and distressed Brethren by caring for the widows and orphans of the Brethren, by maintaining homes for the aged and distressed Brethren and their dependents, and by providing for the education of orphans. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"It is charitable in that none of its income inures to the benefit of any individual, but all is devoted to the improvement and promotion of the happiness of mankind. It is a social organization only so far as it furnishes additional inducement that men may foregather in numbers, thereby providing more material for its primary work of training, of worship, and of charity. 6 In ancient times, the Brethren met in General Assembly for the ordering of the affairs of the Craft. With growth in numbers, however, it became necessary, in 1717, to adopt a representative form of government, since which time the Brethren have met in Lodges and each Lodge has sent its delegates to a legislative body known as the Grand Lodge.
