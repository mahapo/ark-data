A Constituent Council is seldom stronger or more active then its T. • .I.. Master? Therefore, in order for a Council to have a course of direction, the T. • .I.. Master must have a progren and a knowledge of Council protocol that will provide him with a sense of self assurance prior to assuming the most Illustrious Office of his Council. To this and, it is my extreme pleasure to transmit, to you, the “Authorized Manual for Council Officers” on behalf of your Grand Council. R. & S. N., State of New York. So many have said, nearing the end of their term as ~ , Master, that they wish they had known at the start of the term what they knew at its ending. This “Manual” contains much of such inf or— mation, gained from experience. Although it is not intended to be complete in itself, you will feel your self assurance grow as you absorb its contents. Inasmuch as we anticipate serving in the East in the same year, you in the Constituent Council Line and 3 in the Grand Council Line, I look forward to further communications with you as we plan the mutual aspects of our program together.

This ~‘Authorized Manual for Council Otticera” is iseued by the Grand Council of Royal and Select MasterB, State at New York, through the Office of thin Grand Principal qonductor of the Work. THE CHARM OF GOOD KAN{U~SI Like love, or beauty, or muaje, it conquers where it stands, without force or argument, by its own inherent shining, and is its own justification and reward. Let us shape ourselves to its appeal, whether it be in the uses of politeness, gractous behavior, pleasing conduct, deportment, cordialness or any other of those amenities of words and acts by which among lAB fellows a man Is distinguished a gentleman. Nasonry, like every separate circle in human society, has an ettquette of its own. It a man enters into that protocol without preparation or forethought, and trusting only his own instincts, his manner will strike an awkward note, like a dis - cord jangling across a strain of music. However, it he has 0 trained himself in his part and cauflit the spirit of the whole, bIB MaBonic etiquette will be a conscious work of’ art, with each and every part coordinated to the other, and instinct with a feeling of the whole. ThIB ability to confer pleaaure upon ones fellows when gathered in aBsembly or in ceremony lB not the least of ettquette’ a rewards. The materials In this book are not to be taken as laws, reglflationB, or edicts adopted by Grand Council. They rep— reaent, rather, your many Grand and Past Grand Of ticers own conceptions of the subject, born out of their wide expertence and observation, and are here offered by them as counsel, sug - gestion, advice, and Information. It a reader discoveres omis - sions, or feels that ±‘M11 justic~ has not been done in every case, he is invited to communicate with the current Grand Principal Conductor ot the Work. His suggestions, if accept - able, will be embodied in the next edition. In the spirit of’ “helpfulness and friendliness,” so pecul— tar to Royal and Select Masters, it is intended that this “Manual” Will contribute to your knowledge and provide guidance and ideas as you develop your sense of responsibility and self’ assurance during this——your year sa Principal Conductor of’ the Work. It is our recommendation, to you, that you begin p3anning for your year, as I.. Master, during this year and, for the most parZ, have your plans and program finalized during your year as Deputy Master. It is suggested that signiticant aspects of your program be Thrwsrded on to your couterpart in the Grand Line. In this manner, channels of’ communication will be estab - lished whereby the major problem of’ conflicting dates will be substaxttially minimized and a possible mutual coordination of etfort may serve to benefit our Cryptic Rite.

Master to per - form a courtesy in a manner which can endear himBelt to his own oompanions by expreasins his sincere apprecial.ion tor their ~aitbful support and efforts, and to his guesl.s by the gracious and sincere manner in which he greets them. One ot the nicest ~uidlines given for this portion ot your aBBembly is to make it aB gracious as you would a guest in your own living room. The point is that thiB can be a highlight of your assembLy and not just brushed over as of no consequence. This is a major part of your aBsembly opening. First, always recognize your own PaBt and Current “titled” Companions. At your pleasure, you may then aLso recognize cer - tain other of your own Companions without “tibles” for such things as returnB trom illness, attendtng after Ions distance travel or absence, new baby, wedding anniversary, etc. Remember to recognize your aged Companions when in attendance. Also recognize the I~:astera ot the Lodges, HIGh Priests ot the Chapters, COmmanderB of the Commanderies and of the Consis - tories, reccEnize an~p Thirty—thLrd degree and York Cross of Honor Companions bogether with Potentates and any other heads of !,asonic bodieB. Next recognize all viaitinS, “titled and untitled Compan - ions, iden~ifyin~ reBpect.ive Councils re~presented. Frequently, a visiting Companion may be requesl.ed to rise and introduce the other Companions f~rom his Council. -4- —5—"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Memo A — oontd. Inasmuch as ‘friendliness” is known to abound in Council circles, do your part to uphold the reputation. Assign ycur Conductcr of the Ocuncil to introduce himself to each visitor, to obtain Ms name and Councilt and to personally introduce you~ prior to opening, if time permits. This list may be used by you at time of recognition and passed on to the Recerder for inclusion in the mtnutes. Aveid stumbling, make this routine work to simplify your task and make your guests be glad they ceme. The Recorder will also appreciate this assistance. If any Past Grand Master or current Grand Line Officer is present, he (or they) sheuld be conducted to the East, intro - duced by the I. . Master, accorded Grand Honors and invited to a seat in the East. (They may thank the 10. Master and re - quest his permission to sit on the ‘sidelines.”) However, on the occasion of an Official Visit the invitation to a seat in the East for these Compantona is omitted. If the District Deputy Grand Master is ~resent, he should L/ always be conducted to the East, presented to the Companions, accorded Grand Honors, offered toe Gavel of the Council and a seat in the East. Remember, as the personal representative of the Grand Master, he is the highest ranking Cryptic Mason pres - ent (excepting the Grand Master himself). Mete B “Sickness and Distress” Sickness and Distress is the first crder of business after the proceedings of the preceding assembly, or the dispensing with same. This Order of Business is always in erder. The first item under this’ Order of Buatness is to anocunce the death of any Companion since the last assembly. Endeavor to create atmosphere in a sincere effort to shew respect in memory of the departed Companion. Do not just give dates. It is here sug - gested that a close Companion, of the departed, be appointed to write up a short eulogy to be read by him and incorporated in the minutes. Always have the Chaplain give the prayer. A suggested procedure is as follows—— The 10. Master rises and raises the Council. He may say, “Companions, it is my sad duty to announce the passing of ___________ on the — day of _________ and year.” Order the Captain of the Guard to drape tho Alter. The Captain of the Guard will request the Conductor of the Council and Marshal (or Steward) to assist him. At this moment, it will be most effective for the I.. Master and his officers in the East to descend and at the same time the Sentinel will lower the lights. After the draping of the Alter, with every - one remaining as is, call upon the Companion to read the Eulogy. Following this, direct the Marshal to conduct the Chaplain to the Alter where he will give the sign of Fidelity and kneel. The Marshal will stand at Fidelity and reconduct the Chaplain back to his station. At thia -7- —6—"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Memp H - contd. Memo H — contd. point the l.~. Master and his Officers will return and the I.. Master will state, “It is my order that this Alter remain draped for a period of 30 days in his, or their, memory.” This willt be the signal for the Sen - tinel to raise the lights after a short moment of hesttation. The I.~. Master will seat the Companions and inquire if anyone knows of a Companion in sickness or distress. As the I.~. Master, this is a subject that should be of considerable concern to you. Your Companions mean a lot to you and the Council. Let this topic be emphasized to all present, ask for details in addttion to those given. Now that you have this informatton, what are you going to do with it? Will your sick or distressed Companion hear from iYc,o 1 you or the Council? have-they been present when the Recorder was merely directed to send a card to other Companions which seemed to satisfy everyone and they were thus forgotten? If so, the card could become a mockery to them. It would seem that a Special Committee should be appointed for the visitation, telephoning the Companion or fazily, and especially asking contact with his wtfe. This Committee could report again at the next Assembly, be discharged and another Special Committee be appointed until the ensuing Assembly. There are some Companions that have oeen sick and confined for years and only hear from the Council, other than an Assembly Bulletin, when they are behind in their dues. There are many Companions who have been staunch supporters and now wonder why they have been forgotten. Actually. all that is needed is a little, definite orocedure snarked with sincerity. You may find a Compsnion in i’eal need. All Companions will be endeared to the Council and the Companions will be experiencing one of the finer things in life through these Committees. Personally correspond, at least once during your term, with every Companion on the Membership Rolls who has not been present for a year or about whom no report has been rendered. Do not assign any of this work to your Recorder. Memo C — “Formal Reception of Cfficial and Distinguished Visitors” Formal reception has a significant separation within it. On the one hand there is authority. The top authority in the Council rests with the TO. Master unless there is present the District Deputy Grand Vaster of lAs District, a representative of the Grand Master by specIal appoint - ment, or the Grand Vaster himself. These Grand Officers never “crave” or “seek adnittance,” for they may ~alk in, take the Gavel from the Faster, and preside over the Assembly, whether the Master wills it or not. A District Deputy Grand raster is required by our Constitu - tional Law to visit officially every Council in his District at least once during his term. He comes there to perform an official —9— —8—"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Memo C — contd. Memo C — contd. inspection of the written proceedings, books of record, the Charter, paraphernalia, equipment, place of assembly, the finan - ces of the Council and to observe the Ritual. He also brings with him the message of the Grand Master. This me~sage con - tains matters of importance concerning which the Grand Master, in his wisdom, deems it necessary to inform the Council. The remarks of the Deputy then are of supreme importance. It is his evening. Mo progrsm of speeches other than his should be allowed. What he has to say should stand out——nothing must detract from it. Except upon his own express invitation, no one should sit in the East with the District Deputy Grand Master, during his official visit, except the three Council Officers and the Chaplain. The protocol for formally receiving the District Deputy Grand Master, on the occasion of his Official Visit, is as follows and it is without exception. d Preceding the Assembly, the 10.. Master should appoint the Official Escort who should be among the highest ranking Companions of the Council and capable of the task. Immediately following “Sickness and Distress,” in the Order of Business, the I.e. Master should rise and say, “I will now excuse our District Deputy Grand Master so that he may be formally received. R.~.I0 • Companion ____________, will you kindly escort him.” The Escort should offer his right arm and the two should I, 4 properly apprdach West of the Alter, salute the 10. Master, and retire under escort. There should be absolutely no waiting at this point. The alarm should be sounded immediately and the Escort should be in possession of the rank, name and title so as to impressively mske the announcement. As soon as the I... Master is ready to receive the District Deputy Grand Master, he will direct the Captain of the Guard to answer the alarm. The Steward will open the door and the Escort will stand in the doorway and proclaim that, “R. • .1... ________ District Deputy Grand Master of the _________ Cryptic District of the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters of the Stete of Mew York, is about to enter.” The Escort will then take one step back, offer his right arm to the District Deputy Grand Master, and they will immediately proceed, in step, to the po - sition West of the Alter where they will salute the 10. Master and immediately proceed to the East. Immediately upon the en - trance, of the District Deputy Grand Master, under escort, the 10 • Master will raise the Council and it is most fitting that everyone in Assembly applaud his entrance and continue the ap - plause up to the moment the 1.’. Master is about to present him to the Companions present. As the District Deputy Grand Master approaches the East, under Escort, the 10. Master should descend, extend his right hand and, still retaining the hand clasp, right about face and plsce his left hand on the right elbow of the District Deputy —11— -10—"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Memo C - contd. Grand Master. The District Deputy Grand Master will immediately release the arm of his escort and be thus ushered up into the East by the I.~ • Raster who will left about race and present him as follows—— “Companions, it is my orivileme to present to you R. • Companion ____________, District Deputy Grand Master of the _____________ Cryptic District of the Grand Council, Royal and Select Masters of the State of Nev~ York. Grand Honors teking time from the Escort.” At the conclusion of the Grand Honors, the I.~ • Master should thank the Escort and, turning to the District Deputy Grand Master, say- - “R.~ .10. Companion ____________ , it is my orivileme to tender the Gavel of __________ Council Rurber , Royal and Select Masters, to you.” Some I. ~. Masters will be more gifted and express the honor of this visit in gracious terms. Howev&’, the I. Master should always remember that, on this occasion, he is orivilemed to tender the Gavel. The District Deputy Grand Master is your boss. Identically the sane protocol should be employed when a special representative of the Grand Master makes an Official Visit. Cn the occasion of the Visit of the Grand Ilaster himself, the Visit is always Official. The I.~. Master will appoint an “Acting Grand Marshal” unless the Grand Marshal is present with the Grand Master. I Memo C — contd. Immediately following “Sickness and Distress” in the Crder of Business, the I.. Master should request the Grand Master to retire, under escort, so that he may be formally received. Quite often the Grand Master may prefer to wait outside the Council until the conclusion of “Sickness and Distress” in the Order of Business. This will particularly be true if many mem - bers oV his Grand Line are present with him. The Sentinel should alert the Grand Marshal at the conclu - sion or “Sickness and Distress.” The Grand Marshal makes the alarm. Before answering the alarm, the I. . Master should in - struct the Companions in the giving of urivate Grand Honors. When the Steward answers the alarm he will be told that “R0 .10. ____________, Grand Marshal, seeks admittance.” Cr, “R020. ___________, Acting Grand Marshal, seeks admit - tance.” If there are Grand Line Cfficers present he will say “R. • .I.~. Companion ____________• Grand Marshal together with several Grand Line Officers seek admittance.” The 10. Master will admit them whereupon the Grand Marshal will proceed to West of the Alter, salute the 10. Master, immediately proceed to the East where he will raise the Council and proclaim that “Ii. .10. Companion ____________, Grand Iaster of the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masons of the State of New York, is about to enter.” He will immediately return without salut— ins, extend his right arm to the Grand Master whereupon they will approach to West or the Alter, salute the I.~. Master and proceed immediately to the East. Applause should begin —12— -13—"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I Memo C — contd. immediately upon his entrance and continue until the I.•. Master is about to present him. The I•~• Master will despend as de - scribed with the Distrtct Deputy Grand Master. Remember you are receiving the highest authority of all Cryptic Masonry in the entire State of New York. Should there be Grand Officers present, they will follow the Grand Marshal upon his entrance, salute the 1.’. Raster, and as the Grand Marshal approaches the East, they will form two lines, West of the Alter, through which the Grand Master will pass. Thrcughout all of the reception of authority, it you keep in mind the theme that yours is one of King Solomon’s Provinces and conduct yourself in what you believe the spirit of that Province in formally receiving its King, and/or his personal representatiVes of authority, you will have the proper foun - dation on which to proceed according to Cryptic protocol. C Of course, this foundation will maifltain the proper re - lationship which, without it, would become rather difficult. It should be remembered at all times that the R. • .1..., and M. .I.., Companion is representing the Office he fills. Respect for that Office is frequently confused with respect for the Companion filling it. The Companion tilling the Office, regardless of his own personal desires, must, out of respect for the Office he tills, comply with all aspects of proper Cryptic protocol, likewise, you, as I.. Master, have a sim - ilar role to fullfil in respect to your Office as do the —14— Memo C — contd. Companions of the Circle of Perfection. Endeavor to create the atmosphere that would prevail in a Province that is about to be formally visited by King Solomon, or his special emissary. Impress your Companions that a celeb - rity will be in their midst. Devote some buildup in your Bul - letin and particularly in the local press. The Official Visitor will provide you with a suitable “mat,” together with a short resume for your use in building up his visit in the local press. By all means, it is your responsibility on behalf of the public relations of your own Council, to have press coverage on the occasion of the Official Visit. We stated that there was a significant separation on the occasion of Official visitions. We have dealt with those repre - senting the authority of the Grand Raster and the Grand Master himself. On the other hand, there is the visitor who repre - sents no authority, but does officially represent your Grand Council. You night liken this position to one who represents the Court of lUng Solomon. He is a member of the top official - dom in the Kingdom and participates in the top level discussions and decisions with the Grand Master and, indeed, is smong the official fsnily from whom the Grand Raster selects his official representatives for special assignments when it is his pleasure to have a representative other than hii District Deputy Grand Master. This is an occasion of good fellowship and can be a high— light in your year if you meke it such. He is szsong those from —15— ‘I"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Memo C — contd. Memo C — contd. whom, someday, one will be elevated to the Most Illustrious Office of Grand Master. It is the sincere hope of Grand Council that this fellowship will provide the Companions with a firsthand acquaintance, with their Grand line and Future Grand Master, as well as provide-the Future Grand Master with the strong ties that will be so essential to him when he is elevated to that Most Illustrious Office. The entrance of the Official Visitor, representing Grand Council, differs from that of authority in the following re - spects. A Companton of high rank, and capability, is appointed to be the Escort.” The 10. Raster should direct him to waste no time in msking the alarm. He, or the Sentinel, should advise the Steward that “R. .1.,. ____________, and title, is here to make his Official Visit.” The door is closed while the Steward reports the cause of the alarm. The 10. Master will give the order to “admit him.” The Escort will extend his right arm to ox the Official Visitor and they will approach to lest of the Alter where they will salute the I.’ • Master and the Escort will pre - sent him to the 10. Master. (Upon their entrance, the 10. Baster raises the Council and applause is in order and again as they approach the East.) The I.e. Master will welcome the Official Visitor and direct him to continue to the East under his Escort. Here, it must be remembered that the 10 • Master is the highest ranking Officer present, it is his Council and he is a .4 formally re&eiving the distinguished Visitor at his awn pleasure. He does not descend to greet the Official Visitor, but remains izi the East. The Escort, upon arriving at the East, does not ascend, but takes the OfticialVisitor’s left hand with his left hand and places his right hsnd on the left elbow- of the Official Visitor and assists him in beginning his ascent to the East. The I.e. Master extends his right hand, to the Official Visitor, and completes the assistance into the East. The Official Visitor will right about face and be on the right of the 10. Master, the Deputy Baster having pLaced himself one further position to the right. The 10. Master will have already raised the Companions immediately upon the entrance of the Official Visitor, with his Escort, and at this time will say, “Companions, it is my pleas - ure to present to you R. • .1.~. ___________, and title, Grand Honors, taking time from the Escort.” Immediately following the Grand Honors, the I. • Master will thank the Escort, using his full title and neme. The Escort will be seated on the sidelines. The 10 • Master will again turn to the Official Visitor and welcome him to his Council in a manner that becometh a gracious host. He will then say, “It is my aleasure to extend to you the Gavel of (give the nsme and number of the Council).” It will be noted here that we have consistently specified the time, and the Order of Business, when an Official Visitor should be received. We well realize that, on many an occasion, —16— —17—"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Memo C — contd. i4emo C - eontd. this has not been the practice. Thomas Paine is credited with having said, “A long habit of thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of ~custom.” From the standpoint of logic, can you imagine the Ruler of a Province making ICing Solomon, or his special emissary, wait until some business is transacted before he takes time to re - ceive him? If you were to host guests in your own home, would you make them wait for you to conduct many items of business and then suddenly turn on the charm and greet tham as though it was just another business item on the agenda? We recommend that you remember you are the host and en - deavor to be just as gracious as you would be if you were hosting within your own home. Cn the one hand, you would be hosting your “boss” and all the authority over your future he represents, and on the other hand you would be hosting a very distinguished celebrity in your home. With tl~ese thoughts in U mind, you will be better equipped to~ motivate a gracious spirit in the protocol for the occasion. There is much that such a thought will solve for you. For instance, if you were hosting in your home, would you put forth an extra effort to see that what transpires in your home is in good taste? Would you dress for the occasion? Would there be an extra effort to impress your guest of the graciousness of your household? Remember, you only get out of it what you put 24 a into it. And, as in your home, you can receive much pleasure from the occasion. Remembering that Official Visitors represent a Grand Office, they are obliged out of respect for their Office to observe certain protocol. On the occasion of his Official Visit, he must be suitably dressed for the occasion, including the Cfficial Apron and Jewel of his Office. After 6:00 p.m., the mode of dress will normally be tux. Again, how would you accommodate a guest, who has traveled at length and is desirous of washing and dressing for the occasion of the evening? In the case of the District Deputy Grand Master, the mode of dress is strictly at his own discretion inasmuch as he main - tains a constant working relationship with his respective Councils. On the occssion of an Official Visit representing authority, only the Official Visitors should be formally received. Any deviation should be at the pleasure of the Official Visitor of authority. He is the highest ranking Companion and there should be no distractions on the occasion of his Official Visit. On the occasion of the Official Visit of a Grand Officer, without authority, this is a gala event. The protocol is at the pleasure of the 10. Master. Whenever the District Deputy Grand Master is present, he is always the ranking Companion, rollowed by the 10. Master and the Official Visitor, in that order. The District Deputy Grand Master should, on these occa - sions, be formally received. From the standpoint of diplomatic —18— —19—"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Memo Q — contd. Memo C — contd. etiquette, the District Deputy Grand Master will permit the distinguished guest to be received last, whereas tbip is al - ways the place of the District Deputy Grand Master except when the GI’and Master himself is preseilt. The District Deputy Grand Master, on these occasions, should be formally received as previously described and, after Grand Honors, the I.e. Master is trivile~ed to tender Mn the Gavel of’ his Council. Again, from the standpoint of diplomatic etiquette, the District Deputy Grand Master will accept the Gavel, seat the Companions, express his pleasure at being with them on this auspicious occasion and immediately return the Gavel to the I.e. Master. While the District Deputy Grand Master has the Gavel in his hand, it will enable him to position himself to the left side, of the I.. Master, when he returns the Gavel to ~ I.e. Master. En this manner, the proper re— epect for the authority present is never slighted and the District Deputy Grand Master is afforded the opportunity of U adding to the graciousness of the evening. It is anticipated that he will not attempt to detract from the distinguished guest in any manner. On the occasion of the Official Visit, it is proper for the 10. Master, if it be his pleasure, to formally receive, in the East, several of his own Companions and perhaps some from visiting Councils. This is very frequently done at Diptrict Conventions and Cryptic Festivals. 4 ) Anyone occupying the East, at such a time, should delegate the responsibility of organizing these receptions so that they may be carried out without any delay and with the utmost, sharp, pomp and circumstance. Direct him to see that the alarms are made most expeditiously as the Officer, occupying the East, con - cludes each reception. Should the presiding Officer decide to formally receive distinguished Companions, in addition to the R.~ .1... Companion of authority and the Official Visitor, he should be sure of him - self as he couLd be treading upon diplomatic thin ice. Be cer - tain that all distinguished Companions are included. Be certain not to omit, through ignorance, one who has served well in years gone by and/Or the distinguished Companions from other districts and Jurisdictions. Following, is their order of reception. 1 — Currently presiding Officers of Grotto, Shrine, Lodge, Coneistory, Chapter and Commandery. 2 — With the exception of Grand Lodge, Past Grand Heads of any of these Orders. 3 — Past Illustrious Masters of constituent Councils. 4 - Past Grand Officers of the Grand Council (This will include Past Grand line Officers who were not ele - vated to the Office of Grand Master, Past Grand Representatives and Past District Deputy Grand Masters including the same from other jurisdictions.). 5 — The holders of the Thirty—Third degree, Scottish Rite, and the York Cross of Honor, York Rite. -20- —21—"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Memo C — contd.

Furthermore, this is a Council Assembly. However, in regard to the Grand Master ot the Grand Lodge, our Order exists at his ~uill and pleasure,( his presence K is always Otticial and we salute him with the Private Grand Honors prescribed by Grand Lodge. On the occasion of the Otticial Visit ot the District Deputy Grand Master, or a special representative ot the Grand Master, should the Grand Master himselt be present, the Grand Master would be received last. The District Depu.ty Grand Master, or the Special Representative ot the Grand Master, has the prerogative ot seating the Companions, atter receiving the Gavel ot the Council, and tormally receiving the Grand Raster or re - turning the Gavel to the Illustrious Master so that he may have the privilege ot tormally receiving the Grand Raster in his own Council. On this occasion, the District Deputy Grand Master will sit on the right ot the Grand Master and? the Illustrious U Master will sit on the lett ot the Grand Master. On such an occasion, the Grand Master will most likely close the Council in short term. The presiding Grand Master is the only one possessing the authority to so close a Council or any Cryptic Assembly. However, should the Gavel be returned to the Illustrious Master, the Grand Master will assume the chair on the immediate right ot the Illustrious Master and the District Deputy Grand Master will move one chair to the right. It should be here noted that an unusual circumstance will occur should the Grand Master ever be present on the occasion ot the Otticial Visit ot the District Deputy Grand Master. How’ ever, on the occasion o~ an Otticial Visit ot the Grand Master, you will normally find the District Deputy Grand Master present. On such an occasion, the District Deputy Grand Master will never be tormally received, as will no one else. However, he will be received in the East as explained under “Recognition” and sit on the left ot the Illustrious Master. In like manner, it will bs an unusual circumstance tor the Grand Raster to be present on the occasion ot the Otticial Visit ot a Grand Line Otticer, without authority. On this occasion, the District Deputy Grand Master will be tormally received, in manner previously prescribed, and be seated on the lett ot the Illustrious Master. After the according ot Grand Honors to the Ctf’icial Visitor, the presiding Otticer will not tender him the Gavel but invite him to a seat in the East. The Otticial Visitor will sit two chairs to the right ot the Presiding Otticer. Inas— much as he is a guest, it is not his privilege to r9ceive the Grand Master into this Council. This is the privilege ot the Presiding Illustrious Master, unless the District Deputy Grand Master usurps the privilege. Ot course, the Grand Master may designate which may have the privilege it it be his pleasure. The Grand Master will, upon seating the Companions and greeting then, tender the Gavel to the ~ticial Visitor, or he may re— turn the Gavel so the Illustrious Master may have the oleasure ot tendering the Gavel to his awn Guest. —24— —25—"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Memo C — contd. Memo C — contd. It should here be noted that the Gavel is always tendered to the Official Visitor immediately following Grand Honors. The only exception would be on the occasion of formaLly receiving the Grand Master before the Official Visitor is tender~d the Gavel. This can be your “big night” of the year so build it up. Write personal letters to the other Illustrious Masters of your District inviting them to attend and urging publicity of’ the visit in their Council and through their Bulletin. As soon as the name of your Official Visitor is known, you write him suggesting the best dates for your Council. This is based on your program and area Masonic activities. Give him more than one date. Make sure the night selected does not con - flict with any “big night” in the local Lodge, Chapter or Commandery. When the date is confirmed, write the Official Visitor again and let him know what you customarily do in your Council. Do you have a preassembly dinner? Is it limitedUto tSe Officers or Past Masters? Will ladies attend the dinner if the Official Visitor’s wife can attend? Would it be more convenient for you to take him to your home for dinner and an opportunity to go over Council problems? Find out how he customarily travels——train, car or plane. If by car let him know the street address of your Temple and its location in the city. If he comes by plane or train let him know who will meet him at the station or airport. Inquire if he plans to stay overnight and, if so, does he want a hotel or motel reser - vation made for him. K Make sure there is a suitable room at the Masonic Temple for the Official Visitor to change into his “black tie.” Treat your distinguished visitor as you would an honored guest in your own home and not as either a rich uncle or poor relative. Re - member, he is taking time, putting forth effort and spending considerable money to make this Official Visit. If your aim is to make him glad he did, then the mutual fellowship that will prevail will provide him with a memorable occasion and will mark your year with a degree of success. Memo D “Petitions for Presentetion” Read Section 38.1 through 38.8 of the Constitution. The minimum fee for degrees, permitted by the Constitution, is $10.00. This is not to be construed as your ceiling. The actual amount is determined by the respective Council as a part of its By—Lews. There is no minimum fee required by the Constitution for Affiliation. The fee, if any, is determined by the respective Council as a part of its By—Laws. A Petition may be received only at a Stated Assembly unless a special dispensation is granted by the Grand Master through the Grand Recorder. It is permissible, under Grand Council regu - lations, to receive, ballot upon and confer the degrees in the same evening. —26- -27-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Memo D — contd. Memo E — contd. In presenting the Petition, the Recorder should read it in its entirety so that all may hear. He should announce the amount of fee received with the Petition. After reeding, the Recorder should say, “Illustrious Master, I move this Petition be receive~7 and a committee appointed.” Then he shouLd pass the Petition to the Illustrious Master. After the motion is seconded, ask for discussion. If there is none, call for the vote. Thereafter, the Illustrious Msster appoints the Investigating Committee. Try to make it your business to know of all petitions in advance of opening so as to have your committees picked out. This should not drag due to unpreparedness. Read your Council By-Laws. Memo E K “Reports of Standing Committees” Committees are useless unless they functi~n. Therefore, U appoint as Chairmen only those who believe in and will follow through on the purposes of the Committee they will head. Sit in on some or all of the Committee Meetings. ex officio, as I.. Meeter. Request that all reports be in writing and that you receive a copy before it is presented to the Council in Assembly. A small committee usually functions best. Mon—titled Companions should not only serve on committees but should be enocuraged to be Chairmen. This frequently reveals good Officer material and will do much toward spreading involvement in Council affairs among the Companions. Some Standing Committees are: Audit and Finance — to audit Recorder’s and Treasurer’s books and records and report on same in the Annual Assembly. This audit should also include those rec - ords in the hands of the Trustees. Together with the I.~. Master, Treasurer and Recorder, this Committee should assist in drawing the budget. By—Laws Committee — This is a Standing Committee appointed for the purpose of reviewing the By—Laws with current year conditions in mind. The By—Laws should never be changed for the sake of change. The By-Law Committee will do well to compile a file on the various matters arising that are affected by the By—Laws including legislation pending in Grand Council. Eventually, with this compiled information, a By-Laws Committee will be in a position to recommend constructive and meaningful changes, on an all—encompassing basis, when sufficient need arises to affect a change. Membershin — The I.. Master should appoint a personable Companion to represent his Council in each of the Lodges, Chapters and Commanderys in his Council’s drawing area. Be certain to place new Companions on this Committee, along with some of the old faith— ~uls. Et is through the new Companions that you will reach others not already known or spoken to. Instruct -28— —29—"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"r Memo E — contd. the members of this Committee to keep ths Coundil advised of special events or degree work in their respective Lodges, Chapters or Commanderys, thereby permitting Council cooperation and paa’ticipa~ion. Also instruct him to keep Lodge, Chapter or Commsndery advised of Council interest and cooperstiOn and also of Council events. Additional Standing Committees may be appointed at the pleasure of the I.. Master and the report of each Standing Committee should be submitted on the occasion of the Annual Assembly. Msmo F “Report of Special Committees” The Special Committee will usually last until the next Assembly or until its purpose has been accomplished. These are U the Committees on which those “too busy” Companions, who are just not available, may find some time to serve. Most all of the new business, if issues are involved or information is to be obtained, will be referred to a Special Committee. Y.ou may appoint a Special Committee to conside!’ and mske recommendations on any matter of subject that may arise. Some of the most common sre: Petitions, Sickness and Distress, Special Events, Anniversary and Refreshments. Memo F - contd. A Specia2 Committee that every I.e. Mastsr should be certain to appoint is the Entertaimment Committee. It will be respon - sible to bring about some social or recreational activity in tha Council during your term. Suggestions are: dinner, ladies’ night, theater party, musical, covered-dish supper, family picnic or something of this nature during the Council’s year. Use your sideliners and especially your new Companions. Afford all of the Companions an opportunity to become invoLved. From your standpoint, as I.% Master, this will serve to strengthen your Council and to support you in your efforts for a successful Council Year. Memo G “Balloting on Petitions” Read Section 39 of the ConstitutLon. The Ballot protects the Council against those not deserving the title of Companion. No one may be excused from the duty of casting his ballot. No CompanLon will permit his vote to be influenced by seLfishness, prejudice or anger’, nor will he divulge his vote, even when questioned about it. Balloting, once begun, must be completed without interrup-. tion or postponement. The Ballot for degrees must be unanimous and secret. The doors should be closely tiled, of course. When about to Ballot, the I.. Master orders the Captain of the Guard to prepare the Ballot Box. He in turn directs the -30-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Memo G — contd. Conductor of the Council to, “Prepare and present the Ballot Box.” Whereupon the Conductor of the Council inspects the Ballot Box to mske certain that it is perfectly clear from the presence of ball and cube, and ihat there is nothing involved that might malfunction. He then presents the Ballot Box to the I.e. Master for his inspection. The I.e. Master will request the other two Council officers to inspect it with him. With inspection concluded, the I.e. Master declares the Ballot to be open and again announces the petitions on which the Ballot is to be cast. He will ballot first, followed by the Deputy Master and the Principal Conductor of the Work. He then direuts the Conductor of the Council to place the Ballot Box on a table West of the Alter, for the balloting of the Companions. This done, he directs all Companions to cast their ballot, specifying “White ball elects, black cube rejects.” All members present having balloted (not just all those who wish to ballot), the Sentinel, if a membetof this Council, U should be relieved and instructed by the I.. Paster before balloting. The balloting, being declared closed by the I.e. Master, the Conductor of the Council then carries the Ballot Box to the East ror the inspection of the Principal Conductor of the Work, Deputy Master and the I.e. Master, in this order. It is the prerogative of the I.e. Master to reballot twice before announcing the results. The E.’. Master then calls for the report of the other r Memo G — contd. two Council Officers——i.e., “How does the Principal Conductor of the Work find the Ballot?” The answer is either “Clear” or “Cloudy.” He will repeat with the Deputy Master. The I.e. Master then states, “And I find the Ballot to be _________ in the East and, therefore, declare _______________ (name the petitioner) to be duly elected to receiVe this Council’s de - grees.” (or, to be rejected.) A Ballot, once declared, cannot be reconsidered. Read Section 38.5 of the Constitution. A collective ballot may be taken on several petitioners at the discretion of the l.~ • Master, with the approval of the Companions. The Ballot must be destroyed by the ~ Master. He may not delegate this duty to any other efficer. Memo H “Communications” Written communications are essential. Courtesy requires a prompt reply. Be care Vul not to overload a RecordEr by making him your personal secretary in regard to correspondence initiated by yourself. If you sign it, you write it. Communications from the Grand Easter, the District Deputy Grand Master and Grand Line Officers, when addressed to the l~¶ Easter, should always be read, in Assembly, by the ~ Master. This is a phase of respect and protocol. The reply, to such —33— -32—"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"I Memo H — contd. communications, should also be made by the I.. Master, person - ally, with a carbon copy being sent to the Council Recorder. Communications between Councils are usually conducted by the Recorders. However, communi~ations between I.e. Masters should not make a personal secretary out of the Recorder. It is proper for the I.. Master to request the Recorder to reply to inter—Council communications on his behalf, should your Council be so fortunate as to have a Recorder with the time to handle such communications. It is wise for the I.e. Master to be versed with all communications prior to the opening of the Assembly. He must remain in controL, not to the concealment of anything, but that the reading of communications may not be permitted to drag on with trivia. Certain communications may be identified and described, rather than read, with the statement that it will be available after Assembly for anyone whc wishes to read it. In addition, the I.•. Master may be better pre~pared to cope with the deliberations that may result from some of the com - municatione. Preparedness may provide the means for readying a situation now rather than waiting until the ensuing Assembly. Memo I “Bills to Pay’ Most every Council is confronted with a certain amount o~’ biLling which could be classified as routine. Some may be Memo I — contd. repeated every month or perhaps just once during the Council year. The I.e. Master, Recorder, Treasurer and Audit and Finance Committee should make a compilation of these routine expenses as being anticipated for the ensuing Council year. In addition to these routine expenses, thought should b~ given to other factors which may require expenditures of money. The end result may be called the Budget for your Council. By dividing the sum total, of these expenses, by a figure representing the number of dues paying Companions in your Council, you will be able to observe that portion of dues which must be allocated for the purpose of paying expenses that are known will be encurred. Add, to this amount of allocation, the gl.OO per capita tax to Grand Council, and observe how close this sum equals the amount of dues per Companion. For the purposes of continuity and preserving the strength of your Council, strive to maintain a minimum of ~l.5O margin above budgeted expenses and per capita tax. Grand Council will release each Council from the ~l.OO per capita tax on any indigent Companion wbose dues the Council finds it necessary to remit from payment. In each and all such cases it is definitely required that the Recorder, of such Council, attach to his Annual Report to the Grand Recorder the following particulars: name of Companion, his address, date of birth, date greeted in Council and the reason dues were remitted. The bills of the evening are read by the Recorder, he then says, ~ Master, these bills are in accordance with the -34- —35—"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Memo I — contd. Memo I — contd. approved budget for the Council, and I move the bills be paid.” After a proper second and discussion, a vote is tsken in accord - ance with Lodge protocol. It is within the prerogative of the I.% Master to say, “Companions you have heard the bills and the motion and the second, if there is no objection, I will order the bills to be paid.” After a significant pause, if there is no objection, the 1.’ • Master may say, “So ordered.” And rap the Gavel once. From the preceding it may be concluded that the Audit and Finance Committee has submitted the “Budget” to the Companions, at their first Fall Assembly, for their approval. This is one of the items in which the District Deputy Grand 1~aeter will be interested on the occasion of his Official Visit. Unless there are undue circumstances involved, no bill should be incurred, prior to approval by the Companions, that has not been provided for in the Budget. The Audit and Finance Committee should be contacted by all Comm4~ttees and Officers who anticipate the need for funds beyond the Budget. This will en - able the Audit and Finance Committee to properly present a de - tailed and consolidated request to the Companions at the next Assembly. It will also prewarn the Officers and Companions when to anticipate cash flow problems and in general facilitate good financial control. For all bills approved for payment, the Recorder will draw an Order, as directed, for the signature of the I.. Master, to which he will attest. This Order will be presented to the —36— Treasurer who will issue the proper check in compliance with the Order. This is a matter that should be performed after the close of Council Assemblies so as not to consume time during the Assembly. Memo J “Unfinished and/or Old Business” For the most part, unless there was a matter previously “tab]ed,” this topic will have been cleared under Reports of Commi ttees. It must be moved, seconded and approved in order to remove a “tabled” matter to the floor for discussion. The parliamentary procedure on motions tabled at a previous Assembly should be carefully studied. Generally a copy of Robert’5 Rules of Order, or any other book on parliamentary procedure, will suffice. It is recommended that, when the I.. Master asks for “un~inished and/or old business,” if there is a motion that has been laid on the table, the Recorder will announce that, “A motIon to _____________ was laid on the table at the last Assembly. I move that this motion be taken from the table for discussion and adoption.” After a proper second and discussion, the I.e. Master will then ask for a vote, and, if favorable, will announce that the subject is now open for discussion. If the vote to remove from the table is negative, the matter contInues to lie on the table. —37— I"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Memo J — contd. Memo K — contd. After proper discussion, the l.. Master will call for a vote and announce the result accordingly. It is p1~oper that a new motion may be made to lay on the table a second time. Such a motion takes precedence over the motion for adoption. Most of the motions laid on the table will involve changes in the By-Laws or some item requiring considerable thouSht and discussion by the Companions. The I.. Master should always be clear on this Order of Business, with the Recorder, prior to opening the Council Assembly. Memo K “New Bu5ine55” The Council Business is important. Here is the opportunity for the I.e. Vaster to blend together the Companions in purpose - ful activity. The open floor seldom provides the full consider— ation a special committee will provide for a matter. With a committee, Companions questions can be given courteous and careful consideration and also avoid deciding between con - flicting viewpoints, in discussion, on the floor. For this reason, many Companions will venture to ask questions for committee con - sideration whereas a Companion may tend to shy away from a floor discussion in order to avoid prolonging or complicating matters. The 1.’. Master can eliminate involved discussion and/or dissension by appointing a committee. Be fair and appoint the outspoken Companions to it if they appear deeply concerned. Use non—Officers, even ror Chairmen. Often, officer material will be revealed and most always you will see Committee members in attendance. Remember t~iat you are not restricted to appointing from just those present. This could be a way to reactivate some Companions. The proper procedure to handle any question on the floor is to, eventually, dispose of it. Normally, this is done by re - questing a motion and a second. If a motion is not forthcoming, or if a second is not forthcoming, the matter dies on the floor and the l.. Master should so declare and the minutes so state. If a motion is received with a second, the motion is then open for discussion, following which a vote is taken. There may be another motion made and seconded, if the previous one is voted down. There may also be an snending motion made prior to the vote on the motion open for discussion. The amending motion must be disposed of before the original motion can be voted upon. Every motion should be open for disoussion betpre calling for a vote. The I.’. Master may request a motion to refer back to Committee or to lay on the table. He may retain an existing Committee or appoint a new one. Here, the r.. Master’s leader - ship and diplomacy is important in effecting the results with harmony and progress consistent with his program. -38— -39-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Memo L “Conferring Degree5” Other Memopanda - contd. The 1.’. Master should take definite steps to see that preparations for the coaferring of degrees are such as will avoid any waiting. Candidates should be prepared in sufficient time (during Assembly). Parapher~nalia should be on hand, ready for rapid placing. A Director of Men and Paraphernalia should be stationed outsIde the secret vault to see that. all moves in timely manner. Memo M “Reading, Correcting and Approval of the Proceedings” The Proceedings must be read and approved before the Council Assembly is closed. All Receipts, received since the last Stated Assembly, should be entered and included as part of the minutes of this Stated Assembly. It is wise if the Recorder will include the Statement of the beginning cash balance plus receipts less disbursements equals the closing cash balance as part of the Minutes of each (r Assembly. “Other Memoranda” These last few pages are left blenk for your convenience. We hope you will find this “Manual” to be of considerable guid - ance in preparation for “Your Year.” It will become more so -40- because of the significant memoranda you enter on these pages during this and the next year. The superscription on Council Communications should always be “Zealously yours.” Following your election and installation of I.’. Master of your Council, you muat receive the T.%I.’. Master’5 degree before you may preside over your Council, after the Assembly of Grand Qouncil has closed. lf you are unable to receive this degree at Grand Council, communicate with the Grand Recorder and your District Deputy Grand ~4aster promptly. As a T..I.~. Master, you will be a permanent member of the Grand Council and are urged to attend the Annual Assembly together with the mid—year Assembly in February of each year. As I.e. Master, there is a wonderful Companionship exper - ience ahead of you while visiting Other Councils during your year. -41-"}]
