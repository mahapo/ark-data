Henceforth we empower you to meet as a regular lodge, constituted in conformity to the rites of our institution and the charges of out ancient and honorable fraternity, and may the Supreme Architect of the Universe prosper, direci and counsel you in all your doings. Amen. RESPONSE (by the brethren): So mote it be. The officers of the Grand Lodge will, under the direction of the Grand Marshal, give the grand honors. The Grand Mar - shah will then slowly replace the covering on the Symbol of the Lodge, during which a choir may chant— “Glory be to God on High.’’ The Grand Marshal will then conduct the Grand Master to his chair and instruct the officers of the Grand Lodge to resume their respective stations and places, and the members of the new lodge to resume their seats. During these move - ments instrumental music may be rendered- INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS The installation of the officers of a new lodge follows immediately after the ceremonies of constituting, and the cere - mony is therefore conducted by the grand officers, while in an old lodge the presence of the Giand Master or othea grand officer is not necessary, as any affiliated Master, or Past Master in good standing, with the assistance of a marshal, can law - fully conduct the ceremonies of installation. If the ceremonies be public the lodge need not be opened. This ceremony, like that of constituting a new lodge, or dedienting Masonic halls, may be conducted in public, or in the presence of Masons only. If the latter, there will be slight variations in the phraseology and ceremonies. The following ceremonies are oppropriate for installing the officers of a newly constituted lodge or those of an old lodge. The variations necessary to observe are noted wherever they occur. The installing officer is addressed as Most Worshipful Biother, Right Worshipful Brother, or Worshipful Brother, accoiding to the rank he has attained. The marshal will see that the jewels of the officers to be installed, together with a Bible, the compasses, a rule (twenty - f our inch gauge,) a plumb line, a Book of Constitutions, the charter, and a copy of the lodge by-laws are placed on a table or stand, at the right and in front of the East, arranged for convenient use. The installing officer will then say: BROTHER (GRAND) SECRETARY: You will an - nounce the names of the officers appointed to govern this (new) lodge. 33"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"34 cEREMONIALS INSTALLATION OF OFFIcERS 35 The word ‘‘appointed’’ is used for all officers in a new lodge, but iu an old lodge the words ‘‘appointed,’’ or ‘‘elected,’’ are to be used as circumstances may require. In presenting the officers for installation the marshal will use the proper word as above. The word ‘‘new’’ should be used on occasion of consti - tuting and installation, but in the installation of officers of an old lodge its name and number should be used. As their names are called the brethren will take their position standing in place, as indicated in ceremony of con - stituting. After the roll of officers is called the installing officer will rise and say: BRETHREN or LODGE: You have heard the names of the brethren who have been se - lected as officers of your lodge for the ensuing terni. If any member present knows of a just cause why any of the brethren should not be installed into office, let him speak now, or forever after be silent. If objection is made, either publicly or privately, to the installation of any of the brethren named as officers, the Grand Master, Deputy Giand Master and Giand Wardens (if in a new lodge), or the presiding officer and three experienced brethren, preferably Past Masters (if in an old lodge) will retire to a private room and cite the objector to appear and give the reason for objecting. If the objection is against the brother to be installed Mas - ter, and it is sustained, the installation cannot proceed until ordered by the Grand Master or the Grand Lodge, because the installation must begin with the Master. If the objection applies to any other officer, and is deemed valid, his installation must be deferred, but the other officers may be installed. The Grand Master or the lodge may sub - sequently make such order in regard to the objection as cir - cumstances may require. In an old lodge the appointment of a deputy is omitted, aud all officers are presented to the installing officer by the marshal commencing with the Master. So much of the cere - mony as is here given by the Deputy Grand Master is omitted. The Grand Master, in case of new lodge, continuing, says: R.W. DEPUTY GRAND MASTER: (Who rises) Are you satisfied that the brother nominated in the war - rant is eligible, and well skilled in the noble science and royal art? DEPUTY GRAND MASTER: I am so satisfied, M.W. Grand Master. The Deputy Grand Master conducts the new Master in front of the East, and continues: And I now present to you my worthy brother to be installed as Worshipful Master of this new lodge. II believe him to be of good morals, and of great skill, true and trusty, and as he is a lover of the whole fraternity, wheresoever dispersed, I doubt not he will discharge his duties with fidelity. The Deputy Grand M~aster resumes his seat.

The marshal presents the Worshipful Master Elect, as follows: Brother Installing Officer, I present Worshipful Master Elect for installation. GRAND MASTER OR INSTALLING OFFICER: Brother Marshal, you will place our brother at the altar, to receive the benefit of prayer and take his official obligation. The marshal will conduct the Worshipful Master Elect to the altar, cause him to kneel, facing the East. In like manner the chaplain is conducted to the altar, where he kneels, facing the west. The brethren are called up and the chaplain offers the following: PRAYER. Most Holy and Glorious Lord God, we approach Thee with reverence, and implore Thy blessing on this brother, elected (appointed) to preside over this (new) lodge, and now prostrate before Thee.

The Grand Chaplain will rise and return to his station; the Master Elect still kneeling at the altar. The installing officer, standing in the East, says: Brother You will repeat after me your official obligation: I solemnly promise, on the honor of a Mason, that in the office of Worshipful Master of Lodge, No , I will, to the best of my ability, strictly comply with the constitution, by-laws and regulations of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Illinois, the by-laws of Lodge, No , and all other ancient Masonic usages, so far as the same shall come to my knowledge.

By immemorial usage and the established landmarks of F’reemasonry you are to be installed as \\‘Vorshipful Master of this lodge, with powers and prerogatives which are of high importance and due solemnity. The good resolutions which I doubt not you have formed in your own mind that these powers shall not be abused or perverted by you I would gladly strengthen by a \\vord of admonition. The very consciousness of the possession of a great power will ever make a generous mind cau - tious arid gentle in its exercise. To rule has been the ~ot of many, and requires neither strength of intellect nor soundness of judgment; to rule WELL has been the fortune of but few, and may well be the object of an honorable ambition. It is not by the strong arm or the iron will that obedience and order—the chief requisites of good government—are secured, but by holding the key to the hearts of men. The office of Master is of great antiquity and respect, and is one of the highest dignities to which we may aspire. Its incumbent, to rule well, should possess and practice several important requisites As a MAN, he should be of approved integrity arid irreproachable morals, freed from the dominion of hasty temper and ill-governed passions, of good repute in the world, and practicing, as an example to his brethren, the cardinal virtues of TEMPERANCE, FORTITUDE, PRUDENCE and JUSTICE. As a CITIZEN, he should be loyal to his govern - ment, obedient to its laws, prompt in the duties he owes to society, and a pattern of fidelity in all social and domestic relations. As a MASON, he should cling to the old land - marks, and be sternly opposed to their infringement; be desirous to learn and apt to teach; be prompt to aid and relieve, and be ever mindful that, though elevated for a time above his fellows, he is elevated by them, and should therefore cultivate, everywhere and at all times, the golden tenets of BROTHERLX LOVE, RELIEF and TRUTH. As an OFFIcER, he should remember, first of all, that he is an individual Mason, sharing in that respect a common lot with his brethren, and there - fore interested in the welfare of each and all; be devoid of undue ostentation and haughty overbear - ing; be accessible to all, cultivating the closest friendship and the most unlimited confidence with his associate officers; be eager to take counsel with"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"cEREMONIALs 40 INSTALLATION OF O~ICERS 4’ his brethren and ready to give it; be ready to reward good; be devoid of favoritism, and wholly impartial.

The Worshipful Master will then say: BRETHREN: We mourn today the loss of a brother whose spirit has been summoned to the land where our fathers have gone before us. Again we behold the narrow house appointed for all the liv - ing, and our thoughts turn to the silent realm where, in that peace which the world can neither give nor take away, lie the unnumbered dead. The sunshine and the storm pass over them and they are not dis - turbed. Stones and lettered monuments symbolize the love of surviving friends and convey the silent admonition, “Seek ye the narrow path and the straight gate that lead unto eternal life.” Again we are called upon to consider the uncertainty of human life, the absolute certainty of death, and the vanity of earthly ambition. Change and decay are written upon every living thing. The cradle and the coffin stand side by side, and it is a melancholy truth that as soon as we begin to live that moment also we begin to die. How often the reminders of mortality cross otir path The funeral bell tolls in our ears, and the mourners go about the streets; yet how seldom do we seri - ously consider our approaching end. We go on from design to design, add hope to hope, and lay out plans for the employment of many years. The messenger of death comes when least expected, and at a moment which to us seems the meridian of our existence. What are all the externals of human dignity, the power of wealth, or the charms of beauty when nature has paid her just debt? View life stripped of its ornaments, and exposed in its natural weakness, and we see the vanity of all earthly things save those which go to the growth and perfection of individual character. In the grave all fallacies are detected, all ranks are leveled, all distinctions are done away. Here the scepter of the prince and the staff of the beggar lie side by side. Happy, indeed, is it for us—and blessed the agencies which have made it possible—that while our eyes may be dim with tears as we think of our departed brother, we may, in the sincerity of our heads, accord to his memory the commendation of having lived a useful and e,cemplary life and as a just and upright Mason And now, my brethren, let us see to it, and so regulate our lives by the plumb-line of justice, ever squaring our actions by the square of virtue, that"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"104 CEREMONIALS 105 MASONIC FUNmiAL flITtJAL when the Grand Warden of Heaven shall call for us we may be found ready.

There, placed at His right hand, He will be pleased to pronounce us just and upright Masons. In case of interment the remains will be slowly lowered into the grave.

It is an emblem of inno - cence and the badge of a Freemason. This I now deposit upon the casket. (Deposits it upon the casket.) We are reminded here of the universal dominion of death. The arm of friendship cannot interpose to prevent his coming; the wealth of the world cannot purchase exemption; nor will the innocence of youth or the charms of beauty change his purpose.

By it we are reminded that we have a life within us that shall survive the grave, and which can never die. By it we are admonished that we also, like our brother whose remains lie here before us, shall soon be clothed in the habiliments of death. Through our belief in the mercy of God we may confidently hope that our souls will bloom in eternal spring. This, too, I deposit with our deceased brother. (Drops it.)
