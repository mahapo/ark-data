THE BADGE OF A MA5ON The Lamb, in all ages, has been deemed an emblem of innocence. He, therefore, who wears the lamb-skin as the badge of a Mason is continually reminded of that purity of life and rectitude of conduct so essentially necessary to admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. In the third section we receive instruc - tion relative to the form, supports, cover - ing, furniture, ornaments, lights, and jewels of a Lodge, how it is situated, and to whom dedicated. A Lodge is a certain number of brethren, FIRST DEGREE~ 9 duly assembled, with a Holy Bible, a square and Compasses, and a Charter or Dispensation authorizing them to meet. A Charter is an instrument, emanating Crom a Grand Lodge and, in this Jurisdic - Lion, signed by the Grand Master and Grand Secretary, authorizing certain breth - rcn therein named, when duly assembled, to Initiate, Pass, and Raise all good men and true who may apply for the purpose and whom they may find worthy. A Dis - pensation is a like instrument issued by the Grand Master during the recess of the Grand Lodge, which, for a limited period, confers similar powers. Should you, being In a strange place and unknown, desire to visit a Lodge, it will be your duty to request oF the committee sent to examine you that they show you some such instrument.

The FORM of a Lodge is oblong. It ex - tends from east to ~vest and between the north and south, and it is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Ma - sonry and to teach us that a Mason’s charity should be equally extensive, for in every country and in every clime are Masons to be found. A Lodge is metaphorically said to be 5UPPOBTED by three great pillars, denomin - ated Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, it being necessary that there should be wis - dom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. These pillars are represented in the Lodge by the Worshipful Master and the Senior and Junior Wardens. The COVERING of a Lodge is no less than FIR5T DEGRER 11 tlLc clouded canopy or star-decked heaven where all good N4asons hope at last to ar - ilve by the aid of that theological ladder wi jich Jacob in his vision, saw, reaching ~rom earth to heaven, the three principal “~unds of which are denominated Faith, itope, and Charity, which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and ‘harity for all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity, for our Faith may be lost iii sight, Hope ends in fruition, but Charity lxtends beyond the grave, through the I )Oundless realms of eternity. Every well-governed Lodge is furnished with a Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God, it I icing his inestimable gift to man as the rule and guide of his faith, * * * the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and ~bc Compasses to the Craft, for, by due attention to their use, we are taught to circumscribe our desires and keep our"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl vi iiclitiiigargus.nl vi IftiltlilgLtrgus.nl vi (IL iiiingargus.nl \\\\ sticiitingargus.nl vi stichtingargus.nl vi .stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtirigargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtirigargus.nI \\v.stichtingargus.nI 12 FIRST DEGREE passions within due bounds toward all mankind. The ORNAMENTS of a Lodge are the Mo - saic Pavement, the Indented Tassel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple, and is emblematic of human life, checkered with good and evil. The Indented Tessel is a representation of the beautiful tesselated border or sl~irting which surrounded the pavement, and is emblematic of the manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, which we hope to enjoy by a faithful reliance upon Divine Providence, hieroglyphically repre - sented by the Blazing Star in the center. The LIGHTS of a Lodge are three, situ - ated in the East, West, and South. As you may observe, there is none in the North be - cause King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was situ - ated so far north of the Ecliptic that neither FIR5T DEGREE 18 the Sun nor Moon, at Meridian height, could dart its rays into the north part of the building. The North, therefore, among Masons, has always been termed a place of darkness. The JEWELS of a Lodge are six: three im - movable, and three movable. The Immov - L~ble Jewels are the Square, the Level, and the Plumb, and they are termed immovable because they are the jewels of the three principal offices of the Lodge, the Worship - fnl Master and the Senior and Junior War - dens who are always stationed in the East, West, and South. The Square denotes mor - ILlity, the Level equality, and the Plumb icctitude of life. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ash - jar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adjusted by the working-tools of the Fellow Crafts.

By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfec - tion at which we hope to arrive by a vir - tuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle Board we are reminded that, as the opera - tive workman erects his temporal building agreeable to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle Board, so should we, both operative and specula - tive endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the great book of nature and revelation which is our spiritual, moral, and Masonic Trestle Board. Lodges are situated due East and West because Moses, after having been instru - mental in conducting the children of Israel through the Red Sea when pursued by FIRST DEGREE 15 Pharaoh and his hosts, by divine command, erected a tabernacle which he placed due east and west, to commemorate the miracu - lous east wind by which their mighty de - liverance was wrought. This tabernacle was an exact model for King Solomon’s Temple, for which reason all Masonic f~odges are, or should be, situated due east ~mnd west. Lodges were anciently dedicated to King ~oIon~on, as it is said he was our first Most I~xcellent Grand Master. Lodges at the present time are dedicated to Saint John tt~o Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry; ~nd since their time there is, or should be, represented in every well-furnished Lodge IL certain point within a circle, the point cpresenting an individual brother and the (‘ircle the boundary line of his conduct beyond which he should never suffer his passions, his prejudices, or his interest, to betray him.

In traversing its circumference we necessarily touch upon the parallel lines and also upon the Holy Bible, and, while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that be can materially err. The three principal tenets of Masonry are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. BROThERLY LOVE By the exercise of Brotherly Love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family, the high and the low, the rich and the poor, who, as created by one Al - mighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and pro - tect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and causes true friendship to exist FIRST DEGREE 17 among those who might otherwise have re - mained at a perpetual distance. BELIEF To relieve the distressed is a duty incum - bent on all men, but particularly upon Ma - sons who are linked together by an indis - ~ohib]e chain of sincere affection. To sooth the unhappy, to sympathize with their mis - roitunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds is the great aim we have ~n view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish Our connections. TRUTH Truth is a divine attribute and the foun - (lation of every virtue.

I TEMPERANCE, FORTITUDE PRUDENCE, AND JUSTICE. TEMPERANCE Is that due restraint upon the affections and passions that renders the body tame and governable and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess or the contracting of any licentious or vicious r FIR5T DEGREE 19 habits, the indulgence in which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable se - crets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, which would conse - quently subject him to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons. * * * FORTITUDE Is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril, or danger, when pruden - tially deemed expedient.

He should be particularly careful, in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token, or word whereby the secrets of Freemasonry might be unlawfully obtained. * * JUSTICE Is that standard or boundary of right which enables us to render unto every man his just due, without distinction.

OF ITS ANTIQUITY From the first formation of society order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons first obliged men to con - trive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five Orders are thus classed the Tuscan, Done, Ionic, Corinthian, a n d Composite.

To these the Romans added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Done, and the Composite, which was more orna - mental, if not more beautiful, than the Cor - inthian. The first three orders alone, how - ever, show invention and particular char - acter, and essentially differ from each other, the two others having nothing but that which is borrowed, and differing only acci - dentally. The Tuscan is the Donic in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Corinthian enriched with the Ionic.

In fine, Geometry, is the foundation of architecture and the root of mathematics. *** MORAL ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY Geometry is the first and noblest of sci - ences and the basis on which the super - structure of Freemasonry is erected. By Geometry we may curiously trace nature through her various windings to her most concealed recesscs. By it we discover the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Great Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which con- SECOND DEGREE 35 nect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their respective orbits, and demonstrate their various revo - lutions. By it we account for the return of seasons and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse and are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first deter - mined man to imitate the Divine plan, and to study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies and birth to every useful art.

We also learn from the same sacred source that David, King of Israel, desired to build the house, but that, in consequence of his reign having been one of many wars and much bloodshed, that distinguished privilege was denied him. He was not, however, left without hope, for God promised him that out of his loins there should come a man who would be adequate to the performance of so great and glorious an undertaking. That promise was verified in the person and character of Solomon, his son, who ascended the throne, and, after David was gathered to his fa - thers, wielded the sceptre over Israel at a THIRD DEGREE 45 time when (as the great Jewish historian Josephus informs us) peace and tranquility pervaded the world, and all eyes seemed directed toward Jerusalem as if to witness the splendid display of the wisdom of Solomon.

The Pot of Incense Is an emblem of a pure heart, which is ahvays an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity, EMBLEMS 53 and, as is glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent Author of our existence for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. The Beehive Is an emblem of industry, and recom - mends the practice of that virtue to all cre - ated beings, from the highest seraph in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that, as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones, never sitting down contented while our fellow- creatures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them, without inconvenience to ourselves.

It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent of all other beings, but, as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, men were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for so - cial and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and un - derstanding may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society,. and unworthy of our protection as Masons.

The Forty-Seventh Problem of Euclid This was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythagoras, wlao, in his travels from Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of Priesthood and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems, and, among the most distinguished, he erected this one, which, in the joy of his heart, he called Eureka, in the Grecian language, signifying, I have found it; and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. EMBLEMS 57 The Hour Glass Is the emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close] We cannot without astonishment behold the little par - ticles which are contained in this machine, how they pass away almost imperceptibly, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man! Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow, blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth.

II. Of the Civil Magistrate, Supreme and Subordinate A Mason is a peaceable subject to the civil powers wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in plots and conspiracies against the peace and welfare of the nation, nor to behave himself un - dutifully to inferior magistrates; for as Ma - sonry hath always been injured by war, bloodshed and confusion, so ancient kings and princes have been much disposed to encourage the craftsmen, because of their peaceableness and loyalty, whereby they practically answered the cavils of their ad - versaries, and promoted the honor of the Fraternity, who ever flourished in times of peace. So that if a brother should be a rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanced in his rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man; and if convicted of no other crime, though the ANTIENT CHARGES 63 loyal Brotherhood must and ought to dis - own his rebellion, and give no umbrage or ground of political jealousy to the govern - ment for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his relation to it remain indefeasible. III. Of Lodges.

IV. Of Masters, Wardens, Fellows and Apprentices. All preferment among M a s on s is grounded upon real worth and personal merit only; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to shame, nor the Royal Graft despised: Therefore no Master or Warden is chosen by seniority, but for his merit. It is impossible to de - scribe these things in writing, and every Brother must attend in his place, and learn them in a way peculiar to this Fraternity. Only candidates may know that no Master should take an Apprentice unless he has sufficient employment For him, and unless he be a perfect youth, having 110 maim or defect in his body, that may render him uncapable of learning of the art of serving his Master’s Lord, and of being made a ANTIENT CHARGES 65 Brother, and then a Fellow Craft in due time, even after he has served such a term of years as the custom of the country di - rects; and that he should be descended of honest parents; that so, when otherwise qualified, he may arrive at the honor of being the Warden, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden and at length the Grand Master of all Lodges, according to his merit.

VI. Of Behavior, viz: 1. In the Lodge WThile Constituted.

Behavior After the Lodge Is Over and the Brethren Not Gone. You may enjoy yourself with innocent mirth, treating one another according to ability, but avoid all excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his inclina - tion, or hindering him from going wben his occasions call him, or doing or saying any - thing offensive, or that may forbid an easy and free conversation; for that would blast our harmony and defeat our laudable pur - poses. Therefore no private piques or quar - rels must be brought within the door of the ANTIENT CHARGES ‘71 Lodge, far less quarrels about religion, or nations or state policy we bring only as Ma - sons of the Catholic (universal) religion above mentioned; we are also of all na - tions, tongues, kindreds, and languages, and are resolved against all politics, as what never yet conducted to the welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This Charge has al - ways been strictly enjoined and observed; but especially ever since the reformation in Britain, or the dissent and secession of these nations from the communion of Rome. 3. Behavior When Brethren Meet Without Strangers, But Not in a Lodge Formed. You are to salute one another in a cour - teotis manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freely giving mutual instruction as shall be thought ex - pedient, without being overseen or over - heard, and without encroaching upon each other, or derogating from that resepct which is due to any Brother, were he not a"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus .nl vV. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichuirigargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl \\v ~4ticIitingargus.n1 ~ ~iiThtingargus.nl \\‘~ sticbtingargus.nl \\\\ st’chtingargus.nl ‘~x .stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl v~ .stichtingargus.nl 72 ANTIENT CHARGES Mason; for though all Masqns are as brethren upon the same level, yet Masonry takes no honor from a man that he had before; nay, rather it adds to his honor, especially if he has deserved well of the Brotherhood, who must give honor to whom it is due, and avoid ill manners. 4. Behavior in Presence of Strangers Not Masons. You should be cautious in your words and carriage, that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and sometimes you shall divert a discourse, and manage it prudently for the honor of the Worshipful Fraternity. 5. Behavior at Home, and in Your Neigh - borhood. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise man; particularly, not to let your family, friends and neighbors know the concerns of the Lodge, etc., but wisely to consult your own honor, and that of the ANTIENT CHARGES 73 Ancient Brotherhood, for reasons not to be mentioned here. You must also consult your health by not continuing together too late, or too long from home, after Lodge hours are past; and by avoiding of gluttony or drunkenness, that your families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working. 6. Behavior Toward a Strange Brother. You are cautiously to examine him, in such a method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant, false pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and derision, and beware of giving any hints of knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true arid genuine Brother, you are to respect him ac - cordingly, and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be relieved; you must employ him some days, or else recommend him to be employed.

Finally, All these Charges you are to ob - serve, and also those that shall be communi - cated to you in another way; cultivating brotherly love, the foundation and cap - stone, the cement and glory of this Ancient Fraternity, avoiding all wrangling and quarreling, all slander and backbiting, nor permitting others to slander any other Brother, but defending his character, and doing him all good offices, as far as is con - sistent with your honor and safety and no further. And if any of them do you injury, you must apply to your own or his Lodge; and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge at the Quarterly Communica - tion, and from thence to the Annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable conduct of our forefathers in every nation; never taking a legal course, but when the case cannot be otherwise decided, and pa- ANT]ENT CHARGES 75 tiently listening to the honest and friendly advice of Master and Fellows when they would prevent you going to law with strangers, or would excite you to put a speedy period to all law-suits, that so you may mind the af Fairs of Masonry with the more alacrity and success; but with respect to Brothers or Fellows at law, the Master and Brethren should kindly offer their mediation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the contending Brethren; and if that submission is impracticable, they must, however, carry on their process or lawsuit without wrath and rancor, (not in the common way) saying or doing noth - ing that may hinder brotherly love, and good offices to be renewed and continued; that all may see the benign influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the beginning of the world, and will do to the end of time. Amen. So mote it be."}]
