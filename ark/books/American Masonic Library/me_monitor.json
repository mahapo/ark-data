The Digest is entirely reset. 1942. THE COMMITTEE PREFACE For several years there has been a general call for a Digest of the Decisions of the Grand Lodge; but when I came to consider the preparation of such a work, I at once perceived that, if confined to a mere Digest of Decisions of our Grand Lodge, it would fail to meet the expectations of the Craft, and prove compai atively useless; and I became satisfied that a Digest of the Constitution and Decisions was required. Beyond this, there seemed to me to be needed, even more than the Digest, a statement of the manner of proceeding in Masonic trials; with forms, the whole so arranged that Brethren, not familiar with legal proceedings, could proceed in due form, in the undesirable but necessary work of dis - ciplining unworthy members. It was also suggested by brethren familiar with the work - ing of our lodges, that a Monitor, adapted to our ritual or work, would be of essential benefit to the Craft in Maine. For these reasons I determined to compile a Text Book which should embrace instruction for all the work and ordinary business of the lodge and the ceremonies of the Grand Lodge, and contain a Digest of the Constitution and Decisions of our Giand Lodge. I am under obligations to M W. TIMOTHY J. MU1UIA~i, Grand Lecturer, for valuable assistance in the monitorial portion of the work; to R. W. Jo~ S DERBY, for the use of a manuscript Digest of the Decisions and a part of the Constitution prepared by him; and to R. W. Iw~ BErnIY, for preparing the Index. Portland, Nov., 1877. J. H. D.

The too gi eat frequency of Masonic Processions in public is an cvii greatly to be deplored In this State no lodge can ~form a public piocession, except for funerals and attend - ance upon Divine Scm vices, without the consent of the Grand IViaster. Formeily lodges had the right to appear in public on St John’s Days. and if the ancient manner of celebrating those days should ever again prevail undoubtedly lodges would be permitted to do so without being required to obtain special permission. The rule is that Masouic processions are allowable only when sonic Masonic worlm is to be done. m But in former times Masons frequently appeared in public in their distinctive character to pay respect to the Chief Magustiate, either upon occasions of a public reception of him, om of public mourning for his death. Some have attempted to make a distinction, holding that when the Chief Magistrate is, or has been a Mason such a course us pioper, but when not it is improper. ~But an exam - ination of the Old Charges and Regulations will clearly show that there is no ground for this distinction, and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"- ~ - -,~.~i]i _ 82 MAsONic i’nocfmssioxs. thnaf they teach tine propriety of Masons, iii their clnar— acter as siuchi, huonoruuig rim Chief Magistrate while hmn~uuig, aummi mumouurnumig for hum winen micad TIne post of honor iii Masomuuc luiecessioums us in time rear.

A lodge can unite in the funeral procession of a person not a Mason, only as mourners, and not then without the express consent of the Crand Master, or Grand Lodge. When other organizations unite in the burial of a Mason, the lodge after taking charge of the body will conduct the services as if none but Masons were present. The Masonic service must be the final one, except that a religious service at the grave is permissible.

If the deceased is a member of a distant lodge, or, of no lodge, but entitled to Masonic burial, the duty devolves upon the oldest lodge in the place where he died, unless some other arrangement is made by those interested. It is the duty of the Master to see that suitable bearers are provided, but in this, as well as other respects, he should consult with the friends of the deceased. The Marshal should make himself famihiur with the route the lodge will take and with the location of the grave and the approach to it, in order that he may avoid confusion and be prompt in the movement of the procession If the deceased was a Grand os Past Grand Officer, the Grand Master should be promptly notified, in order that he may convene the Grand Lodge, if he sees fit, and he present himself, in such case, the Grand Master, or, in his absence, his representative, will conduct the burial service. The brethren should he dressed, with as much uniformity as practicable, in dark clothes, with white gloves and aprons, the Officers and Past Masters wearing their jewels’ black ci ape should be worn on the left arm, above the elbow, and a sprig of evergreen on the left breast; and the insignia ot the officers should be trimmed with black crape tied with a white ribbon; and a white lambskin npron should be placed upon the coffin. The masonic procession, upon arriving at a proper distance from the grave, should countermurch, and approach it in two lines in open order, passing from the foot to the head, where the Master takes his position, with the Chaplain on his left. Each line should form somewhat in the shape of a half. circle, extending from the Master beyond the Coot of the grave far enough to give room for the mourners always, and, if the nature of the ground allows and the attendance is large enough to require it, as fur as the services can be heard with convenience. If it is impracticable for the brethren to form in a single line within convenient distance, other lines may he formed in the reur of the first. The mourners take their places inside the circle at the foot of the grave, and the beurers on each side of it: the Deacons cross their rods over the head and the Stewards over the foot, and retain their places throughout the service. If the body is to he placed in a tomh, the coffin should be deposited a little in front of it and remain there until the ceremonies are finished: and the brethren form around the coffin in the same manner as around the grave. The custom of burying a hrother with masonic honors is ancient, but it has not heen ascertained when it originated: the early Constitutions do not mention it, but in 1742 a cancature of a Masonic funeral procession was published, and in 1754 a regulation was adopted restraining the custom. A Service was first published in 1772 by WILLIAM PBEsToN, in his “Illustrations of Masonry.” MASONIC FUNERAL SEBVlCE. CHAPLAIN:—! will lift up mine eyes unto the hiJls; from whence cometh my help?

The body of our late brother lies before us, overtaken by that relentless fate which is sooner or later to overtake us all, and which no worth or virtue, no wealth or honor, no tears of friends and loving ones can avert or delay, teach - ing us the impressive lesson, continually repeated, yet always soon forgotten, that ere long everyone of us must follow in his way. Very eloquent, my brethren, are the pale, still lips of the dead! With a pathos and impressiven&s that no living lips can equal or even approach these lips of marble preach to us sermons that cannot be translated into words Most eloquently they tell us how vain and empty are all hatreds, jealousies, disputes and rivalries, of human life But this hody is not our brother, but that which was his material part until God laid his finger on him and he slept.

We shall no more hear his voice until we shall have answered, in another world, the voice that has called him thither. In a little while, as it has happened to our brother whose memory we now horor, so will it happen to us, and we like him shall be gathered to our fathers. Let us then not forget the lessons taught us by our brother’s death; but remembering the un - certainly of ]ife and the little value of those things for which most men strive, may we the more earnestly endeavor to obey the laws of God and labor to do good to our fellow men.

This Evergreen is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. By it we are reminded there dwells within our tabernacle of clay an imperishable, immortal spirit over which the grave has no dominion and death no power. (The Master then brings his right hand to his left breast; then extends it, palm downward, over the grave (or casket if at house), depositing the Evergreen, then carries it above his head, pointing to Heaven, and then drops it to his side.) Master continues: From time immemol ial it has been the custom of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons to render services indicative of their respect for a deceased brother, their sorrow at his loss, their sympathy with his friends and their steadfast faith in a life beyond the grave. In accordance with this custom we now commit the body of our brother to its kindred dust and leave him reverently and trustingly in the hands of him who doeth all things well.

JURISPRUDENCE AND DIGEST"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIV. SOURCES OF MASONIC LAW. The law by winch thu Institution is governed is de— iived from the following sources 1. The Ancient Landmat~ks. 2. The Ancient Charges. 3. The Old Regulations. 4. The Constitution of on~ Grand Lodge. 5. The R~gu1atioiis and decisions of our Grand Lodge. G. The usages and customs of the Fraternity. T. The By-Laws of the Lodge. These classes in some instances run into each other; but this classP3cation appears to be the most simple and coiixeniciit that can be made. Various attempts have been made to enumerate the Landmarks but as no two authors agree in their enum - eration, it is safe to concLude that no one of the attempts is a success. The very definition of Landmarks shows that an enumeration of timein is scarcely possible. A Landmark is a law ot custom of the Fiaternity, that has existed “from a time whereof the memory of man runnetli not"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"a Si -I 154 SOURCES OF MASONIC LAW. to the contrary.” If a Landmark was originally enacted as a law, the time when, as weLl as the fact of the enact - ment, are not known All we can know is that it is a law or a custom that has existed from time immemorial We may be making landmarks now if any universal usage exists that has existed so long that its origin is unknown, it is a landumark It has been said that the Landmarks are the unwritten law of Masonry: but this is not correct for landmarks are found in the Ancient Charges. Indeed, the only evidence, that some customs are landmarks, is the fact that they are mentioned as such in the earliest publi - cations in relation to Freemasonry The Landmarks cannot be repealed or changed That they are souietiines infringed upon, is doubtless true But any enactment in violation of a landmark is void, by whatever authority it is made All Masons agree in this and the piactical difficulty is, that one denies that to be a landmark which another affirms is one. In order that The Ancient Landmarks, The Ancient Char ges and The Old Regulations may be accessible to all, they will be given in the succceding Chapters The law derived from the Constitution, Regulations and Decisions of the Grand Lodge, will be given only in the Digest Nor -will any attempt be made to enunmerate the usages and customs of the Fraternity, save in special cases and, of course, By-Laws of Lodges need not be herein discussed C MACKEY’S ANCIENT LANDMARKS. 155 CHAPTER XV. MACKEY’S ANCIENT LANDMARKS. (From Mackey’s Encyclopedia of Freemasonry) Until the yeai 1858, no attempt had becn made by any Masonic writer to distinctly enumerate the landmarks of Freenmasonry, and to give to them a conmprehcnsible form In October of that year, the author of this work published in the American Quarterly Review o[Freemasonry (vol ii, p. 230), an article on “The Foundations of Masonic Law,” which contained a distinct enumeration of the landmarks, which was the first time that such a list had been presented to the Fraternity This enumeration was subsequently incompom ated by the author in his 2 ext Beak of Masonic Jurisprudence It has since been very generally adopted by the Fraternity, and republished by many wiiters on Masonic law, sometimes without any acknowledgement of the source whence they derived their information According to this recapitulation, the result of much labor and research, the landmarks are twenty-five in number, and are as follows 1 The modes of recognition are, of all the landmarks, the most legitimate and unquestioned They admit of no variation; and if ever they have suffered alteration or addition, the evil of such a violation of the ancient law has always made itself subsequently manifest. 2. The division of symbolic Masonry into three degrees is a landmark that has been better preserved than almost any other; although even here the mischievious spirit of in - novation has left its traces, and, by the disruption of its con - cluding portion from the third degree, a xi ant of uniformity"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"156 MACKEY’S ANCIENT LANDMARX(S. MACKEY’S ANCIENT LANDMARKs. 157 has been created in respect to the final teaching of the Master’s Order; and the Royal Arch of England, Scotland, Ireland, and America ,and the “ high degrees “ of France and Germany, are all made to differ in the mode in which they lead the neophyte to the great consummation of all symbolic Masonry. In 1813, the Grand Lodge of England vindicated the ancient landmark, by solemnly enacting that ancient Craft Masonry consisted of the three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, including the Holy Royal Arch. But the disruption has never been healed, and the landmark, although acknowledged in its integrity by all, still con - tinues to he violated. 3. The legend of tije third degree is an important land - mark, the integrity of which has been well preserved. Theie is no rite of Masonry, practised in any country or language, in which the essential elements of this legend are not taught. The lectures may vary, and indeed are constantly changing, hut the legend has ever remained substantially the same And it is necessary that it should he so, for the legend ot the Temple Builder con~1itutes the very essence and identity of Masonry. Any rite which should exclude it, or materially alter it, would at once, by that exclusion or alteration, ceased to he a Masonic rite. 4 The government of the Fraternity by a presiding officer called a Grand Master, who is elected from the body of the Craft, is a fourth landmark of the Order. Many persons suppose that the election of the Grand Master is held in consequence of a law or regulation of the Grand Lodge. Such, however, is not the case. The office ~s in - debted for its existence to a landmark of the Order. Grand Masters, or persons performing the functions under a different but equivalent title, are to he found in the records of the Institution long before Grand Lodges were estabjished, and if the present system of legislative government by Grand Lodges were to be abolished, a Grand as er would still be necessary. 5. The prerogative of the Grand Master to preside over every assembly of the Craft, wheresoever and whensoever held, is a fifth landmark. It is in consequence of this law, derived from ancient usage, and not from any special enact - ment, that the Grand Master assumes the chair, or as it is called in England, “the throne,” at every communication of the Grand Lodge; and that he is also entitled to preside at the communication of every subordinate Lodge, where he may happen to be present. 6. The prerogative of the Grand Master to grant dis - pensations for conferring degrees at frregular times, is another and a very important landmark The statutory law of Masonry requires a month, or other determinate period, to elapse between the presentation of a petition and the election of a candidate. But the Grand Master has the power to set aside or dispense with this probation, and to allow a candidate to be initiated at once This prerogative he possessed before the enactment of the law requiring a probation, and as no statute can impair his prerogative, he still retains the power. 7. The prerogative of the Grand Master to give dispensa - tions for opening and holding Lodges is another landmark He may grant, in virtue of this, to a sufficient number of Masons, the privilege of meeting together and conferring degrees The Lodges thus established ate called “Lodges under dispensation.” 8. The pierogative of the Grand Master to make Masons at sight is a landmark which is closely connected with the preceding one. There has been much misapprehension in relation to this landmark, which misapprehension has some - times led to a denial of its existence in jurisdictions where the Grand Master was, perhaps, at the very time substantially exercising the pterogative, without the slightest remark or Opposition. 9. The necessity for Masons to congregate in Lodges is another landmark. It is not to he understood by this that any ancient landmark has directed that permanent organiza - tion of subordinate Lodges which constitutes one of the features of the Masonic system as it now prevails. But the landmarks of the Order always prescribed that Masons should, from time to time, congregate together for the purpose of either Operative or Speculative labor, and that these con - gregations should he called Lodges Formerly, these were extemporary meetings called together for special purposes, and then dissolved, the brethren departing to meet again at other times and other places, according to the necessity of circumstances.

MACKEY’S ANCIENT LANDMARKS. 159 10 The government of the Craft, when so congregated in a Lodgc, by a Master and two Wardens, is also a landmarl. A congregation of Masons meeting together undei any other government, as that, for instance, of a president and vice- president, or a chairman and suh~chairinan, would not be recognized as a Lodge The presence of a Master and two Wardens is as essential to the valid organization of a Lodge as a Warrant of constitution is at the present day. The names, of course, vaiy in diffevent languages; but the officers, their nuniber, prerogatives, and duties are everywhere identical. 11 The necessity that every Lodge, when congregated, should be duly tiled, is an importani landmark of the In - slitution which is never neglected The necessity of this law arises from the esoteric character of Masonry. The duty of guarding Ihe door, and leeping off cowans and eaves - diopj~ers, is an ancient one, which Iherefore constitutes a landmail 12 The right of every Mason to be repi eserited in all general meetings of the Craft, and to instruct his representa - lives, is a twelfth landmark Formerly these general meetings, which were usually held once a year, were called General Assemblies,” and all the Fraternity, even to the youngest Entered A~pi~ntic~, wete jjernutted to be piesent. Now they are called “Giand Lodges,” and only the Masteis and Wardens of the subordinate Lodges are summoned. But this is simply as the representatives of their members Origi - nally, each Masons represented himself, now he is represented by his officers 13. The right of every Mason lo apjjeal froiii the decision of his brethren, in Lodge convened, to the Grand Lodge or General Assembly of Masons, is a landmark highly essential to the ~reseivation of justice, and Ihe prevention of oppi es - sion N few modern Grand Lodges in adopting a regulation that the decision of subordinate Lodges, in cases of expulsion cannot be wholly set aside upon an appeal, have violated this unquestioned landmark, as well as the principles of just government. 14. The iight of every Mason to visit and sit in every regular Lodge is an unquestionable landmark of the Order. This is called “ the right of visitation.” This iight of visita - tion has always been recognized as an inherent right which inures to every Mason as he travels thiougli the world. And this is because Lodges are justly considered as only divisions for convenience of the universal Masonic family. This right may, of course, be impaired or forfeited on special occasions by various circumstances; but when admission is refused to a Mason in good standing, who knocks at the door of a Lodge as a visitor, it is to be exj~ected that some good and sufficient reason shall be furnished for this violation of what is, in general, a Masonic right, founded on the land - marks of the Ojder 15. It is a landmark of the Oider, that no visitor unknown to the brethren present, or to someone of them as a Mason, can enter a Lodge without first passing an examination according to ancient usage. Of course, if the visitor is lnown to any brother present to be a Mason in good standing, and if that brother will vouch for his qualifications, the exairilna - tion may be dispensed with, as the landmark refeis only to the cases of strangeis, who are not to be i ecognized unless after strict Irial, due examination, or lawful infoimation 16 No Lodge can interfeic in the business of another Lodge, nor give degrees to brethren who are membeis of other Lodges. This is undoubtedly an ancient landmark, founded on the gicat principles of courtesy and fraternal kindness, which are at the very foundation of oln Institution. It has been repeatedly recognized by subsequent statutory enactments of all Gi and Lodges. 17. It is a landmark that every Freemason is amenable to the laws and regulalions of the Masonic jurisdiction in which he resides, and this although he may not be a member of any Lodge. Non-affiliation, which is, in fact, in itself a Masonic offence, does not exempt a Mason from Masonic jurisdiction. 18. Certain qualifications of candidales for initiation aie derived froni a landmark of the Order. These qualifications are that he shall be a man — unmutilated, free born, and of mature age. That is to say, a woman, a cripple, or a slave, or one born in slavery, is disqualified for initiation into the rites of Masonry. Statutes, it is true, have from time to time been enacted, enforcing or explaining these principles, but the qualifications really arise froimu the very nature of the Masonic institution, and from its symbolic teachings, and have always existed as landmarls."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"160 MACKEY’S ANCIENT LANDMARKS. MACKEY’S ANCIENT LANDMARKS. 161 19. A belief in the existence of God as the Grand Architect of the Universe, is one of the most important Landmarks of the Order It has been always admitted that a denial of the existence of a Supreme and Superintending Power ms an absolute disqualification for initiation. The annals of the Order never yet have furnished or could furnish an instance in which an avowed Atheist was ever made a Mason The very initiatory ceremonies of the first degree forbid and prevent the possibility of such an occurence. 20 Subsidiary to this belief in God, as a landmark of the Order, is the belief in a resui~rection to a future life. This landmark is not so positively impressed on the candidate by exact words as the preceding, hut the doctrine is taught by very plain implication, and runs through the whole symbolism of the Order. To believe in Masonry, and not to believe in a resurrection, would be an absurd anomaly, which could only be excused by the meflection, that he who thus con - founded his belief and his skepticism was so ignorant of the meaning of both theories as to have no rational foundation for his knowledge of either. 21 It is a landmark that a “Book of the Law” shall constitute an indispensable part of the furniture of every Lodge I say, advisedly, Book of time Law, because it is not absolutely required that everywhere ~he Old and New Testa - nients shall be used. The “Book of the Law is that volume which, by the religion of the country, is believed to contmn the revealed will of the Grand Architect of the Universe 1-lence, in all Lodges in Christian countries, the “Book of the Law “ is com osed of the Old and New Testaments; in a country where ~ud aism was the prevailing faith, the Old Testament alone would be suifficient; and in Mohammedan countries, and among Mohammedan Masons, the Koran might be substituted Masonry does not attempt to interfere with the peculiar religious faith of its disciples, except so far as relates to the belief in the existence of God, and what necessarily results from that belief The “Book of Law” is to the Speculative Mason his spiritual trestle-board; without this he cannot labor; whatever he believes to be the revealed will of the Grand Architect constitutes for him this spiritual trestle-board, and must ever be before him in his hours of speculative labor, to be the rule and guide of his conduct. The landmark, therefore, requires that a “Book of the Law,” a religious code of some kind, purporting to he an exemplar of the revealed will of God, shall form an essential part of the furniture of every Lodge. 22. The equality of all Masons is another landmark of the Order. This equality has no reference to any subversion of those gradations of rank which have been instituted by the usages of society. The monarch, the nobleman, or the gentle - man is entitled to all the influence, and receives all the respect, which rightly belong to his position. But the doctrine of Masonic equality imples that, as children of one great Father, we meet in the Lodge upon the level — that on that level we are all traxeling to one pi~edestined goal — that ~n the Lodge genuine merit shall receive more respect than boundless wealth, and that virtue and knowledge alone should be the basis of all Masonic honors, and be rewarded with preferment. When the labors of the Lodge are orer, and the brethren have retired from their peaceful retreat, to mingle once more with the world, each will then again resume that social position, and exercise the privileges of that rank, ‘to which the customs of society entitle him. 23. The secrecy of the Institution is another and most important landmark. The form of secrecy is a form inherent in it, existing with it from its very foundation, and secured to it by its ancient landmarks. If divested of its>secret character, it would lose its identity, and would cease to be Freemasonry. Whatever objections may, therefore, be made to the Institution on account of its secrecy, and however much some unskilful brethren have been unwilling in times of trial, for the sake of expediency, to divest it of its lecret character, it will be ever impossible to do so, even where the landmark not standing before us as an insurmountable obstacle; because such change of its character would be social suicide, and the death of the Order would follow its legalized exposure. Freemasonry, as a secret association, has lived unchanged for centuries; as an open society, it would not last for as many years. 24. The foundation of a speculative science upon an operative art, and the symbolic use and explanation of the terms of that art, for the purposes of religious or moral teach - ing constitute another landmark of the Order. The Temple of Solomon was the symbolic cradle of the Institution, and therefore, the reference to the Operative masonry which con - structed that magnificent edifice, to the materials and imple - ments which were employed in its construction, and to the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"n 162 MACKEY’S ANCIENT LANDMARKS. artists who were engaged in the building, are all component and essential parts of the body of Free masonry, which could not be subtracted from it without an entire destruction of the whole identity of the Order. Hence, all the comparatively modern rites of Masoury, however they may differ in other respects, religiously preserve this Temple history and these operative elements, as the substratum of all their modifica - tions of the Masonic system. 25. The last and crowning landmark of all is, that these landmarks can never be changed. Nothing can be sub - tracted from them — nothing can be added to them, — not the slightest modifications can be made in them. As they were received from our predecessors, we are bound by the most solem obligations of duty to transmit them to our successors THE ANCIENT cHANGES. 163 CHAPTER XVI THE ANCIENT CHARGES. The collection gemierally known as “The Ancient Charges” is thc one presented to the Grand Lodge of Eimglaimd in 1721, approved by it in 1722, and published in 1723, in “Anderson’s Constitutions.” By most, these charges are esteenmeci to be landmarhs, and tlrey certainly come witlrmu the definition of the term. They are six in number, amid set forth in general terms the primicildes of Masonry and tIme obligations of a Mason in respect to God and Religion, to the Civil Ma~istrafe a to tIme Lodge, to those in official position, to tIme Craft, to the family and to the community.

A belief iii God, time Creator and F’atlier, is indispensa - bly requisite in a candidate for the honors of Masonry. An attempt has been made in Framice to modify this Landmark: it has not succeeded and when any Body, calling itself masonic, adopts any other rule, it thereby andl at once puts itself outside the pale of Masonry. Attempts have also been made in the opposite diree - tmon. In Prussia, Israelites have been excluded.

A Mason is a peaceable subject to the civil powers wherever he resides or works, and is nocer to be con - cerned in plots and conspiracies against the peace and welfare of time nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to infermor magistrates ; for as Masonry hath been always injured by war, bloodshed and confusion, so ancient Idmugs and princes have been much disposed to encourage the Craftsmen because of their peaceableness and loyalty, where] iv they practically answered the cavds of their adversarres, and promoted the honor of the Fraternity, who ever flourished in times of peace. So that if a Brother ~uhould be a rebel against the State, he is not to be countenancedi mmv his rebellion, however he may be pitiedi as an unhappy man ; and, if comivietedl of mio other crimne, though the loyal lirotimerhood must and ought to (lisown his rebelhiomi, amid give mm umbrage or ground of political jealousy to the government for the time being, they cannot erpel him from the lodge, andl his relation to it remains indefeasible The laws of Masonry are subordinate to the civil law. Whenever one’s duties as a Mason conflict with his dirities as a citizen, time latter arc paramount inul the former must yield So well is this understood amid primeticed, that the encnmies of tire institution have been able to discover, in all its history, but one or two instances in which this piinci 1 dc has beeir violatedi.

The dluty of affiliation is herein onjemneil. Bat as the language is, “every Brother ought to belong” to a lodge, and not “every Brother must belomig” to one, it is clear that whule affiliation is made a ditty, it is not made a necessity, and, therefore, a Mason, not a member of a lodge, may be in good standing amimi emititleil to ice - ogirition It follows, that those Grand Lodges, which make membership necessary for recognition as a NIason, have undertaken to modify this “ Ancient Charge ~ The regulations of the Grand Lodige of M~miire avoid this, audi the qmiestiom whether it has imnilertakeim to change a handniaihc does irot arise.

Every Brother should belong to some particular lodge, and cannot be absent without incurring censure, if not necessarily detained The men made Masons must be free-born (or no bond- men), of mature age and of good report, hale and sound, not deformed or dismembered at the time of their inak - ing Bnt no woman, no eunuch.

Experience has shown that Masons do not always obey the laws of the Institution, and that it sometimes becomes necessary to inflict punishment on that account. I.— MASONIC OFFENSES. Evem y violation of the laws of Masonry is an offense, for which the Mason corranitung it may be punished. The Masonic law requires us to obey the moral law; the laws of our country; the Constitution, Regulations and well estab - lished customs of the Fraternity; and to keep our obliga - tions• hence a violation of any of these is a Masonic offense. While Masonry requires a belief in God and Obedien~e to the moral law, in other respects it leaves its members freedom in their religious opinions Themefore, while it would cut off a member who does not believe in God or who does not obey the moral law, it takes no notice of ecclesiastical offenses. Also, while it enjoins obedience to the civil law, it will not take cognizance of offenses against the civil law that are of a political character So Treason, the highest offense known to the civil law, cannot be punished as a Masonic offense Thei e ate also certain other offenses against the civil law which are not Masonic crimes; when an act, pro - hibited by statute, involves no moral turpitude, it cannot ordinarily be punished as a Masonic offense; but when an"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"MASONIC OFFENCES. act is prohibited by statute, as being against good public morals, or as dangerous to the life, health and good order of the community, it is an offense against Masonic law. Nor does Masonry undertake to enforce contracts between its members, or collect debts. It is not an offense, for which a Mason can be punished, to insist upon his legal rights against a brother, even if so doing is against what seems to be justice in a particular case But if deceit or fraud enters into the transaction, that may be punished; but the dis - tinction must be observed between fraud or deceit and the mere breach of the contract. - II.— PENAL JURISDICTION OF THE LODGE Every Lodge shall have original juriadictior, except as otherwise provided, to entertain proceedings against a member thereof, and should take cognizance of Masonic offenses cominitted within their territorial jurisdiction by any brother, except members of lodges having concurrent juris - diction Cons. 115-C-) See Cons. 46, 47, 48, 49 for exceptions to lodge jurisdiction. III.— PROCEDURE. Whenever a brother shall be accused of any offense which, if proved, might subject him to expulsion or suspension from the rights and privileges of Masonry, the proceedings in the premises shall be conducted agreeably to the following rules: 1. The accusation shall be made in writing, with speci. fincations of the offense, under the signature of one or more Master Masons, and delivered to the Master, who shall thereupon summon his Lodge to act upon the accusation. Cons. Ii 5-(4) (a) MASONIC OFFENCES. 201 2. Specifications in which the offense is alleged must be set out with a reasonable degree of precision and certainty; but the strictness of proceedings in criminal courts of law is not required. The aim must be to ascertain the true facts relevant to, and concerning, the matter of the charges, without going into hearsay, irrelevant or immaterial matters, or such as would be clearly incompetent; and it shall not be permissihle to impeach a witness upon such trial, as by allow - ing another witness to testify that he would not believe him under oath, or that his reputation for truth and veracity is bad. ii Only one offense can be set out in one specification. If the accused is to be charged with more than one offense, specifications coveuing each Masonic offense must he separate - ly set forth 4. Specifications of charges should not contain statements of law or evidence, but only the fa~ts which it is alleged constitute a Masonic offense, and upon which evidence will be submitted at a hearing thereof. 5. Each specification should charge that the act com - planed of was done at a specified time and place; but it is not necessary to prove the time and place precisely as alleged, unless it enters into the identity of, or is an essential element in the offense. For example, an act alleged to have been committed on the first day of February may be shown to have been committed on the first day of January, and the charge he sustained; but if it should b shown that the party became a Mason after the first day of January, the date generally becomes essential, and the charge is not proved 6. If the charge involves matter not proper to be written, it shouid be so stated, and the accused, at the time of his arraignment, should be orally informed of the specific facts, to which the trail must be confined The most frequent defect in specifications of charges is that they are not suihlciently specific.

You were reqoested on 19 , and 19 to pay them and as yet no payment has been made Your failure to liquidate your indebtedness to the Lodge readers you liable to suspension from, or deprivation of, membership as the Lodge after due trial may decide I have regretfully to notify you that you are hereby cited to appear at a com - munication of the I..odge to be held on the day of A D 19 , at o’clock in the evening, to show cause, if any you have, why you should not be dealt with for your default Dated this dayof A n.19 By order of the Worshipfal Master. Attest: (L.S) Secretary. Payment of the amount of your indebtedness before the time cited for your appearance before the Lodge to answer the charge of default will void this notice The service of this notice and the proof thereof shall be in the following form I . secretary of Lodge, hereby certify that I served the original of the notice ordered to be served on Brother , by enclosing the same in an envelope addressed to him at his last known place of address, and delivering said envelope to the pastmaster at for registration with postage paid, on 19 proceed to determine the cases. The Secretary reads the charge, and the name of the Brother first on the list who has had proper notice as shown by his certificate on tile, and states how long he is in arrears The Master calls upon the delinquent, or, in his absence, upon the Brethren, to state if there is any cause why the penalty should not be inflicted Payment of the dues is, of course, good cause, and for reasons satisfactory to itself, the lodge may remit all or a part of the dues, or give further time for payment; or it may suspend the delinquent from membership, or deprive him of it, as appears for the best interests of the Lodge and the Fraternity. A majority vote of the members present is necessary to suspend from, or deprive a Brother from membership. If action upon the delinquency of a Brother is postponed until a later communication of the lodge the formality of a new notice citing him to appear need not be made, but he should be infornially advised of the postponement Any action suspending from or depriving a Brother of membership in a 1.ndge, without proper notice having been served upon him, when his address was on file, is void, and it will be the duty of the Master to order his name restored to the rolls, without a petition or vote. The question has been raised whether the delinquent has the right, by a partial payment of the amount overdue, to save forfeiting his membership; and while it has not been decided by the Grand Lodge, the better opinion seems to be that before the filing of the charges in the Lodge he may do so, but afterwards he cannot without the permission thereof. Action as to partial payment of arrearages, however, is wholly within the discretion of the lodge. A Brother suspended or deprived of membership for the non-payment of dues may appeal to the Grand Lodge, but such appeal is limited to reversing the decision of the lodge on irregular procedure, or for errors in matters of law Secretary~ At the communication stated in the notice, the lodge should determine whether sufficient notice had been given, and then"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"214 MASONIC OFFENCES.

When a lodge receives the petition of a resident within the jurisdiction of another lodge and asks a waiver of juris - diction frop such lodge, but without waiting for a reply proceeds to act upon the petition and rejects the candidate, its action is null and void. 1889, p. 334; 1890, p. 917. 22. A lodge can take a candidate into the jurisdiction of another lodge to confer a degree upon him only by the permission of the Grand Master. 1895, p. 176; 1896, pp. 57, 72; 1897, p. 230. 23. The refusal to waive jurisdiction over a candidate leaves him in the precise condition in which he would have been if he had not made the request. 1880, p. 298. 24. When one of two lodges having concurrent juris - diction has refused a request for a waiver, application cannot he made to the other lodge for a waiv~r over the same candi - date. 1908, p 23. 25. If an applicant whose petition has been received and accepted under a waiver of jurisdiction fail to take the degrees within one year, arid applies a second time to the same lodge, a second waiver is unnecessary if the applicant is still undei the jurisdiction of the lodge granting the waiver. If at the time of the second application, the candidate is ander jurisdiction of a lodge other than the one granting the waiver, this decision will not apply. 1901, p. 198. 26. An applicant, having been rejected by one of two lodges which have concurrent jurisdiction, and wishing after five years’ residence in the same jurisdiction to apply to the other lodge, needs no waiver from the lodge rejecting him. 1903, p. 217. 27.

When a proposition to consolidate a lodge with another is made therein, the Worshipful Master shall cause the matter to be laid over to a future meeting, and special notice given to the members of the lodge that the matter will come before the lodge at that meeting for action. [I. If the lodge vote to consolidate, with not exceeding six votes in the negative, the measure shall be deemed to be carried. III. Concurrent action must be taken in the other lodge, at a meeting notified for the purpose, in the same manner and adopted by the same vote IV If both lodges vote to consolidate, the proceedings shall be certified by each lodge to the M. W. Grand Master for examination. V. If he find that the proceedings of the lodges in accord - ance with these provisions, the lodges may he consolidated under the name which may be selected. VI.

A Masonic Title is a personal one which attaches to a brother by virtue of his having acquired an office in a lodge, or the Grand Lodge, and of which he is not divested when his term of office expires. MASTEn. 1. The powers of the Master of a Lodge are much different from those exercised by the head of any other society The presiding officer of most societies is chosen by the members of the organization, and can usually be removed by that body. A Master is elected by his Lodge, but can only be removed by the Grand Master or Grand Lodge. The presid - ing officers of other organizations are usually bound by certain rules of order, and a code of by-laws. A Lodge cannot enact by-laws to alter, amend, or curtail the powers of a [Waster. While lodges have by-laws they cannot in any way infringe upon the ancient prerogatives and powers of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"MASTER. 298 the Master of a Lodge v~hieh are derived from the old charges and the ancient usages of the order.

To appoint all committees A lodge may not appoint a committee, it may, however, pass a resolution that a committee be appointed, but the selection of the membership of the committee is an inherent right of the Master. 7. To appoint the appointive officers of his lodge. 8. To be ex-offlcio a member of all committees he appoints IL. A MASTER’S LIMITATIONS ARE: 1. That he cannot pay out any of the funds of the lodge without authority granted by a vote of the lodge. 2. That he should not sign a petition for a new lodge. 3. That he may not accept a petition or confer a degree without the consent of the lodge 4. A Master can only be suspended by the Grand Master or Grand Lodge.
