I have found this situation true elsewhere when facts versus fable are given an airing. It is an amazing thing that ordeis of Freemasonry, built on alle - gory, are not satisfied with this situation but fabricate “histories” pur - porting to show them years or hundreds of years older than they are. The Rosicnzcian Society, the Knights Templar, the Shrine, the Memphis Rite, and others have been guilty of such fabrications. A whole tribe of writers, starting with Anderson who wrote the 1723 and 1738 Con - stitutions of Freexnasoniy, have published books hying to tell us (they cannot prove it so no documcntation is ever given) that Freemasonry came from various sources, even back to Adam. Just why an order is better by adding years to its age and/or connecting it up with his - torical or allegorical happenings with which it really had no connec - tion, when we as a fraternity dote on TRUTH, I cannot say. The Order of the Red Cross is sufficient title to cover the sublect of this work. It has nothing whatever ~o do with Constantine or of Rome, and was started in England, circa 1865, by William VVentworth Little. It has none of the historical background attributed to it by him and no one has ever produced any proof of a previous existence of a Red Cross of Constantine or Rome in connection with the present Order. Little’s sketch is purely a fabricated affair, done by using minutes of another body, among other things, and has been copied dozens of times by high ranking officials of our Order, mostly in 1870-1875, and has come to be believed. No one, but Warvelle, ever questioned it, and he substantiated nothing, but could not disprove it, so he decided to accept it. I do not, and herein explain my reasons in the early chap - ters. From the time of the start of the Order, circa 1865, down to now, there has never been a work written covering the activities of the Order, especially in the United States where a dozen or more Sovereign or Grand Councils have existed. I have covexed all of these bodies in enough detail to give an authentic picture of the whole. The eaily Proceedings are often rare and frequently contain obvious errors. I U’"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"spent two years in obtaining the information which shows the Con - claves chartered by England alone, and about the same time unravel - ling the problem of where the Conclaves which made up the various State Conclaves in the United States came ftom. This information (complete) appears here for the first time anywhere. Many of the membership statistics have been assembled at an expense of hours of labor, compiled from meager and sometimes outside sources. For the first time I present an up-to-date list of the membership. The seal illustrations probably have never been seen by but a few of our members and I doubt if anyone ever saw them all before. I hope this work will be received in the spirit in which it has been compiled — as a one-place reference for historians and others. I have simply tried to give a truthful, documented account of the Order and if I have disillusioned some, I am sorry, for this is not my purpose. My purpose is truth and I hope that readers will hold judgment until the final page is reached. The work in England, at my request, was undertaken by trained and acknowledged Masonic historians of international repute. They worked “on the ground” where the Order was started. I am responsible for all of the American portions. H~ow V. B. Vooiuns March, 1961 PREFACE A great deal of so-called history of Masonic organizations is replete with legend and some of the material is subject to revision. The Order of the Red Cross of Coristan tine is no exception. It is not my purpose to tamper with the legends of the Order, or even discuss them, unless they are presented as history. As a Past Sovereign of the Order, I have no illusions concerning the character of Constantine any more than I have of Solomon as depicted in the Books of Kings and Samuel (rather than the Book of Chronicles, fiom whence we gather our legends of Masonry) wherein he is demoted to the level of the most despised of oriental despots. I am a follower of neither. I simply subscribe to the propagated legends for the lessons they teach. One of the strangest things concerning the spread of The Order of the Red Cross of Constantine is not only the rapidity with which it took root in England, but elsewhere. In approximately ten years (to the end of 1876) one hundred and thirty-six Conclaves had been chartered or 62% of all chartered to date (1961)—some 220 Conclaves. Of these first 136 Conclaves, 66% were outside of England, viz: U.S.A.—A8; India—i 4 ; Canada—i 3 ; New Zealand— 5 ; Scotland—6; South Africa—2; Ireland and Gibraltar— i each (35% in the U.S.A. alone). In Canada, Scotland and the United States these Conclaves set up Grand Councils and although Canada’s Grand Council was short- lived, they later started the present Grand Council. The Grand Coun - cils started in the United States were, for the most part, short-lived also. The details will be found in the text. No other chivalric order of Knighthood had such a fast growth. In spite of the fact that the numerical status of each Conclave was very limited, the growth continued. It is true that Templary in the United States grew fast also, but it was not hampered by a limited membership and is organized on an entirely different plane. In ‘935, Charles E. Chalmers, Past Grand Sovereign of the Grand Imperial Council of Pennsylvania, published a brochure titled Histori - cal Sketch of the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine. The title is a mis-nomer as practically nothing but mention is made of the lar - gest Empire or Grand Councfl then in the United States. Six pages are devoted to New York State. The first twelve pages repeat the mater- Iv V"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ial circulated previously by others and copied from the first printed “History” by XVilliam ‘Wentworth Little, most of which is fable. To correct an incidental error in this brochure on page i 7 —the Grand Couticil of New York met in Geological Hall, Albany, New York, not “Masonic Temple, in New York City.” In 194~, Edward A. Glad, Grand Recorder of “The Empire of the XVest,” issused a twenty-four page brochure titled W’hat Is The Red Cross of Constantine? The first eighteen pages are based on the W’illiam Wentworth Little material—the rest an up-to-date listing of the numbeis of active Couclaves of the World by Ray V. Denslow, Past Grand Sovereign. An incidental error in this brochure refers to “Walter Rodwell Wright.” This should read “Wallet Rodwell Wright.” In July, 1955, a third edition of Glad’s pamphlet was issued. A number of illustrations and pertinent information were added, making the first section forty pages. The final eighty pages cover biographical material on the Past Grand Sovereigns with their pictures, making a total of a hundred and twenty pages. These biographies are a most valuable contribution to the history of the Order. We pause to con - gratulate Knight Companion Glad on his industry and this accomplish- ment. No effort seems to have been made to make any research in Eng - land regarding the authenticity of the material presented. The results of such a research prompted the writer to present his findings with the idea of showing what really is known that can be documented. CONTENTS Foreword rn Pref ace v r.

This article is so much wishful thinking. Like most of such ‘histories” it is undocumented. There is some justification for the statement about the retired British officer living in Charleston at this time, however. It probably refers to Major Charles Shirreff, about whom we will write elsewhere. To show how far from the truth these statements can get, even the most rabid proponents of the early existence of a Grand Body in England never taI~ e it back beyond 1788. In fact, there never was a Grand Body of the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine until after the middle of the next century anywhere (of course I am referring to a Masonic Body). 7.

Thus, we conclude that it was NOT the Red Cross of Rome and/or Constantine degree or order being con - ferred. It was probably similar to the Red Cross of Babylon, but we are not concerned with surndses here. However, the matter was well taken up by Alfted Creigh of Pennsylvania in his History of Knights Templar of the State of Pennsylvania and is quoted in Scully’s history (see reference No. i). Creigh concludes that the various Knighthoods conferred, 1783-1805, etc., were not the Red Cross of Constantine. It seems preposterous to connect these Red Cross Knights with the Red Cross of Constantine for another reason: When the Knights Templar groups became organized bodies, the Red Cross groups (where such were actually formed), were absorbed by the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar through the Grand Commanderies. If they had been Red Cross of Constantine bodies it surely seems incongruous that when the Red Cross of Constantine Grand Councils and Conclaves were formed in the United States, 1869-1880, that the Grand Encamp - ment did not object, but nothing of the sort transpired. Some strange things face the historian when trying to show what happened during the lifetime of a Masonic Body. This logical situa - tion was not to continue with the Grand Encampment of the U. S. A. In 1935, that body was asked if there would be any objection to set - ting up Councils of Knights of the Sword, Knights of the East and Knights of the East and West in the United States. All these degrees were then controlled by the Grand Council of Knight Masons of Ire - land. The reply was “assuming that it does not relate to things Tem - plar,” they saw no reason why Councils of the “Green Degrees” could not be started in the United States. The Knight of the Sword is really the old Knight of the Red Cross of Babylon. Of course, it does not relate to things Templar but the Grand Encampment does control the Knight of the Red Cross of Babylon degree, once called “Red Cross Masons” in Ireland before the name was changed to that now used, in 1836. In 1923, these degrees (having been nearly dormant for over eighty years) under control or in captivity of the Order of Knights Templar (Great Priory of Ireland), and the “holders” granting permission by relinquishing their control of them, they became the “Knight Masons” or the “Green Degrees.” These are the degrees being given in Councils now operating in the United States under the 4 Grand Council in Dublin, Ireland, since May i6, 1936, with nine Councils in six. states. I conclude this section by noting that in the revision of the Con - stitution of the Grand Encampment of the United States in 1895, the name “Companion of the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross” was substituted for “Knight of the Red Cross.” 2. PRE-i86 5 CLAIMS In 1916, George W. Warvelle, K.G.C., Past Grand Sovereign of the Red Cross of Constantine for the United States of America, pub - lished a 23 page brochure (second edition) titled An inquiry Respect - ing the Derivation and Legitimacy of the Constantinian Orders of Knighthood. The brochure contains what might well be termed a critical inquiry into the Pre-i 7 88 claims and an examination of the claims, 1788-1865, plus a later 1871 claim. Knight Companion Warvelle, known personally to the writer, was a prominent Illinois Freemason, whose ability as an authority on Mason - ic Knighthoods was not exceeded in his day. He covered the matters relating to the legends and so-called history of the Order in extreme detail—interspersed with his comments thereon. One might expect him to be prejudiced in favor of the published “pronounciamentos” of the Order. Instead, he exhibited the results of his findings without fear or favor. It is unfortunate that some of his successors have not heeded his example, especially those who continue to put forth the old allegorical material in the guise of history. The brochure is divided into ten parts. The first six parts cover early knighthoods. Part seven and a single paragraph in part eight cover the Abbe Guistiniani derivation. The rest of part eight takes up the Major Charles Shirreff derivation. All these are derivations ex - pounded by Little in i868. Part nine covers the Baron Hunde deriva - tion added by Little in 1871, which we will discuss in the 1865-1961 period. In the final part are Warvelle’s conclusions—quite acceptable arguments in favor of non-beliefs, but he negates his arguments by saying that we have been unable to disprove the claims advanced by Little as the source of our Order. That is true about most, if not all, the “historical legend” of Freemasonry, and there seems to be no basis for really believing it. Such a negative approach to an historical inquiry is not exactly a novelty, but it is surely illogical logic, to coin a phrase."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The first “avenue” which is examined is the Abbe Guistiniani derivation. This individual is supposed to have admitted candidates to the lesser or novitiate (red) Cross. No one seems to have explained, so far as I have seen, just how these Novitiates were able to form a Grand Body and become “Knights” or “Grand Crosses” of the Order, when none was so elevated. I Lonsider this nothing but un adulterated legend—for that is all it is—and untenable. To show just how some of the writers made up fables about the Red Cross of Constantine, this example will suffice: In The History of Freemasonry by Albeit Gallatin Mackey (Singleton Edition, 1898, Vol V, page 1317): it is stated that Guistiniani, while visiting Eng - land in May, 1692, conferred the Red Cross of Constantine on several attaches of the English court. That in September, 1699, the Duke of Parma (Francis I) was installed Grand Master of the Knights of the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine. That in January, 1760, the Grand Masters of the English and Scottish Knights of the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine assembled in London, and adopted a re - quirement for Knighthood in the Order that the applicant be a Royal Arch Mason and a believer in the Christian religion. It would be in - teresting to know who these Grand Masters were—in fact to even learn about the Grand Bodies over which they supposedly presided— and how many Royal Arch Masons there were in the world in 1760. In the second half of the i8th century there are many articles found in the Proceedings of the various Red Cross of Constantine groups in the United States. They are full of “wishful thinking” but exhibited as “history.” It is amazing how much these Knights knew about the history, although they had been members so few years. 3. ENGLAND From about i86o to 1875, a number of Masonic and allied bodies were started, resuscitated or activated in England. Most of them were given activity through the efforts of Robert Wentworth Little and a group of men then prominent in Masonic circles. The names of Lord Kenlis (The Earl of Bective), The Earl of Jersey, Frederick Martin Williams, Francis Burdett, William James 1-lughan, William Henry 1-lubbard, William Robert Woodman, Sigismund Rosenthal and Henry C. Levander, are found in top offices in The Red Cross of Constantine, with its Imperial Council, Grand Senate, College of Viceroys and Ap - pended Knights of the Holy Sepulchre; the Rosicrucian Society; the Rite of Mizraim; the Cryptic Rite; the Druids; the Order of St. Law - rence, and others. Some of these brethren were active in Symbolic Masonry, Capitular Masonry, Chivalric Masonry and in the thirty year old Ancient and Accepted Rite. Lord Kenlis (Thomas Taylour) headed so many of these bodies that a number of subordinate groups bore his name—even some char - tered in other countries by the British parent bodies. This resuscitation or activating was similar to a like situation in the United States in the 1930’s. From an historical viewpoint the resuscitation of the Red Cross of Constantine falls to the ground. It appears more to be a conscious effort on the part of the chronicler of the Order (Little) to place its roots beyond provable reach and then to pick up records of a group long since dormant for an intermediary existence. Added to this is a coating, seemingly added to glorify the Order that it might be placed on par with the Knights Templar and thought, therefore, to be one of the “degrees of the Orders of Chivalry” generally approved at the union of the two Grand Lodges of England in 1813. There is nothing unique or even new in this sort of chicanery in Masonic Orders. Even at our entrance into Masonry we are faced with the often repeated interpolation of the caution “Masonic legend infoims us.” It is not our purpose to disavow non-historical elements in legend. This would mar its beauty and blur its sublime content. It is our contention, however, that when the history is expounded, that it should be su~cient to tell the truth about the erection of an Order, rather than basing the history on legend. If the legend is useful, its story and lessons would survive. I am convinced that the legend of the Red Cross of Constantine would so survive as a basis for the Order even if its advent was, as it surely is, in the year 1865. The Masonic Rosicrucian Society came into being, and by the same “resuscitation” process, about the same time as the Red Cross of Constantine, and was also under the guiding hand of Robert Went- worth Little. Unlike the former, which has but few scraps of evidence showing definite existence prior to i86o, the Red Cross of Constantine Order has a congeries of material from which it is claimed that it proves an existence as early as 1788. From that date to i 86~, a period of nearly eighty years, when the Order was “resuscitated” we are depen - dent on A Sketch of the History and Records of the Order of Con- 6 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"stantine, which comprises about half of the official promulgated Gen - eral Statutes of the Imperial, Ecclesiastical and Military Order of Knights of the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine and the Laws of” the K.HS., London, i868, by Sir Knight Robert Wentworth Little, Grand Recorder. It is our purpose to make an exegesis of the statements made by Robert Wentworth Little, so far as he has set down dates and places —even spending a little time on the statement he repudiated in 1871 by official proclamation, in which the name of the Order was changed and another even more preposterous genealogy “overlooked” three years previously, was announced. I trust that this will be the last time this material is ever exhibited as an historical background of our Order. For that ieason I have done my best to place it in a more readable condition as an exhibit. In a number of instances the names shown in the original merely have initials—and in some instances not even initials. They have been iden - tified, in most cases and I have added their full names. Little seems to have made no effort to find out who these men were in his appar - ent haste to get the material in print. Of course, he could fall back on the fact that these are verbatim records—but in the interest of identi - fication he might have given some time and attention to those about whom he made so much fuss as “historical ancestors.” Extracts from the Sketch of Little Sometime in 1788, one Major Charles Shirreff of ‘Whitchurch, Salop, (Shropshire), admitted to the Order the following Brethren: i—james Heseltine —Grand Treasurer & Past G. Sec’y of G. L. 2—William White Grand Secretary of G. L. 3—john Allen Prov. G.M.—Lancaster 4—James Galloway Past J. G. Warden s—George Sweetinbourg Ass’t Grand Secretary These are the same brethren who were, on May 6, 1788, given a warrant for a Lodge of Perfection, 140 by Major Shirreff. The next date is 1790, when Thomas Dunckerley is mentioned as head of the Order, and then in 1796, Lord Rancliffe, Grand Master of the Templars, is mentioned as Grand Master. In 180± Wailer Rod- well Wright, Prov. Grand Master for the lonian Islands, is named as Grand Master—and soon afterward Prince Edward, Duke of Kent is recorded as the Grand Royal Patron. 8 The First so-called records are dated May ± i8o8—when a Consti - tution and set of laws was confirmed, and a High Council was elected for a seven year term and officers for three years. The full complement of officers is not at hand, but the following appear to have been the Nine Grand Crosses: Wailer Rodwell Wright Grand Mailer Richard Jebb Grand Chancellor John Christian Burckhardt Grand Marsha! Frederic Perkins Grand Herald Okey Beffour Grand Herald Thomas Peyton Slapp Rev. George Adams Browne Charles Dalton Joseph Gwilt (made Novitiate, May 2, 1808, by Perkins) Okey Beffour was not listed as a Grand Cross, but as he was made Grand Officer, we might assume he was such. The next meeting listed is March i ~, 1809, when William Henry VVhite, Grand Secretary of the Modern Grand Lodge, was made a Grand Cross. Next, is a meeting on April 30, i8io, when three Novitiates: Henry Wyles, Alfred Perkins and John Foulston were admitted. Sometime in Cambridge in June, i8io, the Rev. William Gretton and Rev. Robert Hole were made Grand Crosses and Joseph ‘White, Knight of the Sepulchre, was admitted. At a meeting on December 15, i8io, the following were present: Wailer Rodwell Wright Grand Commander William Henry White Grand Chancellor William Lindley Grand Chamberlain Hippolyto Joseph da Costa Grand Herald Richard Spencer Rev.

John Austin and John Goff were reported as Novitiates and The Rev. Samuel Hemming and Richard Spencer were elected Grand Crosses.

Ten Novitiates were admitted; then, on May i8, i8i 3, Richard Leeper Percy, Andrew Denis O’Kelly, Lord Hawke, S. J. Tuffnell and C. Beales were made Grand Crosses. On July 19, 1813, the Grand Master reported he had conferred the Novitiate Cross upon H.R.H. Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex. He was elected to receive the Grand Cross, and so admitted. He was then elected a member of the High Council in place of WaIler Rodwell Wright (resigued) and then elected Grand Master of the Order for and during his natural life. John Aldridge, Thomas Blacker and Simon McGillivray were admitted as Grand Crosses. On September i, 1813, a meeting was held to arrange for the pur - chase of a Past Grand Master’s sword for WaIler Rodwell Wright who had been head of the Order for the last nine years. At the previous meeting a hundred pounds was set as the amount to be used for this purpose, and five pounds was to be collected from each member. At this meeting Burckhardt, da Costa, Woodthorpe, D~lton, White and Foulstone paid their subscriptions and Perkins and Hemming in - timated their readiness to pay when called upon. These eight with the Grand Master must have been the nine Grand Cross members of the High Council, although there seems to be no record of two of them being Grand Crosses (da Costa and Woodthorpe). The amount of five pounds each would be io pounds exclusive of anything the Duke added. If the fund was made up to ico pounds, the rest must have come from the funds of the Order. “It was resolved unanimously, that the sum collected or received by the Grand Chamberlain, shall be paid by Him into the hands of Messrs. Herries and Co., Bankers, and placed to the account of W. R. Wright, Esq., and to acquaint the late Grand Master Sir W. R. Wright, of the same, with a request to dispose of the sum either by the purchase of a sword or other ornament, as a mark of remembrance of that affection and regard his zeal and Masonic Labours have established in the hearts of His Brethren and Compan - ions: This resolution, however, to be subject to the appiobation or disapproval of His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, M. E. Grand Master of the Order.” Between 1813 and 1843, the Duke of Sussex headed practically all of the Masonic groups in England. He was the sixth son of King Geoge III, born on january 27, 1773. He was initiated in the Royal York Lodge of Friendship, at Berlin, in 1798. Honorary rank of Past Grand Master was conferred on him in 18o5 by the Grand Lodge of England. On May 13, 1812, he was appointed Deputy Grand Master and on April 13, 1813. he was elected Grand Master in succession to his brother the Prince Regent, afterwards George IV. In December 1813, he became Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England. The Duke was also M. E. Zerubbabel of the Grand Chapter, R.A.M.; Grand Superintendent of the Grand Conclave, K.T.; as well as Grand Masler of the Order of the Red Cross of Palestine. He married, at Rome, in 1793, Lady Augusta Murray, a daughter of the Earl of Dunmore. The marriage was declared null and void and the parties were separated after the birth of a son, Sir Augustus Fred - erick d’Este. He was also president of the Royal Society from 1830 to r 8 39. He was a Unitarian. He died April 21, 1843, being 70 years old.

However, nowhere in these minutes is there any reference to the Red Cross of Constantine. Even Ihe men - tion of the Constitution and Laws which “were read and confirmed” does not say what organization the Constitution and Laws covered. We find mentioned: Grand Councils, Grand Chapters, a High Coun - cil, the creation of Novitiates and “Sovereign or Knt. of the Grand Cross,” but no degree or order is mentioned in the minutes them - selves. Little, however, in his summary, says “the foregoing extracts we conceive, amply prove the relation borne by the Red Cross Order to the Masonic fraternity.” I don’t conceive any such thing. Fifty-two years later, May, i86~, Little says “a few members as - 3-13.4809 sembled, and having re-constituted the Grand Council and elected the venerable Sir Knight William Henry White, Past Grand Chancellor as Grand Sovereign,” the Order was on its way again. White surely was venerable. He was eighty-eight years old and died the following April 5 th. Two distinguished Masonic historians, familiar with these matters, have examined the minutes used by Little. Their opinions are worthy of notice: 4-13-1813 6-16-1811 4-13-1813 5-23-18 11 6- 6.1811 5-18-1813 5-23-1811 5-23-1811 5-18-1813 5-18-1813 7-19-1813 7-19.18 13 5-18-1813 5-18-18 13 7-19-18 13 L. Earc CHAS. PECKOvER (Letter of April 4, ¶958): ~I return your list of people supposed to be associated with the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine before 1865. In my opinion there is not the slightest evidence that any of them had anything whatever to do with this degree. Little made an Order out of it in 1865 and before that date it was just a stray degree without any control. I think Little made all this up arid took his particulars from the K.T. on the assumption that it was working alongside with it. I have full access to Grand Mark Lodge where the Order is administered and they have nothing official before 1865. His facts he obtained from a minute book which both Brother Bridge and I have studied. No where does it state to what degree it belongs. Bridge now thinks that it refers to the Red Cross of Palestine because they applied to Grand Chapter and obtained permission to form a Chapter called The Palestine Chapter to work the degree. I think that you can take it that the Order started in 1865 and that everything according to Little is sus - 12 13"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"pect. My earliest reference to a Red Cross Degree being worked is March 1812, because Finch was advertising rituals of the degree for sale at that date.” GEORGE F. W. BUDGE (Letter of April 15, 1958): “If you are investigating this Order, you may state on my authority that the claim made in the 19th century that a Grand Body was esta- blished at the beginning of the century is untenable, in so far as the Body on which the claim is based is concerned. That Body, with the Duke of Sussex at its head, was not a Red Cross of Constantine. There is little doubt that the Order was floating about as an isolated degree, but at present no evidence has come to light that it was ever organized on a Grand Conclave footing before the latter half of the 19th century. I mention this in order that you may not perpetuate a claim for which there is, as yet, no evidence—the details of which ale demonstrably a false assumption. This is the Red Cross of PaIe.rtine.” I now call attention to a letter written by The Rev. T. F. Raven - shaw, Grand Chaplain of the Grand Lodge of England and a well- known English Freemason of this period: “Dec. 18, 1870 Dear Sir and Bro. ~‘I did not intend to write unpleasantly. The facts are simply these: “The history set forth by Brother Little when the order was ‘revived’ was that distinguished members of the genuine order had the right of conferring it on others. ‘That a certain Venetian (if I remember rightly) Ambassador in the last century had so conferred it on persons in this country, who in turn handed it on, the former G.S. Brother White being one of the last possessors of it, among whose papers in G. Sec.’s ofike Brother Little found an imperfect Ritual. Whet her any member was then living I do not know, but at any rate Bfother Little with some others amended and enlarged the fragmentary Ritual and floated the ‘revived or uine and legitimate continuation of the old order.” der’ as a gen - The above is the first page of the letter that Little used as “proof” of whence came the ritual of the English Rosicrucian Society. This was pure fraud, as will be evident when the rest of the letter is read, for we now have the original, it having been found by Brother H. C. Bruce Wilson in the archives of the S.R.I.A. The letter continues: “and for some five years or so it lived and flourished, tho’ the Sup. Coun- cil 330 declared that it was merely a new form of a degree which belonged to them—as the Scotch S. C. does to this day—so much so that an ob - jection was raised but finally waived in Edinboro to my admission into the ‘Royal Order’ on account of my connection with the Red Cross. Then on the scene appeared Rhodolcanakis, Prince or Grocer, in much wrath and indignation, daiming to be by birth and descent the living and only representative of the hereditary Sovereigns of the Ancient order, denoun- cing the revived order as an imposture, and published a gorgeous volume on the subject. To him Lord Kenlis submitted, and acknowledged that the revived order could not substantiate its claims, and made such change of title as Prince R. required to show its distinction from the Ancient order. “As my attraction to the Order was its being (as was supposed) a general revival of a never entirely extinct order, my interest in it ceased when its claims to be such were relinquished. It might still be a more or less interesting ceremony, but nothing more, and I quietly withdrew. The Pr. Conclave of which I had been a member from an early date, very amiably elected me an Hon. Member, but I have not for many years at - tended the meetings. “F’nally yours, “T P. Ravenshaw” This letter was published in full in my Masonic Rosicrucian. Societies, 1958, to show how Little used the first part to bolster his claim of where the rituals of that Society came from, when he knew that it referred only to the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine, and to the latter’s disadvantage, too. It is direct evidence that Little perverted the meaning of a letter by a prominent Freemason to his own ends. Inferentially, he might naturally be suspected of similar perversions elsewhere—especially in the Red Cross of Constantine, which seemed to be more important to him, as evidenced by the fol - lowing “notice of motion” made in the Rosicrucian Society on April 8, i86i~, to wit, “i—that the new admission into this Society be re - stricted to members of the Red Cross Order. 2—that the regalia of the Red Cross Order be worn at meetings of this Society by those who are Knights of that Order.” Much to Little’s disappointment the Rosicrucian Society was not turned into an appendage of the Red Cross Order. This was mostly due to Brother William James Hughan, well-known and distinguished English Freemason, then Master Gen - eral of the Society, who made a journey of more than three hundred miles, at considerable inconvenience, in order to preside at the meet - ing where he was able to thwart Little’s abortive attempt to graft the two bodies. The Ravenshaw letter also illustrates what, at least, one promi - nent contemporary Freemason thought of the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine following the attack made upon it by Prince Rhodo - canakis. 14 15"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Now let us return to the matter of Major Charles Shirreff, a Grand Inspector General of the Rite of Perfection, which title and “author - ity” he had received in Charleston, South Carolina, in the American Colonies in 1776. In the Proclamation issued by the Grand Sovereign of the Red Cross Order in England on May 29, 1871, the Right Honorable, The Earl of Bective included this curious statement: “That the Red Cross Order claims to be a revived branch of the Masonic brotherhood which formed part of the system of The Baron Hiinde in or about the year 1750 and which has been working in England under various auspices until the establishment of a Grand Council of the Order in or about the year 1796.” The assignment of a derivation of the Order of the Red Cross from the von Hund Rite of Strict Observance appears in this pronoun - ciamento for the first time following the previous pretentions found on page 27 of the r868 SKETCH in the General Statutes by Robert Went- worth Little, Grand Recorder. This first pretention, issuing from Abbe Guistiniani had to be dropped as a result of the action of Prince Rho - docanakis. The second, the Major Charles Shirreff group is inferen - tially kept as the Proclamation also contains a paragraph “that the Order as now conferred is, with certain modifications, the same as that over which the late Duke of Sussex presided from 1813 to 1843.” There seems no reason to give much attention to the claims made in this Proclamation. It appears, at this sight, to be nothing but a sub - stitute claim to replace the original one exhibited three years previously. The first claim was violently questioned by Prince Rhodocanakis and, having been “forced” to change the name of the Order by omitting “Constantine and Rome,” to lighten the action in the eyes of the “Masonic Public,” this new derivation claim appears to have been put forth to “save face.” An examination of the claim should make the “face” very red (no pun intended). To look at these claims in reverse, we have shown that there is nothing in the early material used by Little to substantiate that any Order of this Red Cross existed in 1796. As to Baron von Hund. his order neither existed in England nor had the slightest connection with anything ritualistically related to a Red Cross degree. The Baron died in 1776 and, although one of his henchmen, Johann August von Starck, was in England about a year, he was only interested in a “revised” Order of Strict Observance—in fact, a Rite of his own. This claim, put forth as history, is simply one false as - sumption projected to cover another, quite less preposterous. Karl Gotthelf, Baron von Hund and Alten-Grotkau, was born in Oberlausitz, Germany, on September ii, 1722, and died in Meiningen, Prussia, on October 28, 1776 (some say November 8, 1776). He was initiated in The Lodge of the Three Thistles, Frankfort, Germany, on March 20, 1742. In 1754, he was admitted in the Rite of Clermont but afterwards became a Roman Catholic at the importunity of his wife (Gould, Vol. 3, page r8). 4. FROM r86~ “The Premier Conclave of the Red Cross of Constantine is time immemorial because of its existence previous to the present Grand Jurisdiction located at Mark Masons’ Hall; but its history prior to the year r86o is for those who can find it.” (Waite, Vol. II, page 328 of his Encyclopedia.) quoting from Little’s SKETCH of i868, “the Order continued in this languishing condition until May, 1865, when a few members as - sembled, and having econstituted the Grand Council and elected the venerable Sir Knight William Henry White, Past Grand Chancellor, as Grand Sovereign, proceeded to reestablish the Order upon a working basis.” This is simply the start of the present Order of which Brother Little was the real founder and “guiding spirit.” He did a masterful job in planting and extending the Order in England and elsewhere. It is unfortunate that he fostered on the Order a fabulous “history”, but he did no more than Anderson did in 1738 when the latter loosened upon an unsuspecting Masonic public his “historical bunk.” Like Craft Masonry, which prospered in spite of Anderson’s abortive excur - sion, the Red Cross Order has also survived and prospered. Little was an unusual Mason of his time. He was held in high regard during and after his passing. It may be (and probably is true) that he thought the minutes of the group on which he based his SKETCH were truly the Red Cross of Constantine. I am willing to accept such an assumption. In any case, we Owe a debt of gratitude to Little for his accomplish - ment in putting in existence our Red Cross Order. It seems that here is the place to record a few details about Bro - ther Little: He was born August so, 1838 in Dublin, Ireland and edu - cated for the Church under Brother and the Rev. Barton Gibson, M.A. He did not continue in this field but entered the Civil Service of the Crown in the Emigration Department at Dublin. After this service he migrated to London in 1855 and studied in Mount Joy Academy. 17 16"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"He became a clerk at Freemasons’ Hall in 1862. In i866, he became Cashier, in which position he remained until his election to the office of Secretary of the Royal Masonic Institution for Girls in 1872. There were three other candidates for the office. Brother Little received 305 votes—the other three, 1 ~ votes all together. He held the position un - til his passing on April iz, 1878, and had an excellent record of work in the office. He was buried in Honor Oak, Forest Hill Cemetery at Croydon, Surrey, England.

WOrmING ON MONUMENT ROBERT WENTWORTH LITI’LE Late Secretary of the Royal Masonic institution For Girls Died 12 ApI. 1878 — Age 39 This monument was erected by his Brethren in token of their Love and Esteem. The following is a partial record of Brother Little’s Masonic affili- ations: Royal Union Lodge No. 382, Uxbridge, May 20, 1861. Royal Albert Lodge No. 907, London, 1862 (resigned 1866). Rose of Denmark Lodge No. 975, london—Founder 1863. Second Master and then Secretary until 1875. Villiers Lodge No. 1194, Hampton Court—Founder 1867. Secretary for several years.

Member until his death. Domatic Chapter No. 177, London, 1863. Passed chairs in this Chap - ter. Rose of Denmark Chapter No. 975. london—Founder 1865. First H. and S. F. until 1871. Royal Middlesex Chapter No. 1194, 1-lampton Court—Founder 1867. S.F. until 1874. Member of many Preceptories and Conclaves of the Red Cross of Constantine. Honorary Member of about 90 lodges, chapters and other Masonic bodies and was many times the Consecrating Officer in lodges, ai> pointed by the M. W. G. M. as such. First Provincial Grand Secretary of Middlesex and Provincial Grand Warden in 1875 and held the title of Provincial Grand Master of Middlesex. Also was Provincial H. of the Provincial Grand Chap - ter, 1875, and 300 A. & A. Rite, Oct. 9, 1872. Little became a member of Mount Calvary Chapter, Rose Croix, now No. 3, on May 12, 1869. He joined Palestine Chapter, now No. 29, in 1871 of which he became M. W. S. In the Proceedings of the Grand Imperial Council, Red Cross of Constantine, State of Illinois, USA, i8~, which was the year Knight Companion George W. Warvelle, previously mentioned, was Grand Sov - ereign, we find some “papers” published which were either written by him or others. One is headed “A Memoir of Walter Rodwell Wright,” whose name was “WaIler” not “Walter”. The first paragraph reads as follows: ‘Whatever may have been the circumstances attending the introduc- tion and early exploitation of the Constantinian Orders in England, it is certain that for their perpetuation and subsequent growth we are more largely indebted to Bro. Walter Rodwell Wright than any ether person.” Further along we find: “As this distinguished man and Mason was the virtual founder of the Constantinian Orders as at present organized,” etc. Warvelle points out that Wright was made a Mason in r8oi in Prince of Wales Lodge in London and became Grand Master of the Red Cross Order three years later and died on April a6, 1825. Wright was head of the Red Cross of Palestine in 1804 and he had something to do with the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. The former is the group which Little claimed to be the Red Cross of Constantine. Even these records bear out the fact that whatever it was it died out under the head of the Duke of Sussex and it was William Henry White, who, in r86~, in association with Little, started the present Red Cross Or - der. In another paper, a reproduction of “A Demonstration of the Le - gitimacy of the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine,” by William J. Hughan, a well known Masonic scholar, then of Torquay, England, printed first in the Fieemasons Magazine of London, under the date of May 23, i868—an attempt is made to show that the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine was in existence in 1813, when the two Grand Lodges of England united. This paper was published in the very year that Little’s SKETCH was issued. The arguments used were based on the SKETCH, but three years later the Grand Council repudiated the fact 18 19"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"that it was the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine, so the argument, in retrospect, falls flat. It is a rare thing to see an historical treatment by Brother Hughan which is not based on his personal research (which he so states). Had he made such an investigation he probably would not have issued the paper in the form in which it appeared. These two items are me~ntioned to show how writers, years after the events, were still using them as historical presentations. Much of this same material, copied from such tracts, is being used even today. Hence, one of the reasons for bringing to light many of these mis - conceptions so that our members, and others interested in our Order, will no longer be misled by such fables. As we finish with these early happenings and references, it might prove of minor interest to set down a bit of information concerning a few of those referred to in the preceding pages HIPPOLYTO JOSEPH DA COSTA, Pereira F’urtado de Mendonca. Mackey calls him Hyppolito Jose Da Costa; Waite calls him Hip - polyte Jose Da Costa and Gould calls him Joseph Hippolyte Da Costa, but my title is as he prints it in his book telling of his treatment by the Spanish Inquisition in i8ii. According to this work, he was born in Colonia-do-Sacramento on the river La Plata in Portuguese South America (now Uruguay) and was made a Mason in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. He is titled as a Doctor of Laws and Bachelor of Philosophy from the University of Coimbra, Portugal. It might be that he was the son of the Brazilian poet and revolutionist Claudio Manuel da Costa, who also attended this same University. He was also born in Brazil, in 1729, and was a suicide in prison in 1779, following the Teradentes Conspiracy the previous year. Hippolyto moved to Portugal and, in i8oz, went to England to try and negotiate a treaty of some sort between the Grand Lodge of that country and Portugal. On his return he was imprisoned in solitary confinement for six months and then spent three more years imprisoned by The Inquisition. The Masons of England in some manner, obtained his release and he went there to live. He died in 1823. No one seems to be able to state his lodge in England. Some say Nine Muses ~z~; others, Antiquity in i8o8, and still others, Inverness, February a, i8i~. It is known that he was appointed Provincial Grand Master of Rutlandshire in 1813, but this is a curious appointment for there were no lodges in that county at the time. In 1819, a trio—he, the Duke of Sussex (Grand Master of England) and the Duke of Leinster (Grand Master of Ireland) was granted permission by the French Supreme Council, A. & A. Rite, to form a body in England. It came to naught, however. ISAAC DA COSTA Isaac is mentioned as he might have been a ielative of Hippolyto and he was also prominent in Masonry. The da Costa family was im - portant in England, Portugal, Spain, Brazil and other places. Isaac was born in London, in 1721, and came to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1750 with other wealthy Jews. ‘When the English were in Charleston in 1780 he left there and went to Philadelphia, where he visited Lodge No. 2 in Philadelphia the following year. He was active in the relig - ious life of this city, and in Charleston, where he returned in 1782. He died there on November 23, 1783. He took his son into his business in 1773, but I have not been able to find his son’s name. On June z~, 1781, he was made a Deputy Inspector General of the Rite of Perfec - tion by Hays in Philadelphia. Some say for South Carolina, but he signed a document as “Deputy Grand Inspector General for North America and the West Indies” which is reproduced in Sachse’s 1915 book on old Scottish Rite documents in Pennsylvania. LORD RANCLIFFE OF IRELAND Rt. Hon. Thomas Boothby Parkyns, M.P., was born on July 24, 1755. He was the son and heir apparent of Sir Thomas Parkyns, 3 rd. Baronet (title created in 1681) of Bunny Park, Notts. He was a mem - ber of Parliament (Whig) for Stockbridge, 1784-1790; a Fellow of the Royal Society, December 6, 1787; a Fellow of the Society of Anti - quities, January 17. 1788; a Colonel of Prince of Wales Fencibles, 1795, and was created Baron Rancliffe (Ireland), October 3, 1795. He mar - ned Elizabeth Ann, only daughter of Sir William Tames (1st Baronet) on December ~6, 1783. He died November 17, i8oo, and was suc - ceeded by his only son, George Augustus Henry Anne (born June ro, 1785 and died [une 1, i8~o), who was also a Mason of some repute. Lord Rancliffe was Provincial Grand Master of Derbyshire, 1789- 1792; of Leicestershire, 1793-1812; of Nottinghamshire, 1783-1802; and of Rutland, 1789-1798. According to a caption under his picture in The Life of Constantine, 2nd edition, London, 1874, with a preface by Robert Wentworth Little, he was “Grand Commander of the Order 20 21"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"of Constantine and Philippi, Supreme G.M. of Kt.

The Baronetcy (Kenlis, by which he was known until 1870) was created, Sept. io, 1837. The Earldom, to which he became entitled in 1870, was created October 24, 1766. He had the coat-of-aims “Headfort” (Burke, page io 7 z). The Earl was an Honorary Colonel in the 4 th Bn. of the Border Regiment and was the son of the 3 rd Marquess of Headfort. The titles which he bore were not actual but “courtesy” titles, held by the eldest son and heir of the Marquess of Headfort. He assumed them when the 2nd Marquess of Headfort died on Ekcember 6, 1870 and his father became the 3rd Marquess. Thomas Taylour died before his father and his younger brother automatically assumed these titles, ultimately be - coming the 4 th Marquess of Headfort on July 22, 1894. Thomas’ son then automatically assumed the courtesy titles of Bective and Kenlis. Our Earl of Bective was educated at Eaton, 1858-1862 and at Christchurch, Oxford. He was High Sheriff for Westmoreland in i868 and a member of Parliament for the same, 1871-1892. as well as for Kendal, 1885.1892. He was Grand Sovereign of the Red Cross Order, 1866-1874. On his death he left a fortune of £ 594,319 net. SIR FREDERICK MARTIN WILLIAMS, M.P. He was born on January z~, 1830, and married Mary Christian (died May 22, 1892) on June io, i8~8. He died, September 3. 1878. He was a member of Parliament for Truro, 1865-1 878. The Baronetcy ““Williams of Tregullow,” was created August 4, i866. 1-le was Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Cornwall and Deputy Warden of the Stannaries. In the Red Cross of England he was Grand Viceroy, 1866- 1874, Grand Sovereign, 1874-1877, and a Provincial Grand Master of Cornwall in the Mark Grand Lodge, 1867-1878.

No person of this name ever sat on the throne of the Greek Empire, according to Warville (page ~ of the 916 Inquiry). SIR FRANCIS BURDETT, BT. Son of William Jones Burdett, of Copt. Hall, Twickenham, Mid - dlesex, was born on March 23, i 8 i 3. He was educated at Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1834, he entered the Army and became Lieut. Colonel of i 7 th Lancers. He married Amelia Eliza, daughter of Major James Sharp, of Kincarrathie, County Perth, on October 22, 1842. She died, April ,~., i866. On August 22, 1867, he married Mary Dorothy, daughter of John Smyth, of Cleatham County, Durham. She died, May 31, 1892. He succeeded his cousin, Sir Robert Burdett, on June 7, i88o. becoming 7 th Baronet. No one claimed Barony at his death and it is now dormant. There is another Barony of the same name but it has no relation to this one. He was also Sheriff of Surrey, i88o. MASONIC P. 5. G. Warden, 1869. Rep. G. L. of Ireland & G. L. of England ist Pro. G.

CHARLES SHIRREFF Initiated in Louisbourg, Cape Breton, America, in 1758, while serv- ing with the British Army. It has not been definitely established in which of the many military lodges in Louisbourg he was initiated. It appears that it was a lodge chartered in the z8th Regiment of Foot which was chartered by Colonel Richard Gridley on November 13, 1758. Gridley was Junior Warden of the St. John’s Grand Lodge in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. In the year following, the Regiment moved to Quebec with its lodge. On November 28, 1759, at Quebec, five Regimental Lodges (Nos. 136, 192, 195, 218 and 245, all on the Irish Registry and No. with a Louisbourg Warrant) formed a Provincial Grand Lodge and the Deputy appointed was Thomas A. Span, Captain in the 28th Regiment, although it is not recorded that this lodge was involved in the forma - tion of the Provincial Grand Lodge. Colonel Simon Fraser, of the 7 8th Regiment, became the Grand Master on June 24, 1760 and, on 22 23"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"November 2 4 th of the same year, Span was elected and served until December 27, 1761. In some letters of Shirreff, reproduced in various publications, he said he was made a Royal Arch Mason and Knight Templar in America. Whether this was in Quebec, East Florida, Charleston, South Carolina, or elsewhere, he does not rev~al. In 1785, he stated he had “arrived to the Ne Plus Ultra or z~ step.” This refers to his having been made a Deputy Inspector General of the Rite of Perfection in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1776, by Augustin Prevost. Shirreff was in East Florida where, he says, he “presided in every capacity” in Masonic bodies. In 1778, he obtained a Warrant from Grand Master, The Duke of Atholl, at St. Augustine, for the i 4 th Regi - ment. Augustin Prevost was appointed Adjutant of the 1st Battalion of the 6oth Regiment on June 25, 1771 and, in 1778, this Battalion was in St. Augustine, East florida. He was at the Siege of Charleston in 1780 which held the city until Dec. 14, 1782. Somehow the 3 rst Regi - ment of Foot in Pensacola, Florida, got a Warrant for St. Andrew’s Lodge No. i, May 3, 1771. Shirreff granted a Warrant on May 6, 1788 to ‘White, C. Treas. of the Grand Lodge and others for a Lodge of Perfection i 4 th degree, by virtue of his Patent as D.G.l. of the Rite of Perfection. He is listed as living in Whitchurch in Shropshire. He was Master of several lodges and constituted one on Jersey, one of the British Channel islands, off the coast of France. He was Master of several lodges in America. He was Founder and First Master of the Jersey Lodge, known as No. i, at the town of St. Helarys. It was erected in 1765 as a “Modern” Lodge and given the number 349, becoming 197 in 1792. It was erased in 1812. Shirreff left the Lodge in 1768. Following Lodge No. i, Shirreff got four others started in the County. One, Salopian, No. 262, being still in existence in Shrews - bury. He was D.P.G.M. for a time. 24 SI3AI~ U1~ GRANo (.oNJ AyES"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"RED CROSS OF CONSTANTINE CHRONOLOGIcAL LIST or Gr~in SOVEREIGNS SLAIS 01 C;RANI) (ONCIAVIS William Heniy White Lord Kenlis (afterwards Earl of Bective) Sir Frederick N’Iartin Williams, Bt.

SCOTLAND [n 1950, Sir Knight George S. Draffen, of Scotland, published a 38 page pamphlet entitled The Red Cross of Constantine in Scotland— An Historical Sketch. The author is too modest in saying it was “An Historical Sketch” because he has gathered into a compact form all that research has brought to light concerning the Order in Scotland. Previous writers on this subject have either iguored or vaguely mentioned the full situation respecting the Degree itself. Little said next to nothing in his SKETCH in i868. Consequently, what Draffen shows in Part I of his pamphlet is of importance, and I venture to say that degrees having the name “RED CROSS” were being conferred in England upwards to 1865, in various Masonic bodies. He points out that degrees of this name were at various times conferred in at least five groups in Scotland. He also points out that “little reliance can be placed on accounts of the Degree written before i 876.” It appears that it might have come from Ireland with the Templar degrees. It is certain that the Royal Grand Conclave, in 1819, took over the De - gree. Without going into the complex details of the various Masonic groups conferring Chivalric degrees in Scotland—suffice to say that the Grand Encampment of Temple and Malta (set up in Scotland in 1822 by Charter from the early Grand Encampment of Ireland, with the name Early Grand Encampment of Scotland), had changed its name about s88o. It continued as a separate body until 1909 when it united 30 31"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"with the Great Priory of Scotland. “Until the last it worked the Degree of Red Cross of Constantine.” This Degree then “seems to have been left in the air without a governing body,” but it may have worked irregularly—at least one record of such being extant. The Royal Grand Conclave, in i8io, controlled 19 degrees. When the Supreme Grand Royal Areh Chapter was formed in 1817, twelve were assumed and seven were under the Teinplar section, including “Knight of the Red Cross of Constantine” and “Knight of the Holy Grave.” The latter appears to be the same as “Knight of the Holy Sepulchre,” as a manusciipt book in the Grand Mark Lodge of Eng - land, undated, called “Masonic Templarism” contains information on a degree called “Knight of the Holy Grave or Sepulchre.” This work seems to show a mixture of the two degrees. In any event, by 1830, the Red Cross of Constantine Degree was purely optional and, after 1845. no record has come to light of any further conferring of it. I have left out much of the information regarding the various movements of bodies conferring the degree in Scotland because of the complexity of the Masonic gioups involved and the shifting of authority. These matters are fully covered in Knight Companion Draffen’s fine pamphlet, to which those especially interested, are referred. So far as Ihe present bodies of the Red Cross of Constantine are concerned it was re-introduced into Scotland from England in 1871. From this point on the Grand Imperial Council of Scotland has min - utes of most of the happenings. Knight Companion Draffen has repro - duced a number of them so that the picture is quite clear up to the formation of the Grand Imperial Council on August 21, 1876. Briefly, they are: June 4, 1871—Meeting—3 present (lames B. Mercer, Robert Smith Brown and John Taylor). Mercer exhibited documents from Robert Went’ worth Little (England) granting powers to organize a conclave in Edinburgh. He then installed the two as Knights of the Order. July 15, 1871—Meeting—Robert Smith Brown consecrated Viceroy. (It does not show any Sovereign but I assume it was James B. Mercer.) July 18, 1871—Meeting—James Aby Beattie and George S. Mitchell as Knights. July 19, 1871—Meeting—William Grant, Arthur Muir Bruce, Henry Emest Jones, and Anton Muller installed as Knights. July 20, 1871—Meeting—Henry Foale, Robert Smart and Thomas Sim installed as Knights. 32 Petition prepared for a Conclave to be named “The Edinburgh Conclave” to he “assigned number 4, at present in abeyance.” A rather curious matter is involved here. Eleven of the twelve members’ names (Anton Muller did not sign) were on the petition, and one whose name appears for the first time—Francis Law. Knight Companion James B. Mercer was recommended to he the First \\‘iceroy. Ten were members of St. Clair Lodge No. 319’ July 26, 1871—Meeting—Arthur Von Adelstein installed a Knight. July 31, 1871—Meeting—Charter for “The Edinburgh Condave No. 4” received—(stated July 21, 1871) ; four additional officers elected. Hugo Tomasezewski was installed a Knight.

Em. Sir Knight Col. Burdett, M. Em. Grand Viceroy of England, requesting his formal consent to accept the office of Grand Sovereign, and also requesting him to appoint his Viceroy, suggesting to Col. Burdett to appoint his own son-in-law, Brother Houston of Clerkington, to that important office.” On June i~, 1876, a joint meeting of Conclave No. 4 and No. 103 was held. A probable date of the inaugural meeting was set, August ~, 1876. Mention was made that Col. Houston could not then accept as Grand Viceroy, for which he expressed his thanks. June 21, 1876, was set for a date to choose proposed officers. On this date representa - tives from Conclaves No. 4, 103, 114, 127, 130 and 133 were present. Col. Buxdett was elected Grand Sovereign, certain resolutions were adopted and Grand Councillors and Grand Senators were elected, Major W. H. Ramsay being Grand Viceroy and Robert S. Brown, Grand Recorder. On July 13, 1876, another meeting was held when four Sir Knights were conseciated as Viceroys: Major W. H. Ramsay, Capt. W. H. Biown, James Crichton and J. Carmichael, M.D., after which these same Sir Knights, along with A. M. Bruce and A. Dalgleish, were en - throned as Sovereigns. An executive committee meeting was held on July x9, 1876 to further arrangements for the inauguration of the Grand Imperial Council. On August i8th, another meeting was held of the Grand Senate. Eight members of Edinburgh Conclave No. 4 were made Viceroys and then Sovereigns. The Inaguration took place in Freemasons’ Hall, George Street, Edinburgh, on Monday, August 21, 1876. A deputation from the Grand Imperial Council of England was present for the purpose: Robert Wentworth Little, P.S.G.G., Grand Recorder Henry C. Levander, G. H. Chancellor John Boyd, G. Architect Thomas W. White, G. Hiitoriographer George Kenning, G. As.r’: Recorder William T. Home, G. Sword Bearer Herbert Dicketts, G. Usher Cutherbert E. Peck, M.P.S. No. 128 Previous to the meeting, Col. Burdett, Grand Sovereign-elect, was affiliated with Edinburgh Conclave No. 1. The inauguration ceremony was performed in full form with Frater Little acting as Grand Sovereign and Frater Levander as Grand Viceroy. The following were installed: 1—Col. Francis Burdett (4) Grand Sovereign 1—Major William H. Raxnsay (4) Grand Viceroy 6—Robert Beveridge (133) Grand Sr. General 4—Henry J. Shields (127) Grand Jr. General 4—Rev. James H. Tait (4) Grand High Prelate’ 3—George W. Wheeler (114) Grand High Chancellor 1—Robert S. Brown (4) Grand Recorder 1—James Crichton (4) Grand Treasurer With the inauguration meeting behind it, the Grand Imperial Council of Scotland began its independent existence with six Con - claves on its roll. Within a year (May 31, 1877), Inverurie Conclave No. 9 was chartered. It became dormant in i 88a; was reopened in 1895 and became dormant again in i~oi; was reopened in 1917 and again became dormant in 1935; and finally reopened in 1939. This gives us a little mystery—what about numbers 7 and 8? Draf - fen tells us “we first hear of them in a printed list of officers and Con - claves published in 1907.” They were dormant then and nothing more is known of them (No. 7 was at Ayr and No. 8 was at Nairn). The first annual meeting was held on October i, 1877. Lord In - verurie (later Earl of Kintore) was installed Grand Viceroy in the vacant position due to the passing of Major Ramsay in April of that year. Representatives were exchanged with the Sovereign Grand Coun - cil of the United States (withdrawn in 1895), the Grand Councils or Conclaves of England, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Sir Knight Dralfen states that “The record of the next few years is not one of any great historical interest. The Order in Scotland was not particularly strong.” The Grand Recorder, Robert S. Brown, died in 1911 and was succeeded by Alfred A. Arbuthnot Murray, under whose administration “Printed transactions were begun and the keep - ing of a written Minute Book ceased. The roll of Conclaves had risen to only nineteen, of which many were dormant and others moribund.” Numbers i, ~, 11 and i8 were the only active Conclaves. In 1897 (iqth annual), the Constitutions were amended, and they were deem - ed sufficient to gather Paisley Abbey Conclave, the last surviving Early Grand Conclave body, into the fold, as No. 20—chartering it on Novem - ber 2, 1911. World War I took a toll in the Order in Scotland. In 1916, the admissions were nine, all but one in Edinburgh Conclave, 35 34"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"No. i.

GRAND IMPERIAL CONCLAVE OF CANADA The first reference to the Red Cross of Constantine in Canada is the issuing of a charter by the Grand’ Imperial Conclave of England to Robert Marshall of New Brunswick Province on April 13, 1869, the Conclave being named McLeod Moore No. 13. In 1869, Lord Kenlis, Grand Sovereign of the Grand Imperial Conclave of England, appointed Lt. Colonel William James Bury MacLeod Moore the Chief Intendant General of the Masonic and Military Order of the Red Cross of Constantine, Holy Sepulchre and St. John for the Dominion of Canada. In 1876, he was made a Past Grand Viceroy of the Grand Imperial Conclave of England. Moore interested a number of qualified Freemasons to form Con - claves and the following were chartered by the Grand Imperial Con - clave in England: 1—13 2—21 3—22 4—24 5—25 6—26 7—27 8—29 9—30 10—31 11—41 12—49 13—64 14-65 McLeod Moore St. Helena Harrington Huron Moore Holy Land Lactantian Mount Calvary Harrington On4ario St. James Macdonald Oriental Heradius (Gethsemane) St. John, N.B.

A Grand Imperial Council was formed and officers were clected and appointed. Four “Chief Intendants General” were selected: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Four “Intendants General of Divisions” were also appointed: 1-lamilton, Toronto, Ottawa and London. All present, ex - cept the proxy for New Brun~swrck, were from Ontario Conclaves. New numbers were issued to the fourteen Conclaves as seen in the above listing. It was moved that the new body approve a move to combine the Red Cross of Constantine, the Royal and Select Masters and Royal Aik Manners into a single Grand Council of Rites. The rank of “Past Most Illustrious Grand Sovereign” was conferred upon Colonel Moore, who introduced the Order into Canada in 1869, and to Douglas Haning - ton, who ably assisted in its extension. Thus ends the proceedings of the formation meeting of the first Grand Imperial Conclave of the Red Cross of Constantine in Canada. Few of the Conclaves survived beyond x87~. It was a case of “spread- ing the icing too thin.” During the years 1895 - moo an effort was made to reactivate the Order but this period was followed by another of dormancy. The oldest Conclave—McLeod Moore No. m, in New Brunswick. was revived in 1893 and again on May 14, 192~. chiefly through the efforts of Robert Marshall. one of the first four Chief In - tendant Generals. Huron Conclave No. 4 in London, Ontario, was resuscitated on December 5, 1931 through the efforts of John H. C. Woodward and Edwin Smith, and Holy Land Conclave No. 6 of Toronto, Ontario, was resuscitated on March 1, 1936 by John B. Nixon, Grand Sentinel of the early Grand Imperial Conclave. On August u, 1936, St. James Conclave No. ii, of Maitland, Ontario, was resusci - tated. Meanwhile, Melvin M. Downey was instrumental in forming the following Conclaves in Western Canada, and a new one was form - ed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, all chartered by England: 175—Taylor 179—Selkirk 181—Rose and Lily I 82—Royal Edward Edmonton, Alberta Winnipeg, Manitoba Regina, Saskatchewan Halifax, Nova Scotia May 30, 1932 Dec. 20, 1934 Apr. 4, 1936 Apr. 15, 1936 A Grand Division Conclave was then set up by the Grand Imper - ial Conclave of England with James Bower Nixon as Grand Intendant General. 40 A strange situation confronts the historian here. Although a Grand Imperial Conclave of Canada was organized in 1875, and the fourteen Conclaves chartered by the Grand Imperial Conclave of Eng - land were given new numbers under their new Grand Conclave in Canada, the six surviving Conclaves were now referred to by their original English numbers and formed into this Divisional Conclave of England in 1933. The situation appears to have been a temporary ar - rangement preliminary to a meeting held by representatives of these Conclaves (except No. 13) held in London, Ontario, on July z, 1936, which mesulted in the formation of a second Grand Conclave in Can - ada. The roll of Conclaves listed in the 1936 Proceedings follows: i—McLeod Moore (13) 2—Huron (24) 3—Holy Land (26) 4—St. James (41) 5—Taylor (175) 6—Selkirk (179) 7—Rose and Lily (181) 8—Royal Edward (182) 9—Novicate (*) 10—St. Helena (21) St. John, N.B. London, Ont. Toronto, Ont. Maitland, Ont. Edmonton, AI!ta. Winnipeg, Man Regina, Sas. Halifax, N.S. London, Ont. Montreal, Que. (*) This Conclave was set up ror the Grand Crosses. No men - tion is made of it in the 1937 Proceedings but the list appended to these Proceedings shows No. 9 to be Lactanlian in Kingston, Ontario (formerly No. 27, England) as resuscitated, July 2, 1936 and St. Helena in Montreal, the same date. Thus, the younger of the two gets the lower number in the new Grand Conclave. In the 1936 Proceed - ings Conclaves 22, 25, 27 (given No. 9 in 1937), 29, 30, 31, 64 and are listed as dormant. A mystery is—what happened to Macdonald Conclave No. 49, chartered by the Grand Imperial Conclave of Eng - land on February i6, 1871 and given the number 12 in the first Grand Imperial Conclave of Canada? This Conclave was in N’lillbrook, On - tario. In subsequent lists in the Proceedings I have seen no further reference to this Conclave. The Conclaves in 1936 had 138 members. Numbers 9 and ma, who only had a member or two listed, are no longer found after 1938. In 1946, number 7 ended its life. In 1948, we find the first new Con - claves being chartered since the start of the second Grand Imperial Conclave—twelve years before.

The Grand Imperial Conclave of England chartered the first Con - clave (No. 38) in Washington, Pennsylvania, on December 14, 1870. From that date to May 8, 1876, when the last Conclave was established in the United States by England, forty-seven Conclaves were chartered: Pennsylvania, i~; New York, ia; Illinois, ~; Massachusetts, ~; Indiana, Tennessee, Texas and Kentucky, x each. Most of these Conclaves in some of these States formed Grand Conclaves, to wit: Pennsylvania, which came to be known as the Empire of the East; Illinois, which came to be known as the Empire of the West; Vermont; New York; Massachusetts and Rhode Island; Michigan; Kentucky, Indiana and New Jersey. Maine also formed a Grand Conclave but their Conclaves were started by the Grand Conclave of Michigan. Only Pennsylvania, Illinois, Vermont and Maine survived. In addition, a Sovereign Grand Council and a Supreme Grand Chapter of the Grand Cross were form - ed. These also became defunct. The two larger of these Grand Conclaves, Pennsylvania and Illi - nois, have intricate histories. Much of the time spent at their annual and other Grand Conclaves was devoted to discussions concerning questions of authority in the early years, some of which was with the 44 Grand Conclave of England. As time svent on the discussions were jurisdictional matters and, in latter years, attempts to consolidate the two Grand Conclaves. Their Proceedings for the most part are avail - able in the large Masonic libraries (especially in Massachusetts which has an exceptionally fine run of these Proceedings). Many of them, however, lack the very information desired, especially in the early years. In the 1870’s, many of the Proceedings contain articles on historical phases of the Order, usually more decorative than factual. They are based on the “effusion” of William Wentworth Little and, as Robert Macoy published many of the State Proceedings, the same “historical tract” is found again and again in these publications no matter in what State they covered. There are exceptions, especially in the more recent years. Shortly after the turn of the century, George W. ‘Warvelle, of Illinois, published a number of papers in and out of the Proceedings which have certain value. More recently, Edward A. Glad of Chicago and Charles E. Chalmers of New York, issued material of real value, when the portions concerning the Order previous to its introduction into the United States is discounted—for it was nothing more than copyings from previous writers who had taken Little’s material literally. No attempt will be made to cover the various Grand Conclaves in full. Each of the four which survived has supplied material enough to devote many pages of analysis.

Grand Imperial Council of Knights of the Red Cross of Constan - tine and Appendant Orders of Knights of the Holy Sepulchre and Knights of St. John the Evangelist of Pennsylvania and Jurisdiction thereunto belonging; name changed, October i6, 1935 to Grand Imper - ial Council of The Imperial, Ecclesiastical and Military Order of Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine for the United States of America, Empire of the East. Lt. Colonel William James Bury MacLeod Moore was appointed “Chief Intendant or Inspector General for the Dominion” of Canada some time in 1869 by Lord Kenlis, Grand Sovereign of the Grand Im - penal Conclave of England. Search in the printed records of the Order in Canada and the United States fails to reveal the exact date of Moore’s appointment but there seems no reason to doubt it for there are documents extant and copies of others to show that he was signing as such an officer starting in 1870. On February i6, 1870, Moore was authorized by the Grand Con - clave in England to introduce the Order into the United States. On September 3 oth of the same year, by a Commission from Laprairie, Quebec, Alfred Creigh of Washington, Pennsylvania, was made “the Representative of the Grand Council of the Order of the Red Cross of Rome and Constantine in England *** to introduce & establish this Imperial, Ecclesiastical & Military Order into the State of Penn - sylvania.” In the same Commission, he was appointed Intendant- General for Pennsylvania. On January 1, 1871, he was appointed by the Grand Conclave of England, directly, to organize subordinate Con - claves, and on October 4, 1871, the rank of Past Grand Viceroy was conferred on him by the English Grand Conclave. Under this authority fourteen Conclaves were established in Penn - sylvania, after which Creigh applied to England for authority to esta - blish a Grand Conclave in that State. On January 25, 1872, the per- mission was granted (copies of the Moore Commission to Creigh and the English Commission to him are found in many of the Proceedings of the Grand Conclave of Pennsylvania, 1906, page ii being one—as well as in those of other States). On June i~ 1872, in Reading, Pennsylvania, with representatives of thirteen of the fourteen Conclaves in the State present, with Knight Companion Creigh presiding, the Grand Conclave of Pennsylvania was established with the following top two officers and Recorder: Calvin L. Stowell .............. Grand Sovereign Christian F. Knapp .............. Grand Viceroy Alfred Creigh .................. Grand Recorder These Sir Knights were all important figures in the Red Cross of Constantine Order during the early years of its existence in the United States. Stowell was given the rank of Past Grand Sovereign (England, Nov. 14, 1877 and Scotland, July 26, 1877) and Grand Cross (England, Jan. 8, 1885) Annual meetings were held regularly, with a few exceptions. Vari - ous matters of jurisprudence and jurisdiction were discussed. The mat - ters of the two national bodies—the Sovereign Grand Council of the United States, formed on June i, 1875, and the Supreme Grand Chap - ter of the Grand Cross, organized on June zi, 1877, provided much discussion and action as the years went on. These bodies will be dis - cussed under appropriate headings later on. At the end of 1879 only eight Conclaves were active with a membership of 95 Sir Knights and six Conclaves suspended, with a membership of 93. Some of the sus - pended Conclaves were later reactivated. Following the turn of the century activity picked up and a much greater activity started in the second quarter of the century. This is reflected from the examination of the membership figures and in - crease in the number of Conclaves, the latter numbering 34 which had been given numbers in this Grand Conclave when the amalgamation took place with the Empire of the West on February i8, 1958. 46 47"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"STATISTICS OF ANNUAL ASSEMBLIES AND GRAND SOVEREIGNS 1 June 14, 1872 2 Feb. 20, 1873 3 Feb. 19, 1874 4 Feb. 18, 1875 5 Feb. 17, 1876 6 Feb. 21, 1877 7 Dec. 4, 1877 8 Feb. 20, 1879 9 Feb. 19, 1880 10 Feb. 17, 1881 11 Feb. 16, 1882 12 Mar. 7, 1883 13 Feb. 21, 1884 14 Feb. 19, 1885 15 Feb. 18, 1886 16 Feb. 17, 1887 17 Mar. 6, 1888 18 Mar. 5, 1889 19 Mar. 4, 1890 20 Mar. 3, 1891 21 Mar. 1, 1892 22 Feb. 28, 1893 23 Mar. 6, 1894 24 Mar. 3, 1895 25 Mar. 3, 1896 26 Mar. 2, 1897 27 Mar. 7, 1898 28 Feb. 28, 1899 29 Mar. 6, 1900 30 Mar. 5, 1901 31 Mar. 4, 1902 32 Mar. 3, 1903 33 Mar. 1, 1904 34 June 7, 1905 35 June 6, 1906 36 June 5, 1907 37 June 3, 1908 38 June 2, 1909 39 June 1, 1910 40 June 7, 1911 41 June 5, 1912 42 June 4, 1913 43 June 3, 1914 44 June 2, 1915 45 June 7, 1916 Reading, Pa.

In 1879, num - bers 6, ~, 9, i~, 13 and 14 had their charters suspended. They had enrolled 93 Knights before suspension. Numbers 15, i6, 17 and iB 50 withdrew to form the Grand Council of Michigan in 1874. The re - maining eight had enrolled 95 Knights. Actually numbers 12, 13 and 14 were not operative and soon became dormant. Tn 1916, when St. Paul’s in New York City was chartered, it was given the number 12. Why the next Conclave chartered two years later was not given the number 13 instead of i6 is not known. The Conclaves subsequently chartered became 17, i8, etc. Conclave No. l was eventually moved from Washington to Pittsburgh. MEMBERSHIP Note: These remarks concerning membership in the Empire of the East must apply to such membership statistics which follow for not only this Empire, but for all the States where figures are shown. The early Grand Recorders were not mathematicians for they appear to have known nothing about simple arithmetic. They end one year with a certain membership and start the next year with another figure. In their totals often-times the additions and subtractions are faulty. I have tried to give a fairly true picture of the membership when fig- ures are available, corrected to make the figures jibe from year to year. Until Knights Ward and Glad became Grand Recorders of the two Empires — East and West, I will not vouch for accuracy. These two were really the first who understood what they were doing.

Grand [mperial Council of the Imperial, Ecclesiastical and Miii - taiy Order of the Red Cross of Constantine and Appendant Orders for the United States of America, Mexico and the Philippines (Or - ganized as Grand Imperial Council of the State of Illinois, Chicago, August 30, 1872; as the Grand Imperial Council of the Western Masonic Jurisdiction of the United States at Jacksonville, Florida, Oc - tober 13, 1899; as the Grand Imperial Council for the United States of America at Topeka, Kansas, June i6, i~ii; and finally as above at Peoria, Illinois, June 8, 1946). The formation meeting which resulted in the organization of the Grand Council of Illinois was held on August 30, 1872, in the Hall of St. John Conclave No. 69 (England). The meeting was called by Sir Knight Jonalhan John French, who had received Ihe grades of the Order on December i ~, 1871, in Orient Conclave No. 45, in Blooms- burg, Pennsylvania. He was made a Divisional Inspector General for Illinois on December 29, 1871 and shortly thereafter of Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, etc. Representatives from six English chartered Conclaves formed ~he Grand Council of Illinois, they having the following membership, at that time: 1 St. John (69) Chicago 13 2 Accolade (70) Augusta 14 3 Freeport (72) Freeport 12 4 Kadosh (78) Cairo 13 5 Rose Croix (79) Dixon 11 6 Orient (80) Fairbury 11 Total 74 The Grand Officers included the following: Jonathan John French Grand Sovereign Loyal Levi Munn Grand Viceroy James Hoge Miles Grand Recorder Sir Knight French chartered the following Conclaves: 7 Coeur de Leon Athol, Mass. Nov. 29, 1873 8 St. Paul’s Woonsocket, R. I. Dec. 5, 1873 9 St. Andrew’s Providence, R. 1. Dec. 12, 1873 10 Constantine Alton, R. 1. Oct. 26, 1874 The Massachusetts and Rhode Island Conclaves withdrew to form the Grand Council of those States on December 22, 1873 and, by 1898, five of the six Conclaves left had ceased to operate. Only St. John, No. i in Chicago was left. In the meantime, three others were char - tered so that with the Premier Conclave and these three the member- shin in Illinois in 1898 was as follows: 1 St. John Chicago, III. 36 2 Saxa Rubra Champaign, HI. 30 3 St. Helena Peoria, III. 20 4 St. Paul Jacksonville, Fla. 9 Tota] membership 95 It is obvious that numbers 2, 3 & 4 were previously assigned to Conclaves in 1872, and numbers 5 to io to Conclaves in Illinois, Massachusetts and Rhode Lsland. Consequently, Saxa Rubra should have been given the number 1, St. Helena the number 12, and St. Paul the number 13. It appears, therefore, that a new start was made in 1893, when Saxa Rubra was chartered and they considered that they only had one Conclave and from that date we find the present listing in Iheir Proceedings.

Grand Council of Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine and Knights of the Holy Sepulchre of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. (The Constitutions, Statutes and Regulations printed following the Proceedings of the first meeting add “Masonic and Military Order.”) The Formation Meeting was held on December 22, 1873, in Mas - onic Hall, Worcester, Massachusetts, with five Conclaves—Numbers 85 and 104 under England, and ~, 8 & ~ chartered from Illinois. Auth - orization was issued by Jonathan J. French, Grand Sovereign of the Grand Imperial Council of Illinois, on December 29, 1871. French was Divisional Intendant General for Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. He visited Worcester on June 23, 1872, where he conferred the Orders on twelve Knights Templar and, on the following day, St. John’s Conclave No. 85 (Eng - land) was chartered. Soon after this visit, Alfred Creigh, Chief Inten - dant General for the United States, appointed Nathaniel G. Tucker of Massachusetts the Intendant General for Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Tucker formed Unity Conclave No. 104 (England) on July 2, 1873. On November s 3 th following, Knight Companion Jonathan J. French, Grand Sovereign of [he Grand Council of Illinois, appointed Knight Companion Tucker the Intendant General of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. This seems to have made Tuckei Intendant General for both England (through Creigh) and Illinois (through French), a situ - ation rather confusing. Tucker then proceeded to form Conclaves in Athol, Massachusetts, and Woonsocket and Providence, Rhode Island, with numbers ~, 8 & ~. These Conclaves are not presently listed in Il - linois. The numbers of the three Conclaves were changed on the for - mation of the Grand Conclave of Massachusetts and Rhode Island to No. 85—i; No. 194—2; No. 7—3; No. 8—4; and No. 9—5. The election which ensued showed: Nathaniel G. Tucker Grand Sovereign Henry C. Field Grand Viceroy George E. Boyden Grand Recorder The officers were installed by Knight Companion Jonathan J.

At the same meeting St. Bern - ard No. 8, at Greenfield, Massachusetts, was chartered but a Dispensa - tion for a Conclave in Weymouth, Massachusetts, to be named Mount Olivet, was continued.

Grand Imperial Council of Knights of the Red Cross of Constan - tine and Knights of the Holy Sepulchre for the State of Michigan. On call of Knight Companion E. Bumham Tracy, Past Sovereign of Michigan Conclave No. 64 (England), in Masonic Hall, Detroit, Michigan, on April io, 1874, the Grand Imperial Council of Michigan was formed. The Proceedings simply list the five Conclaves having re - presentatives present—No. 64 (England), and numbers i~, i6, 17 & i8. It is known, however, that those with the numbers 15 to i8 were char - tered by the Grand Council of Pennsylvania. Officers elected were installed by Calvin L. Stowell, Grand Sov- ereign of the Grand Council of Pennsylvania, which included the fol - lowing: D. Bumham Tracy Grand Sovereign R. Henry Morrison Grand Viceroy John Rex Bardwell Grand Recorder A petition for a charter for Fidelitus Conclave No. 8, at Jackson, Michigan, was granted. At a special meeting on December i8, 1874, charters for five Conclaves in Maine were granted. It also appears that charters for five Conclaves in Vermont were authorized. Application was made for a charter for a Conclave in Grand Rapids and resultecF in a granting of same “to be named and numbered at its organization and dedication.” No other copies of Proceedings are known. In the listing of the Conclaves it will be noted that the numberings of five Conclaves in Kentucky were given earlier numbers in 1875 than those authorized in 1874.

There was considerable controversy concerning recognition of this Grand Council as it was claimed they had violated the rule of Knight Templar requirement. However, it appears that not too much notice was taken about the legality as most of the Proceedings of the Grand Councils existing at this time carried the list of the Grand Officers in Kentucky and the date of formation. It formed five Conclaves in In - diana and they formed a Grand Council for that State, which, in turn, was only recognized by some of the State Grand Conclaves—in fact, in Indiana, a rival Grand Council was formed.

This Grand Council was formed on May i, 1875, in Burlington, Vermont, with representatives of No. 113 (England) and Numbers r8, 19, 20, 21, and 22 under the Grand Council of Michigan. Election of officers showed, among others, the following, who were installed by Knight Companion D. Bumham Tracy, Grand Sovereign of Michi - ga n: George 0. Tyler Grand Sovereign Henry D. Bean Grand Viceroy Edward E. Greenleaf Grand Recorder Over the years the Grand Council met regularly until 1926 (with one exception). It failed to meet again until 1943, and then not again until 1958. On June 8, 1943, a meeting titled “the fifty-second Annual” (1920 was not held), was held in Burlington. There were present Christie B. Crowell, Grand Sovereign since 1918 (26 years) and six others, three of whom are now deceased. It was noted that the Grand Council had been dormant for eighteen years and that only Star of Bethlehem Conclave No. i, in Burlington, existed out of the six ori - ginally composing the Grand Council of Vermont. They agreed to re - organize the Grand Council to perpetuate the Order in Vermont. A slate of eight Grand Officers was elected, only three of whom are still 66 67"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"with us. It is noted that Ray V. Denslow, then Grand Sovereign of the Empire of the West was present as a visitor and made an address. Nothing came of this attempt to reorganize. In June, 1956, and again in June, 1957, George W. Grant and G. Norman Schleinkofer, both of St. Stephen’s Conclave No. 19, (Em - pire of the East) in Haddonflekl, New Jersey, discussed the situation with Harley M. Watkins, who had custody of the old records. They agreed to hold a meeting of Star of Bethlehem Conclave No. r, on July z8, 1957. The meeting was held on that date when George W. Grant, G. Norman Schleinkofer and Arthur B. Fidler, members of St. Stephen’s Conclave No. 19 in New jersey, assisted in part by four members of Star of Bethlehem Conclave No. i, conferred the Orders on twenty-nine candidates. Christie B. Crowell, now living in Sand - wich, Massachusetts, is not listed among the membership of the Con - clave, which at that time (1958) had 31 members. At this meeting a committee, not to exceed five, was ordered am pointed by the Sovereign to e~cplore the matter of joining the United Grand Council, to the end that the Vermont Conclave be under a Grand Council, and to revise the By-Laws of the Conclave. Officers were elected for the ensuing year. With all the Conclaves in the United States (escept Maine) in one Grand Council for the United States, it is hoped that this Con - dave will combine with the United Grand Council and, in time, that Maine will, we trust, do likewise.

NEW JERSEY X. The Grand Imperial Council of the Red Cross of Constantine for the State of New Jersey. There is very little information known concerning the Grand Council formed in New Jersey on May 29, 187g. As there seems to be no printed Proceedings, there is no seal. MThat information there is was obtained from the Proceedings of other Grand Councils and the two national groups. The formation meeting was held in Jersey City and among others, the following were elected: William H. Mcllhanney Grand Sovereign Martin N{. Drohan Grand Viceroy Thomas E.

Chalmers, Past Grand Sovereign of the Grand Council of Pennsylvania, on October 19, 1932, delivered to his Grand Council an historical sketch of this so-called national body. This sketch covers the ground admirably and gives the picture truly. What follows is a copy of Sir Knight Chalmers work, corrected in two or three places for clarification. The meeting statistics are mine. “The Order of the Red Cross of Constantine, as originally intro - duced into the United States, gave rich promise of becoming the most exclusive Masonic organization in America. Grand jurisdictions had been set up in many of our Eastern and mid-Western States, having on their roster the outstanding Masons in these various state jurisdic - tions. “Thcse outstanding leaders of the craft, seeking some new legiti - mate Masonic institution as a means of uniting in one organization the brilliant leadership in Masonry, selected the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine as the vehicle to accomplish their ambition. Their purpose was to Americanize this Order and to that end such leaders of higher Masonry as Sirs Albeit G. Goodall, Robert Macoy, George F. Loder and John D. Williams of New York; Calvin L. Stowell, John L. Young, Charles E. Meyer of Pennsylvania; J. ~. French and Robert B. Smith of Illinois; N. G. Tucker and George E. Boyden of Massachusetts; D. Burnham Tracy and Francis A. Blades of Michigan; John W. Cook and William M. Bristol of Kentucky; James H. Willard of Indiana; Henry D. Bean and Francis H. Bascom of Vermont; Marquis F. King of Maine, and William H. Mcllhanney, M. M. Drohan and Jerome B. Borden of New Jersey, chosen as representatives of their various Soy- ereign Jurisdictions, met in the City of New York on Tuesday evening, June i, 1875, at the call of A. G. Goodall, M. E. Grand Sovereign of the Grand Council of New York to organize a Sovereign Grand Coun - cil of the United States of America. These representatives then organ - ized such Sovereign Grand Council with the following list of distin - guished officers: Sir Albert G. Goodall, New York Al. ill. Soy. Cr. Master Sir Calvin L. Stowell, Penna Al. P. Dep. Gr. Master Sir. D. Burnham Tracy, Mich. M. E. Soy. Gr. Viceroy Sir Christian F. Knapp, Penna Very ill. 1st Lieut. Sir Nathaniel G. Tucker, Mass Very Ill. 2nd Lieut. Sir John W. Cook, Kentucky ill. Grand Treasurer Sir Jonathan J. French, Ill ill. Grand Re gist. Gen. Sir Francis A. Blades, Mich Very Grand Rt. Rev. Prelate Sir Josiah H. Drummond, Maine ill. Grand Chancellor Sir Robert B. Smith, Ill Grand Seneschal Sir John L. Young, Penna ill. Grand Prior Sir William H. Mcllhanney, N. J ill. Grand Chamberlain Sir George F. Loder, New York Ill. Grand Marshal Sir James H. Willard, Indiana ill. Gr. Standard Br. Sir Henry D. Bean, Vermont Ill. Grand Herald Sir George E. Boyden, Mass ill. Cr. Capt. of Guard “This was an attempt by prominent leaders of the craft to organize a Super Jurisdiction unwarranted by the traditions, laws and edicts of the Order of Constantine. It was an attempt to usurp the authority of the several State Jurisdictions in the United States by organizing a Super Grand Body which sought to exercise absolute jurisdiction over the Order of the Grand Cross. Their fear of assuming unlawful Juris - diction over the Grand Cross was discussed at the organization meeting and Sir Francis A. Blades of Illinois was appointed to correspond with the Grand Imperial Council of England in reference to conferring the Order of the Grand Cross. [Two years later a Supreme Grand Chap - ter was formed to control the Grand Cross. This organization will be discussed under a proper heading]. “‘~‘~‘~ A constitution was adopted which acknowledged the weak - ness of its structure, for it expressly admitted its want of jurisdiction over any doubtful powers or any powers by implication mcrely, and all Masonic powers not then granted to it were reserved to the Grand Councils and Subordinate Conclaves of the several states or Knights of the Red Cross individually. They expressly waived power of disci - 76 77"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"pline, admonition, censure, or instruction over the State Grand Coun - cils, nor any legislative powers whatever, not expressly granted, but reserved full jurisdiction over all Conclaves organized by it. This ad - mission of the weakness of its authority was to ultimately ruin and destroy this attempt to control the Order in the United States. “In the Proceedings of this Sovereign Grand Council of the United States of America for the year 1876 a communication from Percy Leigh, 330, the Grand Recorder, the Grand Council of England, under whose authority the Order was introduced into the several states, announced that Sir F. M. Williams, Bart. M. P., the Grand Sovereign of England, could not acknowledge or recognize the new National American Grand Body and had instructed Sir Alfred Creigh, Chief Intendant-General and Representative of the Grand Council of England in the United States, to so notify the various American Conclaves and Sir Alfred Creigh thereupon issued his edict outlawing this new organization and claiming that the Sovereign jurisdiction over the various states still remained in the United Grand Councils of such states. “In spite of this declaration of the Grand Council of England and the Edict issued under its authority, the Sovereign Grand Council con - tinued to function. “At the Grand Conclave rn 1877 a proposed treaty with the Grand Council of England, recognizing the Sovereign Giand Council signed by Sir Alfred Creigh and Sovereign Grand Master C. L. Stowell, was offered and the treaty was adopted. The Grand Council of England thereupon recognized the new Sovereign Grand Council. “The Sovereign Grand Council Proceedings of 1891 reports that its Books of Record and other papers in the hands of the late Sir Al - bert G. Goodall, Register-General, had disappeared, and a careful search had failed to reveal their whereabouts. “After the death of Albert C. Coodall, who was Grand Sovereign at the time of his death, the Grand Viceroy, Win. H. Whiting, called a Grand Conclave which elected Charles A. Delaney, of Buffalo, Grand Sovereign, but at the same Grand Conclave, and before it ad - journed, Sir Win. H. V.Thiting, was elected Grand Sovereign. The conflict produced by this election of two Grand Sovereigns created confusion resulting in protracted disputes and ultimately destroyed the Sovereign Grand Council. Disputes arose over the regularity of the adoption of the new constitution, and Sir Henry Sartain, the Grand Sovereign of the Grand Imperial Council of Pennsylvania, at its an- nual Conclave, held February 28, 1893, openly questioned the status of the Sovereign Grand Master of the United States and questioned the entire proceedings, which resulted in the adoption of the new constitution. “The powerful leaders who instigated the organization of the Sovereign Grand Council of the United States found the desire of a few to control the organization most destructive of the welfare of the Order, and in seeking to destroy those usurping the power of the Order their desire to wrest this power from these self-seeking officers destroyed the Sovereign Grand Council and led to contention between the Sov - ereign jurisdictions of the various states which retarded the growth of the Order and lost to the various jurisdictions the brilliant leadership of these outstanding members of the craft. “The Sovereign Grand Jurisdiction of Pennsylvania was one of the first to recognize the unfortunate mistake in setting up this- super jurisdiction and sought to withdraw from their commitments to the new jurisdiction. At the Grand Imperial Council of Pennsylvania, held February z8, 1893, Sir Henry Sartain, the Grand Sovereign, an - nounced that after the year i88o no meeting of the Sovereign Grand Council of the United States was held until i 891. He also questioned the right of the Sovereign Grand Council to adopt a new constitution in its present form, as without authority from the Sovereign Grand Jurisdiction of the various states, and at that Grand Imperial Council Session a resolution was adopted stating that the State Grand Councils seem to take no special interest in the Sovereign Grand Council; that the Sovereign Grand Council had adopted a new constitution in viola - tion of the constitution of the Sovereign Grand Council; that the Sov - ereign Grand Council had elected as Sovereign Grand Master a broth - er who had not been regularly elected Sovereign of a State Grand Council and had not regularly received the degrees of the Order of Red Cross of Constantine, and that by violating its own constitution it broke the bond between itself and the State Grand Councils; that the Sovereign Grand Council had outlived its period of usefulness to the State Grand Councils and by its recent acts had forfeited the con - fidence of the State Grand Councils and that the Grand Jurisdiction of Pennsylvania renounce all allegiance to the Sovereign Grand Coun - cil of the United States of America and dissolve all connection with that body and resume the independent sovereignty guaranteed to it by the Grand Imperial Conclave of England. 78 79"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"“Upon consideration, the matter was referred to a committee with authority to represent and act for the Grand Council during its recess. This special committee met in Philadelphia, on December 6, 1893, on call of Edward S. Wyckoff, Grand Recorder, with a quorum of the members present. The resolutions breaking with the Sovereign Grand Council and withdrawing the F~ennsylvania Grand Jurisdiction as one of its constituent bodies was adopted by the Committee and the Grand Recorder was directed to promulgate the action of the special commit - tee at once. “Grand Sovereign Edward B. Spencer, in his address at the Grand Imperial Council of Pennsylvania, on March 6, 1894, stated that under the leadership of Charles A. Delaney, of Buffalo, N. Y., the Sovereign Grand Council claimed supreme authority over the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine throughout the entire jurisdiction of the United States and their avowed purpose was the obliteration of all the existing state Grand Councils. The Grand Sovereign then reiterated the sov - ereignty of the Grand Imperial Council and warned the members there - of against the extending of such authority and condemning the Sov - ereign Grand Council for its attempted seizing of control of the Order. The proceedings also contain the letter from the Grand Imperial Coun - cii of Illinois, complimenting the Grand Imperial Council of Pennsyl - vania in denouncing the Sovereign Grand Council and withdrawing as one of its constituent bodies and recommends, as a committee, that the Sovereign Jurisdiction of Illinois concur in the action of the Sov - ereign Grand Jurisdiction of Pennsylvania. “At the 1895 Grand Imperial Council the Resolution of the Grand Imperial Council, held March 6, ~ and adopted by the special com - mittee on December 6, 1893, was adopted and the Grand Jurisdiction of Pennsylvania thereby severed all fraternal relationship with the Sov - ereign Grand Council of the United States of America. “On January 30, r 8~ , the Grand Imperial Council of Illinois withdrew its allegiance to the Sovereign Grand Council by resolution, with Sir George W. Warvelle, Grand Sovereign, presiding. “Inasmuch as the Grand Jurisdictions of Pennsylvania (Dec. 6, 1893), Illinois (Jan. 30, i8q~), Maine (May 8, 1895), and Vermont (June i8, i89~) had preserved the Conclave organizations in their juris - dictions, and having withdrawn any allegiance to the Sovereign Grand Council, that Sovereign Grand Body ceased to exist and failed to function, and has passed the way of so many ili.advised fraternal organi - 80 zations which seek authority far beyond the franchise granted by their constituent members. “On May 8, 1895, at the Grand Imperial Council of Maine, M. I. Grand Sovereign Josiah H. Drummond in his address approved the action of the Grand Imperial Council of Pennsylvania and stated that he ‘regarded it as already dead.’ “On June i8, i89~, the Grand Imperial Council of Vermont by resolution fully concurred with the action taken by the Sovereign Juris - dictions of Pennsylvania and Illinois and denied owing allegiance to the so-called Sovereign Grand Council of the United States. “The contention and mistrust engendered by the Sovereign Grand Council thus brought about the withdrawal of the various State Grand Jurisdictions and it ceased to function and passed into the list of those ill-advised grand organizations which drove fiom its membership ex - cellent constituent bodies through an attempt to grasp too much auth - Ority.” MEETING STATISTICS 1 June 1, 1875 2 June 28, 1876 3 June 20, 1877 4 June 12, 1878 5 June 11, 1879 6 Oct. 11, 1880 7 Oct. 1, 1891 8 Oct. 27, 1892 9 Sept. 15, 1893 10 Sept. 14, 1894 11 Sept. 11, 1895 12 Sept. 22, 1896 13 Aug. 24, 1897 New York, N.

THE SUPREME GRAND CFIAPTER OF THE GRAND CROSS OF CONSTANTINE This organization was formed for the purpose of controlling and conferring the Knight Grand Cross of the Order. The various Grand Councils ceded their rights to confer this decoration to the newly formed body but the parent supreme body in England for the first few years of the existence of the Supreme Grand Chapter did not recognize such a right. In 1911, the Grand Council of Illinois with. drew from the Supreme Grand Chapter and returned to the original 81"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"position of conferring the Grand Cross itself. This caused a bitterness to grow up in the Grand Councils although there were two or three Grand Cross Knights who still stayed in the Supreme Grand Chapter. One of these was George M. Moulton who eventually became its head, in fact the last Grand Sovereign. On September 20, 1921 the Supreme Grand Chapter merged with the so-called Empire of the West, but the Grand Council of Penn - sylvania did not recognize this merger and resorted to conferring the Knight Grand Cross itself. The Empires of the West (so-called) and the East conferred the grade independently. Vermont and Maine, the only other Grand Councils remaining in an independent status did not confer the grade. On June 21, 1877 in Rochester, New York, the Supreme Grand Chapter of the Grand Cross of Constantine was formed by the fol - lowing Knights. 1 Alfred Creigh Pa. 2 Calvin L. Stowell Pa. 3 Christian F.

The election of officers took place and Alfred Creigh, Chief In - tendant General of the United States, installed those present: Calvin L. Stowell Grand Sovereign Christian F. Knapp Grand Viceroy Alfred Creigh Grand Registrar General On June 13, 1878, in Philadelphia, at the second meeting, six were also present (all of those at first meeting except Haight) but Robert B. Smith of Illinois was present. Only Charles E. Meyer and John L. Young, of those nominated for the Grand Cross were present and they were elected and Knighted. The other names were dropped from the roll of candidates. 82 Nothing of consequence was done at the 1879 and i88o meetings. The next meeting was 1890 and the proceedings of 1891 are noted as “Fifth Convention” and 1892 and 1893, “Sixth and Seventh Conven - tion Proceedings.” Somewhere along the line the numberings jumped ten, so that 1900, for instance, became the “Twenty-fourth Annual Convention” whereas it was really the Fourteenth Convention. This continued for the life of the Supreme Grand Chapter, 1913 being the last meeting—the Twenty-seventh—being called the “Thirty-seventh Annual Convention” which it would have been had they met annually from 1877 to 1913. George M. Moulton of Illinois tried, for years, to carry the body which lost its standing, largely due to withdrawal of the largest Grand Council, Illinois. which act Moulton did not approve. On September 20, 1921, in Boston, Massachusetts, Moulton decided to give up his fight and the Supreme Grand Chapter of the Grand Cross “officially” disbanded and the making of Grand Crosses of the Order reverted to the two Grand Councils—Illinois and Pennsylvania. The only other Grand Councils then existing were Maine and Vermont, which have never conferred the Grand Cross. Another oddity is that the 5 th Convention proceedings has a seal on the cover of the Sovereign Grand Council organized a couple of years previously. Robert Macoy printed both preceedings and I assume he either got the cuts mixed or the Supreme Grand Chapter did not have a seal yet. At the “demise” of the Supreme Grand Chapter, an “inventory” of the Grand Cross Knights was made and Illinois listed those living who were recognized as such.

KNIGHT GRAND CROSS RED CROSS OF CONSTANTiNE It is not the purpose here to record the complicated history of the organizations which conferred the Knight Grand Cross of Constan - tine in the United States. This history is by far more of a page con - suming record than its importance warrants, as it concerns about two hundred individuals honored by the appellation Grand Cross of Con - stantine, more than half of whom never saw the Grade conferred nor a ritual of the same. In fact, some of those honored never sat in the body which honored them. From the very introduction of the Red Cross of Constantine in the United States, roughly ninety years ago, there have been heated opinions concerning who had the right to confer or/and control the Grand Cross. In the early years the state Grand Conclaves assumed 84 that right, but it was sparingly conferred until 1892 when a body known as the Supreme Grand Chapter of the Grand Cross became active, with the purpose of controlling the grade. This body adjourned sine die on September 20, 1921 and abjucated its authority to confer the grade to the “Empire of the West,” so-called, and thus ceased to exist. How - ever, the “Empire of the East”, so-called, had re-assumed such an authority, while the Grand Councils of Maine and Vermont, the only two other surviving Grand Councils, never conferred the grade again. The present purpose is to list all those who attained the grade of Knight Grand Cross of Constantine in the United States. The records are scanty, replete with errors, both of omission and commission, and untrustworthy. Outside sources have been used in many instances to check and correct obvious mistakes. In the listing below the date of the Grand Cross is a misnomer in that it is frequently impossible to determine if it is an election, a selec - tion or a conferring date. The state listed refers to a state Conclave or a local Conclave in that state—or, in rare instances, when there is no state Conclave the state of residence is used. If, however, the indivi - dual held membership in either the Empire of the East or the Empire of the West, it is recorded by the use of “E” or “‘N”. Admittedly the list is neither complete nor accurate, but it is the result of an intense research in all available proceedings and records of the Order. So far as is known this is an original attempt to present such a list. The charter grade Knights were made prior to November 11, 1873.

CLANDESTINE BODIES I have before me a notice of meeting—January 17, 1958, for The Rose and Lily Conclave No. ~, Knights of the Red Cross of Constan - tine, International Co-Freemaso~nry, Le Droit Humain, British Federa - tion. This body is in London, England, and meets in the Grand Tem - ple, 10 Ladbroke Terrace. It is composed of men and women in the Co-Masonic Order. * * * In a colored publication of October 13, 1900, the name of which is not included in the quotation, is found the following: “A new and the highest branch of Freemasonry now known in the world was organized among the colored Masons in Washington, D. C. on Saturday, Oct. 6th, 1900, and a Sovereign Grand Council of Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine was organized for North America and the following Grand Officers were elected for a period of three years. These high degrees of Freemasonry of the Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine was lust conferred upon Illustrious John G. Jones (~) of Chicago, Illinois, in Canada, by the Independent Sovereign Grand Council of the Knights of the Red Cross of Constan - tine of Canada and a patent of power and authority was also granted to Illustrious John C. jones (33) to institute a Sovereign Grand Coun - cil of the Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine among the colored Masons in the United States. Illustrious John G. Jones (33)—is to be congratulated upon the fact as being the first and only colored Mas - on in the world who has these high Masonic degrees of Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine conferred upon him. This give the colored Masons in the United States the highest and most exalted (sic!] branch of Freemasonry, noM [sic!] known in the world.” There are so many unexplained references in the above that there is no use taking it seriously at all. There was no such body as the “Independent Sovereign Grand Council of the Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine of Canada.” The first Grand Council in Canada was dormant in 1900 and the present one came into being in 1936. I have seen no other reference to the above mentioned organization in the U.S.A. 94 II DAVID KALAKAUA I — KING OF HAWAIIAN ISLANDS There has been considerable mis-information concerning the van - ous “sovereigns” of the Hawaiian Islands (known also as the Sandwich Islands) and the Masonic attachments of the various Kings. As one of the Kings was a member of the Red Cross of Constantine, some data are appended here: The line of sovereigns is as follows: 1810-1819 Kamehameha 1 1753 May 8, 1819 (an island chieftan) 1819-1824 Kamehameha II Litholiho, eldest son of and his wife died in England) Kaahumanu—Premier—Regent Kamehameha III 1824-1833 1833.1854 1797 July 14, 1824 Kamehameha I; both he Mar. 17, 1814 Dec. 15, 1854 (Kauikeaouli Litholiho—brother of Kamehameha II who reached gove[ning age in 1833) 1854-1863 Kamehameha IV Feb. 9, 1834 Nov. 30, ¶863 (Alexander Litholiho, grandson of Kamehameha I) 1863-1872 Kamehameha V Dec. 11, 1830 Dec. ii, ¶872 (Lot Kamehameha—grandson of Kamehameha I and bro - ther of Kamehameha IV—last of Kamehameha dynasty) 1873-1874 William C.

NEW Yoiuc LODGE No. 330, NEw Yoiuc, N. Y. On Wednesday, December 30, ¶871, a Special Communication of this Lodge was held by authority of a Dispensation issued by M.~ .XV.. Elwood E. Thorne, Grand Master, for the purpose of exemplifying the work of the third degree for the edification and entertainment of Brother, His Royal Highness David Kalakaua, King of the Hawaiian Islands, and a member of Le Progres de l’Oceaniea Lodge No. 124, Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands. King Kalakaua was admitted shortly after nine o’clock, introduced and made a tesponse to the address of welcome of the Master, in which he said of his predecessors, “all of whom were Masons.” The King was accompanied by Brother John M. Kapena, Gover - nor of one of the Hawaiian Islands and a member of Hawaiian Lodge No. 21 of Honolulu, and Brother George M. Totten of the United States Navy, designated to accompany the King and his suite during their stay in the United States. Brother Totten was a member of Vic - toria Lodge No. 1026 (E.G.) of Hong Kong, China. After the King was seated, the Grand Master and the entire Grand Lodge staff was admitted. The usual formalities, incident to such an affair, were carried out and then the third degree was exemplified. Fol - lowing thi~ the Bible, owned by St. John’s Lodge No. i, F. & A. M. of New York, on which Brother George Washington took his oath as the first President of the United States, was exhibited. After viewing the relic the King requested that it be opened to the page as when the oath was administered. He then took the book in his hand and kissed the page, saying “I thank God for this privilege.” On January 5, 1875, the King was proposed for Honorary Member - ship in the Lodge and was elected at the following Communication. An acknowledgment was received from Brother Kalakaua on April zo, ¶875, and spread upon the minutes. It might be noted that in the Scribner Edition of Gould’s History Freemasonry, it says the King received his third degree at the meet- in i8 74 —which, of course, is an error. Tim R~ Ci~oss OF CONSTANTINE On January ~ 1875, King Kalakaua was given the Red Cross Orders in St. John’s Conclave No. r, Chicago, Illinois, and he was made a Viceroy and Soveieign. The Orders were conferred by Jonathan J. French. K.G.C., Past Grand Sovereign and Intendant General. On the following day, Owen Dominis, Governor of one of the Hawaiian Islands, was given the Orders but not the Grand Cross. At a Special Meeting of the Grand Council of the Red Cross of Constantine of Scotland on September io, i88i, the King was made a Knight Grand Cross. It might be that the Owen Dominis mentioned above was John Dominis, the Prince Consort. 96 97"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"III THE LIFE OF CONSTANTINE Published by George Kenning 1874 Early in this book I madd more than one reference to material printed as “History”. Some of the more pertinent items being directly concerned were treated. However, there are innumerable printed tracts of various kinds which have been issued to bolster up the fables already bad enough in themselves. To cover this field of material would take hours of iesearch, but a casual reading of some of this “stuff”, simply shows it to be nothing but wishful thinking, colored to the Nth degree. To show just one of these attempts, a few extracts are made here from a book in my library, The Life of Constantine, pnnted in 187+ the title page of which is reproduced. The Preface is by William Wentworth Little, who resuscitated the Red Cross of Constantine. He writes: “As all orders and degrees in Freemasonry are more or less based upon legends the tiuth of which cannot be mathematically demonstrated, it is not pretended that the Masonic Order of Constantine rests upon any stronger or more reliable foundation. It is however certain that it has existed for a great many years under vaiious titles in Masonic nomenclature, inasmuch as it is referred to in a chart bearing date 1736. In England the Order has ever been independant ol other chivalric bodies connected with the Craft, the record of its seveial Grand Masters from 1788 being still extant, and which includes the names of Lord Rancliffe and the Duke of Sussex. The revival of the Order practically dates from i86~, at which period only two conclaves were working in England. In i866, the present Earl of Bective, M.P., was elected to the sovereignty of the knights, and under his presidency no less than one hundred and ten conclaves in every part of the world have been added to the roll.” Then to give the History of the Order he contents himself with offering an article by Calvin L. Stowell of Pennsylvania, who became the first Grand Sovereign in his state in 1872, having been a member of the Order less than two years. Stowell’s “History” seems to have been culled from Gibbon’s The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire. Using this “source” mater- ial, adding and subtracting here and there to make the “History” look bright. This piece of trash is put forth as a Preface to what purports to be a “third-hand” translation from the original “Life of Constantine” by Eusebius Pamphilus. The “Life” is illustrated by wood-cuts borrowed from a poem in latin hexameters on the Life of Constantine by Jesuit Petrus Main - brunus, some of which we show here.
