Be sure that you am~e always ready to impart of your knowledge to those within your sphere, who stand in need of and are entitled to receive it. Do you desire distinction among your ~Dompanions? Be Sure that your claims to preferment are founded upon superior attainments; let no am - biti6us passion be suffered to induce you to envy or supplant a Companion who may be considered as better qualified for promotion than yourselves; but rather let a laudable emulation induce you to strive to exqeh.each other in improvement and discipline; ever remember - ing that lie who faithfully performs his duty, eveu in a subordinate or private station, is as justly entitled to esteem and respect as he who is invested with supreme authority.

May your oblations of piety and praise be grateful as ~the incense; your hove wam-m as its ftalise, and your chai-ity diffusive as its fragrance. May your hearts be pine as the alta,-, and your conduct acceptedde as the ojferimig. May the exercise of your citarity be as con - stant as the retnrnim~g wants of’ the distressed widow rnd helpless orphan.
