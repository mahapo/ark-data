In a place where there was neither sun nor moon to light it. Q. Explainthistome? A. As the Grand Pontiff never wants any artificial light, the faithful and true brothers, the Sublime Grand Pontiffs, do not want riches or titles to be admitted into the Sublime Degrees, as they prove themselves worthy of admittance by their attachment to Masonry, the faithful discharge of their several obligations, their virtue, and true and sincere friendship for their Brethren in general. Q. What does the draft of this Lodge represent? A. A square city of four equal sides, with three gates on each side, in the middle of which is a tree, which bears 12 different kinds of fruit. The city is suspended as on clouds, and seems to crush a 3 headed serpent. Q. Explain this to me. A. The square city represents Ancient Free Masonry, under the title of Grand Pontiff, which comes down from heaven to replace the Ancient Temple, which is represented by the ruins and the 3 headed serpent underneath. Q. How comes Masonry to have fallen into ruin, since we are bound to support it, and are attached to it by our obligations, which cannot be equivocal? A. It was so decreed in old times, which we learn from the writings of St. John. whom we know to have been the first Mason who held a Lodge of Perfection. Q. Where does St. John say this? A. In his revelation, where he speaks of Babylon and the celestial Jerusalem. Q. What signifies the tree, with the 12 different fruits, which stands in the center of the square city? 226 Iw"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Grand Pontiff, or Sublime Scotch Masonry be... A.

Q. What is the meaning of satin fillet with the 12 golden stars, which the Candidate wore round his forehead’? A. It procures those who wear it an entrance into our Lodge, as it likewise procures the entrance of those who wear it, into the celestial Jerusalem, as St. John himself informs us. Q. What is the meaning of the 12 Golden stars on the fillet of the Candidate, and on those of the Brethren? A. They represent the 12 Angels, who watched at the 12 Gates of the celestial Jerusalem. Q. What signify the blue hangings, with the golden stars thereon’? A. The blue is the symbol of Lenity, Fidelity, and sweemess, which ought to be the share of every faithful and true Brother—And the Stars represent those Masons, who have given proof of their attachment to the Statutes and rules of the order, which in the end, will make them deserving of entering into the celestial Jerusalem.

The Grand Master General of the order, who is styled, Knight Prince Grand Commander, is the most Illustrious Frederick of Brunswick, King of Prussia, whose ancestors have for 300 years, been the protectors of the said order, which is celebrated by the Prussian Knights, in memory of the building of the tower of babel, and the confusion of tongues which happened there.

The Lieutenant Commander then addresses himself to the Knights and says— “Brother Knights, I here present to you a perfect Master of Hiram, who is desirous of becoming a Prussian Knight. Do you consent that he shall be received?” All the Knights immediately draw their swords, and, plunge them towards the Candidate, without speaking—which is the mode established of expressing their approbation. Then the Lieutenant Commander says to the Candidate—”In the name of all the Prussian Knights, as well those who are here present, as those who are dispersed over the two Hemispheres, I consent to your request, provided you will renounce pride and ostentation during the rest of your life.

The Descendants of Noah, notwithstanding the covenant with God, of which the rainbow was given as a sign, that he never would destroy the sons of man again by a general Deluge, resolved to build a Tower so high that they could thereby defy the divine vengeance of the Almighty, and chose for that purpose a plain called Shinar in Asia. Ten years after they had laid the foundation of the Edifice, the Lord (says the historian) cast his eyes upon the 250"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"...i~ Patriarch Noachite, or Chevalier Prussian ~‘.. earth, and saw the pride of the Sons of Man, and descended upon the Earth to confound the rash audacious attempts of his people and caused a confusion of Languages among the workmen, so that they were unintelligible to each other. It is from this circumstance that the Edifice was called the Tower of Babel. which signifies confusion. Sometime after, Nimrod, who was the first who established Royalty and Distinctions among men, to avenue the right and the homage and adoration which is due to the Divinity, founded a city, and called it Babylon—that is, Ancient confusion. It was in the night of the full Moon in March that God caused this miracle, which is the reason that the Prussian Knights or Noachites, hold their Grand Assembly every year, on the night of the full Moon in March. A Chapter for initiation or instruction is held every Month, on the night of the full Moon. As the workmen could no longer understand each other, they separated themselves and each took a different way. Peleg, who gave the plan, and was the founder and director of the Building was the most culpable, condemned himself to a rigorous penance. and retired from the sinful spot, into the North, now called Germany, where he arrived after undergoing much labor, trouble and fatigue in crossing deserts, and dreary woods, in which he found nothing for sustenance, but the roots of the Earth, and the wild fruits of the fields. In that part of the Country which is now called Prussia, he fixed himself, and with great labor constructed several Huts to shelter himself from inclement seasons, and after some time, he built himself a small triangular Temple, in which he used to shut himself up, to implore the mercy and forgiveness of God, for the sins he had committed. In the year 1553 in digging for salt mines which are often found in Prussia, they discovered the ruins of a triangular Edifice 15 Cubits deep, in the center of which stood a column of White marble, on its Base was engraved in Syriac Characters the whole history of the penitent Peleg. On the side of the Column, they found a Coffin of Grey Stone, in which they perceived some dust. and a 251"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Patriarch Noachite, or Chevalier Prussian ~. black agate stone, in which was engraven the following Epitaph in Syriac Characters — “Here lies the ashes of the great Architect of the Tower of Babel. The Lord had compassion on him, because he became humble and penitent.” Besides this stone there were several others, with characters cut in them on the one of triangular form was cut in Syriac characters which was not interpreted until the reign of his majesty Frederick the 3id, the present King of Prussia, informing us that the world we inhabit, existed for 9000 years before the birth of Adam. The engraving on another stone informs us that our forefathers had built many Edifices under ground, to prevent the Temples of the living God from being profaned by the Infidels, and that the Temple of Enoch was the first. There were also found six other stones of white marble, with Syriac characters, which cannot be explained, until the true elected shall be united, under the banners of One Sovereign and one Law, which is that practiced by the Knights Adepts, which degree will bring you to the knowledge of it, but previously to receiving it, we must crush the foul serpent of Ignorance and prejudice in matters of religion and all the worshippers of the Uving God with an eye of fraternal tenderness, however different their modes and forms of worship may be, in full hope and expectation of receiving Eternal Beatitude. All these curious pieces of Agate, Marble, the Coffin and Column are deposited in the Archives of the King of Prussia in a secret place. The Epitaph does not say that Peleg was the Architect of the Tower of Babel, but the inscription on the base of the column, informs us that Peleg was the son of Eber, who was the son of Salah, who was the son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the oldest son of Noah. Now my Brother, you are instructed in a part of our Mysteries, and have received information which you could not have obtained from any other source, and as unknown to all the profane, who have never been admitted into this degree. I have now confided to you an important and useful information—because of indiscretion, conceal from vulgar minds a knowledge of our rich treasure, and should you be so rash and indiscreet, as to commit yourself, follow the 252"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"...v Patriarch Noachite, or Chevalier Prussian ~‘- example of the great Peleg in practicing humility, and these Lessons which are given by the Knights Philosophers, Knights Adepts of the Sun. The Noachites, are now called Prussian Knights, and are descendants of Peleg, Architect of the Tower of Babel. therefore the origin of this Order, is long before the ~Era of Hiram or Solomon, as the Tower of Babel was built many centuries before the Temple of Solomon. In former ages it was not required that a Candidate should be a Master Mason of Hiram, but in the time of the Crusades, The Knights of the different orders in Europe were initiated into this degree, by the Christian princes, who were arrived to conquer the Holy Land, which was invaded by the infidels. The Masonic descendants of Hiram, from the affection which subsisted between them and the Noachites, who were much esteemed were desirous of being initiated into this order and they were accordingly admitted Prussian Knights agreeably to the Mysteries, and from that time, a Candidate cannot be admitted unless his is at least a Perfect Mason, according to the Statutes and Regulations of the order, which are also deposited in the Archives of the King of Prussia. It is strictly prohibited by the Statutes of our order, to make use of any tables, eating or drinking, or any artificial light in this Chapter. except an artificial Moon. But the Ueutenant Knight Commander, may hold a Lodge table of Companions of Hiram, on which, nothing can be served up that had life, and the collation must consist of Roots, Fruits and Vegetables, in memoiy of the penitent Peleg who subsisted on Vegetables during his penance.

The Samaritans assisted in bringing the timbers down from the Mount, to the sea side, to be transported from thence to Joppa. These zealous descendants have since been employed to fell the timbers of the mountain for the construction of the 2!d Temple, by the orders of Cyrus, Darius, and Xerxes, under the direction of Zerubbabel. This celebrated Nation formed on the said mountain, Colleges or meetings, and always in their works adored the Great Architect of the Universe.

It is to these Conductors and Ancient patriarchs, we owe the Knowledge of these events, in succession of time, since the Deluge. In the earliest ages of time, Colleges were established in the Mountain, for the construction of the ark of the Covenant, and in some ages after, the same Colleges were held for the construction of Solomon’s Temple. That wise King ordered a small palace to be built on Mount Lebanon, which when finished, he used to go to see what progress the workmen had made in Hewing and squaring the Cedars.

Adam addresses the Candidate—My Son, since you have by your labors in the Royal Art arrived at the point of deserving a knowledge of Truth, she must be shewn to you in her native colors. Consult yourself at this moment—see if you are sufficiently willing to obey her in every thing which she shall enjoin. If you are now, such as I wish you to be, I am, persuaded she is already in your heart, and that you must feel some sensations, which were before unknown to you. If that is the case, you may hope that she will not long delay to manifest herself to you. But take care that you do not come to defile her sanctuary by a silly spirit of curiosity and beware of augmenting the number of the profane who have so long ill treated her, as even to oblige her to conceal herself and no longer to appear on earth, but under a thick veil, from which her feet are scarcely discovered. She will always conceal her glory, and will not suffer her face to be uncovered, except to true Free Masons, that is to say, to the true extirpators of superstition and falsehood. I hope my dear Brother, that you will become one of her intimate favorites: The trials through which you have passed, sufficiently assure me of what I ought to expect from your zeal; therefore that nothing may be hid from you.

SQUARE 285"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"...‘~ Grand Knight of the Sun, or Prince Adept b’.. AND COMPASS have a signification which you have not hitherto been able to comprehend. BY THE BIBLE you are to understand, that you are to be guided by no other law than that, which governed Adam at the Time of his creation and which the Eternal engraved on his heart. That you are to make no distinction in religious sects, and as Masons, it is indispensably our desire to acknowledge and adore that great and Beneficent Being, which has the Heavens for his couch, and the Earth for his footstool. All that God has created is good, and in him there can be nothing wrong. He hath made every thing right, even as with a COMPASS we form a circle, of which all the points of the circumference are at an equal distance from the central point: God then is the central power of all things, all other things form component parts of our Circle. By the SQUARE you are also taught to believe that this same God hath made all things in due proportion. Thus, as it would be impossible to make anything round by forming it with a square, the proportion of which is to form as figure with four sides and right angles. Even so the Eternal in creating the World by his own power, could have had but one intention, and have acted accordingly, that is to say, in one manner only, and that perfectly right. You were also shown a LEVEL A PLUMB AND AN UNHEWN STONE. BY THE LEVEL you will learn to be upright and square, not suffer yourself to be led away by the crowd of the ignorant and blind, to be firm and inflexible in supporting the rights of the natural Law, and the pure and unsophisticated knowledge of Holy truth. BY THE PLUMB and UNHEWN STONE you are to understand man in his rough, uninitiated state, polished by reason and brought to perfection by the assistance of our Masters. You have seen a plate for designing. This represents to you a man occupied in the act of thinking and who employs his reason in nothing but what is just and reasonable. Compared also to an unhewn stone, which signifies that all our actions, should be uniformly directed to the Sovereign God. BY THE Two COLuMNS we are to endeavor to become ornaments of our Order, that is of enlightened Brethren to serve as Beacons to them. These 286"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"A Grand Knight of the Sun, or Prince Adept ~‘- columns also are like the pillars of Hercules. These pillars were said to fix the boundaries of the world. Our columns signify that Masonry is the boundary or limit of the Human understanding. You have seen that bright BLAZING STAR in the Middle Chamber where the Master Masons were paid, which afterwards served as the Holy place, in which the Ark was shut up. This emblem points out to you, that you ought to apply yourself, to the making of you pure and proper, to admit Truth, that is, that you may be fixed as in a Tabernacle, as there it is that she will recompense you with her most precious gifts. You also saw another STAR. It signifies that a true Mason by perfecting himself in the paths of virtue, will resemble a brilliant star, which gives light amidst the thickest darkness: that is, he will become useful to those who listen to him and who are disposed to profit by his instructions. You have also obtained a knowledge of the Masons of Hiram, and of the words & signs which were substituted in room of those, which were believed to have been extorted, but which, the assassins were not able to obtain the least knowledge of, as was afterwards clearly ascertained. Let this example be an useful lesson to you to be on your guard! Be assured that it is very difficult to escape the snare which are daily laid to entrap you by Ignorance and Envy. Let it remind you that the Most virtuous men, are frequently deceived, but that in such unfortunate cases we ought to be as firm as was our respected Master Hiram, who preferred being massacred to yielding to their importunities. Wherefore, when Truth shall once be heard in the inmost recesses of your heart, you ought not to hesitate, on your part which you have to take, you should be ready to die to maintain those rights by which the Sovereign good is obtained, and never expose yourself to the discovery of your secrets in your conversations with the profane: Be circumspect even with those who are most initiated in our mysteries. Do not discover yourself, to any persons whomsoever, until you are perfectly well acquainted with the character & manner of such Brethren, as may appear to you prepared to be admitted into the sacred sanctuary where Holy Truth utters her divine oracles.

By the GRAVE & CORPSE, you are to understand mankind in the state which you were, before you had the happiness of being initiated into our Order. The CORD to draw our the Corpse, is the Bond which draws us from the bosom of Ignorance, that we may arrive at the Celestial abode, where Truth resides and represents also the true Mason who rises by degrees to the highest Heaven, there to be absorbed by the holy and unchangeable name of the Supreme Being. In the Degree of MAITRE ANGLAIS (English Master) or MAITRE PARISIEN (Parisian Master) you saw a blazing star, a large candlestick with seven branches, and altar, purifying vases, & a large brazen sea: By this degree you are to learn, that we must be cleansed from bitterness of sin, before we can pass to other degrees we must feel ourselves capable of having brilliant light of reason emitted by Truth, of which this star is an emblem. The candlestick of seven branches designates the essential number of the Royal Art, in which seven Brethren, may imitate on of the profane who desires to emerge from darkness, and impart to him seven gifts of the spirit, which will be fully shewn to you when you shall have been cleansed and purified in the brazen sea. In the degree of MAITRE IRLANDES DU PR~VOT EU JUGE (Irish Master of the Provost & Judge) you saw a small box suspended, a Key, a pair of scales and a lighted urn. This degree teaches you the manner in which you ought to combat your passions & that you should be with respect to them as a Provost and a severe Judge: by the box you are instructed in the grand observance of keeping the secret which you have lodges in your heart and to cover it with a dark veil, that is to say, so to act as that the profane may never obtain the least knowledge of 288"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"...“ Grand Knight of the Sun, or Prince Adept i’.. it. By the KEY you are taught that you have already been instructed in part of the mysteries and that by conducting yourself towards your Brethren sincerely with fervor and zeal, you will soon arrive at a knowledge of the general good of the society. The SCALES AND THE LIGHTED URN represent to you that you are not to rest satisfied with the sublime knowledge which you have obtained, but that you should also by your means and your actions leave after you on the minds of your Brethren, and even of the profane, a high idea of your virtues, and see that your knowledge and reputation shall enlighten and perfume as far as does materially, the Urn filled with lighted perfumes. In the degree of D’EcossAIs DE PARIS (Scotch of Paris) you have seen many things, which were merely a repetition of what you had already gone through: however, you there met with three J.J.J. enclosed in a Triangle, the planet Mercury, the 31d Chamber called Gabaon, the Ladder made in the shape of a screw [winding ladder] the figure of Solomon, and that of J&B. By the 3 J you leam the sacred names of the attributes of the Eternal, the seven winding steps represent the different degrees through which you must pass to arrive at the height of Glory represented by the Mount Gabaon, on which sacrifices were offered to the Most High. Being arrived on this mount you are to make a sacrifice of your passions and do nothing but what is prescribed by our laws. The planet mercury, the fabulous God of robbers, is an emblem of distrust, serving to caution you to show such of your Brethren, who totally forgetful of their duty, associate with wicked men, and who most frequently seem not to recollect our sacred mysteries, in other words to avoid those who by their worldly habits indicate to us, that they are ready to disown their engagements. The arch near which you are now arrived, teaches you that being admitted into the Holy of Holies, that you ought to resolve rather to perish like our Grand Master Hiram, who was there interred, than to betray the Mysteries of the order. The figure of Solomon, the founder of the Order, is presented to you as a pattern to follow. John the Baptist teaches you to become an apostle of the order, that is, that you should perform secret missions among men who you 289"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"..“ Grand Knight of the Sun, or Prince Adept b.-. may think qualified to enter into the path of Truth, that they may arrive at a full knowledge of her. In the Grade of FAVORI (Favorite Degree) you saw the two Kings embracing, their regret at the loss of one of their Brethren, a golden blade, the guards, a man seized and about to suffer death for having listened in. The conversation between the two Kings represents the connection between our laws and the Law of Nature, which perfectly accord with each other. The regret & the tears of the two Kings are figurative of the regret which you feel when any of your Brethren go astray from the paths of virtue. He who was listening, discovered, seized and led to punishment is an emblem of those who have been initiated into our sacred mysteries from motives of curiosity, and having been discovered are fore ever banished from our sanctuaries, and if they should be such villains as to be indiscreet we have a right by every means, even the most secret, to take vengeance on them for their perfidy. Let us pray to the Eternal to preserve our order from such misfortunes. In the degree of Master Elect, you must have remarked that from among all the favorites in the Chamber of Solomon. there were but nine, who were elected to avenge the death of our respectable Master Hiram. This will give you an idea of what passes in our Lodge. Many of the profane have the happiness of entering into our sanctuary, but few are so happy as to arrive at a knowledge of the sublime Truth. 290"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"I ~ 1~egree of the ~2”’~ eerie.

Because there is one single light that shines among men, who have the happiness of going from the darkness of ignorance and of the vulgar prejudices, to follow the only light that leads to the celestial truth. The light that is in our Council, is composed of a glass globe filled with water and a light placed behind it, and therefore renders the light more clear. The glass of reflection, the globe, when it is lighted, is placed in the South. The Grand Master or Thrice Puissant, is named “Father Adam,” who is placed in the east, vested in a robe of pale yellow like the morning. He has his hat on, and in his right hand a scepter, on the top of which is a globe of gold; the handle or extremity of the scepter also gilt. The reason that Adam carries the globe above the scepter in this Council is, because he was constituted Sovereign Master of the Worid, and created Sovereign Father of all men. He carries a Sun suspended by a chain of gold around his neck, and on the reverse of this jewel of gold is a globe. When this degree is given, no jewel or apron is worn. There is only one Warden, whose name is Brother Truth, he sits in the west opposite Father Adam and entitled with the same ornaments as Father A darn— 291"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun v-.. he wears besides a large white watered ribbon, as a collar, with an eye of gold embroidered or painted thereon, above the gold chain sun.

ZAPHRIEL, ZABRIEL, CAMAEL, URIEL, MICHAEL, ZAPI-LAEL & GABRIEL These ought to be decorated in the same manner as the Thrice Puissant Father Adam. If there are more than that number of the Knights of the Sun, they go by the name of Sylphs, and are the preparers of the Council and assistants in all the ceremonies or operations of the Lodge. They are entitled to the same jewel, but have a ribbon of a fiery color tied to the third buttonhole of their coats. §. To Open the Grand Council. Father Adam says— Brother Truth what time is it on earth? A. Mighty Father, it is midnight among the profane or Cowans, but the sun is in its meridian in this Lodge. Father Adam—My dear children, profit by the favor of this austere luminary, at present showing its light to us, which will conduct us in the path of virtue and to follow that law which is eternally to be engraved on our hearts, and the only law by which we cannot fail to come to the knowledge of pure truth. He then makes a sign by putting his right hand on his left breast, on which all the Brethren put ~.q, the first finger of the right hand above their heads, the other fingers clinched, shewing by that there is but one God, who is the beginning of all truth. Then Father Adam says—This Lodge is opened. When Father Adam says—to order Brethren, they all put their right hands on their hearts, and he puts up his first finger and so VISA VERSA. 292"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":".“ Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun ~.. §. Form of Reception. After the Council is opened, the Candidate is introduced into an antechamber where there are a number of Sylphs, each with a bellows, blowing a large pot of fire, which the Candidate sees, but they take no notice of him. After he is left in this situation two or three minutes, the most ancient of the Sylphs goes to the Candidate and covers his face with black crepe. He must be without a sword, and is told that he must find the door of the Sanctuary, and when found, to knock on it 6 times with an open hand. After he finds the door and knocks, Brother Truth goes to the door, and having opened it a little, asks the Candidate the following questions, which he answers by the help of the Sylphs. Q. What do you desire? A. I desire to go out of darkness to see the true light, and to know the true light in all its purity. Q. What do you desire more? A. To divest myself of original sin, and destroy the juvenile prejudices of error, which all men are liable to, namely, the desires of all worldly attachments and pride. On which Brother Truth comes to Father Adam, and relates what the Candidate has told him, when Father Adam gives orders to introduce the Candidate to the true happiness. Then Brother Truth opens the doo, and takes the Candidate by the hand, and conducts him to the middle of the Lod~’e cw Sanctuary, which is also covered by a black cloth, when Father Adam a~sses him:— “My son, seeing by your labor in the royal art, you are now come to the desire of knowledge of the pure and holy truth, we shall lay it open to you without any disguise or covering. But before we do this, consult your heart and see in this moment if you feel yourself disposed to obey her, (namely truth) in all things which she commands. If you are disposed, I am sure she is ready in your heart, and you must feel an emotion that was unknown to you before. h 293"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun v-.. This being the case, you must hope that she will not be long to manifest herself to you. But have a care not to defile the Sanctuary by a spirit of curiosity, and take care not to increase the number of the vulgar and profane, that have for a long a time ill-treated her, until Truth was obliged to depart the earth and now can hardly trace any of her footsteps. But she always appears in her greatest glory without disguise, to the true, good and honest Free Masons, that is to say, to the zealous extirpators of superstition and lies. I hope, my dear Brother, you will be one of her intimate favorites. The proofs that you have given, assure me of every thing I have to expect of your zeal, for as nothing now can be more a secret between us, I shall order Brother Truth, that he will instruct you what you are to do in order to come to true happiness.” After this discourse of Father Adam, the Candidate is unvailed and shown the form of the Lodge or Council, without explaining any part thereof Brother Truth then proceeds (vizt.)— “My dear Brother, by mouth, holy truth speaketh to you, but before she can manifest herself to you, she requires of you proofs in which she is satisfied in your entrance in the Masonic order. She has appeared to you in many things, which you could not have apprehended or comprehended without her assistance; but now you have the happiness to arrive at the brilliant day, nothing can be a secret to you. Learn, then, the moral use that is made of the 3 first parts of the furniture~vizt: Bible, Compass and Square. Bible. — By the Bible, you are to understand, that it is the only law you ought to follow. It is that which Adam received at his creation, and which the Almighty engraved in his heart. This law is called NATURAL LAW, and shews positively that there is but one God, and to adore him only without any subdivision or interpolation. Compass.—The Compass gives you the faculty of judging for yourself, that whatever God has created, is well, and he is the sovereign author of every thing. Existing in himself, nothing is either good or evil, because we understand by this expression, an action done which is excellent in itself, is 294"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"....“ Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun ~. relative and submits to the human understanding, judgment to know the value and price of such action, and that God, with whom everything is possible, communicates nothing of his will, but such as his great goodness pleases; and everything in the universe is governed as he has decreed it, with justice, being able to compare it with the attributes of the Divinity. I equally say that in himself there is no evil, because he has made every thing with exactness, and that every thing exists according to his will, consequently as it ought to be. The distance between good and evil with the Divinity, cannot be more justly and clearly compared than by a circle formed with a compass from the points being reunited there is formed an entire circumference; and when any point in particular equally approaches or equally separates from its point, it is only a faint resemblance of the distance between good and evil, which we compare by the points of a compass forming a circle, which circle when completed, is GOD. Square. —By the Square we discover that God who made every thing equal, in the same manner as you are not able to dig a body in a quarry complete, or perfect; thus the wish of the Eternal in creating the world by a liberal act of his own well foresaw every matter that could possibly happen in consequence thereof; that is to say, that every thing therein contained at the same time of the creation was good. Level—You have also seen a Level, a Plumb, and a rough Stone. By the level you are to leam to be upright and sincere, and not to suffer yourself to be drawn away by the multitude of the blind and ignorant people; to be always firm and steady to sustain the right of the natural law, and the pure and real knowledge of that truth which it teacheth. Perpendicular and rough stone. — By these you ought to understand the prejudiced man made polished by reason, and put censure away by the excellence of our Master. Trestle board. —You have seen the trestle board, to draw plans on. This represents the man whose whole occupation is the art of thinking, and employs his reason to that which is just and reasonable. I 295"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"—‘w Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun v... Cubic stone. —You have seen the cubic stone, the moral of which, and the sense you ought to draw from it, is to rule your actions, that they might be equally brought to the sovereign good. Pillars.—The two pillars teach you that all Masons ought to attach themselves firmly to become an ornament to the order, as well as to its support—as the pillars of Hercules formerly determined the end of the ancient world. Blazing Star.—You have seen the blazing star, the moral sense of which is, a true Mason perfecting himself in the way of truth that he may become like a blazing star which shineth equally during the thickest darkness; that is to say, it is useful to those that it shineth upon, and who are ready and desirous of profiting by its light. The first instructions have conducted you to the knowledge of Hiram Abiff, and the inquiries that were made in finding him out. You have been informed of the words, signs, and tokens which were substituted to those we feared would have been surprised, but of which they afterwards learnt, that the treacherous villains had not been able to receive any knowledge of, and this ought to be an example and salutary advice to you, to be always on your guard, and well persuaded that it is difficult to escape the snares that ignorance, joined to conceited opinion, lay every day against us, and thereby to overcome us; and the most virtuous men are liable to fall, because their candor renders them unsuspecting: but in this case you ought to be firm, as our Respectable Father, Hiram, who chose rather to be massacred than to give up what he had obtained. This will teach you that as soon as truth shall be fixed in your heart, you ought never to consider the resolution you should take, you must live and die to obtain the light, by which we acquire the sovereign good; we must never expose ourselves to the conversation of Cowans, and must be circumspect even with those with whom we are the most intimate, and not to deliver up ourselves to any, excepting those whose character and behavior have proved them brothers, who are worthy to come and appear in the sacred sanctuary, where holy truth delivers her oracles. 296"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"...“ Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun p.. - You have passed the Secret & Perfect Master, the 4~ & 5 th degrees of Masonry; you have been decorated with an ivory key, a symbol of your distinction; you have received the pronunciation of the Ineffable name of the Great Architect of the universe, and have been placed at the first balustrade of the Sanctuary; you have had rank among the Levites, after you knew the word ZIZON, which signifies a balustrade of the Levites, where all those are placed as well as yourself, to expect the knowledge of the sublime mysteries. Coffin and Rope.—ln the Degree of Perfect Master, they have shown you a grave, a coffin, and a “whith rope,” to raise and deposit the body in a sepulcher, made in the form of a pyramid, in the top of which is a triangle, and within which was the sacred name of the Eternal, and on the pavement were the two columns of Jachin and Boaz laid across. Ivory Key. — By the ivory key you are to understand that you cannot open your heart with safety, but at proper times. By the corpse and grave is represented the state of man, before he had known the happiness of our order. Rope. —The rope to which the coffin is tied, in order to raise it, is the symbol of raising a unit, as you have been raised from the grave of ignorance to the celestial place where truth resides. Pyramid.—The Pyramid represents the true Mason who raises himself by degrees, till he reaches heaven, to adore the sacred and unalterable name of the Eternal Supreme. Intimate Secretary. —This new degree leads you near to Solomon and honor, and after you redoubled your zeal you gained new honors and favors, having nearly lost your life by curiosity; which attachment to Masonry gave you the good qualities of your heart, and which found you grace and led you to the Intendant of the Buildings, and where you saw a blazing star, a large candlestick with seven branches, with altars, vases, and purification, and a great brazen sea. Blazing star. — By the expression of purification. you are to understand that you are to be cleansed from impiety and prejudice, before you can acquire more of the sublime knowledge in passing the other degrees to be able to support the 297"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun ~ brilliant light of reason, enlightened by truth, of which the blazing star is the figure. Candlestick and seven branches. — By the candlestick with 7 branches, you are to remember the mysterious number of the 7 Masters who were named to succeed one, and from that time it was resolved that seven Knights of Masonry, united together. were able to initiate into Masonry, and show them the 7 gifts of the Eternal, which we shall give you a perfect knowledge of, when you have been purified in the brazen sea. Brazen Sea.—You have passed from the Secret and Perfect Master to the Intimate Secretary, Provost and Judge, and the Intendant of the Buildings. ln these degrees, they have showed you an ebony box, a key suspended, a balance, and an inflamed urn. Ebony box. —The ebony box shows you with what scrupulous attention you are to keep the secrets that have been confided to you, and which you are to reserve in the closet of your heart, of which the box an emblem. And were you to reflect on the black color of said box, it would teach you to cover your secrets with a thick vail, in such a manner that the profane Cowans cannot possibly have any knowledge there of. Ke)~—The key demonstrates that you have already obtained a key to our knowledge and a part of our mysteries, and if you behave with equity, fervor and zeal to your brothers, you will arrive shortly to the knowledge and meaning of our society, and this indicates the reason of the balance. Inflamed urn.—By the inflamed urn you are to understand that as far as you come to the knowledge of the Royal and Sublime Art, you must, by your behavior, leave behind you, in the minds of your Brethren and the vulgar, a high idea of your virtue, equal to the perfume of the burning urn. Two kings. — In the degree of Intimate Secretary you have seen and heard two kings, who were entering into their new alliance and reciprocal promise, and of the perfection of their grand enterprise. They spoke of the death of Hiram Abiff, our Excellent Master & you saw guards and a man overseen, and ready to be put to death for his curiosity of peeping. You also heard of the 298"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"....“ Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun ~‘-. prospect of a plan called the vault, to deposit the precious treasure of Masonry, when the time should be fulfilled, and you afterwards became a Brother. The conversation of the two kings, is the figure and report that our laws must hold with the natural law, which forms a perfect agreement with the conveniences, and promises to those who shall have the happiness to be contracted to you in the same manner and perfect alliance, they will afterwards come to the center of true knowledge. Tears.—The tears and regret of the two kings are the emblem of the regret you ought to have when you perceive a Brother depart from the road of virtue. The man peeping.—By the man you saw peeping, and who was discovered, and seized, and conducted to death, is an emblem of those who come to be initiated into our sacred mysteries through a motive of curiosity; and if so indiscreet as to divulge their obligations, we are bound to cause their death, and take vengeance on the treason by the destruction of the traitor. Let us pray the Eternal to preserve our order from such an evil you have hereof seen an example in the 9~ degree, to which you are come, by your fervor, zeal, and constancy. In that degree you have remarked, that from all the favorites that were at that time in the apartments of Solomon, only nine were elected to avenge the death of Hiram Abiff; this makes good that a great many are often called, but few chosen. To explain this enigma~—a great many of the profane have the happiness to divest themselves of that name to see and obtain the entrance in our sanctuary, but very few are constant, zealous, and fervent to merit the happiness of coming to the height and knowledge of the sublime truth. If you ask me what are the requisite qualities that a Mason must be possessed of to come•to the center of truth, I answer you, that you must crush the head of the serpent of ignorance. You must shake off the yoke of infant prejudice, concerning the mysteries of the reigning religion, which worship has been imaginary, and only founded on the spirit of pride. which envies to command and be distinguished, and to be at the head of the vulgar, in affecting ‘4 an exterior purity, which characterizes a false piety, joiDed to a desire of 299"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"...w Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun ~. acquiring that which is not its own, and is always the subject of this exterior pride, and unalterable source of mans disorders, which being joined to gluttonness, is the daughter of hypocrisy, and employs every matter to satisfy carnal desires, and raises to these predominant passions, altars, upon which she maintains without ceasing, the light of iniquity, and sacrifices continually offerings to luxury, voluptuousness, hatred, envy, and perjury. Behold, my Brother, what you must fight against and destroy, before you can come to the knowledge of the true good and sovereign happiness. — Behold this monster which you must conquer—a serpent which we detest as an idol that is adored by the idiot and vulgar, under the name of Religion. Solomon, King Hiram, and Sr. John the Baptist. — In the Degrees of Elected of 15, Illustrious Knights, Grand Master Architects, and the Royal Arch, you have seen many things which are only a repetition of what you have already examined. You will always find in those degrees, initial letters enclosed in different triangles, or Deltas. You have also seen the planet Mercury, the chamber called GABAON, or the Third Heaven, the winding staircase—the ark of alliance—the tomb of Hiram Abiff facing the ark and the urn—the precious treasure found by the assiduous travelers—the three zealous Brethren Masons—the punishment of the haughty Master Mason, in being buried under the ancient ruins of Enoch—and finally you have seen the figures of Solomon, and Hiram, King of Tyre, and St. John the Baptist. By the 3. J.J.J. you know the three sacred names of the Eternal, and mount Gabaon, where you came to by 7 degrees which compose the winding staircase. The 7 stars represent the seven principal and different degrees to which you must come to attain the height of glory represented by the mount, where they formerly sacrificed to the Most High. When you arrive to that, you are to subdue yourself in your passions, in not doing any thing that it is not prescribed in our laws. By the planet Mercury, you are taught continually to mistrust, shun, and run away from those, who, by a false practice maintain commerce with people of a 300"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":".-~‘ Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun p... vicious life, who seem to despise the most sacred mysteries; that is, to depart from those, who by the vulgar fear, or have a bad understanding, and are ready to deny the solemn obligations that they have contracted among us. When you come to the foot of our arch, you are to apprehend that you come to the Sanctum Sanctorum. You are not to return, but rather to persist in sustaining the glory of our order, and the truth of our laws, principles, and mysteries in like manner as our Respectable Father, Hiram Abiff, who deserved to have been buried there for his constancy and fidelity. We have also, another example in the firmness of Gaiaad, the son of Sophina. chief of the Levites, under Surnain, the High Priest, as mentioned in the history of peifection. Leani in this moment, my dear Brother, what you are to understand by the figures of Solomon, Hiram, King of Tyre, and St. John the Baptist. The two first, exert you, by their zeal in the royal art, to follow the sublime road of which Solomon was the institutor, and Hiram, King of Tyre, the supporter; a title legitimately due to that King, who not only protected the order, but contributed with all his might to the construction of the temple which Solomon built to the honor of the Almighty. The 3~, or St. John the Baptist, teaches you to preach marvelous of this order, which is as much as to say, you are to make secret missions among men., which you believe to be in a state of entering the road of truth, that they may be able one day to see her virtues and visage uncovered. Hiram Abiff, was the symbol of truth, on earth. Jubelum Akirop was accused by the serpent of ignorance, which to this day raises altars in the hearts of the profane and fearful. This profaneness, backed by a fanatic zeal, becomes an instrument to the religious reign, which struck the first stroke in the heart of our dear Father, Hiram Abiff; which is as much as to say, undermined the foundation of the celestial temple, which the Eternal himself had ordered to be raised to the sublime truth and his glory. The first stage of the world has been witness to what I have advanced. The simple, natural law rendered to our first fathers the most uninterrupted happiness; they were in these times more virtuous, but so soon as the monster 301"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun ~. of pride started up in the air, and disclosed herself to those unhappy mortals, she promised to them every seat of happiness, and seduced them by her soft and bewitching speeches; VjZt, That they must render to the Eternal Creator of all things, an adoration with more testimony and more extensive, than they had hitherto done, &c. This Hydra with an hundred heads, at that time misled, and continues to this day to mislead men, who are so weak as to submit to her empire; and it will subsist, until the moment that the true elected shall appear and destroy her entirely. The Degree of Sublime Elected, that you have passed, gives you the knowledge of those things which conducts you to the true and solid good. The grand circle represents the immensity of the Eternal Supreme, who, has neither beginning nor end. The triangle, or Delta, figured here is the mysterious figure of the Eternal. The three letters which you see signify as follows:—G, at the top of the mangle, “Grandeur of Masons”—the S. “submission to the same order” and the U, “Union,” that ought to reign among the Brethren; which all together make but one body, or equal figure in all its parts. This is the triangle called equilateral. The great letter G, placed in the center of the triangle, signifies, “Great Architect of the Universe,” who is God; and in this ineffable name is found all the divine attributes. This letter being placed in the center of the triangle, is for us to understand that every true Mason must have it profoundly in his heart. There is another triangle repeated, wherein is enclosed three letters of which you have had the explanation in the 6th degree. This triangle designs the connection of the Brethren in virtue. The solemn promise they have made to love each other; to help, succor, and keep inviolably secret their mysteries of the peifection proposed, in all their enterprises. It is said in that degree, that You have entered the third Heaven; that means that you have entered the place where pure truth resides, since she abandoned the earth to monsters who persecuted her. 302"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun ~.

The Knights of the East, the Princes of Jerusalem, and Knights of the East and West, are known to us, in our days, to be Masonry renewed, and all of them lead us to the same end of the celestial truth, which is to say finished. The Knights of the White and Black Eagle, and the Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret, and Grand Commander, are the Chiefs of the great enterprise of the order in general.” Then Father Adam says to the Candidate—”My dear son, what you have heard from the mouth of Truth, is an abridgment of all the consequences of all the degrees you have gone through, in order to come to the knowledge of the holy truth, contracted in your last engagements. Do you persist in your demand of coming to the holy Brother, and is that what you desire, with a clear heart, answer me?” The Candidate answers— ‘1 persist.” Then Father Adam says—”Brother Truth, as the truth persists, approach with him to the sanctuary, in order that he may take a solemn obligation, to follow our laws. principles, and morals, and to attach himself to us forever.” Then the Candidate falls on his knees and Father Adam takes his hands between his own, and the Candidate repeats the following obligation three times (viz~) 303"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":".-“ Knight Adept of the Eagle, or Sun v... §.

Amen. Amen. Amen. After the obligation, Father Adam raises the Candidate; and gives him one kiss on his forehead, being the seat of the soul.

A short time after the two Knights with the Candidate have heard the loud rap of the Grand Commander, to open the Chapter, they both take their hands, and after one of them has been at the door, and when they think the Grand Commander has finished the necessary business, they introduce the Candidate, and leave him in the hands of the Grand Commander, and all four retire to guard the door of the entrance, and evety other door of the adjacent rooms, (if any)— the reason of their leaving the Chapter is, that no person ever assisted at the reception of a Knight Templar When the Candidate enters the Chapter, he prostrates his face to the ground, when the Grand Commander, behind the curtain, reminds him of the principal points of Masoni’,, from its beginning, to the epoch of the assassination of Hiram Abiff Solomon’s desire of punishing the traitors, in the most exemplary manner; the method he took in disposing the Masters who went in search of the three villains in order to execute his vengeance. He repeats to him the zeal, constancy and feivency of Joabert, Stokin and Jubelum, who, after the most painful search, (by Solomon’s order) had the happiness of finding among the ruins of Enoch’s temple in the Ninth Arch, the precious treasure of the Perfect Masons. He continues to remind him of the firmness of the Grand Elect, and Perfect Masons, at the time of the temple’s destruction, when they passed through the enemy at all risks, till they obtained an entrance into the sacred vault, to find the pillar of beauty, that they might by effacing the ineffable word, hinder its being exposed to the profane. He then reminds him of the seventy-two years captivity, and the clemency of Cyrus, king of Persia, who, by the request of Zerubbabel, not only gave the Israelites their freedom, but ordered that all the treasure of the temple (taken by Nebuchadnezzar) should be restored to them, in order to decorate the new temple, which he ordered them to build to the infinite God, and at the same time created them Knights. Then he repeats the clemency of Darius to Zerubbabel (when at the head of the embassy from Jerusalem to Babylon) with their complaints against the Samaritans, who refused to contribute to the sacrifices of the new temple, according to the proclamation of his 322"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"K—H, Knight of White & Black Eagle ~‘. predecessor, Cyrus, in favor of the Knights of the East; when they received Darius’s letters to all the governors of Samana, &c., and how the ambassadors were received on their return to Jerusalem; and elected princes by the people. He then reminds him, that after this, the second temple being destroyed, how the Most zealous Masons united under chiefs, and worked to the reformation of manners, and elevated in their hearts some spiritual edifice, and rendered themselves worthy by their works. They were more particularly esteemed and distinguished in the time of Manchin, who was the most remarkable among them. A great many others embraced Christianity and communicated their secrets to those Christians, whom they found had the good qualities of it, living in common and forming themselves as one family, which shows how the brilliant order of Masons sustained themselves until the sixth age, and how it fell into a state of lethargy. Notwithstanding which, there have been always found some faithful Masons; which is clearly proved by the brilliant manner in which the order of Masonry was received in the year of 1118, when eleven Grand Elect and Perfect Masons, the most zealous, presented themselves to Garino us, prince of Jerusalem, Patriarch and Knight Mason, and pronounced their promises between his, hands. They taught him the succession of the time, and progress to the time that, the princes went to conquer the holy land.—The alliance and obligations that were formed between those princes, was, that they would spill the last drop of their bloocL in order to establish in Jerusalem, the worship of the Most High. He informs him that the peace which took place after these wars hindered them from accomplishing their design, and, therefore, have continued in theory what they had sworn to do practically, never admitting in their order only those who have given proofs of friendship, constancy and discretion. In fine, the Illustrious Grand Commander makes a general history in genealogy, of the Masonic order, its progress, its decline, and the manner how it was sustained, till the epoch of the crusades, and until the historical circumstances, that have given occasion to the degree which the Candidate expects; a degree that will give him a perfect knowledge of the precedent 323"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":".-“ K—H, Knight of White & Black Eagle v... degrees, and the manner how Masonry has come to us; after which, the Candidate takes the following obligation, his nght hand on the Bible, his left hand under the curtain between the hands of the Grand Commander. §.

It was not less so in its tragic end, when by the noble firmness of these Knights who appeared in the middle of irons frames and torments. What can we think of the prophecy of James DeMolay, and which was verified a little after—What respect ought we not to have for the courageous zeal of those who have kept the precious remains of an order which the blackest treason, envy, and the most atrocious malignity has not been able to extinguish? What hatred ought not we to have, to those usurpers who occupy the wealth and dignity of this order? They cannot be, regarded but only as a powerful enemy, the ashes of which ought to renew that unfortunate period, when the members of the Knights shall be increased, so that they shall be able, under the auspices and conduct of a Grand and Powerful Commander, to retake the possession of all the wealth and dignity which did belong to them formerly, and is now held by those who have no other title, this day, but injustice and malignity. This is not said, my dear Brother, to intimidate those who have, as well as yourself, aspired to this degree which we are going to confer on you this day, or to inspire them with an ardor or indiscreet zeal, for they ought every one to wait the time in silence, to become essential; and if the trust is the more authentic mark of sincere friendship, they ought to wish to augment the number of the Knights, and fear to confer this degree, with too much confidence, on an ordinary friend, lest his discretion should not be assured as your own.

He then reads the words at the bottom of the ladder, NEC PLUS ULTRA. Then the Grand Commander embraces the Candidate, and says to him—My dear Brother, I am going to give you the Sign, Token, and Word, with the Pass Word of the Grand Elected and Grand Inspectors, after I have given you the explanation of the mysterious ladder which you have ascended and passed over, without knowing the reason thereof. This ladder, my dear Brother, is the most essential and analogous to the history which I shall recite to you. Like a ladder it is composed of two supporters, which will give you ajust idea of the strength which Philip the Fair, king of France, had, in his union with Pope Clement the 6~. The reunion of the second supporters, by the seven steps, gives you a just idea of the seven conditions that Philip, the fair, imposed on the archbishop, Bertrand Got, to make him Pope, and the two supporters being united by the seven steps or conditions, are the base of the union between the King and this Pope elect. The seven steps are also a resemblance of the seven points of your obligation, which you have contracted, and in the same manner Philip the Fair, made Bertrand. Got take; that by the seventh article, he swore the final destruction of the Knights Templars: and in the same manner, of the seven points of your obligation, you swear to bear an implacable hatred to the Knights of Malta, and engage yourself to endeavor their total destruction, in order to reclaim the rights and dignities which they possess. Lastly, this moment, my dear Brother, is the time to instruct you in full, in the degree of Grand Elected, and which gives us a true knowledge how Masonry came to us. Attend to that painful history—you will easily make the application yourself the more you are instructed. 330"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":".“ K—H, Knight of White & Black Eagle i’.. §. History. After the death of Benedict the 11th, who died July 13th, 1304, the cardinals met for the election of a new Pope, and formed themselves in two factions, French and Italians. Philip the Fair, king of France, had then several views which could be accomplished without the assistance of the Pope, to be elected; and as his party in the conclave fomented these divisions to favor Philip’s design (who taking advantage of these circumstances) sent for Bertrand Got, then archbishop of Bordeaux (son of Bertrand, Lord of Villandran, in the same diocese) and in the conference which he had with him at a pleasant country seat, near St. John of Angely, when he informed him of his design, and the division of the conclave, which put it in his power to elect a Pope, and that he (Philip) was disposed to favor him, provided he would swear to perform seven articles, the seventh of which was, to be even a secret to him (the new Pope) until the time for the execution of it should be npe. Accordingly he revealed the six first articles which are foreign to our purpose, but the seventh, for the exact performance of which, they both took the sacrament to each other’s promise. The king having found a man to his purpose to be agent for his revenge, caused him to be elected Pope and promoted to St Peter’s chair. In the year 1305, under the name of Cement 6th, this Pope after his election established his see at the city of Lyons, where his first care was to execute the six first conditions which Philip had imposed on him. The time of declaring the seventh being arrived, Philip did not delay in declaring to the Pope, that by his oath he was to join him, to entirely destroy and exterminate the Knighis Templars. to the extent of Christianity. Here is what attracted the hatred of Philip the fair, and what made him take the barbarous resolution against them all. Some time before the death of Benoit the 11 th there was a sedition in Paris, occasioned by Philip, who had coined some money, which was light, mixed with base metal, on which the populace were mutinous, who plundered and demolished the house of Stephen Barbet, master of the mint. They went 331"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"~w K—H, Knight of White & Black Eagle ~. afterwards to the king’s dwelling, and committed a great deal of indecency, so that every matter conspired an insurrection. The Knights Templars (against whom envy had raised many powerful enemies) were suspected to have been at the bottom of these outrages, although without any foundation, and their ruin was determined by the king, for which purpose he sought the means of obtaining assistance, when the most favorable opportunity offered itself by the death of Benoit the 11 ~. In order to put in his stead a Pope, on certain conditions, that should be imposed on him. Nothing was now wanting but a pretense (for when force and authority are in hand, every matter becomes easy) for which purpose they prevailed on two abandoned men with money (whose names were Gerard LabE and Benoit Mehui). They proposed to them to get admission among the Knights Templars, and when admitted into their mysteries, to accuse the whole order of the greatest crimes, which these two villains executed exactly. They desired to be received into the order, which was an easy matter, as they had an honest exterior, titles, and apparent qualities, besides a supposed credit at court. Every one was in their favor, and they were received. But it was not long before the Templars repented heartily of having lighted the fire brand, which was the cause of the deplorable and tragic scene, in which most all of the Templars were involved in one common destruction; for those two wretches, soon after their admission, accused the whole order of the most dreadful and most execrable crimes, demanding to be separated from them, for the unheard of terrible things which were suggested. The treason is good but the traitor is detestable. Thus did they suffer the same lot that was intended for the Templars, for they by their treachery received the most dreadful torments, and were not suffered to live. They had been the instruments, or the cause of vengeance to the Templars, by their false accusations. Upon their reports, the King, (who had lately an interview with the Pope at Potier) took the surest measures to arrest all the Templars in his dominions in one day. This was done on the 13~ of October 1307, two years after the accusation of these two villains was made. They seized on all their papers, 332"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"-a.” K—H, Knight of White & Black Eagle ~. titles, and treasures, and most of their wealth, over which were placed overseers. King Charles of Naples, in like manner, ordered all the Templars in his province to be arrested. Those taken in France were locked up in the Castle of Mehun, to wait for their trials. The Pope, at the same time, sent for their Grand Master, James DeMolay, a native of Burgundy (who was then at war on the Island of Cyprus) who, as soon as he received the orders of the Pope, came to Paris with his Knights of the order, among which was one Guy, Brother of the dauphin, Devienois, Hughes DePerald~s, and Theodore Bazille DeMonancourt. They were all arrested and made to suffer the most dreadful torments, in order to draw from them a confession of the crimes they were accused of, though without effect, as they bore bravely every torment, rather than accuse themselves of things of which they were innocent. So that on no other proof than that of two infamous suborners, their trials were concluded (it being impossible to obtain the least evidence against them, as never any person assisted at the making of a Templar). They executed and burnt alive fifty-seven on one day; on the next fifty-nine, and so on, until they had completed almost their total destruction. They pardoned none, not even those that served them in accusing the whole order, for as Templars they were included in the general sentence and burnt alive with the others. Let the end of these unhappy wretches serve as a lesson to us, that we are not in future to be seduced by fine promises, and initiate any but those who have given us. by a long train of service, proofs of the most solid worthiness, lest we might by their indiscretion, be dragged again with all the Knights of Kadosh, or White and Black Eagle, in a common fate. The Grand Master and the three above mentioned Brethren, were nevertheless not comprehended in the first execution. The Pope (for reasons which no historian has mentioned) kept the judgment to himself. Most all of the Templars at the time of this prosecution, (which lasted till the year 1314) were arrested in all Christian states, but were not all put to death. 333"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"K—H, Knight of White & Black Eagle ~. Philip the Fair, was continually hurrying the Pope to make an end of James De Molay, the Grand Master of his companions (after having groaned nearly seven years in prison, overloaded with irons) which was at last executed, when they were burnt alive, the 11 th of March 1314, in the isle of Paris, which moved to pity and team, the numerous spectators who were present. They were steady, heroic, constant, and made the most solemn vows of their innocence, which was afterwards apparent, supported by an event extremely memorable. James De Molay, the Grand Master, seeing himself on the scaffold ready to end his life in the flames (after having lingered in irons for several years) and which was now a relief to him, to end his life in any manner rather than undergo a longer lingering in prison in this uncertain world, with great composure turned himself and directed to God the following prayer (vizt)~ “Oh, Almighty and Everlasting God, who knows the innocence of the victims, who have been sacrificed for several years, permit us to reflect on the reproach and infamous torments which you permitted Jesus Christ to be covered with at his death, to redeem us from the slavery of our sins, to give an example to the innocent, in teaching them, by his mildness to suffer without murmuring, the persecution and torments, which injustice and blindness prepare for them. Forgive, 0 God, the false accusations and imputations, which have caused the destruction of the whole order, of which your Divine Providence has established me chief; and if you are pleased to accept the prayer which we now humbly offer you, permit, 0 God, that one day these people may know the innocence of those who have endeavored to live in thy holy fear and love.—We wait your bounty and compassion the reward of the torments and death we suffer, which we offer to you in order to enjoy your divine presence in everlasting happiness.” Then addressing himself to the people, he said—”Good people, who see us ready to perish in the flames, you will be able to judge of our innocence, for I now summon Pope Clement the V in forty days, and Philip the Fair, in twelve 334"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"..-w K—H, Knight of White & Black Eagle p... months, to appear before the awful and tremendous throne of the ever living God, to render an account of the blood they have wickedly shed”—after which they were hurried to execution, fearing the rescue of the populace. The prediction of James de Molay was accomplished, as Pope Clement the V died the 19th of April, the same year, at Rocquemour on the Rhone, and Philip the Fair, within Twelve months at Fontainbleau. The news of the persecution of the Knights Templars, had already reached the Knights which were left in Cyprus, and in the absence of their Grand Master had been overpowered by the Turks, when they lost Acre, with several other places in that island, and were obliged to retire to the isle of Rhodes and the adjacent islands. The prosecutions against them in open council at Vienna, the 19 th of October 1311, when the order was banished, their estates confiscated and left at the Pope’s disposal, who in the year 1312, gave a part to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who at this day possess the greatest part of their estates. This adversion makes to this day, a part of the obligations of the Grand Elect and Knights Templars. As the number of them who escaped was very small, it rendered that adversion more powerful; they sought to increase their order by admitting persons in whom they believed, and thought worthy of keeping the most important secret. Such they found among the good and virtuous Masons, whom Solomon had distinguished and favored, after the construction of the temple. The candor and intrepidity which appeared among them in the greatest dangers; their wisdom, union, charity, love, impartiality, firmness, discretion and zeal, all led them to believe they could do no better than unite themselves to them. Their fathers, protectors, and supporters, sought the favor to be admitted into their society, and initiated into their mysteries. Those who were newly initiated into their mysteries were informed by the Masons, who they were, the barbarous events which they had escaped. and the resolution they had taken, secretly to increase their numbers, in order to reclaim their rights. to re-establish their order and take possession again of their estates. I 335"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"...“ K—H, Knight of White & Black Eagle v... The Templars offered their Brethren Masons their assistance, in taking their revenge, and as a common cause to accept the tribute from them, of the most just gratitude and thankfulness. The Grand Elected Knights, and Princes Masons approved their designs, accepted their offers, and agreed among themselves, instead of the character of their order, which was a cross, to use the Word, Sign and Token of Masons, and by the conformity of several analogies (events in their history) persuaded them that the different signs of Masons would put them entirely under cover, against the maliciousness of such as Gerard Labe, and Benoit Mehuy, should endeavor to be admitted into the order, and that they should not entrust the true secret to any but those whom they had tried, and of whom they had the utmost confidence. After having made them pass through the different degrees which we know in Masonry, the birth of which was take from the construction of Solomon’s temple, until its destruction; characterized by the most remarkable events, entirely analogous to the destruction of the Knights Templars, whom, as Elects of Masonry, crieth only to revenge the death of their Illustrious Grand Master and retake their possession.

That we may propose, consider and undertake one thing for the good of mankind in general, and this our honorable Order in particular, therefore, my dear Brethren and exalted Scottish Knights, arm yourselves with four towards the Scottish Chair, to enable this our assembly, strictly to consider with me every thing, that we may never resolve or undertake anything for which we should have cause to repent. Assist me in opening the Lodge. Q. What is the duty of the Grand Senior Warden in opening the Scottish Lodge? The Senior Warden rises and— A. To see that this Grand Lodge is perfectly secured and that it may sc remain. Then the High Exalted orders the grand Senior Warden to do his duty in every point, which he does by going Out and examining if all things is in perfect security. When he returns he stands behind the chair, with his sword drawn in his hand, and makes his report to the Grand Master. Then the Grand Master asks the Junior Grand Warden (who rises and draws his sword) Q. How many is the number of our exalted Scottish Lodge? A. Four. Q. How many makes four and three? A. Seven complete. Q. What is the reason that Masons are attached to the number seven? A. Because it is the most perfect number, as by it we make our calculations. Q. How does the wind blow’? 344"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew ~.. A. From the four quarters of the globe. Then the Grand Master addresses himself to the Grand Secretary, who rises and draws his sword. Q. Is every thing prepared and in readiness for the opening of the Grand Scottish Lodge? A. Yes, Most exalted Grand Master, every thing requisite for this Grand and Sublime business is in readiness. Q. What weather is it? A. A most glittering star light sky. Q. What is the clock? A. It is high midnight. Then the Grand Master says—My Grand Scottish Masters, exalted Knights and Brethren, I declare this Lodge to be opened and every Brother will conduct himself accordingly. Then the Grand Senior Warden says— Noble Knights and Brothers, let us not forget the duty we owe to out Most exalted Grand Master. The Knights all rise, drawing their swords and holding them in their left hands, taking off their hats with their right hands, they salute the Grand Master (all at one motion by taking it from the master of Ceremonies) by lowering the points of their swords, bowing their heads very low. They then put on their hats, sheathe their swords, and give the Common Scottish Sign, when each takes his seat. I 345"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew p... §. Reception. The Grand Master of Ceremonies goes out and orders the Candidate to be washed, his shoes taken off, and blindfolds him. He then gives four knocks on the door, which is opened by the Junior Grand Warden, who at the entering of the Candidate, throws a gold colored rope with four knots in it, round his neck. N.B.—The knots must be tied in such a manner that with one pull they may be easily loosened. And during the opening of the Lodge, the Candidate should lay on the ground or floor. After the Candidate has entered with the preceding ceremony, he is placed between J and B. Then the Most Exalted speaks as follows- - G.M.— My Brother, do you desire to become a Grand Scottish Master? Cand. — I do most cordially. G.M.—I must inform you that your desire is of a very high nature, are you perfect in the common Blue Master’s degrees? Cand. —Yes, I am. G.M. —Then give the Signs, Token and Words the Grand Senior Warden. Cand. —(He gives them.) G.M. —Dear Brother, since you have proved your knowledge and duties in the Blue Master’s degrees, to our satisfaction, I will now instruct you in the mysteries and duties of the Scottish Masters, provided you have confidence to go through the same. An Elder Scottish Master is a high Priestly Order, my Brother, and highly different from the Blue Master. A Master of the three lower degrees, wherein until now you was only taught to venerate the Godhead, under the name of the Most Great, Most Wise and Almighty Architect of the Universe—But an Elder Scottish Master must pay a more deep and feeling veneration to the Almighty God. That due veneration we are taught by the teacher and declarer of our Holy Order, when he says, “The true worshipers will worship him in spirit and in truth.” Farther he says, “And they shall be unto me my people, and I will be 346"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Grand Master Ecos6 / Knight of St. Andrew ~.. unto them their God.” The first veneration is common to all men and Brethren, as directed by common sense, but the latter belongs to those who dedicate their hearts for the dwelling of the Most High and Merciful God, the Grand Architect of the Unlverse. Will you, my Brother, adhere to your former loose mode of worship, or, are you resolved to begin your veneration in Spirit and Truth? and henceforward to be instructed and directed in the system, practiced by the Grand Scottish Masters? Cand. —Yes I will, most cordially. G.M.—Have you, during the time you were in the Blue Master’s degrees, duly and faithfully observed the following articles?— lSt.~Have you paid due veneration to the Most Wise and Mighty Architect of heave and Earth? Cand. —Yes, I always have. 2fldW.~Have you improved yourself by flying from vice and practicing virtue? Cand. —Yes, I have. G.M.—Did you study the industrious labors and the useful precepts of the wise? Cand. —I did most carefully. G.M. — Did you always live peaceably among the Masters, and did you ar all times defend their right from the rebellious craft? Cand. —I did to the utmost of my power. G.M. — Well, my dear Brother, I am happy to find you worthy of being received among the Elder Masters, but I must first ask, have you resolution and fortitude enough to go through the holy work of the Masters? For this work is more exalted, and greatly differs from the works, you have hitherto been used to. you have only used the Square and Compass for mathematical geometry, and for drafts for architects, but in the Scottish Masonry, the Square and Compass is differently employed, you have only used it on single and outward buildings, and made but an imperfect draft of the world. But by the Scottish work, you will bring forth the most shining and brilliant materials, sufficient for 347"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"..~ Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew drafting the world, complete. Will you most sacredly and solemnly swear and promise to keep the mysteries of the Scottish Masonry, which will be communicated to you, in everlasting silence, not directly or indirectly disclose or communicate them, or any pat thereof to the Brethren of the Blue Order, or to any in the world who is not entitled to it? Cand. —I do most willingly consent to all the preceding injunctions, and do most solemnly promise to observe them. Then the Grand Master orders the Junior Warden to lead the Candidate out of the Porch into the Outer Coufl of the Temple, from thence into the Sanctuary and then into the Sanctum Sanctorum, and from thence to conduct him to the three Go/den Basins. The Junior Warden leads him four times round the Lodge, and as often as the Candidate comes before the altar, the Grand Master from the chair gives the four Scottish knocks, and gives the Common Sign, which is repeated by the Brethren. Then the Grand Master says— 0! how great and glorious is the presence of the Almighty God, who gloriously shines from between the Cherubims’ After the second four knocks, he says— We adore the great and Mighty Jehovah, who exists from eternity; glorified be his great and mighty name for ever and ever. At the third four knocks, he says— How adorable and astonishing are the rays of that glorious Light, which sends forth its bright and brilliant beams from the Holy Ark of Alliance and Covenant At the fourth and four last knocks, he says—Let us, with the deepest veneration and duty adore the fountain of that glorious spirit which is the Most Merciful and Beneficent Ruler of the Universe and all the creatures it contains. After this the Candidate is led to the altar where he kneels on both knees and takes the following 348"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"~v Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew ~. §. Obligation. I — — of my own free will and accord, do most solemnly swear, in this most sacred and Holy Temple in the presence of the most brilliant and glorious rays, infused by the Most Puissant, Most Terrible, and Most merciful Almighty God and Grand Architect of the Universe, and before this right Worshipful exalted Chapter assembled of Grand Scottish Masters, and valiant Knights of St. Andrew, that I will always hail, for ever conceal and never will reveal, any part or parts of the mysteries of the Scottish Masonry which I am to receive now, or shall be instructed therein any time hereafter, to any of the Brethren of the Blue order of St. John’s Lodge, and still less to any profane, or to any person in the world beside. I do furthermore swear that I never will give this degree and order of Scottish Master and it mysteries to a Brother singly by myself, unless duly and properly authorized so to do, and the person to whom the same shall be given must be duly qualified for it, by having regularly and lawfully passed through all the preceding degrees of Sublime Masonry, and at least having served, regularly, as Master in the Chair, in a regular constituted Lodge of the order of St. Johns. All this I sincerely and solemnly promise with a steady resolution to keep, and in failure thereof, I invoke, that all the causes may be fastened on my soul that I may be an everlasting example of a cursed wretch to all mankind, in future ages. I promise to redouble my zeal a~d friendship towards my Brethren, more particularly towards my Brother Scottish Masters. That I will heartily and sincerely love them, that I will assist them with my Council, support them with my power, even if it should be attended with a probability of the loss of my property, honor or life, as far as lays in my power, and consistent with my own and families preservation. So God maintain me in Equity and Justice, to persevere in the same with steadfastness. Amen. Amen. Amen. After taking the obligation, the Candidate is camed back to the west, and is placed between the two Grand Wardens, when the High Exalted Grand Master addresses him as follows— I 349"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"..~ Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew p... G.M—My dear Brother, do you desire to see the Great and Glorious light of the Temple? Cand.—Yes, I am most desirous. Upon which, the Junior Warden unfolds the bandage from flis eyes, when he beholds the glory of Solomon’s Temple, particularly the rays of the blazing star, which is suspended over the head of the Grand Master. G.M. —Do you see, my dear Brother, the Glorious Light, which so brilliantly shines from between the Cherubims of the Ark of the Mercy Seat’? Cand.—I see with joy the most glorious light. Upon which the Grand Master advances to the Candidate, with his sword drawn in his hand. The Brethren also draw theirs. The Grand Master then says— My Brother, this [pointing his sword at him] and all the swords of the Scottish Knights shall deprive you of your life, in any part of the Globe, should you be so unconscionable a wretch, as to disclose or discover the least of the mysteries of the order of Scottish Knights, but I can assure you, as long as you continue constant and true to your promise and obligations, that all the valiant Knights. will protect you, and save you from impending dangers, even at the risk of their honor, property and lives. I give you joy in this exalted station, and the honorable degree you have arrived at. May the great Jehovah assist you to persevere in the solemn and sacred engagements into which you have entered, that you may be able to fulfill them in every point. After which, the new Brother is taught to make the four Scottish steps, vilt, from west to south, from thence to east, and then to north, and from thence to west again, which is afterwards fully explained in the draft. 350"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"..-“ Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew i’... The Grand Master of Ceremonies gives him the following Signs, Token and Words— §. Signs, Token & Words.

Sacred Word. —JEHOVAH, the Grand and Ineffable name of the Grand Architect of the Universe. A Knight of St. Andrew, to make himself known to another, takes his sword or dagger, in his left hand, in such a manner, as if he was going to give a back strike, crossing at the same time his right hand over it, in form of a St. Andrew’s cross, the fingers clinched, holding it upwards, as if he was holding a working tool. The first part of the Grand Scottish Sign alludes to the Priests in the temple, who always put their hands to their foreheads, their fingers and thumbs extended as is to keep off the rays, whenever they gave the Benediction. This ceremony is still used in the Synagogue. Then the Grand Master invests him with the Apron, and at the same time explains to him the mystery and meaning of the green color, viz!, that a Scottish Master in all his works and undertakings must put his trust in Almighty God, that only from him success can be hoped. He arms him with a naked sword, which he 351"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew ~‘- puts into his left hand, and a trowel in his nght, in such a position, that they form a St. Andrews cross, holding the sword, as if he was going to give a back stroke or thrust—signiiying by that signs that the Knight of St. Andrew having carried on the war against the Saracens, with their swords in their hands, they at the same time forwarded and protected the workmen, having the working tools in one hand, and the sword in the other. The Grand Master then girths the sword to his side, and he is placed between the two Grand Wardens while the Grand master gives him the explanation of the draft before him— It is well known to you, my dear Brother, that the Porch with its Courts. the Sanctuary and Sanctum Sanctorum, was open to the High Priest, who officiated in Solomon’s temple, and since you are now admitted a Grand Scottish Master and are of course in the highest orders, you have free access into the Porch, Out Courts and Sanctuary, and even into the Sanctum Sanctorum, as a Secret place for your works. You see also the whole before your eyes. Consider then the consecrated Out Court and the two pillars, but they are now shortened and broken. The signification thereof you shall know. Now behold the sanctuary and the Sanctum Sanctorum of Solomon’s Temple, in which was placed the Ark of Alliance and Covenant, wherein were the two tables, containing the Ten Commandments, and the Rod of Aaron, which had blossomed, laid on the outside before it. On each side of the Ark of Alliance (which was the Mercy Seat) stood a Cherubim, with their wings extending over iL Between these Cherubims the Godhead discovered himself to the High priest in a stream of fire, under a thick cloud, and delivered his oracles from thence. The Ark you see painted before you serves a Knight of SL Andrew, as an emblem to adore the Invisible and Eternal Jehovah, and at the same time signifies that a Knight of St. Andrew should have the Law of the Eternal God always deeply impressed in his heart, and never to contemplate, undertake, or do anything contrary to those laws and precepts. 352"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"a .—“ Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew i’... You must now, my dear Brother, as a Grand Scottish Master, under the Great and Holy name of Jehovah, adore the Godhead in sincerity and truth, and such adoration and spiritual veneration must surpass the common adoration of Adonal. The Brazing Sea and Flaming Star are emblems you meet here, but were not found in the Temple—but they are hieroglyphic emblems of the Scottish Works. The seven dots you see here, does not signify the sevenfold arrangements of our order, as it does in the lower degrees of the Blue Order of St. John—but they signify, physically, the seven different metals, and when you see the seven planets, besides other star marked, it signifies the other mineral matters, as well as the seven planets. From this you may conclude, that the secret knowledge of the Grand Scottish Master points to the mixing and changing of the different materials, and to enable you to understand the subject, you must be informed that, every thing in this world, is formed from three substances, which are intimately and substantially mixed together, and from which is derived the four elements. The three substantial elements are Salt, Sulfur and Spirit. The first causes firmness, the second the softness, and the third mixture, the spiritual and vaporous particles. From the remarks of the three mixtures is to be understood, the three Golden Basins. In the first is engraved M, in the second G, and in the third, nothing. These initial letters, in the two first Basins signify in the Hebrew language, the M for MELACI-I which signifies Salt, and G for GOPHRITH, which signifies sulfur; for the vaporous spirit, there is no letter to express it—therefore there is no letter in the third Basin. These three Basins, were found, in the time of the Crusades or Holy Wars, by four Elder Masters from Scotland, in the ruins of the Temple, in a square hollow corner stone, and in memory of those four Elder Masters from Scotland, all the Elder Masters are called Scottish Masters to this day. The aforesaid three substantial matters, by which you can facilitate the changing of metals, must be done, through the five points or rules of the Scottish Mastership. The first Master point shows us the Brazen Sea, wherein 353"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":".~ Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew ~. must be some sea water. Out of this water, the Scottish Masters extract the first matter which is Salt ~&, which must afterwards undergo a sevenfold preparation. This sevenfold preparation, by which we must understand the seven steps of Solomon’s Temple, and the Brazen Sea, the first point or rule of the Scottish Master, as an emblem. The second substantial matter, namely the must be out of the purest gold, to which must be added, some purified and mixed according to Art. This mixture must be put in a vessel in the shape of a ship, in which it must remain, like the Ark of Noah. 150 days, and then be brought into the first degree of damp heat, that it may not rot. This is the second point or rule of the Scottish Masters, therefore you must for the second time set your foot on the Ark of Noah. The third work consists in adding to the above materials, the ethereal spirit through the mother water of -& as well as the itself, which must be daily added. The utmost care must be taken not to add too much, or you will destroy its tenacity, nor too little, or you will prevent it. This third point or rule of the Scottish Masters, is emblematical of the building of the Tower of babel where confusion and destruction reigned from the improper and injudicious admixture of the materials, therefore my Brother, you must for the third time, put your foot on this Tower, as this is the third point and work of the Scottish Masters. Now follows a fourth work, which is represented by this Cubical Stone, which is equally square and fits on all sides. As soon as the work is completed by the addition of the foregoing materials, it must be placed in the degree of fire, wherein it must received that degree of strength, which may be judged necessary. Therefore you must, my Brother, for the fourth time put your foot thereon. Then follows the fifth and last work, which is discovered to us by the Flaming Star. After the work is brought to a proportional substance, it must be placed in the fourth and strongest degree of heat, wherein it must remain three times twenty-seven hours, until it is red hot, by which means it becomes a bright and shining Tincture, and becomes fit, to change the lighter metals. Since the Flaming Star shows us the fifth and last point of the Scottish Master, 354"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":".-“ Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew ~‘. so you must, my Brother, for the fifth and last time, put your foot on it, by which you complete the four Scottish Masters steps. These five different installments you have performed only in ceremony, but you should also go through these five master points and rules, practically—and with one part, one thousand parts exchanged and ennoble them. So you may truly say, that you are a thousand years old, which we can as yet, no otherwise communicate to you them by ceremony. This great and noble Art, has in the time of Solomon, and afterwards until the time of the Crusades, remained among the Brotherhood, and more particularly reigned in Jerusalem. After our enlightened and most respectable Grand Master Hiram Abiff was murdered, by three vicious and villainous Fellow Crafts, the Art was entirely forgotten. This unhappy event is represented by the two overthrown and broken pillars of which the posture of the bases and the columns is still erect, but part of the columns, capitals, chapiters and architrave are still missing, which gives us to understand, that, not only the foundation of the Divine Art, is already laid, but they have also been raised to a considerable height. but the true measure and proper height is still wanting. From all this, my Brother, you should draw the following observations. Whatever Art or work your inclination leads you to, if you want to be an expert Scottish working Master, you must be attentive to study, true physical knowledge, learn the principles and practice of chemistry, that you may be more expert and handy, in the use of the Square and the Compass. which you likewise see in the draft, and lastly you will perceive a sorrowful emblem of the tragical history of our respectable Grand Master Hiram Abiff at your entrance. The rope round your neck, which you wore for the honor and the immortal memory of our enlightened and noble Grand Master, but I will soon recompense and reward you, by decorating your neck with a more brilliant Jewel. You must further observe, the grave of our respectable Grand Master is in the Holy and Consecrated part of the Temple and in the secret parts of the Scottish Master, Knights of St. Andrew. Lastly, I must inform you that the Scottish Masters, in consequence of the great zeal and valor which they showed I 355"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew ~ during the Crusades, were associated with the Scottish Knights of St. Andrew. They were honored with the Thistle, and were created Knights of this most honorable and ancient order of Knighthood, with all its formalities, which honor of Knighthood I shall invest you with, as a reward for your valor, virtue, fervor and constancy. The newly initiated Brother kneels down on a perfect square D. The Grand Master draws his sword, in form of a St. Andrews cross over his back and says as follows— N.B.—Dunng the ceremony two naked swords in the form of a St. Andrew’s cross are held on his back. §.

N.B.—At every Knighthood he confers on him, the Grand Master strikes him with his sword on his forehead, in the form of a St. Andrew’s Cross, and all the Brethren stand round him with their swords drawn. The Grand Master raises him, and kisses him four times, after which he invests him with the Order and Jewel, and says— I decorate you, my dear Brother, with the order of Hope and Perfection. 356"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":".—“ Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew i’... Then follows the consecration. The Grand Master puts both his hands on the new created Knight’s head and says- - The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. Amen. N.B.—This benediction must be made in a solemn tone of voice, such is used in Synagogues on festivals by the Cohen or Priest descendants of Aaron. After which the new initiated Brother makes himself known to all the Knights by giving them the Signs, Token and Words. The Grand Orator then delivers the following §. Oration. To us, my Brethren, as Grand Scottish Masters, the whole Temple is open, and by our exertions the whole work therefore is completed. By this you see the great pre-eminence we have to the Masters of the Blue order of St. John’s lodge, to the Sanctuary or Middle part of the Temple. The three divisions of the Temple which you see here, vizt., the Out Court, the Sanctuary, and the Sanctum Sanctorum, signifies the three principles of our Holy Order, which directs to the knowledge of Morality, and teaches the practice of those virtues which should be pursued by mankind. Therefore the seven steps which lead up to the Outer Court of the temple, is the emblem of the sevenfold light, we are in need of, before we can arrive at the height of knowledge. Next to this we come to the Mosaic pavement which puts us in mind, that mankind are in their nature unpolished and imperfect and take to themselves so many different figures, as their disappointments, sorrow, and drive them from place to place. Over two pillars J and B, which signify strength and establishment, our shortened and disfigured, because they have lost their capitals by the death of our most respectable Grand Master Hiram Abiff. 357"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew ~‘- The table which is divided by three lines in the length, to learn and understand the signification thereof, we must begin at the right, where we find the Tower of Babel. It is well known to us that it was a foolish undertaking by men, who were ridiculously feaiful of the Almighty God. This serves to remind us, that we should never feel ourselves with too high and exalted notions of our own consequence but that we must, in all our undertakings and works, use the greatest foresight and consideration, at the same time, the very careful and circumspect that we do not act against the will and Holy Ordinances of the Great and Mighty Jehovah. that we may not, like inconsiderate people, meet in our works, our destruction and our graves. The beauty of our Order suffered also a severe shock by the tragical end of our respectable Grand master, Hiram Abiff, which is constantly remembered and lamented by every true Brother, who humbly pray to the Great and Mighty Jehovah to reestablish the order in honor and safety. Let us now turn to the left, where you perceive the shortened pillar B which leads us to the Ark of Noah. This signifies the wonderful escape, and the establishment of our Order, under a thousand dangers and difficulties, which is not unlike the memorable adventures, dangers and sufferings, of our Holy forefathers. The Cubic Stone, signifies the perfection of our Order, as the Cube is the most regular body, whose sides are equal. So is the structure of our Order, if you consider its regularity, unanimity and its sacred connections, which are like the regularity and perfection of the Cube. Father we see in the draft of the Temple, the most noble and elegant structure that we ever was raised, which the Almighty God, had himself ordered, and honored it in the most particular manner, with his glorious presence as a testimony of his favors, of which we have the representation in our assemblies. The Sun signifies the form and glory of the Temple, the fame whereof, was spread through all nations. 358"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"~‘ Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew i’... The Pillar Il, which signifies the establishment of our Order, has likewise suffered very much, but it is yet very large and still makes a very splendid appearance, it stands under the sun in a direct line, the most notable and complete of the heavenly bodies. Observe the middle road, the steps of which, lead is over the Mosaic pavement between the B, strength; and J, establishment, of the order to the Brazen Sea, where we must purify ourselves, and wash off all pollutions. The Flaming Star is the emblem of the Holy and Glorious SHECHINAL before we dare approach the seat of the most exalted wisdom. The Ark of Alliance, wherein the tables of the laws were formerly deposited, serve to remind us, that our heart, are now the depository thereof, and where the laws must be forever engraved. This holy wisdom remained among the Brethren of the Order, even in the most sorrowful periods. This we remark on the middle road, where, not the least track, diminution or darkness or any remembrance of those sorrows are to be seen. God loved the order and protected them openly, at the time, when every thing conspired to its destruction—he suffered it to fall, that he might raise it with greater glory. 359"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew ~.. §.

We desire moreover, most exalted Knight and Grand Master, that you may never leave off assisting us with your good councils and examples and provide for our future works, that we may be enabled readily to transmit to our successors, the true foundation of our labors, and the practice of our works that we may rejoice. The Junior Grand Warden speaks— The wonderful secrets, the Scottish Knights and Brothers have discovered, in clearing the ruins of the Temple at Jerusalem, makes it highly necessary for us to discover the true use thereof, and that we may always make a happy use thereof. The Knights and Masters of this exalted Scottish Lodge, request the most exalted Grand Master, that our labors and assiduity may be assisted with his great wisdom and foresight, that we may make further beneficial discoveries, and through wisdom, strength and beauty, never fail in our happy undertaking of hallowed Masonry.

We are all unanimously resolved 362"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Grand Master Ecos~ / Knight of St. Andrew i’.. to regulate ourselves, agreeable to his will. But now, my Brethren, we must remember our duty towards our high exalted Grand Master, by 4 times 4 with all Knighdy honors, due to his exalted station.

Charge. My dear Brother—The Saracens having taken possession of the Holy Land, those who were engaged in the Crusades not being able to repel them, agreed with Godfrey Dc Bouillon, the conductor and chief of the Crusaders, to veil the mysteries of religion under emblems by which they would be able to maintain the devotion of the soldier, and protect themselves from the incursion of- those who were their enemies, after the example of the scriptures, the style of which is figurative. Those zealous Brethren chose Solomon’s temple for their model. This building has strong allusions to the Christian church. Since that period they have been known by the name of Master Architect., and they have employed themselves in improving the law of that admirable Master. From hence it appears that the mysteries of the Craft are the mysteries of religion. Those Brethren were careful not to entrust this important secret to any whose discretion they had not proved. For this reason they invented different degrees to try those who entered among them, and only gave them symbolic secr~1.s, without explanation, to prevent treachery and to make themselves known only to each other. For this purpose it was resolved to use different signs, words. and tokens, in every degree. by which they would be secured against Cowans and Saracens. The different degrees were fixed first to the number of seven by the example of the Grand Architect of the universe, who built all things in six days and 374"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Sovereign, or Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret ~‘.. rested on the seventh. This is distinguished by the seven points of reception in the Master’s degree. Enoch employed six days to construct the arches, and on his seventh, having deposited the secret treasure in the lowest arch, was translated to the abodes of the blessed. Solomon employed six years in constructing his temple, and celebrated its dedication on the seventh, with all the solemnity worthy of the divinity himself. This sacred edifice we choose to make the basis of figurative Masonry. In the first degree are the three symbols to be applied. 1St.~The first day of the creation, which was only chaos, is figured by the Candidate’s coming out of the black chamber, neither naked nor clothed, deprived of light, which the Master gave him, and his suffering the painful trial at his reception and his obligation. The Candidate sees nothing before he is brought to light, and his powers of imagination relative to what he is to go through are suspended, which alludes to the figure of the creation of that vast, luminous body, confused among the other parts of creation, before it was extracted from the darkness and fixed by the Almighty FIaL 2’~Y.—The Candidate approaches the footstool of the Master, and there renounces all cowans; he promises to subdue his passions, by which means he is united in virtue, and by the regularity of his life, demonstrates what he proposes. This is figured to him by the steps that he takes in approadiing the altar; the symbolic meaning of which is the separation of the firmament from the earth and water on the second day of creation. 31dIY.The Master gave the Candidate his first Masonic light, explained the first figures, gave him the Sign, Word and Token which distinguishes a Mason, by means of which he is known by his Brethren on any occasion, and in the midst of all who are not Mason, from whom virtue has separated him. These are the three symbols of the first degree, which distinguish the Apprentice from the other degrees. The second degree has to figures applicable thereto, which, joined to the three first, makes five, which distinguishes the Fellow Craft. 4thlY.~The fourth day the Grand Architect produced fruits on the earth, which was separated from water, and figured by the reception of the Brother to I 375"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"....‘v Sovereign, or Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret ~. the second degree; that is, separated from the Apprentice, that he might learn the use of the Square, Level and Plumb, by which he renders himself able and works to improve his knowledge of the society, which is the fruits of his reception. 5thIY.The Grand Architect adorned his work on the fifth day, by filling the earth with animals, the waters with fish, and the air with birds, which is figurative of the Fellow Crafts employing themselves to polish and cut stones, by the beauty of the Shining Star. To the third degree are two symbols, which, joined to the five former, makes seven, which is the Master Mason’s. 6thIY. —In Master’s degree you were taught to pass from the Square to the Compass, which shows you are to pass from one virtue to another, until you have obtained the whole. The death of Hiram Abiff, at your reception, teaches you what you ought to do, what you have been, what you are, and where you will go; which is compared to the sixth day, when god created man from the dust, gave him life, put into him a soul, and prescribed laws for his government. 7tI3IY — We lead most Masons to these degrees, where they rest under the shade of the sprig of cassia, which the Master of Masters, who passed seven days in tranquillity, dedicated to divine use, until the world is dissolved. You were taught in the first and second degrees to labor by the example of the Masons, who built Solomon’s temple, in order to improve and raise in our hearts an edifice, proper to offer homage to the Grand Architect of the Universe, and of which we ought to be the living Temple, which ought to be only ornamented with virtue. We are taught to polish stones, which teaches is to correct our manners, to regulate ourselves by the Compass, to square our actions, which will conduct us to good works, which every virtuous man should seek. We have the two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, as symbols of virtue and prudence, which prove to us that man is made for society where he ought to display his virtues and be an ornament of humanity. The three pillars (which support the Temple) demonstrate that every Brother induced by virtue becomes, of need, a supporter of the Craft. 376"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Sovereign, or Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret ~‘.. In the Master’s degree is represented the assassination of Hiram by false Brethren. This ought to put us in mind of the fate of Adam; occasioned by perverseness in his disobeying his great and awful Creator.. The symbolic mystery of the death of Hiram Abiff represents to us that of. the Messiah; for the: three blows which were given to Hiram Abiff at the three gates of the Temple, allude to the three points of condemnation against Christ. at the High Priest Caiphas, Herod, and Pilate. It was from the last that he was led to that most violent and excruciating death. The said three blows with the Square, Gauge, and Gavel, are symbols of the blow on the cheek, the flagellation, and the crown of thorns. The Brethren assembled around the tomb of Hiram is a representation of the disciples lamenting the death of Christ on the cross. The Master’s word, which is said to be lost, since the death of Hiram Abiff, is the same that Christ pronounced on the cross, and which the Jews did not comprehend, ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI, “my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, have pity on and forgive my enenues”—instead of which words are substituted, M.B.N. (Mac-be-nac) which, in Arabian, signifies, “The son of the widow is dead.” The false Brethren represent Judas Iscariot, who sold Christ. The red color worn by the Grand Elect Perfect and Sublime Masons, calls to remembrance the blood of Christ. The sprig of cassia is the figure of the cross, because of this wood was the cross made. The captivity of the Grand Elect and Sublime Masons, shows us the persecution of the Christian religion under the Roman emperors. and its liberty under Constantine the Great. It also calls to our remembrance the persecution of the Templars, and the situation of Jacques DeMolay, who, lying in irons nearly seven years, at the end of which our worthy Grand Master was burnt alive with his four companions, on the 1 Ph of March, 1314, creating pity and tears in the people, who saw him die with firmness and heroic constancy, sealing his innocence with his blood. My dear Brother, in passing to the degree of Perfect Master, in which you shed tears at the tomb of Hiram Abiff. and in some other degrees, has not your 377"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Sovereign, or Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret ~- heart been led to revenge? Has not the crime of Jubelum Akirop been represented in the most hideous light? Would it be unjust to compare the conduct of Philip the Fair to his, and the infamous accusers of the Templars, to the two ruffians who were accomplices with Akirop? Do they not kindle in your heart an equal aversion? The different stages you have traveled, and the time you have taken in learning these historical events, no doubt, will lead you to make the proper applications; and by the degree of Master Elect and Kadosh, you are properly disposed to fulfill all your engagements, and to bear an implacable hatred to the Knights of Malta, and to avenge the death of Jacques De Molay. Your extensive acquaintance with symbolic Masonry, which you have attained by your discretion, leaves you nothing more to desire here. You see, my dear Brother, how, and by whom, Masonry has come to us. You are to endeavor by every just means to regain our rights, and to remember that we are joined by a society of men, whose courage, merit, and good conduct, hold out to us that rank that birth alone gave to our ancestors. You are now on the same level with them, Avoid every evil by carefully keeping your obligations, and carefully conceal from the vulgar what you are, and wait that happy moment when we all shall be re-united under the same Sovereign in the mansions of eternal bliss.

Tribunals of Grand Inspectors Inquisitors Commanders were established to try and pass Judgment on all Brethren of the high Degrees, for malefactions against the Order. Each Tribunal consisted of Five Brethren and hence this order was called the Order of the Five Brethren. While the Pope of Rome was holding his Inquisitional tribunals for the trial of Templars and Free Masons for pretended offenses, We point with pride to our Brethren who like James De Molay and his brave companions, and in later days of John Coustos and other Brethren and Knights, who with unparalleled constancy endured the most dreadful tortures and afflictions, rather than betray the cause of Truth, virtue and Religion. There were however many weak Brethren who possessed not such fortitude and magnanimity as the Brethren and Knights to whom we have alluded who to Escape bodily sufferings, confessed crimes of which neither they or the Order to which they belonged were Guilty; these were less worthy of blame than other Brethren, who in order to answer some times serving mercenary and selfish Ends, voluntarily violated their obligations and became Traitors to our Orders. Additional vows and more rigid rules were adopted after the Martyrdom of the Knights of the Temple and Tribunals were Established for the Trial of all Traitors and apostates, the remembrance of which We commemorate in this sacred part of Grade of the order of Kadosh. We possess the power to reestablish them in form when and if it should become necessary (which God forbid).

As this is the most solemn and important of all the degrees of the Royal and Military Art of Free Masonry it is necessary that the utmost precaution should be used, in the selection of persons for admission. It does not follow that because a Brother may have received the degree of Prince of the Royal Secret, he is then entitled to receive this. None must be admitted whose character is not irreproachable, and whose zeal, virtue, discretion, fidelity, and fortitude are not fully known and approved. Such a person must apply in the following form: To the Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, in Supreme Council of the 3311 Degree Most Puissant Brethren, Ardently attached to the Glorious enterprise established in the degrees of KM. and Prince of the Royal Secret—and being anxious to arrive at the summit of Masonic Knowledge, and to enjoy its privileges, I most humbly beg leave to offer myself as a Candidate for admission into your Illustrious and Puissant Council and your suffrages in my favour will ever by held in grateful remembrance.

The Candidate then knocks on the door of the Council chamber 5-3-1-2 on which the Most lllustnous Inspector says— “Most Puissant Sovereign, some person knocks at the door and disturbs the deliberations of the Council. The Most Puissant requests him to go and see who it is. He then goes and knocks 5-3-1-2, and when the door is opened, he demands— “Who is it that knocks and disturbs our deliberations.” The lllustnous Grand Master of Ceremonies answers—”It is a Knight of Kadosh and prince of the Royal Secret, who is sincerely attached to his order, his Country and his God, who feels for the sufferings of humanity in the death of the Master, and humbly solicits admittance into the Supreme Council, that, he may enjoy the privileges which hereunto belong.” The door is then shut, and the Most Illustrious Inspector General reports the answer in the same words to the Most Puissant Sovereign, who desires the Candidate to be admitted if he posses the necessary qualifications. The Illustrious Grand Master of Ceremonies then introduces the Candjdate, who must be dressed in black clothes, and without shoes, hat, apron, s~vitL his head inclining fo,wards and downwards, his arms crossed on his breast;, his fingers touching his shoulders, a black cord, round his neck, which is held by the Grand Master of Ceremonies in his left hand, and a fire brand in his right.— In this situation he is led round the Council, and when he passes in front of the Most Puissant Sovereign, he bows before the Sacred and Ineffable name of God, which blazes in the East while the Most Puissant Sovereign says to him— “Let us with the deepest veneration and piety, humbly adore the fountain of all good. that Glorious and Gracious Being, who with mercy and Beneficence governs the Universe, and all the works of his Creation.

He is then led round the 3rd time, and on approaching the East, he again bows before the great Name, and the Most Puissant Sovereign addresses him as follows:— Most Respectable Knight and Prince, Impressed with the solemn scene through which you are about to pass, in taking an obligation, which of all others is the Most Awful and important that men can subscribe to.

Some incense must be thrown on it, composed of Amber, Olibanum, and Mastick, each three parts; Storax, two parts, Labdanum and Benzoine each one part, mixed in a gross powder. This will make it smoke and yield a grateful perfume. The Cauldron must be half filled with Quicksilver, which has the appearance of melted lead, by cannot be made hot. After washing his hands in it, the Candidate is led to the Quadrangular Pedestal, at which he knees and takes the Obligation of an Inspector, during which the incense is kept burning, and every Member kneels, inclining his head downwards in humble adoration, with their right hands upon their hearts.

The Candidate then puts on his shoes, and takes his sear among the Inspectors. §. History. The Most Puissant Grand Sovereign, Grand Master Commander in Chief, Sovereign of Sovereigns of the degree of Prince of the Royal Secret, was our Illustrious Brother, Frederick the 21d King of Prussia. He established this degree, in connection with our Brother, his Serene Highness, Louis of Bourbon, Prince of the Blood Royal of France, and other Illustrious characters, who had received the degrees of K.H. and Prince of the Royal Secret. The degree of K.H. or Knight of Kadosh, is a most awful and important .degree. In it we have without restriction, solemnly obligated ourselves to destroy an order of men, for crimes committed many Centuries ago, without regard to the common principles of Humanity, or the Laws of the Country. And notwithstanding the utmost precaution, in the selection of Candidates, some unworthy persons may be received into that degree, who through a mistaken zeal for the order, or a religious enthusiasm for the literal observance of Obligations, might be induced to commit acts, which never were contemplated. The King on the first of May 5786, formed and established the 33~ Degree to give some elucidations of the K.H.— The King was conscious, that agreeably to the common course of human nature, he could not live many years; and he conceived and executed the glorious design if investing the Sovereign Masonic power which he held, as Sovereign Grand Commander of the order of Prince of the Royal Secret—in a Council of Grand Inspectors General—that they might, after his decease, regulate, agreeably to the Constitution and Statutes which he then formed, the government of the Craft in every degree, from the I 7~~ or Knights and West inclusive, leaving the control over the Symbolic Lodge; the Grand, ineffable and Sublime Lodge of Perfect Masons, and the Knights of the East or Sword, to the Grand Council of Princes of Jerusalem, whom he conceived to be justly entitled to that Honor and power.— 402"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Sovereign Grand Inspector General ~. This new Degree he called “Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, or Supreme Council of the 3 31ti• The Princes of Kadosh or K.H. are Deputy Grand Inspectors General, acting under special patents, granted for that purpose, but to this degree, the Sovereign power is committed. The Council when formed can take cognizance of every circumstance appertaining to Masonry, from the 17th Degree upwards. Grant patents to deputy Inspectors General, or warrants for Councils hear all appeals from Councils or Individuals, above the Grand Council of Princes of Jerusalem, &c &c as is more fully explained in the Constitution accompanying this degree. No Inspector General possesses any Individual power in a Country, where a Supreme Council of Inspectors is established, as a Majority of their Votes is necessary to give legality to any of their proceedings. — In consequence of the power with which the Inspectors of this degree are invested, it is necessary to limit their number. Therefore, a Council cannot consist of a greater number than Nine; at least five of whom must profess the Christian Religion. No business can be transacted or the Degree given, but when three are present, except on its first establishment, as pointed out in the Constitution. There must be one Council of this Degree in each nation or Kingdom of Europe, two in the United States of America. as remote from each other as possible, One in the British West India Islands and one in the French. None of the Inspectors can be possessed of the Manuscript of this Degree, but those two, who first formed each Council. When an Inspector goes to another Country to establish this degree. it shall then be given to him, under an Obligation, never to give it, except in the like manner.

They entertained Christian strangers and pilgrims charitably, and in their armor led them through the Holy Land, to view the sacred monuments of Christianity. without fear of the Infidels. This Order continued to increase in numbers, power and wealth, and in about 200 years, was spread over all Europe.— The principal part of their Commandenes were along the Mediterranean Sea. As their influence was extensive, and their possessions great, Philip the Fair, King of France became jealous of them, which soon was increased into hatred, because they espoused the cause of Boniface 8 th in that Pontiff’s difference with King Philip, an insult which the King had never forgiven.— On the I3~ of October, Anno Lucis 5307 he arrested all the Knights Templars he could find in his kingdom, and brought them to the Stake. In the year 5312, the whole order was suppressed by Pope Clemens Quintus. And at the request of the King of France and the Pope, the Kings of England, Castile, Arragon and Sicily, the Count of Provence, and all the sovereigns in Europe, arrested the Knights Templars, seized their possessions, and placed Garrisons into their Commanderies, On the first of October of the same year, the Council of Vienna banished their whole order, in with the Pope, and gave the greatest part of their possessions to the Knights Hospitallers of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Knights of Rhodes, now called Knights of Malta, who were established about the year of Masonry 5120 when Honorius was Pope. The Knights of Kadosh or K.H. were originally called Knights Templars, but after the Massacre, by King Philip, the few who escaped, found it necessary, to change the title and appearance of their order, that they might the better avoid the persecution of their enemies. They then laid aside the Black order and red cross, and substituted in its place—a broad fiery blood colored 404"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Sovereign Grand Inspector General i’.. riband from the left shoulder to the right hip, to which is suspended a Black spread Eagle with 2 heads, with a naked sword in its Claws—. About the year of Masonry 5767 an Inquiry was instituted at Paris, to prove that those Masons who styled themselves Knights of Kadosh, were in reality Knights Templar. Had the Inquiry succeeded, the whole order, probably would a second time, have been cut off. In consequence of this circumstance It was determined, in the Grand Communications of Berlin and Paris, that they should, in future, be styled, “Knights of the White and Black Eagle.” The Knights of Malta, that they may retain th& possessions which they have unlawfully received, are solemnly obligated to exterminate the order of Knights Templars, who are actually they, who have received the degree of K.H. For this reason the Knights of Kadosh, or of the White and Black Eagle, have solemnly pledged to each other, their sacred honor9, and have sworn in the name, and in the presence of God, to hold them in enmity, and to exterminate them, whenever it is in their power.— Although it is a duty we owe to ourselves, to endeavor to destroy that power, which attempts to destroy us—yet it is necessary that the extent of our enmity and hostilities to the Knights of Malta, should be well defined lest we should expose ourselves to ridicule and contempt if not to punishment by the civil Law, it is not intended, that if a Knight of K.H. should go up the Mediterranean on business, and accidentally meet with some of the Knights of that Order, that he should immediately draw the poniard, and stab them to the heart. This would be deemed murder by the Laws of every Country, and would justly be punished with Death. But if any Sovereign power should declare war, against the Knights of Malta, or against any power with whom they have treaties of Offense, and they are actually in the field, then we are bound, by the solemn and awful obligations which we have taken, if the situation of our affairs will admit, of it to join immediately the Army of their Enemies, and to use our utmost exertions both in the Cabinet and the field, to exterminate their order, that we may once more obtain those possessions, which are the indisputable right of the Knights Templars. — I 405"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"~.“ Sovereign Grand Inspector General ~..

Convince them of the Villainy of their Conduct, by the uprightness of yours, and of their Injustice, by your mercy.

S—Why does it appear in our council? 1.—As our Order and authority are founded on Justice and Equity, we fear not the searching eye of the Supreme Being, and it is likewise to remind us that we are acting in his immediate presence.— It also teaches us, to look up to that source for protection and support, and to worship the only true and living God.

He knew according to the common course of human events that his dissolution was not very distant, and he determined to establish a Supreme Executive Council of Grand Inspectors General, to whom he might commit the great Masonic power which he possessed, and who, after his decease, might rule the great body of Masons, agreeably to certain Statutes which he framed for that purpose. that when they should become sufficiently strong, to lead them to battle against our enemies. He justly conceived that as every nation is Independent in their Civil government, it was most equitable, they should each possess, a high Masonic Court, from which there could be no appeal. As this would be agreeable to every Government, no jealousies could exist against the order; the Craft would increase, and the great end of the Institution be obtained.

S.—What is the reason of the Skeleton’s holding the Standard of the Order in his hand? 1.—To indicate the punishment of death which all those will receive who are traitors to the order and who forfeit the Obligations they have taken.
