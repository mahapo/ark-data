It was the result of the need ex - pressed by many grand commanderies, for a uniform system 01 drill, in consonance with our uniform ritual; also to af - lord an authorita Live method for the organization of Grand Encampment and Grand Commandery formations; and final - ly to allay the constantly recurring uncertainty and friction arising in our triennial competitive drills, by reason of n~any different systems of tactics. While claiming very little originality, your committee has carefully studied the drill tactics of every grand juris - (I) diction, as well as the tactics and drill regulations of the United States Army from 1865, and have included in this compilation that which seems most applicable to the pur - poses, circumstances and traditions of Templardom. Har - mony with our Ritual, and an intelligent co-ordination of the movements and nomenclature of the army drill, with the terms used by Knights Templar, has been our constant aim. Realizing that Templar drill is never a preparation for war, the older ‘form of Upton’s close order drill, has been preferred to the more modern U. S. infantry drill regula - tions, in which special emphasis is placed on training for 7 ‘1"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"-F- K - — ~‘NI ICI iii IIMIIVMUM. ii’ W~wiiI Ich ( i vga rglis.n I ww~Nt iehti rigargus. ni ~vw 5 NtiCI1tingargus.:1I ww.stichti ngargus. iii ~vw.stichtingargus.n I NW.Stichtiflgargus.n I xw.stichti ngargus.nt NW. stichtingargus .nI uw.sticbtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni vw. stichfingargus.nl vw.sticht ingargus.nl vw.stichi ingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.sfichtingargus.nl vw.sfichtingargus.nl vw. sfichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl I rw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. xl ichtingargus.nl wad ichtingargus.nl wiiI ichtingargus.nl w tdichtingargus.nl 8 INTRODUCTION combat. However, the infantry drill regulations has been taken as the model in form and arrangement, and wherever possible its exact Language and movem~nt has been followed. Acknowledgment is also made for many ideas and sug - gestions, gathered from various sources, and especially from the following books of tactics: Manual of Knights Templar Ceremonies of the Grand Encampment. Knights Templar Drill Regulations, Califotnia. Templar Drill Regulations, Indiana. Iowg Knights Templar Tactics. Manual for Tactics and Drill, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. / Michigan Knights Templar Tactics. Templar Tactics, Missouri. - Templar Drill and Tactics, New York. • Templar Tactics and Drill, Pennsylvania. 1(nights Templar Drill Regulations, Texas. Templar Tactics and M~mua1, Chilcott of Maine. Knights Templar Tactics, South Dakota. Knights Templar Tactics, Purinton. Manual and Tactics, Grant. Tactics and Monitor, Sumner. Infantry Drill Regulations, U. S. A. The mechanical drawings were executed by Sir Knight II. Gearing of Los Angeles Commandery No. 9, with sugges - tions from General Wankowski, p. ~. C., and the assistance of the members of that Commandery. Besides affording the fundamenthis of close order drill, an attempt has been made to incorporate the n~cesi~ary fea - tures of display and ceremony, characteristic of Templatisffl; also while the text is written for the average small corn - mandery, careful provision has been made for its easy adap - tation to larger bodies and commanderies and to the forma - tions and ceremonies of grand commanderies; and while not containing movements exclusively used in the asylum cere - monies, frequent reference has been made thereto, and care taken, to avoid conflict therewith. The preliminary report of the committee in the form 0 DEFINITIONS 9 “Provisional Drill Regulations” was widely distributed in all the Grand Jurisdictions, and recommended by the Grand Mas - ter for trial that its strength and weakness might thereby be proven. Three editions amounting to about five thousand copies were sold at cost of publication, and numerous changes and modifications made as a result of criticisms and sugges - tions received. At the triennial conclave at Seattle July 30, 1925, the report was adopted and the committee continued with instructions to make a final revision and publish the work with suitable illustrations, under control of the Grand Encampment, for the use of the Grand Encampment and aLL of its constituent and subordinate bodies. Copyright has been secured in the title of the Grand Encampment, and thc hook is accordingly herewith presented under the authoriza - tion of the Grand Master. No drill book was ever perfect, or satisfactory to all users, but it is believed this will furnish a basis Cor harmonious action and further improvement. To this end correspondence is invited from every source and ex - planations promised to all inquiries to the full ability of the committee. Address all commun’ications to the committee. P.

A. careful preliminary study of general principles should always be made by officers and junior officers, before attempting drill or instruction. The Eminent Commander is the commanding officer and is responsible for the proper training of the commandery. 2. It is not expected, however, that the Eminent Com - mander will actually be in command of every activity of the commander~, at all times. If he does not wish to assume the command, he xviii direct the Generalissimo, Captain General, or other competent Sir Knight, to act as the military officer, under the title of “Commander,” the subordinate in such case to remember that he is always under the command and direc - tion of the Eminent Commander. In accordance with templar tradition and custom, this officer will often, perhaps gener - ally, be the Captain General. In large commanderies there is no objection to )he appointment also of an Adjutant or Executive Officer, ‘ Chief of Staff.” These appointments are generally permanent, but may be emergent, and are always at the pleasure and discretion of the Eminent Commander. 3. Drills executed at attention and the ceremonies are designed to teach precise and knightly movement, and to in - culcate that prompt obedience which is essential to proper knightly control. To this end, smartness and precision should b3> exacted in the execution of every detail. Such drills should be frequent, but short. 4. The formations, movements, honors and ceremonies of these drill regulations are made to conform to the infantry drill of the United States army, of present and earlier stan - dard, as nearly as possible, consistent with the purpose, tradition, uniform and arms of Templarism. 5 To harmonize Knights Templar official titles with military terms, the following rules will be observed; it being understood, that for drill and instruction, the commanding officer may always make substitute appointments, required for efficiency, which appointments shall not affect the tem - plar rank of any officer. 13 / 5."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"F ~‘ufIchtInMIrguN.nI ~‘mt icIdi iigurgux.nt A~w NtichIiagargLts.flI ww,stlehti ugargus. ol ww,stichtingargus.nI ww,st ichti ngargus.

The Eminent Commander, referred to as “Coin - mander,” will command, and the Generalissimo and Captain General will be second and third in command. When, there - fore, the conimandery is formed as a single unit (company) they will simulate respectively the positions of captain, first lieutenant and second lieutenant (officers), the remaining of - ficers of the commandery, classified as junior officers (non - commissioned officers), in order of rank, will correspond to the sergeants of a military company. 7. When the Commandery is formed as a battalion the constructive rank of the Commander will be that of major; if as a regiment, that of colonel, with corresponding increase in the rank of his subordinates. 8. Grand Encampment and Grand Commandery officers will respectively simulate the grades above commandery of - ficers, as indicated in the U. S. tables of organization, for the battalion, regiment or higher unit. The duties of officers and staffs will conform as nearly as may be with the same tables. The title of the commanding officer of a Templar brigade wilt be “Brigade Commander”; and of larger bqdies “Marshal” or “Grand Marshal” instead of “General.” 9. While in these regulations Templar rather than mili - tary terms are used, no objection is seen to the employment of military titles for drill officers, especially of the higher units, as is now the practice in some jurisdictions, providing such course shall be approved by the grand commandery. Since we have so few mounted commanderies, no provis - ion has been made for such drill, those interested being re - ferred to the U. S. cavalry drill regulations. 10. The ranking officer of the Commandery, Grand Commandery or Grand Encampment may detail or relieve act - ing officers or junior officers, and form or discharge any re - quired staff, whenever he deems it expedient or necessary, for drill formations, but the assumption of military authority by such officers shall not confer or deny Temular rank. Past Commanders are designated as officers. Guides of threes or sections (corporals) are usually designated from the number of well drilled Knights. Acting junior officers may be simi - larly designated. GENERAL RULES FOR DRILLS AND FORMATIONS I Oa. Since Knights Templar drill is never professionaJ, and as a means of simplicity, and an assistance to prepara - tion and judging in contests, these Regulations in general provide but one way for the execution of each movement. While great latitude is permitted in the, instruction and ma - neuver of individual commanderies, in all competitions and in ceremonies, the text must be strictly followed, expedients being permissible only in cases not covered by the text, and in~ competitions subject always to the interpretation of the judges. General Rules will always be followed unless other - wise provided, and in any variation between description and illustration the description will govern. II. Formations are based upon a front of three Knights as a unit. All movements are described for single rank, but unless otherwise specified, the same orders and movements may be applied to double rank, at the option of the commanding officer, by such commands and means as he may devise. NOTE—Double rank for templar formations is discour - aged for the following reasons-: By tradition Knights Tem - plars were always mounted, and cavalry or dragoons are never formed in double rank, mounted or on foot; with the close elbow touch prescribed by these regulations, the dis - tance—ten inches—between the front and rear rank, would practically prevent the execution of the sword manual by the rear rank; the drifting sidewise movement of the rear rank necessary in the wheelings, is awkward and unsightly, and the formation is wholly unsuited to the asylum ceremonies. If space is limited it is always preferable to form subdivisions separately, and close in mass,- as the need for congestion may require. See Formation of the Commandory, Par. 189. 12. When the preparatory command consists of more than one part, its elements are arranged as follows: 15 -9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"F ~v,ut Ivhti ngurgux.

Movements that may be executed toward either flank are explained as toward but one flank, it being neces - sary to substitute the word “left” for “right,” and to reverse, to have the explanation of the corresponding movement toward the other flank. The commands are given for the execution of movements toward either flank. The substitute word of the command is placed within parentheses. 14. Any movement may be executed either from the halt or when marching, unless otherwise prescribed. If at a halt, the command for movements involving marching need not be prefaced by FORWARD, as 1. Column right (left), 2. MARCH. 15. Any movement not specially excepted may be eVe - cuted in double time. If at a halt, or if marching in quick time, the command Double Time precedes the command of execution. - 16. In successive movements executed in double time the leading or base unit marches in quick time when not otherwise prescribed; the other units march in double time to their places in the formation ordered and then conform to the gait of the leading or base unit. If marching in double time, the command Double Time is omitted. The leading or base unit marches in quick time; the other units continue at double time to their places in the formation ordered and then conform to the gait of the lead - ing or base unit. 17. To hasten the execution of a movement begun in quick time, the command: 1. Double time, 2. MARCH, is given. The leading or base unit continues to march in quick time, or remains at halt if already halted; the other units 4, GENERAL RULES complef4 the execution of the movement in double time and then conform to the gait of the leading or base unit. 18. To stay the execution of a movement when march - ing, for the correction of errors, the command: 1. hi plaie, 2. HALT, is given. All halt and stand fast, without changing the position. To resume the movement the command: 1. Resume, 2. MARCH, is given- 19. To revoke a preparatory command, or, being at a halt, to begin anew a movement improperly begun, the com - mand AS YOU WERE, is given, at which the movement ceases and the former position is resumed. 20. Unless otherwise announced, the guide of a platoon or larger subdivision of a commandery, or of a commandery in line, is right; of a commandery in line of subdivisions, center; of a rank in column of threes or sections, toward the side of the guide of the commandery. To march with guide other than as prescribed above, or to change the guide: Guide right (left or center). In successive formations into line, the guide is toward the point of rest; in platoons or larger subdivisions it is so announced. The announcement of the guide, when given in connec - tion with a movement, follows the command of execution ~or that movement; as, 1. Forward, 2. MARCH, 8. Guide right (left), unless otherwise specified. 21. The wheel on the fixed pivot by subdivisions is used in all formations from line into column and the reverse. The wheel on the moving pivot is used by subdivisions of a column in executing changes of direction. The moving pivot will describe a circle the radius of which is 80 inches; the step of about nine inches required in column of threes will be reduced proportionately as the front of-the subdivision is increased, the radius being always the same. 22. Partial changes of direction may be executed: by interpolating in the preparatory command the word half as"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"F A~’~v ‘lIiChtiUgOVgUN.UI WW,NLiChti ngal’gLIS.fl I ww,Nt lebti ngargus. iii ww,NtIChtg ngargus.n I ww.stichtingargus.nl NW.Stichtiflgargus.lII vw.silchtingargus.nt ATw.stichhngargus.nI NW. stichtingargus.nl MW. stichtingargus.nl wv~’.stichtingargus.n1 vxv.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus. ni VW.stLchtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl v~v.sti chtingargus.nl v~v.sti chtingargus.nl vxv. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 1W.Stichtrngargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W.Stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl rxv.stichtingargus.njl xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w .stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl WHI ichtingargus.nl W441 chtingargus.nl W Wichlingargus.nl 18 FORMATIONS AND DRILLS column half right (left) or right (left) half turn, a change of 45 degrees ,I a executed. By the command: Incline to the right (left), the guide, or guiding oIen~nt, moves in the indicated direction and the remthicler of the command conforms. This movement effects alight changes of direction. in changing direction the leading subdivision executes the turn, or wheel, at the command MARCH, the guide tak - lug his position when the change is made. 23. Full distance in colunin of subdivisions is such that in forming line to the right or left the subdivisions will have their proper intervals. In column of subdivisions the guide of the leading sub - division is charged with the step and direction; the guides in rear preserve the trace, step and distance. 24. All details, detachments, and other bodies of Knights are habitually formed in single rank. 25. The designation line of sections, line of platoons, companies, etc., refer to the formations in which sections, platoons, companies, etc., each in colunm are in line. 26. The posts of officers, junior officers, color guard, staff, etc., in the various formations, of the platoon, com - mandery, battalion or regiment, will be described and shown in plates. In all changes from one formation to another involving a change of post on the part of any of these, unless otherwise specified, posts are promptly taken by the most convenient route as soon as practicable after the command of execution for the moven~ent; officers who have prescribed duties in connection with the movement ordered, take their new posts when such duties are completed. 27. As instructors, officers and junior officers go wher - ever their presence is necessary. As file closers it is their duty to rectify mistakes and insure steadiness and prompt - ness in the ranks. In ceremonies officers, junior officers and special units must take their prescribed positions. 28. Brigade, regimental, battalion and staff officers GENERAL RULES may be mounted. The staff of an officer forms in single rank three paces in rear of him, the right of the rank ex - tending one pace to the right of a point directly in rear of him. Members of the staff are arranged in order of rank from right to left; the staffs in the same order according to the rank of their respective commanders. The orderlies, if present, are three paces in rear of the staff. When necessary to reduce the front of the staff and orderlies, each line ese - cutes threes right, according to the principles of the U. S. cavalry drill regulations, and follows the Commander. 29. A junior, mounted, addressing a superior officer on foot, will first dismount. Members of the staff, and orderlies, mount and dismount with their chief. 30. In making the about, an officer, mounted, habit - ually turns to the left. 31. When the Commander faces to give commands, the staff and orderlies do not change position. 32. When making or receiving official reports all offi - cers will salute. Where the word “Sir” is used by an officer in making a report, as “Sir, the parade is formed,” the proper honorary title of the officer to whom reporting, may be prefixed, as “Eminent Sir,” “Right Eminent Sir,” etc. Knightly courtesy requires the junior to salute first, but when the salute is introductory to a report made at a cere - mony or formation, to the representative of a common super - ior, as the adjutant, or other staff officer, etc., the officer making the report, whatever his rank, will salute first; the officer to whomh the report is made will acknowledge by sa - ulting that he has received and understood the report. 33. For ceremonies, such regimental and battalion jun - ior officers as are dismounted, are formed five paces in rear of the color or standard, in order of rank from right to left. In column of threes or sections they march as file closers. Oth~r than for ceremonies, staff junior officers, and orderlies accompany their iwpwcli~te chiefs unless otherwise"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"I----- - ~‘.fI ILtI I n~argL,u. ft ~DtNIiVh( I ilgorguHal ww,NLkhti ngargusad A’w,N( lebti ngargus. ii I AIW,HtiChti ngargus’.n I vw,stichtingargus.nI NW.stichtingargusnl NW. stichtingargus. ni ~w.stichtingargus.nI A’W.stichtingargus.nl vxv.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni vw. stichtingargus. ni vxv.stichtingargus.nl’ VW.stichtingargus.nI vxv.sticht I ngargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nI vw. stichtingargus.nl vxv.stichtingargus.nI vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtiflgargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nI rw.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rW.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichti ngargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.xI ichtingargus.nl wail ichtingargus.nl wait cliii ngargus.nl iv tdichlingargus.nl 20 ORJ)iiRS AND COMMANDS directed. If mounted, the junior officers are ordinarily posted on the right or at the head of the orderlies. In all formations and movements a junior officer com - manding a platbon carries his sword and takes the same post as an olficer in like situation. • ORDERS, COMMANDS, AND SIGNALS 34. Officers and Knights fix their attention at the first word of command, the first note of the bugle, or the first motion of the signal. A signal includes both the preparatory command and the command of execution; the movement com - mences as soon as the signal is understood, unless otherwise prescribed. 35. Commanders or leaders of subdivisions repeat or - ders, commMds, or signals whenever such repetition is deemed necessary to insure prompt and correct execution. 36. Prescribed signals are limited to such as are essen - tial as a substitute for the voice under conditions which render the voice inadequate. 37. Tn these regulations an order embraces instructions or directions given orally or in writing in terms suited to the particular occasion and not prescribed hejein. Orders are employed only when the, commands pre - scribed herein do not sufficiently indicate the will of the Commander. 38. Tn these regulations a command is the will of the Commander expressed in the phraseology prescribed herein. 39. There are two kinds of commands. The PREPARATORY command, such as Forward, indi - cates the movement that is to be executed. The command of EXECUTION, such as MARCH, HALT, or SWORDS, causes the execution. Preparatory commands are distinguished by small black letters, those of execution by BLACK CAPITALS. ORDERS, COMMANDS AND SIGNALS 21 Where it is not mentioned in the text who gives the commands prescribed, they are to be given by the Command - er of the unit concerned. The preparatory command should be given at such an interval of time before the command of execution as to ad - mit of being properly understood; the command of execution should be given at the instant the movement is to commence. The tone of command is animated, distinct, and of loud - ness proportioned to the number of men for whom it is in - tended. Each preparatory command is enunciated distinctly, with a rising inflection at the end, and in such manner that the command of execution may be more energetic. The command of execution is firm in tone and brief. Oral commands are not habitually used for units larger than a battalion. 40. When giving commands to Knights, it is usually best to face toward them. Indifference in giving commands must be avoided, as it leads to laxity in execution. Commands should be given with spirit at all times. To secure uniformity, all officers should practice giving commands. 41. An officer should always have his sword drawn when giving a command, to Knights under arms. Bugle Signals with Bugle Signals are only used for ceremonies, and large bodies for street parades and marches. (See Bugle Signdls and Calls, Par. 461.) Whistle Signals 43. Attention to Orders. A short blast of the whistle. This signal is used on parades and marches when necessary to fix the attention of troops, or of their Commanders, or leaders, preparatory to giving commands, orders or signals. Arm Signals ing 44. The following arm signals are prescribed. In mak - signals either arm may be used."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"- - ‘r—-- - - - - - - - -~----~——,J- ——-—- - -- —. - ---— ———---— —~ .- -- - ~.ufLtIIngtrguu.nt WWNtieh( iflgar$tIH.flI ww~NtIehLiflgat’gLis.flI A’W 1 NLIChLI ngargus~n I ww.stichti ngargus. n I wwmitichtingargus.nI APw.Stichtingargus. n I NW. stichtingargus.nl AKW.stichtingargus.nl wxv.stichtingargus.nl Mw. stichtingargus.nl vxv. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni vxv. stichtingargus.nl vxv.stichi ingargus.nl vxv.stichtingargus.nI vw.sticht ingargus.nl vxv.sti chtingargus.nl vxv. stichtingargus.nl vxv.stichtingargus.nl vxv.stichtingargus.nI vw. stichtingargus.nI 1W.Stichtingargus.nl 1W.Stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingatgus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl xvstichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl wssichtingargus.nl wad ichtingargus.nl wtii ichtingargus.nl iv ~1ichtingargus.nI 22 SIGNALS In making arm signals, the sword may be held in the hand.

SCHOOL OF THE KNIGHT AND SQUAD THE KNIGHT 45. Provision should be made for the proper instruction of newly created Knights in essentials of facings, marching, wheeling and sword manual to prevent their falling into awk - ward or bad habits, as well as to give grace and ease of move - ment. To this end the following exercises are prepared: Individual Drill, Without Swords 46. The drill should always commence promptly at the appointed time. Punctuality, silence in ranks, and close attention during drill must always be insisted upon. The instructor explains briefly each movement, first ex - ecuting it himself if practicable. He requires the Knights to take the proper positions unassisted and does not touch them for the purpose of correcting them, except when they are un - SCHOOL OF THE KNIGHT able to correct themselves. He avoids keeping them too long at the same movement, although each should be understood before passing to another. He exacts by degrees the desired precision and uniformity. Drills should be in fatigue uniform when possible and the sword manual not taught until the Knights have acquired some proficiency in the school of the Knight. 47. For preliminary instruction a number of Knights, usually not exceeding three or four, are formed as a squad in single rank facing to the front. Position of the Knight, or Attention 48. Heels on the same line and as near each other as the conformation of the Knight permits. Feet turned out equally and forming an angle of about 45 degrees. Knees straight without stiffness. Hips level and drawn back slightly; body erect and rest - ing equally on hips; chest lifted and arched; shoulders square and falling equally. Arms and hands hanging naturally; thumb along the seam of <the trousers. Head erect and square to the front, chin slightly drawn in; eyes strkight to the front. Weight of the body resting equally upon the heels and balls of the feet. The Rests 49. Being at a halt, the commands are: FALL OUT; REST; AT EASE; 1. Stand at, 2. EASE; and 1. Parade, 2. REST. At’ the command fall out, the Knights may leave the ranks but are required to remain in the imniediate vicinity. They resume their former places, at’ attention, at the com - mand fall ‘in. At the command rest, the Knight keeps one foot in place but is not required to preserve silence or immobility. At the command at ease, the Knight keeps one foot in place and is required to preserve silence but not immobility."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"24 IC! t i IlgiIIgtIM. nI ~v~NIIChtIIIgorguHJlI WW¶NtICIlti ngargus.id A’W,NtlChti ngargus. iii ww,N(ichtingargus. n I ww 4 stichtingargus.n I wW,stichtingargus. iii vw. stichtingargus. iii MW. stichtingargus.nI ~vw. stichtingargus.nl MW.Stichtingargus.nl ~~‘xv. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl MW. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus. ni vw. stichtingargus. ni vw.stichPngargus.nl vw.sticht ingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nI vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl 1W.Stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nI 1W.Stichtiflgargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nI rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.xtichtingargus.nl WsI icbtiflgargus.nl wad chtingargus.nl iv tdichtingargus.nl SCHOOL OF THE KNIGHT 1.

The instructor causes the squad to face half right or half left, points out to the Knights their relative positions and explains that these are to be maintained in the oblique march. 1. Right (left) oblique, 2. MARCH. Each Knight steps off in a direction 45 degrees to the right of his original front. He preserves his relative posi - tion, keeping his shoulders parallel to those of the guide (The ICaight on the right Eor left] front of the line or col - umn), and so regulates his steps that the ranks remain par - allel to their original front. At the command halt, the Knights halt, faced to the front. The command halt should be given on the left foot when halting from a right oblique, and on the right foot when halting from a left oblique. To resume the original direction: 1. Forward, ?- MARCH. - The Knights half face to the left in marching and then move straight to the front. If at a half step or mark time while obliquing the oblique march is resumed by the commands: 1. Oblique, 2. MARCH. The Route’ Step 72. 1. Route Step, 2. MARCH. At the command march, the Knights lengthen or shorten the step at will, so that it will break the cadence, and are not required to preserve silence nor keep step.

Squad, 2. FALL IN. At the command fall in, the tallest Knight takes position where the right is to rest, facing to the right. The Knights fall in quickly in rear, at a distance of ten inches, accord - ing to height. At the command, 1. Left, 2. FACE, they face to the left into line. Alignments 74. The instructor first teaches the Knights to align themselves man by man; to this end he advances the two Knights on the right, three or more paces, and having aligned them, commands: 1. By file, right (left), 2. DRESS, 3. FRONT. At the command dress, the Knights move up successive - ly in quick time, shortening the last step, so as to be about six inches behind the alignment which must never be passed; each Knight then executes Eyes Right, and moves on the line taking steps of two or three inches, places his right arm lightly against the left arm of the Knight on his right, so that his eyes and shoulders are in line with those of the Knights on his right, shoulder’s square, to the front. At the command front, given wh4n tl~=\\-~i¶ks are aligned, the Knights turn their heads and eyes smartly to the front. - 75. The Knights having learned to align themselves man by man, the instructor next aligns them by the com - mand: 1. Right (left), 2. DRESS, 3. FRONT. The base having been established, at the command dress, the entire rank moves forward and dresses up to the line as previously explainea. The instructor verifies the alignment from the right flank and orders up or back such men as may be in rear, or in advance of the line; only the men designated move- At the command front, given when the rank is aligned, each man turns his head and eyes smartly to the front. SCHOOL OF THE SQUAD Whenever the position of the base file or files necessitates a considerable movement by the squad, such movement will be executed by marching to the front or oblique, to the flank or backwards, as the case may be, without other command. Alignments to the rear are executed on the same prin - ciples, the Knights stepping back a little beyond the line, and then dressing up, by steps of two or three inches. The com - • mands are: - 1. By file, right (left), backward, 2- DRESS, 3. FRONT, or, I. Right backward, 2. DRESS, 8. FRONT. To March in Line 76. The Knights being correctly aligned, the instructor places a well instructed Knight on the side on which the guide is to be, and commands: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH. At the command march, the Knights step off smartly with the left foot, Par. 59, the Knight acting as guide march - ing straight to the front. The instructor observes, in marching in line, that the Knights touch lightly the elbow toward the side of the guide; that they open neither arm; that they yield to pressure coming from the side of the guide, and resist pressure com - ing from the opposite direction; that shortening or lengthen - of ing the step, they gradually recover the alignment and touch the elbow, if lost, and that they keep the head direct to the front, no matter on which side the guide may be. The instructor impresses upon the Knights that the alignment can only be preserved in marching, by the uniform- ity of the step, both in length and swiftness, by the touch of the elbow, and the niaintenance of the shoulders square with the line of direction. To March By the Flank 77. Being at a halt, the instructor commands: 1. Right (left), 2 FACE. I. Forward, 2. MARCH. If in march, the instructor commands: 1. By the right ‘~ (left) flank, 2.

Par. 52. In the march by the flank the Knights cover each other4 an(l keep to facing distance, that is, to such distance that in forming line the elbows ‘will touch. A rank faced to the right or left is called a column of files. To halt the column of. files, the instructoi commands: 1. Squad, 2. HALT, and, to face it to the front, 1. Left (right), 2. FACE. Matching in colunin of files, to march in line, the in - structor commands: 1. By the right (left) flank, 2. MARCH. To Change Direction in Column of Files 78. Being in march, the instructor commands: 1. Col - umn right (left); or, 1. Column half right (left), 2. MARCH. At the command march, the leading file turns to the r~ight, or half right, on a moving pivot (with radius reduced), followed by the other files, who turn on the same ground. To Oblique 79. Being well drilled in the principles of the direct march, the equad is taught to march obliquely. Marching in line, the instructor commands: I. Right (left) oblique, 2. MARCH - At the command march, each Knight makes a half face to the right, and then marches straight in the new direc~ioii. See par. 52-71. The Knights no longer touch eJ - bows, but preserve the line of the rank parallel to its former position by the eye only, glancing along the shoulders of the nearest file’~, toward the side to which they are obliquing, and regulating their steps so that the shoulders are about six inches behind the shoulders of the Knights on that side, and that the heads conceal the heads of the other Knights in the rank. The Knights all preserve the same length of step, and the same degree of obliquity. To resume the original direction, the instructor com - mands: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH. At the command march, each Knight makes a half face to the left in marching, and then moves straight to the front. If the squad be at a halt, the Knights half face to the right, at the command right oblique, and step off at the command march. Wheelings - 80.

Newly created Knights should at once be taught marching, drill and sword manual. Ease and grace can only be acquired by frequent exercise. Attention to minor de - tails is essential in order to avoid the forming of awkward habits or taking incorrect positions. Carry the sword with a flexible wrist and without grasping the gripe tightly. The gripe should be held, at position of carry, by the thumb and forefinger, as if holding a pen, and covering about two- thirds of the gripe below the guard. Each command is di - vided into motions of one-half of a second, which should, at first, be explained and executed separately without reference to cadence. On the march the cadence corresponds with the step. The manual may first be taught by calling the num - bers of motions, the command being prefaced by the words “By the numbers”, No. ONE being executed at the command swords, or other command of execution, then TWO, THREE, etc., until the command “without the numbers”, or until a command is given not in the sword manual. When on march if the swords are drawn and not at a carry, the Knights will, at the command halt, come to Carry Swords, without command. If in scabbard the left hand steadies same. While marching the hands may be allowed to swing forward and bach three or four inches for the sake of ease and grace of carriage. NOTE—With swords drawn or in scabbard, if desired, scabbards may be hooked up, uniformity being maintained. “Hooked up” means hanging by the front upper ring. If hooked up the scabbard must be unhooked before executing draw or return swords. 36 84.

He should be a model of promptness, dress, effi - ciency and appearance, should be devoted, enthusiastic and untiring, and to succeed must be a student and a gentleman. Discipline and courtesy are as essential among Tenitplars as with military men and must be maintained, yet the leader should not forget that his men are gentlemen, who out of ranks, are his peers. 138. Officers are described as those above and includ - ing the rank of Captain General, and Past Commanders; those under that rank are classed as junior officers, the dis - tinction being made to obtain the necessary parity with mil - itary formations and terms. However, in Templary no dif - ference in class is recognized, excepting in the measure of responsibility, templar rank usually being but temporary, and resulting often only from an accident of age or tenure. 138a. The laws and decisions of the Grand Encampment do not permit the wearing of the insignia of the U. S. Army, on the templar uniform, and it is also a technical violation of the National Defense Act. In large assemblies and or-~ ganizations some designatiun of templar military rank often seems necessary, but this need can be met only by authority of the Grand Encampment. II 139. The recommendation for systematic training in a school for officers and junior officers is here renewed. The requirements should be regular attendance, strict discipline, and prompt commencement and dismissal. After the oral lesson the squad should be thoroughly drilled in each move - p~ent. There should be the keenest attention and no talking in ranks. No faulty movement should ever be overlooked. The officers should alternate as instructors, and all should be practiced in giving commands. If the Commander is not in charge he should appoint a chief instructotr, preferably on permanent detail. 54 SCHOOL OF THE OFFICER 55 140. All drill commands to Templars under arms, mean - ing equipped with sword and accoutrements, are given with sword drawn. 141. Unless otherwise directed, officers (see Par. 143) omit the manual except the carry and order, parade rest, rest-on-swords, and kneelings; in rendering honors they exe - cute the present, un-cover and re-cover; they draw and return without command. p 142. Officers may be in “formation” but are never in “ranks,” unless temporarily so absorbed, when they will drill and present like other Knights. Whether in the station oC officer, junior officer, or Knight, by appointment or other - wise, a Knight Templar will always conform with the honors and courtesies relating to that grade. 143. Officers salute, by the officers present, or salute swords. Officers or junior officers, commanding companies, pla - toons, a division or an escort, will use the salute swords; at the command present, they will execute the present, and at swords. will take the position of salute swords. Officers in ranks taking the place of Knights, and all other junior officers, execute the present swords prescribed for Knights. 144. In double time, officers (see Par. 143) bring the sword across the body at an angle of forty-five degrees, edge out and about six inches in front of the breast, right hand forward, forearm horizontal, blade crossing opposite the left shiulder, left hand stcadyin~’ the scabbard (if not hooked up), right arm swinging easily. 145. When the Captain General, Adjutant, or other of - ficer in the Asylum or before the commandery, publishes or• ders, he will return his sword before reading the orders, then draw and come to the carry. 146. On drill or march the commanding officer goes wherever his presence is necessary, but in ceremonies every officer, junior officer and Knight must take the position and post prescribed. r"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ww.stichtingargus.nl ww~stichtingargus.n1 ww. stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl ww. stichtingargus.nl Nw. stichtingargus.nl kvwstichtingargus.nl ~vw. stichtingargus.nl Arw~stichtingargus.n1 Nw. stichtingargus.nl ~vw.stichtingargus.n1 vw.stichtingargus.nl vw~stichtingargus.n1 vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus~n1 vwwtkhtingargus~n1 vwJ4tichI ingargus~n1 vw.xticht ingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw~stichtingargus.n1 vw~stichtingargus.n1 iw. stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl vrw.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl rw .sticht ingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingatgus.nl rw.stichti ngargus.nI ‘w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl I w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus~n1 w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl FORMATION FOR PUBLIC PARADE With Standard Guard, Eminent Commander’s Staff, and Band 147.

The following is published for the information of all concerned: (a) In decorating with the National Flag, never festoon or drape it. Hang it flat. Par. 460. (b) If hung so stripes are horizontal, union should be in the left upper corner, (c) If hung perpendicularly, union should be in the left upper corner. (d) When carried in parades or crossed ‘with other flags, the National Flag should always be on the right. (e) The National Flag should never be placed below a person s[tting. The Eminent Commander and Staff 156. If the Eminent Commander does not assume the command, he will designate an Acting Cotmmander, Par. 2. The Em[nent Commander with his staff will then form on the right of the commandery, the left element on a line and six paces to the right of the right guide, Par. 157.

The Eminent Commander gives orders to his staff in a tone of voice loud enough to be heard by them only. If a large number of past officers are present, he may designate a Past Commander to direct them. The swords of the Emi - nent Commander and his staff are not drawn but carried at a secure, except at inspection or review, when if not drawn they may be hooked up. When the Eminent Commander is in command of the lines, the staff, if desired, may still be formed and maneu - vered as above described, under the direction of the senior officer or designated Past Commander. There is, however, no objection to its members being absorbed in the command - ery Lvrmation. The Band 157. The band, if present, will take position in close order, its front rank on a line with the commandery, its left, six paces to the right of the Eminent Commander, or the right guide. The Eminent Commander gives the order to move. If a marshal has been designated, see Par. 457, he, with his staff, precedes the band; the Eminent Commander, and staff, may likexvise do so at his pleasure.

Escorts of honor are detailed Cor the purpose of receiving and escorting commanderies and officials of high rank. The escort may consist of a commandery or of a sub - (livisi on. The Knights for this purpose should be selected for their knightly appearance and superior discipline. The escort forms in line opposite and facing the place where the commandery is quartered. The band will be on the flank of the escort toward which it will march. The commander of the escort will direct an officer to wait on the Commander and present his compliments, in - forming him that the escort is in readiness. The commandery, or distinguished party, marches past and in front of the escort and forms line and halts in pro - longation of line of escort, after passing the band, its flank twenty-four paces from the band of the escort. NOTE—Distances may be reduced as required by lack of numbers or space. When the head reaches flank of escort the escort will present swords and remain in that position until the rear has passed the band of the escort. The commandery or the personal escort to the distin - guished party, in marching past the escort will be at carry swords; the Commander and officers saluting with the sword, holding in that position until rear of command passes band of escort. When the commandery has passed escort and band, the escort will come to carry swords. When the commandery is in position, the escort will form in column of threes, or sections, and, headed by the band, march past the command ery, or distinguished party. 60 ESCOgTS OP HONOR 61 The escort will be brought to carry swords in marching past, the off leers saluting, as before erplained. The command~ry or escort in line will present swords as explained. When the rear of escort has passed, the commandery in line will break into column and follow at twenty-four paces • distance. An officer will be detailed to accompany the command - ery escorted and assist them in the arrangements. When an officer of high rank is to be escorted an officer will be detailed to attend him. The escort will receive him with present swords. When the escort arrives at destination it will form line and halt while the commandery marches past. The same honors will be given as before explained, ex - cept that the commandery does .not halt, but continues on to its quarters. If the escort is also to go to quarters with the commandery it will follow as explained. When the position of the escort is at a considerable dis - tance from the point where the commandery or official is to be received, as, for instance, where a courtyard or wharf intervenes, a double line of Knights is posted from that point to the escort, facing inward; the Knights will successively salute as the commandery or official passes and will then join the escort.

Th. coin mandery should attend church at Jeast once a year. On arriving at the church the line is formed in front oC and fuolog the church. The eninmandery will present swords and the Standard Guard will march into the church in column of files. WIwn the Standard Guard enters the church the com - wruilery will be brought to carry swords. ‘i’he Colors will form line facing the chancel at the order. The color bearer will advance and place the National Flag on the right in socket provided and stand at attention in front of it. The National Flag is placed at the right 0 C the chancel—not the right of the color bearer. The Standard, Beauceant and State Color will in like manner be deposited, the Standard Guard standing at attention. The commandery will return swords, enter the church at secure swords, in column of files, un-cover (with the right hand) and be seated at a signal or command of the com - mander. The Standard Guard will be seated at the same signal. NOTE—If the attendance is large, entrance and egress should be made in two or more columns by different doors and aisles. After the services the commandery will march from the church in column of files (may be left in front), axid re-form line facing the entrance. The Standard Guard will take the banners, reform column of files with the National Flag in front and march out of the church. When the National Flag appears at the entrance the Commander will command: 1. Present, 2. SWORDS, face to the front and present sword. The Standard Guard will form in line six paces in front of the Commander, facing the commandery, the National Flag on right, and march to its post; when they have arrived in line the commandery will be brought to carry swords. The commandery will then be marched to the Asylum and dismissed. NOTE—It is permissible to carry the Grand Standard on Church Parade, or better, it may be demounted and set up in the church. 62 I HONORS AND SALUTES 160. The composition consisting of the words and music known as the “Star Spangled Banner” is designated the National Anthem of the United States of America. At all parades and ceremonies under arms, the command - ery will render the prescribed salute and will remain in the position of salute while the National Anthem is being played. If not under arms, the commandery will be brought to attention at the first note of the National Anthem, or To The Color, and the salute rendered by the officer in command. When the National Anthem is played at any place where Sir Knights ‘are present, all not in formation will stand at attention facing toward the music; if the National Flag is present they will face toward it. If in uniform or civilian clothes, covered, they will un - cover at the first note of the anthem, holding the head dress on the right shoulder, and so remain until its close, except that in inclement weather the head dress may be slightly raised. If uncovered, they will salute with the hand, at the first note of the anthem, retaining the position oF salute un - til the last note. The same rules apply when To the Color is sounded as when the National Anthem is played. The National Anthem shall be played through without repetition of any part not required to be repeated to make it complete. The playing of the National Anthem as part of a med - ley is prohibited. 161. Sir Knights not in formation will on all occasions salute the National Flag when carried by a body authorized by law or regulation to carry it. When the National Flag passes a commandery or sub - division of Knights they will be brought to attention and the Commander and officers will salute. Officers, only, will salute while marching in formation. The Knights will be at carry swords when marching honors are given. 63"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ww. stichtingargus.nl 3 ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl ww. stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl NW. stichtingargus.nl NW.stichtiflgargus.nl NW. stichtingargus.nl Nw.stichtingargus.nl NW.Stichtingargus.nl Mw. stichtingargus.nl Mw.stiChtingargus.nl Mw.stiChtingargusail Mw. stichtingargus.ril ~‘w.~tichlingargus. ni VWNtkhti ngargus.nl vw,nlicht I ngargus.nl vw. sti cli t i ngargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ~‘w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nI ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtirigargus.nl w.stichtirigargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl 64 HONORS AND SALUTES 162. In rendering honors the commandery or subdivision will be taced to the front; they will not present swords when racing to a flank. 163. In order to promote a more general reading of the first page of the Ritual an extract is here inserted: “0 Cficers will salute with sword or hand, according as the sword is drawn or in the scabbard. Upon addressing or being addressed the junior will always make the first salute, which will be acknowledged by the senior. “If the salute is with the sword, both come to carry simultaneously and stand at attention; or the junior may stand at salute while making a short report. “They should always exchange salutes at the close of the conversation. “The S. l~l. (or E. C.) if seated, does not rise to ac - knowledge a salute, and the H. P. (or P.), in robes, salutes and acknowledges salutes by bowing ceremoniously. “An officer should always have his sword drawn when giving a cominand” to Knights under arms. 164. Only the presiding officer may salute sitting, ex - cept as herein provided. Sir Knights seated in open conveyances, passing in re - view, will rise, face the reviewing officer and salute with the hand. If the conveyance is closed they will sit at attention, execute eyes right (left) and salute with the hand. Inat - tention, slouching or smoking when passing in review \\or on parade is inexcusable. 165. The Grand Master, the Grand Commander, and their representatives, and Past Grand Commanders, are the only Sir Knights entitled to be received under an arch of steel. 166. Sir Knights should exchange salutes, the Knight or officer Junior in rank saluting first. Officers and Knights, covered or uncovered, but not in formation, without swords or with sword in scabbard, salute with the hand salute, holding the hand to the chapeau or cap until the salute is acknowledged or the officer passed. At no time—no place—or under any circumstances, is a sword drawn to acknowledge a salute already given. HONORS AND SAI~UTES V 65 When in ranks Knights never uncover or salute except by command. Never salute and uncover at same time. An officer is “in formation,” but never is “in ranks.” A Knight in ranks will not salute when directly ad - dressed but will come to attention if at rest orat ease. If two commanderies or subdivisions meet, their com - manders will exchange salutes, both commands being at at - tention. When passing in review an officer salutes, executing eyes right, and looks toward the reviewing officer when he is six paces from him; and returns to the carry and turns the head and eyes to the front when he -has passed six paces beyond him. The Commander, if seated, acknowledges a salute with the hand, without rising. 9ff leers and Knights, in replying to a question from the Commander or other superior, rise and salute. The title of the Commander or other superior should not be given with the salute. The Prelate, when in uniform, salutes the same as other officers; if in robes, he salutes and acknowledges a salute by bowing ceremoniously. During the opening, closing, and other ceremonies in the Asylum, and on field ceremonies, all officers taking part will draw and return sword at the proper time without command. 167. All Sir Knights not in formation passing the un - covered National Flag, or when the National Flag passes, will render honor as follows: If in uniform and sword drawn they will salute with the sword; if in uniform and covered, or if in civilian dress and covered, they will uncover, holding the head dress on the right shoulder with the left hand; if uncovered, they will salute with the hand salute. All hand salutes are given with the right hand. Every National Flag in a passing Templar parade will be saluted. No honors are paid when on route marches. No salutes are rendered when marching in double time. win ~~mu"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ww. stichtingargus iii ww.siichtingargus .al ww.stichtingargus.al ww.stichtingargus.nl ww. stichtingargus .nl ww.stichtingargus.nl kvw.stlchtingargus.nl ~vw. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ww. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl ~vw.stichtingargus.n1 vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni VWNtichti ngargus.nl vw.uticht ingargus.nl vwstichtingargus.nl vwstichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus iii vw. stichtingargus .nl vw. stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl vrw.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingafgus .nl ‘w.stichtingargusni ‘w. stichtingargus.ni w. stichtingargus. ni w. stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus ii w. stichtingargus ni w.stichtingargus. ni 66 OFPhIAL TEMPLAR HONORS A mounted Sir Knight dismounts before addressing an officer not mounted. A mounted officer dismounts before addressing a super - ior officer not mounted. Wheti several officers in company are saluted, all who tao entitled to the salute return it. OFFICIAL KNIGHT TEMPLAR HONORS 168. The honors to be paid by Templars, beyond true knightly courtesy, are such as are due to the official position held by such officers. The Grand Master is saluted with the highest honors; all standards and banners dropping, officers and Sir Knights saluting, bands, trumpets, or field music, sounding “Presi - dents’ March.” The Deputy Grand Master is received with standards and banners dropping, officers and Sir Knights saluting, bands, trumpets, or field music, sounding “General’s March.” All other officers of the Grand Encampment, and a Grand Commander, within his own grand jurisdiction, are received with standards and banners dropping, officers and Sir Knights saluting, trumpets sounding three flourishes. A Grand Commander, outside of his own grand jurisdic - tion, is received with standards and banners dropping, officers and Sir Knights saluting, trumpets sounding two flourishes. A Deputy Grand Commander, the Grand Generalissimo, the Grand Captain General and Past Grand Commanders, within their own grand jurisdictions, are received xvith stan - dards and banners dropping, officers and Sir Knights salut - ing, trumpets sounding two flourishes. Outside of their own grand jurisdiction they are entitled to but one flourish. All other grand officers, within their own grand juris - dictions, are received with standards and banners dropping, officers and Sir Knights saluting, trumpets sounding one flourish. Outside their own grand jurisdiction the flourish is omitted. An Eminent Commander is saluted by his own command - ery with standards and banners dropping, officers and it ‘4 ESCORT OF THE COLOR 67 Knights saluting, trumpets sounding one flourish. Outside of his own commandery he is not entitled to the flourish. The officer commanding a battalion is entitled to the same salute. ESCORT OF THE COLOR U 169. This cetemony, while most suitable for the forma - tion of a grand commandery, may be used by a commandery, or by several commanderies in battalion or regimental forma - tion. If several commanderies are pre~ent the colors should be massed. See Public Parade, Par. 147. Selection as escort is a mark of special distinction usu - ally accorded to a company or commandery for proficiency in drill and appearance. The commandery or larger organi - zation being in line, with space reserved for the Standard Guard, the commanding officer details a platoon, company or commandery, to escort the Colors to their place in line. The escort is formed in column of platoons, or if a pla - toon, in column of sections, the band in front. The escort then marches, without music, to the temporary station of the Standard Guard, which should be near the right flank of the line, and forms line, facing the Standard Guard, the band on the right, and presents swords; the band gives the ruffle and the field music, if present, sounds to the color. Swords are brought to the carry, and column of pla - toons formed, the band taking post in front of the column; the Standard Guard places itself between the platoons, the escort marches with guide left, the band playing, and is so conducted that when the escort arrives at fifty paces in front of the line, the direction of the march shall be parallel to its front; when the Standard Guard arrives opposite its place in line, the escort is formed in line to the left; the Stan - dard Guard passing between the platoons, advances and halts twelve paces in front of the commanding officer.

The escort presents swords and comes to the carry with the command, after which it is formed again in column of J)Iatoons, and, preceded by the band, marches to its place in line, passing around the left flank of the line. The band plays until the escort passes the left of the line, when it ceases playing and returns to its post on the right, passing in rear of the line. The command may be brought to a rest when the escort passes the left of the line. ¶ 4 DRILL CORPS AND COMPETITIONS 170. Nothing contributes more to the interest and esprit of a commandery, than a thoroughly competent and well sup - ported drill corps. Competitions increase interest and effi - ciency only when conducted according to the highest stan - dards of Knightly courtesy and true sportsmanship. The fol - lowing suggestions for adoption by commanderies and grand commanderies are made for the information and encourage - ment of all concerned. A. drill corps should be formed in every commandery for training in drill and ceremonies, the inculcation of discipline, and general improvement in the action and life of the commandery. While the drill corps must develop indepen - dence of action and initiative, it should always be under the control of the commandery. Its officers may be a p pointed by the Commander or by the Council, or elected by the mem - bers of the corps, but must be selected with the greatest care, and be always subordinate to the authority of the commandery. The Commander of the corps, who occupies the position of “Commander” in these regulations, is by far the most im - portant. If not the author, he is indeed the inspiration and builder of the corps. Every commandery should endeavor to develop a man of the requisite qualifications, and should give him every possible encouragement and support. Only results count, and when obtained, the leader should not be disturbed in his tenure nor hampered in his plans. The same may be said, only in lesser degree, of the other officers, junior officers and Knights, who are willing to per - form the necessary sacrifice and labor, and to whom should be assigned the most effective positions, with the greatest possible permanency, and the largest measure of appreciation and support. In cities and districts having several contiguous com - manderies, the organization of perm~wnt jattalions and reg - iments should be encouraged. 69 ~1 ‘xv. stichtingargus.n1 ‘w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus ni xv. stichtingargus ni xv.stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"wxv. stichtingargus .nl ww.stichtingargus .nl wxv.stichtingargus .al ww.stichtingargus .al ww. siichtingargus .al ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl NW. stichtingargus.nl AflN.stlchtingargus.nl NW. stichtingargus.nl NW.Stichtingargus.nl Mw.Stichtiflgargus.nl Mw. stichtingargus.nl Mw.Stichtingargus.nl Mw.Stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.michtingargus.nl vwbtlehti ngargus.nl vwuticht ingargus.nl v w. sti elM ingargus.nl vwstichtingargus.nl vwstichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vxv.stichtingargus.nl vxv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl ~‘xv. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus .nl rxv. stichtingargus .nI ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus. ii w.stichtingargus.nl I W. st ichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus ni w.stichtingargus. El 70 (N tibi PETITIVE DR ILLS Competitive Drills 171. ‘I’he Scheflule Plan provides for a specific schedule of movements to be placed in the hands of the Captain, by the drill committee, not more than thirty minutes prior to the appearance of his drill corps on the field; that all the required movements shall be taken from the drill regulations of the Grand Encampment, Knights Templar of America; that the schedule shall be known only to the committee, and that no Captain may witness the drill of any preceding team. NOTE—As an encouragement to entry, it is also per - missible when the schedule plan is used, to publish the sched - ule in advance, to facilitate the preparation of competitors. For Grand Commanderies, this is g’enerally recommended. 172. The Program Plan does not prescribe a list of movements, but furnishes a program showing the class and value of movements which will be judged; as “Alignments, fifteen points,” “Wheelings, fifteen points,” “Sword manual, ten points,” “Facings, five points,” etc., which is published with the announcement of the competition. Experience proves that by this plan it is possible for a drill corps to perfect and memorize a schedule containing the required points, and execute the same faultlessly, without possessing either exper - ience or a high degree of proficiency or general knowledge of the drill regulations. The conclusion reached therefore, is that while the pro - gram plan may afford encouragement to beginners, the schedule plan is the only real test of all round efficiency in drill, and should be applied in all higher class contests and particularly for national competitions such as occur at the Triennial Conclaves of the Grand Encampment. Judges 173. The question frequently arises concerning the rel - ative advantage of Knights Templar or professional soldiers, as judges; the latter being frequently preferred because of their exact knowledge of drill, and because disinterested and impartial. Modem military science tends constantly to in - crease the importance of extended order and training for COMPETITIVE DRILLS 71 combat, as compared with the close order drill, upon which all Knights Templar formations are based. With these close order formations as well as with the significance and his - torical value of our commandery display movements, and our peculiar uniform and equipment, Knights Templar, many of whom have army training, are constantly familiar; cer - tainly no question can be raised of a lack of ability, or char - acter, or sportsmanship on the part of Templars. It is, P therefore, recommended that Templar judges be habitually employed in all competitions of the Ordei-. RULES FOR’ COMPETITIVE DRILLS Preamble 174. The object of drill competitions is to create enthus - iasm in the Templar body and perfect Knights Templar drill, without which the Order cannot make a creditable appearance in public. It is believed the competitions of the Grand Encampment should be conducted under a plan which will fully test the proficiency of those participating, particularly the officers, who should be trained to think and act quickly, and that a specific numbered schedule given out shortly before the com - petition, will best accomplish ~this The schedule should never contain “catch commands” and usually only the fundamental and symbolic formations and movements; the preparation of contestants being facili - tated by the elimination of all other paragraphs by the or - ders and rules of the competition.

On inspection the first judge receives honors, inspects swords, baldrics, gloves, chapeaux, faces, collars, the sword movement and the general appearance of the commandery. The second judge inspects coats, belts, trousers, shoes, and position of the Knight. In battalion competitions the first judge will mark the buttalion commander, adjutant, sergeant major, bugler and battalion alignments and omissions. Each of the other four judges as assigned by the first judge, will score and mark one company throughout the in - spection and drill. Should one judge be unassigned he will mark the cadence, length of step and time. (b) The scoring will be based on a total of iooo points. (c) Should it be desired for any reason to give a higher rating the possible total may be increased to 1500 or 2000, or the total of the cuts may be divided by two or any other divisor, and the quotient subtracted. (d) In battalion competitions the average of the com - manderies (companies) should be subtracted. This will be obtained by dividing the sum scored against all the com - manderies by the number of commanderies in the battalion. This same rule of averages might also be applied to platoons in commandery (company) competitions. [t will be observed that these methods of increasing scores would not affect the relative standing of the contestants. (e) Each Commander should be furnished a summary of the score of his team, showing the markings in detail. (f) For state competitions a lesser number of judges may be employed if desired. It will always be important that the duties of the judges and the accountant be assigned in advance to admit of thorough preparation. The names of the judges should not be announced before the commencement of the competition. COMPETITIVE DRILLS 77 (g) The schedule should be printed, preferably on both sides of a small card, in form convenient for use by Coin - manders and Judges. (h) Score cards are here illustrated.

If the Program Plan is adopted the same rules and • procedlure is applicable with the following exceptions. Since each team decides for itself the movements to be executed, all reference to “Schedule” will be omitted.

The commandery, platoon or detachment is habit - ually formed in single rank. Par. 1S9. For special occasions and formations, fours or twos may be used, but the unit of threes is enjoined by these regula - tions, and is always recommended. The Commander is responsible for the instruction of his officers and junior officers not only in the duties of their respective grades but in those of the next higher grades; but while giving them thorough instruction in the methods of training and command, he must be careful not to curtail their initiative. The commandery will be divided into platoons usually of not less than two or more than four sections each, equal in strength unless the left platoon is smaller. Companies may be formed of not less than two platoons each, which will gen - erally be determined by the number of available officers. Within these limits the permanency of platoons and com - panies should be maintained. The formations of the commandery are: line, column of companies or platoons (at full distance or in close column), line of companies or platoons, (at full or close intervals), and column of threes or sections. At the formation of the commandery, the platoons are numbered consecutively from right to left and these designa - tions do not change. Officers and junior officers will be assigned as company and platoon leaders, and guides. A commandery of less than four sections may be commanded by the Commander as a single platoon. 179. When numbers and space permits, the column of sections or platoons in preference to threes should always be formed for review, both in and out of the Asylum, and for street parades and other public ceremonies, as being more 79"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"U —._____________________ ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus .nl ww.st ichtingargus .nl ww.stichtingargus .nl ww.st ichtingargus.nl ww. stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus.nI ww.stichtingargus . ni bvw.stichtingargus.nl Arw.stichtingargus.nl Nw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus .nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.atlchtingargus.nl vw,ntlcht ingargus. ni vw. sa cht i ngargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.

The column of sec - tions may also very properly be made the route formation of the comxnumclory. 180. The descriptions and plates in these regulations, in anawer to the requirements of highly specialized drill, pro - vide for right and left guides of each platoon. When limited, however, by lack of numbers or skill, it is permissible for a comniandery to omit interior guides or the guides entirely, employing the second and third officers alternately as guides awl platoon leaders. Interior Guides may even be omitted from competitive drills, when so provided by the rules of the competition. The commandery or company in line, interior guides will be in the line of file closers, opposite the second Cue from the left and right of their respective platoons. The right and left guides of the flank platoons will be respectively the right and left guides of the commandery or company. 181. As instructor, the Commander goes wherever his presence is hecessary. In line, his ppst is three paces in front of the center of the commandery; in column of files, twos, threes, and sections, by the side of the leading guide, on the flank opposite the file closers; in column of platoons or companies, three paces in front of the chief of the leading subdivision; in line of platoons or companies, in column of threes or sections, three paces in front of the leading guides and opposite the center of the interval between the leading subdivisions. At the command to dress, unless otherwise provided, the commander or platoon leader places himself in prolongation of the line, two paces from and facing the flank toward which the dress is made, verifies the alignment, commands front and takes his post. 182. Chiefs of platoons are posted as follows: (a) In line, in the line of file closers two paces in rear of their res - pective platoons; (b) the commandery in column of files, twos, threes, or sections, in the line of file closers two paces opposite the center of their platoons; (c) in column of SCHOOL OF THE COMMANDERY 81 platoons, two paces in front of their platoons; (d) in line of platoons, by the side of the leading guide. The Standard Guard 183. In these Regulations, while no provision is made for the Standard Guard in the drill and display movements of the commandery, it may be used if desired and when present, will take position and maneuver as indicated in the text, or as may be determined by the commanding officer. See “Formation for Public Parade,” Par. 147. The Standard Guard is composed of the Standard Bearer, Sword Bearer, Warder, and Color Bearer, if present, any or all of whom may be replaced by temporary detail, when exig - ency requires. The Sword Bearer commands the Standard Guard, marches on its right, and does not carry a banner. When the state color is present it will be borne by an extra color bearer, who will march on the left of the Standard Bearer. NOTE—Since it is the duty of the Standard Bearer to “Displgy the banner of our Order,” and since the National Flag must always be on the right, it is suggested that a Color Bearer be detailed to carry the National Flag. In some jurisdictions the State Flag is also carried, although not authorized by the Grand Encampment nor recognized by the Ritual. When carried it should be ‘on the left of the Standard Bearer and by an extra Color Bearer. The military and ceremonial functions of the Standard Guard will be best fulfilled if the Warder does not carry a banner. The forma - tion of the Standard Guard would then be, a front of four (or five), from right to left; Sword Bearer, in command; Color Bearer with National Flag; Standard Bearer, with Beauceant or Grand Standard; Extra Color Bearer with Slate Color, if present; Warder. Should the Warder carry the National Flag he should march on the right of the Standard Bearer. Sir Knights bearing flags or banners may lay aside the sword, or if carried it should be in scabbard, hooked up.

Tho platoon usually consists of not less than twelve files, commanded by an officer or junior officer, designated as platoon leader. When composed of not less than twenty- four files, a company of two platoons may be formed com - mancled by an officer or junior officer designated as com - pany loader. Right and left guides of the platoon should be desig - nated from the junior officers; if no guides are present the flank files of the platoon act as guides. The allgnments are executed as prescribed in the school of the s4uad, the guide being established instead of the flank file. When platoons are to be dressed, platoon leaders give commands and place themselves as follows: The commandery or company in line he gives the command dress and taked his post; in column of platoons he places himself two paces from and facing the flank toward which the dress is made, and after dressing his platoon, commands front, and takes his post. Platoon leaders repeat such preparatory commands as are to be immediately executed by their platoons, as forward, threes or sections right, etc., the Knights execute the com - mands march, halt, etc., if applying to their platoons, when given by the commander. In movements executed in route step or at ease the platoon leaders repeat the command of execution if necessary. Platoon leaders do not repeat the commander’s commands in executing the manual of the sword, nor those commands or parts of commands which are not essential to the execution of a movement by their pla - toons, as, column of threes, first platoon threes right, etc. In giving commands or cautions, platoon leaders may prefix the number of their platoons, as First platoon, halt; Second pla - toon, threes right, etc. When the formation admits of the simultaneous execu - tion of movements by platoons, the commander may cause such movement to be executed by prefixing, platoons to the command prescribed, as, 1. Platoons Right front into line, 2. SCHOOL OF THE COMMANDERY 83 MARCH. To complete such movements the commands halt or march are given by the commander. When separately formed the command front is given by the platoon leader. 185. The commandery, company or platoon in column of sections, threes, twos or files, forms column and reforms subdivisions as explained in the school of the squad and school of the commandery; also executes the halt, rests, fac - ings, steps and marchings, manual of the sword, respmes attention, kneels and rises as explained in the school of the squad; and executes threes or sections right (left), threes or sections right (left) about, route step, and at ease, and obliques and resumes the direct march as explained in the school of the squad and school of the commandery. The same rule applies to detachments, escorts, etc., substituting their designation in the commands. 186. When interior guides are not present, wheeling from line into column of platoons, the rear guide will pass to the opposite flank and follow in trace of the leading guide- Wheeling into line from column of platoons, he will pass so as to be in his post on completion of the wheel. In passing he moves in front of his platoon or by the shortest route, in dou - ble time. In all wheels, the guide on the marching flank keeps the pivot constantly in view; to this end, the Knight next to him keeps the line of his shoulders a little to the rear, but in the same direction. In wheeling on a fixed pivot, when the subdivisions are halted, the command halt is given when the marching flank is about three paces from the perpendicular to the original position- In wheeling on a moving pivot, the command forward is given in sufficient time, to add march the instant the wheel is completed. In all wheelings by threes or sections the forward march is taken up on the completion of the wheel unless the com - mand halt is given. In forming line from column of platoons, if the platoons are unequal, the guicW should first be announced on the flank"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"I ww.stichtingargus ni ww.stichtingargus ni ww.stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus ni ww.stichtingargus .nl ww.stichtingargus .nI ww.stichtingargus.nI ww.stichtingargus.nl ww. stichtingargus .nl ~‘vxv.stichtingargus.n1 ~vxv.stichtingargus.n1 - NW.stichtingargus.nl NW.stiChtingargus.nl MW. stichtingargus .nl 4Txv.stichtingargus.nl vxv. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus. nl vw,HiicIlti ngargus.nI VWJ4tICht ingargus.ril vwsticht ingargus.nl vwstichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vwsti chtingargus .nl ~xv.stichtingargus .nI ~xv. stichtingargusnl ixv. stichtingargus.nl ixv.stichtingargus.nl ~‘w.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus nl rxv. stichtingargus nI ‘wstichtingargus.nI ‘WstlChtlngargus. ni ~w. stichtingargus.nl w.sti chtingargus.xil xv.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl xv- sti chti ngargus .nI w.stichti ngargus ni w. stichtingargu sni 84 (WNERAL RULES toward which the wheel is made, and the alignment of the guides effeoted be fore the command march is given. 187. :~n computing distances the breadth of a Knight is taken at twenly-two inches, and his depth at twelve’ inches; this gives b~n inches from breast to back (facing distance) between i~anks in column of files, between ranks in column or twos, thirty-two inches, between ranks in column of I lireos, fifty-four inches, and between ranks in column of see - LIon~ one hundred twenty inches.

File closers on left (right) flank, 2. MARCH; at the first command the file closers close to the column, and at the command march, they dart through; the commander and guides change to the other flank. Guides and f]le closers will give such commands and cau - tions as may be necessary or as directed by the commander; this to apply to guides of all subdivisions. In column of threes or sections each rank preserves the alignment toward the side of the guide.

In assembling the guides and file closers resume their positions in line. To Form the Commandery 189. At the sounding of the assembly, the Senior War - den (or senior junior officer, right guide) facing the pro - posed line of formation, and six paces in front of the center, commands: Fall in, at which the Knfghts form in single rank facing to the right, graduated in size from front to rear, tall - est in front: the swords in scabbards. The signal having ceased, he commands: 1. Left, 2. FACE, 3. Sir Knights, 4. Draw, 5. SWORDS. If the roll is to be called, he first brings the commandery to support, and calls the roll. Each Knight answers “here”, and brings his sword to a carry, as his name is called. He then commands: 1. Count, 2. THREES; at this command, all except the right file e~ ecute eyes right, and commencing at the right, the Knights count in a sharp, quick tone of voice, one, two, three, etc. Each Knight turns his head and eyes to the front as he counts. He then commands: 1. Ones, 2. COUNT. When the numbers one of each three, except the first, execute eyes right and count in the same manner, one, two, three, four, etc., from right to left, and immediately turn the head to the front. The odd threes constitute the right, and the even threes the left, of sections. Unless otherwise designated by the commander, the left guide of each section will be its Chief. Chiefs of sections as - certain the relative position of their sections in line, when ones are counted. Each chief of section divides the number counted by his section by two; the quotient represents the number of his section: e. g., should his number be eleven, divided by two, the quotient five, tells him that five sections precede his own. If the Standard Guard be present, see Par. 148-183. Twos are then counted on the same principles, and, if the passion cross is to be formed, fours may be counted in the same manner."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"~rn ww.stichtingargus.nl ww. stichtingargus.nl ww.stichtingargus .nl ww.stichtingargus .nl ww.stichtingargus.nI ww.stichtingargus .nl ww.stichtingargus .nl ww.stichtingargus.nI Arw.stichtingargus.nl Nw. stichtingargus.nl ~vw.stichtingargus.n1 ~vw.stichtingargus.n1 ww. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus .nl vw.stichtingargus .nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw,Ntichti ngargus.nl vw.iiticlitingargus.nl vw.srichtingargus.nl vw. s Ii chtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus .nl vw.stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus .nl iw.stichtingargus ni ~‘w.stichtingargus. ci iw.stichtingargus.nl. sw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nI ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus ni w.stichtingargus ni 88 ‘COMMANDERY DRILL He ,Qn&b’tdlv!des the commandery into platoons; after which~ ~Jne I.ft guide (Junior Warden) takes post on the left of th~ lAze, The Conimander takes post in front of the Commandery and Rt IL distance about equal to one-half the line.

If numbers permit the formation of two or more com - panies of not less than two platoons each, and it is desired, this will now be done by the Commander, who will designate the necessary leaders and guides. Companies should be sep - arately formed preparatory to the formation of the battalion. School of the Battalion, Par. 332.

Such subdivisions may be formed in column of subdivisions or otherwise as convenient, and closed in mass to any required distance, thus obviating the use of the double rank, which is always awkward and unsuitable, especially for the sword manual, the wheelings and asylum ceremonies.

When the march - ing flank passes the guide, he faces toward the center and marches on the pivot, facing to the front as the subdivisions unite in line. The guides alternately march away from, or toward the center, the file closers alternately toward and from the line; according as the subdivisions wheel toward, or away from them. The file closers mark time during the wheel by threes, and with the guides take post at the fifth com - mand as in column of platoons, Par. 81-253. At the seventh command they take post as in line, Par. 193. When platoons or larger subdivisions wheel in circle, the guide will be the pivot. A variation of this movement is effected, by alternating the commands so that the threes wheel to the right, the sections to the left, the platoons to the right, etc. The Standard Guard, if present, wheels in circle with the threes upon a fixed pivot; in the wheels by sections, it wheels upon a moving pivot, describing a circle large enough to en - able it to occupy its central position in column, and to unite with the sections in line. In the wheel by platoons, etc., it conforms to the same principles as in wheeling by sections.

The following movements are intended for public parade and display; they are arranged to conform to the gen - eral rules and principles previously laid down In display drill, for the purpose of forming emblematic figures, the Commander is often required to exercise his in - genuity to its utmost. It is impossible always to have the same number of Knights in line; and a slight variation in the number present necessitates a change in the formation to produce the required results. To form the passion cross with twenty-four Knights if it is desired to change from the unit of three to a unit of four, the Commander causes fours to be counted, preferably at the formation of the commandcry. It is also necessary to have the commandery divided into four equal parts in order ~ n~qA~. to form the Greek cross and Square.

A battalion is composed of two or more, not e~ - ceeding si~ commanderies or companies, -under one Com - mander. Large commanderies may be formed into two or more companies of not less than twenty-four files each, as heretofore provided, Par. [78. When possible to do so, it is best to have the battalions composed of four commanderies or companies each, and in this school they will be so con - sidered. In this school the terms “commandery” and “com - pany” are synonymous. While it is understood that the formation of the larger templar units will usually be confined to the ceremonies of grand comman(leries, in the case of large commanderies, or where several commanderies are contiguous, permanent bat - talions or provisional battalions and regiments may be formed to the great interest and advantage of all concerned. 333. The senior officer present is the instructor, in the text he is designated as Battalion Commander. Since the battalion is not an administrative unit, the staff is usually limited to two, the Adjutant and the Sergeant Major. • 334. When the commandery is formed as a battalion the Eminent Commander will assume his proper position as Battalion Commander, or will designate one qualified to do so, who may be the Generalissimo, the Captain General, a Past Commander, or other competent Sir Knight. 335. Companies in the same commandery may be desig - nated by numerals or letters, as First, Second; Third, etc., or Co. “A”, Co. “B”, Co. “C”, etc. 3a6.

For ceremonies, and even for drills, it is better to equalize the commanderies by transferring Knights from the larger to the smaller, or by dividing large commanderies into two or more companies. 338. Commatderies take rank according to date of charter, and in forming battalion for ceremonies, are posted in order of rank from right to left in line and head to rear in column. For drill or maneuvers they take position as di - rected by the battalion commander. Past Commanders and Past Grand Officers take rank ac - cording to the date of installation. When two or more battalions appear for parade the for - mation will be that of a regiment. The Regiment 339. A Regiment is composcd of three battalions but theso Regulations are applicable to a less or greater number. The senior officer present will command and will be desig - nated Regimental Commander. When the cominandery is formed as a regiment the Eminent Commander assumes the command, under the title of Regimental Commander, or designates the Generalissimo or Captain General, a Past Commander, or other competent Sir Knight, to do so, the other officers of the commandery being proportionately increased in rank. K 340. When several commanderies parade, they are under the authority of the Grand Commander, who if present, may assume command; in the absence of the Grand Commander, the ranking Grand Officer present, may assume the com - mend; in the absence of any Grand Officer, the Grand Com - mander may name an officer to take command, as his repre - sentative, or failing to do so, the officers of the Commander - ies present will elect a commanding officer. The command - ing officer will designate the officers to command the several battalions, such officers appointing their own staff officers, <A RULES—THE REGIMENT 341. When the Grand Commander assumes command, unless otherwise ordered, the Deputy Grand Commander acts as Chief of Staff and Executive Officer; the Grand Senior Warden as Adjutant (Asst. Adjt. Geni.), the Grand Junior Warden as Sergeant Major, and the Grand Treasurer as Quartermaster, while the remaining Grand Officers and Past Grand Officers, take position on the staff of the Grand Com - mander; Past Grand Commanders on the left of the Grand Captain General. 342. The commanding officer and battalion command - ers are designated field officers. The remaining Grand Of - ficers and Past Grand Officers are designated staff officers. 343. The Grand Commander takes post in front of the center of the Regiment, a distance equal to about half its front. In column the Grand Commander with his staff rides at the head, twenty-four paces in front of the band. The staff is six paces in rear of the Grand Commander, formed from right to left as follows: Adjutant, other officers, ac - cording to rank, senior on the right. The Grand Standard Guard, with a trumpeter dn its left, forms the rear line of the staff. 344. Field officers repeat commands whenever neces - sary; chiefs of commanderies, companies, and platoons only when prescribed. 345. All Grand Officers, and all field and staff officers, should be mounted, however, if not feasible to mount, all drills, ceremonies and parades of regiments and battalions may be executed on foot. At battalion drills the Adjutant and Sergeant Major should always be on foot. For street parades it is permissible for the Grand Commander and his staff to ride in carriages, the staff following in column in order of rank. Orderlies to mounted officers should be mounted. 346. Battalions in line are posted in order from right to left, and in column from head to rear, according to the rank of the commanders. 347. The interval between battalions in line is twenty - four paces."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nI w. sti chtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI 176 SCHOOL 01? THE BATTALION EVOLUTIONS OF THE BATTALION Position of Commanderies 348. Commanderies (companies) are designated numer - ically from right to left when in line, and from front to rear • when in column, first commandery, second commandery, and so on. The numbers of commanderies change whenever by facing in the opposite direction, the left becomes the right of the line, and the rear the head of the column.” If, in passing from line into column, the designation of commanderies is • changed, they hold their line designation till the column is formed, when they take the column designation. In like man - ner, if in passing from column into line, the designation is changed, they hold the column designation till the line is • formed when they take the line designation. I • Chiefs of commanderies caution (such) commandery, whenever the designation is changed. • When tbe number of commanderies is even, those to the right of the center of the battalion, regardless of the position of the Standard, constitute the right wing, those to the left, the left wing. • In drill, the left commandery of the right wing is desig - nated the right center commandery; the right commandery of the left wing, the left center commandery. The designa - tion of wings changes whenever the battalion faces in the opposite direction. When the number of commanderies is odd, the center commandery is part of the original right wing. Battalion Standard 349. The battalion Standard Guard is posted as the left three of the right center commandery until the battalion line is formed; when the commandery is halted in rear of the guides the Standard Guard, under the command of the Sword Bearer moves into line and takes post midway between the right and left center guides facing the front. In line the Standard Guard is between the wings, the interval between it and the guides is two paces. In line of commanderies in col - umn of threes, sections or platoons, the Standard Guard ‘is K BATTALION STAFF 177 midway between the wings and on line with the chiefs. In close column the Standard Guard is on the left flank of the color commandery. In column of commanderies, platoons or sections, the Standard Guard is midway between the wings and equi-dis - tant from the flanks of the column. In column of threes, the Standard is midway between the wings, preserving a distance of three paces from the guide in front. The Colors are delivered by the battalion commander into the hands of the Standard Bearers, and are escorted by the Standard Guard to the color-commandery, and in like manner escorted back. If, by movements of the battalion the Stan - dard Guard finds itself not between the wings, it takes post there as soon as practicable. The Standard Guard presents on receiving and parting with the colors; likewise the color commandery. For Standard Guard in regimental formation, see Par. 411. Posts of Officers and Battalion Staff 350. In line and in line of columns the battalion com - mander is posted about twenty paces in front of the center of the battalion; this distance to be reduced when the front of the battalion is less than sixty paces. In column, he is on the side of the guide, abreast of its center and about twenty paces from it, or if in march, at the head. As instructor, he goes wherever his presence is nec - essary. In column the Adjutant and Sergeant Major, each in his own wing, are on the side of the guide, opposite to and six paces from the head or rear of the column. In line, the Adjutant and Sergeant Major are opposite the right and left of the battalion, six paces in rear of the file closers. Chiefs of commanderies are posted three paces in front of their respective commands. The staff officers, in order of rank from right to left, take posts three paces in rear of the Battalion Commander. In formations for battalion drill they are dispensed with.

The Band 351. The band is posted on the right of the battalion, the left of its front rank twenty paces to the right of the battalion. Commands 352. Chiefs of commanderies repeat such preparatory commands as are to be immediately executed by their com - mands, as, forward, threes right, etc. The Sir Knights execute the commands, march and halt, • if applying to their commanderies, when given by the Coin- • mander. Chiefs do not repeat the commands of the battalion com - mander, for the manual of the sword,, nor those commands which are not essential to the execution of a movement by their commanderies as, close in mass, etc. To Form the Battalion 353. At the sound of the assembly, the commanderies form on their respective parade grounds; being formed, Ad - jutant’s call is sounded, at which the Senior and Junior War - dens (Adjutant and Sergeant Major), the latter on the left, and with swords in scabbards, march to the point where the base commandery is to form. The Adjutant posts the Ser - geant Major on the line at a little more than commandery distance from and facing himself. Both then draw swords. If mounted the Adjutant proceeds to the point where the base commandery is to form; the Sergeant Major reports to him and is posted on the line, etc. The right and left guides of each commandery precede it on the line by about twenty paces, in double time, and are posted as markers, at guide swords,, by the Adjutant and Sergeant Major. The guides of the color (right center) command ery are the first to ar - rive, and are posted 6n the line facing the left (point of rest).

The Adjutant aligns the guides in the right wing, placing himself in rear of the right guides as they successively arrive on the line. The line is similarly prolonged in the left wing by the Sergeant Major, who aligns the guides in their positions facing the right (point of rest), placing himself successively in rear of the left guides as they arrive on the line. 354. The guides, upon taking post on the line, bring their swords to the position of guide swords. Par. 111. This rule is general for all successive formations. 355. The color commandery (right center) is the first established, and is conducted by its chief so as to arrive from the rear, parallel to the line of marbers. When it arrives at one pace from the line, the chief halts it, places himself near the left marker facing to the front, and dresses the command - ery to the left, the breasts of the Knights opposite the mark - ers resting against their arms; the commanderies of the right wing form successively from left to right, each being halted at one pace from the line and dressed to the left as explained for the color commandery. The commanderies of the left wing form successively from right to left, and are dresssd to the right. Each commandery is halted and dressed so there is an in - terval of three paces between the guides when in line. 356. When approaching a line, a comniandery is halted by its chief when it is about one pace in rear of the line of markers. When commanderies are to be aligned, chiefs place them- - selves- on that flank toward which the dress is to be made, facing to the front. Par. 181. Each chief, after dressing his commandery, commands; Front, and takes his post. These rules are general. BATTALION DRILL 181 357. At the sounding of Adjutant’s call, the band, if present, marches together with the commanderies to its posi - tion in line. The battalion commander takes post, facing the line, and at a distance in front of its center, about equal to one-half its front. 358. The Adjutant having assured the position of the right guide of the right commandery, faces about, marches three paces to the right of the front rank, faces to the left, moves three paces to the front, faces to the left and halts, and, when the last commandery arriving on the line is brought to a front, commands: 1. Guides, 2. POSTS. At the command posts, the Sergeant Najor and guides take their posts in line. The Adjutant moves at a trot (if dismounted, in quick time), by the shortest route to a point midway between the Commanders and the Battalion Commander, halts, faces about, brings the battalion to a predent, resumes his front, salutes the Battalion Commander, and reports: Eminent Sir (or Right Eminent Sir), the battalion is formed. The Bat - talion Commander returns the salute with the right hand, directs the Adjutant, Take your post, Sir, draws his sword and commands: 1. Carry, 2. SWORDS. The Adjutant faces about, and returns to his post by the same gait and path as described above. 359. The battalion may be formed in line on the right or left commandery by the same principles; the guides being posted facing the point of rest; or, it may be assembled in column of threes; when assembled the Adjutant reports to the Battalion Commander as soon as the last commandery has tab en its place.

The chiefs of platoons and right and left guides and file closers take post as at the command open ranks, in - the school of the commandery. Par. 191. The Adjutant aligns the guides and then places himself facing to the left, in line with the Commanders, and three paces from the right flank. At the command march, ranks’ are opened. The commandery officers place themselves opposite their posts in line, three paces in front of the front rank, dress to • the right, and cast their eyes to the front as soon as their alignment is verified. The Standard Guard, if present, stands fast dressing to the right. The band takes three paces be - tween ranks, the alignment being verified by the drum major from the right. The Adjutant verifies the alignment of the officers, both • ranks, and the file closers, and then takes post facing to the • front, three paces to the right of the battalion, in line with the officers. The Battalion Commander gives the command front when the Adjutant takes his post. The guides and drum major return to their posts in line. Should the battalion have wheeled about by threes, the Sergeant Major performs the duties of the Adjutant. To Close Ranks 361. 1. Close ranks, 2. MARCH. At the command march, the platoon leaders face outward and return to their posts in line, and ranks are closed. Par. 192. To Rest the Battalion 362. 1. Battalion, 2. REST, or AT EASE. To resume the attention, the Battalion Commander com - mands: 1. Battalion, 2. ATTENTION. 363. Dismiss your commanderies (companies), at which command, each Commander conducts his commandery to its parade ground, where it is dismissed, as prescribed in the BATTALION DRILL 183 School of the Commandery. The Standard Guard escorts the colors to the quarters of the Commanding Officer. To March in Line 364. The battalion being at a halt, and correctly aligned: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH, 3. Guide center (right or left). At the second command the chiefs caution second (or such) commandery guide left (right) according ~is they are in the right or left wings. This rule is general. At the command march, the battalion steps off promptly, guiding on the center; the Standard Bearer, charged with the step and direction, preserves with care the cadence and length of step, and selects points in advance on which to direct his march. The guides march abreast of the Standard Bearer, and in step with him. The chiefs, in front of the centers of their commanderies, see that the guides preserve a general alignment, without abruptly shortening or lengthening the step, and that they preserve the interval of three paces between commanderies. To effect a slight change of direction while marching, the Battalioh Commander commands: Incline to the right (left) and indicates the new line of direction. The guide ad - vances his left shoulder, giving time for the alignment to conform to his movement. To Face the Battalion to the Rear and March It to the Rear 365. 1. Threes right (left) about, 2. MARCH, 3. Guide center (right or left). At the second command the battalion wheels about by threes; each chief of commandery and file closer darts through the nearest interval to their new positions in line.

The officers, guides, Standard Bearer, and file closers retain their relative positions until the battalion is again faced to,the original front until which no other movement will be executed. 367. To put the battalion in march and to halt it; to • march in the half step; to mark time; to change step; to march backward; to side step; to oblique; and to resume the direct march; to pass from quick time to double time, and the reverse, etc., are executed as esplained in the School of the Commandery. To Rectify the Alignment 368. Commanders, rectify the alignment. At this com - mand, the chiefs to the right of the Standard hasten to place themselves on the left of their commanderies, and dress them successively to the left, each as soon as the chief on his left commands front; the chiefs to the left of the Standard place themselves on the right of their commanderies and dress them successively to the right; each chief returns to his place in line after commanding front. 369.

At the second conimand, the guides of the other com - manderies take the same posts as in forming battalions. At the fourth command, the commanderies move up in quick time against the guides, where, having arrived, each> chief dresses his commandery to the flank toward which ‘his guides face. If the new line be oblique, and at a gonsiderable distance from the battalion, the chiefs remain in front of their com - manderies, and conduct them with the guide toward the cen - ter, so as to arrive parallel to the line, where they halt and dress as before explained. At the sisth command, guides return to their posts in line. If the new direction of the line be such that one of more commanderies rind themselves in advance of it, the Battalion Commander, before establishing the guides, causes these commanderies to be moved to the rear. To Pass Obstacles 370. Marching in line: 1. (Such) Commandery (or Coin- manderies) obstacle, 2. MARCH. If the obstacle covers but one commandery, its chief commands: 1. (Such) Commandery, 2.

In formation on right (left) into line, the first marker is established com - mandery distance to the right (left) of the head of the column. II (c) In formations front into line from column of threes or sections, they are posted commandery distance in front of the head of the column. In column of commanderies they are posted against the leading commandery. (d) In the deployments, they are posted against the lead - Pig commandery or the head of the column, when the deploy - ment is on the first subdivision; and six paces in front of the column, when the deployment is on a subdivision in rear. (e) In changes of front, the first marker is posted com - mandery distance to the right of the first, or left of the fourth commandery according as the change of front is to the right or left. The line is prolonged in the manner previously explained in formation of the battalion (Par. 353), by the guides of each commandery who are farthest from the point of rest; the guides are assured, as they successively arrive, by the officer at the head of the column, or nearest the point of rest. If the formation be central, the Adjutant and Sergeant Major F establish the guides of their own wings.

THE BRIGADE Formation 435. The brigade consists of three regiments, but the rules here prescribed are applicable to a less or greater num - ber. It is commanded by a Brigade Commander (Marshal). Regiments in line are designated right, center and left; or if one be in the rear, right, left and rear; in column they are designated leading, center and rear. Unless otherwise directed by the Brigade Commander, the regiments are posted according to the rank of the Regi - mental Commanders, Par. 338; in line, from right to left, the senior on the right; in two or three lines by regiments, the senior in the first line, the junior in the rear line; in column, from head to rear, the senior at the head. The ihterval between regiments is forty-eight paces. In line the Commander takes post one hundred paces in front of the center of the brigade; in column at the head of the brigade. The staff is six paces in rear of the Brigade Command - er; in the following order from right to left: The Chief of Staff, Adjutant General, aids in order of rank. The regulations for the evolutions of the regiment are The orderlies are three paces in rear of the staff. applicable to the brigade. In moving into position, the regi - ments and battalions are habitually marched in column of threes by the shortest practicable lines. The Commander of the base battalion, wh?n indicated, if marching, commands: Attention. Each of the other Com - manders commands: Attention, on approaching the point where he gives his command for placing his battalion in posi - tion in the new formation. Each Battalion Commander com - mands rest when his battalion is in position. 216 U REVIEWS General Rules 436. In the review of large templar bodies, the review - ing officer and field and staff officers, non-commissioned staff and orderlies, are usually mounted. The same general rules and principles, however, will be followed in the review of all bodies of Knights Templar, large or small, indoors or out of doors, and whether mounted or dismounted. The Adjutant posts men or otherwise marks the line of march of the column in such manner that its flank in passing will be about twelve paces from the reviewing officer. The post of the reviewing officer is indicated by a marker. Officers of the same grade as the reviewing officer or of higher grade, and distinguished personages invited to ac - company him, place themselves on his left or as otherwise indicated; their staffs and orderlies place themselves, res - pectively, on the corresponding side of the staff and order - lies of the reviewing officer; all others who accompany the re - viewing officer place themselves on the left of his staff or as otherwise indicated, their orderlies in rear. A staff off i - cer is designated to escot distinguished personages and to indicate to them their proper positions. 437. While moving around the lines, the reviewing offi - cer may direct that his staff and orderlies remain at the post of the reviewing officer, or that only his personal staff ac - company him; in either case, the commanding officer alone accompanies the reviewing officer. While passing around the lines, the commanding officer is on the flank of the reviewing officer away from the command. If the reviewing officer is accompanied by his entire staff, the staff officers of the Commander place themselves on the side of the staff of the reviewing officer corresponding to the position of the Com - mander. The reviewing officer and others at the reviewing stand salute the National Flag as it passes, whether the State Color 217"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"¶ w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargu S. ni w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. sf1 cht I ngargus.nl w. sti cht I ngargus.nl w. st;chti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. st;chtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nI w.sfichtingargus.nI 218 CEREMONIES and Beauceant salute or not; those with swords not drawn salute by uncovering; when passing around the lines the re - viewing officer and those accompanying him salute the Na - tional Flag when passing in front of it. The reviewing officer returns the’ salute of the command - ing officer of the lines only. Those who accompany the reviewing officer do not salute. 438. In passing in review, each staff salutes with its Commander. Without facing about, each subdivision leader commands: 1. Eyes, in time to add: 2. RIGHT, when at six paces from the reviewing officer, and commands: FRONT, when at six paces beyond him. At the command eyes, of fi - cers execute the first motion of present sword; at the com - mand RIGHT, all turn the head and eyes to the right and the officers complete salute sword; at the command FRONT, all turn the head and eyes to the front, the officers resuming the carry sword. Knights in ranks do not salute. The junior staff officers, junior officers in command of subdivisions and the drum major, salute, turn the head and eyes, return to the front, resume the carry or drop the hand at the points prescribed for the Battalion Commander. Offi - cers and junior staff officers, with swords in scabbards, salute with the hand. Guides charged with step, trace, and direction, do not execute eyes right. Sir Knights in conveyances, see Par. 164a. 439. After saluting the reviewing officer in passing ,in review, the commanding ‘officer of the lines turns out of the column and takes post on the side of the reviewing officer toward the direction of march of the command; the members of his staff accompany him, take post on the corresponding side of the reviewing officer’s staff. When the rear element of his command has passed, the commanding officer of the lines, without changing his position, salutes the reviewing officer; he and the members of his staff accompanying him then rejoin the command. The commanding officer of the lines and the members of his staff are the only ones who turn out of the column and take post at the side of the re - viewing officer. L 4, REVIEWS 219 440. If the person reviewing the command is not mounted, the commanding officer and his staff, on turning out of the column after passing the reviewing officer, dis - mount preparatory to taking post. In such case, the salute of the commanding officer, prior to rejoining his command, is made with the hand before remounting. 441. When the rank of the reviewing officer entitles him to the honor, each beauceant and state color salutes at the command Present swords, given or repeated by’ the Com - mander of the battalion with which it is posted; and again in passing in review. 442. The band of an organization plays while the re - viewing officer is passing in front and in rear of the organi - zation. During the march in review each band turns out of the column, takes post as hereinafter prescribed or as otherwise (lirected, continues to play until its regiment has passed, then ceases playing and follows in rear of its regiment; the band of the following regiment commences to play as soon as the preceding band has ceased. While marching in review but one band in each brigade plays at a time, and but one band at a time when within 100 paces of the reviewing officer. In large commands bands may be massed and posted as directed by the commanding officer. If the rank of the reviewing officer entitles him to the honor, the band plays the prescribed national air or the field music sounds to the color, march, flourishes, or ruffles when arms are presented. See Par. 168. When passing in review, at the moment the State Color and Beauceant salute, the musicians posted with the band sound to the color, march, flourishes, or ruffles. 443.

When the command repeated is Present swords, the colonel’s staff salutes at the command of the colonel; the major’s staff salutes at the command of the major; the colonel and majors salute after resuming their front; each staff returns to the carry or order at the command of its chief. The same rules apply to the colonels and majors and to the Brigade Com - mander’s, colonel’s and major’s staf I? whenever the Brigade Commander faces the line to give commands. When passing in review, the staff of each Commander salutes and ~eturns to the carry with him. 445. Whesi the general (marshal), colonel, or major faces the line to give commands, the staff and orderlies do not change position. 446. In reviews of regiments or larger commands, each battalion and special unit, after the rear has passed the re - viewing officer fifty paces, takes the double time for 100 yards in order not to interfere with the march of the column in rear, when necessary. 447. ]n a brigade or larger review, a Regimental Com - mander may cause his regiment to stand at ease, or fall out and resume attention, so as not to interfere with the cere - mony. 448. When an organizat[on is to be reviewed before an inspector junior in rank to the commanding officer, the com - manding officer receives the review and is accompanied by the inspector, who takes post on his left. 449. The march in review may commence from either flank of the command. When the march is to commence with the left flank, the command should be formed from left to right. The march in review is described in these Regulations as commencing with the right flank; appropriate changes in commands and movements are made when the movement is to commence with the left flank. w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.n] w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus ni BATTALION REVIEW 221 COMMANDERY REVIEW 450.

In Line 455. At the assembly, the commanderies are formed and inspected. At Adjutant’s call, each battalion is formed in line, on its own parade ground; the battalio’n adjutant takes his post in front of the center and receives the reports of the Com - manders as prescribed in battalion parade. ‘When the bat- talions are formed, Adjutant’s call is again sounded; the regi - ment is then formed in line, each Battalion Commander opening ranks in his battalion as soon as it is formed on the line, regulating on the base batta[ion; each battalion adjutant takes post on the right of the staff of his Commander. The Adjutant after indicating to the Adjutant of the base battalion the points of rest and direction the line is to extend, takes post facing to the left, six paces to the right of the first commandery of the base battalion and in line with the Battalion Commanders, and draws sword; wknn the line is formed, he informs the first battalion commander: Sir, the line is formed: the Battalion Commanders in succes - sion bring their battalions to parade rest. The Adjutant then turns to his left and commands, Sound off, and takes his post, facing to the front. The band, playing in quick time, passes in front of the Adjutant and field officers to the left of the regiment and back to its post on the right, when it ceases playing. When the parade is at retreat, the Adjutant turns to the left as the last note of retreat [5 sounding, and, when it is finished, commands: I. Battalions, 2. ATTENTION, 3. Carry Swords, 4. Present swords, and resumes his front; the Bat - talion Commanders bring their battalions to Present swords; the band plays The Star Spangled Banner. When the music ceases the Adjutant turns to the left and commands: 1. Carry, 2. SWORDS, then moves at a trot in front of the line of field officers to the center of the regiment, turns to the right and halts at a point midway between the commanding officer and the line, facing the regiment and commands: I. Present, 2. CEREMONIES 229 SWORDS; faces the commanding officer, salutes, and re - ports: Sir, the parade is formet. The commanding officer returns the salute and directs the Adjutant: Take your post, sir. The Adjutant takes his post on the right of the staff, passing by the commanding officer’s right. The commanding offic?r draws sword and commands: 1. Carry swords, and adds such exercises in the manual of the sword as he may desire, concluding with Carry swords. The commanding officer then directs the Adjutant to receive the reports. NOTE—The battalion is the largest unit habitually re - ceiving oral commands. For example the Regimental Com - mander commands: “Carry Swords,” which movement will then be executed by the battalions, simultaneously or suc - cessively, at the command of their respective chiefs. The Adjutant advances by the right of the commanding officer toward the line, halts midway between the command - ing officer and the line of the Battalion Commanders and commands: 1. Adjutants, 2. Front and center, 3. MARCH, or, 3. Trot, 4. MARCH. At the command March, the Battalion Adjutants move three paces to the front o.f the line of Battalion Commanders, close to the center and face to the front. The Adjutant then commands: Report, when the Battalion Adjutants, commenc - ing on the right, salute and report: First (or such) battalion, preselit or accounted for; or, First (or such) battalion, (so many) officers and Sir Knights are absent. The Adjutant returns the salutes of the Battalion Ad - jutants. The reports concluded, the Adjutant commands: 1. Adjutants, 2. Posts, 3. MARCH, or, 3. Trot. 4. MARCH. Each Battalion Adjutant returns to his post on the right of the staff of his Battalion Commander. The Adjutant then faces the commanding officer, salutes and reports: Sir, all are present or accounted for, or, Sir, (so many) officers and Knights are absent, including in the ab - sentees those from the band and field music reported to him by the drum major before the parade.

Officers, 2. Center, 3. MARCH, and takes post as before on the right of the staff. At the com - mand center, the commandery officers face toward the cen- ter, each battalion staff forms line on the left of its Com - mander. At the command march, the commandery officers close to the center and face to the front. The field officers and their staffs move by the flank to the right and left on their own line; those of the first battalion form in line six paces to the right of the line of the commandery officers; those of the second and third battalions form in line six paces to the - left of the line of the commandery officers. The commandery officers having closed and faced to the front, the senior Commander commands: 1. Forward, 2. Guide center, 3. MARCH. The commandery officers advance, the band playing, the left officer of the right wing of the second battalion, or the left officer of the first battalion, if there be but two battal - ions, is the guide and marches on the Regimental Commander. When the commandery officers have advanced to the line of field officers, the field officers and their staffs adA vance in line with the commandery officers. The line is halted at six paces from the commanding officer by the senior officer, who commands: 1. Officers, 2. HALT. The officers halt and salute, returning to the carry with the Regimental Commander, who then gives such in- structions as lie deems necessary, and commands: 1. Officers, 2. Posts, 3. Guide Center, 4. MARCH. At the command posts, commandery officers face about; at the command march, they step off, and when three paces from the line the senior commands: 1. Officers, 2. HALT, 3. Posts, 4. MARCH. At the command posts, they face outward, and at the command march, step off in succession at four paces dis - tance, and resume their posts and order sx~ords. At the command march from the Regimental Command - er, each Battalion Commander moves individually to the front, turns outward, and followed by his staff, takes his post by the most direct line. The music ceases when all offi - cers have resumed their posts. STREET PARADE 231 The Regimental Commander then closes ranks and com - mands: 1. Threes right, 2. MARCH, 3. Battalions, 4. HALT. 5. Pass in review, 6. MARCH, and returns his sword. The regiment is then marched in review, which concludes the ceremony. At the second change of direction, each Battalion Com - mander takes post fifteen paces in front of his leading com - mandery. The commanding officer precedes the band or the leading Battalion Commander twenty paces. In Line of Masses 456. The line is formed as prescribed in the Evolutions of the Regiment. The colors form on the left of the leading commandery of the center (right center) battalion. It re - joins the color commandery when the regiment changes from line of masses. Ranks are not opened, and Commandery officers do not march to the center; otherwise no change from parade in line. (See U. S. Infantry Drill Regulations.) 2 STREET PARADE 457. Street parades, especially those of the Grand Bodies, are ordinarily commanded by a Sir Knight designated as “Marshal” or “Grand Marshal.” (May be the Captain General or Grand Captain General.) The Grand Marshal appoints a chief of staff and aides, and issues a general order giving all necessary directions for the formation, movement and dismissal of the parade. This order should publish: 1st. The names of his staff officers, and when and where they, should report to him. 2nd. The names of the marshals of divisions and com - manders of brigades, etc. 3rd. The assignment of organizations to their positions in column. 4th. The streets upon which the different divisions and brigades will form, the direction in which their lines face, where the right will rest and the size of the front of the sub- divisions in column. w w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n[ w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.swiichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w.sw.ichtingargus.nl w.stlchtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl Ii 232 MASSED COLUMN 5th.

Massed Column (1) The impressiveness of a parade of Knights Templar can be greatly enhanced by massing all organizations in a solid phalanx, to march past the reviewing stand a second time. The exact formation will of course be determined by the width of the street, location of the reviewing stand or parade ground, etc., etc. It may be in column of platoons, companies or commanderies, #ithout distance, and should fill the street from curb to curb. The column may be composed of one or more battalions, a Grand Commandery, or a Divi - sion in a larger parade, but when well formed the beauty and dignity of this manifestation of Christian loyalty and power, never fails to impress and inspire. The description and illustrations here given can only be suggestive, since the final order of arrangement must always devolve upon the Commanding Officer, who will be governed by his resourcefulness and attendant circumstances. In gen - eral however, the following course will be found practicable. (2) To make a return march-past, in massed column, with guide left. After the parade has passed the reviewing stand and preferably beyond the vision of the reviewing officers, the following procedure is suggested: (See Plate No. 1.) At the street intersection nearest the point where the head of the Massed Column will rest, the Grand Marshal and Staff will drop out and take post establishing the right w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI :1 STREET PARADE 233 (head) of the massed column, facing toward the late rear.

NOTE—The following code of flag etiquette, was adopted at a mass convention, the first annual meeting of which was held in Washington, U. C., June 14, 1923 (Flag day). There were representatives present from sixty-eight National Patriotic organizations including the American Legion, American Red Cross, and experts from the Army and Navy. A permanent organization of the conference was effected. The action is of course binding upon all the civil organizations represented, and while not having gov - ernment sanction, is doubtless the most authoritative and well considered utterance ever~given on the subject. The in - structions are in accord with the fundamental rules pf Her - aldry. It should be remembered that the American Flag represents the liVing country and is itself considered a living thing. The union of the flag is the honor point, the right arm the sword arm, and therefore the point of danger an& the place of honor. K Rules 1. The Flag should be displayed only from sunrise to sunset, or between such hours as may be designated by pro - per authority. It should be displayed on National and State holidays and on historic and special occasions. The Flag should always be hoisted briskly and lowered slowly and ceremoniously. 2. When carried in a procession with another flag or flags, the Flag of the United States should be either on the marching right, i. e., the Flag’s own right, or when there is a line of other flags the Flag of the United States may be in front of the center of that line. 3. When displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, the Flag of the United States should be on the right, the Flag’s own right, and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag. 4. When a number of flags are grouped and displayed 238 DISPLAY OF THE FLAG 239 from staffs, the Flag of the United States should be in the center or at the highest point of the group. 5. When flags of States or cities or pennants of so - cieties are flown on the same halyard with the Flag of the United States, the National Flag should always be at the peak. When flown from adjacent staffs the Flag of~ the United States should be hoisted first. No flag or pennant should be placed above or to the right of the Flag of the United States. 6. When flags of two or more nations are displayed they should be flown from separate staffs of the same height and the flags should be of approximately equal size. (International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another in time of peace.) 7. When the Flag is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of building, the union of the Flag should go clear to the head of the staff unless the Flag is at half mast. 8. When the Flag of the United States is displayed in a manner other than by being flown from a staff it should be displayed flat, whether indoors or out. When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the Flag’s own right, i. e., to the observer’s left. When displayed in a window it should be displayed the same way, that is, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street. When fes - toons, rosettes or drapings of blue, white and red are de - sired, bunting should be used, but never the Flag. 9. When displayed over the middle of the street, as between buildings, the Flag of the United States should be suspended vertically with the union to the north in an east- and-west street or to the east in a north-and-south street. 10. When used on a speaker’s platform, the Flag should be displayed above and behind the speaker. It should never be used to cover the speaker’s desk nor to drape over the front of the platform. If flown from a staff it should be on the speaker’s front. 11. When used in .unveiling a statue or monument, the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichti ngargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl xv slichtiflgargus.fll xv stichtingargus.nl w.stlchtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. sttchtingargus.nI 240 DISPLAY OF THE FLAG Flag should not be allowed to fall to the ground but should be carried aloft to wave out, forming a distinctive feature during the remainder of the ceremony. 12. When flown at half mast, the Flag is first hoisted to the peak and then lowered to the half staff position,- but before lowering the Flag for the day, it is raised again to the peak. On Memorial Day, May 30, the Flag is displayed at half mast from sunrise until noon and at full staff from noon until sunset, for the Nation lives and the Flag is the symbol of the living Nation. 13. When used to cover a casket the Flag should be placed so that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder. The Flag should not be lowered into the grave nor allowed to touch the ground. The casket should be carried foot first. 14. When the Flag is displayed in church, it should be from a staff placed on the congregation’s right as they face the clergyman. The service flag, the State flag, or other flags should be at the left of the congregation. If in the chancel, the Flag of the United States should be placed on the clergyman’s right as he faces the congregation and the other flags on his left. 15. When the Flag is in such a condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display it should not be cast aside or used in any way that might be viewed as disrespectful to the National colors, but should be destroyed as a whole, pri - vately, preferably by burning or by some other method in harmony with the reverence and respect we owe to the em - blem representing our country. Cautions 1. Do not permit disrespect to be shown to the Flag of the United States. 2. Do not dip the Flag of the United States to any per - son or any thing. The regimental color, State flag, organi - zation or institutional flag will render this honor. 3. Do not display the Flag of the United States with the union down except as a signal of distress. ii DISPLAY OF THE FLAG 241 4. Do not place any other flag or pennant above or to the right of the Flag of the United States. 5. Do not let the Flag of the United States touch the ground or trail in the water. 6. Do not place any object or emblem of any kind on or above the Flag of the United States. 7. Do not use the Flag as drapery in any form what - ever. Use bunting of blue, white and red. 8. Do not fasten the Flag in such manner as will per - mit it to be easily torn. 9. Do not drape the Flag over the hood, top, sides or back of a vehicle, or of a railroad train or boat. When the Flag is displayed on a motor car, the staff should be affixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the radiator cap. 10. Do not display the Flag on a floht in a parade ex - cept from a staff. 11. Do not use the Flag as a covering for a ceiling. 12. Do not use the Flag as a portion of a costume or of an athletic uniform. Do not embroider it upon cushions or handkerchiefs or imprint it on paper napkins or boxes. 13. Do not put lettering of any kind upon the Flag. - 14. Do not use the Flag in any form of advertisement nor fasten an advertising sign to a pole from which the Flag of the United States is flying. Proper Use of Bunting Bunting of the National colors should be used for cover - ing a speaker’s desk, draping over the front of a platform and for decoration in general. Bunting should be arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle and the red below. Salute to the Flag During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the Flag or when the Flag is passing to a parade or in a review all persons present should face the Flag, stand at attention and"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichti ngargus.nt w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichiingargus.nl xv ‘~lichtingargus.n1 xv slichtingargus.nl xv stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.srichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI xv stichtingargus.nI xv stichtingargus.nI 242 DISPLAY OF THE FLAG salute. Sir Knights not in ranks should remove the headdress with the left hand and hold it at the right shoulder. Women should salute by placing the right hand over the heart. The salute to the Flag in the moving column is rendered at the moment the Flag passes.
