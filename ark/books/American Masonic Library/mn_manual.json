These ceremonies are derived from the Constitution, the General Regulations, Masonic usages and customs, and the decisions of the Board of Custodians. While this chapter is fairly complete regarding the opening and closing of a Lodge, there are particular situations where one must refer to the Masonic Code of Minnesota for full information. To conduct these ceremonies with propriety ought to be the peculiar study of every Mason, especially of those who have the honor to rule in our assemblies. To persons who are thus dignified, every eye is naturally directed for propriety of conduct and behavior; and from them other brethren who are less informed will naturally expect to derive an example worthy of imitation. From a share in this ceremony no Mason can be exempted. It is a general concern in which all must assist. This is the first request of the Master and the prelude to all business. When the brethren assemble prior to opening the Lodge, friendly intercourse and social enjoyment are entirely proper. Boisterous and unseemly or undignified conduct are to be avoided. When the hour for opening has arrived, the Master will take his station and congregate his Lodge. The successful Master will always open his Lodge promptly at the prescribed hour. The Charter of the Lodge, either displayed or in a protective case, must be present in order to open the Lodge. The brethren, properly clothed, will take their seats, and all the officers repair to their respective stations and places. (The apron is always worn on the outside of all clothing, including overcoats.) Care is then taken to see that no person not a member is allowed to 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"remain unless properly vouched for. The Lodge is then tyled, so that none may pass in or out,â€”except those who are entitled. At Stated Communications, the Lodge is opened on any degree, at the Worshipful Master's will and pleasure. In any case, at least seven members of the Lodge must be present to transact business. The opening of the Lodge on the third degree does not open it on the first or second, so, if a candidate is to be examined, initiated, or passed at a Stated Communication, the lodge must have been opened on the first or second degree or the Master Mason's Lodge must be called from labor to refreshment. Then, at the discretion of the Master, the Lodge may be either opened or called from refreshment to labor on the first or second degree. After completing such work, the Lodge on the lower degree may then be either called from labor to refreshment or closed in form. The Lodge is then called from refreshment to labor on the third degree and duly closed. The closing of the Lodge on a higher degree does close it in the degree or degrees below it. At a Special Communication for work, the Lodge, for instance, may be opened on the first degree, the candidate examined, called from labor to refreshment, opened on the second degree, the candidate passed, and the Lodge closed or another candidate examined, called from labor to refreshment, opened on the third degree, and the candidate raised, and the Lodge closed. The closing in the highest degree closes the one or both below it. STATED AND SPECIAL COMMUNICATIONS A Lodge meeting is termed a \"Communication.\" There are two types of Communications, \"Stated\" and \"Special.\" All Stated Communications are the meetings held at the regular times specified in the Lodge By-Laws and are for the purpose of conducting the business of the Lodge. Lodge business includes the programs and events called at the will and pleasure of the Master of the Lodge and other 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"actions such as paying bills, balloting on petitions, elections, voting on motions, etc. A Stated Communication may be opened on any degree at the discretion of the Master of the Lodge and seven Master Masons must be present. All Masons who have attained the degree upon which the lodge was opened may be present, including Entered Apprentices and Fellowcrafts, and shall have voice, but only those who have attained the degree of Master Mason shall be considered members and have a vote in the business of the Lodge. (The Grand Master may grant dispensation for a Stated Communication to be held with less than a quorum for a specific purpose.) Visitors from other Lodges can not be counted for the quorum at a Stated Communication. If neither the Master nor the Wardens are present, then any Past Master of the Lodge may open and preside at a Stated Communication. Special Communications are meetings called by the Master for the purpose of examining candidates, conferring degrees, conducting Masonic funerals, or participating in Masonic ceremonies. Candidate examinations and degree work are always done at Communications that are opened (or called from refreshment to labor) on the proper degree. All other Special Comm. are opened on the Master Mason degree. A quorum for a Special Communication is seven Master Masons, and visitors can be counted in this case. If degree work is to be done during a Special Communication, then either the Master or one of the Wardens must be present (though they are not required to take part). Special dispensation from the Grand Master is needed to confer a degree without the Master or Wardens. All work started at a Communication must be completed at that same Communication, unless special dispensation is obtained from the Grand Master to hold a second Communication on the same day. Thus, all the work of a degree, including the lectures and charges, must be completed during the Communication at which the work was started or during a second, Special Communication held on the same day. There are exceptions, in three special 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"cases it is possible to hold a second Communication on the same day without dispensation from the Grand Master. This can be done if the second Communication is for examining candidates, conducting a Lodge of Sorrow, or conducting a Masonic funeral service. The officer entitled to preside may allow any qualified Master Mason to preside and to confer degrees in his presence. He may also call upon any qualified Master Mason to fill the station or place of an absent officer. No Lodge Communication can be held on Sunday except: 1. A Masonic funeral service. 2. An open and public installation or reception. THE TYLER'S DOOR Except as specified for degree work, all Brothers enter and leave the Lodge room by way of the Tyler's door. This door is guarded by the Tyler without and the Junior Deacon within the Lodge room. From the first sound of the gavel at opening to the last sound of the gavel at closing, passage through this door is governed by definite rules and conventions. These can be understood easily by assuming that the Tyler's door is locked immediately after the Lodge has been purged and that the Tyler has the only key. Once the door has been locked, it can only be opened by the Tyler at the direction of the Junior Deacon. The Junior Deacon informs the Tyler by knocks and the Tyler responds by opening the door. Should the Tyler desire to open the door to admit a Brother or to convey a message, he gives an alarm and waits for the Junior Deacon's response. There are a number of rules that determine how the Junior Deacon will respond to an alarm from the Tyler. No one is permitted to enter or leave the Lodge during the opening and closing ceremonies, and the Tyler should not give alarms during these times. Until the Lodge is duly opened no alarms are given at the door. When the Lodge is at labor, the Junior Deacon will not respond to alarms while 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the Lodge is called up. At other times the Junior Deacon will respond to an alarm after referring it to the Worshipful Master at a convenient time. During degree work or by specific order from the Worshipful Master, alarms are referred to the Senior Warden. The only exception to these rules is during the second section of the Master Mason degree when only the alarm specified in the ritual is given. SALUTES Every Mason should be carefully taught the salutes in each degree, and all salutes should be given with precision. No salutes are given until after the S.D. has lit the three burning tapers and opened the Great Lights. He then gives the first salute in Lodge. MANUAL OF THE ROD The rods are carried by the Deacons and Stewards as emblems of Office. They are carried in the performance of official duties, either directed or implied, from the sound of the gavel which congregates the Lodge to the sound of the gavel which closes the Lodge. (When the Deacons or Stewards rise as members of the Lodge, they do not pick up their rods.) Rods are usually carried in the right hand but may be carried in the left hand when occasion requires. Rods must always be held when addressing the Worshipful Master or other officer. While the Deacons or Stewards are standing, they hold the rod in a perpendicular position, resting it on the floor, in front of the shoulder; the hand grasping the rod so that the forearm is horizontal. While they are marching, they carry the rod between the upper arm and the body, inclining it forward at an angle of 23 and one-half degrees, grasping the rod at the same position as while standing. The Senior Deacon does not carry the rod during the 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"second section of the Master Mason degree nor when he carries the ballot box. When his duties require the use of both hands, he may place the rod on the floor, or in a holder, or give it to an assistant. The Stewards' rods are always in the same room as the Stewards. When giving the interrogatories on the First Degree, the Stewards hold their rods grounded. ORDER OF BUSINESS Subject to the By-Laws of the Lodge and the will and pleasure of the Master, the suggested order of business at Stated Communications is as follows: a. Ritualistic opening and pledge of allegiance b. Greetings and announcements by the Master c. Introductions of visiting brothers - Senior Deacon d. Community and social events - Junior Warden e. Opportunities for relief and assistance - Senior Warden f. Program of Masonic Instruction - Lodge Education Officer g. Final comments and closing Balloting, committee reports and other required business matters may be inserted at the Worshipful Master's will and pleasure. APRONS The apron is always worn by all Masons present at Lodge meetings. It is also worn during certain public functions for which the Lodge has been opened in private, such as Masonic funerals, public installations and certain Grand Lodge ceremonies. The apron is worn on the outside of all clothing, including overcoats. The apron is never worn under another garment. Any Master Mason should gently remind his lesser informed Brother of this fact. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PRAYER AT OPENING Most holy and glorious Lord God, the great Architect of the Universe, the Giver of all good gifts and graces!

Remember that around this altar you have promised to befriend and relieve every brother who shall need your assistance. Remember that you have promised to remind him, in the most tender manner, of his failings, and aid his reformation; to vindicate his character when wrongfully traduced; suggest, in his behalf, the most candid and favorable circumstances. Is he justly reprehended? Let the world observe how Masons love one another. These generous principles are to extend further. Every human being has a claim upon your kind offices. Do good unto all.

BENEDICTION AT CLOSING May the blessing of Heaven rest upon us and all regular Masons! May brotherly love prevail, and every moral and social virtue cement us! MASONRY AND RELIGION Masonry does not profess to be a religion, although it is obviously religious in character. It also does not pretend to take the place of religion, nor serve as a substitute for the religious beliefs of its members. Freemasonry will open its doors to all men regardless of their religious conviction, the essential requirements in this regard being an avowed belief in God and expected punishment for vice and reward for virtue. (See the first Ancient Landmark in the Grand Lodge Constitution, Section C2.03 (1) That belief in the Supreme Being, \"The Great Architect of the Universe,\" who will punish vice and reward virtue, is an indispensable prerequisite to admission to Masonry.) MINNESOTAâ€™S OFFICIAL POSITION The National Masonic Information Center proposes the following statement concerning Freemasonry and religion and is encouraging Grand Lodges throughout the 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"United States to adopt this statement so that they will have a common position regarding this religious issue. The Grand Lodge A.F. & A.M. of Minnesota adopted the following statement as a standing resolution at its 1996 Annual Communication: Basic Principles Freemasonry is not a religion, nor is it a substitute for religion. Freemasonry requires of its members belief in God as part of the obligation of every responsible adult, but advocates no sectarian faith or practice. Masonic ceremonies include prayers, both traditional and extempore, to reaffirm each individual's dependence on God and to seek divine guidance. Freemasonry is open to men of any faith, but religion may not be discussed at Masonic meetings. The Supreme Being Masons believe that there is one God and that people employ many different ways to seek and to express what they know of God. Masons primarily uses the appellation, \"Grand Architect of the Universe,\" and other non-sectarian titles, to address Deity. In this way, persons of different faiths may join together in prayer, concentrating on God rather than on differences among themselves. Masonry believes in religious freedom and that the relationship between the individual and God is personal, private, and sacred. Volume of the Sacred Law An open volume of the Sacred Law, \"the rule and guide of life,\" is an essential part of every Masonic meeting. The Volume of the Sacred Law to a Christian is the Bible; to Freemasons of other faiths, it is the book held holy by them. The Oath of Freemasonry The obligations taken by Freemasons are sworn on the Volume of the Sacred Law. They are undertakings to follow the principles of Freemasonry and to keep confidential a Freemason's means of recognition. The much-discussed penalties are judicial remnants from an earlier era and are symbolic, not literal. They refer only to the pain any honest man should feel at the thought of violating his word. Freemasonry Compared with Religion 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Freemasonry lacks the basic elements of religion: (a) It has no dogma or theology, no wish or means to enforce religious orthodoxy. (b) It offers no sacraments. (c) It does not claim to lead to salvation by works, by secret knowledge, or by any other means. The secrets of Freemasonry are concerned with modes of recognition, not with the means of salvation. Freemasonry Supports Religion Freemasonry is far from indifferent toward religion. Without interfering in religious practice, it expects each member to follow his own faith and to place his Duty to God above all other duties. Its moral teachings are acceptable to all religions. Concerning Prayer Masonic custom dictates that the Lodge be opened and closed with prayer. It is always proper to address the Supreme Being as \"The Great Architect of the Universe.\" Addressing the Deity in prayer at Masonic functions should never be done in a way that excludes Brothers of other faiths and of necessity should be inclusive and universal, not sectarian or denominational. Display of Flags Every Masonic Lodge should have the American flag displayed to the right of the Masterâ€™s podium in the East and the other national flags or the Minnesota Masonic flag displayed to the left. It is never proper to display the flag of any religious group or faith tradition in a Masonic Lodge when conducting Stated or Special Communications. The Volume of Sacred Law An open volume of Sacred Law (Holy Bible) which includes the Old and New Testaments shall be displayed upon the altar at all Stated and Special Communications. When Brothers of other faith traditions who have taken their vows on a different Volume of Sacred Law are present, it is proper and salutary to display on the altar the Volume of Sacred Law which they honor and revere. This 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"practice conforms to the highest ideals of our Craft in respect for the various faith traditions of our members when in Lodge assembled. The vows of the candidate's initiation must be taken upon the Volume of Sacred Law that will bind them to the solemn obligations of our Fraternity. Each candidate for Masonic initiation should be asked, prior to the first degree, what Volume of Sacred Law they revere as their Great Light in Masonry. If a candidate desires to provide a Volume of Sacred Law other than the Lodgeâ€™s, he may do so and his obligations can be taken upon that book. Separate books can be used for each candidate. POINTS OF INFORMATION When the Lodge is at labor, only the Three Great Lights may be upon the altar, except that during the conferring of degrees the candidates may place their hands upon the altar. Either hand may be used when voting. The lectures are part of the degrees and must not be omitted.

His petition, (if he is otherwise eligible) may be received, if it is accompanied by an amount not less than one-third of the whole fee for degrees, and if it is recommended by at least two brethren, one of whom must be a member of the Lodge being petitioned. Blank petitions for the degrees should never be handed out to non-Masons. In accordance with the principles and the Ancient Landmarks of Masonry, every petition for membership shall be received and acted on without regard to the race, color, creed, or national origin of the petitioner. Petitions when properly filled out should be filed with the Secretary of the Lodge and read by him at the first Stated Communication thereafter. If the petitioner appears from such petition to be eligible as to age and territorial jurisdiction, it may be received and referred to three brethren of the Lodge as a committee to investigate the statements in the petition, and particularly as to territorial jurisdiction and the moral, intellectual, social, and physical qualifications of the petitioner. The names of the committeemen are not to be recorded in the minutes or elsewhere. Each member of the committee will act independently in making his investigation, and no one, except the Master and the Secretary, will know who the committeemen are. A report should be made by each, if practicable, by the next Stated Communication after their appointment. A request for further time should be made by a committeeman desiring it through the Master or Secretary in case it is necessary to complete the investigation and may then be granted. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The law requires a full written report by each committeeman upon a proper blank which he will receive from the Secretary. The Lodge may accept by vote the reports of a majority of the committee or may insist upon a report from all. When a report has been so made or accepted, the report of each member of the committee is separately read (omitting his name.) If the Lodge has territorial jurisdiction of the petitioner and he is eligible as to length of residence, the ballot will be spread immediately and without discussion, whether the report is favorable or unfavorable, except that in case of the unanimous favorable report, a petitioner may be allowed to withdraw his petition without ballot by the unanimous vote of the Lodge. If the reports show lack of territorial jurisdiction or insufficient residence, the petition, with the fee, must be returned without vote or ballot. The reports of the committee are to be destroyed immediately after the ballot. METHOD OF BALLOTING The Master orders: \"Brother Senior Deacon, prepare the ballot-box.\" Senior Deacon proceeds to do so. Master, or Secretary, reads the petition. (Once a petitioner's name is read, no one can leave or enter the Lodge room until the ballot is completed.) Master, or Secretary, reads the reports of the Committee. Master announces: \"Brethren, you are about to vote on the petition for Degrees (Affiliation) (Restoration) (Reinstatement) of Mr., (Brother) . Be careful of your ballot and see that no mistakes occur. White balls elect, black balls or cubes reject.\" Senior Deacon then presents the ballot-box to Master who examines it and, if found in order, Master votes. Senior Deacon then proceeds to Senior Warden by way of the North and Senior Warden votes; then to Junior Warden; then to East, south of Master; and proceeds by 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"way of the South, each member rising and voting in turn, (every member present must vote), completing the circuit in East, to north of Master.

Senior Deacon then proceeds without order to Junior Warden's Station and presents the ballot-box to that Officer for examination; proceeding immediately to Senior Warden's Station for examination by that Officer. While Senior Deacon is proceeding South to West, Master asks: \"How stands the ballot in the South, Brother Junior Warden?\" Junior Warden, saluting, reports: \"Clear (or dark) in the South, Worshipful Master.\" While Senior Deacon is proceeding to East, Master asks: \"How stands the ballot in the West, Brother Senior Warden?\" Senior Warden, saluting, reports: \"Clear (or dark) in the West, Worshipful Master.\" Senior Deacon, by then having arrived at Worshipful Master's Station, presents ballot-box to Master, who examines it; and having first destroyed ballot, says, \"Clear (or dark) in the East. I therefore declare Mr.  elected to receive the Degrees as conferred by  Lodge; or, Brother elected to membership in  Lodge; or Broth-  er  restored to membership in Lodge.\" Confirms with gavel. If the ballot is dark, Master says: \"I therefore declare the petition of Mr. (Brother)  rejected.\" Confirms with gavel. If the ballot taken contains but one black ballot, the Master, in his discretion, may order one other ballot taken immediately,â€”to assure himself that no mistake has occurred,â€”not otherwise, and no more.

Psalm CXXXIII â€¢ Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! â€¢ It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments. â€¢ As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. Instead of scripture reading, the following paraphrase of same may be sung: Air: Auld Lang Syne (Music printed in Chapter XV with traditional words) Behold! how pleasant and how good, For brethren such as we, Of the accepted brotherhood, To dwell in unity! 'Tis like the oil on Aaron's head, Which to his feet distills; Like Hermon's dew so richly shed On Zion's sacred hills. For there the Lord of light and love A blessing sent with power: Oh, may we all this blessing prove, E'en life forevermore. On friendship's altar, rising here, Our hands now plighted be, To live in love, with hearts sincere, In peace and unity. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"It is a duty incumbent on every Master of a Lodge before the ceremony of initiation takes place, to inform the candidate of the purpose and design of the Institution; to explain the nature of his solemn engagements; and, in a manner peculiar to Masons alone, to require his cheerful acquiescence to the duties of morality and virtue and all the sacred tenets of the Fraternity. Towards the close of the first section is explained that peculiar ensign of Masonry, the LAMBSKIN, or white leather apron, which is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason; more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle, more honorable than the Star and Garter, or any other Order that could be conferred upon the candidate at the time of his initiation or at any time thereafter, by king, prince, potentate, or any other person, except he be a Mason, and which every Mason ought to wear with equal pleasure to himself and honor to the Fraternity. This is followed by an explanation of the working tools and implements of an Entered Apprentice, which are the Twenty-four inch Gauge, and the Common Gavel. The TWENTY-FOUR INCH GAUGE is an instrument made use of by Operative Masons, to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother; eight hours for our usual avocations; and eight for refreshment and sleep. The COMMON GAVEL is an instrument made use of by operative Masons, to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder's use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our minds and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life; thereby fitting our bodies, as living stones, for that spiritual building, 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. CHARGE AT INITIATION BROTHER, as you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this Ancient and Honorable Fraternity; ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial; and honorable, as tending, in every particular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better principle, or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down, than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men in all ages have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory from their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties, which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To GOD, in never mentioning His name, but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to esteem him as the chief good; to your NEIGHBOR, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you; and to YOURSELF, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the State, you are to be a quiet and peaceful subject, true to your government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity, or influence you to be guilty 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"of a dishonorable action. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations; for these are on no account to be neglected, neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be ready to receive instruction. Finally: keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the Fraternity, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly attentive not to recommend him, unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the Institution may be firmly established and the world at large convinced of its good effects. SECOND SECTION The second section rationally accounts for the origin of our hieroglyphical instruction, and convinces us of the advantages which will ever accompany a faithful observance of our duty; it maintains, beyond the power of contradiction, the propriety of our rites, while it demonstrates to the most skeptical and hesitating mind, their excellence and utility; it illustrates, at the same time, certain particulars, of which our ignorance might lead us into error, and which, as Masons, we are indispensably bound to know. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE BADGE OF A MASON Every candidate, at his initiation, is presented with a Lambskin, or white leather apron. The LAMB has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence; he, therefore, who wears the lambskin as a badge of Masonry is thereby continually reminded of that purity of life and conduct, which is essentially necessary to his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. From east to west Freemasonry extends, and between the north and south in every clime and nation, are Masons to be found. Our Institution is said to be supported, by WISDOM, STRENGTH and BEAUTY; because it is necessary there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support and beauty to adorn, all great and important undertakings. Its dimensions are unlimited, and its covering no less than the canopy of heaven. To this object the Mason's mind is continually directed, and thither he hopes at last to arrive by the aid of the theological ladder, which Jacob, in his vision, saw ascending from earth to heaven; the three principal rounds of which are denominated FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY, and which admonish us to have faith in God, hope in immortality, and charity to all mankind. Every well governed lodge is furnished with the HOLY BIBLE, SQUARE and COMPASS. The BIBLE points out the path that leads to happiness, and is dedicated to God; the SQUARE teaches us to regulate our conduct by the principles of morality and virtue and is dedicated to the Master; the COMPASS teaches us to limit our desires in every station, and is dedicated to the Craft. The BIBLE is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ , the SQUARE to the Master, because, being the proper Masonic emblem 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"of his office, it is constantly to remind him of the duty he owes to the Lodge over which he is appointed to preside, and the COMPASS to the Craft, because by a due attention to its use, they are taught to regulate their desires and keep their passions within due bounds. The ornamental parts of a Lodge, displayed in this section, are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The MOSAIC PAVEMENT is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon's Temple; the INDENTED TESSEL, that beautiful tessellated border, or skirting which surrounded it, and the BLAZING STAR, in the center, is commemorative of the star which appeared to guide the wise men of the east to the place of our Savior's nativity. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematic of human life, checkered with good and evil; the beautiful border which surrounds it, those blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. The movable and immovable jewels also claim our attention in this section. The ROUGH ASHLAR is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The PERFECT ASHLAR is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adjusted by the tools of the Fellow Craft. The TRESTLE BOARD is for the Master Workman to draw his designs upon. By the ROUGH ASHLAR, we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the PERFECT ASHLAR, that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive, by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the TRESTLE BOARD, we are reminded that as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his Trestle Board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the Book of Life, which is our spiritual Trestle Board. Our ancient brethren dedicated their Lodges to King Solomon. Masons professing Christianity dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist, who were eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time there is represented in every regular and well-governed Lodge, a certain Point within a Circle; the Point representing an individual brother, the Circle representing the boundary line of his duty to God and man, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, prejudices or interests to betray him on any occasion. This Circle is embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were perfect parallels, in Christianity as well as Masonry; and upon the vertex rests the Book of Holy Scriptures which point out the whole duty of man. In going round this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially err. OF BROTHERLY LOVE BROTHERLY LOVE, RELIEF AND TRUTH are themes on which we here expatiate. By the exercise of BROTHERLY LOVE, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family, the high and low, the rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support and protect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"OF RELIEF To RELIEVE the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men; but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships, and establish our connections. OF TRUTH TRUTH is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true, is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other's welfare, and rejoicing in each other's prosperity. To this illustration succeeds an explanation of the four cardinal virtuesâ€”Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice. OF TEMPERANCE TEMPERANCE is that due restraint upon our affections and passions, which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or contracting any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence of which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequently subject him to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"OF FORTITUDE FORTITUDE is that noble and steady purpose of the mind, whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril or danger, when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice; and, like the former, should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every Mason, as a safeguard or security against any illegal attack that may be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from him any of those secrets with which he has been so solemnly intrusted, and which was emblematically represented upon his first admission into the lodge, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ OF PRUDENCE PRUDENCE teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge and prudentially determine, on all things relative to our present. as well as to our future happiness. This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token or word, whereby the secrets of Masonry might be unlawfully obtained, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ OF JUSTICE JUSTICE is that standard, or boundary, of right, which enables us to render to every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and, as Justice in a great measure constitutes the real good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate from the minutest principles thereof, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE SECRETS OF MASONRY Every Entered Apprentice should be informed of the following basic principles and information. What You Can Discuss With a Non-Mason Masonry is not a secret society. Members of our lodges are not in anyway forbidden from telling others that they are Masons. While every Mason should remember his obligations to secrecy, yet we want to inform non-masons about who we are, what we are, and what we do. Therefore it is important that every Mason understand clearly which things he can talk about and which things he cannot. What is a Masonic Secret What are the things we call the secrets of Masonry? The first secret is the ballot of a Mason. No one can know how a Mason votes, unless that Mason tells him, and that is considered unmasonic conduct. The right and privilege of casting a secret ballot is universally respected in this country by Masons and non-masons alike. Other secrets are: â€¢ the modes of recognition (signs and words); â€¢ the obligations or vows of each degree; â€¢ the manner of conferring the degrees, and; â€¢ the legend of the third degree. These four items are usually considered to be the \"real\" Masonic secrets. But we should all realize that any interested party can go to the public library or bookstore and obtain books which reveal all these things. Clearly we cannot consider these to be secrets in the true sense of the word. There is no way we can keep these books from the public. What then is the meaning of our obligation to secrecy? Our Obligation to Secrecy The obligations of Masonry, as well as all other teachings and laws of our Craft, are not things that Masons 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"impose upon other people. These obligations, teachings, and laws are things that each Mason agrees to accept for himself and to apply to himself. Thus when we agree to keep a Masonic secret we only agree that we will not discuss that matter with a non-mason. This agreement is then binding upon the Mason, but it is not and cannot be binding upon a non-mason. Masons should not be disturbed by this. If a non- mason learns what he considers to be our secrets, we are under no obligation to take action of any kind. But if the same person comes to us and asks us to affirm or deny that certain things are our secrets, then we must neither confirm nor deny what they have learned. We are best advised to simply change the subject. If that fails, then let the person read this page. 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV SECOND DEGREE Masonry is a progressive science, and is divided into different classes or degrees, for the more regular advancement in the knowledge of its mysteries. According to the progress we make, we limit or extend our inquiries; and in proportion to our capacity, we attain to a less or greater degree of perfection. Masonry includes within its circle almost every branch of polite learning. Under the veil of its mysteries is comprehended a regular system of science. Many of its illustrations, to the confined genius, may appear unimportant; but the man of more enlarged faculties will perceive them to be in the highest degree, useful and interesting. The first degree is well calculated to enforce the duties of morality, and imprint on the memory the noblest principles which can adorn the human mind. It is, therefore, the best introduction to the second degree, which not only extends the same plan, but comprehends a more diffusive system of knowledge. Here practice and theory join, in qualifying the industrious Mason to share the pleasures which an advancement in the art must necessarily afford. Listening with attention to the wise opinions of experienced Craftsmen on important subjects, he gradually familiarizes his mind to useful instruction, and is soon enabled to investigate truths of the utmost concern in the general transactions of life. FIRST SECTION A knowledge of the work of this degree is absolutely necessary for all Craftsmen, and as the work contains the Ceremony of Passing and many other important particulars, no officer or member of a Lodge should be unacquainted with it. Here he is entrusted with particular tests, to enable him 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"to prove his title to the privileges of this degree, while satisfactory reasons are given for their origin. Many duties, which cement in the firmest union well informed brethren, are illustrated in this section; and an opportunity is given to make such advances in Masonry, as will always distinguish the abilities of those who have arrived at preferment. Amos VII, 7, 8 â€¢ Thus he showed me: â€¢ and behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb- line, â€¢ with a plumb-line in his hand. â€¢ â€¢ And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, a plumb-line. â€¢ â€¢ Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people, Israel: â€¢ â€¢ I will not again pass by them any more.

(See Chapter XV for music and words) His laws inspire our being Our light is from his Sun; Beneath the Eye All-seeing Our Mason's work is done. His plumb-line, in uprightness, Our faithful guide shall be, And in the Source of brightness Our willing eyes shall see.

Within thy chamber name him A workman wise and trueâ€” While loving Crafts shall claim him In bonds of friendship due; Thus shall these walls extol thee, And future ages prove What Masons joy to call theeâ€” The God of Truth and Love. The Plumb, Square, and Level, those noble and useful implements of a Fellow Craft, are here introduced and moralized, and serve as a constant admonition to the practice of virtue and morality. The PLUMB is an instrument made use of by Operative Masons, to raise perpendiculars, the SQUARE, to square their work, and the LEVEL, to lay horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes. The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations before God and man, squaring our actions by the Square of virtue, and remembering that we are traveling upon the Level of time, to \"that undiscovered country, from whose bourn no traveler returns.\" The second part of the work of this degree has recourse to the origin of the Institution, and views Masonry under two denominations, operative and speculative. These are separately considered, and the principles on which both are founded, particularly explained. Their affinity is pointed out by allegorical figures, and typical representations. The period stipulated for rewarding merit is fixed, and the inimitable moral to which that circumstance alludes is explained. The creation of the world is described, and many particulars recited, all of which have been carefully preserved among Masons, and transmitted from one age to another, by oral tradition. Circumstances of great importance to the Fraternity are here particularized and many traditional tenets and customs confirmed by sacred 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and profane record. The celestial and terrestrial globes are considered; and here the accomplished gentleman may display his talents to advantage in the elucidation of the Orders of Architecture, the Senses of human nature, and the liberal Arts and Sciences, which are severally classed in a regular arrangement. In short, the section contains a store of valuable knowledge, founded on reason and sacred record, both entertaining and instructive. Masonry is considered under two denominations: Operative and Speculative. OPERATIVE MASONRY By OPERATIVE MASONRY we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion, and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings, and convenient shelter from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice, as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. SPECULATIVE MASONRY By SPECULATIVE MASONRY, we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion, as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of the creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ In six days God created the heavens and the earth, and rested upon the seventh day. The seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of the creation, and to adore their great Creator. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ The doctrine of the spheres is included in the science of astronomy, and particularly considered in this section. OF THE GLOBES The GLOBES are two artificial spherical bodies on the convex surface of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other particulars. The Sphere, with the parts of the earth delineated on its surface, is called the Terrestrial Globe; and that with the constellations, and other heavenly bodies, the Celestial Globe. The principal use of the globes, besides serving as maps to distinguish the outward parts of the earth, and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and explain the phenomena arising from the annual revolution, and the diurnal rotation, of the earth round its own axis. They are the noblest instruments for improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or proposition, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and His Works, and are induced to encourage the studies of astronomy, geography, navigation, and the arts dependent on them, by which society has been so much benefited. OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE The orders of architecture come under consideration in this section; a brief description of them may therefore not be improper. By order in architecture, is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns, and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole. 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"OF ITS ANTIQUITY From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at the top and bottom, are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. The TUSCAN is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derived its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. The DORIC, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high; and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, except mouldings; though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state. In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric; for when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in its original state. 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The IONIC bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the Ionians, as the famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young woman, of an elegant shape, dressed in her hair, as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man. The CORINTHIAN, the richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves, and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentils and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth, by Callimachus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the following remarkable circumstance: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys, covered with a tile, placed over an acanthus root, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encompassed the basket, till, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction, and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with the object, set about imitating the figure; the vase of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus the tile; and the volutes the bending leaves. The COMPOSITE is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has the quarterround as the Tuscan and Doric order, is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentils or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"OF THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE The ancient and original orders of architecture, revered by Masons, are no more than three, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric; and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally; the Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in architecture. OF THE FIVE SENSES OF HUMAN NATURE An analysis of the human faculties is next given in this section, in which the five external senses of human nature particularly claim attention. These are Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. HEARING is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires; while thus our reason is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge by the information of others. For these purposes we are endowed with hearing, that, by a proper exertion of our natural powers, our happiness may be complete. SEEING is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of time, without change of place or 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"situation view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of nature. By this sense we find our way in the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more: by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections, of our fellow creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance would display hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which administer to this sense, are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye, and its appurtenances, evinces the admirable contrivance of nature for performing all its various external and internal motions; while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals suited to their several ways of life, clearly demonstrates this organ to be the masterpiece of nature's work. FEELING is that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of bodies; such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion and extension. These three senses,â€”Hearing, Seeing, and Feeling, â€”are deemed peculiarly essential among Masons. SMELLING is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and indeed most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of vast subtlety, as well in the state of life and growth as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effluvia, being drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all bodies are smelled. Hence it is evident, that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator's having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal, through which 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the air continually passes in respiration. TASTING enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by it we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. Smelling and tasting are inseparably connected, and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices. On the mind all our knowledge must depend; what, therefore, can be a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons? By anatomical dissection and observation, we become acquainted with the body; but it is by the anatomy of the mind alone we discover its powers and principles. To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God's bounty to man, we shall add, that memory, imagination, taste, reasoning, moral perception, and all the active powers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field for philosophical disquisition, which far exceed human inquiry, and are peculiar mysteries, known only to nature, and to nature's God, to whom we are all indebted for creation, preservation and every blessing we enjoy. OF THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES The seven liberal Arts and Sciences, Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy, are next illustrated in this section; it may not, therefore, be improper to insert here a short explanation of them. GRAMMAR teaches the proper arrangement of words, according to the idiom or dialect of any particular 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"people; and that excellency of pronunciation, which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeably to reason and correct usage. RHETORIC teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with propriety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance; wisely contriving to captivate the hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat and exhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC teaches us to guide our reason discretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce, and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted, or granted; and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning, and disposing; all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally determined. ARITHMETIC teaches the powers and properties of numbers, which is variously effected by letters, tables, figures and instruments. By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given, for finding out any certain number, whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. GEOMETRY treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered, from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure; or an indivisible part of space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely length, breadth and thickness. By this science, the architect is enabled to construct his plans, and execute his designs; the general to arrange his soldiers; the engineer to mark out ground for encampments; the geographer to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms and 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations and to fix the durations of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, geometry is the foundation of architecture, and the root of the mathematics. MUSIC teaches the art of forming concords, so as compose delightful harmony, by a mathematical and proportional arrangement of acute, grave and mixed sounds. This art, by a series of experiments, is reduced to a demonstrative science, with respect to tones, and the intervals of sound. It inquires into the nature of concords and discords, and enables us to find out the proportion between them by numbers. ASTRONOMY is that divine art, by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the Almighty Creator, in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere. Assisted by astronomy, we can observe the motions, measure the distances, comprehend the magnitudes, and calculate the periods and eclipses, of the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globes, the system of the world, and the preliminary law of nature. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive unparalleled instances of wisdom and goodness, and, through the whole creation, trace the glorious Author by his works. OF THE MORAL ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY From this theme we proceed to illustrate the moral advantages of Geometry, a subject on which the following observations may not be unacceptable GEOMETRY, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Masonry is erected. By geometry, we may curiously trace nature, through her various windings, to her most concealed recesses, By it, we discover the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their different orbits and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observations of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the Divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans, which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Masonry are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. Tools and implements of architecture are selected by the Fraternity, to imprint on the memory wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, are transmitted unimpaired, the excellent tenets of our Institution. 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHARGE AT PASSING BROTHER, being advanced to the second degree of Masonry, we congratulate you on your preferment. The internal, and not the external qualifications of a man, are what Masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Mason, you are bound to discharge; or enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support; and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate, or aggravate, the offenses of your brethren; but, in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration; especially the science of geometry, which is established as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the wonderful properties of nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new character it is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Fraternity, by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagements as a Fellow Craft, and to these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties. SECOND SECTION The second section of the degree consists of a lecture in two parts. (Second Section of the Fellowcraft Degree Lecture was made an optional lecture by vote of Grand Lodge Assembly in 1997) 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V THIRD DEGREE From this class the rulers of regular Bodies of Ancient Craft Masonry are selected; as it is only from those, who are capable of giving instruction, that we can properly expect to receive it. FIRST SECTION The ceremony of initiation into the third degree is contained in this section of the degree and here many other useful instructions are given. The following passage of Scripture is introduced during the ceremonies: ECCLESIASTES XII, 1-7 â€¢ Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; â€¢ while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: â€¢ in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, â€¢ â€¢ and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the streets, â€¢ â€¢ when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; â€¢ â€¢ also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Paraphrase of the above for Music. Air: Bonny Doon or Sweet Hour LMD (See Chapter XV for music and words) Let us remember in our youth, Before the evil days draw nigh, Our Great Creator, and his Truth, Ere memory fail, and pleasures fly; Or sun or moon, or planets light Grow dark, or clouds return in gloom; Ere vital spark no more incite; When strength shall bow and years consume. Let us in youth remember Him! Who formed our frame, and spirits gave Ere windows of the mind grow dim, Or door of speech obstructed wave; When voice of bird fresh terror wake, And music's daughters charm no more, Or fear to rise, with trembling shake, Along the path we travel o'er. In youth to God let memory cling, Before desire shall fail or wane Or e'er be loosed life's silver string Or bowl at fountain rent in twain; For man to his long home doth go, And mourners group around his urn! Our dust to dust again must flow, And spirits unto God return. The working tools of a Master Mason, which are illustrated in this section, are all the implements of Masonry indiscriminately, but more especially the Trowel. The TROWEL is an instrument made use of by operative Masons, to spread the cement which unites a building into one common mass; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of spreading the cement of Brotherly Love and affection, that cement which unites us into one sacred band, or society of friends and brothers, 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"among whom no contention should ever exist, but that noble contention, or rather emulation, of who best can work, or best agree. SECOND SECTION This section recites the historical traditions of the Fraternity and presents to view a finished picture of the utmost consequence to the Fraternity. It exemplifies an instance of virtue, fortitude, and integrity, seldom equaled, and never excelled, in the history of man. Air: Pleyel's Hymn (See Chapter XV for music and words) Solemn strikes the funeral chime! Notes of our departing time, As we journey here below, Through a pilgrimage of woe! Mortals, now indulge a tear, For mortality is here! See how wide her trophies wave, O'er the slumbers of the grave! Here another guest we bring, Seraphs of celestial wing, To our funeral altar come, Waft a friend and brother home. Lord of all! belowâ€”aboveâ€” Fill our hearts with Truth and Love. As dissolves our earthly tie, Take us to thy Lodge on high. PRAYER AT RAISING (Job xiv) Thou, O God! knowest our down-sitting and our uprising, and understandest our thought afar off. Shield and defend us from the evil intentions of our enemies, and support us under the trials and afflictions we are destined to 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"endure, while traveling through this vale of tears. Man that is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with Thee; Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish his day. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: so man lieth down, and riseth not up till the heavens shall be no more. Yet, O Lord! have compassion on the children of Thy creation, administer them comfort in time of trouble, and save them with an everlasting salvation.â€”Amen. Response: So mote it be. CHARGE AT RAISING BROTHER, your zeal for the institution of Masonry, the progress you have made in the mystery, and your conformity to our regulations, have pointed you out as a proper object of our favor and esteem. You are now bound by duty, honor and gratitude, to be faithful to your trust; to support the dignity of your character on every occasion; and to enforce, by precept and example, obedience to the tenets of the Fraternity. In the character of a Master Mason, you are authorized to correct the errors and irregularities of your uninformed brethren, and to guard them against a breach of fidelity. To preserve the reputation of the Fraternity unsullied, must be your constant care; and for this purpose it is your province to recommend to your inferiors, obedience and submission; to your equals, courtesy and affability; to your superiors, kindness and condescension. Universal benevolence you are always to inculcate; and, by the regularity of your own behavior, afford the best 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"example for the conduct of others less informed. The Ancient Landmarks, intrusted to your care, you are carefully to preserve; and never suffer them to be infringed, or countenance a deviation from the established usages and customs of the Fraternity. Your virtue, honor, and reputation, are concerned in supporting with dignity the character you now bear. Let no motive, therefore, make you swerve from your duty, violate your vows or betray your trust; but be true and faithful, and imitate the example of that celebrated artist whom you this evening represent. Thus you will render yourself deserving of the honor which we have conferred, and merit the confidence that we have reposed. THIRD SECTION This section also illustrates certain hieroglyphical emblems and inculcates many useful lessons, to extend knowledge and promote virtue. In this lecture, many particulars relative to King Solomon's Temple are considered. The construction of this grand edifice was attended with two remarkable circumstances. From Josephus we learn, that, although seven years were occupied in building it, yet during the whole term it rained not in the day time, that the workmen might not be obstructed in their labor; and from the sacred history it appears, that there was neither the sound of the hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard in the house, while it was building. This famous Temple was supported by fourteen hundred and fifty-three columns, and two thousand nine hundred and six pilasters; all hewn from the finest Parian marble. There were employed in its building, three Grand Masters; three thousand and three hundred Masters, or overseers of the work; eighty thousand Fellow-Crafts â€¢ â€¢ and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices, or bearers of burdens. All these were classed and arranged in such a manner by the wisdom of King Solomon, that neither envy, 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"discord nor confusion were suffered to interrupt that universal peace and tranquility, which pervaded the world at this important period. The THREE STEPS, usually delineated on the Master's Carpet, are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, viz.: Youth, Manhood and Age. In YOUTH, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in MANHOOD, as Fellow-Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbors, and ourselves; that so in AGE, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflections consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. The POT OF INCENSE is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity; and, as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent Author of our existence, for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. The BEE HIVE is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven, to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us, that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve them, without inconvenience to ourselves. When we take a survey of nature, we view man, in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brutal creation; he lies languishing for days, months and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent of all other beings; 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"but, as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons. The BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS, guarded by the Tyler's sword, reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry, ever bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and circumspection. The SWORD, pointing to a naked heart, demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions, may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that All-Seeing Eye, whom the Sun, Moon and Stars obey, and under whose watchful care even Comets perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. The ANCHOR AND ARK are emblems of a well- grounded hope, and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that divine ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. The FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID. This was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of priesthood, and raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. This 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry or Masonry; on this subject he drew out many problems and theorems, and among the most distinguished, he erected this, which in the joy of his heart, he called Eureka, in the Grecian language signifying, I have found it; and upon the discovery of which, he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. The HOUR-GLASS is an emblem of human life Behold! how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close. We cannot, without astonishment, behold the little particles which are contained in this machine, how they pass away almost imperceptibly, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man! Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow, blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost which nips the shoot, and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. The SCYTHE is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold! what havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race; if by chance we should escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive to the years of manhood, yet withal we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us. 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"CHAPTER Vl INSTALLATION OF LODGE OFFICERS No brother, elected or appointed to office, in a chartered Lodge can enter upon the discharge of his duties until installed. The officers of the Lodge under dispensation cannot be installed, and therefore acquire no rank by such service. The officers of a newly constituted Lodge are installed by the Grand Master or his proxy, and he may at pleasure, install the officers of any Lodge. With this exception, it is the right and duty of every Master to install, or have installed, his successor, either on the evening of election, or on or before the next stated meeting. Any Past Master, in good standing, of a chartered Lodge, is authorized to install a Master-elect. Then, assisted by a brother, usually a Past Master, acting as Marshal, the installation service proceeds. When the Master is installed, he has the right to install the other officers, except at the constitution of a new Lodge, or when the Grand Master or his proxy may officiate. He usually waives this right, and requests the brother who installed him to proceed. No officer can be installed by proxy, hence an absentee must be installed by the Master at a subsequent meeting. If an objection is made to the installation of the Master, and the Installing Officer deems the same sufficient, he postpones the services until the Grand Master decides what to do. If objection is made to any other elected brother, the installation proceeds, except as to his office. An installed officer hold his office until his successor is installed, but if re-elected, he must be re-installed. Public installations are permitted. If such public installation is held in the hall, the Lodge is formally opened on the third degree, after which the families and friends of the brethren are admitted, or the Lodge may be opened in an adjoining apartment. The exercises may be made more interesting by the use of vocal 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"and instrumental music. The following service is intended for the annual installation of Lodge officers, where the same brother officiates throughout, but may be used at any installation. It is also intended for use at the installation of the officers of a new Lodge, with such variation of language, as may be necessary to fit the occasion. If the Grand Master or other officer of high rank officiates, he will be addressed by his proper Grand or other title. The knocks of the gavel are never to be used in public. ANNUAL INSTALLATION (The Marshal will see that the officers' jewels, the Deacons' and Stewards' rods, the Tyler's sword, the Book of Constitutions, the Charter, and the Lodge By-Laws are within reach, and so arranged that he can promptly hand them to the Installing Officer when required. The INSTALLING OFFICER takes the East, and says:) Brethren of Lodge, No  , we are about to install your officers for the ensuing year. Brother Secretary, announce the names of the officers- elect. (The Secretary does so.) Installing Officer. - Brethren, you have heard the names of the officers-elect. If any of you know aught, why any of them should not be installed, let him speak now, or forever after be silent. (After waiting a few moments and hearing no objections, he proceeds:) Hearing no objection, I will proceed. Brother Marshal, present the Master-elect to the East. Marshal. - Worshipful Master, I present Brother to be installed Master of this Lodge.

Installing Officer.- My Brother, place your right hand over your heart and repeat after me your official obligation: I solemnly promise, upon the honor of a Mason, that in the office of Master of this Lodge, I will, to the best of my ability, strictly comply with the Constitution, Laws, Rules and Regulations of the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Minnesota, the By-Laws of this Lodge, and all other ancient Masonic usages, so far as the 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"same shall come to my knowledge. (The brethren are seated. The following address, preceding the fifteen charges may be used or omitted at discretion.) Installing Officer.- My Brother, you are now to be installed Master of this Lodge, with powers and prerogatives which are well nigh absolute. The interests of your Lodge, for weal or woe, will be in your keeping, during your term of office. The good resolutions, which doubtless you have formed, not to abuse or pervert these powers, I would gladly strengthen by a word of admonition. The very consciousness of the possession of a great power will ever make a generous mind cautious and gentle in its exercise. To rule has been the lot of many, and requires neither strength of intellect nor soundness of judgment; to rule well has been the fortune of but few, and may well be the object of an honorable ambition. It is not by the strong arm, or the iron will that obedience and order, the chief requisites, are secured, but by holding the key to the hearts of men. To be Master of his Lodge is an honor to which any well-informed Master Mason may laudably aspire. The office is one of great antiquity, dignity and respect, but its incumbent, to rule well, should possess and practice several important requisites. As a Man, he should be of approved integrity and irreproachable morals, free from the dominion of hasty temper and ill-governed passions; of good repute in the world, and, an example to his brethren, in practicing the cardinal virtues of Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice. As a Citizen, he should be loyal to his government, obedient to its laws, prompt in the duties he owes to society, and a pattern of fidelity in all social and domestic relations. As a Mason, he should cling to the old Landmarks, have a knowledge of the laws, language and literature of Freemasonry; be desirous to learn and apt to teach, accomplished in the work and lectures, prompt to aid and relieve, and ever mindful, that though elevated for a time 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"above his fellows, he is elevated by them, and should cultivate everywhere and at all times, the Golden Tenets of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. As an officer , he should remember, first of all, that he is an individual Mason, sharing in that respect a common lot with his brethren, and therefore be interested in the welfare of each and all. He should be neither unduly ostentatious nor overbearing. He should be accessible to all, and should cultivate the friendship and confidence of his associate officers. He should be willing to take counsel with his brethren, and ready to give it. He should be patient in investigation, deliberate in judgment, prompt in execution, forbearing with evil doers, and ready to reward good. He should be opposed to the restless spirit of innovation, watchful over the treasury, and devoid of favoritism and partiality. Such are some of the most important qualifications which a Master should possess, and the errors he should avoid. It may be that most, if not all, of us, have failed to reach this standard, but it should be your purpose to reach it, and thus be a bright and shining example to brethren who shall come after you. (The INSTALLING OFFICER then addresses him:) My Brother, previous to your investiture it is necessary that you should signify your assent to those Ancient Charges and Regulations which point out the duty of a Master of a Lodge. 1. You agree to be a good man and true, and strictly to obey the moral law. 2. You agree to be a peaceable citizen, and cheerfully to conform to the laws of the country in which you reside. 3. You promise not to be concerned in plots and conspiracies against government, but patiently to submit to the decisions of the constituted authorities 4. You agree to pay a proper respect to the civil magistrate, to work diligently, live creditably, and act honorably by all men. 5. You agree to hold in veneration the original rulers and patrons of Freemasonry, and their regular successors, 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"supreme and subordinate, according to their stations; and to submit to the awards and resolutions of your brethren when in Lodge convened, in every case consistent with the Constitutions of the Fraternity. 6. You agree to avoid private piques and quarrels, and to guard against intemperance and excess. 7. You agree to be cautious in carriage and behavior, courteous to your brethren, and faithful to your Lodge. 8. You promise to respect genuine brethren, and to discountenance impostors and all dissenters from the original plan of Masonry. 9. You agree to promote the general good of society, to cultivate the social virtues, and to propagate the knowledge of the mystic art. 10. You promise to pay homage to the Grand Master for the time being, and to his officers when duly installed; and strictly conform to every edict of the Grand Lodge, or General Assembly of Masons, that is not subversive of the principles and groundwork of Masonry. 11. You admit that it is not in the power of any man, or body of men, to make innovations in the body of Masonry. 12. You promise a regular attendance on the committees and communications of the Grand Lodge, on receiving proper notice; and to pay attention to all the duties of Masonry, on convenient occasions. 13 You admit that no new Lodge shall be formed without permission of the Grand Lodge; and that no countenance be given to any irregular Lodge or to any person clandestinely initiated therein, being contrary to the Ancient Charges of Freemasonry. 14. You admit that no person can be regularly made a Mason in, or admitted a member of, any regular Lodge, without previous notice, and due inquiry into his character. 15. You agree that no visitors shall be received into your Lodge without due examination, and producing proper vouchers of their having been initiated in a regular Lodge. These are the Regulations of Free and Accepted Masons. Do you submit to these Charges, and promise to 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"support these Regulations, as all Masters have done in all ages before you? (The Master-elect answers:) I do. My Brother, in consequence of your cheerful conformity to the Charges and Regulations of the Fraternity you are now to be installed Master of this Lodge, in full confidence of your care, skill, and capacity to govern the same. With pleasure I now invest you with this jewel of your office - the Square. As the SQUARE is employed by Operative Masons to fit and adjust the stones of a building, that all its parts may properly agree, so you, as Master of this Lodge, are admonished by the symbolic meaning of the Square to preserve that moral deportment among the members of your Lodge which should always characterize good Masons, and to exert your authority to prevent ill-feeling or angry discussion arising, to impair the harmony of its meetings. I now place in your care the furniture and implements of Masonry. The Holy Bible with the Square and Compass upon its open pages, is on the Altar, where it must always be when the Lodge is at Labor. The HOLY WRITINGS, that Great Light in Masonry, will guide you to all truth; it will direct your paths to the temple of happiness, and point out to you the whole duty of man. The SQUARE teaches us to regulate our actions by rule and line, and to harmonize our conduct by the principles of morality and virtue. The COMPASS teaches us to limit our desires in every station, that, rising to eminence by merit, we may live respected, and die regretted. The RULE directs, that we should punctually observe our duty; press forward in the path of virtue, and, neither inclining to the right nor to the left, in all our actions have eternity in view. The LINE teaches the criterion of moral rectitude, to avoid dissimulation in conversation and action, and to direct our steps to the path which leads to immortality. 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS you are to search at all times. Cause it to be read in your Lodge, that none may pretend ignorance of the excellent precepts it enjoins. You now receive in charge this CHARTER, by the authority of which this Lodge is held. Without its presence you cannot open your Lodge. You are, therefore, to preserve it carefully, and transmit it safely to your successor. You will also receive in charge the BY-LAWS of your Lodge, which you are to see carefully and punctually executed. Lastly, I place in your hand this GAVEL, the emblem of your authority. (Explains its use except in public installations. There he will say \"You have already been instructed in its use.\") Use it firmly, but not arbitrarily, to the end that peace and harmony may prevail among your brethren. I now conduct you (clasps his hand) to the oriental chair, and cover you with that distinction which, in this Lodge, it is alone your privilege to wear.

Brethren, behold your Master, and unite with me in giving him the Grand Honors. (If the ceremonies are in public, the procession will be dispensed with, and it and the Ode may be omitted if time is limited. If private, the Marshal forms a procession of the brethren, who march in single file, three times around the hall, signifying their respect and obedience by the usual distinctive signs in the several degrees; during or after which, the following Master's Installation Ode may be sung, or if preferred, the Installation Ode found in the Grand Lodge Installation service, which follows this.) 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Air: Balerma or Azmon CM (See Chapter XV for music and words to Azmon CM) Behold, O, Master in the East, What glories greet thee there; What floods of radiance earthward stream; The sun is rising fair.

For a pattern of imitation consider the great luminary of nature, which, rising in the east, regularly diffuses light and luster to all within its circle.

In short, by a diligent observance of the By-Laws of your Lodge, the Constitutions of Masonry, and, above all, the Holy Scriptures, which are given as a rule and guide to your faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with honor and reputation, and lay up a crown of rejoicing, which shall continue when time shall be no more. Brother Senior and Junior Wardens! (They rise.) You are too well acquainted with the principles of Masonry to warrant any distrust that you will be found wanting in the discharge of your respective duties. Suffice it to say that what you have seen praiseworthy in others, you should carefully imitate; and what in them may have appeared defective, you should in yourselves amend. You should be examples of good order and regularity; for it is only by a due regard to the laws, in your own conduct, that you can expect obedience to them from others. You are assiduously to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust, - diffusing light and imparting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of the Master, you will succeed to higher duties. Your acquirements must, therefore, be such that the Craft may never suffer for want of proper instructions. From the spirit which you have hitherto evinced, I entertain no doubt that your future conduct will be such as to merit the applause of your brethren and the testimony of a good conscience.

I, therefore, trust that you will have but one aim, to please each other, and unite in the grand design of being happy and communicating happiness. Finally, my brethren, as this Association has been formed and perfected in so much unanimity and concord, in which we may greatly rejoice, so may it long continue.

(The following, or an appropriate original oration, may then be delivered, and the ceremonies concluded with music:) Oration Brethren, the ceremonies we have performed are not unmeaning rites, nor the amusing pageants of an idle hour, but have a solemn and instructive import. Suffer me to point out to you, and to impress upon your minds, the ennobling sentiments they are so well adapted to convey. This Hall, designed and built by Wisdom, supported by Strength and adorned in Beauty, we first consecrated in the name of the Great Jehovah; which teaches us, in all our works, begun and finished, to acknowledge, adore, and magnify Him. It reminds us, also, in His fear to enter the door of the Lodge, to put our trust in Him while passing its trials, and to hope in Him for the reward of its labors. Let its altar, then, be devoted to His service, and its lofty arch resound with His praise! May the eye which seeth in secret witness here the sincere and unaffected piety which withdraws from the engagements of the world to silence and privacy, that it may be exercised with less interruption and less ostentation. Our march around the \"Lodge\" reminds us of the travels of human life, in which Masonry is an enlightened, a safe, and a pleasant path. Its tessellated pavement in mosaic-work, intimates to us the checkered diversity and uncertainty of human affairs. Our step is time; our progression, eternity. Following our Ancient Constitutions, with mystic rites, we dedicated this Hall to the honor of Freemasonry. Our best attachments are due to the Craft. We find our joy in its prosperity, and we honor ourselves in paying it honor. But its worth transcends our encomiums, and its glory will outsound our praise. Brethren: It is our pride that we have our names on 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"the records of Freemasonry. May it be our high ambition that they should shed a luster on the immortal page! The Hall is also dedicated to Virtue. This worthy appropriation will always be duly regarded while the moral duties which our sublime lectures inculcate, with affecting and impressive pertinency, are cherished in our hearts and illustrated in our lives. As Freemasonry aims to enliven the spirit of philanthropy, and promote the cause of charity, so we dedicate this Hall to Universal Benevolence, in the assurance that every brother will dedicate his affections and his abilities to the same generous purpose; that while he displays a warm and cordial affection to those who are of the Fraternity, he will extend his benevolent regards and good wishes to the whole family of mankind. Such, my brethren, is the significant meaning of the solemn rites we have just performed, because such are the peculiar duties of every Lodge. I need not enlarge upon them now, nor show how they diverge, as rays from a center, to enlighten, to improve, and to cheer the whole circle of life. Their import and their application are familiar to you all. In their knowledge and their exercise may you fulfill the high purposes of the Masonic Institution! How many pleasing considerations, my brethren, attend the present interview! While in almost every other association of men, political animosities, contentions, and wars, interrupt the progress of humanity and the cause of benevolence, it is our distinguished privilege to dwell together in peace, and engage in plans to perfect individual and social happiness. While in many other nations our Institution is viewed by politicians with suspicion, and by the ignorant with apprehension, in this country its members are too much respected and its principles too well known to make it the object of jealousy or mistrust. Our private assemblies are unmolested, and our public celebrations attract a more general approbation of the Fraternity. Indeed, its importance, its credit, and, we trust, its usefulness, are advancing to a height unknown in any former age. The present occasion gives fresh evidence of the increasing 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"affection of its friends, and this noble apartment, fitted up in a style of such elegance and convenience, does honor to Freemasonry, as well as reflects the highest credit on the respectable Lodge, for whose accommodation and at whose expense it is erected. We offer our best congratulations to the Worshipful Master, Wardens, officers and members of  Lodge. We commend your zeal, and hope it will meet with the most ample recompense. May this Hall be the happy resort of piety, virtue and benevolence! May it be protected from accident, and long remain a monument of your attachment to Freemasonry! May your Lodge continue to flourish; your union to strengthen; and your happiness to abound! And when you, and we all, shall be removed from the labors of the earthly Lodge, may we be admitted to the brotherhood of the perfect in the building of God, the Hall not made with hand, eternal in the heavens!

(In case of an emergency they shall assemble at such place as may be designated by the Master of the Lodge, a Lodge of Sorrow having already been opened in accordance with the General Regulations.) On receiving word of a Brother's death in some distant place and his body is not being returned for burial, the nearest Lodge to the deceased shall be notified of his death and requested to give him Masonic burial, if the family so desires.

The service presented here is effective if properly presented. It is necessary that the officers who deliver it should study it carefully.

In case of need almost any part may be omitted, but to constitute Burial with Masonic Honors, two elements are essential and these may not be omitted: 1. The Presentation of the Apron and 2. The Tribute of Acacia. Final Masonic Rites should in no way reproduce or copy the ritual services of the church, synagogue or mosque. Our Rites are a Masonic tribute to the deceased Brother and they must and should affirm in our own language and symbolism the teachings of our Ancient Craft, not only about virtue and morality, but also our belief in the immortality of the soul. They are also our means of extending our sympathy and sorrow to the family and friends who remain. The language, prayers, and scriptural texts used should reflect the best Masonic traditions.

The Lodge may be opened for each such occasion, if the Master so desires, or a Lodge of Sorrow can be opened at the beginning of the year and remain open for the purpose of conducting Final Masonic Rites. The Lodge of Sorrow should be opened at the first stated meeting after installation of Lodge officers. The Lodge of Sorrow can then remain open for the entire year and be closed either at the last stated meeting of the year or at a Special Communication held prior to the next installation of officers. The following ceremony for opening the Lodge of Sorrow is a suggested form that can be used at the discretion of the Master. Any and all parts of this suggested ceremony can be modified, eliminated, or replaced to fit the needs and desires of the Lodge. The Lodge having been opened on the Master Mason degree, the following ceremony is conducted at some convenient time. CEREMONY FOR OPENING A LODGE OF SORROW W.M. \"Brethren, we will now proceed to open our Lodge of Sorrow for the coming year. Brother Senior and Junior Wardens, please assist me.\" (Wardens stand) W.M. \"Brethren, the Lodge of Sorrow reminds us that in the midst of life we are near death, and we know not when the summons of death may come to one of us.\" S.W. \"We walk in the light while we have the light, but the darkness of death may come upon us at a time when we are not prepared.\" 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"J.W. \"We know not when the Master will call; at evening, at midnight, or in the day.

But should it be your will to call for workmen from among our ranks, then help those remaining to see the Wisdom in Your choice. (Chaplain may add further words as he sees fit.) AMEN\" W.M. \"I now declare the Lodge of Sorrow of Lodge number open for the year , its labors to assume as they may be required.\" * The Lodge of Sorrow should be properly closed at the end of its year of labors by a ceremony that is appropriate to the tasks it has been called upon to perform. If any Brethren have died during the year, it is appropriate to hold a memorial service in their memory, and to do this in conjunction with the formal closing of the Lodge of Sorrow. This ceremony can be conducted at the last Stated Communication of the Master's year, or at a Special Communication called for the purpose. In either case, the families and friends of the deceased can be invited to the Lodge to take part in the ceremony. The Lodge having been opened on the Third Degree, the Master states the purpose and proceeds.

It is an act of great discourtesy to a visiting Grand officer, to omit his formal reception by the Lodge, except at his express wish. The Grand Master or his representative should require it. Even when such visit is unofficial it will be found to greatly increase a true fraternal feeling when this courtesy is properly shown. When a visit from the Grand Lodge, Grand Master or his proxy, Deputy Grand Master, or a Grand Warden, is expected, a suitable room should be provided for their use, if possible. I. - The Grand Master When the Tyler announces the presence of the Grand Master, as he should, the Master sends out the Marshal, Deacons, Stewards, and one of the oldest members (a Past Master, if possible) bearing the Book of Constitutions, to escort him, and any Grand Officers accompanying him, into the Lodge room. The most frequent practice is to have a Past Master act as the Marshal. They form a procession in the following order: Marshal Stewards Grand Officers Brother with the Book of Constitutions Grand Master Deacons. (See the diagram on the following page) When the procession enters the Hall, the Stewards will halt, cross their rods, the Marshal will announce: \"The Most Worshipful Grand Master of Masons of Minnesota.\" The Lodge is then called up. The procession passes by the 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Stewards to the altar. On arriving at the altar the other officers, if any, open ranks and face inward, the Grand Master passes through to the altar, while they, filing right and left, form a line across the Hall. The private Grand Honors are then given. The Master advances to the altar, and extending his hand, gives the Grand Master a cordial welcome, tenders him the gavel, and conducts him to the East, and the Master uncovers. The other Grand Lodge Officers are given seats in the East, and the Lodge is seated. The Grand Master may decline to receive the gavel or chair, or may resign them at any time at his pleasure. Should he wish to retire, the Lodge is called up, the same Grand Honors are given, and he and his suite are escorted as before, to his apartment. Should the Grand Lodge (the Grand Master, all the Grand Lodge Officers and others entitled) pay a visit as such, their reception will be similar to that accorded the Grand Master. The form of reception to be given the Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wardens, or the Grand Master's proxy, on being announced as an Official Visitor, he will be substantially the same as for the Grand Master, except that the Book of Constitutions will not be borne before them. II.â€” Other Brethren When a brother Mason visits a Lodge he must be examined or vouched for. Great care should be exercised before admitting any unknown brother. None such should be permitted to visit a Lodge, unless a member in good standing of some lawful Lodge. The law of this jurisdiction (found in the General Regulations) is strict, in regard to visitation. The visitor must produce a receipt or certificate not more than a year old, showing his Masonic standing in a regular Lodge, which will be ascertained by reference to the Official List of Regular Lodges furnished by the Grand Lodge. The visitor's name, Lodge, and residence, should be sent by the Tyler to the Master, who will appoint a committee of two to retire and examine him. He should, 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"after giving in writing his name, Lodge and its location, then take the test oath. The committee will examine him, and test his knowledge of the degrees and work in general, after which they will return and report in full to the Master, who will then decide whether to admit him or not. If he is to be admitted, the Master will send the SENIOR DEACON to introduce him, who will receive him at the door, conduct him to the altar and say: Worshipful Master, I have the pleasure of introducing to you Brother  , of  Lodge, No. , at . (The Master calls up the Lodge and says:) Brother , it gives me pleasure to introduce you to the members of Lodge, No. , and to welcome you to a seat among us. We meet on , and shall be very glad to welcome you to any of our meetings. Brother Senior Deacon, conduct the brother to a seat. (This is done and the Lodge is then seated.) If the visitor is a Past Master he should be invited to a seat in the East, and if he is an officer of any Grand Lodge or prominent member of our own Grand Lodge, he should be received with the Grand Honors at the time of his introduction. While a formal introduction is not expected or necessary after the first visit,â€”yet the Master should take great care to extend the proper courtesies to visiting brethren at all times, and to make them feel that they are indeed welcome. He should invariably, as soon as the Lodge is opened, give a general invitation to all Past Masters to take seats in the East if there is room for them, and this invitation should be accepted by those present, especially if visitors, unless there are special reasons for not doing so. An Entered Apprentice or Fellowcraft Mason can visit only on those degrees and then only in company with a Master Mason who actually saw him take them. 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIV SUGGESTED CEREMONIES FOR PRESENTATIONS FIFTY YEAR EMBLEM At the time the presentation is to be made, which should be in open Lodge, the Master should proceed as follows: (Use plural when applicable.) MASTER: Our installation ceremony includes a statement that the duties of a Master are many and various â€” some of those duties are arduous and difficult, others fall in the class of pleasant experiences. It is, tonight, my very pleasant duty and privilege to announce that the completion of fifty years of membership by one of the brethren of this Lodge has been recognized by the Grand Lodge of Minnesota. Brother Marshal (Marshal rises and salutes) â€” you will conduct Brother to the Altar.

(Applause by the brethren). Master seats himself, seats Lodge. MASTER: Brother Secretary (Secretary rises and salutes)â€”you will please read the Masonic record of Brother  (Secretary reads the record, including dates of initiation, passing and raising, Lodges to which the Brother has belonged and Masonic Honors, if any.)

(If the Brother to be honored is active, he should be asked to riseâ€”if aged or infirm, he should be permitted to remain seated while being addressed until the actual presentation of the emblem.) G. L. Rep: Brother over a half century ago you knelt at the altar of Masonry and repeated the obligations which, though old, are ever new to the faithful of the Craft. I take this opportunity of congratulating you on behalf of the Grand Lodge on this, the Golden Anniversary of your affiliation with the Sons of Light. Since your initiation into our Fraternity, you have observed many changes in our ways of lifeâ€”nations have flourished and fallen, but through it all our Institution remains unchanged and unchanging. Your continuous membership of over fifty years is, in itself, evidence of your continued adherence to the tenets of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth, and of your appreciation of the associations afforded by membership in our Fraternity. It is now my duty and my privilege as Representative of the Grand Lodge A.F. & A.M. of Minnesota to present to you this tangible evidence of the appreciation of the Masonic Fraternity as a whole and more especially that of the Grand Lodge of Minnesota and of  Lodge No. of   of your faithful observance of the obligations taken by you so many years ago, and we sincerely trust that as you continue your journey along life's highway, the knowledge that you have been and still are appreciated and held in esteem by your Masonic Brethren will afford you pleasure and that you will, as admonished by the poet: \"Grow old along with me, The best is yet to be. The last of life, For which the first was made.\" (Affixes emblem â€” clasps honored Brother's hand and allows him an opportunity of making any remarks if he so desires.) 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"(At the conclusion of the Brother's remarks, if any, the G. L. Rep. should address the brethren in accordance with his desires, after which he thanks the Master and is seated, and the Master continues with the business of the evening. MASONIC WIDOW'S PIN The Grand Lodge of Minnesota MASONIC WIDOWâ€™S PIN was created to formally honor and recognize the widow of a brother to whom the Craft owes special ties of care and concern. Annually each Constituent Lodge is encouraged to include the presentation of this pin in a program as a \"Widowâ€™s Night\" or in conjunction with another special evening when it would be appropriate to invite the widows of the Lodge to come as guests of the Lodge. It is highly recommended that this evening emphasize the special place with which we hold the widows of our Lodge. Timely preparation should be given to the planning and incorporation of the widows into the program. If possible, the widows should be given formal invitations signed by the Master of the Lodge along with a request that they will be chauffeured to the Lodge as special guests. If a dinner is to be served it is expected that the widows will be the guests of the Lodge. Program for a Widowâ€™s Night could be as follows: 1. Welcome by the Master of Ceremonies and if a dinner is held, the invocation is given prior to the meal. 2. Master of Ceremonies introduces escorts for flag if any, and leads the audience in the pledge of allegiance. 3. Master of Ceremonies introduces the Master of the Lodge. 4. Master welcomes members and friends and introduces lodge officers and special guests. 5. Master announces the names of departed brethren during the preceding year and gives a brief summary of the 127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"positions, duties or contributions of the individual brothers to the Lodge. 6. Master invites the widows to come forward and reads the following address concerning the Masonic widowâ€™s pin: This pin was created as an emblem to symbolize our continued concern and honor for the widow of a Brother Master Mason, a Brother whose name added luster to the Craft as he labored with us in the Quarry. Now that his name has been entered upon the Roll of the Celestial Lodge, we cannot forget those things which he loved so deeply, nor can we be unmindful of our duty to him. It is my distinct privilege to present this emblem to you that you may wear it with great pride. It is our desire that it be to you a reminder of your ties to us: a relationship wherein you will find friends who will assist you in times of need, join with you in times of gladness, and welcome you to a continued association with us as we continue our labors of Friendship, Brotherly Love and Truth. You are not alone.When moments may cause you to doubt, look at this emblem and be assured that we are there and we care. (At this point the Masonic Widowâ€™s Pin is pinned on the outer garment of each widow so as to be in plain view. After which the following is to be spoken.) This Masonic Widowâ€™s Pin was created with the hope that it would be worn by the widow of a Master Mason on all appropriate occasions, especially when traveling, so that she may be recognized, greeted, and assisted when necessary, by Masonic friends throughout the world. It is an emblem of honor and should be worn separately, and not in conjunction with other jewelry. May she who wears this emblem find that she is not alone. We are there and we care. 7. Following the reading it would be appropriate to have the audience recognize the awarding of this pin with 128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"their applause. Time should be also be given before the widows are seated to ask if they have any comments. Some may be so overcome with emotion and the memories of the passing of their husband that they will be unable to respond. Others may want to share something about the importance of Masonry in the life of their deceased husband or the circumstances of their husbandâ€™s death and the support which the Lodge gave at that time. Such remarks, if volunteered, are quite appropriate and make the evening more meaningful. 8. Appropriate entertainment or a guest speaker (ideally sharing something about the meaning, symbolism or charity of the Craft) could conclude the program. Recognition should be given to all of those who helped to make the program a success. The Masonic Widowâ€™s Pin, with a card backing which gives the formal presentation address cited above, is available from the Grand Lodge office. The Master and Secretary of the Lodge should sign the card which accompanies the widowâ€™s pin before presentation. They should be ordered in ample time prior to the presentation. It is highly recommended that each Constituent Lodge annually set aside an evening or event to honor the widows of the Lodge. There may or may not be presentations of new Masonic Widowâ€™s Pins, however, the significance of the event is to remind the widows and lodge members that the widows of Masons are held in special honor and deserve our first response of Masonic charity or assistance. Along with the Masonic Widowâ€™s Pin, the Grand Lodge of Minnesota has created a Masonic Memorial Booklet titled \"A Tribute of Our Affection.\" This booklet, which has parts of the funeral or memorial service and prayers conducted for a deceased brother by the Lodge, may be given to the widow of a Master Mason on the same evening that the Masonic Widowâ€™s Pin is presented. This memorial booklet may also be purchased through the Grand Lodge office and should be filled out by the Lodge 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Secretary with the deceased brotherâ€™s Masonic history and signed by the elected officers of the Lodge. HIRAM AWARD The Grand Lodge of Minnesota HIRAM AWARD is a singular, once-in-a-lifetime recognition presented to a brother as an earned tribute for outstanding service to Freemasonry. The Master of every constituent Lodge in Minnesota is entitled to recognize one brother with this special distinction during his term of office. The local lodge should determine the criteria and method of selection. The HIRAM AWARD should not be presented posthumously. The Master of the lodge could appoint a committee of at least three to recommend possible recipients and coordinate all aspects of the program. It is highly recommended that a special evening be planned for the presentation of this award. This is not the time to combine several award presentations into one celebration. Each dedicated brother selected for the HIRAM AWARD deserves individual recognition. His years of devoted contributions to the Craft entitle him to a night when he alone enjoys a few moments in the spotlight of applause from his brothers, family and friends. This is not designed to be a \"surprise\" award, for this would deprive a brother from inviting friends, family and others only he would know. The evening should be well planned and publicized months in advance. Scheduling of the HIRAM AWARD gives your lodge an excellent opportunity to show off your lodge rooms to non-Masonic guests. The name of the recipient would be the principle attraction, as his service to others would be immediately recognizable. A dinner for the evening would be most appropriate. An invocation should be given before dinner. If your lodge dining room is too small to accommodate a crowd, donâ€™t hesitate to find a larger facility. Try to avoid having your HIRAM AWARD ceremonies in the lodge dining area. If 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"possible stage your program in the Lodge Room. HIRAM AWARD events are ideal times to invite members of the youth orders to participate in the flag salute, help with serving, etc. Donâ€™t forget to give them credit and introductions. If at all possible, the Master, lodge officers and distinguished guests are encouraged to wear tuxedos or formal attire. The evening is to be dignified. Occasionally, some type of entertainment might be injected into the program, however, IT IS THE HIRAM AWARDEEâ€™S SPECIAL NIGHT AND NOTHING SHOULD DETRACT FROM HIS RECOGNITION. A suggested program could be as follows: 1. Master of Ceremonies introduces escorts for flag if any, and leads the audience in the pledge of allegiance. 2. Master of Ceremonies introduces the Master of the Lodge. 3. Master of the Lodge welcomes members and friends and introduces the lodge officers and any special guests. 4. The Master of Ceremonies invites various brethren and friends to talk about the recipient. This is very important to do! BE CREATIVE! Under no circumstances should the evening be planned as a \"roast\" of the recipient. Careful preplanning is vital for a successful program. Alert the honoreeâ€™s friends, family members and Lodge brethren to be ready to speak briefly about him. 5. The Master of Ceremonies recognizes the Grand Lodge representative who has been invited (with a brief fraternal background) and calls for comments on \"what the HIRAM AWARD represents.\" As a representative of the Grand Master, he will pass the framed certificate to the Master of the Lodge. (The constituent lodge is to see that the certificate is suitably framed for presentation.) 6. The Master of the Lodge invites the HIRAM AWARD recipient and his spouse forward and makes a brief presentation on behalf of the Lodge. He then presents the HIRAM AWARD certificate to the recipient and invites 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"the audience to join him in a standing vote of appreciation. 7. The recipient of the HIRAM AWARD responds with his comments. 8. Any closing remarks may be made by the Master of Ceremonies or the Master of the Lodge (i.e. invitation for refreshments, thank you for attending, etc.). 9. The formal program should conclude with a closing prayer. If entertainment is to be utilized, it should occur between numbers 3 and 4 above. Nothing should detract from the actual honoring of the recipient. The Grand Lodge firmly supports the recognition of your nominee. We encourage you to take pictures and publicize this recognition in your local newspapers and lodge trestleboard. Publicize the fact that the brother selected for a HIRAM AWARD is being singled out as your local Lodgeâ€™s choice for personal tribute. The success of an outstanding HIRAM AWARD event is vitally dependent upon how much effort and enthusiasm are generated by all your members, not just a few committee members. Throughout the years, keep a history of the recipients. Your lodge may wish to purchase a special plaque to hang in the lodge with each recipientâ€™s name engraved on it and the year of the award. PROCEDURE FOR ORDERING THE HIRAM AWARD Each HIRAM AWARD certificate should be ordered from the Grand Lodge office at least one month in advance. Send the name of the recipient, intended date of presentation, and a brief statement on why this individual has been selected to receive this award. The Grand Lodge will have the recipientâ€™s name suitably lettered on the certificate and will forward it to the constituent lodge. The lodge should have the certificate suitably framed for presentation. The certificate should never be presented 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"without a frame as this would greatly detract from the dignity of the presentation. A standard 11 x 14 inch frame will nicely fit the award, or it can be matted to allow for an even larger frame. SUGGESTED PRESENTATION BY THE MASTER OF THE LODGE: The Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Minnesota bestows the HIRAM AWARD upon a Mason who has served his Lodge with distinction over a period of time. The Master of each constituent lodge may recommend one brother for this peculiar and special honor only once each year. We at _________________(name of lodge) have chosen a committee to determine fairly and objectively whether we have a brother deserving of this once-in-a-lifetime distinction. It is with great Masonic and personal pride that I announce the presentation of the HIRAM AWARD to Brother _________________ (name of recipient). You may ask, \"Why HIRAM?\" Who is this HIRAM and why do masons choose this name for the award? The Bible records that Hiram of Tyre was a famous artisan and builder at the construction of King Solomonâ€™s Temple in Jerusalem. In the Old Testament we read of Hiram in the First Book of Kings and the Second Book of Chronicles. King Solomon, in chapter 2 of the Second Book of Chronicles, \"determined to build a house for the name of the Lord and a royal residence for himself,\" and Solomon sent word to Huram or Hiram King of Tyre announcing his intentions and requesting his assistance. In response King Hiram sent building materials and his most trusted architect Hiram along with a letter of introduction which described his skills. In part, the letter read,\"Now I have sent a skilled man endued with understanding, Hiram abiâ€™ son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone and wood, AND in purple, blue and crimson fabrics 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and to execute any design that may be assigned to him.\" He is further described as a cunning workman and leader who could accomplish any task assigned to him. Truly this is the description of a remarkable person. We as Masons, have adopted the framework of building King Solomonâ€™s Temple, and the remarkable accomplishments of Hiram Abif as the central theme of our Masonic ritual. The character of Hiram who unselfishly applied himself to honor his god, better the conditions of his fellows, and who ultimately offered up his life rather than forfeit his integrity is revered by Masons and therefore forms the basis for the high honors which we confer this evening. As we apply the biblical description of Hiram the builder to Masonry, we occasionally identify among the brethren members who cheerfully take on any task assigned to them and accomplish it fully. Our honoree this evening is such a person. Since becoming a Mason in ______(year), __________________(recipientâ€™s name) has been asked to assume many responsibilities, and has volunteered for many more. At this time I would like to ask Brother _____________(name) to join us and provide a short list of our honoreeâ€™s achievements in Masonry. (Masonic record and achievements are read by the assisting Brother.) Brother ___________________(recipientâ€™s name), on behalf of the members of ____________ Lodge, it is with great personal pride that I present you with our Lodgeâ€™s HIRAM AWARD for ________(year). 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XV MUSICAL NOTES Melodies (Airs) for Masonic Odes Some of the melodies for the Masonic Odes given in the Minnesota Masonic Manual are very old and subsequently out of print or very hard to find. We have take the liberty to substitute some new hymn tunes with words and music which is more familiar and which are reprinted in this section. The lodges are encouraged to incorporate music into the ritual of the lodge work whenever it can be done with decorum and good planning. It is essential that if the music is to be sung by the brethren or by a soloist or ensemble that it be rehearsed. This can easily be done if musical accompaniment is provided and a few minutes of time are taken prior to the ritual work to rehearse the music. The inclusion of instrumental or vocal music, when well done, will add immeasurably to the meaning of the ritual work and give a wholesome and good affect for all who hear or are participating. The Grand Lodge Bookstore also carries \"Masonic Music for Lodge Degrees\" on four cassette tapes, which may be incorporated in the ritual degree work.
