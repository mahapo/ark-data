Voorhis Printed in the United States of America The most profound mystery in Masonry is its origin. Back of the period of authentic recoided history stretch misty avenues of speculation. So it is also with the Royal Order of Scotland. Interesting and beautiful theories of origin prevail. But this is not history—the record of authentic, indisputable events. The pearls of truth can sometimes be brought to view only through intensive investigation, and unfortunatety many records that would be invaluable to us are no longer available—if indeed they ever existed. There is always a tendency to review the past and to prophesy the future. Pride in accomplishment is one of the impelling forces that leads to progress. To review the past, to study the early days of our institution, and record notable events for posterity is the purpose of this history of our Royal Order. This work is as complete a history of the Provincial Grand Lodge for the United States of America as is feasible to prepare from ob - tainable data, containing as it does all available facts of general im - portance, and covering the formative years in the establishment of our Provincial Grand Lodge to ‘959. The account of the early events that resulted in the formation of the present Grand Lodge in Scotland, the introduction of the Order into the United States, and the progress that has been made through the years should make enjoyable as well as instructive reading for all members of the Order. The author is to be highly commended for his extensive research and for his meticulous attention to pertinent detail. He has exercised good judgment in the selection of material and acceptance only of such data as is of unquestioned authenticity and reliability. He has woveui together an intriguing history of the Royal Order of Scolland. The historian has well and faithfully performed his task. This volume will stand as testimony to his zeal, ability, and indefatigable industry. MARviN E. FOWLER, PROv. GRAND MASTER 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"PR EFACE Over a period of years many questions have been asked of me (in person and by [etter) concerning the Royal Order of Scotland. Many of these could not be answered as there seems to be no place where the answers are set down. I resolved, therefore, to do a bit of reseaich concerning the history of the Order so that pertinent questions regarding the organization, especially in the United States, might be found easily. The first problem was making a complete listing by name, date of affiliation, place of Masonic membership, and date of death or other reasons for unaffiliation From 1878 to September 25, 1958, I found 3767 members. A set of cards was made (with the help of Mrs. Voorhis) and after corrections and errors were ironed out, many with the help of the Provincial Grand Secretary, Charles Samson, the final figure checked with the records of living members in the office of the Order. 1 then compiled the rest of the information which I thought wou[d be of value and inteiest. The Pioceedings, however, did not record the modus operandi used to introduce the Order into the United States. I am indebted to George S Draffen, M.B.E., Junior Grand Warden of the Royal Order in Scotland, for the search of the records which brought forth this information. Not only did Sir George, who is a renowned Masonic historian, “help, aid and assist” me as above mentioned, but he has graciously allowed me to reproduce “Some Notes on the Early Records of the Order,” which appeared in Volume XXXII (i957) of the Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of the Order. This covers all that is known of historical interest from 1754 to 1775. It is an excellent work and shows the existence from, at least, 1754 as an entity. This is a date early enough to antedate that proven by most other Masonic groups outside of Cmft Masonry. And, finally, my thanks are again extended to my printei, and Masonic colleague, Rt. V/or Henry Emmerson, for his many sugges- tions of details in putting the work in print. It is a continuation of help he has so admirably given in all my previous books which he has printed. It is my hope that the contents of this brochure will help our members to know something about the Royal Order to which they belong. Harold V B.

DRAFFEN, M.B.E., JUNIOR Ga~i’m WARDEN [N JULY, 1750, the Provincial Grand Master of South Bntain re - ceived a petition from a certain William Mitchell and~ one Jonas Muck to erect a Chapter of The Royal Order at The Hague in the Seven United Provinces, as the Netherlands was at that time called. The onginal petition is still in the archives of the Order in Edinburgh and carnes an endorsement to the effect that it was granted. We know that this endorsement is a statement of fact, for the original Charter is also in the archives in Edinburgh. The Charter authorizes the intend - ed Chapter at The Hague to confer also the Degree of R.S.Y.C.S. Whether William Mitchell ever returned to The Hague is not known. What is certain is that he was resident in Edinburgh in 1753 and visited St. David’s Lodge (now No. 36) as “The N’lost Worshipful Grand Master of the Seven United Provinces and Provincial Grand Master from London Kilwinning over all Europe Britain excepted.” The quotation is from the Minute Book of Lodge St. David under the date 12th Septembei, 1753. There is a similar entry in its Minute Book under the date ioth October 1753. This record is of some importance as it is proof that rn 1753, at least, Mitchell still regarded himself as the Provincial Grand Master for the Netherlands. The earliest Record Book of The Royal Order (Edinburgh body) contains the names, etc., of one Candidate admitted in 1754, two in 1755, one in 1760 and ten in 1763. We may fairly assume from this record that when William Mitchell returned to Scotland either he (as seems the more likely of the two alternatives) started the first Chapter of The Royal Order in Scotland, or that some pre-existing Chapter of the Order (of which no knowledge has survived) was greatly strength - ened on his return. No information concerning Mitchell himself is contained in the records of The Order at Edinburgh, eiccept that when he was at The Hague his profession there was Writing Master (i.e. teacher of Calli - graphy); the Characteristic of Relief which he received when appointed as the Piovincial Grand Master at The Hague (and which he retained throughout his subsequent connection with the Order in Scotland); his few attendances at Meetings of the Order in Scotland; that he was, on his own account, admitted to the Order in France in 1749 and again 9"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"in London in i~~o; and that his last attendance at a Meeting of the Order in Edinburgh was in 1770. The Hague Charter in the archives of Grand Lodge is the original document, but it does not seem that the Edinburgh body ever regarded that document as authority under which it might or should work. Its preservation in Edinburgh seems to be a concomitant of Mitchell’s retum to Scotland. Having no further use for his Hague Charter and Commission, it would be natural for him to hand them over for pieser - vation by the Chapter of the Oider which he had set up or which he joined on his return to Scotland. If the records are correct, and there seems no reason to doubt their accuracy, Mitchell appears to have gone slowly about Royal Order matters in Scotland until 1763, when we have a large influx of mem - bers. It is possible that there were more admissions than are iecorded, for the Record Book contains a list of some ten members who were expelled from the Order before i 767 and whose dates of admission are not given. The Royal Order body set up or joined by William Mitchell in Edinburgh met in the Lodge Room of Lodge St. Andrew and appears to have moved to St. David’s Lodge Rooms about 1764. Later it met in the Rooms of Lodge St. Giles which later became those of The Lodge of Holyrood House (St. Luke’s). Calculations made from the recorded attendances after 3 ist Oc - tober, 1766, the date of the first Minute of the Edinburgh Chapter which is now the Grand Lodge of the Royal Order, show that at least forty-six admissions tcok place between 1763 and the 3 ist October, 1766. The Chapter met every month for some years after i 767 and we may assume that this was probably the practice before that time. With a monthly meeting, the figure of forty-six admissions gives an average of slightly over one candidate per meeting. The first recorded Meeting of the Edinburgh body held in Sf. David’s Lodge Room, took place on the 3 ist of October, 1766. The Minute is here reprinted in extenso . — “St. David’s Lodge, 3 ist Oct. i766. A Chapter was held, at which were present, Sir James Wisdom, Home Sir Vvrilliam Worship, Mason Sir William Moderation, Gibb Sir Peter Diligence, Smith (Shoemaker, Lodge No. 92 (I.C.) in 2 5 th Regt.)l Sir Vvrilham Zeal, Walker Sir John Sobriety, Murdoch Sir Maitland Modesty, Ballantinel Sir Robert Assistance, Home (Merchant, R.WM.

Examination (Inglis) formerly balloted in was this night received and raised to the H R.M. Sir William Worship (Mason) proposed Br. Daniel Chapman of Canongate Kilwinning.” This record is written on the first page of the oldest surviving Minute Book and is clearly the record of an established body, not some new organization recently set up. It is of interest to note that all those piesent were not members of the second (Rosy Cross) Degree. Indeed, Archibald Meggat, who had been admitted to the Order in 1763, had not yet been promoted to the Degree of Rosy Cross and, in fact, there is no record in subsequent Minutes that he ever was so promoted. Suc - ceeding Minutes show that the Degree of Rosy Cross was worked about four times a year and only conferred upon selected Brethren of Here - dom. There is no indication as to how the selection was carried out, but it seems to have been a matter of the social position of the aspirant. It was not i.mtil after i8r5 that all those who were admitted to the Degree of Heredom were also, and at the same time promoted to the Rosy Cross Degree. There are no records of William Mitchell ever having presided at any Meeting of the Edinburgh Chapter and it is consequently impossible to say whether or not he ever held the posi - 1 Information from other sources than Minutes. 2 The namie is spelt “Bannatine” in some, hut not all, of the succeeding Minutes. 10 ii"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"tion of Deputy Grand Master of the Order. It is unlikely—for, when he did attend, his presence is recorded as an ordinary member of the Order. At the Meeting held on 5 th January, 1767, the Laws and Consti - tutions were read over and approved. These were later reported as having been engrossed “in a small elegant folio book,” which is still in the archives of the Royal Order in Edinburgh and which represents the oldest copy of the Constitutions of the Order. It is clearly set out, in a footnote to the first law, that the King of Scots is Grand Master of the Order. Between the 31st of October 1766 and 28th July 1769 the Edin - burgh Chapter met on thirty-one occasions. The Meetings are recorded in the Minutes as “A Council of Knights” (ten Meetings), “A Meeting of the Chapter” (eleven Meetings), “Monthly Meeting” (ten Meet - ings). As far as the “Monthly Meetings” are concerned, the business conducted indicates that a Chapter Meeting was held. On the ten occasions on which the body met as a Council of Knights, the Rosy Cross Degree was conferred first, and thereafter a Chapter was opened and a candidate admitted to the Degree of Heredom. The first recorded Election Meeting was held on the 4 th of July 1767, the Minute being headed “being the anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn.” The following officers were elected:— James Secrecy (Ker) 2 Defender of the Tower and Grand Governor.

Grand Stewards The surnames, indicated within brackets, are not recorded in the actual record of the Meeting. There is no mention in any Meetings of James Ker ever having been elected as Grand Master, nor is he ever referred to by that title. As has been already stated, the Laws of 1767 lay down that the King of Scots was hereditary Grand Mastei, and previous writers have been in error in referring to James Ker and his successors as “Grand Master.” The election of three officers to fill the positions of Senior Grand Warden, Junior Grand Warden with Senior Grand Guardian, and Junior Grand Guardian is interesting. Those who have filled these positions, either in Grand Lodge or Provincial Grand Lodges, will appreciate that the division of duties, evidently practised by our predecessors until as late as 186+ has something to recommend it, It is evident from the titles and numbers of off cers elected in 1767, that there has been little change during the last two hundred years. That the membership of the Edinburgh Chapter was a limited one is revealed in a portion of the Minute of 5 th October, 1767. The relative portion runs:— “It was moved by the Most Worshipful Deputy Govemor that in respect, it had been agreed when this oider was re-erected in this country, that the Members should not exceed the number of one hundred and twelve and that that number was near filled up. And if the Brethren were not to alter that resolve soon it might be a gieat loss to the order and many worthy Brethren might be disappointed of being received members. Therefore it was recoin- 1 David Steuart, Banker. Lord Provost of Edmhurgh, 1780-82. Later A4er- chant in Barcelona. Lodge Canon gate Kilwinning. 2 Oj A4ugdrum, W S.

See Note 2, page 70. 12 13"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"mended to the Brethren Knights that they might take this matter under consideration and be ready to give their opinion against the meeting of the next Council.” There is no mention of any direct action having been taken on this motion of the Deputy Governor, but since a Committee was ap - pointed on the 4 th of January 1768 to compile a list of additional Characteristics, it may be assumed that the limit to membership was abolished soon after that date. If the date of “re-erection” be taken as 1754, it is possible to trace some sixty-nine entrants into the Order between 1754 and October 1767. If the Deputy Governor felt, in 1767, that the number of members was getting to a hundred and twelve then there must be at least thirty or thirty-five entrants untraced (and un - traceable) from the Minutes and other surviving records. Some (or all) of them might have been members of a Royal Order body in Edinburgh existing in 1754, if there was such a body. The Minutes of the Meetings between October 1767 and February 1769 are of little historical interest. They show a lively Organization, which rejected two candidates in the ballot and admitted twenty-two members into the Order. A balance of £45 was reported as in the Treasurer’s hands at the close of 1768 The first use of the title “Grand Lodge” occurs in 1769. A Meeting was held on the 28th of July 1769 and is here reproduced in part:— “St. David’s Lodge. 28th July 1769. The Deputy Governor was pleased to hold a Grand Lodge of Knights, in order to promote Brother Alexandei Integrity to the degree of Knighthood, after which, etc. etc.” The Deputy Govenor was William Mason, although the record of the Meeting gives not a single name of a member who was present. After the ceremony of promotion the Deputy Governor informed the members present that he had been able to make arrangements with the Edinburgh Town Council to have future meetings held in the rooms of Lodge St Giles’. This Lodge was a tenant of the Edinburgh Town Council until it united with Lodge Canongate Kilwmning in i779. William Mason had also made an arrangement with Lodge St. Giles fQr the use of the latter’s “Tables, Forms, Lustres and Steward’s Room.” It seems from the Minutes that the Royal Order met in the rooms of Lodge St. Giles by “grace and favour” rather than as sub- 1 Previously Lodge Vernon Kilwinnrng. tenants. The Town Council asked no fee from the Royal Order, nor did Lodge St. Giles, though the Royal Order made a money gift of twenty guineas to Lodge St. Giles. The approval of the Town Council appears to have been necessary, for the following entry is to be found in the records of the Edinburgh Town Council. “At Edinburgh the twenty sixth day of July one thousand, seven hundred and sixty nine years—on which Day, the Lord Pro - vost, Magistrates and Council, with the Deacons of Crafts, ordinary and extraordinary, of the City of Edinburgh, being in Council assembled, there was presented and read in Council, a Petition, of the Governor and other officers of the Royal Order of Ancient Scots Masonry, setting forth, that the Petitioners ~+io are com - posed of Members, from almost the whole regular Lodges in and about Edinburgh, had now the satisfaction to inform the honour- able Council, that after much trouble and a great deal of expense, they had been able, to revive and establish’ the ancient Order of Scots Masonry, in the metropolis of their native country, which would be attested, by several members of the Honourable Council, and members theieof, that the Petitioners have never had any fixed place for holding their Monthly and Quarterly Meetings. At first they met in the Lodge of Edinburgh St. Andiew and afterwards by the indulgence of the Lodge of St. David’s they were allowed to meet under their roof, etc. etc.” The Lodge of Edinburgh St. Andrew was chartered on the 2nd of Apnl 1745 and therefore must have been quite a young Lodge when first the Royal Order began to meet in its rooms. Lodge St. David, chartered 7 th February 1739, had been called Lodge Canongate from Leith until 764 50 that it was probably after that date that the Royal Order began to meet in their Lodge Room The expression in the Petition “from almost the whole regular Lodges in and about Edin - burgh” means, in my view, that the members of the Royal Order Grand Lodge were drawn from the Craft Lodges in and around Edinburgh, not from other Royal Order Lodges. Lodge St. Giles were somewhat offended that the Royal Order should have petitioned the Town Council over their heads and without consulting them as to a possible sub-let, but the matter was amicably settled and the Royal Order held their first Meeting in St. Giles’ Lodge This phraseology would he applicahie to events after 1754 even if there was a Royal Order hody then existing in Edinhurgh. 14 15"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Room on the 2 7 th of November 1769. The last Meeting held in St. David’s Lodge Room, on 4 th of October 1769, had but little business before it and the record closes with the words, “There being no further business a number of the Biethren adjourned to a tavem and supped together, took a social glass and then retired to their respective lodg - ings.” The ~%4inute of 2 7 th November 1769 gives, in a letter to Lodge St. Giles re dates of Meetings, the details of the Regular Meetings of the Royal Order at this time. These Meetings were:— (1) The Fourth Day of January, April, July and October, and (2) The last Friday of every month, except November and De - cember, and (~) The iath of December a total of fifteen L\\4eetings a year. As a general rule, but not invariably followed, the “Rosy Cross” or “Knighthood” was conferred only on the Quarterly Meetings in January, April, July and October. The iecord of the Meeting of 2 ~rd February 1770 contains the last recorded attendance of William Relief ~%4itchell. The Annual L\\4eeting of 4 th July 1771 is of interest because of the motion, laid before a meeting on 6th May 1771, that for the future the Characteristic of Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, should be attached to the holders of the offices of Deputy Governor and the two Grand Guardians while in office. This was agreed to and as Brothers John Philip and Archibald Meggat then held the Characteristics of Strength and Beauty, they were authorized to take the new Characteristics of Duration and Address. The Meetings held between 4 th July i771 and 4 th January 1775 record nothing of historical interest. At the January 1775 Meeting a motion was brought forward to purchase “a valuable and handsome set of Jewels, which belonged to the deceased brother George Fraser of the Excise, and which originally had belonged to a Chapter of this Order held abroad.” The proposal was unanimously agreed to and the Jewels are still in the possession of the Grand Lodge in Edinburgh. There is no mention of the wheieabouts of this “Chapter of this Order held abroad” and we are left with some tantalising speculations. On the 1 th of July 1776, James Kerr intimated that he did not de - sire re-election to the office of Deputy Grand Master and in his stead William Baillie was unanimously elected. THE ROYAL ORDER IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE 1877 In order to cover all matters concerning the Royal Order of Scot - land in the United States there is a facet, little known, which, if not set down, might plague historians or readeis in the future. - Robert B. Folger published a pretentious volume in New York iri 1862 which came out in a second edition in i88i titled “The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, in Thirty-Three Degrees. Known Hitherto undei the Names of the ‘Rite of Perfection’ — the ‘Rite of Heredom’ — the ‘Ancient Scottish Rite’ — the ‘Rite of Kilwinning’ — and last, as the ‘Scottish Rite, Ancient and Accepted,’ Etc.” Pages 381 tO 395 are devoted to the Royal Order of Scotland. The material as here used was to bolster the claims of the “Ceineau Scottish Rite.” There are a numbei of errors in fact and surmise to be found in the article, which I shall ignore. Instead of an analysis of it I will give an account of what really happened, from information supplied to me by Sir George S. Draffen, who made the research into the matter. On May i, 1786, a charter for a Chapter was issued to Jean Mathie - us at Rouen, France. During the next three years when contact between England and France was difficult because of the French Revolution. Mathieus chartered nine bodies in France and its possessions. None ot these were legal as Mathieus had no authority to issue any charters. These charters aie listed at the end of this chaptei. Because the charters were issued illegally, the membeis thereot’ and any groups emanating fiom them were likewise illegal. There is one which concerns us in the United States—Number 8 on the list, which is labeled “Grand and Sovereign Provincial Chapter of the St. Esprit” and/or “The Provincial Lodge of St. Domingo,” situated in Little Goave, San Domingo. The so-called Piovincial Giand Mastei was one Achille H uet de Lachelle. This individual, assuming an authority similar to that assumed by his superior, Mathieus, proceeded to establish lodges and chapters in San Domingo and on the continent of North America, those on the continent being: i—Chapter of Truth, Baltimore, Md. 2—Amis Choisis (1798), New Yorl~, N. Y. 3—Triple Union (‘795), New York, N. Y. 1 —Tmth and Union, Philadelphia, Pa. 5—Armty and Candor, Philadelphia, Pa. 17"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Triple Union Chapter in New York was chartered in 1795 to French refugees, who had previously constituted a Master’s Lodge (1793) “La Tendre Arnitie Franco-Americaine,” without any authority whatever. Soon after, and about the time the Chapter was formed the Lodge changed its name to “L’Unite Americaine.” The Amis Choisis Chapter was chartered to members in the same Lodge. This caused some kind of friction which resulted in a split and the name was again changed, this time to “L’Union Francais” in 1797. Achille Huet de Lachelle was in New York just after the split and it was he who char - tered “L’Union Francais” Lodge and “Amis Choisis” Chapter. As soon as they started working the Grand Lodge of New York, F & A.M., in - hibited any of their members visiting any of their Lodges in the State. This action stiried the members, which resulted in the Grand Lodge constituting a Lodge of the same name with the same members on June 26, i 79 8—it thus becoming a legal Lodge under the Grand Lodge and it exists to this day. The chartering of the Lodge by the Grand Lodge terminated any connection with the Royal Order of Scotland and “L’ Union Francaise” which was illegal in the first place. A copy of the charter granted to “Amis Choisis Chapter” shows the Issuing siguatures with characteris - tics Wisdom, Strength, Beauty, Gratitude, Royalty, Candor, Frank - ness, Constancy, and Humanity. That of Rende Jean Vanderbroeck was originally Sincerity but was changed to Wisdom.

Sir Albert Pike, Provincial Grand Master, appointed the Charter Members as officers—with Josiah Hayden Drummond as Provincial Deputy Grand Master and William Morton Ireland as Provincial Grand Secretary. Oddly, neither of these two were present. There were two members of the Royal Order of Scotland in the United States when Albert Pike entered into a correspondence with the Grand Lodge of the Order concerning the formation of a Provincial Grand Lodge in the United States. One member was Albert Gallatin Goodall of New York who was admitted in the London and the Metro - politan Counties Provincial Grand Lodge on August 8, 1873, with the characteristic “Adoption.” Goodall did not have a hand in the forma - tion of the United States body for what appears to be two reasons. He was not a member of the Grand Lodge in Scotland and, although a prominent Freemason well known to Albert Pike, the latter probably did not know that he had attained membership in the Royal Order. He became the 6rst affiliate of the newly formed body in 1878 and died in membership on February 19, 1887. The other member was George Stodart Blackie of Nashville, Ten - nessee. He was present in Edinburgh on April 6, 1857 and that day was admitted to membership in the Grand Lodge, with the character - istic “Impression.” His connection with the formation of the Provincial Grand Lodge of the United States can best be told by reproducing portions of the July 4, i 876 minutes of the Grand Lodge in Edinbuigh covering the circumstances “There was taken into consideration the correspondence with a view to establishing the Order in the United States of America between Brother the Hon. Albert Pike and the Deputy Grand Master and Governor. Also the Minutes of previous meetings and the correspond - ence between the Deputy Giand Master and Governor and Grand Secretary, when, on the motion of the Deputy Grand Master and Governor it was unanimously agreed: That is was desirable the Royal Order of Scotland should be established in the United States of Amer - ica. That with a view to the Order being efficiently promoted and at the same time managed so as to preserve its tone and character there, as it has done here, it could not be placed in safer hands than those of Brother the Honourable Albert Pike and to enable this to be carried out and as the only practicable method which appears at present open for admitting him a Member of the Order, that special power be con - ferred on Sir G.S.

He introduced The Masonic Order of St. Lawrence in the United States while living in New York in 1874, the story of which may be found in Miscellanea, Volume 5, 1950 (Official organ of the Allied Masonic Degrees of the U.S.A.). A long search has revealed the following information concerning him: GEORGE STODART Br~c1crE Born—April 10, i8~4, County Banif, North Scotland. Died—Jone 19, i88i, Nashville, Tennessee. Brother Blackie came to the United States in i8~6; entering at New York City on April i 9 th. He was a graduate of the Universities of Edinburgh and Bobb. He traveled through the middle West and South and arrived in Nashville, Tennessee, June 17, 1856. On September 8, i8~6, he returned to Scotland, sailing from Boston and landing at Liverpool. He studied for a few months in Paris, Edinburgh and other places and then returned to the United States, going to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and finally to Nashville, Tennessee, reaching the latter place in the summer of 1857. He was married on June 29, 1858, to a Tennessee girl, whose name is not mentioned in any of the sources I have examined. During the war between the States, he enrolled as a Private in the Rock City Guards and was promoted to the rank of Surgeon, first in the Provincial Army of Tennessee and then in the Army of the Con - federate States. After the war he continued residence in Nashville, except for a short residence in New York, 1874-5. During the summer of 1873 he made his last trip to Scotland, on a visit. His scholastic titles were Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Philosophy. MA5ONIC RECORD E.A.—i8 5 6 in Canongate Kilwinning Lodge, No. 2, Edinburgh, Scot - land, F.C. and M.M.—March 20, 1857.

A letter of thanks, sent to her after the meeting, is recorded in the Proceedings of that year. 4 In ~886, William Oscar Roome, son-in-law of Albert Pike, was appointed Provincial Grand Secretary. He immediately put the records of the Order in excellent condition and for thirty-three years issued"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"correct and excellent annual, and other, reports to the Provincial Grand Lodge. In 1887, Albert Pike delivered one of his several addresses given to the members of the Royal Order. This one pertains (among other things) to a reference to his interpretations of “The Symbolism of the Blue Lodge,” in the first section, and observations on the Royal Order in section two. I reproduce them verbatim as I think they should be read by every member of the Royal Order: I have kept the promise made to you at our last session, that I would write out my interpretations of the Symbolism of the Blue Lodge; and as soon as I can have a fair copy made, I will place it in the keeping of the Provincial Grand Secretary, so that it may be accessible to those who may desire to read it. It will be received upon the condition that it is not to be at any time, in whole or in part, published, or any copy of it made. Those things, the knowledge whereof was anciently confined to the Adepts, are to be confined to the Adepts still, and not loosely divulged to all the world; and no man or number of men will ever have a right to make common what 1 leave in special trust for a few, it being wholly mine to preserve or destroy as may seem to me good. Masonry has been so liberal already in the divulgation of its sym - bols, as not to know that it has any left to be divulged. A man is no longer satisfied with the acquisition of knowledge 01 the discovery of any key of mystery, for himself as a private possession, or to be shared with a few; but must forthwith rush into print and proclaim his discovery to all the world. I do not see why Masonry should desire to expound her symbolism urbi et orhi, since its secrets are the only ones which every one who reads has not had ample opportun. ity to learn. The very essence of her being consists in her symbolism. This makes her what she is. I have expressed this truth elsewhere in the aphorism, “Her symbolism is the soul of Free-Masonry.” Wearing the mask and garb of a common and laborious trade and occupation, she is the oldest and most venerable of all human institutions, and refuses to disclose herself even to the great mass of her own novices. We have not caied to establish Chapters of Heredom, and so to take upon ourselves the cares of government and administration. We fixed the utmost number of our membership at 175, for reasons satis - factory to ourselves, having none of that inordinate craving for new and constant and numerous accessions to our membership, whereby great detriment has come to Free-Masonry, by the attenuation of the ties of brotherhood, the slight estimate set upon solemn vows when they bind men to the performance of onerous duties to great multitudes of others, the divulgation of too much that takes place in the Lodges, the wild after every new thing that commends itself to men fond of novelty hunt after popularity, and the itching for notoriety, and the running and gew-gaws, as a superfluous addition to the steady edifice of the institution. Ours is a Masonic Order of unlinown origin and antiquity. While we reject as fabulous the account of its creation by Robert Bruce, as sensible men reject the 6ctions once gravely repeated as truths of his - tory in regard to the English Craft-Masonry, yet we know that the first Degree of the Royal Order is of pre-historic antiquity It is, as it de - dares itself to be, a gloss or commentary upon ancient Craft-Masonry, as this then existed in Scotland, showing its religious character and Christian meaning,—Christian, with the Christianity of John Knox and the Kirk of Scotland. The symbols, borrowed from Hermeticism, and incorporated into the Degrees in England, are not mentioned in it. It contained no mysticism and no philosphy; and it makes no mention of the Hiramic legend. It is a commentary on the old Scottish Masonry, as it existed before innovation commenced its work in England. It is entitled, therefore, in an eminent degree, to call itself Ma - sonic. It is valuable like all else that is ancient and venerable. And I think, moreover, that there are things in it that are worth studying, because they have profounder meanings than the words seem to im - port. Men in no small number, of whose intelligence one would with reason expect better things, seem crazed now in the quest for novelties and the making of new Degrees, for associations that entitle themselves Masonic, and for others to which Degrees seem as inappropriate as an opera hat would be to surmount the head of a mule. Even in England they have instituted a body of the Degree of Secret Monitor, of which there may in time be a Grand Body, of equal dignity and pretensions with the Marl~ Grand Lodge. All the Free-Masonry of the day is of modern origin, or so modern - ized, in Lectures, Ceremonial and Symbolism, that a Mason of the 27 26"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"time of Elias Ashmole would neither be able to prove himself a Mason nor find anything in the Lodge that he had ever seen or heard before. The new Masonry of the Blue Lodge no more resembles the old than a product of modem architectural genius in Washington resembles an old gable-roofed house still standing in Marblehead or Annapolis. Nothing that is practised to-day in Free-Masonry can at all compare in point of ~ntiqu ~ty with our Royal Order. Nothing has been changed in it, no innovation has been permitted. Its quaint old diction has been religiously preserved, and no sacriligious hand has undertaken to im - prove it. Here is the only place in Masonry where the law is, “Ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein.” “So may it continue to be hereafter, And Time’s deformed hand Write not one strange defeature in its face.” JOSIAH H. DRUMMO~4D SECOND PROVINCIAL GRAND MASTER I 1 The fourteenth Annual Meeting was held in Boston, Massachsetts, on September 14, 1891. Sir Albert Pike had passed away on April 2nd, so Josiah H. Drummond presided. The Provincial Grand Secretary read cop ~es of letters as follows: i—Pike’s appointment of Jacob R. Telfait of New York as Provincial Grand Treasurer in place of Robert McGraham (deceased)—date De - cember 15, 1890. 2—Brummond’s letter as Acting Provincial Grand Master, announcing tEe passing of Pike (April ic, 1891). 3—Drummond’s letter to Roome, instiucting him to obtain possession of the warrant book and other property of the Royal Order of Scotland. 4—Drummond’s letter of appointment of Charles Heaton of Vermont, as Piovincial Giand Marischal, in place of Franklin H. Bascom (de - ceased). The Allocution of Drummond contained some interesting points, which I reproduce herewith: It seems that under the practice of our Grand Lodge at Edinburgh, Provincial Grand Lodges are created whose existence terminates with the death or resignation of the Provincial Grand Master. But in the case of our Provincial Grand Lodge an exception was made to this extent: By a supplemental charter, its existence was continued for three months after the death of the Provincial Grand Master then appointed. Under this provision unless a new appointment should be made, the e~cistence of this Giand Lodge would have terminated on the second day of July, 1891. I received a letter from D. MURRAY LYON, the Grand Secretary, under date of May ui~, 1891, which is herewith submitted. In it Brother LYON announces that the Grand Lodge contemplated the establishment of other Provincial Grand Lodges in the United States on the ground that the territory is too large for only one Provincial Grand Lodge, and, as you perceive from the letter, desired my opinion in relation to the matter. 29"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"GRAND LODGE OF THE Roy~xi.

It will be gratifying to Grand Lodge to have the benefit of your advice with regard to the point raised in my letter to you of 1 3 th May. An impression exists that the membership of the R. 0. in the States is too limited. W’ith fraternal salutations, Yours ever fratemally, D. MURRAY LYON, Gr. Seczetary You will note the concluding sentence that “an impression exists that the membership of the Royal Order in the States is too limited.” I had supposed that when the original limitation was adopted at the organization of this Provincial Grand Lodge, the action was in accord - ance with the views and wishes of the Grand Lodge. I confess that my own opinion accords with that of the brethren in Scotland, that, con - sidering the very large number of Masons in this country, the number is too limited, and the question presents itself at once whether in any event the good of the Order does not call for the iepeal of that limita - tion, and the matter of increase of members be left to the judgment of the Provincial Grand Lodge as from time to time it shall deem for its interests. I believe it is the fact, however, that until within two years the limit has not interfeied with us, but that we have had i~om for all the candidates who had presented themselves, and probably such has been the fact until the present time, although I know that at the last meet - ing petitions were before the Grand Lodge which were not acted upon; still, I believe that all were acted upon from candidates who were in attendance and desired to have the orders at that time. From inquiries which have been made of me and petitions which have been presented for the orders, I am satisfied that if we insist upon the limit we shall have ~odecline to receive quite a number of applications. 31"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"With this statement, and the oral explanation which I have made, I submit the matter to you, hoping that you will give such expression to your views as will enable me to make an authorative statement of them tQ the Grand Lodge.

A Fee of £3-3-o is payable on commission. Ever with the old regard, D. MURRAY LYON, Grand Secretary. On February 20, 1892, 1 received my commission as Provincial Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge of the United States, which I have just read to you. It will be observed that this document continues in force the original charter of constitution of this Provincial Grand Lodge, granted to Brother Pnce under date of the fourth day of October, A. D. 1877, as published in the Records and Minutes for 1878, (pages four to six, inclusive). For the information of our members, I recommend that that charter be reprinted in the Records and Minutes of this session. The commission lenews the special powers and privileges granted to my predecessoi by the commission printed in the Records and Minutes of 1878, (page seven). So the Provincial Grand Lodge has, to all intents and purposes, been continued in existence without any change in its prerogatives or duties. It will be noted, also, that it seems to be required that I shall be formally installed as Provincial Grand Master. I confess that this sug - gestion of Grand Secietary LYON somewhat surpn.sed me, for I had supposed that it had not been the usage among Masons to install Provincial Grand Masters, especially when appointed for Provinces remotely situated from the seat of the parent Grand Lodge. I am sure that my predecessor was never installed, and I find no such requirement in the Constitutions and Laws of the Order. I, therefore, infer that installation is not absolutely necessary to enable me to enter upon the duties of the office. I have been anxious, however, to comply with the request of the Grand Secretary, but have been unable to do so for the reason that there is no one in this Jurisdiction, and, so far as I know, no one on this Continent, qualified to install me. However, upon sug - gesting this difficulty to the Grand Secretary, he has more recently informed me that Brother Jom~ W. MURTON, of Hamilton, Canada, had been appointed Provincial Grand Master for the Dominion, and it was believed that there is a brother in that Jurisdiction qualified to install him, and then Sir JohN could install me. I hoped to meet him at the recent session of the Supreme Council for the Northem Jurisdic - tion in Providence, but he was not present. Unless he shall be here this week in attendance on the Supreme Council, it would seem that I must go to Canada in search of one qualified to install me, or forego the privilege. While I have no question of my right, under this commission, to discharge the duties of the office, I have deemed it advisable to make no permanent appointments of Provincial Grand Officers until I shall have been installed, or found that it is practically impossible to find a brother qualified to install me. I have, therefore, requested the brethren who were office bearers in the Provincial Grand Lodge on the fourth day of October, A.D. 1891, to continue to exercise the duties of their respective offices, by special appointment, until the close of this ses - siOn. There is one matter which requires consideration by you, glowing out of our action last year. The repeal of the limit of membership has been greatly misunderstood in some instances. It has been assumed that the repeal of the limitation opens the door to all Royal Arch Masons in good standing to apply for admission as a matter of course, precisely the same as a profane of good character may apply for admis - sion into Masonry. An examination of our iecords shows that admissions were first made only upon nominations, and petitions were first used only after the nominations had been made. The use of petitions may have aided in creating a false impression. I have no particular measure, as a rule of limitation, to recommend, but I call upon you to remember, in making nominations, and to impress upon the minds of those seek - ing admission, that the Royal Order should not be given as a matter of course, but only to those who have served Masonry zealously, faith - fully and ably, and who are recognized by their brethren as deserving Masonic honors by meritious services. And I suggest that the brother 34 35"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"recommending a candidate hereafter be required to state the Masonic services of the nominee upon which his recommendation is based. In justice to the Provincial Grand Secretary, I desire to state that I am alone responsible for delaying the publication of the Records and Minutes of our last session, for reasons that seemed to me sufficient. There has been one result which I overlooked. The passage of the reso - lution requiring the names of candidates to be given in the notice of this meeting escaped my memory. As the Minutes were not printed the brethren were not notified of it, and those who were present at our last session had no better memories than I did. When the matter was called to my attention I directed the issuing of a circular, but at so late a date that its object was only in a slight degree accomplished. Under these circumstances, I suggest that the rule should be suspended foi this session, in order that petitions which would have been presented in season may now be received.

A letter was read from D. ~VIurray Lyon, Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of the Royal Order of Scotland in Edinburgh, which stated that they had “returned to its ancient practice in admitting Mastei Masons to the Oider.” At the meeting in 189± Sir John Walter Murton, Provincial Grand Master of Ontario and Quebec was again present, but there seems to be no reference that Drummond was installed by him. A resolution was passed which increased the fee of admission to $25.00 and any member owing dues for two years and three months was to be auto - matically suspended. The Rev. Frank Erwin Brandt was made an Emei - itus Member for life and in 1901 the Rev. Hartley Carmichael was exempted from further payment of dues. I JAMES D. RICHARDSON THIRD PROVINCIAL GRAND MASTER In 1903, the Acting Piovincial Grand Master; James D. Richard - son, issued a Proclamation concerning the passing of Josiah H. Drum - mond, Provincial Grand Master. On November, t2, i902, Richardson notified the Grand Lodge in Scotland of Drummond’s passing and the Grand Lodge authorized the Provincial Grand Lodge to continue in full force until November 30, 1903. Sir James D. Richardson was then unanimously nominated to the office of Provincial Grand Master, and on December 14, 1903, Scotland notified the Provincial Grand Secre- tary that they had appointed James Daniel Richardson, Provincial Grand Master of the Province of the United States of America. On December 28th, Richardson appointed Sir Henry L. Palmer of Mil - waukee, Wisconsin, as D~puty Provincial Grand Master. At the 904 meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, the Right Honor - able the Earl of Euston, 330, G.C.T, Supreme Grand Master of the Great Pnory of England, K.T.; Charles Fitzgerald Matier, 330, G.C.T., Great Vice-Chancellor, K.T., and five other distinguished English Templars and members of the Royal Order of Scotland, were greeted as visitors. At this meeting the following publications were designated “official journals” of the Royal Order of Scotland: The New Age—Washington, D C. (monthly) The Keystone—Philadephia, Pa. (weekly) The American Tylei—Ann Arbor, Mich. (semi-monthly) The Masonic Voice Review—Chicago, Ill. (monthly) The “Official Joumal” list is listed and changed off and on for some years. Deletions and additions were made at various times. The following two aie mentioned: ‘The Masonic Standaid” of New York and “The New England Ciaftsman” of Boston. The matter of membership in the Grand Lodge in Scotland for members of the Provincial Grand Lodge in the U.S. came up in 1903 and is best reviewed by printing here tie situation as given in the 1905 Proceedings: Gi~M~n LODGE OF ThE ROYAL ORDER OF ScoTlAND Tiff KING OF ScomA=rn HEREDITARY Gi~n M A.s’rm~ 10 RANDOLPH PLACE, EDINBURGH, ScOTlAND, i6th December, 1903 MY DEAR Six ~n BROTHER: I was duly favored with your letter stating that Grand Lodge is requested to enroll as members of Grand 36 37"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Lodge the names of Sir James Daniel Richardson and Sir George May. hew Moulton and Sir Alhson Nailor. These recommendations were laid before a meeting of Executive Committee held on Friday and I am requested to say that Grand Lodge does not enroll Members of Pro - vincial Grand Lodges except by affiliation or presentation of an appli - cation in the forms which I enclose, signed by two members of Grand Lodge. The signature of the Provincial Grand Master will be sufficient as one of the signatures, and I shall arrange to get a member of Grand Lodge to act as the other. The application will be considered by Grand Lodge in the usual manner, and aftei election the affiliated Brethren will complete their membership by taking the oath of fidelity when they happen to be in this country The position of Provincial Grand Master is different, and the Executive Committee are of opinion that he should ex officio be. come a member of Grand Lodge during the term of his Provincial Grand Mastership. It is accordingly proposed to make this recommenda - tion at next meeting of Grand Lodge. Believe me, Yours very fratemally, W. Osc~ ROOME, EsQ Jorm H. FOREST, Grand Secretary. The Provincial Grand Secretary submits that when this Provincial Grand Lodge was organized, membership in the Grand Lodge was granted for thirteen of our members, and every year since that time the names of those who survived were so published in our printed Records and Minutes. In 1889, five vacancies existed in this roll of honor, and the Pro - vincial Grand Master, Sir Albert Pike, requested the Grand Lodge to elect four of our members, whose names he then submitted, to fill that number of vacancies, leaving one place yet to be filled. His request was at once courteously granted as will appear in his Allocution read at the meeting in 1890, and may be found’ on page 369, Vol. 1, Rec. ords and Minutes, from which the following paragraph is an extract: “To fill the places in the membership of the Grand Lodge of the Royal Order at Edinburgh, made vacant by the deaths of Sir John Robin McDaniel and Sn Albert Gallatin Mackey, and by the with - drawal from this Provincial Grand Lodge of Sii Enoch Terry Caison, and the election not to continue being a member of Sir William Mor - ton Ireland. Sir John Longwortli Stettinius, Sii Henry Moore Teller, Sir William Reynolds Singleton and Sir Frederick Webbei have been 38 I elected and enrolled members of Grand Lodge. One vacancy still re - mains to be filled, caused by the death of Sir Charles Roome.” From that time the list of our members of Grand Lodge was an - nually published showing the survivors of each class, i.e., the Charter list and the list elected in i 889. In 1895, the Charter list was reduced from 8 to 4 and the list of 1889 remained intact making our total membership in Grand Lodge 8. Sir Josiah Drummond, then Provincial Grand Master, taldng the ground that the status of this Provincial Grand Lodge, with its increase of membership and the position it occupied in the Masonic Fraternity in the United States, entitled us to a larger representation upon the roll of the Grand Lodge, he submitted a list of ten names to the Grand Lodge and requested they be elected and enrolled members of the Grand Lodge, and the request was granted, since which time the list of 1895 has appeared in our Records and Minutes. In 1902 our list of members of Grand Lodge was so reduced by death that there remained but Charter Members 3 of the List of 1889, 3 of the List of 1895, ~ making a total of ii At the meeting that year Sir Josiah Hayden Dmmmond stated that he particularly desired to honor Sir George Mayhew Moulton and Sir Allison Nailor, Jr., and directed the Provincial Grand Secretary to write for him to Grand Lodge making known his request for the election and enrollment of these two Illustrious Brethren to member - ship in Grand Lodge. The death of Brother Dmmmond followed very soon after the meeting and when the Provincial Grand Lodge next met a resolution was passed by unanimous vote requesting the Grand Lodge to elect and enroll Sir James Daniel Richardson to be a mem - ber of Crand Lodge. In due course an official communication was sent to Grand Lodge requesting the desired action on the three names mentioned, and this letter from the Grand Secretary is the reply re - ceived. The letter states that in the cases of Sirs Moulton and Nailor, applications must be signed by them, in the forms enclosed, but no such enclosure was found, and as to our Provincial Grand Master, his position makes his case different, and they agree with us that he should be a member of the Grand Lodge, but they restrict it to be an ex officio member dunng the tern of his Provincial Grand Mastership. The letter 39"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Ii -i concludes that this recommendation would be proposed at the next meeting of Grand Lodge. The letter is dated r6th December, 1903, but no word has since been received from Grand Lodge upon this subject, and we have no knowledge as to what action if any has been taken. The Provincial Grand Secretary was then directed to request the Grand Secretary to kindly inform us as to what action by Grand Lodge has been taken, and to send us the necessary blanks referred to for use in the cases of Sirs Moulton and Nailor, that the present require - ments of Grand Lodge may be complied with. On motion the following was adopted: Resolved, The American Tyler-Keystone, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Masonic Voice Review, of Chicago, Illinois, be considered the official journals of the Royal Order of Scotland. On motion it was declared that the thanks of this Provincial Grand Lodge are due to the Supreme Council for their courtesy in placing the hall in the House of the Temple of the Scottish Rite at the dis - posal of the Royal Order of Scotland. The Provincial Grand Stewaid, Sir Allison Nailor, jr., announced the Annual Dinner would be at the New Willard, on tomorrow eve - ning at 8 o’clock, and requested the Knights to assemble, with their ladies, in the parlors of that hotel at 7.30 p.m. No further business appearing, the Provincial Grand Lodge was closed to assemble again in Twenty-ninth Annual Meeting in the City of Boston, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on Monday the i 7 th day of September, 1906, An. Or. Reg. 593, unless otherwise di - rected by order of the Provincial Grand Master. WM. Oscxa ROOME, R. C. L. T. N. Provincial Grand Secretary. The election of Sirs Richardson, Moulton and Nailor was made on November 7, 1906, making all Honorary Members. In 1906, the Patent of Richardson as Provincial Grand Master for the United States of America was finally signed (~VIay 7, 1906), the lateness being due to the illness of the Earl of Haddington, Coy - emor. Sir John Valentine Ellis, Provincial Grand Mastei of the Mari - time Provinces of Canada and Sir Benjamin Allen, Deputy Provincial 40 Grand Master of the Province of Ontario and Quebec, Canada, were visitois at the 1906 meeting. In 1909, the first visit of a deputation from the Grand Lodge of the Royal Order of Scotland to our Provincial Grand Lodge was ar - ranged. It was an Extraordinary Session held in Washington, D.C. on September 2 7 th, at the House of the Temple, A. & A.S.R. The follow - ing visitors were received: Christopher C. Nisbett, Deputy Governor Lewis A. Hope, Grand Marischal Allan M. Henderson, Grand Treasurer John A. Forrest, Grand Secretary W A. A. Balfour, Junior Grand Guardian A photograph of the Lodge Room at Edinburgh, occupied by the Grand Lodge was presented to our Provincial Grand Lodge in the name of the Grand Lodge in Scotland, which was ordered suitably framed. At the 1909 meeting (Annual) Sir William Henry Ballard, Pro - vincial Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Ontario and Quebec, and Sir John Morison Gibson, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council, A.&A.S.R. of Canada, were received. Samuel Crocker Lawrence of Massachusetts was appointed Deputy Provincial Grand Master to fill the office made vacant by the passing of Sir Henry Palmer. At the passing of Lawrence in 1911, Sir Leon Martin Abbott of Massachusetts was appointed Deputy Provincial Grand Master. In 1913 the fee for admission was raised to $30.00. 4 i I"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE PROVINCIAL GRAND LODGE OF THE UN [TED STATES SINCE 1914 Sir James Daniel Richardson, Provincial Grand Master, died on March 17, 1914 and the Grand Lodge in Scotland was notified. They advised that the Deputy Provincial Grand Master, Sir Leon Martin Abbott should carry on as Acting Provincial Grand Master until a new Provincial Grand Master be nominated and appointed. Abbott was recommended and his Patent, dated November 4, i914, may be found on page 7 of the Proceedings of 1915. No Deputy Provincial Grand Mastei was appointed in 1915 or 1916. At the 1917 meeting General James D. N4cLachlan, Deputy Grand Marischal was a visitor. A letter was received from the Grand Lodge announcing the Right Honorable, The Earl of Kintore as Deputy Grand Master and Governor to succeed Right Honorable, The Earl of Had - dington, deceased. A letter was also received from the Provincial Grand Mastei, Leon Martin Abbott, of Boston, Massachusetts, resigning from the office of Provincial Grand Master. The Provincial Grand Lodge thereupon selected George Mayhew Moulton of Chicago to be recom - mended to the Grand Lodge for appointment as Provincial Grand Mas - ter. It was moved that all members of the Royal Order of Scotland, in the Province of the United States of America, in the mi]itary or naval service of the United States be exempt from the annual tax. On November r6, 19i7, the Grand Lodge acknowledged the receipt of the recommendation that Sir George Mayhew Moulton be appointed Provincial Grand Master of the United States of America. He was appointed and a copy of his Patent, dated March 27, 19i8 is to be found m the 1918 Proceedings. At the 1918 meeting, notice of five waivers granted to naval men in Scotland is made, but only four names are listed. It was voted that all funds of the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Umted States of America be put into the Fourth Liberty Loan bonds. I find no record that this was done, howevei. At the meeting in October 1919, Roome resigned after thirty-three years as Provincial Grand Secretary. It was voted to give him $400 each year, in quarterly installments, during his lifetime. Moulton also re - signed as Provincial Grand Master and George Edgar Corson of the District of Columbia was recommended for Provincial Grand Master. His Patent, dated February 4, 1920, [5 reproduced in the Proceedings. 42 Stirling Kerr of the District of Columbia was appointed Provincial Grand Secretary. At the i922 meeting it was announced that Roome had passed away on Febmary 3, 1922, nearly eighty-three yeais of age. It is noted in the Proceedings that John S. Forest, Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge in Edinburgh; David Reed, Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Scotland; and John Inglis, Grand Master of Knights Templars in Scotland, were in this country to testify in the fraud case against Mat - thew McBlain Thompson in Salt Lake City, Utah. They were enter - tained by officers of the Royal Order in Washington, D.C. on the way home. There is also reproduced a telegram sent to President Warren Harding rn which he is congratulated on being elected to receive the thirty-third degree of the Scottish Rite. His reply is also printed. In the 1923 Proceedings there is a record of the passing of Presi - dent Harding and a notification, dated April 6, 1923, from the Grand Treasurer of the Grand Lodge in Edinburgh that John A. Forrest, Grand Secretary passed away on September 24, 1922. Allan M. Henderson, the Grand Treasurer was appointed to succeed him on July i8, 1923. In 1927 George Edgar Corson, Provincial Grand Master died (July 10, 1927). Samuel Poyntz Cochran of Texas was nominated. There is no Patent reproduced in the Proceedings but at the banquet it is noted that he was elected. Stirling Kerr, the Provincial Grand Secretary died on May 27, 1929 and Lem Towers of the District of Columbia became the Provincial Grand Secretary. In May, 1932, Cochran appointed James Henry Brice of New Yoik as Deputy Provincial Grand Master, after which he resigned and Brice finished his term. Brice was recommended to Scotland for appointment and in 1933 the Grand Lodge advised that he had been conflimed and’ his Patent made and sent. There is no copy of it in the Proceedings. Lem Powers died on March 3, 1933 and Arthur Badley Hayes of the District of Columbia was appointed Provincial Grand Secretary. Because many members were in arrears in the payment of dues the new Provincial Grand Secretary offered a iesolution, which was passed, that all dues of members four years or less in arrears, including the fiscal year 1933, be remitted if and when the members paid their i934 and 1945 dues ($ io.oo). It seems that this action did not have the desired efiect as the receipts in 1933 were only $3,170 and the following year only $2,104. However, in 1935 they jumped to $3,400. 43 I"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"In 1940 a new set of By-laws was adopted.

On June 13, i953, Charles Samson, of Morristown, New Jeisey, was appointed Provincial Grand Secretary and on October 21, 1953, Marvin Edward Fowler, of the District of Columbia was appointed by the Pro - vincial Grand Master to handle the business of the Provincial Grand Lodge. On recommendation he was confirmed by the Grand Lodge in Scotland and on Saturday, August 28, 1954, at a special meeting held in the Hotel Astor in New York City, the Right Honorable, The Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, Deputy Grand Master and Governor of the Royal Order of Scotland, installed Marvin Edward Fowler as Provin - cial Grand Master. So far as I can ascertain, this is the only time that any Piovincial Grand Master of the United Slates Province was ever installed at all. Fowler’s Patent is dated February 3, 1954. It was read at the installation but not printed in the Proceedings. It might be noted that there are no printed Transactions foI the years 1949, 1950, L95i and 1952. On September 27, 1954, Frederick H. Stevens, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the Philippines, A.A.S.R., who was made an Honorary Member on October i8, 1951, was present and his certificate was presented to him.

George Edward Bushnell, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council, Scottish Rite, Northern Juris - diction, was made an Honorary Life Member. A brief history of the Royal Order of Scotland by the head of the Order of Scotland was printed in our Proceedings in 1926. It was ie - peated at least seven times more through 1940.

That no one shall be admitted into the iSth or Rose Crou~ Degree in Scotland under Warrant of the Supreme Council of Scotland, until he shall have been duly admitted a Knight of the Royal Ordei of Scotland.” There follows three additional regulations covering those already in one or the other and how to obtain membership in both and the fees thereunto. This perplexing situation, which existed over a hundred years ago, was questioned by the author to determine the situation today. Brothers George S. Draffen and Robert S. Lindsay had this to say about the matter: When the Supreme Council was started by Dr. Charles Momson in 1845 it was more or less a competitive association. The Royal Order was then more or less “lord of all it surveyed” so far as the so-called high degrees in Scotland were concerned. Consequently, when the Su - preme Council was formed there was quite a bit of competition. It was to avoid that competition that the resolution was duly passed by both bodies. It appears that the resolution was easy to carry out as the Secre- tary of both bodies was the same man. However, when Lindsey Macke - sey passed away in i9o4, the two bodies had different secretaries and it seems that nothing further was done about the resolution. It has not been in force for more than thirty years and when the matter was brought up the Grand Lodge formally declared it to be at an end, a couple of years ago. The latest edition of the Constitutions of the Royal Order of Scot - land piovide that any candidate shall be a Master Mason for five years, 52 S3"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"which is obligatory m all Provincial Grand Lodges.
