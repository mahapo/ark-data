The Holy Bible is given to us to be the rule and guide for our faith and practice. It is dedicated to God, being the last, best, and most inestimable gift from God to man. The Square teaches us to square our actions; it is dedicated to the Master and is the proper Masonic emblem of his office. The Compasses are dedicated to the Craft, for by a due attention to their uses we are taught to circumscribe our desires and to keep our passions within due bonds.

MASTER—Masonry, according to the general acceptation of the term, is an Art founded on the principles of Geometry, and directed to the service and convenience of mankind; but Free - masonry, embracing a wider range, and having a nobler object in view, namely, the cultivation and improvement of the human mind, may, with more propriety, be called a Science, inas - much as, availing itself of the terms of the former, it inculcates the principles of the purest morality, though its lessons are for the most part veiled in allegory and illustrated by symb’ols. To draw aside this veil, therefore, or more properly speaking, to penetrate throughout it, is the object of instructors in Freemasonry, and by a careful and appropriate attention to them we may hope, ultimately, to become acquainted with all its mysteries. The lecture of the Entered Apprentice degree is divided into three sections. Throughout the whole virtue is painted in the most beautiful colors, and the duties of morality are everywhere strictly enforced. The principles of knowledge are imprinted on the memory by lively and sen - sible images well calculated to influence our conduct in the proper discharge of the duties of social life. The mode of Masonic instruction is catechetical. The first section of the lecture pertaining to this degree is a recapitulation of the forms and ceremonies through which you have just passed. It will be necessary for you to commit this lecture to memory and to make known your proficiency therein by examination in open lodge before you can be passed to the degree of a Fellow Craft. You may present yourself for this examination at any of our stated communications on the of each month, or at a communication called for the purpose, but you cannot receive the next degree under twenty-eight days or one lunar month. I will now rehearse this lecture for your benefit with our Brother Senior Deacon. Brother Senior Deacon [or Senior Warden], MASTER—This, my brother, is the lecture of the first section, and that which you will be required to commit to memory. As I said, it is a recapitulation of the forms and ceremonies through which you have just passed. The second section of the lecture rationally accounts for these ceremonies.

But if, by pondering over the allegories and symbols of these degrees, you find the hidden truth, a new world of wisdom. strength and beauty will be revealed to you. You have taken an obligation of secrecy, and, my brother, I am constrained to believe that you will ever essentially keep that vow. For, if you elect to remain a member of that greater class of Masons, you will never, outside the essential modes of recognition in the nature of grips, passwords, etc., have discovered sufficient of the secrets of Masonry to be enabled to reveal them to others; but, should you by industry and perseverance, attain rank among the lesser company you will have attained a quality of mind and purpose that will protect those secrets from all except those duty and truly pre - pared and who come in the same manner as you have traveled. In order to understand the symbols of the three degrees it is necessary for you to know that, broadly speaking, Masonry has come from two general sources. One of these was the societies of stonemasons who flourished in mediaeval times, and who were the builders of those great cathedrals many of which have been so ruthlessly destroyed through the devastations of war. The societies gradually ceased to be bands of operative workers and-~ admitted men not really connected with the actual work of building. By the year 1717 Masonic lodges had become purely speculative. But the working tools of the operative Masons, the square, level, plumb, rule, gavel, etc., were still retained as symbols to teach important truths in character building. We, as Masons, no longer build temples and cathedrals of stone, but we build spiritual temples, temples of character, temples of upright manhood and integrity. The second great source from which Masonry derived its symbolism was the ancient Mysteries. The relation they bear to our order will be unfolded to you as you advance in the degrees. It is only necessary to tell you here that in every ancient nation that attained any degree"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Entered A pprentice 23 preparation should be mental and moral as well as physical. Our order subscribes to no system of religious doctrine, but it requires that every man who presents himself as a candidate for initiation shall declare a belief in one God, all-wish, all powerful, all-good, who reveals Himself to mankind. It also teaches that there is life beyond the grave. The candidate must come of his own free will; must be a man, free born, twenty-one years of age, and his moral qualities must be such as will bear a rigid investigation by a com - mittee of Master Masons appointed for that purpose. Masonry tries to exclude those who come through mere curiosity or through a desire for business or social gain. To be a member of the investigating committee is one of the most serious duties a Mason is called upon to perform, and every candidate deserves careful consider - ation; even then, many duly and truly unprepared make their way into our lodges. Masonry invites no man. He knocks at the door of the lodge of his own free will and accord, having divested himself of everything that would indicate poverty or wealth, rank or station. At the inner door of the preparation room all are equal, and entrance through this door into the lodge room is only granted after the candidate has satisfied all present that he is worthy and well qualified to gain admission, and comes as an earnest seeker for Light and Truth.

The question naturally arises: How could so £tupendous an edifice be erected without the aid of these implements? The stones were hewn, squared and numbered in the quarries where they were procured. The timbers were felled, fitted and prepared in the forests of Lebanon and conveyed in floats by sea from Tyre to Joppa. The metals were fused and cast on the plains of Zeredatha. After which, the whole was conveyed to Jerusalem and there set up by the aid of wooden mauls and implements prepared for that purpose; so that every part fitted with such exact nicety that it resembled the handiwork of the Supreme Archi - tect of the Universe more than that of human hands. inference that our ancient and venerable Insti - tution depends not for its support and perma - nency on any principle of compulsive or coercive force, but is best cemented by the perfect union and harmony of its constituent parts. You were * * * because Masonry regards no man for his worldly wealth or honors, for it is the internal and not the external qualifications of a man that recommend him to become a Mason. Show your light and your power to men, but before God what have you to offer, save in humility? Your robes, your tinsel, and your jewels mean naught to Him, until your own body and soul, gleaming with the radiance of perfection, become the living orna - ments of your lodge. You were * * * in commemoration of the ancient Israelitish manner of confirming a contract. Thus, we read in the Book of Ruth that Boaz having proposed to the nearest kins - man of Ruth that he exercise his legal right by redeeming the land of Naomi, which was offered for sale, and marrying her daughter-in-law, the kinsman, who was unable to do so, resigned his right of purchase to Boaz; and the narrative goes on to say: “Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel. Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, ‘Buy it for thee.’ So he drew off his shoe.” You this evening *** in testimony of the sincerity of learning guarantee admission unless a reputation for generosity, truthfulness and rectitude of conduct be coupled with it.

It is a symbol of the agonies of the first death and of the throes of a new birth. There you stood without our portals, on the threshold of this new Masonic life, in darkness, helplessness, and ignorance. Having been wandering amid the errors and covered over with the pollutions of the outer and profane world, you came inquiringly to our doors, seeking the new birth, and asking a withdrawal of the veil which concealed the divine truth from your uninitiated sight. And here, as with Moses at the burning bush, the solemn admonition is given, “Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Ceremonial preparations surrounded you, all of a signifi - cant character, to indicate to you that some great change was about to take place in your moral and intellectual condition. There was to be not simply a change for the future, but also an extinction of the past; for initiation is, as it were, a death to the world and a resurrection to a new life. And hence it was that among the old Greeks the same word signified both “to die” and ‘to be initiated.” But death to him who believes in immortality is but a new birth. The world is left behind—the chains of error and ignorance which had previously restrained you in moral and intellectual captivity are to be broken—the portal of the Temple of a Future Life has been thrown widely open, and Masonry stands before you in all the glory of its form and beauty, to be fully revealed, how - ever, only when the new birth has been completely accom - plished.[ You were received * * * the moral of which was explained to you at that time. [Secrecy is the first great lesson of the Entered Appren - tice degree. This great virtue is necessary in our order so that Masons will appreciate the lessons taught. As a secret shared between two people binds them together, so the secrets of our fraternity bind the brethren together. If our teachings of beautiful truths weie scattered broad - cast throughout the world, they would become common - place; so they are taught under secrecy, only to those deemed worthy to receive and practice them. Taken with the salt of curiosity and expectation, they are the more readily perceived. Nothing can more torture a man than the pangs of remorse which a guilty constience can force upon him. Sharp instruments may torture the flesh, but unless the torture be unto death a few short days suffice to heal the wounds and only the scars remain to remind of the agony endured. But the torture of a guilty conscience is not so. Memory of pledges violated, evil deeds done, kind actions left undone, comes to us after years have passed; comes to us as we lie upon our beds and chases “sleep, tired Nature’s sweet restorer.” from our eyes, and makea our bed a hell; comes amid our innocent social pleasures and turns our joy to pain; a face, a word or an odor may bring back the hateful incidents of a scene that no subse - quent life of purity and holiness and rectitude of conduct can banish from the memory. Brother, guard well your"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Entered Apprentice [In the light of that lesson, prayer becomes a duty as well as the privilege of every Mason. How few under - stand the nature and effects of prayer. Prayer that has become merely a bedtime custom is not a prayer; it is an incantation to soothe the demands of a habit formed in more innocent and unsophisticated days. The object and effect of prayer are to bring the soul into conscious harmony with the all-wise Father, whose laws are true and just and righteous altogether. “I-fe who has the founta2n of prayer in him will not complain of hazards. Prayer is the recognition of laws: the soul’s exercise and source of strength; its thread of conjunction with them. Prayer for an object is the cajolery of an idol; the resource of superstit2on. There you misread it. We that fight the living world must have the universal for succor of the truth in it. Cast forth the soul in prayer, you meet the effluence of the outer truth, you join with the creative elements giving breath to you. Who rises from prayer a better man, his prayer is answered.”] * * * with safety confide, and also to teach you that you might thence learn as a Mason to practice universal beneficence; to be as eyes to the blind and feet to the lame; that, whenever in your progress through life you should meet with a worthy man, particularly a Mason, in that state of distress, the appearance of which you had then voluntarily assumed, you should stretch forth your right hand of Fellowship to comfort and protect him. [The trust of a Mason is in God. But before a man can trust in God, whom he cannot see, he must learn to trust in his fellowman, who is made in God’s image. As you placed yourself in the hands of this lodge and followed your conductors through the ceremonies of initiation, you exemplified your trust in your fellowman. So ever place your trust in God and walk uprightly through life, fearing no danger; know that a man’s worst enemy is himself, and that with one, God is a majority. He who is in conscience bound to perform an act, to accomplish a purpose or to keep a secret, is bound by ties, though invis2ble, that are stronger than any bonds that could be for ed or contrived by man. The release of the candidate prom the last ties that bind him to the world he has left outside the lodge room, coupled with the reception of light, is a symbol of a new birth, a birth from the darkness of ignorance and superstition to the light of wisdom, toleration, generosity and all other commendable virtues.] You were conducted ** *, following the apparent course of the sun, from the east through the south to the west, and back again, that the brethren might see that you were duly and truly prepared.

Cares and temptations of business and pleasure throw obstacles in the way of men and of nations, and challenge their capability and integrity. Both individuals and nations must overcome obstacles and demonstrate their right to advance to broader fields of usefulness. As seen in the west, the light of the sun is ever a declin - ing gloiy. The east, as the birthplace of the sun and source of light, has always been venerated by primitive peoples. As devout Moslems pray with their faces toward Mecca, the birthplace of their prophet, and as the ancient sun-worshipers bowed to the rising sun, so Masons give the highest place to the east, as the true source of Masonic light, and it is here the Worshipful Master has his station. Hence a Mason travels from west to east on his search for Masonic light, and hence also the regular, upright manner of approaching the east and rendering it due respect.] Having assumed this proper position you then voluntarily * * * Entered Apprentice Mason. lWhile demanding that all Masons yield obedience to the tenets of the order~ Masonry requires no act or belief that will conflict with any of the exalted duties that a man owes to God, his country, his neighbor, his family or himself. Reverence for God, patriotism and brotherly love are so frequently inculcated and so forcibly recom - mended in the lodge that the Mason who does not practice these virtues is recreant to the trust imposed in him by his brethren. Truth being the center of all Masonic teaching and the highest principles of reverence, patiiotism and charity being founded on truth, it follows that he who lives up to the highest principles of Masonic duty will naturally practice all moral, social and religious virtues.] Having voluntarily assumed * * ‘~, you were asked * * ‘~, whereupon you responded, “Light.” [The material light that sprang forth at the fiat of the Great Architect, when darkness and chaos were dispersed, has ever been, in Masonry, a favorite symbol of that intellectual illumination which it is the object of the order to create in the minds of its disciples, whence we have truly assumed the title of “Sons of Light.” This mental illumination—this spiritual light which, after his new birth, is the first demand of the new candidate, is but another name for Divine Truth—which constitutes the chief design of all Masonic teaching. And as the chaos and confusion in which “in the beginning” the earth, without form and void, was enrapt, were dispersed, and order and beauty established by the Supreme command which created material light, so, at the proper declaration and in due and recognized form, the intellectual chaos and confusion in which the mind of the reophyte is in - volved are dispersed and the true knowledge of the science and philosophy, the faith and doctrine of Masonry are developed. Masonic Light is the object of every Mason’s search, King Solomon’s Temple, in which we learn that there were guards stationed at the south, west, and east gates, who suffered none to pass or repass but such as were duly qualified and had their permission.

Light, ever and ever more light; from the first faint perception of thcse Three Great Lights, the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, until he shuffles off this mortal coil, the earnest Mason seeks for Light; seeks in the Holy Bible, that inestimable gift from God to man which is given us as a rule and guide for our faith and practice; seeks in the symbolism of the Square and Compasses; seeks in the great book of Nature: seeks in the hearts and lives of men. If he shall realize that Masonic Light is a symbol for Truth; if he shall see beyond the symbol to the Truth itself, comprehending it by the light of knowledge and wisdom, then the full glory of Masonic Light will shine in his heart and he will go forth to bear the light aloft and let it shine among men.I The Right Hand of fellowship was extended to you because the right hand has in all ages been deemed an emblem of fidelity; our ancient brethren worshiped Deity under the name of Fides, or fidelity, which was sometimes repre - sented by two right hands joined, and sometimes by two human figures holding each other by the right hand. The right hand, therefore, was employed as a token of your sincerity, and as a pledge of our fidelity in the work upon which we were then engaged. You were presented a Lambskin or white leathern apron. The lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence. By the lamb - skin, therefore, the Mason is reminded of that purity of life and conduct which is essential to his gaining admission to the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. to remind you of your own humble condition, both of property and dress, of penury and want, in which you were received into the Lodge, which should make you at all times ‘sensible of the distresses of poverty. [Charity should be a distinguishing characteristic of every Mason. It is in the practice of this virtue that man most nearly reveals his kinship to God. Hear Buddha on the charitable man: “The charitable man is loved by all; his friendship is prized highly; in death his heart is at rest and full of joy, for he suffers not from repentance; he received the opening flower of his reward and the fruit that ripens from it. The charitable man has found the path of salvation. He is like the man who plants a sapling, securing thereby the shade, the ilowers and the fruit in future years. Even so is th~ result of charity, even so is the joy of him who helps those who are in need of assistance.” If the cardinal virtues of Freemasonry, which are Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice, were practiced by all mankind, then charity, as an act ol almsgiving, would cease. For ignorance and intemperance and injustice would be banished from the world, and the woes of misery and penury that follow them would then give place to joy. But the poor we have with us always; so, as we administer our charity let us remember that it is not only those who are in straightened financial circumstances who need our assistance, but that the poor in spirit, the despondent, the discouraged may be heartened and lified up by kind and encouraging words. Let us give bountifully of our love and sympathy to every Brother in distress.I As you must by now understand, it was no material or tangible pledge that was really wanted of you: but that the true pledge of Masonic friendship be deposited ii your heart.

The three great tenets of a Mason’s pro - fession are Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. By the exercise of BROTHERLY LOVE we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family—the high and low, the rich and poor—who, created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid and protect each other.

My particular object in thus addressing you is to prevent your leaving the lodge this evening with any of the mistaken impressions frequently entertained by newly-made Masons. I would not have you go away with the idea that you have been fooled, or that any one portion of the recent ceremony is unmeaning or introduced for the mere purpose of mystification. Freemasoniy is truly a system of morality veiled in allegory, and illus - trated by symbols, and the most apparently trivial inci - dent, both in your preparation and initiation, has its deep and hidden meaning. It is not reasonable to expect that you should at first sight penetrate the outer or allegorical symbol, but I trust you will make it your business, as a Mason, to arrive at these hidden meanings. Another and a most fatal delusion I would guard you against, is that of entertaining the idea that the information im - parted to you this evening has made you a Freemason. After my efforts to impress you with the importance of the ceremony, such a warning from me may create some astonishment in your mind, but what I would imply is, that Masonry is not a mere matter of secret ceremonies, it is something far higher and holier than these. A man may have attained to the highest honors the Craft can bestow and be perfectly up in all its lore and working and yet be as far from being a Freemason as he was before his initiation, and unfortunately there are too many who may r Entered Apprentice 57 be classed in this category. The rites and ceremonies of Freemasonry are essential to its existence—they form the outworks whereby its treasures are, as they ought to be, guarded from the unworthy, and therefore cannot under any circumstances be dispensed with; but true Masonry exists in the heart, and is composed of brotherly love, relief and truth, and that heavenly consummation of all virtues, charity, so beautifully explained in the volume of the sacred law as “bearing all things, hoping all things, believing all things, enduring all things, and thinking no evil,” and it is to the practice of this virtue that your Masonic efforts should ever tend, not only in its common acceptation of pecuniary relief, but as embracing true brotherly love to the full extent inculcated in the sacred writings. Initiation alone never did, nor never can, make a man a true Mason; it gives the key, but the mere pos - session of the key does not constitute ownership of the treasure; it sows the seed, but unlesa the soil be good and carefully cultivated, fruit will not be produced; it opens the portal, but unless the road be traversed the goal cannot be attained; it lays the foundation, but without labor the superstructure cannot be raised. So this even - ing we have given you the key, we have sown the seed, opened the portal, and laid the foundation; it is for you, with such assistance, as amongst Masons can always be obtained by seeking for it in the proper quarter, to com - plete the work, and I sincerely trust that in this you will not be found wanting. Finally, whilst charging you not to undervalue Free - masonry, I will beg you to remember that it is a human institution, and as such necessarily imperfect and liable to error; do not be disheartened (disappointed you naturally will be) if you find some who profess its tenets, but do not act up to its teachings. You will probably frequently hear our noble science ridiculed by the unenlightened world, and stigmatized as a childish mystery, and a pre - tention to superior excellence, covering only secret revels and excesses. Treat such ridicule with contempt, and answer it only by acting up to your profession. A man who ridicules that of which he cannot, by any possibility, know anything, stultifies himself and is unworthy of notice.

It is a mistake to suppose that the apron, as an article of dress, was confined in ancient times to operative masons and other mechanics. On the contrary, it was an indispensable part of the ordinary apparel of the ancient Egyptians of all classes, and was worn by kings, priests and nobles, as well as the common people. ‘The apron of the king was, however, of a peculiar form, which belonged exclusively to his rank.

But before setting out it is well to inform you that this section of the lecture pertaining to this degree has reference to the origin of the institution, and views Masonry under its two denominations—Operative and Speculative—and considers the nature of symbolical instruction. [Masonry is called a progressive science; it may also be defined as a system of morals applicable to life—veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols, and for the more regular advancement in the knowledge of its mysteries ii divided into different classes and degrees. According to the progress we make we limit or extend our inquiries, and in proportion to our capacity therein, we attain to a Ic. or a greater degree of perfection. The two sections of this degree form important parts of the great edifice of Masonry. The first, while purely ceremonial, is designed to lead the mind to a proper consideration of its symbols, which have been so wisely selected, and are so happily designed to inculcate the great lessons of morality and truth. In this, the second section, your attention will be directed to new and more interesting symbols, and I shall endeavor to give you some idea of their Masonic application. The question is frequently asked, “Why does Masonry teach by symbols?” To the student the answer naturally suggests itself.

Thus has Masonry retained this most ancient or primitive method of instruction; and by her symbols appealing to the physical sight seeks to impress upon the heart and mind her great lessons. It is not the ritualistic ceremonies and observances alone that constitute Masonry; they are merely the intro - duction to and the beginning of Masonic life: yet they are of the highest importance; they are to Masonry what the foundation or substructure is to a building. It matters not how beautiful, stately or superb a building may a p pear, if the foundation is too narrow or its construction faulty, the building will be defective and its permanency doubtful; if the rendition of the ritual is faulty or expressionless, its beauty is marred, and favorable impiession upon the novitiate so necessary to translate its symbolic meaning into an intelligible appreciation of its beautiful teachings may fail of realization. The ritual accurately and impres - sively rendered may prove to be a potent factor in incit ing higher ideals and in fashioning his life in conformity with the principles expressed or implied in our beautiful symbolism. To you, my brother, the gauge, gavel, square, level and plumb should no longer be merely the working tools of an operative mason’s art, but visible, tangible emblems of great moral truths and duties. There are two kinds of Masonry—Operative and Speculative.[ We work as Speculative Masons only, but our ancient brethren wrought in both Opera - tive and Speculative Masonry. They worked Fellow Craft 73 at the building of King Solomon’s Temple, and many other sacred and important edifices. By OPERATIVE MASONRY we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of archi - tecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts. [It furnishes us with dwellings and with convenient shelter from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons, and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary, and beneficent purposes.] The Operative Mason directs his labors to the construction of material edifices composed of stone, brick and mortar, which like all things temporal must sooner or later succumb to the inevitable ravages of time. By SPECULATIVE MASONRY we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. [It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative Mason to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator.] The Speculative Mason, therefore, is a moral builder for eternity, fitting immortal nature for that spiritual building which shall exist when 72 Fellow Craft N"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"74 Fellow Craft Fellow Craft 75 labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of creation and to adore their great Creator. [Before the Almighty was pleased to command this vast world into existence, the elements and materials of creation lay mixed together without distinction or form. Darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, “Let there be light!” and there was light. And God, as an example to man, that all things of moment should be done with due deliberation, was pleased to be six days in commanding it from chaos to perfection. The Almighty, having finished the six days’ work, rested on the seventh. He blessed, hallowed, and sancti - fled it. He thereby taught man to work industriously six days, but strictly commanded him to rest on the seventh, the better to contemplate the beautiful works of creation—to adore him as their Creator—to go mt his sanctuaries, and offer up praises for life and every blessing he so amply enjoys at His bountiful hands.[ It was the custom of our ancient brethren to assemble on the evening of the sixth day of each week in the Middle Chamber of King earth’s proudest monumental piles shall have crumbled in dust, and the glory and greatness of earth shall have been forgotten. This section of the lecture of this degree also refers to the origin of the Jewish Sabbath, as well as the manner in which it was kept by our ancient brethren. [“When the vast sun shall veil his golden light Deep in the gloom of everlasting night, When wild, destructive flames shall wrap the skies, When ruin triumphs, and when nature dies; Man, alone, shall the wreck of worlds survive, ‘Mid falling spheres immortal man shall live.”] Our ancient brethren worked six days and received their wages; they did not work on the seventh day, for in six dayB God created the heavens and the earth, and rested upon the seventh day; the seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"76 Fellow Craft Fellow Craft 77 [It has been supposed that Solomon, in erecting these Pillars, had reference to the Pillar of Cloud and the Pillar of Fire which went before the Israelites in the wilderness, and that the right hand, or south pillar, represented the pillar of Cloud, and the left hand, or north pillar, repre - sented that of Fire. Solomon did not erect them simply as ornaments to the Temple, but as memorials of God’s repeated promises of support to his people of Israel. For the Pillar “Jachin,” derived from the Hebrew words “Jah,” meaning “Jehovah,” and “achin,” “to establish,” signifies that “God will establish his house in Israel”: while the Pillar “Boaz,” compounded of “b,” meaning “in,” and “oaz,” “strength,” signifies that “in strength shall it be established.” And thus were the Jews, in passing through the porch of the Temple, daily reminded of the promises of God, and inspired with confidence in his protection and gratitude for his many acts of kindness to his chosen people.] These Pillars were of brass, cast in the plain of Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredatha, about thirty-five miles in a northeast direction from Jerusalem, where all of the vessels for King Solomon’s Temple were cast by Hiram Abif. They were each eighteen cubits high, twelve in circumference, and four in diameter. They were cast hollow, four fingers’ or a hand’s breadth in thickness; they were cast hollow, the better to serve as safe repositories for the archives of Masonry against all conflagrations and inundations. Above each Pillar, and covering its upper portion to a depth of half a cubit, was a great oval-shaped body, or CHANTER, five cubits in height. Springing out from the Pillar, at the junction of the chapiter with it was a row of lotus petals, or water-lily of the Nile, which, first spreading around the chapiter, afterwards curved downwards towards the Pillar, some - thing like the acanthus leaves on the capital of the Corinthian column. About two-fifths of the distance from the body of the chapiter, or just below its most bulging part, a tissue of network was carved, which extended over its whole upper surface. To the bottom of this network were suspended a series of fringes, and on these again were carved two rows of pomegranates, one hundred being in each row. The Lily, by its extreme whiteness and the retired situation in which it grows, denotes Peace; the Network, by the intimate con- Solomon’s Temple, there to receive their wages as Fellow Crafts. Their way thither led through a long porch or passage of the Temple, at the outer entrance of which were placed two large columns, or PILLARS, which you see here represented, and which you will find in all regular and well-furnished lodges of Fellow Crafts, one on the right, or south, called Jachin, and the other on the left, or north, called Boaz. The Masonic symbolism of these two Pillars may be taken as two-fold. First, in reference to the names of the Pillars, they are symbols of the Strength and Stability of the Institution; and then in reference to the ancient Pillars of Fire and Cloud, they are symbolic of our dependence on the superintending guidance of the Great Architect of the Universe, by which alone that Strength and Stability are secured."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"78 Fellow Craft Fellow Craft nection of its parts, denotes Unity; and the Pomegranates, by the exuberance of their seeds, denote Plenty. To us the Chapiters speak of that unity which should ever distinguish our fraternity, encouraging us to live in peace and harmony with each other and with all men, and, from our store, to give to those less fortunate, but worthy. These Chapiters, being globular, were thought to represent the Terrestrial and Celestial Spheres, indicating life on earth and the life celestial. But this idea is now more clearly conveyed in these representations of those ancient Pillars by the addition of these two large Globes, with their accompanying markings. THE GLOBES are two artificial, spherical bodies, on the convex surfaces of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other particulars. we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and his works, and are induced to en - courage the studies of Astronomy, Geography, and Navigation, and the arts dependent upon them, by which society has been so much benefited. They also denote the universality of Masonry, and teach us that a Mason’s charity should be equally as extensive. Between the Pillars you discover a Check - ered Pavement, indicating the uncertain, checkered and devious course of our physical existence. Beyond the Checkered Pavement you behold a FLIGHT OF WINDING STAIRS leading to a place representing the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple. The only allusion to it in Scripture is to be found in the sixth chapter of the First Book of Kings, and is in these words: “The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house; and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.” This flight of stairs, my brother, is a grand philosophical myth, whose rugged steps are symbols of stages of instruction, and our la - borious ascent symbolizes our struggles to reach the summit of knowledge, where alone the craftsman can receive his reward—the Divine Word—the Truth. These stairs consist of Three, Five, and Seven Steps.

THE FIRST THREE STEPS allude particu - larly to the organization of our institution into the three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason; they also allude to the three principal officers of the lodge, the Wor. shipful Master, the Senior Warden, and Junior Warden; also to the three principal stages of human life, Youth, Manhood, and Old Age— that Youth, the springtime of life, “when the heart puts forth the tender leaves of hope” and gladdens us with its fresh expectancy; Manhood, the summer, when those leaves, matured, load us with their blushing honors; Old Age, the autumn, with chilling frosts, scattering the sear and yellow leaves which fall rustling to the ground. By Order in Architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a build - ing, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. As in painting the judicious selection of colors and the proper blending of light and shade make up the finished picture, so in architecture, the regular disposition of the base, shaft, capital, architrave, frieze, and reason that the worshiper, commencing his ascent with the right foot, would find the same foot forward on entering the temple, which they considered a fortunate omen.

From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more im - proved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. THE TUSCAN is the simplest of all the orders, and its massive strength is capable of supporting the heaviest burdens. It is compared to a sturdy laborer dressed in homely attire. It is used principally in the most solid structures, where the triglyphs and mutules of the Doric, the cyma and encarpus of the Ionic, and the volutes, dentals, and modillions of the Corinthian would be super. fluous. When they began to adorn the Tuscan it lost its individuality and merged into the Doric Rustic cinctures are sometimes represented in the shaft of this column to represent its rustic simplicity. THE DoRIc was invented by the Greeks in the reign of Dorus, and in its bold and massive proportions and comparative want of ornament, it stands essentially dis - tinct from the preceding order. Its origin is derived from the rustic buildings of the primitive Greeks, having triglyphics in the frieze to represent the ends of the joists, and mutules in the cornice to represent rafters. In the Doric the column consists of the shaft and capital, the base being omitted, owing to the peculiar circumstances attending the invention of the column by the lonians. In building a temple to Apollo they wished to use columns, but not knowing the proportions which would combine sufficient strength and symmetry of form, they measured the length of the human foot, and finding it to be the sixth part of a man’s height, they adopted this proportion for their columns, making the thickness of the shaft at the bottom the sixth part of its height. Hence, the Doric imitates the strength and simplicity of man, and is particu - larly well adapted for columns erected to commemorate great events, or the deeds of heroic men, Soon after, wishing to build a temple to Diana, they used the proportions of a woman, from a similar principle, making the thickness of the column the eighth part of its height, and for the first time in architecture gave the colrrn~n a base, using moldings to represent the shoe, and in the capital, volutes to represent the braids of the hair, dropping to the right and left, and the cynlatium and encarpus for the locks disposed on the forehead. They also made flutings in the shaft to represent folds in the dress, The order thus invented they called THE IONIC. This order in its proportions stands for equipoise between the quiet simplicity of the Doric and the elegance of the Corinthian, between the severe and the effeminate, and is well adapted for colleges, libraries, and other build - ings devoted to the arts and letters. So, too, THE CORINTHIAN took its origin from the oesrre of the Greeks to imitate the proportions of the human body, as the Doric imitated the boldness and the simplicity of man and the Ionic the neatness and elegance of the sedate matron. In the 60th Olympiad, 540 years before the Christian era, Callimachus, an Athenian sculptor, invented the Corinthian order, and was indebted for his design to the following remarkable circumstances: An Athenian virgin died and was buried. Upon her tomb her nurse placed a basket containing the toys which pleased her most when living, and to protect them from the open air she covered the basket with a tile. The basket she placed upon an acanthus root.

THE FIVE STEPS also denote the five senses of human nature, which are Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling and Tasting. [The proper use of these Five Senses enables us to form just and accurate notions of the operations of nature; and when we reflect on the objects with which our senses are gratified, we are enabled to attend to them until they become familiar objects of thought, and we become conscious of the infinite depth of love manifested by the Creator towards the creatures of I-us creation.l Of these senses, Hearing, Seeing, and Feeling have always been highly revered by Masons, for by Hearing we hear the word, by Seeing we see the sign, and by Feeling we feel the token whereby one brother may know another in the darkness as well as in the light. You will now ascend the Five steps, com - mencing this time with the left foot, where we left off. My brother, this division, unlike the other two, has in this degree but one signification, that of knowledge in general. In the seventh century, and in fact for a long time afterwards, the circle of instruction to which all of the learning of the most distinguished philosophers growth hy the tile convolved at the extremities in the form of volutes. Callimachus, passing, observed the monument and the delicate foliage growing around it, was pleased with the novelty of the form and made some columns from this model; and thence distributed the proportions of the Corinthian order in all their beauty, imitating the delicacy of virgins in its proportions, and their gaiety and gaudiness of dress in its ornaments. The Corinthian is peculiarly adapted to the decoration of theaters, palaces, and other places devoted to festivity and mirthful assemblages THE CoMrosrTE is a union of the parts of all the orders. It is an invention of the Romans, who meant it, as is supposed, for a proud and enduring monument of their dominion over nations, the inventors of the orders of which this is composed.l These ancient and original orders are most revered by Masons—the Ionic we Masonically term the column of Wisdom, because it wisely combines the proportions of strength and grace.

These were divided into two branches—the Trivium and the Quadrivium. The Trivium included Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic; and the Quad - rivium, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. The word Trivium was derived from the old Latin and signified a place where three roads met. Quadrivium means a place where four roads meet, or as we say, a “cross roads,” hence the origin of the term, the “paths of learning.” These seven heads were sup - posed to include universal knowledge, and he who was master of these was thought to have no need of a preceptor to explain any books or to solve any of the problems that come within the compass of human reason. The Trivium has furnished him with a key to all language, and the Quadrivium has opened to him all the secret laws of Nature. At a time when few were instructed in the Trivium and very few studied the Quadrivium, to be master of both was sufficient to complete one’s character as a philosopher. The propriety, therefore, of adopting the seven Liberal Arts and Sciences as symbolic of the last stage of human learning is apparent, and although all of the beautiful and instructive lessons of this lecture should be carefully absorbed by the mind, particularly so should the symbolism of these SEVEN STEPS, representing Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arith - metic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy. ~GRAMMAR teaches the proper arrangement of words, according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people; and that excellency of pronunciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeably to reason and correct usage. RHETORIC teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not with propriety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance, wisely contriving to captivate our hearers by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it he to entreat or exhort to ad - monish or applaud. LoGrc teaches us to guide our reason discretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce, and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted, or granted; and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning, and disposing, all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally determined, This science ought to be culti - vated as the foundation or groundwork of our inquiries, particularly in the pursuit of these sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons. ARITHMETIC, which is the science of computing by numbers, is absolutely essential, not only to a thorough knowledge of all mathematical science, but also to a proper pursuit of our daily vocations. To the speculative Mason it teaches that we should always endeavor to add to our knowledge, never substract anything from the charac - ter of our neighbor, multiply our benevolence to our fellow- creatures, and divide our means with a suffering brother.l GEOMETRY, or the application of Arithmetic to sensible quantities, is of all sciences the most important.

ASTRONOMY is that sublime science which inspires the contemplative mind to soar aloft and read the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the Great Creator in the heavens. How nobly eloquent of the Deity is the ce - lestial hemisphere I—spangled with the most magnificent heralds of his infinite glory!

Seven long years and a half, midst a silence, unbroken by the sound of an iron tool, they toiled on Mount Moriah in the erection of a monument to the living God. All the beauty of design and the elegance of embellishment known to science and art were employed in its construc - tion, and when the work was done, Architecture was beggared, but the Temple stood, a worthy habitation for the Shekinah, and a glorious monument to the genius of operative Masonry. r Fellow Craft culminated in speculative Masonry, a system which, entering into abstruse investigations of the soul, reminds us of a higher and better life, and eternity beyond the grave; a profound Science that takes from the operative Art its technical terms, its implements and its rules, clothes them in symbolism and teaches the speculative Mason their spiritual use. Thus Freemasonry comes to us from the Temple, an operative Art combined with speculative Science. The language and implements of the artisan are used for the inculcation of the doctrine of pure ethics. It makes no profession of Christianity, and wars not against sectarian creeds or doctrines, but looks forward to the time when the labor of our ancient brethren shall be symbolized by the erection of a spiritual temple whose moral grandeur shall be commensurate with civilization; A temple in which there shall be but one altar and but one worship; one common altar of Masonry, on which the Veda, Shastras, Sade, Zend-Avesta, Koran, and Holy Bible shall lie untouched by sacrilegious hands, and at whose shrine the Hindoo, the Persian, the Assyrian, the Chaldean, the Egyptian, the Chinese, the Mohammedan, the Jew, and the Christian may kneel and with one united voice celebrate the praises of the Supreme Architect of the Universe.] We now approach Brother Senior Warden, who guards the inner door to the Middle Chamber and who will demand of us * * * * *1 S.

The ancient philosophers , laced such a high estimate upon this science that all who frequented the groves of the Sacred Academy were compelled to explore its heavenly paths, and no one whose mind was unexpanded by its precepts was intrusted with the instruction of the young. Even Plato, justly deemed the first of the philosophers, when asked as to the probable occupation of Deity, replied, He geometrizes continually. If we consider the symmetry and order which govern all the works of creation, we must admit that geometry pervades the universe. If, by the aid of the telescope, we bring the planets within the range of our observation, and by the miscroscope view particles too minute for the eye, unaided, to behold, we find them all pursuing the several objects of their creation in accordance with the fixed plan of the Almighty.] By Geometry we may curiously trace nature through her various windings to her most con - cealed recesses. By it we may discover how the planets move in their respective orbits and demonstrate their various revolutions; by it we account for the return of the seasons and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye; by it we discover the power, the wisdom and the goodness of the Great Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect the vast machine. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse and are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature. Is there not more r Fellow Craft 99 truth than fiction in the thought of the ancient philosopher, that God geometrizes continually? [By the geometry he rounds the dewdrop; points the pyramidal icicle that hangs from thatch - bound roof; bends into a graceful curve the foaming cataract; paints his bow of beauty upon the canvas of a summer shower; assimilates the sugar to the diamond, and in the fissures of the earth.bound rocks forms gorgeous caverns, thick - set with starry gems. By it he taught the bee to store its honey in prismatic cells; the wild goose to range her flight, and the noble eagle to wheel and dart upon its prey, and the wakesome lark, God’s earliest worshiper, to hymn its matin song in spiral flight. By it he forms the tender lens of the delicate eye, rounds the blushing cheek of beauty, curves the ruby lips and fashions the swelling breast that throbs in unison with a gushing heart. By it he paints the cheek of autumn’s mellow fruit, forms in molds of graceful symmetry the gentle dove, marks the myriad circles on the peacock’s gaudy train, and decks the plumage of ten thousand ..warblers of his praise that animate the wooded shade. By it he fashions the golden carp, decks the silvery perch, forms all fish of every fin and tribe that course the majestic ocean, cut the placid lake or swim in gentle brook.

Hal Riviere, Georgia.) (As we look about th[s world in which we live and consider the various forms of [ife with which we are familiar, we find a sameness in the general plan that would be monotonous if it were not so beautiful in the infinite variety of the details. The life of a world, the Life of a race, of a nation, a man, an animal, a flower, an insect—each of these goes through the same relative processes, a process from beginning to end, and as they pass beyond it seems likely that those processes are repeated. First, there is the period of preparation, then the birth, the growth, the fruiting time, the decline, and, finally, the dissolution. For countless ages a fragment clings to its sun—a world in preparation; eventually it is thrown whirling into space to begin a separate existence—the birth of a world; the gases solidify, land and water appear—the period of development; vegetable and animal life are brought forth —the period of fruitfulness; then come decline and dis - solution. A tiny seed lies in the ground; it bursts and the sprout makes its way to the top of the soil and a plant is born; it grows and, flowering, sheds a sweetness abroad and gives useful fruit; b~~t ita work done, it, too, fades and dies. Whence caine the plant and whither has it gone? It knows not, nor cares. From a tiny egg in the waxen cell within the hive a larva is hatched, passes through the various stages of development until eventually the bee comes forth to perform its amazing, complicated series of duties; finally, with frayed wings worn out in gathering the nectar from a myriad of blossoms, it crawls away to die alone. Whence Thls lecture is too long for use upon tbe occasion of the conferment of the degree but 18 of jmmeahurable value in the endeavor to impa~ a proper knowledge of the teachlng8 of ~he Fellow Craft degree.

It knows not, nor cares. After a suitable period of preparation a babe is born, grows to manhood, does his work whether of good or ill, declines and dies. Whence came the man and whither has he gone? Man knows not, but cares, and the question that he has ever asked himself from the time when the first gleams of intelligence were developed in him is, “Whence came you?” and later, “Whither are you travel - ing?” Perha s the first question a child will ask upon seeing a new-torn infant is, “Where did he come from?” Later, as he comes to realize the meaning of death, he will ask, “Where do the dead go?” For there is in sian- kind a feeling that death does not end it all and he has ever refused to concede to death the victory, feeling rather that human life is a preparation for a greater life to come beyond the grave. Two stages of human life have everbeenawe-.iiispiriiig— Infancy and Old Age; the infant, a candidate for the mysteries of this world, and the old man, a candidate for the mysteries beyond the grave. Whence comes the infant, from the everywhere or nowhere? Who can stand beside the cradle of a babe only a few days old and see it smile in its sleep without feeling that it has had an experience? It has no consciousness of the present world; then whence its smile? Can there still be memories of the everywhere it has left before the experience of this world crowds them out? What possibilities lie before it during the few years it is to spend in this life! Who knows the consequences that may hang upon the use it makes of the opportunities of human existence! And so it is that Old Age also, facing the end of human existence, facing a journey into undiscovered countries, fills the contemplative mind with serious thoughts. If there be sleeping and dreaming in that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns, will the dreams that shall come to him newly-born to the heavenly life cause sweet smiles to play across his radiant face and bear witness to the beauty and happiness of a useful mortal life? r Fellow Craft 107 It is only by realizing that human life is a preparation for a greater life beyond, that he has lived befole and shall live again alter death ends mortal existence, it is only by so realizing that one can understand the signifi. canceof Freemasonry because it is an epitome of human life and each degree teaches the duties of certain stages of life, using the customs of the Ancient Operative Masons as a foundation and teaching great moral and intellectual lessons by means of allegories and symbols. When we speak of our Ancient Operative brethren we allude to those men who composed the lodges of stone - masons who built the cathedrals, abbeys, temples and national and civic edifices prior to the seventeenth cen - tury. But those men were not merely stonemasons; their leaders were architects and master builders and possessed that secret knowledge of the building arts which they guarded among themselves and taught only to those proven worthy. Operative Masons have plied their art in the building of many famous structures from the dawn of civilization in Egypt, and we have records of many distinguished Master builders. The first architect to erect a building of stone was Imhotep the wise, who completed his initial work about the year 3000 B. C. A few years later, in 2900 B. C., the architects of King Khufu built the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, an undertaking which demonstrates upon the part of those men a knowledge of arithmetic, geometry and astronomy marvelous to contemplate. Egypt became the fountain head of knowledge and as the secrets of the builders’ arts were jealously guarded by those learned in architecture and the correlated arts and sciences, men of other nations journeyed thither to be initiated into the mysteries. Those found worthy were so initiated, spread abroad to ply their trade and became the teachers and builders of other nations. Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia, Crete and later Greece and Rome, felt the influence of Egyptian civilization. Next to the Pyramids, the most famous structure of ancient times was the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem. This was built by men of Phoenicia headed by Hiram the 106"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"108 Fellow Craft Architect, whom Hiram, King of Tyre, sent to supervise the work for his friend and ally, Solomon, King of Israel. It is comparatively easy to trace the progress of the Art of Architecture from that day until modern times In company with that progress went oath-bound secret societies guarding the knowledge of the builders’ arts anrl torlay we find Speculative Masonry as the direct descendant of those old secret societies of builders. The knowledge of Architecture once so closely guarded in oath-bound fraternities has become the common property of all who care to learn it. Lodges of Operative Masons have ceasetl to exist, but Speculative Masonry has attached a symbolic meaning to the various working tools and to many words, terms and expressions used by the Ancient brethren. As the lessons of Speculative Masonry are taught so largely in terms of the practices of the Ancient Operative Masons a few words as to their customs will make it easier to draw a parallel between those practices and tIre ceremonies of this degree. In ancient times when a person desired to become a Mason he made application to some Master who, if he was pleased with the applicant’s appearance, took him on trial. The trial satisfactory, he was formally Entered as an Apprentice, that being his Masonic birth. Entered Apprentices were required to serve for seven years, that being a period of growth or development, and during that time they learned the fundamental principles of the Craft: obedience, sobriety, truthfulness, industry and consideration for and charity toward the brethren; they learned to adjust themselves to their surroundings and to work in harmony with those about them, meanwhile catching a vision of the seriousness of life and the beauty anti (lignity of their calling. Each was expected to become fixe(l in the habits of right living, skillful in the handling of his tools, familiar with the labors of a stonemason and ambitious to advance. The time of apprenticeship drawing to a close he worked upon and perfected a master - piece as an evidence of his skill, which he carried before the Annual Assembly, where he was required to stand an Fellow Craft 109 examination to demonstrate to his superiors his ability and his worth; upon the result of the examination depended his advancement. In our time, my brother, Free and Accepted Masons carry out many of the ancient customs You were initi - ated as an Entered Apprentice, served a suitable time as such, passed a satisfactory examination before the lodge, were elected to advance and have been passed to the degree of Fellow Craft. But I wonder if during the days of your apprenticeship, you became proficient in the use of the working tools of an Entered Apprentice. You remember that they are the twenty-four-inch gauge, or rule, and the gavel, or mallet. Our Ancient Operative brethren used the gauge to measure or lay out their work. You, my brother, should use your mind or reason to measure your work as you labor in the building of a beautiful character. During your apprenticeship have you used your reason to measure yourself, your conduct, your usefulness, your capacity for service? Do you measure up to the high standard of upright moral and Masonic manhood? We are not enough in the habit of so measuring ourselves, but it is only by so doing that we can lieep our characters straight. But it is not enough for one to measure himself; a man may measure and measure, yet accomplish nothing. Shakespeare says, “Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, looking before and after, gave us not that capability and God-like reason to fust in us unused.” That is the great point—to use our faculties. As our Ancient Operative brethren used the gavel to knock off the corners of rough stones, so we are to use our will power to divest ourselves of the vices and imperfections of our characters. Have you so used your will power? Is there any fault, any imperfection, any vice that yo~ have resol~’ed to forsake since you became a laborer amoung us~ Remember, “You will be what you will to be; Let failure find its false content In that poor word environment, But spirit scorns it and is free.

Its purpose is not dis - cerned and there seems to be no connection between it and the other two degrees of the Blue Lodge. In reality, the three degrees of Freemasonry form a beautiful system and the Fellow Craft is the only logical connecting link between the other two; but it is only when a view of the whole is taken that one comes to see the necessary place in the scheme that each degree occupies. We must bear in mind that Masonic Light is the object of a Mason’s search and that Masonic Light is a symbol for Truth; we must know that in trying to answer the question of his origin and destiny man has come to realize that there are certain laws that govern him. These he has specified as Divine Truth and it is to know and to bring himself into conscious harmony with them that he labors. r Fellow Craft 111 of thought whence result keen judgment, foresight, prudence —all those qualities which go to malce a wise man. “Wisdom,” said Solomon, “is the principal thing; there - fore get wisdom.” Wisdom might be defined as Virtue plus Knowledge multiplied by Contemplation. Its attain - merit is of slow process, a matter of growth. Wisdom is the border-land from whose heights a man beholds Truth, while Truth is the land of Canaan which a Moses may behold yet never fully attain. The forindation of Wisdom is Character. It is in the building of character that every Fellow Craft is employed and this degree deals particularly with the training of the body in right habits and the cultivation of the mind. The legend of this degree presents the matter in beautiful, logical form and should leave no doubt in the mind of the candidate that the ways of virtue are beautiful and that knowledge is attained by degrees. Let us ever remember that it is not the purpose of Freemasonry to enter into scientific dissertations upon Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling and Tasting; by entering such a maze the lessons of the degree are lost Only architects and delvers into antiquity care to entei minutely into the history of the various Orders of Archi - tecture or to learn with mathematical exactitude the proportion of the several columns. Nor is it the purpose of tire Order to define Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arith - metic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy. Such learned (lisqilisitions upon the Senses, Orders of Architecture and the Liberal Arts and Sciences are a relic of the bygone (lays of Operative Masonry when the lodge was workshop, home and school—in fact, the whole life of the brethren; such practices were then advisable and necessary, but in nur time the object in view is to learn practical lessons from a symbolical presentation of those subjects. The proper development and irse of the five human senses enables us to support and protect ourselves, to enjoy the blessings and comforts of life that surround us and to contribute to the happiness of others. Their improper use may lead to animalism on the one hand or asceticism on the other; in either case it will tend to 110 Fellow Craft “It masters time, it conquers space, It cows that boastful trickster, chance, And bids the tyrant circumstance Uncrown and fill a servant’s place. “The human will, that force unseen, The offspring of a deathless soul, Can hew a way to any goal Though walls of granite intervene. “Be not impatient at delay But wait as one who understands, When spirit rises and commands, The gods are ready to obey.” One of our beautiful charges opens with these words “The ways of Virtue are beautiful; Knowledge is attained by degrees; Wisdom dwells with contemplation; there must we seek her.” In those words we have expressed the degree plan of Freemasonry. Man has found that in striving to attain Divine Truth a foundation of good habits is necessary—a training in the ways of virtue; these good habits are used in the acquisition of knowledge or the development of the intellect; a combination of good habits and high intellect,cal development produces a lofty train"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"112 Fellow Craft Fellow Craft 113 From the Orders of Architecture we should learn that an absolute mastery of the details pertaining to his particu - lar line of work is necessary for a man’s success; and as these orders are used to beautify and adorn as well as to be of service, we should not be satisfied with building merely an upright character, but should cultivate those graces that are so pleasing when naturally and sincerely displayed. As the ionic column, emblematic of Wisdom, bears a mean proportion between the ornamental and solid orders, so our characters should preserve the mean between a sordid, mechanical existence and artistic temperamentalism. The acquisition of knowledge and the training of the mind into habits of logical thought is no less a part of character building than the training of the body. The study of the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences is typical of that intellectual development that is necessary before wisdom can be attained and the blending of the beautiful and pleasing arts with the useful sciences teaches us that something more than utility is required in the well rounded character. One may reason logically in ungrammatical language, but if his speech be polished by the use of cor - rect grammatical constructions and adorned by the use of rhetorical figures, his reasoning and personality are given an added force. While the training of the mind to a higher degree in the mathematical sciences is desira. hle, it is not sufficient in a well-developed character, for one so trained may become coldly precise unless a love for the beautiful enters in to temper his exactitude. If in studying astronomy a man becomes so engrossed ~ ith the lines, angles, circles and distances of the heavenly bodies that he perceives none of the beauty of the handi - work of the Great Architect nor hears the “music of the spheres,” he is one of those who, having eyes to see, see not, and having ears to hear, hear not. systematic thought; it is organized knowledge, while art is skill in the employment of the principles of a science. One should cultivate a due regard for all phases of intel - lectual activity, remembering that perfection in any art or calling will come in the degree that knowledge of it is systematic and orderly. A Fellow Craft should not be content to perform his duty in a mechanical way, but should learn the underlying scientific principles upon which it is based, thus becoming an artist instead of a laborer; his daily toil a joy instead of a task, and his life a blessing and inspiration to those who come in contact with him. Realizing that man is a builder engaged in the erection of a temple of character fit for the indwelling of the living God, Freemasonry uses the Temple of Solomon as a type to visualize the processes of building and to illustrate the end in view. Now that you have been passed to the degree of Fellow Craft, the account of the building of this Temple as recorded in the Bible will be of peculiar interest to you. Many traditions in regard to the Temple have been handed down to us, one of the most beautiful being the legend of the Fellow Craft degree. This legend is founded upon a verse in the sixth chapter of I ICings, which is in these words: “The door for the Middle Chamber was in the right side of the house and they went up by winding stairs into the Middle Chamber and out of the Middle into the Third.” We must not confuse history and tradition. Eighty thousand men would find it impossible to ascend to the second story of a building in one afternoon and receive their wages nor would the room contain the wages due them. This incident is of value to us as Masons only in so far as we see the lessons designed to be taught and make practical use of them in the development of our characters. After faithfully performing his duty the ancient Fellow Craft was invested with certain woids, signs and tokens that secured his admission into the Middle Chamber, where he received the wages due him. A shirker or an imposter might ascend the stairs, but only he who wa~ duly prepared by being in possession of these words, signs and tokens could gain admission. limit the capabilities. Overindulgence and excesses tend to blunt and asceticism to dwarft the bodily powers while the reward for moderation and simplicity in the em - ployment of the senses is certain and sure.

He cannot hope to enter the circle of those who have labored and earned the wages due who displays no token that by earnest effort he has earned his reward. Man must give equal value for what he receives. He must pay the price. So also, the laborer is worthy of his hire. Solomon gave the workers upon the Temple a wage of Corn, Wine and Oil. These, being emblematic of nourishment~ refreshment and joy, indicate that the honest, earnest effort receives not only a material wage, but that there should be a wage of satisfaction and joy in the perfor - mance of duty without which a man labors in vain and spends his strength for naught. He who finds no joy in his work has not received the full wages of a Fellow Craft. wound the pride or tear the heart yet will he receive its message humbly, gladly. “Man, know thyself,” is a goal gained sooner through experience in the ways of adversity than by resting on flowery beds of ease or through the lying tongue of flattery. And now, my brother, that you have attained the Middle Chamber and stand in the strength of manhood to receive the reward of a faithful workman, remember that it is not by your own strength alone that you have attained this position, but by the assistance and guidance of the Great Architect of the Universe. “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord.” All the labor you have expended and all the efforts you have put forth in the development of your character have been to the end that you might attain the wisdom to know the will of God concerning you and to make of yourself a temple fit for the indwelling of the Most High. The true Mason is essentially a religious man, fearing God and keeping his laws, and reverence for his holy name should be a distinguishing characteristic of all who have gone this way. Let no profanity or irreverence for His Holy Name bring discredit upon your profession as a Mason.] There are three things that Fellow Craft should value highly and treasure as precious jewels; an attentive ear, an instructive tongue and a faithful breast. The attentive ear symbolizes that earnest desire for knowledge, that openness of mind, that willingness to learn that keeps a man young in spite of his years. No quality is more valuable than that of finding the instructive tongue in all the experiences of life, hearing its message and treasuring that message within the repository of a faithful breast.

As Entered Apprentices we were received among Masons in a state of blindness and desti - tution, emblematical of the entrance of all men upon this their mortal state of existence, when, weak and helpless, they are necessarily depen - dent upon others for protection and life. It inculcated the striking lessons of natural equality and mutual dependence. It taught us to seek the solace of our own distresses in the active principles of universal beneficence and charity, and to extend relief and consolation to our own fellow creatures in the hour of affliction. It enabled us to free the soul from the dominion of pride and prejudice; to look beyond the narrow limits of particular institutions, whether civil or religious, and to review in every member of the human race a brother of the dust. Above all, it taught us to bend with humility and resignation to the Great Architect of the Uni - verse; to dedicate our hearts, thus purified from every malignant passion, to his glory and the good of our fellow creatures, and to prepare ourselves for the reception of truth and wisdom. The degree concluded with the admonition that from earth we came and to it we all must soon again return.

The secrets of nature and the principles of moral truth were thus unveiled before us. We learned the just estimate of those wondrous faculties with which God has endowed the beings formed after his own image, and felt the duty which he has thereby imposed upon us, of cultivating this divine attribute with the most diligent and unremitting care and attention, that we may he enabled to show forth his glory and render ourselves useful to the happiness ol mankind, the degree concluding with the remem - brance that we all, without exception, are trav - eling on the level of time to that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns. To the man whose mind has thus been moulded to virtue and science, Nature presents one more great and useful lesson—the knowl - edge of himself. She prepares him by con - templation for the closing hours of his ex - istence, and when, by means of that contem - plation, she has conducted him through the intricate windings of this mortal life, she finally instructs him how to die.

M. H. A. Your representation of our G. M. H. A. is a type of the upright man in his progress through life. Although there was a time when others might implore Divine protection for him, now, in the presence of Death, through his own lips, must he seek salvation. There can be none to assist him.

To the careless and thoughtless the lesson would end here; but the upright and true Mason will pursue it further, and apply it to the eternal salvation of his soul, so beautifully typified by the ever-green Sprig of Acacia, which teaches us, that, although our frail bodies must, sooner or later, moulder in the bosom of our mother Earth, yet through the merits of the Divine promises contained in the Word of God, we may confidently hope that our souls will bloom in immortal green.

We thus close the lecture of the second section with a tribute to the memory of that distinguished artist who preferred to lose his life rather than betray his trust. —0 r Master M~ason KING SOLOMON’S TEMPLE was situated on Mount Moriah, near the place where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and after - wards became the threshing floor of Oman, the Jebusite, which David purchased for the pur - pose of erecting an altar there, and where he met and appeased the destroying angel. This magnificent structure was commenced in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon, on the second day of the month Zif, being the second month of the sacred year. Seven years were employed in its construc - tion, during which time, Josephus informs us, it rained not in the day time, that the workmen might not be obstructed in their labor. From sacred history we also learn that there was not heard the sound of axe, hammer, or any metal tool in the house while it was building. 140 Master Mason The weeping virgin denotes the unfinished state of the Temple; the broken column, that one of the principal supports of Masonry had fallen in the death of our G. M. H. A.; the open hook, that his virtues were upon perpetual record; the sprig of acacia, the timely discovery of his body; the urn, that his ashes were safely deposited to perpetuate the memory of so dis - tinguished a character; while Time, behind her, unfolding the flowing ringlets of her hair, denotes that Time, patience, and perseverance will accomplish nearly all things.

IMy brother, you are now, technically speaking, a Mason, but whether or not you are going to be a Mason in reality rests entirely with yourself. The members of this lodge deemed you honest in your expressed desire to be a Mason, and I urge you to show the fraternity that they were not mistaken in their judgment of you, and that they have not erred in admitting you into our ancient and honorable order. It would be well, my brother, at this time to ask yourself the question, “What is it to be a Mason?” Do you think that membership in a Masonic lodge makes you a Mason? If you have the proper con - ception of Masonry you will admit that it does not, only in name, for membership in a Masonic lodge can no more make you a Mason than membership in a musical club can make you a musician. However, it is quite apparent that if you are so inclined and have natural muskal talent, in such membership you will find helpful stimulus and pleasant felloxvship with congenial and kindred Bpirit8, and so it is in Masonry and the Masonic lodge. It is the involuntary thoughts of your heart and the voluntary acts of your life which determine your character as a man and Mason. There are four classes of men in this world: First, those who are Masons neither n name or nature; second, those who are Ma8ons in name only; third, those who are Masons only by nature, and laatly, those who are Masons 1)0th in name and nature, and this class are God’s noblemen; but if I could not be numbered with them, I had rather be a Mason by nature— that is, at heart—than a Mason only in name. In taking the degrees the practice of many commendable virtue, warn enjoined upon you, only a few of which, pethaps, you can recall at this moment, and too many for me to reiterate just now. But let me sum them all up by reminding you of ju8t one symbol in the first degree—that of a point within a circle. The Worshipful Master told you the point represented an individual brother—that is you; the circle, the boundary line of your duty toward God and man, beyond which you should never 8uffer your passions, interests or prejudices to betray you on any occasion. The circumference of thi8 circle—the boundary line of your duty—is clearly defined in the sacred Scriptures and elucidated by the patron saints of Masonry, and while you keep yourself thus circumscribed, my brother, it is impossible that you should materially err. I congratulate you, my brother, and may the C. A. 0. T.

The Lodge of Sorrow, on the contrary, is intended to celebrate the memory of our departed brethren; and while we thus recall to our recol - lection their virtues and temper anew our resolutions so to live that, when we shall have passed the silent portals, our memories may be cherished with grateful remem - brance, we learn to look upon death from a more elevated point of view, to see in it the wise and necessary transition from the trials and imperfections of this world, to the perfect life for which our transient journey here has been the school and preparation. Vocal and instrumental music are indispensable to the proper efiect of the cere - mony. The brethren should wear dark clothing and white gloves and aprons. There is no necessity for any attempt at secrecy in the ceremony of Sorrow Lodges. They may be held in churches or public halls, or in the presence of friends at the lodge-room with benefit to all concerned. PREPARATION OF THE HALL. 1. The lodge-room or hall should be appropriately draped in black, and the several stations covered with the same emblem of mourning. 2. On the Master’s pedestal is a sirull and lighted taper. 3. In the center of the hall is placed the catafalque, which consists of a rectangular platiorm, about six feet long by four wide, on which are two smaller platforms, so that three steps are represented. On the third one should be an elevation of convenient height, on which ii placed an urn. The platform should be draped in black, and a canopy of black drapery may be raised over the urn. 4. At each corner of the platform will be placed a candlestick, bearing a lighted taper, and near it, facing the east, will be seated a brother, provided with an extinguisher, to be used at the proper time. 5. During the first part of the ceremonies the lights in the hall should burn dimly. 6. Arrangements should be made to enable the lights to be increased to brilliancy at the appropriate point in the ceremony. 7. On the catafalque will be laid a pair of white gloves, a lambskin apron, and if the deceased brother had been an officer, the appropriate insignia of his office. 8. When the lodge is held in memo, y of several brethren shields bearing their names are placed around the cata - falque.] OPENING CEREMONIES.

MASTER—Brother Senior Warden, our recol - lections of our departed brothers have been refreshed and we may now ask ourselves were they just and perfect Masons, worthy men, unwearied toilers in the vineyard, and possessed of so many virtues as to overcome their faults and shortcomings? Answer these questions as Masons should answer. S. W.—Worshipful Master, man judgeth not of man. He, whose infinite and tender mercy passeth all comprehension, whose goodness endureth forever, has called our brethren hence. Let Him judge. In ancient Egypt, no one could gain admit - tance to the sacred asylum of the tomb until he had passed under the most solemn judgment before a grave tribunal. Princes and peasants came there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted the history of their lives and threw the penetrating light of truth on their actions. If it were adjudged that the dead man had led an evil life, his memory was condemned in the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulchre. Masonry has no such tribunal to sit in judg - ment upon her dead; with her the good which her sons have done lives after them, and the evil is interred with their bones. She does require, however, that whatever is said concerning them shall be the truth; and should it ever happen of F Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow 203 a Mason who dies that nothing good can truth - fully be said, she will mournfully and pityingly bury him out of her sight in tears, and silence.

Although th,9 ceremony was part of the Mysteries, yet it was well known to all. as it was founded upon the peculiar funeral lites of the Egyptians. From this ~udgment in this world no Egyptian was exempt, no matter how exalted his position, and upon this tiial depended the right to an honorable burial. All whom the deceased person had wronged, and all who knew of his evil deeds, were permitted to testify over his dead body, while his Iriends and kindred loudly proclaimed lii’, virtues The decisLon followed the weight of the evidence; and even a king who had led a bad and wicked life might be excluded from burial in his own sepulchre. And the ‘assessors’ at the funerai were allowed to pronounce a condemnation, which I-. all agreed would also be received in a future state. This trial of the dead in this world was typical of the Judgment of Amenti. 0 where OsLr¶s presided itt the invisible world, and which the devout I— Egyptian believed took place there at the same time.

If secular associations have found it expedient by the adoption of some preparatory forms, to avoid the appearance of an unseeming abruptness in proceeding to business, it may well be supposed that religious societies have been still more observant of the custom, and that as their pursuits are more elevated, the ceremonies of their preparation for the object of their meeting should be still more impressive. In like manner a Lodge of Masons should be opened with ceremonies of the most solemn character, in which, that attention may be given to their symbolic as well as their practical import, every member present is expected to take a part. They are of general concern and in them all should assist. When the hour for opening has arrived, the Master will take his station and congregate his Lodge. The brethren properly clothed will take their seats and the officers repair to their respective stations and places. The accepted forms in use in declaring the Lodge duly opened are as follows~ When the Lodge is opened with the Grand Master in the Chair, he should declare the same “opened in ample form;” when the Deputy Grand Master, Grand Senior Warden or Grand Junior Warden performs this ceremony it should be declared “opened in due form;” when by the installed Master, it is “opened in form;” when by a Warden or other proper person, it is “opened with the usual ceremonies.” A Lodge is said to be opened “on” and not “in” a cer - tain degree (which latter expression is often incorrectly used) in reference rather to the speculative than to the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"210 Opening and Closing Ceremonies legal character of the meeting: to indicate that the members are to be circumecribetl in the limits of a par - ticular case, but that they are met together to tunite in contemplation on the symbolic teachings and divine lessons, to inculcate which is the peculiar object of that degree.

The opening on every degree should be full and explicit and the Lotlge that ptirsties this custom ss-i!l find many visitors who come for “light in Masonry.” To close the Lodge “in shorl form” aftet conferment of a degree is to cheat the canditlate of his right to best possible “first impressions In displaying the Gteater Lights the Volume of the Sacred Law should be opened at Psalm 133 in the Entered Apprentice degree; at Amos 7 in the Fellow Craft degree, and at Ecclesiastes j 2 in the Master Mason degree.

Brethren will not, of course, pass between the Master and the Altar when the Lodge is opened, nor walk about the room without the Master’s permission.

Installations are part of the lodge work and the lodge should not be closed nor “called off” while being performed. The Master-elect must in all cases be the first officei installed, except in his absence. An officer-elect cannol be installed by proxy, certainly not unless pursuant to express provision of the Grand Lodge authorizing such procedure. No person can be installed as Master who has not theretofore been installed as a Warden of a regular lodge. The Installing Officer will select a competent brothei to act as Marshal. In some jurisdictions it is required that the Master- elect shall, previous to his installation, be put in possession of the secrets of the Chair. In this country this ceremony is usually called the “Past Master’s Degree,” while in England and her Dominions the “Past Master’s Degree” is not recognized but the ceremonies are there conducted by a “Board of Installed Masters,” so called. The lodge is opened on the Master Mason degree. The Marshal, accompanied by the Master-elect, approaches the west of the altar, salutes the Installing Officer, the Marshal saying:] MARSHAL—Worshipful Master, I present to you our worthy Brother A. B., Master-elect of this Lodge, whom I know to be of good morals and great skill, true and trusty, and a lover of the whole Fraternity, wherever dispersed over the face of the earth, to receive at your hands the benefit of Installation. MASTER—Worshipful Brother, your presenta - tion shall be attended to, for which purpose I shall first address a few observations to the brethren and then call your attention to the necessary qualifications in every candidate for the Master’s Chair. Brethren, from time immemorial it has been an established custom among Freemasons for each Lodge once in each year, at a stated period, to select from amongst those members of the Lodge who have previously been installed as Master or as a Warden of a Lodge in this State, where such a brother so qualified consents, an experienced Craftsman to preside over them in the capacity of Master. He must have been regularly elected by the Master, Wardens and brethren in open Lodge assembled. Previous to his installation, it was formerly necessary and still is in many jurisdictions, that the Master- elect present himself to qualified brethren and be solemnly inducted into the Oriental Chair of King Solomon, with us called the reception of the degree of Past Master. The secrets of the Chair are to be communicated only to Masters- elect by a Convocation of Past Masters. In some jurisdictions it is by a Board of Installed Masters. In this State the possession of the secrets of the Chair is not essential to installation, submission to this ceremony being entirely optional with the Master~elect.* ‘if the Past Masters degree us required in the particular juruaduction where this monitor may at the lime he used the phraseology should of course, he changed to state that fact."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Installation Ceremonies 252 253 InstalkU ion Ceremonies Addressing Master.elet I MASTER—Brother A.

He must have been regularly initiated, passed, and raised in the three established degrees of the Order, be well skilled in the noble science, and have duly served the office of Warden in a regular Lodge in this State.

The honor, reputation, and usefulness of your lodge will materially depend upon the skill and ability with which you manage its concerns, whilst the happiness of the brethren will be increased in proportion to the zeal and assiduity with which you promulgate the genuine principles and tenets of the Institution. As a pattern of excellence consider that grand luminary of nature, which, rising in the east, regularly diffuses light and lustre to all within its circle. In like manner, Worshipful Master, it is your peculiar duty to communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your lodsze. Installatson Ceremonzes 261 Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high importance of Freemasonry, seriously admonish them never to disgrace it, charge them to practice out of the lodge those precepts they have been taught within it, that by virtuous, amiable and discreet conduct they may prove the happy and beneficial effects of our ancient and truly honorable Institution, so that when a man is said to be a Mason the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour forth its sorrows, to whom the distressed may prefer their suit, whose hand is guided by justice and heart is expanded by benevolence. In fine, Worshipful Master, by a strict adherence to the by-laws of your lodge, the Constitutions of the Fraternity, but above all that Sacred Volume which is sent to light and govern your faith, you will be enabled to lay up a crown of joy and rejoicing which will remain when time with you shall be no more, and may T. G. A. 0. T. U. grant you health, strength and wisdom to conduct the affairs of your lodge with credit to yourself and the advantage of its members. [In iieu of the foregoing address to the new Master the Installing Officer may deliver the following:] IMASTER—I wou[d have you regard this office as the highest honor your brethren can bestow upon any member of their circ[e. High honor is necessari[y the portion of the Master; it must be so, because the responsibi[ities attaching to the office are great and exact many qua[lties of both brain and heart. Regard, then, your promotion from the Co[umns, which you have now forever [eft, neither as an empty honor merited by the force of seniority 260 II Installation Ceremonte3"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"r Installation Ceremonies nor as a reward deserved by faithful service; it may be this, but you will fail to grasp its full significance and to develop its function adequately if you do not realize that example and service are the outstanding attributes of the Master. Successful leadership requires a number of subtle qualities, and among these the most prominent are the possession of the respect and the esteem—or shall I say the love—of your brethren; and these, my brother, are but the attributes, the title-deeds of every good Mason. By qualities of mind, but more especially by attributes of heart, shall you succeed in winning the confidence, the loyal support and the affection of your brethren. Your part of it will be to enlighten their minds with true wisdom. If your attitude toward the great art we practice is a correct one, then you will receive the strength necessary for this undertaking so that you may be enabled to unfold to your brethren the beauty of the hidden doctrine which lies at the root of Freemasonry. The prosperity of the lodge is a charge about to be [aid upon you. Now, material prosperity in a lodge is a good thing; it may be an essential thing for the continued existence of your lodge as an active member of the order, but there is a more important aspect of the lodge’s function to which I wish to draw your attention. As all corporate life consists of the close inter-action of body, mind and spirit, so here we are concerned with the material, moral and spiritual welfare of the corporate body, the lodge. Acknowledging, as we do, the temporary nature of all things material and the permanent nature of the psychic or spiritual, we might apply this touchstone to the state of health of our lodge. While members thus throng our portals, are we making real Masonic progress in the build. ing of the invisible temple at which we labor—this house not made with hands which shall endure for all time, dedicated to the service of the Most High, constantly being refined so that it may indeed become the dwelling r lace of the Most High? This may fitly be a question or each individual member of the lodge to answer for himself, but it is addressed with added force to the Master as the responsible head of the lodge, whose primary Installaiwn Ceremonies 263 function is to direct the labors of the lodge as well in the higher and spiritual as in the material spheres. Freemasonry is no dead pile of stones and unmeaning timber, it is a living thing. When you enter it you hear a sound—a sound as of some mighty poem chanted. Liaten long enough and ~ ou will hear that it is made up of the beating of human earts, of the nameless music of men’s souls—that is, if you have ears to hear. If you have eyes, you will preaently see the edifice itself—a looming mystery of many shapes and shadows, leaping sheer from floor to dome. The work of no ordinary builder! The pillars of it go up like the brawny trunka of heroes; the sweet flesh of men and women is moulded about ils bulwarks—strong, impregnable: the faces of little children laugh out from everx cornerstone; the terrible spans and arches of a are the joined hands of comrades; and up in the heights and spaces are inscribed the numberless musings of all the dreamers of the world. It is yet build - ing—building and built upon. Sometimes the work goes on in deep darkness; sometimes in blinding light; now under the burden of unutterable anxiety, now to the tune of great laughter and heroic shoutings like the crack of thunder. Sometimes, in the silence of the night-time one may hear the tiny hammerings of the comrades at work up iii the dome—the comrades that have climbed ahead. If we are true and worthy craftsmen we would work without ceasing at the perfection of this sublime edifice— each of us in his own corner laboring incessantly at the development of his mental, moral and spiritual powers so that joined together and supplementing the attainmenis of our brothers and fellow workers, we may finally achieve a measure of the perfection which is our aim and which is the offering we would bring the Most High. Realize, then, the gieat spiritual facts our singularly beautiful ritual aeeks to inculcate. It is for you, as pre - siding Master, to give adequate expression to and inter - pretation of these, not only in your utterances but in your life and conduct. As a Freemason once put it: “He is a 262"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"264 Installation Ceremontes Installation Ceremonies 265 poor craftsman who glibly recites the teachings of the order and quickly forgets the lessons they convey; who wears the honorable dress to conceal a self-seeking spirit; or to whom its great and simple symbols bring only an outward thrill, and no inward urge toward the highest of all good. Apart from what they symbolize, all symbols are empty; they speak only to such as have ears to hear. At the same time we have always to remember what has so often and so sadly been forgotten, that the most sacred shrine on earth is the soul of man, and that the temple and its offices are not ends in themselves, but only beautiful means to the end that every human heart may be a temple of peace, of purity, of power, of pity, and of hope.” Regarded in this light you will see that the responsibility resting on the shoulders of the Master is no light one, since all look to him for example, guidance and inspiration. For great is the trust placed in his hands, and he can not—he dare not, as an honest man—shirk the responsibilities it involves. May the Great Architect of the Universe grant you grace so as to unite in your person the attributes of the ideal Master, that you may shine brightly in this your lodge, and afford the stimulus of example which is the vitalizing incentive to your brethren in all their labors.—So mote it bell (The Master then proceeds to install the remaining officers or calls upon the instaihog Officer to continue the ceremony, an he sees proper.] MASTER—Brother Marshal, present the Wardens-elect to the altar.

In addition to observing the law, it will also be the duty of the officers to conform to the rules and regulations of the Grand Lodge in regard to work. The desire on the part of lodges under dispensation to confer degrees upon applicants too often results in the admission into our Fraternity of some who are not worthy and well qualified. Bear in mind that the stability of a Lodge depends upon the quality of its members, and not upon the number upon whom its favors are bestowed. As the strength of a chain is tested by its weakest link, so the standing of a Masonic Lodge is measured by its weakest member.

Every letter of Dispensation expires by limitation at the close of the next succeeding annual communication of the Grand Lodge unless continued in force by the Grand Lodge. If the prayer of the petitioners is granted and a Charter is issued the Grand Master may proceed in person to consecrate and dedicate the new Lodge and to install its new officers under its Charter, or he may appoint as his proxy any qualified Master or Past Master affiliated with a regular lodge. If the ceremony is conducted by the Grand Master in person it is said to be “in ample form,” if by the Deputy Grand Master, Grand Senior Warden or Grand Junior Warden, it is said to be “in due form,” and if by any other person it is said to be “inform.” The Grand Master (or the brother appointed to repre - sent him) and the other Grand Officers (or other Master Masons appointed by the representative of the Grand Master to represent such Grand Officers in the ceremonies about to be conducted) meet with the members of the new Lodge on the day and hour appointed for consecrating the Lodge and open a Lodge of Master Masons. He will then hold an election among the brethren for the office. of Treasurer and Secretary (and for Master and Warden. if they shall not have been named in the Charter), and the Master-elect shall nominate the Deacons, Stewards and Tyler. w 278 BENEDICTION."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"By way of preliminary preparation the “Lodge Symbolic” should be placed midway between the altar and the East. This piece of furniture, technically called “the Lodge,” being symbolic of the whole Lodge, should be a properly draped table or platlorm, about three by six feet, thirty inches high—essentially a “double cube”—draped with white linen to the floor. Upon it should be placed the Great Lights, and the three vases or pitchers containing the elements of consecration. Around it, in their proper positions, should be arranged three burning tapers, representatives of the Lesser Lights. Near it should be placed a pedestal upon which should lie the open Book of Constitutions. Where these several pieces of furniture and paraphernalia are borne into the room by the procession hereafter described, they will then be placed upon “the Lodge” as directed. The Book of Constitutions should not be borne in the procession unless the Grand Master shall be present therein in person. See Regulations for Processions, page 324. Inasmuch as the lodge is opened prior to the entry of the procession, it cannot legally convene and continue without the Great Lights upon the Altar. Accordingly, a separate set of the Great Lights should repose continually upon the regular Altar, whale around it should likewise stand the regular representatives of the Lesser Lights. In case it is desired to conduct the consecration cere - monies in public the lodge is opened and closed in an ante - room or at some previous hour and the election and other business then conducted and never in the presence of profanes.

Within these walls will be taught the doctrine that “of one blood made He all the nations of the earth,” wherefore all men are brethren, children alike of one father and mem - bers of one family. It will here be taught that wheresoever destitution exists, there also it is Masonic duty to relieve.

The brother who vouches should know to a certainty that the one for whom he vouches Is really what he claims to be. He should know this, not from a casual conversation, nor a loose and careless inquiry, but from “SingS iris 1 , due examinsi ins. or lawful snfsrma*ion.” These are the three requisites which the iitua~ has laid down as essentially necessary to authoiize the act of voucbing Let us inquire into the import of each. 1, SSrscS Trsal. By this is meant Ihat every question Is to he asked, and every answer demanded, which is necessary ho convince the examiner that the party examined is acquainted with what he ought to know, to entitle him to thin appellation of a brother, Nothing is to be taken for granted—categorical answers must be returned to all thai is deemed importanl to be asked, no forgetfulness is to be excused; nor is the want of memory to be considered as a valid reason for the want of knowledge. The Mason who is so unmindful of his obligations as to have forgolten the instructions he has received, mush pay the penalty of his carelessness, and be deprived of his contemplated visli to that society whose secret modes of recognition he hiss so little valued as not to have treasured them in his memory, The “strict irial” refers to the matter which is sought to be obtained by inquiry, and while there are some things which may safely be passed over in the investi. gation of one who confesses himself to be “rusty.” because they are details which require much sludy to acquire and constant practice to retain, there aie still otiser things of great importance which must be rigidly demanded. 2. Due Examinahssst. If “strict trial” refers to She ,naiher, ‘due examinaruon alludes to the mode of invesrugation. This musS be conducted with all the necessary forms aiid antecedeni cautions Inquiries should be made as in tire rime and place of initiahins as a preliminary, the Tyler’s 0.

Reception of Visitors 323 Let everything goon in regular course; nor is it to be supposed that the information sought was originally received, Whatever be the sus - picions of imposture, let no expression of these suspicions be made until ihe final decree for rejection is uttered. And let that decree be utlered in general terms, such as. “I am not satisfied.” or “I do not recognize you,” and not in more specific language, such as, “You did not answer Ibis inquiry.” or. “You are ignorant of that point,” The candidate for examination is only entitled to know that he has not complied generally with the requisli ions of his examiners. To descend to partic - ulars is always impioper, and often dangerous. Above all, never ask what the lawyers call “heading queshions,” which include in themselves She answer, nor in any way aid the memory, or prompt the forgetfulness of the party examined, by the slightest hints. 3. Lawful Jsifor’maiion. This authority for vouching is dependent on what has been already described. For no Mason can lawfully give information of another’s qualifications unless he has himself actually tested him. But it is not eveiy Mason who is qualified to give “lawful information “ Ignorant or unskillful brethren cannot do so, because they are incapable of discovering truth or of detecting error A “rusty Mason” should never attempt to examine a stranger, and certainly, if he does, his opinion as to the result is worth nothing, If ihe information given is on the ground that the party vouched for has been seen sitting in a Lodge, care must be taken to inquire if it was a “just and legally constituted Lodge of Master Masons.” A person may forgeS from the lapse of time and vouch for a stranger ass Master Mason, when thin l.odge in which he saw him was only opened on the First or Second Degree. Information given by letter, or lhrosgh a ihird party, is irregniar. The person giving She information, the one receiving it, and the one of whom it is given should all be present 51 ihe time, for otherwise there would be no certainty of identity. The information must be positive, not founded on belief or opinion, but derived from a legitimate source. And lastly, it must not have been received casually, but for the very purpose oh being used for Masonic purposes. For one to say to another, “A. B. Is a Mason,” Is not sufficient. He may not be speaking with due caution, under the expectation that his words will be considered of weight. He mush say something to this effect, “I know this man to be a Master Mason. for such and such reasons, and you may safely recognize him as such.” This alone will insure the necessary care and proper observance of prudence. Lastly, never should an unjustifiable delicacy weaken the rigor oh these rules. For the wisest and most evident reasons. thai mercifu’ maxim of the law, which says that it is better that ninety-nine guiht~ men should escape than that one innocent man should be punished. is with us reversed: so that in Masonry iS is belier ihag usneiy and nine mae men should be Surned auuay from She dosr of a Lodge, Shan Shah on, gouean should be odmsiied —Mackey. ~‘Encydsfuaedsa of Freemasonry.” 322 Reception of Visitors"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Processions of the Craft 325 As Mackey observes in his u~Encyclopaedia of Free - ulasonry”: u~ln America, public processions of the craft were some years ago very common, nor have they yet been altogether abandoned; although now practiced with greater discretion and less frequently, being in general restricted to special occasions of importance, such as funerals, the laying of corner stones, or the dedication of public edifices. “The question has often been mooted, whether public processions, with the open exhibition of its regalia and furniture, are or are not of advantage to the Order. In 1747 it was thought not to be so, at least in London, but the custom was contintied, to a great extent, in the prov’ inces * * ~“ That the Grand Lodges ot to-day entertain the same doubt is apparent from the very general local regulations which prohibit a lodge from appearing in public except on St. John’s Day, or to attend divine services or funerals Upon other occasions they must secure the permission ot the Grand Master. Appearances in public upon mere uusl~Ow occasions” or where not required or permitted by Masonic law are to be avoided Mackey gives the tollowing regulations for processions: When the Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, or either of the Grand Wardens, joins the procession of a l)ri”’ate lodge, proper respect is to be paid to the rank of ihat officer His position will be immediately before the Master and Wardens of the lodge, and two Deacons with scarlet rods will be appointed to attend him. When the Grand or Deputy Grand 1\\Iaster is present, the Book of Constittitions will be borne before him The honor of carrying this book belongs ot right to the Master of the oldest lodge in the jurisdiction, whenever he is present, in allusion to the fact that the Constitutions ot the Order were originally vested in that officer, and that on him the business of the Grand Lodge devolves, in case of the absence of all the Grand Officers, and also because it was a custom adopted soon after the reorganization of the Grand Lodge of England, for the Master of the olilest lodge to attend every Grand Installation, and taldng precedence of all others, the Grand Master only excepted, ho deliver the Book of Constitutions to the newly installed Grand Master, thereby to remind him of his obligation to preserve the ancient landmarks and Constitutions in - violate. The Book of Constitutions must never be borne iii a procession unless the Grand Master or Deputy Grand Master be present. In entering public buildings, the Bible, Square and Compasses, and the Book of Constitutions, are to be placed in front of the Grand Master, and the Grand Marshal and Grand Deacons must keep near him. When a procession faces inward, the Deacons and Stewards will cross their rods, so as to form an arch for the brethren to pass beneath. Marshals are to walk or ride on the left flank of a luro - cession. The appropriate insignia for a Marshal is a scarf and baton. The color of the scarf must be blue in the procession of a subordinate lodge, and purple or scarlet in that of the Grand Lodge. The Grand Lodge of Kentucky early selected scarlet as its color. All processions will return n the same order n which they set out. The post of honor in a Masonic processious is always in the rear. Every officer must wear the jewel of his office. In all Masonic processions, iso Freemason shall wear the iuusignia of any Order not recognized by the Grand Lodge. The proper dress of Freemasons in procession is black clothes, white gloves and aprons. REGULATIONS FOR PROCESSIONS"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"326 Processions of the Craft FESTIVALS OF THE ORDER (Mackey.) In every country where Freemasonry is encouraged, its festival days are celebrated with great ceremony. These are, the festival of St. John the Baptist on the 24th of June, and that of St. John the Evangelist on the 27th of December. They are days set apart by the Fraternity to worship the Great Architect of the Universe; to implore his blessings upon the great family of manldud, and to partake of the feast of brotherly affection. Hence the Grand Lodge has recommended to every lodge, annually to celebrate one or both these days in such a way as will be most conducive to the advantage of the lodge, and the honor and benefit of the Institution. Whichever day may have been selected, the lodge about to celebrate it should assemble at its usual place of meeting, and, having been opened on the first degree, is called from labor and a procession is to be formed as follows: [See “Regulations for Processions.”] After return to the hall from divine service the Master may deliver a charge from the Chair upon such subjects connected with the Order, and the honor and happiness of the Cmft, as he may think proper. When a particular form is not elsewhere laid down in this book the following order of procession may be used by the subordinate lodge on public occasions: Tyler, with his sword; Two Stewards, with white staves; Entered Apprentices, two and two: Fellow Crafts, two and two; Master Masons, two and two; Masons of the higher degrees: Secretaiy and Treasurer; Oldest member of the lodge carrying the Ci eat Lights; Past Wardens; Past Masters; Junior and Senior Wardens; Junior Deacon*; Master; Senior Deacon. Deacons carry blue rods. eacb surmounted by a golden pine-cone."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"329 The Grand Honors of Masonry THE GRAND HONORS OF MASONRY Dr. Mackey in his article on “Honors, Grand” in his “Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry” says, in part: “The Grand Honors of Masonry are those peculiar acts and gestures by which the Craft have always been accustomed to express their homage, their joy, or their grief on memorable occasions. In the symbolic degrees of the American rite, they are of two kinds, public and private, which are used on different occasions and for different purposes. “The private Grand Honors of Masonry are performed in a manner known only to Master Masons, since they can only be used in a Master’s Lodge. They are practiced by the Craft only on four occasions: When a Masonic Hall is to be consecrated, a new lodge to be constituted, a Master-elect to be installed, or a Grand Master, or his Deputy, to be received on an official visitation to a lodge. They are used at all these ceremonies as tokens of con - gratulation and homage. And as they can only be given by Master Masons, it is evident that every consecration of a hall, or a constitution of a new lodge, every installation of a Worshipful Master, and every reception of a Grand Master must be done in the third degree. It is also evident, from what has been said, that the mode and manner of giving the private Grand Honors can only be personally communicated to Master Masons. They are among the aporrheta—the things forbidden to be divulged. “The public Grand Honors, as their name imports, do not partake of this secret character. They are given on all public occasions, in the presence of the profane as well as the initiated. They are used at the laying of corner stones of public buildings, or in other services in which the ministrations of the Fraternity are required, and especially in funerals. They are given in the following manner: * “ He then describes the ceremony which we now generally refer to as the Funeral Grand Honors. In his well-known monitor, “Manual of the Lodge,” Dr. Mackey carefully maintains the foregoing distinctions between the manner and occasions for giving the public and the private Grand Honors as well as “the usual marks of distinction in the different degrees of Masonry.” When one of the ceremonies was to be performed in the presence of others than Master Masons he expressly instructed that the public Grand Honors be given. Where Master Masons only were present he called for the private Grand Honors. The latter were the three-times-three hand claps which we now know as the public Grand Honors. That this same distinction prevailed in Kentucky for a number of years and is still prescribed by a well-known monitor is apparent from examination of Brother H. B. Grant’s “Vestpocket Trestle-Board.” In the ceremony for Installation of Officers at page 66, in the place for the Grand Honors, he directs: “The private Grand Honors. If in public give the public Grand Honors.” By an astel isk note he refers the reader to a footnote on page 87, where he gives the ceremonies which we now know only as the Funeral Honors. In his footnote on such page 66 Brother Grant gives the change in the accompanying exclamation which should be substituted when the public Grand Honors, as then used, were given on the occasions of public installations. But the ceremonies of Masonry change with time, as do the rites of other organizations. The ceremonies which Dr. Mackey and Brother Grant described as the public Grand Honors, for use at public installations and on other public occasions, have become to be used exclusively upon funeral occasions and are, in facts now known gen - erally as “Funeral Honors.” PRIVATE GRAND HONORS.

They are, of course, never accorded in the presence of the profane. There is no uniformity in the rules prescribing the occasions for the use of the private Grand Honors. Same Grand Lodges restrict them, except upon occasions of installation of the Master- elect, to greetIngs to the Grand Master only upon his visita - tion to the lodge. PUBLIC GRAND HONORS. The public Grand Honors are given by striking the palm of the left hand sharply with the right three times; then striking the palm of the right hand with that of the left three times, and finally striking the palm of the left hand with that of the right three times. The brethren should time the blows with the lead of the Master. Past Grand Masters, the Deputy Grand Master, and other elective Grand Officers, and Masters-elect of lodges at installation, are entitled to the public Grand Honors. They, also, are those to be used at the ceremonies of constitution of a lodge, consecration of a hall, if in public, and at corner-stone layings. FUNERAL HONORS. As heretofore pointed out, what we now practice only as funeral honors were once used on all public occasions such as public installations, corner-stone la~ings, etc. The accompanying exclamations varied according to the occasion. There has not been entire uniformity in the manner 4 giving the funeral honors, but the ceremony and accompanying exclamations as described in the Funeral Services have been more generally employed and have the advantages of greater ease and grace. See the illustration and footnote on page 177. SOME THINGS A MASTER OUGHT TO KNOW* In the whole list of offices recognized by the Masonic Institution as an organized FraterniLy, there is not one so important as that of the Master of a lodge. The Grand Lodge itself was the creature originally of four ancient London lodges and it is today dependent upon the continued practice of the Masonic tenets in the constit - uent lodges and among the profane. The well-being of the entire Craft ~iepends upon the character and conduct of the Masters of the subordinate lodges. in the earliest known ceremony of installation, that used by the Duke of Wharton, as described in the first edition of Anderson’s Constitutions (1723), the Grand Master’s Deputy “shall take the Master-elect from among his fellows, present him to the Grand Master, saying, ‘Right Worshipful Grand Master, * * * I present this my worthy brother to be their Master, whom I know to be of good morals and great skill, true and trusty, and a lover of the whole Fraternity, wheresoever dispersed over the face of the earth.’” He is admonished in the installa - tion charges now in use that he should be “one to whom the burdened heart may pour forth its sorrows, to whom the distressed may prefer their suit, whose hand is guided by justice and heart is expanded by benevolence” To such men Masonry intrusts her welfare. To such men Masonry has accorded certain “preroga - tives” or rights inherent in the office to which she has called them—rights which therefore impose certain corresponding duties upon the incumbent. Refeiences to ‘Cpnstttution” and ~Reguiations” in the following comments are to the Book of Constitutions (i940 Edition) of the Grand Lodge of ~entucky."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"II 332 Some Things a Master Ought to Know DUTIES AND PREROGATIVES, 1. To con gregate his lodge upon any emergency. The Master is the judge of the emergency and, without his consent, the lodge cannot be congregated or business transacted legally, except that the Grand Lodge has required that he shall call a meeting if so requested in writing by at least eight members of the lodge. (Const. Sec. 100.) Due notice of the call must be given the members and only the business specified in the call can be transacted. Such notice can be given by newspaper publication or by mail. 2. To attend regularly the communications of his lodge. This duty is so plain as hardly to need a comment. Few things weaken and demoralize the lodge so much as the Master’s frequent absence and there are few things that more thoroughly justify the lodge in appealing to the Grand Master to have him suspended from office and his place filled by the Senior Warden. (Reg. 277.) The Master should be in the lodge room in ample time before the opening hour to see that the hall and all matters are in readiness and that the several officers are ready to fill their stations and to discharge their duties. If visitors have appeared the Master should immediately appoint committees to examine them so that they may be enabled to witness the opening ceremonies ii possible. 3. To preside at all communications of his lodge. This duty is not only self-evident but is required (Const. Sec. 84). He cannot be deprived of this right except by the Grand Master (Const. Sec. 26; Reg. 204), to whom he is bound by his installation vows “to pay hom - age.” Nevertheless, he may call any officer or Master Mason to the Chair to preside during business or to confer degrees (Regs. 348, 349), and may at any time himself resume the East. Whoever is legally occupying the East is Master for the time being, is clothed with the power of the office, and is held to the same accountability. (Reg. 272.) 4. To open his lodge at the time specriied in the by-laws, Ihe nolice of a called meeting, and to close it at a suita - Some Things a Master Ought to Know 333 ble hour. The Master, as one of the Lesser Lights of the lodge, should, with the same regularity and precision of the movements of the other two Lesser Lights, open, rule, and close his lodge at the appointed time. There is nothing more discouraging than the tardiness of the Master in opening his lodge. Carelessness and indifference upon his part beget the same in the members. If the Master is present none can take from him his prerogative of opening the lodge, which it is likewise his duty to do at the time fixed. If the Master should not have appeared at the time designated, a Warden or Past Master, as prescribed in Sec. 104 of the Constitution of the Grand Lodge, may lawfully assume the East and open the lodge. A motion to adjourn, or to close, cannot be entertained in a Masonic lodge. The Master is the sole judge of the time to close the labors and he should see that it is done at a proper hour. Alter the lodge has been closed at a stated communication it cannot be opened a gain on the same day to transact any business which can only be transacted at a stated meeting. (Reg. 289.) 5, To fill vacancies. Unless a by-law requires the election of officers below the rank of Secretary, they are to be appointed by the Master. (Const. Sec. 80.) In case of the absence of any officer the Master appoints some brother to discharge the duties for the time being. No other officer of a lower grade has any right to occupy the higher station, although the Master may move up the lower officers pro tempore for instruction purposes. 6. To preserve order rn the lodge. His very title, Master, suggests his authority to keep order. The Book of Constitutions, Sec. 84, gives him “general super - vision over his lodge.” At his installation he was invested with the Gavel as a “potent emblem of power and of your authority * * * ~o preserve order and control your lodge * * * should always be promptly obeyed” 7. To see that the by-laws and resolutions of his lodge are observed, and that the Constitution, rules, regulations, and edicts of the Grand Lodge are duly obeyed. (Const. Sec. 84.) This is in harmony with his installation vows."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"334 Some Things a Master Ought to Know 8. To see that the annual returns are promptly made to the Grand Lodge. (Const. Sec. 84.) Also, make immediate report of officers elected. (Reg, 278.) 9. To attain proficiency in the work. (Const. Sec. 84.) It is also his duty to instruct his brethren therein. 10. To regulate the admission of visitors. While “the right to visit is inherent in every Mason,” including Entered Apprentices and Fellow Crafts as well as Master Masons, “any member of the lodge proposed to be visited may object to the presence of the visiting brother * * * and he shall not be admitted.” (Regs. 422, 423.) In the absence of objection from any other member, the Master should still exclude any visitor whose presence might disturb the peace of the lodge and hinder its work. Coincident with this power, since none may “pass or repass but such as are duly qualified and have permission of the Master so to do,” the Master may exclude a member of the lodge itself (see Mackey’s “Masonic Jurisprudence,” page 349), but he is subject to charges to the Grand Master by the aggrieved member if such prerogative shall have been exercised arbitrarily. 11. To control and terminate discussions and decide all questions of order and order of business. He shall “decide all questions of law and order,” subject to appeal only to the Grand Master. (Const. Secs. 84, 176,) This prerogative seems unquestionably to be one of the few landmamks of the Order which can be clearly determined. But this power cannot be arbitrarily exercised (vows of a Past Master), since he has at his installation received the by-laws of his lodge under a charge to see them “carefully and punctually executed,” and in his vows of office he has solemnly bound himself ‘strictly to conform to every edict of the Grand Lodge” not subversive of Masonry and to “submit to the awards and resolutions of your brethren in lodge convened.” For violations of these duties and the rights of the members he may be called to account by any member, who may present charges to the Grand Master, who may suspend the offending Master from his office. (Const. Secs. 50, 167; Reg. 179.) From this prerogative it follows that the motions to end debate, Some Things a Master Ought to Know 335 for the previous queption, and to resolve the lodge into a committee of the whole are not proper in a Masonic lodge. (See the section of this Monitor on Parliamentary Law.) On the other hand, a motion to secure a certain reasonable restriction upon debate need not be a violation of this prerogative. Tact in the exercise of this prerogative and a brotherly consideration for the views and feelings of the members displayed by the Master, will secure the cordial support of the brethren, even in extreme cases. 12. To use his utmost endeavors to preserve peace and harmony in the lodge, and by h~s deportment, both in the lodge and out of it, to be a good example to his brethren. With the high honor attached to the office of a Master of a Masonic lodge there consequently results a duty upon the incumbent so to demean himself as to maintain the honor of the Institution. He must himself practice the precepts which, in his installation charge, he is directed to communicate to his brethren. “Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high importance of Freemasonry, seriously admonish them never to disgrace it, charge them to practice out of the lodge those precepts they have been taught within it, that by virtuous, amiable, and discreet conduct they may prove the happy and beneficent effects of our ancient and truly honorable Institution, so that where a man is said to be a Mason the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour forth its sorrows, to whom the distressed may prefer their suit, whose hand is guided by justice and heart is expanded by benevolence.” 13. To be custodian of and preserve the charter of the lodge, and transmit it to his successor. The Grand Lodge looks to the Master for the preservation of the charter, and it is his duty always to have it in the lodge room or ante room at all meetings of the lodge. (Reg. 77.) 14. To appoint all committees. “The Master has the prerogative of appointing all special committees, and is entitled to be present at their meetings, and when present to act as chairman. This usage seems to be derived from the principle that whenever Masons congregate together"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"on Masonic business, the Master is entitled to govern them and to direct their labors.” (Mackey’s “Masonic Jurisprudence,” page 351.) 15. To cause an investigation of all un-Masonic conduct bT members of his lodge; also non-affiliates and members other lodges residing within his jurisdiction. The good name of the Institution must be preserved and the Master must exercise a careful supervision over the actions of the brethren, that the laws of Freemasonry are not violated and that all the brethren “come under the tongue of good report.” A Mason who is not a member of any lodge may be tried by the lodge within whose jurisdiction the offense was committed (Const. Sec. 162), and this jurisdiction persists after charges filed even though the offender should remove from the jurisdiction. (Reg. 228.) Members of lodges subordinate to other Grand Lodges are in certain cases amenable to trial by the local lodge. 16. To visit the sick and distressed. If it is the duty of every Mason to visit the sick and distressed affiliated with him in Masonic bonds, how much greater the duty of an installed officer! How much greater the duty of an installed Master! 17. To preside at Ihe funeral rites of deceased Masons. The Master with any proper sense of his responsibility will not permit a month to pass after his installation without qualifying himself for that solemn duty, the burial of the Masonic dead. After he has so qualified himself he can, if he so wishes, in good conscience call upon some competent Past Master to officiate on such an occasion. 18. To sign all warrants upon the Treasurer for payment of disbursements ordered by the lodge. Occasionally the by-laws authorize the Master to draw small sums from the Treasurer for emergency relief work. The Treasurer is limited in his power to make payments as provided in the by-laws and in the Book of Constitutions. (See Reg. 410.) 19. To represent the lodge sn Grand Lodge. As the Grand Lodge is the supreme tribunal upon all Masonic Some Things a Master Ought to Know 337 matters it is evident that every lodge should be represented in its deliberations. It is important that the qualified representative of each lodge should be present to prevent innovations, protect the interests of his lodge, participate in dispensation of Masonic justice, and establish those wider friendships so essential to a happy solution of human undertakings. 20. To install his successor. The Master has the right and prerogative of installing his successor and no one except the Grand Master can displace him. (Reg. 204.) An officer-elect cannot be installed by proxy nor can a member be installed against his will. (Reg. 211.) 21. To be exempt from trial by his lodge, The Master is not subject to charges except to the Grand Master, when the hearing is before the standing Committee on Appeals of the Grand Lodge. (See Const. Sec. 50.) He cannot be suspended by his lodge for non.payment of dues. 22. Miscellaneous rights and duties. It has sometimes been ignorantly asserted that no man can refuse Masonic office to which he has been elected! He cannot qualify for the office without assuming the installation vows. Every obligation in Masonry must be assumed of the free will and accord of the person so to be bound. “It is obviously improper to install a man by proxy or against his will.” (Reg. 211.) The Master “has the right to resign his office with consent of his lodge” (Reg. 316), and he has an “inherent right belonging to every Mason,” to demit at will. (Reg 112.) He is entitled to the honorable title of “Worshipful” from his brethren, because of the high office of which he is the incumbent, but it is a title of respect given to him by others and is not a part of his office. It is improper for the Master to sign his name “A. B., Worshipful Master.” It should be, “A. B., Master.” (Reg. 271.) 336 Some Things a Master Ought to Know"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"338 Some Things a Master Ought to Know Some Things a Master Ought to Know 339 The Master is eligible for re-election indefinitely, but for a Master to serve for many years is a reflection on the lodge and upon the Master himself. If he is capable he will so instruct his Wardens and members that there will be more than one who is “worthy and well-qualified” to take his place. (Reg. 273.) The Master-elect is no longer required to receive the Past Master’s degree to be qualified for installation as Master (Const. Sec. 82), but his elect ion makes him eligible to that degree. A question has sometimes arisen whether a member of a Royal Arch Chapter, who has been invested with the secrets of the Past Master’s degree as a prerequisite to exaltation to the august degree of Royal Arch Mason, is qualifizd to sit in a lodge of actual Past Masters convened to confer that degree upon the Master. elect of the lodge. This writer has always answered this question in the affirmative. There is no prohibition in the Book of Constitutions. Regulation 335 specifically takes cognizance of Chapter, or “virtual,” Past Masters and provides that they cannot, as such, install the new Master. While their admission to the convention of Past Masters assembled to communicate the “secrets of the Chair,” to the Master-elect may not be a matter of right, still they have themselves received those same secrets in a Masonic body fully qualified to confer them and in a manner recognized by the Grand Lodge. To exclude them from the convocation of Past Masters would seem to deny the validity of their investi - ture, which the Grand Lodge, by specifically recognizing the Chapter conference of the degree, has approved. The writer has felt that all persons who have legally received the “secrets of the Chair,” whether in a lodge of Past Masters under a blue lodge warrant or under a Chapter warrant, are entitled to commune together upon the same footing, except in an official capacity and except as specifically restricted either by the Grand Lodge or Grand Chapter. SOME PRAcrIcAL SUGGESTIONS. Following are some of the first things to be done by a Master after having been installed: Make arrangements with a physician, if possible a member of your own lodge, to attend the needy sick. Some brother may volunteer. Make arrangements with some hospital or similar institution where serious cases may be cared for at a minimum cost. Make arrangements with an undertaker to conduct funerals that your lodge may have, at a minimum cost. Visit all those who have been aided by your lodge either for a protracted period or at irregular times; ascertain their needs. Some of them may have received money unnecessarily, while others may not have been assisted sufficiently. Remember that the most worthy are the ones that are the least likely to make their wants known. If your lodge has a large membership or is located in a city, appoint a committee each month to visit those who are sick. A brother will appreciate a little attention from his lodge, even if he is not in need of monetary assistance, and the fact that a lodge shows sympathy for its sick members makes better Masons of them. If you have a sick brother in another town, notify the lodge or board of relief in whose jurisdiction he is. Appoint an entertainment or social committee, who shall provide entertainment for your members and their families in accordance with the financial ability of your lodge. A great many entertainments can be gotten up at practically no cost, and by developing the social side you will have a better lodge. Appoint a committee on delinquents, whose duty it should be to investigate all those who are in arrears with their dues and liable to suspension. A careful attention to the delinquent list will be found to be “good business.” Also appoint a committee for visitors, with the Senior Deacon as chairman, to welcome visiting brethren, see to their comfort and introduction to the lodge. [I II I"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"340 Some Things a Master Ought to Know Some Things a Master Ought to Know 341 Dr srREs 5. This is a very important question, especially so for a Master of a large lodge in a city where the membership is not so well known to him as a rule as to the Master in the country. In case of an application for rerief in his jurisdiction, he should try to ascertain first of all the history of the applicant, habits, etc.; and therefore the following questions are suggested: Age? Married? Single? Widower? How man y children? Their age and occupa - tion. Other relatives? Are any of them able or willing to assist you? What do you do to support yourself? Have you any property? Pension? Insurance—life or accident? Do you belong to any beneficiary organization? What sick benefit do you get? Have you been assisted by your lodge or a Masonic board of relief before? II so, when and where? Have you ever paid back any of the money given you? What are your needs at the present time? These fairly cover the ground, and give the investigator an insight into the needs of the applicant. Applicants may be classed under three heads: Second—Those with whom it has become a habit, and who find it easy; Third—Those who are in need and who are too proud or reluctant to make their wants known. The same course may be followed in the case of so - journers. The only difference is that care must be taken in examining credentials to see that the applicant is. in good standing in his lodge, after which temporary relief should be given him and a wiie sent to the lodge concerned, asking instructions. This wire may be worded briefly, and will as a rule bring the desired results. A telegram should be addressed to the Secretary of the lodge. If in a city and his address in unknown, send the wire to the Masonic Temple. Following are samples of telegrams: Secretary, Lodge, No......, Masons. Masonic Temple, ________City.

Prompt medical attention may save a long illness and correspond - ingly large expenditure. If the brother is in another city or town, communicate with the lodge in whose jurisdiction he is to look after him, if necessary by wire. If in a city, notify the board of relief. Remember, in every city where there are a number of lodges which have concurrent jurisdiction, a board of relief is established for the purpose of looking after so - journers. Never fail to see that your lodge promptly reimburses the other lodge or board of relief, within whose jurisdiction your member resides, for all disburse - ments they have made in ministering to his needs. Relief is established for the purpose of looking after sojourners. BURIALS. In case of death the family should be consulted at once, and arrangements made for a funeral. The first thing that should be ascertained is if they are destitute. This must be left to the discretion of the investigator, and if so the undertaker with whom arrangements have been made previously should be sent to take charge oi the remains. If the death occurs in the jurisdiction of another lodge, notify the Master or Secretary of that lodge (or if in a city, the board of relief), by wire, who, by following the same economical procedure outlined above will attend to this the same as you would yourself. The expenditures for the burial will vary a great deal according to the places and conditions, but should be the lowest possible obtainable under the circumstances, and by having an understanding with the undertaker, as mentioned in the first paragraph, all misunderstanding will be avoided. Make it plain to the family of the deceased brother that there are no benefits coming to them from the Masonic lodge, and that a burial is purely charity, and that they have no right to expect it unless they are absolutely destitute and there is no one else to pay the cost. Some families have su cient funds on hand to defray expenses of burial, but want to keep them for a rainy day, and want the lodge to pay, so as to conserve their own limited capital. To them must be explained that the lodge is not going out of business; that when they come to the end of their own means, if they make their needs known, the lodge will then do its duty. MASONIC HOMES. Rules governing admission to the Masonic Homes and applications may be obtained by addressing the Superin - tendent of the Masonic Widows and Orphans Home, 3701 Frankfort Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky, or to Superintendent of the Old Masons Home, Shelbyville, Kentucky. It has been the custom in recent years to include a great deal of information in reference to Our Homes in the annual proceedings of the Grand Lodge oi Kentucky. See further Regulations 264 to 269; 320 to 322, and 328 of the Grand Lodge in reference to Our Homes. Only those who are a charge on a lodge in Kentucky are eligible, as the Homes are maintained by OUR lodges, and all others must be taken care of by their own juris - dictions, many of which have Homes of their own. There is no doubt that if a woman with a child or two is left in destitute condition, the most practical thing to do is to put that child (or children) in the Widows and Orphans Home. That will leave the mother free to make her own living. Great delicacy must be exercised in approaching this subject with the average mother, as she naturally does not want to part with her children, but it should be fully explained to her that the children will get a better raising in the Home than she can possibly give them under such circumstances; and in the future, if her condition should change and she should again be able to take care of her children, she can always get them back without formality. BALLOTING. There is, sometimes, too much carelessness and indiffer. ence in balloting. The ballot for candidates should be a very solemn matter. It is no light thing to receive an"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"344 Some Things a Master Ought to Know unworthy person into a lodge as a member, or to reject one who is worthy. It is therefore suggested that all such balloting be done under the sign, as follows: The Master first examines the box and sees that the ballot chamber is empty and that a proper supply of white balls and black cubes is in the outer chamber. The box is then carried by the Senior Deacon to the Senior Warden and Junior Warden for examination. The Senior Deacon then returns the box to the Master who first announces the names of the candidates upon whose petitions the ballot is then to be spread and for what de~rees, and, if for the E. A. degree, whether the committee s report was favorable. He then casts his ballot and remains standing while the box is presented in succession to the Senior Warden and Junior Warden. Such officers rise, give the D. G. and S., deposit their ballots and remain standing at their stations. The Senior Deacon then deposits the ballot box on the altar so that the person who approaches it to cast his ballot shall face the East. The Master then calls up the craft, who form in line single file, approach the altar, give the D. G. and S., cast their ballots, return to their respec - tive places and remain standing until all have voted. The Senior Deacon should take position about six feet to the west of the altar, where the line should halt as each brother approaches the altar to vote. There is nothing in the Book of Constitutions which prohibits a ballot from being taken collectively upon two or more petitions, but if any member objects the ballot should be spread separately. Should one or more black cubes appear on a joint ballot the ballot must then be spread upon each petition separately. After all have voted the Master declares the ballot closed and orders the Senior Deacon to present the ballot to the Junior Warden and to the Senior Warden for examination. If, on inspection by the Wardens and the Master, two or more black cubes shall appear, the balloting upon that petition shall cease; but, if only one black cube shall appear on the first ballot, a second ballot shall immediately be spread before anyone leaves the room. If at least one black cube still appears the Master must declare the petition rejected. I Some Things a Master Ought to Know 345 EXAMINATIONS. Candidates for examination as to their proficiency in the lower degrees, prior to election to the next higher degree, should be seated in line from North to South, just west of the Altar. The examiner should take his position close to the East in order that all brethren present may hear clearly every question and answer. The sufficiency of the examination and the proficiency of the candidate may be determined by majority oral vote of the members present. If favorable, the ballot upon the advancement of the candidate to the next higher degree may then be spread. CIRCUMAMBULATION. The rite of circumambulation, derived from the Latin verb “circumambulare,” “to walk around anything,” is the name given to that observance in all the religious ceremonies of antiquity which consisted in a procession around an altar or some sacred object. It is historically connected with the reference to the apparent course of the sun about the earth. Since in the ellipse of the ecliptic there are no square corners, a Senior Deacon, who under - stands the symbolism and antiquity of this rite, will avoid cutting square corners at any change of direction, no matter how desirable or “pretty” such a maneuver may appear in a military parade."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Parliamentary Law 347 PARLIAMENTARY RULES APPLIED TO LODGE PROCEEDINGS TABLE OF MOTIONS IN THE ORDER OF THEIR PRECEDENCE.

PRIViLEGED MoTioNs are so called because, on account of their importance, they take precedence of all other questions whatever. 2. INCiDENTAL MoTioNs are such as grow out of other questions, and therefore take precedence of, and must be decided before, the questions which gave rise to them 3. SUBSiDIARY MoTioNs are such as are applied to other motions for the sake of disposing of them in some other way than by direct adoption or rejection. 4. MISCELLANEOUS MoTioNs, which are listed in the foregoing table, are such as cannot be included, on account of the rules which govern them, in any one of the classes above named. S. PRINcIPAL MOTION. By Main Question or Princi - pal Motion is meant a motion introduced on any subject when no other business is before the assembly. 6. ORDER OF PRECEDENCE. These motions, excepting the miscellaneous motions, are arranged in the order of their precedence, both as respects the classes, and as individual motions in respect to one another. By order of precedence is meant that when any given motion is pending, any motion standing above it in the list may be made, and be in order; hint any standing below it, except such as are indicated in the table, would not be in order. For instance, the motion to fix the time to which to adjourn, when no other question is before the assembly, and the motion to adjourn, when iii any way qualified, become principal (not privileged) motions, su hjec tto the laws of the principal motion; and Questions of Privilege can have any suhsidiary motion applied to them. But if a principal motion is made, and in reference to it the subsidiary motion is made ‘‘that it lie on the table,” it would not be in order to move the Previous Question, or to Postpone to a certain day, or to Commit, or Amend, or to Postpone indefinitely; because the motion to lay the subject on the table takes precedence of the other motions named, and must be decided before they can he made. And so of other motions in the order in which they stand The general rule is that when a motion is niade, any motion standing above it in the list would he in order, but any standing below it would not he in order. and by a glance at the table this can be determined instantly. 7. CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS. As in all permanent organizations there are sets of standing, written rules for the government of the assembly, so the Masonic lodge has a “Constitution’ composed of the constitution, by-laws, rules, regulations and edicts of the Grand Lodge, and it also has its own “By-laws” and fixed rules. The general rules of Masonic procedure, of course, take precedence over and repeal or modify any parliamentary rule not in harmony therewith to the extent of such conflict. 8 PRINCIPLES op MAsoNic JURISPRUDENCE In addi - tion to the constitution and edicts of the Grand Lodge and the standing rules and by-laws of the lodge, there are certain peculiar principles of Masonic jurisprudence which have heen evolved from the practice of the prim iples governing Masons in their intercourse. These principles in some cases vary from the general parliamentary rules governing deliberative bodies and, of course, prevail o~’er the latter in case of conflict. An endeavor will be made to point out these rules where they conflict with the general “common law” of parliamentary procedure. 0. Morroz~s, AND FORMS IN wriicri THEY ARE SUB. MITTED All business should be introduced by a motion made by some member of the lodge. No one can properly make or second a motion, without “obtaining the floor.” To “obtain the floor” is to rise and address the Master by his official title and be recognized by such officer. The Master recognizes the member hy calling his name. Then the member has the floor."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"354 Parliamentary Law Parliamentary Law 355 Having obtained the floor, do not say, “Worshipful Master, I motton” so and so: nor “I move you” so anni so Simply say, “Worshipful Master, I move” so and so A motion of importance is tnsually drafted in writing, com - nnencing with the words “Resolved, That,” so and so, the nnember then moving the adoption of the resolution PRIVILEGED MOTIONS. 10. To Fix THE TIME TO WHICH TO ADJOURN. This motion is not allowable in a Masonic todge inasnrnnch as the lodge does not “adjourn” and is closed only at the will and pleasure of the Master. 11. To ADJOURN. Thas motIon is not atlowable in a Masonic lodge. The Master alone has the right of closing his lodge, and a motion for adjournment worn Id necessarily interfere with his prerogative. This rule does not apply to a Grand Lodge which may, upon motion, terminate its session by majority vote, the Grand Master therennpon proceeding with the closing ceremonies. 12. QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE. These mnnst not be confounded with privileged qtnestions. It is difficult to enumerate all the qnnestions that may arise nnndler tIne headl “questions of privilege “ A few are noted but the Master must use his own judgment arid be gnnidled by precedent and such parliamentary instrnnction as he may be able to obtain in determining what comes properly nlnder this head. (a) Any matter that affects the character or reputation of a member. (Qnnestions relating to charges of mis - conduct are qnnestions of privilege, and may be presented at any time. A member who is making a personal ex - planation is to be allowed unnisual latitude, becannse of the importance of his reputation ) (in) Matters that affect the reptntation of the lodge, such as false and scandalotns reports of its proceedlings. (c) Matters affecting the secrecy or safety of the lodge, where a brother deems it necessary to give the proper precautions. The form is, “Worshipftnl Master, I rise to a qnnestion of privilege.” The Master reqnnests the memher to state his question; then he decides whether it is a question of privilege or not. If it is held to be a question of privilege it is disposed of according to the rules shown in the table. The procedure in relation to pleferring of charges is, of course, nisually regulated by the Grand Lodge. 13. ORDERS OF THE DAY. By this expression is meant those subjects the consideration of which has been assigned to some particular time. ‘When it is desirable to consider a subject at some future time, the motion is made that such a subject be made the “ornler of the day” for snich a time, fixing the precise time; or if regular business has been made the “general order” for such time, that the subject be made the “special order.” It requires a two-thirds vote to make a subject a special order, and then it takes precedence of the general orders. When the time arrives, the Master annonnnces the fact, or some member calls for the orders of the clay. The Master then says, “shall the orders of the day be taken up?” If no one objects, the cnnrrent business IS suspenclenl as if by an adjournment, and the orders of the day are at once taken up. If any one objects, the qtnestion “shall the orders be taken up?” must at once be ptnt to vote by the Master. If decided in the affirmative, the current bnnsi. ness is suspended as above; if in the negative, the orders of the day are postponed only until the question then before the lodge is disposed of. INCIDENTAL MOTIONS. 14. APPEAL (QUESTION OF ORDER) No appeal can be taken from any deciston of a Master of a todge to the tadge, but can only be taken to the Grand Master or Grand Lodge. In case of a reasonable doubt, the Master may of course avail himself of the advice and counsel of the most experienced members of his lodge, and especially of its Past Masters, before coming to a decision; hint, having arrived at that decision, and having officiallV announced it from the Chair, it is not reviewable by the lodge. A “point of order” is made in the lodge as in other assemblies and similarly decided by the presidine officer, the decision being reversible only by the Grand Master or Grand Lodge."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"356 Parliamentary Law Parliamentary Law 357 A member detecting any dlisordler inn tine proceedings of the assembly (to which ann appeal from the decision of its chairmanin ~vill lie) or nn tine deportmennt or dlecOrlnm of members, which me wishes to correct, obtainins the floor and says, ‘I rise to a point of Ordler ‘ The clnairunan resf)n)nnls, ‘‘Please state ~‘onnr i)onnnt of order.’’ The chair - man tinen decides whether or not the point is ~vell tal~en IS. ODJECTION TO CONSIDERATION OF A QUESTION. Some question may be intronlinced which the lodge may think is not a proper or profitable qnnestiou for consideration in open meeting. If so, some member rises and says, “I object to the consideration of this question.” The Master then immediately (no second being requiredl) srnbmits the qnnest ion in this form “Shall the qnnestion be dliscussed?” If two-thirds of the memhers present and voting vote in the negative, the whole matter is disnoissedl for that sessIon. The ohject of this motioni is to avoid altogetlner any qnnestion which may be dleemetl irrelevant or improrer. 16. READING OF PAPERS. When matters are brought before the lodge by written comniunnications, it is often desirable that such commnnnications Inave more than one reading. When anyone calls for the readling of a paper, the Master orders it read, if no onne objects If objection is made, the qnnestion must he put to vote without dlebate or amendment. If the paper has not been read any member has the right to call for the readling of any paper inclinnded in the communication, as no member can be in - qnniredl to vote on anny paper the contents of which are unknown to him. 17. WITHDRAWAL OF A MOTION. The person who makes a motion can withdlraw it if no obiection is made If ohjection is madle, he can withdraw it only on leave so to do by means of a motion to that effect This motion cannot be debated or amendled. When a motion is wnth - drawn, it is the same as if it had never been made 18. SUSPENSION OF THE RULES. When, as is often the case, the regular rnnles of a society wornld interfere with the accomplishment of certain bnnsiness which it is desirahle to bring at once to completion, provision is madle for a sus - ~, ension of the rules in Ordler to accomplish this object. he form of the motion is, “to suspend the rules which interfere with,” etc., specifying the object of the sus - pension. Manifestly, even the two-thirds vote required for the adoption of this motion, cannot suspend the operation of any provision of the Constitution, rules or edicts of the Grand Lonlge nor of the by-laws of the lodge. SUBSIDIARY MOTIONS. 19. To [~AY ON THE TABLE. The form of this motion is, “I nuove that the question lie on the table,” or “I move that the qnnestion be laid on the table,” or “I move to lay the qunestion on the table “ When this motion is carried, the subject is removed until formally taken up. To take up the matter again, the motion is, “to take tlne question from the table,” or “now consider the question” naming the one which was tabled. This motion is unde - batable and cannot have any subsidiary motion applied to the It. The object of motion to lay on the table is to postpone the subject in such a way that it can be taken up at any time, which would not be the case with either a definite or an indefinite postponement. It is also a con - venient way of suppressing a motion altogether, for as a practical matter the motion to take from the table is seldom resorted to. 20. THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. This motion is not atlounabte in a Masonic todge. As Mackey says, “Although there is no positive law on the subject, yet the spirit of comuty and courtesy which prevails in the Institution, the authority of the best Masonic jurists, and the general usage of the Fraternity, have concurred in the decision that the previous question cannot be moved in a Masonic lodge.” “I have never, in my own experience, known the motion for the ‘previous qunestion’ to be made in any Masonic body, and I suppose that the incompetency of such a motion has never been doubted.” The general rules governing this motion in assemblies where it is in order are shown in the table. 21. To LIHIT OR EXTEND DEBATE. Although the “previous question” to shnnt off all debate is not allowable there is no reason why the lodge should not protect itself from unnecessary discussion of the qinestion by adoptine"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"358 Parliamentary Law Parliamentary Law 359 a motion “that debate close and the question be put on the resolution at . . o’clock, P. M.,” or “that debate on the pending amendment be limited to twenty minutes,” or “that debate on the pending resolution and its amendments be limited to one speech of five minutes from each member,” etc. The motion applies only to the particular motion to which it refers. The Master has a large prerogative in the disposition of these motions. The motion may be reconsidered. One motion can be made after the other is adopted if they do not conflict. 22. To POSTPONE TO A CERTAIN DAY. A subject postponned to a certain day takes precedence, when the time arrives, of everything except primte~ed questions. Different questions postponed to different times, and not reached at the times specified, shall be taken up, when they are considered, in the order of the times to which they were postponed. A subject postponed to another meeting of the lodge should at that time come up as unfinished business. 23. To COHHIT OR REFER. The form of this motion is, “I move to refer the subject ~naming the subjecti to a committee.” It is usually a saving of time to include in the motion the number of which the committee shall con - sist, and how they shall be appointed, although, in a Masonic Lodge, it is frequently held that it is the prerog - ative of the Master to appoint the members of the com - mittee, the number of such members being designated by the lodge. Committees for action should consist of those only who are favorable to the proposed action; if for deliberation they should represent all sides of the question. 24. To AMEND. An amendment may be inconsistent with one already adopted, or may conflict with the spirit of the original motion; but it must have a bearing upon the subject. Its form may beto “add” or “insert,” to “strike out “ to “strike out certain words and insert others,” or to ‘~divide the question” into paragraphs. If it is moved to amend a motion, and then it is moved to amend the amendment, the vote is first taken on the amendment of the amendment, then on the amendment as amended (if it was thus amended), and then on the original motion as amended if the amendment of the motion was carried. In stating the question on amend - ments, the Master should iead, (1) the passage to be amended, (2) the words to be stricken out or inserted, etc., and (3) the passage as it will read when amended. And when the vote is taken, he should immediately state the question still pending, as “The question now recurs on the amendment as amended,” or on the motion as amended, as the case may be. The table shows what motions cannot be amended. 25. To POSTPONE INDEFINITELY. The relation of this motion to others, and the rules governing it, are suffi - ciently shown in the table. According to General Robert, “The object of this motion is not to postpone, but to reject, the main motion without incurring the risk of a direct vote on it, and it is made only by the enemies of the main motion when they are in doubt as to their being in the majority. * * * If adopted, its effect is to suppress the main motion for that session, unless the vote is recon - sidered. As the motion does not suppress the debate on the main question, its only useful effect is to give the opponents of the pending measure a chance of killing the main motion without risking its adoption in case of failure.” But, as observed by a Masonic writer, “we think the Masonic way to settle any question presented by a fellow meml,ner in the lodge is to take a sqnnare vote upon it.* ** Furthermore, as those ungracious methods of stifling debate called the previous question and adjournment are admittedly un-Masonic, the Master may well use his friendly influence, if not his power, to require a real vote of the lodge upon a question that has been lawfully introduced, properly debated, and fairly presented to his fellow members upon its merits. * * * No mere par - liamentary victory in the lodge will compensate a Mason for wounding the feelings of a brother.” PRINCIPAL MOTION OR MAIN QUESTION. 26. This is the motion, as already stated, by whl~n any subject is brought before the lodge for consideration. It should be in writing it so requested by the Master or"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"360 Parliamenta,y Law Parliamentary Law 361 any member. It takes precedence of nothing except another principal motion; as another motion if this kind cannot be made when any other question is before the lodge MISCELLANEOUS MOTIONS. 27. To RECONSIDER. When a motion has been passed it is sometimes found advisable, afterward, to modify, reverse, or otherwise change the action taken. To provide for such a contingency is the object of the motion to reconsider—a motion, which, if carried, brings the subject back before the lodge just as it stood before the vote was taken upon it. There are given in the table twenty rules applicable to this motion and, as can be seen, it is a motion subject to many peculiarities. It can be made when any other business is before the lodge, even if it interrupts a member in his speech; but action on such motion cannot be taken to interfere with current business. In this case, the motion is made, seconded, and entered upon the minutes; then the business before the lodge proceeds, and the motion to reconsider is held over to be called rip at any time before the close of the session when nothing else is pending. The motion to reconsider must be made on the same day on which the motion to be re - considered was voted upon, but it need not be acted upon on that day as stated above. This motion must be made by one who voted on the prevailing side, as otherwise it might be used greatly to embarrass and delay proceedings. But the prevailing side is not always the side on which there is a majority of the members. For instance, on a motion which requires a two.thifrds vote, a majority might vote for it, but if less than the requisite two-thirds, the motion is lost. The prevailing side is then the minority —the little more than one-third who voted against it. A motion to reconsider must in this case come from one who voted against the measure. When a motion to reconsider is passed, a person who had exhausted his privilege of debate when the question was first before the lodge cannot discuss it further. If he wishes to speak again on the subject his only recourse is to get in his speech while the motion to reconsider is pending. 28. FILLING BLANKS. Resolnitions are frequerrtly in - troduced, or reports of committees made, involving the appointment of a certain number of persons to serve on a committee or otherwise, a certain sum of money to be raised, or something to be done after a certain length of time, these points being left blank in the resolution or report, as it is desired that they shotrld be left wholly to the action of the members in open meeting. In these cases suggestions to fill these blanks can be made without the formality of a motion, by naming the number of persons, the sum of money, or the length of time; and in case a number of suggestions are made, the only way the mind of the lodge can be ascertained is to try tire vote on the highest number, the largest sum, or the longest time. For if a majority are in favor of the highest figirres in each case, they would be in favor of all that was called for in the lowest; and if the motion was made on the latter they could not vote against it and so the qriestion would be decided contrary to their will. 29. NoMINATIoNS. In many Masonic jurisdictions nominations are not permitted, the ballot being taken until some brother receives a majority of all votes cast. Nominations are not necessary when the election is by ballot or roll call, a brother who receives a majority of all votes cast being elected whether his name was in nomina - tion or not. Nominations having been made by a committee or from the floor the Master should inquire if there are any further nominations. Hearing none, he should, withoirt the formality of a motion, declare nominations closed, or any member can move “that nominations be now closed.” Upou being seconded, the qriestion is immediate - ly put to vote. This motion should not be entertained until a reasonable time has been allowed for further nominations. 30. RENEWING A MOTION. As a general rule, the introduction of any motion that alters the state of affairs makes it admissible to renew any privileged or incidental motion (except a motion for the orders of the day, or for suspension of the rules) or any subsidiary motion (except an amendment), as in such case the real question before the lodge is a different one."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"362 Parliamentary Law Parliametstary Law 363 A inotioni to ‘‘rescind,’’ “repeal’’ or ‘‘anininil’’ should be effective only by majority vote uponn the motioni after notice given to the membership, or by a majority of all the members of the lodge acting witholnt such notice. It is a mann motion without any l)rivilege. COMMITTEES. 31. COMMITTEES. A committee is ~n minniature assem - bly. ‘I’he first person named on a committee is the chairman; in his absence the next one named, and so on, unless the committee, by a majority vote, elect another member as chairman, as they have power to do. The Secretary of the lodge should furnish him, or some other member, a notice of the appointment names of the members, and the matter referred to them, with instruc - tions, if any have been given by the lodge. The chairman calls the committee together, and when a majority (which constitnntes a quorum) are present, reads, or causes to be read, the entire matter referred to them. He then reads each paragraph or separate section of the matter, pausing for amendments, and pnntting them to vote, if any. In this case the committee votes on its own amendments only, not on the matter committed to then,. This they report back to the lodge, recommending snnch changes as they have made by their amendments. TIne committee shonnlcl not write their changes nnpon the papers referred to them, bnnt should ~vrite their proposed changes on a separate sheet. If, however, the counmittee originate the resolu - tion, it havinng been nirafted by one of tlneir ununiber, they adopt the whole report in comnnittee before reporting and recommendir’g it to the lodge. Onuly what the committee agrees to in meeting assembled can be the report of the committee. The uninority can also present their report, collectively or individually, with the per - mission of the lodge, hnnt the assembly can act upon it only by snnbstituting it for the regular repon t. In com - mittee, a motion to reconsider can be proposed regardless of time elapsed pro~’icled every member who voted with the majority is present. A committee (except committee of tIne whole) may appoint a snnhcommittee. When through with their business, the motion is made “that the committee rise” (equivalent to a motion to adjourn in assemblies not governed by Masonic rules and, like that motion, is undebatable), and that the chairman or some other member specified, make a report of the action of the committee to the lodge. As soon as the lodge receives the report the committee ceases to exist. The lodge “receives” the report when it permits the chairman or any member to present it. To “accept” the report is the same as to “adopt” it, which makes the recom - mendations of the committee the action of the assembly. A motion, therefore, which is sometimes made, “to receive the report and discharge the committee,” is wholly im - proper, because, as stated, the report i’n “received” when it is presented, and when it is presented the committee is automatically discharged. 32. FORM OF COMMITTEE REPORTS. If a standing committee, the form is, “The committee on [giving the name of the committee] respectfully report as follows letting the report follow. If a select or “special cOm~ mittee,” the form is, “The committee to which was referred [stating the matter referred], having had the same under consideration, respectfully report as follows.” A minority report should be, “The undersigned, a minority of the committee to which was rel erred, etc.” All reports properly conclude with the words, “All of which is respect - fully submitted.” If the matter is of importance, the report should be signed by all concurring; if otherwise, the signatnnre of the chailman is considered sufficient. The report should generally close with formal resolutions embracing all that the committee recommend, so that adopting their report would adopt all that is necessary to carry their lecommendations into effect. Should anyone object to receiving the report, a formal motion to receive it becomes necessary. If received, the committee is dissolved, unless revived by a motion to recommit the subject to them. In this case all that has not been agreed to by the lodge is ignored, as if the report had not been made."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"364 Parliamentary Law Parliametskzry Law 365 The report is considered on a motion (usually nade by the member presenting the report) to “adopt,” “accept,” or “agree to,” as may be most appropriate to the case in hand. The report then stands before the lodge like a common motion, subject to debate, amendment, etc. The member who introduced it is first entitled to the floor to discuss it, and after all who wish to have spoken, he is also entitled to a final speech to close the debate If the report contains several propositions or para - graphs; as, for instance, a code of by-laws, the paper is first read entirely through by the secretary, then the Master reads, or causes to be read, each paragraph, pausing at the end for amendments. If none are offered to the first he says, “No amendment being offered to this paragraph, the next will be read.” In this way, he pro - ceeds through to the last paragraph, when he states that the whole report having been read, it is now open in any part to amendments, and if none is offered, he pints the question on the adoption of the whole paper, or as it has been amended if any amendments have been adopted. If there is a preamble it should be read alter the last paragraph. If the resolutions are rejected the preamble goes with them, and need not then be read at all. A list of officers nominated by a committee is to be treated in the same way. Each name is treated as a separate paragraph in the report. If a name is presented to which the assembly object, or upon which they do not wish to act, they can amend the report by postponing the consideration of such a name, or striking it out, or substituting for it some other name. It hardly need be said that nominations for office in a Masonic lodge by a nominating committee is seldom resor ted to. 33. COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. When an assembly desires to consider a subject with all the freedom of an ordinary committee, the subject not being sufficiently matured for definite action, nor one which it wishes to refer to a committee, a very desirable way is to refer the matter to a “committee of the whole “ This name is given because, under this move, the whole assembly is transformed into a committee and the chairman im - mediately calls some member to take the chair as chair - man of the committee, while he takes his place as a member of the committee. A Masonic lodge cannot go into a “committee of the whole” and transact business legally. The same result may, however, be attained by “informal consideration” of the question, when the usual parliamentary rules are suspended as long as no one objects. “From this principle that the Master, when present, must always preside over his lodge, arises the rule that a Masonic lodge can never, under any circumstance. be resolved into a committee of the whole. Lodges can only do business with the Master in the Chair; for, let who will p?bside, he is, while occupying the Chair, Master—in - vested with supreme command, and emphatically ‘governs the lodge.’ Any committee presupposes a chairman, and no Freemason would feel at home were he presided over by a chairman. This single fact is conclusive. “—Mackey. 34. INFORMAL AertoN. It is customary in some assemblies to consider a question “informally,” instead of going into a committee of the whole. During informal action the only motions that can be made are “to amend” and “to adopt.” While acting informally any motion except to amend or adopt puts an end to informal action. The form of the motion is, “that the question be con - sidered informally.” While the consideration of the question and its amendments is informal, all votes are formal, and the instant the main question is disposed of temporarily, or permanently, the informal consideration automatically ceases. OTHER MATTERS. 35. DEBATE. The member upon whose motion a subject is brought before the lodge is first entitled to the floor, although another member may have risen first and addressed the Master; and the member who presents the report of a committee is entitled to close the debate. It is a general rule that no member can speak the second time to a question until every other member who wishes to speak has spoken. The maker of a motion may vote against his own motion but isnot allowed to speak against it."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"366 Parliamentary Law Parliamentary Law 367 36. UNDEBATABLE. In addition to the motions marked undebatable in the table it might here be added that all motions relating to priority of business, or granting leave to continue his speech to one guilty of indecorum in debate, are undebatable. The main question cannot be debated while amendment is pending, only as therein involved. 37. To CLOSE DEBATE. Any one of the following ways may be taken: To object to considering the question (see table for rules); to lay it on the table; to move the previous question (not allowable in a Masonic Lodge); to adopt an order limiting debate (preferred form in a Masonic Lodge), or fixing time when it shall close. Debate is not closed by the Master rising to put the question, for until both the affirmative and negative votes are taken, a member can claim the floor, and re-open debate. 38. PUTTING THE QuEsTiON. The Master shall distinctly submit every motion to the decision of the lodge by such formula as the following: “As many as are in favor of this motion [or of the adoption of this resolution] will manifest it by raising the hand.” “Those opposed will show the same sign.” Or, “Those in favor,” etc., “will say, ‘Aye’.” “Those opposed, ‘No’.” The Master should always announce the result of the vote saying, if decided in the affirmative, “The motion is carried;’ or, “The resolution is adopted;” or “The ayes have it. The motion is carried,” etc If decided in the negative, “The motion [or resolution] is lost;” or “The noes have it The motion [or resolintion] is lost.” In case of a number voting on both sides of the question, the Master might say, “The ayes [noes] seem to have it. [Waits a moment.] The motion is carried [lost].” Should any one call for a division the Master immediately puts the question again calling upon those voting to raise the hand or to rise. If it is found, even after the Master had announced the vote, that a member had arisen and addressed the Chair before the negatsve had been put, he is entitled to be heard if debate had not been formally closed, and then the question is in the same condition as if it had never been put. In case of a tie vote the motion fails, unless the Master, who then casts his vote, decides it in the affirm- ative. If his vote will make a tie he can cast it, and thus defeat the measure. In some Masonic jurisdictions the Master is, by special rule, given this night to the “casting vote,” in addition to his vote as a member. If the vote is by ballot the Master writes his ballot with the rest. The votes having been collected and counted by the tellers, at least two in number who have been appointed to distribute the blanks and collect the ballots, they hand their report to the Master, who announces the result in this manner: “The whole number of votes cast is necessary for a choice ; Bro. A received ... . ; Bro. B and Bro. C Bro is consequently elected.” (Provided he received the majority necessary for a choice.) 39. TWO-THIRDS VOTE. In addition to the motions named in the table it requires a two-thirds vote to amend the rinles and to talce up a question out of its proper order OFFIcERs AND DUTIES. 40. THE MASTER. The Master should rise to put a questioni to vote, but may state it sitting. In view of the peculiar prerogatives and powers of the Master of a Masonic Lodge and his duty “to nile and govern his lodge” the editor can see no breach of parliamentary etiquette in using the phrase “I decide,” or “It is my opinion,” rather than the phrase “The Chair decides” or “The Chair is of the opinion.” There can, of course, be little objection to using the latter forms in the lodge if desired. A motion referring especially to the Master and proper to be considered should be put to vote by the Senior Warden. The Master may, if he wishes to vacate the Chair for a time, call another brother to preside, providing the rules of the local jurisdiction are not in conflict. Some brethren have thought that by reason of his prerogative and duty “to rule and govern” his lodge the power of the Master is arbitrary and unlimited within his own lodge; that he needs no code of laws or parlia - mentary insage to control his actions. In this they are mistaken. There is a formidable body of both written and unwritten law in Masonry and a Master to he worthy of"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Parliamentary Law 369 Parliamentary Law 368 the title should not accept the office without some under - standing of the codes and statutes of the order. It is true he is not responsible directly to his lodge ot to the brethren who elected him but he is responsible to the Grand Master or Grand Lodge and subject to discipline by them. For grave infractions of the law he may even endanger the Charter of his lodge. In his vows of office he has solemnly bound himself “strictly to conform to every edict of the Grand Lodge” not subversive of Masonry and “submit to the awards and resoiutiotls of your brethren, in lodge convened.” He received the By-laws of the lodge which he was charged “to see carefully and punctu - ally exeduted.” In the vows of a Past Master he obligated himself “not to govern his lodge in an arbitrary or uncon - stitutional manner.” Thus, it is seen, the unusual power of the Master is NOT an arbitrary one but subject to numerous restrictions which must be carefully observed. In fine, as said in the installation charge, he should be “one to whom the burdened heart may pour forth its sorrows, to whom the distressed may prefer their suit, whose hand is guided by justice and heart is expanded by benevolence.” 4t. SEcFETARv. The duties of the Secretary have been provided for in minute detail in many jurisdictions and that officer should carefully review the provisions of the laws of the Grand Lodge and the by-laws of his own lodge governing his office. Even the form for his minute book is frequently set forth. He should record all the proceedings of the lodge proper to be written; that is, all the action taken by the lodge in a deliberative capacity; and should enter upon the records every “principal motion,” whether carried or lost, unless otherwise instructed, for it is often as important to know what measures were introduced and lost as what ones were carried. He should hand to the chairman of every com - mittee appointed, or to some member thereof, a list of the brethren composing said committee and a statement of the matter referred to them. He should, previous to each meeting, make out for the use of the Master, an order of business, showing in its order what is necessary to come before the meeting; should have a list of all com - mittees in existence, standing or special, and should attest the minutes at the left hand side of the page, presenting them, when approved by the lodge, for signature by the Master on the right hand side. VALUE OF THE RULES. 42. QUOTATION FROM JEFFERSON’S MANUAL, a digest of the rules of deliberative bodies “by which I judge and am willing to be judged: “And whether these forms be in all cases the most rational or not, is really not of so great importance. It is much more material that there should be a rule to go by, than what that iule is; that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in business not sinbiect to the caprice of the Speaker or captiousness of the members. It is very material that order, decency, and regularity be preserved in a dignified public body.”"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Funeral Dirge Music—Pleyel’s Hymn. Jb Q~..
