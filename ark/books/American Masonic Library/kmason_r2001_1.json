Given the limited frequency of the meetings of Knight Mason Councils in the U. S. A. and the busy schedules of the pa rticipants in their labors, the Ritual Committee has determined that a more detailed and descriptive instructional document is necessary to preclude misinter pretation of our ritual and floor work and to reduce the necessity for frequent rehear sals to maintain the desired level of perfection in presenting the Work of the Order . it is to this end, that this manual has been prepared.

Carry Swords This position is to the right side of the body, with the upper arm vertical against the body, the forearm at right angles to it and parallel with the floor, the sword pointing vertically upwards. Present Swords At the command “Swords”, raise and carry the Sword to the front. The cross of the hilt of the Sword should be located at chin level, the edge of the Sword blade to the left, and the point of the Sword inclined forward approximately six inches from the vertical. All fingers should be grasping the grip; the thumb is extended on the Grip to the right, about one inch from the chin. Dividing the Sign During the opening ceremony, all Sir Knights will be instructed to divide the sign. Members on the sidelines, attired wi th swords, will cross their swords at breast level with that of their neighboring Brother Knight — about halfway up the blade, making an angle of approximatel y sixty degrees between the blades. Members not situated next to a Brother Knight, should place their sword across and inside their left forearm, both being in front of the body at breast level, again forming an angle of about sixty degrees. Completing the Sign The sign is completed in both instances, when acknowledged by the Excellent Chief by returning your sword to the carry position. Depress Swords The attitude for prayer is adopted when the Junior Warden commands “Sir Knights, depress swords.” You should lower the point of the sword and your right forearm so that they form a straight lin e at an angle of about forty—five degrees to the vertical. After prayer, the comma nd is given to “Carry swords” again. Sign of Assent The sign of Assent is used during the Degree of Knight of the Sword, and is given by taking a pace forward with the right foot at the same time lowering the poInt of the sword (as in the Depr ess Swords position; then raising the sword with the arm still straight until the sword is almost Vertical, after which the right foot is withdrawn and the sword returned to the carry position. vii"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"viii Return Swords On the command “Return”, you should guide the tip of your sword back into the scabbard and continue until about ten inches of the blade is still exposed, then await the command “Swords” so that all Sir Knights will complete the final movement at the same time.

The history of the Judean people. as cont ained in the Roll of the law , records three outstanding episodes intimately connected w ith Irish Universal Masonry (1) The building of King Solomon’s Temple — Craft Masonry (2) The repairs by King Josiah — Irish Roy al Arch Masonry (3) The building of the Second Temple by Z after the return from captivity in Baby lon — Knight Masonry So by becoming a Knight Mason y ou are completing a sequence intimately related to the teaching of Masonry There are three Degrees in Knight M asonry now know n as Knight of the Sw ord, Knight of the East, and Knight of the East and West, and in this Degree of Knight of the Sw ord y ou have taken the prin cipal part in demonstrating one of the greatest feats of faith and courage recorded in the entire history of these peoples. In the Book of Jeremiah w e read w here that prophet foretold the destruction of the Temple and that the people w ould ser ve the King of Baby lon for a period of seventy years, before being permitted to return to Jerusalem: In about the y ear 606 B.C.E. the prophesy began to be fulfilled. In that y ear Nebuchadnezzar conquered Judea and removed the bulk of the inhabitants to captivity in Baby lon. Rabbinical tradition tells that the J udean people (in captivity ) carefully preserved and handed dow n all their lege nds, prophesies and traditions and so, when 70 y ears later about 536 B.C.E., Ki ng Cy rus conquered Baby lon, the Judean people saw in the changed conditions the ha nd of God interfering to bring about the end of the captivity and the return to Jerusalem This faith that Jeremiah’s prophesy would be fulfilled w as strongly held by the Judean people. At that time there w as “one Z” a Prince of the House of David, so strong in his faith that, at great persona l risk, he undertook the journey to the Persian capital to plead w ith King Cy rus for the release of his people. As soon as he had reached the capital, he w as made captive, put in chains and brought to the centre of government. 19"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The announcement of a captive in chains at the Persian court reminded King Cy rus of a dream he had had. So remarkab le w as the coincidence that he summoned his councilors, related the dream to them a nd asked them to interpret it and advise him. (Note:— The dream should be retold at this point.) His councilors saw in the dream that Cy rus had been vouchsafed a vision of his predecessors suffering for the w rongs they had inflicted on the Judean people, and in The lion, w hich they recognized as th e emblem of Judah, the fate that w ould overtake Cy rus should he continue in their footsteps. And so w hen they w ere asked if the Captive should be interrogated they gladly signified that he should be. Cy rus then received him graciously , hear d his request and offered to grant them all on the one condition that he w oul d reveal to him the secrets of Masonry — an Order he said, to w hich he did not be long but one w hich he alw ays held in high esteem, Without hesitation, Z. replied “No, my engagements are inviolable. If my liberty is to be thus purchased, I prefer cap tivity .” This w as an extremely courageous reply , for the King w as an absolute monarc h w ith pow ers of life and death over his subjects, and he could easily have ordered Z’s execution. This reply could also have postponed indefinitely any chance of ending the Captivity in Baby lon How ever, the dignity of Z’s reply so impressed the King that he granted all his requests w ithout any conditions w hatsoever. He w ent furthe r and by creating hi m a Knight of the Sw ord, he admitted him a member of his ow n Order of Chivalry and invested him with the insignia of the Order. Z’s mission w as now completed and he t ook leave of the Persian court, and returned to his people in Baby lon, w ho re joiced greatly at the new s he had brought. They began making arrangements for an early return to Jerusalem. We w ere told at that time fort y and tw o thousand, three hundred and threescore left Baby lon. It took some four months and they w ere continually harassed by the unfriendly people w ho lived in those part s, but especially by their enemies w ho brought them to battle at the Bridge across the river. In this fight Z. w as despoiled of the green sash w ith w hich Cy rus had invested him but he retained his sw ord and eventua lly secured the bridgehead and his people journey ed on, still suffering hardships a nd hostilities but pressing on in the hope that they would take part in the glorious w ork of rebuilding the Temple.

In the degree of Knight of the Sw ord, Cy rus w as so impressed by Z, that he granted permission to rebuild the Temple, but he did not give protection to the w orkmen from their unfriendly neighbours. There w as one among those present on that occasion w ho formed an intimate friendship w ith Z, and made a vow that if ever he should succeed to the throne of Persia and if Jerusalem w as still unbuilt. that he w ould see to the building of it. He w as Prince Darius, not then in the direct line of succession, The hostility of the neighbouring peoples gr eatly impeded the w ork during Cy rus’s reign, but w orse w as to follow . When his son Camby ses succeeded him, these people hired scribes to w rite to the new King. It is a long letter, (in Ezra, Chapter 4) w hich succeeded in convey ing to the King that the Jew s w ere never a peaceful nation and that their building programme w as suspect. The King looked up their history and decreed that all building should cease, and so it re mained for the remainder of his reign. After his accidental death a usurper seized the throne, but after a few months he w as deposed and Darius w as enthroned — the same Prince w ho had made the vow about rebuilding Jerusalem. As soon as Z. w as sure that the new King w as his one time friend he restarted the building. The Satraps came and demanded w hy he disobey ed the late King’s edict. Z decided to pay a second visit to the Persia n court and demand the King’s justice. His reception by Darius w as sy mbolically enacted in the earlier part of this degree. Although it w as sixteen y ears since the tw o ha d met, there is little doubt that Darius remembered him, for— Firstly he ordered a search to be made for Cy rus’s degree, and when it w as read he confirmed it. Secondly he granted the protection needed for the builders. And thirdly he conferred tw o great honours on Z — he created him a Knight of the East and made him a member of his ow n body guard, a distinction hitherto reserved for and coveted by his ow n subjects.

These were not orgies of dissolution as those of Babylon as described in the Book of Daniel They would correspond to a modern Commonwealth Conference, to which the Princes and Governors of the Provinces would come to make their reports, discuss their problems and receive fresh instructions. These feasts would last several days until the business was completed, and when evening came their refreshment board became a cultural and educational centre at which metaphysical problems were proposed and discussed. Once this question was posed:— “Which is the greatest Wine, the King or Women?” so when the King retired at night, he asked his Bodyguard — one of whom it is important to remember was Z — to answer the question and promised honours and rewards to him who should answer best.

In the instructions y ou received in The degree of Knight of The East y ou w ere told that the three degrees of Knight Masonry were dovetailed or linked together and the first such connecting link w as pointed out to you in the degree of Knight of The East. Here y ou learned that The Passw ord of The degree of Knight of the Sw ord became the Secret Word of the degree of Knight of the East, w hen accompanied by a certain grip. A similar connecting link exists betw een the degree of Knight of the East and this degree, the Knight of the East and West. The Grand Word of the Knight of the East becomes the Passw ord of this degree, but accompanied by a different grip. (Dem onstrate grip) Of the original tw elve tribes of Israel, there remained, at the time of the destruction of King Solomon’s Temple, tw o main tribes and it w as these tribes w ho w ere carried into captivity and after seventy years returned to Jerusalem to build the second Temple. These tw o tribes w ere Judah and Benjamin. You heard the names mentioned w hen the Priest read Ezra, Chapter 1, Verse 5, a few moments ago. These names form the Secret Word of this degree, and are divided, accompanied by the same grip as the Passw ord. (Dem onstrate) The sign of this degree is tw ofold, a si gn and a counter— sign, w ith the counter— sign being given only by the Excellent Chief. (Dem onstrate) The sign and the counter— sign remind us of the w atered silk sashes y ou w ore as a Knight of the Sw ord and as a Knight of the East. The knocks are given in this manner. (Dem onstrate) You w ill notice that the secrets have taken on a familiar pattern. Passw ord and grip, Secret Word and grip, signs and knocks, similar to w hat y ou had in y our earIier degrees in Freemasonry . The tw o earlier degrees of Knight Masonry are sy mbolic pageants, demonstrating w hat took place in the courts of the great Kings. This third degree is represented as taking place before a CounciI of Knight Masons in Jerusalem, before w hom Zerubbabel presents himself to inform them of the satisfactory completion of his jour ney to the court of King Darius. As a rew ard for his labours he is created a Knight of East and West. So in this Council every thing has a familiar Masonic appearance. We are presided over by an Excellent Chief dressed in exactly the same regalia as the rest of the Sir Knights, rather than as a Great and Mighty King, dressed in gorgeous robes, as in the previous degrees; y ou w ere announced here as a Brother rather than as “One Zerubbabel”; and y ou w ere asked to demonstrate w ithin the Council that y ou had in fact received the earlier degrees of Freemasonry . 48"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"I w ould now like to digress for a moment and talk about the time y ou first entered Freemasonry . You w ere hoodw inked; the significance of this is fairly clear w hen y ou think about it. The Judean people received much enlightenment w ith the building of King Solomon’s Temple, as y ou entered Masonry hoodw inked, sy mbolically to receive enlightenment When the long lost Roll of the Law was discovered during the repair of that Temple by King Josiah, the people saw light again after a long period of darkness, and y ou again w ere hoodw inked and in darkness w hen you w ere admitted to be exalted to the degree of Roy al Arch Mason. Again there w as great enlightenment w hen the second Temple w as built, contrasting with the darkness of the captivity which had gone before. Again y ou w ere hoodw inked and in darkness before being admitted to be created a Knight of the Sw ord. The sy mbolic significance is obvious! Four y ears after the events depicted in th is degree, the Temple w as completed and dedicated, having taken tw enty years in all to build from the return from captivity . These degrees deal w ith a most interesting period in Judean history , but to understand properly their sy mbolic significance it is important to remember that the first tw o are represented as taking place at the courts of tw o Persian Kings, neither of w hom w as a Mason. In the degree of Knight of the Sw ord in the presence of King Cy rus, w e have represented to us the most outsta nding example of Masonic Fidelity . In the degree of Knight of the East are di splay ed play ed faith and courage It took no small courage to proclaim to the assembled courtiers of King Darius, the most pow erful King that Persia had ever know n, that there w as something greater than their King. In the degree of Knight of the East and West the fidelity , faith and courage of Zerubbabel are finally rew arded, as w e believe such virtues must alw ays be. In the Books of Ezra, Nehemiah and Haggai, w e are reminded that though the Jew s were in captivity for seventy years and w ere forbidden to leave Baby lon, it w as a nominal captivity . They were allow ed to ow n land, take part in trade and commerce, and to be active in the political life of Ba by lon. Many of them rose to positions of pow er and w ealth in the land. ln general they had experienced nothing but peace and prosperity , and one can understand the tremendous attraction that a w ealthy and fertile country would have for such a people as the Jew s. Yet notw ithstanding all these w orldly attract ions, they rise and leave all that behind them and undertake a hazardous journey through a desert country , sw arming w ith their hereditary enemies, to settle in a land la id desolate by war. In reading all this in 49"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"50 the Book of Ezra, one naturally asks why did the Jews do This? Why did they appear to sacrifice themselves, their interests and their prospects in such a way? The degrees of Knight Masonry provide us with an answer. It was solely in order that they might prosecute the search for truth and worship according to their faith in the home and Temple of their fathers. By that journey they had demonstrated to the world of those days that the main object in life for them was the search for truth. Zerubbabel proclaimed to the assembled courtiers of King Darius that there was no greater power on earth, it was greater than all the worldly power they could imagine their King to possess. “As for truth” he exclaimed “it endureth and is always strong. It liveth and conquereth for ever more.” (Note: The Candidate is now seated in the Sout h, and is then saluted as a Knight of the East and West.)"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" GRAND COUNCIL of KNIGHT MASONS of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA  COUNCIL OF KNIGHT MASONS RESUMPTION OF LABOR 51"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"RESUMPTION OF LABOR IN A KNIGHT MASON’S COUNCIL E.

EXAMPLE OF INSTRUCTION You have now received the three Degrees of Knight Masonry and having just seen the closing of the Council of Knights of th e East and West, y ou may be puzzled by the fact that w e are still at labour. When y ou attended to receive the Degree of Knight of the Sw ord and Knight of the East; before y ou w ere admitted, a Council of Knight Masons w as opened, follow ing which a Council of Knights of the Sw ord w as opened. You received y our Degree and the Council of Knights of the Sw ord w as closed. A Council of Knights of the East w as then opened and y ou w ere admitted to receive the Degree of Knight of the East, and then the Council of Knights of the East w as closed. Subsequently , the Council of Knight Masons w as closed. On this occasion, before y ou w ere admitte d, a Council of Knight Masons w as opened here, and subsequently a Council of Knights of the East and West w as opened. You w ere admitted and, w hen y ou had received y our degree, y ou saw the Council of Knights of the East and West closed. You w ill later be present w hen the Council of Knight Masons is closed. Thus y ou see that the Councils of Knight of the Sw ord, Knight of the East and Knight of the East and West alw ays work w ithin a Council of Knight Masons at labour. The historical reasons for this are interest ing. In olden day s all the degrees including these Knight Mason degrees w ere given in Craft Lodges. Various Grand bodies w ere eventually formed to take charge of the higher degrees, and in Ireland these Knight Mason degrees w ere taken over by the Great Priory . In Scotland these degrees w ere in the charge of the Roy al Arch, w hile in other constitutions degrees similar to these are also found. The important point is that w hen these degrees w ere given, it w as alw ays within another Masonic body at labour. Thus, w hen the Grand Council of Knight Mas ons w as constituted in Ireland in the early 1920’s to take charge of these degrees, it w as necessary to provide a body within w hich the Councils of Knights of th e Sw ord, Knights of the East and Knights of the East and West could w ork, and that body is a Council of Knight Masons. 54"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" I referred earlier to the fact that these degrees used to be given in Ireland by the Preceptories and are currently given in Scotland in the Roy al Arch Chapter and that similar degrees are still given under other Constitutions. It is only as the degrees are now given under the lrish Constitution that they ore given m the correct chronological sequence. When y ou next attend a Council meeting, y ou w ill be present for the opening of a Council of Knight Masons, so it is necessary that y ou be instructed in the secrets and met method of w orking of that body . How ever I must remind y ou that the Obligation y ou have just taken covered the secrets of Knight Masonry , as w ell as those of the Degree of Knight of the East and West. Firstly , there is a passw ord. That w ord is S.............. You w ill find it in the last verse of the first chapter of Ezra Throughout these degrees y ou have represented Zerubbabel, w hich w as his Baby lonian name, but he w as a Prince of the House of Judah, and so had a Court name. That name w as S............ Y ou must remember that name for y ou w ill have to whisper it to one of the Wardens each ti me a Council of Knight Masons is being opened. I w ill now instruct y ou in the use of the sw ord. The first command w hich y ou w ill hear given is “Sir Knights, draw sw ords.” On this you w ill draw your sw ord and bring it to the position know n as the carry , this is to the right side of the body , w ith the upper arm vertical against the body , the forearm at right angles to it and parallel w ith the floor, the sw ord pointing vertically upw ards. Later during the opening ceremony all the Knights w ill be instructed to divide the sign; this is done by crossing y our sw ord w ith that of y our neighboring Brother Knight — about half— w ay up the blade, making an angle of approximately sixty degrees betw een the blades. If y ou are on y our ow n, y ou should place y our sw ord across and inside y our Left forearm, both being in front of y our body , again forming an angle of about sixty degrees. The sign is completed in both instances, w hen acknow ledged by the Excellent Chief by returning y our sw ord to the carry position. The attitude for pray er is adopted w hen the Junior Warden commands “Sir Knights, depress sw ords.” You should low er the point of the sw ord and y our right forearm so that they form a straight line at an angle of about forty — five degrees to the vertical. After pray er the command is given to “Carry sw ords” again. 55"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" The sign of Assent is used during the Degree of Knight of the Sw ord, and is given by taking a pace forw ard w ith the right foot at the same time low ering the point of the sw ord (as in the attitude for pray er); then raising the sw ord w ith the arm still straight until the sw ord is almost vertical, after w hich the right foot is w ithdraw n and the sw ord returned to the carry position. The Retiring Salute is called by the Second Captain of the Guard w hen the Officers of the Council are about to retire at the conclusion of the meeting. The sw ord is brought across the body so that the right hand is over the left breast and the sw ord is still pointing vertically The Second Captain of the Guard w ill command all Knights to carry sw ords before the final command of “Return sw ords” is given. On the command “Return sw ords”, y ou should guide the tip of y our sw ord back into the scabbard and continue until about ten inches of the blade is still exposed, then aw ait a signal from the Junior Warden so th at all Sir Knights w ill complete the final movement at the same time. If y ou are required to salute the Excellent Chief w ithout y our sw ord in hand, y ou should place y our right forearm across and inside y our left forearm in the position in which y our sw ord blade w ould otherw ise have been. The Knocks of the various Degrees are now exp lained. Knight of the Sw ord, Knight of the East, Knight of the East and West and Council of Knight Masons. As a Knight Mason, y ou now have the right to propose candidates. The qualification for joining is being a Roy al Arch Mason for one y ear.

There are Councils throughout Ireland. There are many Knight Masons Councils in America and y ou w ill find others in Hong K ong, and in Western and Southern Africa.
