THE GROTTO BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION The Mystic Order Veiled Prophets of the En - chanted Realm, whose subordinate bodies are called Grottoes, is an organization originated by and for Master Masons. While in no way connect - ed with Masonry proper, its membership is re - stricted absolutely and exclusively to Master Masons in good standing. While it is primarily an organization for good, wholesome fun and frolic it also has its serious side. Its slogan is GOOD FELLOWSHIP, and in our contact with our fellow man this principle is exemplified to a marked degree. 1"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT IT IS—ITS PURPOSE A number of Grottoes own their own temples and many have one or more auxiliaries, such as uniformed bands, drill corps, drum and bugle corps, glee clubs and marching unit;s, and when on parade present a colorful appearance. Through the medium of these auxiliary units the Grottoes provide entertainment not; only for their own members, but for the Masonic and allied bodies. HISTORIC The Order was organized in the early part of the year 1899 at Hamilton, N. Y., as a local or - ganization, by members of, and as an adjunct to, Hamilton Lodge No. 120, F. & A. M. But the founders builded better than they knew. It was so good and filled such a unique position that it spread rapidly and soon became a national, and later an international organization. The Grottoes are governed by a Supreme Council which meets in annual convention, the convention city being selected each year by the delegates and members composing the Supreme Council. THE RITUAL The ritual is original and unique. Its proper rendition requires a large stage, elaborate cos - bimes and stage settings. It is mysterious, start - ling and spectacular. While pervaded throughout with a spirit of wholesome fun, it teaches a seri - ous lesson which lingers with the initiate, instills a spirit of optimism, a kindly feeling for his brother man, and impresses him that GOOD FELLOWS RIP is something devoutly to be desired. The Grotto is a playground for the Master Mason and all such are welcome to our enchanted realm. While it is not, and no claim is made that it; is a Masonic degree, or part of symbolic Ma - sonry, we ever bear in mind that our membership is composed entirely of Master Masons and we conduct ourselves accordingly. We do claim, how - ever, and with no small amount of pride, that the Grotto has a mission, serves a useful purpose and t;hat it is decidedly worth while. There are more than 150 Grottoes in existence, with a combined membership of approximately 100,000. The Order has a definite program of huniani - tarian work but prohib[ts assessment of its mem - bers for such purposes, the work done and amounts contributed being voluntary on the part of the individual Prophets. Man in all walks of life craves companionship. He strives to broaden his knowledge of things and enlarge his acquaintance among men. We, as • Masons, endeavor to broaden our knowledge, ex - tend our acquaintance and association with our brethren. It needs no argument to prove that com - panionship tends to promote man’s welfare and happiness, and the more companionship among members of any organization, just so much stronger is the institution to which they belong. The Grotto furnishes just such opportunity. It provides a common meeting place where Masons of all degrees can meet, mingle, fraternize and indulge in pure, clean, wholesome fun and frolic, 3 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"without trespassin” upon or detracting from the solemn dignity of the Lodge. Brother meets brother upon the basis of true Good Fellowship. Before the candidate knocks at our portals his standing in the community and sincerity of pur - pose is pre-avouched, for he is a Master DAason in good standing. Once admitted, and our mysteries unfolded, the teachings of the Grotto can only tend to make him a better man and a better Mason. Thus the Grotto keeps alive the fraternal spirit so much desired and which is so essentially necessary to the welfare of any organization. Some of the warmest and strongest friendships have had their inception in the Grotto; men have met and become life-long companions who perhaps never would have met otherwise. If the Grotto did nothing more than to cement; the ties of friendship, broad - en our acquaintance among the Craft and enlarge our Masonic association, it would have performed a mission, won its place in the sun and should con - vince the most skeptical that it is really worth while. The Grotto has done all of this. The Grotto is real; it is earnest; it is worth while. The Grotto atmosphere is surcharged with friendship, which is man’s most valued asset. The man without friends is a derelict and floats lone - somely down the stream of life like a rudderless ship, but the man who has real friends is to be envied more than the man who is rich in gold, because he possesses that which gold cannot buy. As one writer has aptly said: “The Grotto is the Temple to which we repair, taking with us our troubles, our worries and our cares; we lay them before the Venerable Prophet upon the altar of fire, where they are consumed, and in their stead we receive ‘divine, heart-easing mirth.’” Could a prettier sentiment be imagined? With such prin - ciples and objects, is it any wonder that the Order has spread to nearly every State in the Union and into Canada? Is it strange that the Prophets wear a happy smile and are at peace with all the world? That the Grotto occupies a legitimate place and is doing a wonderful work cannot be denied. It ex - tends the hand of Good Fellowship to all Master Masons, has a smile for all and a frown for none. We have something worth while for every Master Mason and we bid you welcome to our realm. It is just as natural for a man to crave recrea - tion, companionship and good, wholesome fun as it is for sparks to fly upward. The Grotto offers all this, in full measure, heaping and running over. God made two kinds of animals. One lives in a shell, the other does not. Man belongs to the latter species. The animal of the shell variety is content with his limited vision and such fun and pleasure as can be obtained by crawling on the ocean’s bottom. But man, whom God has made upright, is not content to grope in the darkness. He wants light, and all the light that he can obtain. He is a reasoning being. He craves greater, better and nobler things. He lives in the open, not in a shell. He has high ideals, he is inquisitive, he investi - gates, he prospects, and holds on to that which is good. Man’s days on earth are few and beset with many troubles. But, withal, there is happiness for those who seek it. Life is largely what we niak~ 5 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"it. - How will you spend your days? Will you en - deavor to enjoy them?
