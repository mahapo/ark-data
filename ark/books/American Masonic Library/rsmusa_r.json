K. of T., and H. the A., who, in addition to the title of G. M., was designated the P. C. of the ‘XV. The two K. were so attached to their associate that, in view of his age, character and fame, and as a special mark of their affection and esteem, they called him “A ,“ or, “Ab ,“ which means “ my father.” In that G. C. everything was determined in relation to the construction of the T., and the government of the workmen. Three years previous to the completion of the T.,the G. C. decided to communicate the M. ‘XV. to those Craftsmen who had distinguished themselves by their industry, fidelity and skill, and it was also agreed that the ‘XV. should not he given until the completion of the T., and then only in the presence, and with the consent, of’ the three G. M. In order that the ~V. might be preserved for future ages, shoteld anything occur prior to the completion of the T. to prevent its communication to the Craft, H.

A. to enter the T. for prayer, and also to inspect the progress of the work, and, if necessary, draw fresh designs upon the trestle-board. On one of these occasions he was met at the S. G. of the T. by his inti - mate friend A., who said, ‘‘G. M. H. A., “when shall I receive the M. W. ?“ H. A. replied, “ My worthy friend Ad., I do not know that you will ever receive it, for it has been agreed by S. K. of I., II. K. of T., and myself, that the W. shall not be given until the completion of the T., and then only in the presence, and with the consent, of all three.” Ad. answered, “ G. M. H.

It was not, however, irrecoverably ]ost, but remained c., until discovered as related in the R. A. D. As the d. of H. A. prevented the s. G. M. from com - municating the W., a S. was given in its place. In memory of H. A. this D. of R. M. was instittited, and the G. P., representing a B. T., adopted, with the P. XV. of the D. A. P. H., the exclama - tion of K. S. when informed of his M. Such is the lgd of this D. The S. \\V. of the T. D. is a corruption of the compound word M A 0. M h means Emanation from, begotten of, Seed, Progeny, Child, or Son. A B meanr Fat/icr. 0 N means God. The first two words are Hebrew, and the last word is the Greek form of the ancient Egyptian, as well as Hindoo, name of the Deity. The three words compounded into one are interpreted to mean the Son of God the Father. He is the true Word. The name of the A. S. N., J., J., J., are corruptions of the word G., and mean three 0. 5. 5. or F. C. * * The principal symbols of F. M. are those derived from K. S.’s temple and the religious ceremonies of the ancient Hebrews, and we know them to be of Divine origin. What are the true meanings of these symbols? The temple itself was a grand symbol, representing humanity in its progress under Divine guidance towards perfection. The two pillars of the porch, B in the northeast corner and J in the southeast corner, guarded the only entrance to the temple. Representing the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire, which guided the Israelites through the wilderness to the promised land, they symbolized the Divine leadership. The holy place, in its form of an oblong square, symbolized man’s state of imperfection. In the north 5 tood the table of shewhread. In the south the golden candlestick, and in the west, opposite the centr~ of the vail leading to the holy of holies, the altar of incense, the three forming a triangle symbolizing the trinity in unity. These, separately, were symbols of the Deity— the shewbread as the bread of life, the candlestick as the light of life, and the altar of incense as the mediator, in whom life and light are united. They pointed the worshiper to the holy of holies, which rose from a higher level than the holy place, and, from its uniform sym - metry of a perfect cube, symbolized the state of man and the kingdom of God in perfection. Here, as the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse is represented to he, the length. breadth and height were equal. Here was the earthly dwelling-place of the Deity, and the only light was the manifestation of the Divine presence. Here stood the ark, with the mercy-seat overshadowing it, covering which were the outspread wings of the cherubim, and, between the cherubim, the visible manifestation of the Deity, supposed to be the ineffable name of Jehovah, in characters of fire, and called by the ancient Hebrews the Shekimah and the Word. It is said that the rays of light from the Shekinah, falling on the stones of the breastplate of the High Priest as he stood before the ark, indicated the Divine will in the form designated as the language of Urim and Thummim. Two other cherubim stood on either side of the ark, the wing of one touching"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"23 I ~1 22 one wall, and the wing of the other touching the other wall, their wings meeting in the midst of the house. The ark was the earthly throne of the Deity, and, to show that this was its final resting-place, the staves, on which it had been borne, were drawn out, so as to appear through the vail, and they served to guide the steps of the High Priest in his yearly entrance into the chamber. The cedar or acacia, of which the ark was made, being one of the most imperish - able kinds of wood, was the symbol of life. The ark symbolized the preservation of the race, and the mercy-seat and cherubim symbolized the protecting care of the Deity. The ark rested on the bare rock, which ‘vas the summit of the mountain. Beneath it a vault had been opened, the purpose of which will be considered in the final degree of S. M. The sacrifice of the lamb without blemish symbolized the ancient promise, coming down from the earliest ages and through all nations, that the Deity, incarnate as the seed of the woman, should become the expiatory offcring for the sins of the ~voPld. According to the ancient Hcbrcw Rabbis, the blood of the slain lamb was sprin - kled on the consecrated bread and the sacred utensils of the temple in the form of a cross, and the same symbolic figure of the cross was used in anointing the High Priests and the Kings. rfhe glory of the temple was the Shdkinah, or the Word. Accord - ing to the ancient Hebrews, by the Word the world was created, the law given to Moses, Israel brought out of Egypt, and guided through the wilderness to the promised land, and for the earthly dwelling- place of the Word K. S. was permitted to build the temple. The Word, or, as generally designated, Jehovah, is the greatest name by which God has been pleased to make Himself known. From the burning, yet unconsumed, bush in the desert came the voice of God to Moses, saying: “ Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob bath sent me unto you. This is my Name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.” In the common English version of this passage, the name Jehovah is translated “ I ala that I am.” The interpretation of the name Jehovah is given in Exodus, thirty-fourth chapter, fifih, sixth and seventh verses: “ And the Lord descended in the cloud, and pro - claimed the name of Jehovah, the Lord God full of compassion and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression and sin, and who ~vill by no means clear the guilty.” The Hebrews called the name Jehovah, from the number of its consonants, the tetragram - maton or four.lettered-uame, and, from its peculiar sacredness, the ineffable, or, unutterable name. In common speech they substituted for it the word Adonai. In our English Scriptures it is represented by the word LORD printed in capital letters and also by the words, I am that I am.” The High Priest received the Word from his predecessor, and, that it miaht not be lost in the event of his sudden death, the pronunciation was communicated also to his assistant. Among the ancient Hebrews, owing to the absence of vowels in their language, the pronunciation of words was known only by oral teach - ing. According to our legends, the Word was known to K. S. and to his colleagues, H., K. of T., and H. A., at the period of the building of the temple. In his prayer of confession, on the great day of atonement the High Priest publicly pronounced the Word, or ineffable name, in a low voice, but the utterance was lost otnidst the responses of the priests and the noise of the trumpets. The Hebrew; felt a supersti - tious reverence for the name of Jehovah, and, after the Babylonisli captivity, they discontinued the use of it, except on special occasions, so that, in process of time, the true pronunciation was lost. In the Old Testament Scriptures there are many special references to the Word, or Name, of Jehovah. A number of these refer to Jerusalem as the place selected by God for the preservation of [us name, and designate the Temple as the house built for His name. The four IEI ebrew characters composing the name of Jehovah are represented in English by the letters J. H. V. H. This combination cannot be pronounced without the interjection of vowel sounds, and it is now uncertain what are the proper ones, or the order of their arrange - rnent. The abbreviated form of Jehovah is Jab. The more proper word is Yahovah, with the abbreviation of Yab, as the letter J is not known to the Hebrew language The first letter of the ineffable name, and its representative, is Yod, which, in English, is incorrectly rendered God. In the G~reek language, which is closely allied to the Hebrew, the ineffable name is expressed by the letters I, A, 0. I, or Iota, has the same meaning as J and Y and signifies unity. A, or Alpha, and 0, or Omega, are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet., and signify the beginning and the end. The Greek Iota —— I"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"24 25 is identical with the Hebrew Yod, and signifies that the Deity is the one and only God. A]pha signifies that the Deity is the begiunitig of all things in creation, and Omega that He is the end in the final consummation and restoration of all things. lao, Jao, Yao, Jah, Yah, Jhvh and Yhvh are identical, and represent the ineffable name of the Deity. It is supposed that the name Jehovah or Yahovah was the sacred word of the 0 M of the middle ages, and that it passed from them to the F M , who, early in the eighteenth century, attached it to the T. D. as the M. W., and that it continued to be the M. W. until the latter part of the same century, when it was trans - ferred to the R. A. It has since been attached to the degrees of the C. In F M ,the symbol of the Deity is the equi - lateral triangle. - * * * The C. N. D. in this D. represents a F. C. seeking to be rewarded for his labor by a knowledge of the W. My brother, when you passed the pillars of J. and B. in the -B. L., you entered the P. of the T. of F. M. When beneath the V. of the C. H., you stood within the H. P. You are now on the thresh - o]d of the S. S. You seek the reward of a true F. of the C. That reward is a knowledge of the NV., which is a knowledge of the Deity. By the fall the W. was lost to man, in bis present state, but not irrecoverably lost. You cannot, even now, comprehend its full significance, though you may understand much of its meaning, by a study of the handwriting of ihe Deity in the symbols of the uuwerse. When you pass from this earthly temple, may you, as a R. M. indeed, clothed as a High Priest after the order of Mel - chizedeck, be permitted to enter the heavenly holy of holies, and there forever adore Him, the true Word whose Name is above every other name. This may be used. M~ GOMPkNION: The first G. Council of Masons which assembled at Jerusalem was composed of S., K. of I., IL, K. of T., and H. A., who met together as such to deliberate upon the plans for the erection of the ‘A Temple on Mount Moriab, as revealed by the Word of God, and for the preservation of the G. 0. ~Vord. This Council was congregated by K. S.. who presided over its deliberations, and with their assistance devised the plans by which the Temple should be erected; and the various classes and degrees into which the workmen should be divided. Hence, in a chronological point of view, the Royal Master’s Degree, being a representation of the Supreme Grand Council of Royal Masters (because a majority of them were Kiugs~, was neces - sari 1 y the First Degree of Ancient Craft Masonry. But, for wise and mysterious purposes, the founders of our Fra - ternity resolved to place side by side the A. and 0. of A. C. M., the First and Last Degrees; because the connections between the First and Second Temples are so intimately interwoven in the concealment and preservation of the G. 0. W., the R. M. cannot exist without the S. M. The Masonic Traditions with which you will now become acquainted in the ~Council will comprehend every Tradition of Ancient Craft Masonry, and illustrate the connection between the Degrees of Lodge, Chapter and Council, and will furnish some precious memeutoes of our Ill. G. M., H. N., who~e history you will find in 1 Kings, 7th Chapter, commencing at the 13th verse. From the history of the Hebrews we learn that they had but one name for the Deity, which they held in such veneration that they never presumed to pronounce it, except in a mysP rious manner. This was the Original Word and principal Secret of a M. M., which was lost by the death of our G. M., H. A., but was restored at the building of the Second Temple. This Word can be found in the —th Psalm, and nowhere else in the B., while its true pronunciation and all the imposing and attending ceremonies were taught you in a Chapter of R. A. M. We are also informed that our Ill. G. Ms. held frequent consul - tations on the subject of communicating this Word to all M. Ms. wh~ should prove themselvesworthy by their Virtue, Skill and Fidelity. King Solomon was disposed to confer it only on a few persons of distinction. H., K. of T., not being a Jew, took but liftle interest in its preservation, while H. A., being more liberal in his views and feelings, expressed himself in favor of conferring it upon all who~ should be found worthy."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I 27 213 After mature deliberation, the three G. Ms. entered into a three - fold 0. in regard to the M. M.’s XVord. The points in this 0. were: 1. Not to confer it until the Temple was completed. 2. To confer it only on such as should be found worthy. 3. Not to confer it until the three were present and consented thereto. This last condition was added, lest in case one alone should be permitted to confer this Degree, fear, favor or partiality might influ - ence them to overlook the faults of favorites and admit unsuitable persons. Hence the discerning F. will readily discover that the M.’s Word was not designed for B * * purposes as the fifteen F. C. supposed it was, but to transmit to future generations the name of T. G. A. 0. T. 13.; for it was written in 2 Chron., 2d chap., that Solomon determined to build a house for the Name of the Lord. To accomplish so desirable an object, K. S ardently desired to perpetuate the S. W. and glorious science of F.; but being aware by the Oh. voluntarily assumed by the three G. Ms. that, should either of them die before the completion of the Temple, the M’s Word (now the 0. 0. XV. of a R. A. M.) would be forever lost, proposed to have it engraved upon a T ~‘ ~ plate of gold in the Syriac, Chaldaic and Egyptian tongues, which plate of gold should be dis - posed of as might afterwards be agreed upon. The construction of this plate of gold was assigxied to our G. M., H. A., who was filled witty wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all man - ner of works. After the melancholy event of his * * the two R. Ms. made strict search about the Temple for this plate of gold, but failing to recover it, expressed to A., the most intimate friend of H. A., their fears that the Word of a M. M. was lost, which they had taken the precaution to have engraved on a plate of gold by our G. M., H. A. This circumstance having been mentioned to A., the remembrance flashed across his mind of a conversation he had with H. A., previ - .ous to his death. He stated to the two R. Ms. that after the S. S. had been completed, and a portion of the H. V. deposited therein, ~ou a certain day near High Twelve he went there to deposit one of the H. V. When the Craft were called from labor to refreshment he did not retire with the rest, but lingered behind with H.A., whose cus - tom it was to enter the S. S. and offer up his devotions to the D., previous to his drawing his designs upon the Trestle Board. After the rest of the Craft had retired, A. asked H. A. when he should receive the Word 0 f a M. M. H. A. replied: When the Temple was completed, if found worthy he should receive it. N said: “ Suppose one of von three, even yourself~ should be removed by death prior to that event, how then shall I receive it? For you have informed me that it could only be communicated in the presence of S., K. of I., Hi., K. of T., and yourself.’’ H. N., after commenting on the subject of death, and standing, as he was over the S. V., and * ~ with his * upon the pavements replied. Before I ~ * it will be ~ there.’’ This conversation being related to our two surviving R. MIs.. ai~d they ~ 0 nsideriug the mysterious expression. ‘‘ Before I * * it will be ~ ~ there,’’ had some reference to the plate of gold upon which was inscribed the Word, they descended and entered the 5. V., and after diflgeflt search found the plate of gold laid upon the cover of the Ark of the Covenant, covered with the jewels of the three G. Ms. Thus they found it, and thus they left it, and there it r~nained until all the essentials of F. were brought to light by thc builders of the S. T., after they had lain concealed for 470 years, which will be more fully explained to you in the S. Ms. Degree. H. A. no longer lived to enjoy the fellowshiP of Ks. or to share in the labors of the Temple, wherefore the two surviving R. Ms., in token of respect to his memory, and being unable to form ~he T * * in giving the Word, as one of their number was dead, they substituted the broken T it being the nearest they could come to the original. They first conferred the Degree upon A., and then upon other par - ticular friends of 11. A. As his friends, we now confer it upon you. You see that the seat formerly occupied by the representative of our 0. M., IL A., is now vacant, his jewels are in mourning and the light extinguished. When you entered you probably noticed the Companions seated in positions of mourning and sadness. We then repr~sented our ancient brethren lamenting the loss of our much-loved G. lvii.

The furniture of the S. S. consisted of many H. V. made of pure gold, but the most important there was the Ark of the Covenant, called the Glory of I~rael, which was seated in the midst of the Most Holy Place under the wings of the Cherubims. It was a small chest or cofl~er, 2~ cubits long and 1’~ cubits wide and deep. It was made of shittim wood, excepting only the Mercy Seat, bat overlaid with gold both inside and out; it had a ledge of gold surrounding it on the top, into which the cover called the Mercy Seat was placed. The Mercy Seat was of solid gold, the thickness of a hand’s breadth. At the two ends of it were the two Cherubims looking toward each other, with their wings expanded which, embracing the whole circumference of the Mercy Seat, met on each side, in the middle. All the Rabbins say it was made out of the same mass, without any soldering of parts. Here the Shekinab, or Divine Presence, rested an(l was visible in the appearance of a cloud over it. From hence the “ BNTH KOL” issued and gave answers, when God was con - sulted. And hence it is that God is said in the Scriptures to dwell between the Cherabims on the Mercy Seat; because there was t.he Seat, or Throne, of the visible appearance of His Glory among them. T.

S., foreseeing that, in process of time, the Hebrews would forsake the true religion, that Jerusalem would be destroyed, Judea laid waste, and the nation car - ried inta captivity, constructed a S. V. for the preservation of the most precious treasures of the T., believing that, in future ages, the people, returning to the land of their fathers, would discover these memorials and recognize in them the sacred symbols of their ancient faith. This S. V. embraced nine AP, or ACHS, and extended from a place known as K. S.’s private room to a point beneath the S. S. The work of its construction was carried on during the period of the build - ing of the T., but only in the night from the hour of the second __ I"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"38 39 watch, or nine, until low twelve or midnight, and was accomplished by twenty seven S. M. including S. K. of I., H. K. of T. and H. A. The last, or ninth ACH communicated with the S. S. above, but prior to the completion of the T., that communication was closed by a curiously wrought KSTN having four equal sides which sloped slightly inward from the crown to the base. During the progress of the work in this S. V., the following incident occurred, which illus - trated the wisdom, justice and mercy of the three G. M. Zab., a favorite of K. S., having, on several occasions, been refused admission to his private room, feared that he had lost the favor of his sovereign, and, for a long time, grieved in silence. At length, unable longer to conceal his grief, he made it known to K. S., who said, “ Be content, my friend Zab., the time will soon come when the door will be left open for your reception.” This answer satisfied Zab. Soon after Zab. sought an interview with K. S., and seeing the door of his private room open, and not being hindered, as usual, by Ahi the G., lie concludod that tho door had been left open fur his reception, according to the promise of the K., and fearlessly entered. Not finding K. S., and observing an open passage at the further end of the room, lie cntered it in search of him. Here he was met by A., the C. of the G., who demanded the SN, TN and W, of his ENT. As Zab. was unable to give them, an alarm was made by A., which brought K. S. from his station in the N. A., to the ENT of the S. V. K. S., when informed that an intruder had enterd the S. V., ordered him to be put to death. Zab., however, was permitted to explain his conduct, when it appeared that his intrusion into the S. V. was due to an unguarded remark of K. S., as well as to the unworthiness of Ahi., the G., who was found asleep at his post. This explanation proving satisfactory to the three G. M., Zab. was pardoned, and admitted to the company of S. M., in the place of Ahi., who was eKecuted for having proved unworthy of the trust reposed in him. In the N. A., the three G. M. deposited copies of the AK of the CT, the BK of the LW. AN’s RD. the PT of MN and other sacred treasures. They also inscribed upon the CYR of the AK the NM of the DTY, over which they placed their SQRS. The DEP was made in the following manner: The records in the Book of the Fathers say: And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites which bore the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying, Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a wit - ness against thee. ~g I.

And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, fill an omer of it to he kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed von in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the laud of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up be - fore the Lord to he kept for your generations. As the Lord com’n~turlerl Moses, so Aitron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. T. I. 0. 31., D. 1. U. 11., P. (‘. of IF—Pot of manna de~ posit ed. Such is the LGD of the D. of S. M. From the LGD of the ID. of M. M. i~vI., you learned that a curi - ously wrought STN, remarkable for its singular form and beauty, was presanted to the OVRS of K. S. T. for inspections but, being neither oblong nor square and its purpose unknown to them, it was thrown among the rubbish, from whence it was subsequently recovered, having been identified as a KSTN made by HI. A. From the LGD of the R. A. ID., which relates to a period in JWHI and MSNC history nearly five centuries later than the events referred to in the D. of M. M. M., you learned that a similar STN was found to be the KS 1 T~ of a S. V., discovered by the Craftsmen engaged in the work of building the S. T. The LGD of the R. A. ID. also states that from this S. V. were brought the BK of the LW, the JWL of the ANC LDG and a PLT of GLD on which was engraved, in triangular form, the W., or NM of the DTY, in the SYR, CHA~LD and EGYP characters."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"40 In the LGD of the ID. of R. M., you were informed that, three years previous to the completion of the F. T., the G. C. of M. decided to communicate the W. to those Craftsmen who had distin - guished themselves by their industry, fidelity and skill, and that it was also agreed not to make known the W. until the T. was finished, and then only in the presence, and with the consent, of the three G. M. Also that, in order to preserve the W. for future ages, in the event of anything occurring, prior to the completion of the T., to prevent its communication to the CFT, H. A. engraved it on a PLT of GLD, in triangular form, in the SYR, CEJALD and EGYP characters, and this PLT was deposited in a S. V. lin(ler the S. S. You were also informed that, in consequence of the DTH of H. A., the S. U. M. could not communicate the W., and that a S. was given in its place. You are now in a place representing the N. A. of that S. V. In the H. A. ID., as representing a MSN of the S. T., you i7eached the N. A. through the opening made by the removal of the KSTN at its apex. In this ID. of S. M., as representing a MSN of the F. T., you have reached the N. A. from its proper entrance at the F. A. Thus here, in the N. A., you now find united the IVISNY of the F. T. and the MSNY of the S. T. This represents the KSTN of that S. V. (showing the KSTN), which you will recognize as the curiously wrought STN rejected by the overseers in the ID. of M. M. M. It is the same STN found in the H. A. ID., to be the KSTN of the S. V. discovered by the Craftsmen engaged in the work of building the S. T. (ACH is formed by two Camps. and KSTN let in). You were not informed in any of the degrees of A. C. MI., pre - ceding that of H. MI., when, why and by whom this S. V. was built, neither the form of its construction, nor when, why, and by whom the ~V. and other treasures were there deposited. To explain these secrets, and complete the unfinished work of the preceding degrees of A. C. MI., is the purpose of the ID. of R. and S. M. * * .i~. You have been informed that the U. 0. XV. was engraved on a PLT of ULD in the SYR, CHALD and EGYP characters. The I 0 4t HEB form of this \\V., Jah or You, was explained in the ID. of H. M. lilt now remains to explain the Chaldaic form Bel or BcLl, and the Egyptian form On. Among the Chaldeans, Ph(ienicians and other ancient nations, the Deity was designated by the name of Bel, Bctl or Baol, and which has been incorrectly rendered Bid. The proper word is El or Al, and the use of the letter B, as a preax to form Bel, Bal or Baa 1, is for the sake of euphony. El or Al is one of the most ancient names of the Deity, and from it comes the English word All.’’ with its deriva - tives, ‘‘ Hale,’’ meaning whole or healthy; ‘‘ Holy,’’ meaning whole or perfect, and Heal,’’ meaning to i~ake whole or to cure. The Deity is El, or Holy, and also Al, or the All in All. C Elo 1dm is the plural form of El, and implies a plurality of per - sons in the Divine Nature—the Triune—God. It is used many times in the account of the creation in the Book of Genesis. The ancient Hebrew Rabbis said: ‘‘ Come and see the mystery of the word Elohim. There are three degrees, and each (legree by itself alone, and yet. notwithstanding, they are all one anti joined together in one and are not divided from each other.” It is a tradition that Plo 1dm is the expression in phonetic char - acters of the form by which Adam communicated to his descendants his knowledge of the Deity, and that this was the name by which the Almighty was known to mankind until the days of Seth, after the birth of Enos, when, according to Genesis, 4th chapter and 26th verse, ‘‘ Men began to call upon the Name of Jehovah.’’ It is the opinion of the ancient Hebrew Rabbis that El or Elohini denotes the Almighty as a God of justice, and Jelioi’oli as a God of mercy The word On represents the Greek pronunciation of the Name of the Deity among the ancient Egyptians, and is the contracted form of Aum or Aom, the sacred letters of the Hindu Name of the Deity. Under the Name represehted by the word On, the ancient Egyptians worshiped the true God, but when they adored His symbol., the Sun, the Name of On was applied to that symbol and corrupted to Zon, and afterwards to Sun, The city of On, in Egypt, was also called Heliopolis, meaning the City of the Sun."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"42 From On is derived the Latin word Unu.g from which have come the English words Unity, Union, Only and One. * At V In the Septuagint, or Greek version of the Old Testament, the words, “ I am that I am,” are rendered ‘‘ I am the On” In the Hebrew text of the same verse, On is represented by the word EldynA, which is identical with Jehovah or Yahooah, the sacred Tetragrammaton and Ineffable Name of the Deity. In the Greek text of the Book of Revelations, 1st chapter and 4th verse, the Deity is named On, the English translation being, “ Him which is, which was, and which is to come.” The Deity is On, or the One and Only God. * * * Another form of the word, as applied to the Deity, is found in Amon, which is a compound of Aum and On. This form, Aum-on or Aoi-on, will be recognized, with a slight change, in the word A men which is generally used to conclude a prayer. Chronologically, the Degrees of R. and S. M. are the first ID. of A. C. M. They have been placed, however, as the last degrees, for the reason that the secrets they explain were not revealed to the CFT at large until the period of the building of the S. T., as related in the R. A. ID. To account for the S. V~, and the preservation of its contents before their discovery, made in the iR. A. ID., would be an improper disclosure, subverting the entire system of A. C. M. The Degrees of R. and S. M., being, therefore, the first as well as the last Degrees, are denominated the Alpha and Omega of A. C. MI. * x’ •x The traditions of F. M. may or may not be facts, and we use them simply to illustrate moral, philosophical andreligious truths. Traditions form the early history of all ancient nationr, and, in like manner, the unrecorded annals of F. M. reach far back into the dim and mysterious past. * V. 43 Its preservation through many centuries seems almost miraculous, when we reflect that so little has been saved from the storms of ages which have buried in solitude and desolation the great empires of antiquity. * The landmarks of F. MI., its symbolism, traditions, passwords, grips and signs bear the impress of ancient days. Excepting the Sacred Scriptures, authentic history embraces comparatively modern times and, beyond the point where it begins, we must accept tradition for the record of past events if we nocept anything. * 4? To the brief record of Hiram AbiW in the Sacred Scriptures, is added the history of his life and death compiled from the legends transmitted from the ancient MSN to their successors. We know that his father was a citizen of Tyre; that his mother was a Hebrew woman; and that he was sent by Hiram, King of Tyre, to aid in the work of building King Solomon’s Temple. We also know that lie was a skillful worliman, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that ho was the chief of that illustrious fraternity, called tho ‘‘ Dionysian Architects,’’ whose fame has survived the lapse of thirty centuries. Doubtless that fraternity received from King Solomon a form of organ - ization, peculiar to the workmen engaged in building the Temple, and which became the inheritance of the 0. MI. of the Middle Ages, from whom we, their successors, have received it. * All the symbolic working tools of the CFT teach, substantially, the same lessons, and, doubtless, have been fully explained to you. The Trowel, however, belongs peculiarly to the C I. Being used by 0. MI. to spread the cement which binds together the stones of a building, it symbolizes thc spirit of devotion and self-sacrifice which spreads the cement of brotherly love and affection, and unites us in the sacred bonds of companionship. 4? * Complete and contimfuous historical evidence should not be ex - pected regarding the origin and growth of our ancient Fraternity. But the true working tools of a S. MI. are th&forces at his dis - posal; the powers of mind and body loaned to him, as a sacred trust, by the Grand Architect of the Universe. They are to be used fo~"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"45 44 the ~nforeement of the lessons of duty. The lessons of duty are the lessons of life, embracing all the teachings of F. M. They teach us to sacrifice self; to control self; to give self to the service of human - ity; to raise the fallen; to strengthen the weak; to encourage the faint-hearted; supporting us with the Divine assurance that, in the -end, if we faint not, we shall overcome, and that he who overcomes shall eat of the Tree of Life which is in the Paradise of God. * * T.

This title of ‘‘ Companion “ represents a closer tie than that of ‘‘ Brother.’’ The relation of “ Brother’’ is shared by nIl MSNS, but that of “ Companion” results from choice and is con - fined to a few. All MSNS are our Brethren, but only the “ select” are our Companions. You have received the final and choicest Degrees of A. C. MI. In the deepest, highest, purest sense these Degrees are R. and S. The rights, honors, privileges’ and prerogatives of H. and S. Ms. are yours, ~and also their duties. You must assume the duties if you accept the honors. They cannot be divorced without violating, at least, an implied obligation. ‘Unless prevented by sickness. or some other una - voidable occurrence, it is your duty to attend the stated meetings of your Council, do your share of the work, and strive, in every proper way, to promote its interests.

V., with its Nine Arches, eight of which are in course of construction, and the Ninth is used for mysterious purposes by the thice Ill. G. Ms. You have now gained a regular admission to the Ninth Arch, and are entitled to all the mysteries of a S. MI. in Masonry. But before communicat - ing them, I will explain your position as a S. MI. Freemasonry may be said to occupy two stages or platforms, the first of which, from E. A. to MI. E. MI., may be termed Masonry of the First Temple, and the second, from Royal Arch and upwards, Masonry of the Second Temple. The Select Masters of the First Temple, except only the three Ill. G. Ms., were excluded from the Ninth Arch, and the confines of that royal apartment, constituted the dividing line between the S. M. of the First Temple and those of the Second. As a H. A. MI. you found an irregular and difficult passageway to the Ninth Arch through the apex of the same. As a Select Master of the First Temple, you traversed the S. V. from the entrance to the Altar; but as a S. MI. of the Second Temple, you entered the Ninth Arch by the doorway, and are now, so to speak, standing upon 1)0th platforms. Our Ill. G. MIs., S. K. of I., H., K. of T., and II. A , while they were building the masonry of the First Temple, were also in the Ninth Arch, laying the Voundation for the Masonry of the Second Temple, and they properly belong to both. We, as their Companions and successors, having regularly entered the Ninth Arch by the doorway, are taking a position in advance of R. X. MI. These remarks will explain to you why this Degree, which"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"47 46 I is 470 years older than the R. A. Degree, should become an. after matter, in the order of progression. The Degree of S. M. is the summit of A. C. M. It is the 0., the last Degree. Here will be unfolded all the mysteries which envelop the preceding Degrees. Here the circumstances which led to the organization of the Council will be explained. Here IM. will triumph over J. In the preceding Degree of R. MI., and preparatory only to that of S. M.,.you were informed that our three G. Ms., at the building of the Temple, entered into a solemn obligation before the altar of Masonry, that the 0. ‘\\V. should not be given except when all three ~vere present, and only to such M. Ms. as should prove themselves worthy by their integrity, zeal and fidelity, and their skill in archi - tecture. These were the essentials which would be required of every candidate for the highest Masonic honor. When the Temple at Jerusalem was drawing toward completion, it appears that our G. M., K. S., had some premonitions that the beau- - tiful edifice which was nearly completed would sooner or later be destroyed, and the Children of Israel scattered abroad. Being naturally desirous of transmitting to future generations a knowledge of the only true and living God, and also of Geometry and Masonry, he cast about him for som.~e means to accomplish this end. Our three G. Ms. resolved, when in G. Council assembled, to build a S. V. underground leading from K. S.’s most retired apart - ment due Southwesterly and ending under the S. S. This V. was to be divided into nine separate arches. They determined that within the dark and deep recesses of the Ninth Arch the G. Council should hold its deliberations, while within it should be deposited a true copy of all those things which were con - tained in the S. S. above. To aid them in this glorious work they selected A., the Captain of the Guard, twenty-two stone squarers from the city of Gebal, who were well skilled in the arts and sciences with A., the Sentinel, making with our three G. Ms. twenty-seven in all, or three in each of the nine arches. The hours of labor were from nine at night until low twelve, when all prying eyes were closed in sleep. While this secret work was being prepared, a circumstance trans - pired which not only characterizes this Degree but exemplifies the justice and mercy which governed our Ill. G. MI. Z. ~va~ K. S.’s Prime Minister, his friend, his chief favorite and ‘his confidant. He accidentally discovered that a secret work was going on about the Temple, of which he had not been infornied by K. S. For days he grieved in silence. At length he communicated his suspicions to K. S., and reproached him for his lack of confidence in not permitting him to participate in the undertaking. K. S. assured him that his confidence remained undiinitii~hed, and that the day would arrive when a door would be left open for his reception. This for a season satisfied him; bat Masonic tradition informs us that Z., having particular business with K. S., sought him as usual in his most retired chamber, but could not find him. It was then that he discovered the door of the S. V. open, and not guarded as it usually was by A. He took it for granted that agreeably to the promise of El. 5., it was left open for his reception, and boldly entered. He was immediately accosted by A.,the Captain of the Guard, who demanded, ‘‘ Who comes here ?‘‘ Z. replied, ‘‘A zealous Brother who wishes to participate with you in your labors.” A then demanded the W. and S. Z. replied that lie had none A. then cried out, “ An ~ “‘ and the cry was heard from evcry workman in the S. ‘V. : “ Put him to In the midst of this confusion, K. S. ~vent to the entrance of the ~. V., and demanded the cause of the alarm A informed him that an had entered the S. ‘V. K. S. ordered that he be put 1 mmediately. A. was about to the order of the K., when it was discovered that it was the K.’s friend, and the Marshal addressed him thus: ‘‘ T. I. G. M., consider for a moment upon whom you are about to inflict this awful ; this is none other than your particular friend, Z.,’ El. S. replied: Bind him fast and let him be forthcoming when called for, or your life shall answer for his escape.’’ K. S. then returned to the Ninth Arch, where the three G. Ms. consulted together. ‘Upon examinatiOn they find that only twenty- seven can be employed in the work, three on each Arch; it was therefore beyond the power 0 f the K. to pardon his friend. They all returned to the entrance of the S. V., and ordered the. ~ brought before them. K.

M., you may well remember how great has been my zeal for your sacred person and these your solemn mysteries. I was at all times the happy sharer of your favors, and the first to be entrusted with your R S. ; bat of late finding a secret work going on in which I was deemed unworthy to participate, 1 for a time grieved in silence. I thought I had lost the confidence of my Sovereign. At length I took the liberty of complaining to you, and received for answer, ‘ Be content, Z., the time will come when a door will be opened for you.’ This for a time satisfied me. This evening, having some particular business with ‘your Majesty, I came to your most retired chamber in search of you, and finding the door of the S. V. open, and A. the Guard not hindering me as usual, I took it for granted that it was left open for my reception and entered. Far .be it from me that either curiosity or disobedience prompted me to do so.” H., K. of T., addressed K. S. thus: I find that your friend is not guilty of the charge alleged against him; it is owing to some unguarded expression of your own; he must therefore be pardoned and admitted.” K. S. replied: “ Why, how can that be; are not our numbers already com - plete ?“ H. A. then said: Thrice Ill. G. M., our numbers are already complete; but A., the G., is no longer worthy of our confidence, he is sleeping at his post. Ho alone is guilty; let him therefore be discharged and * * and Z. placed in his stead.” My Companion, the scenes through which you have passed this evening are a representation of what took place at that time in the S. V. and bear this great and important teaching; that the most stern and inflexible justice can, at all times, by prudent and wise counsel~ be tempered with mercy. After the Ninth Arch was completed, the three G. Ms. deposited therein a true copy of all those things contained in the S. S. above, ~vhich were of importance to the Craft and ,Jewish Nation; such as the Ark ‘of the Covenajit, the Book of the Law, Aaron’s Rod, and the Pot of Manna. We will now explain to you the manner in which the deposit was made. The Records in the Book of Fathers say. And it camo to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this L~w in a book, until they ~vere finished. That Moses c.mmanded the Levites, which bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying: Take this Book of the Law, and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. ~DeuteronOmY ~ 24—26.

And Moses said unto Aaron, take a Pot, and put an omer full of Manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generatiOns.

Mx CO~IPAN ION: The S. E. NI.’s De~ree is intended to illustrate that portion of Jewish history relating to the invasion of Judea, the destruction of Jerusalem, its magnificent Temple and palaces, and the cargying away captive of Zedekiah and a large host of his subjects to Babylon- The place in which the S. E. M. originally met was the Sane. The hour of meeting, that of the second watch"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"60 61 The ceremonies through which you have passed are a representa - tion of what transpired at their la~t assembly. The time of the second watch having arrived, in the absence of the King, Gedeliab, the first officer of the household, took his station and proceeded to open the Council. But before he could proceed to the transaction of business, a Herald arrived, bringing intelligence that N., King of Babylon, approached with innumerable forces and filled the city; that the enemy was formidable and victorious, approaching the King’s Palace, and within a few furlongs of the Temple, and everywhere was unhallowed carnage’ and devastation. The King. then entered the Council Chamber and took his station in the East. Gedeliah returned to the West, informed the King that the Council was opened, the officers stationed and awaited his orders. The King confirmed the opening of the Council, and inquired what report brought the Herald. Gedeliah having reported the announcement, the King asked, Was there any business to be brought before the Council? ‘The Recorder answered there was none except the Candidate in waiting to receive the 0 ~ ~ of S. E. M. Bat before the King could proceed to confer it, the Council was disturbed by the arrival of another Herald, who reported that the enemy had assaulted the Temple with battering rams, and the courts were filled with carnage. The King seeing his danger became terri~’led, and no doubt, conscience stricken; for when N. placed him on the Throne of Israel, he entered into a solemn compact to remain a faithful ally; but no sooner did the King of Egypt propose that they should join their armies, give battle to the King of Babylon, and thus attempt to throw off the yoke, than he consented, thus openly violating his ob. N., learning of the same, gathered together his army and by forced marches met the King of Egypt, gave him battle and drove him out of Syria, thus turning his full force towards Jerusalem, entered the land of Judea, invested the doomed city, and, aft~r a long siege of more than twelve months, was admitted by a traitor; and then commenced the indiscriminate destruction of the city just reported. The King anxiously inquired, Was there no way to escape? Gedeliah answered there was none, except by way of the gate, between the two walls, which is by the King’s garden (2 Kings, xxv. 4—10), leading out to the Plains of Jericho. By this way the King made his escape. The enemy failing to find the King discovered his flight, followed after him, and overtook him on the Plains of Jericho; took him prisoner and led him up to Riblab. R’iblah was a town situated’On the northeastern boundary of Pales - tine, on the direct road from Babylon to Jerusalem, and was at this time the headquarters of the invading army. Here they passed judg - ment upon him, slew his sons and principal officers before his face; put o ~ ~-i~ theKing’s e * ~ ,cut off hist * * ,boundhim in fetters of hr ~ ~ and led him captive to Babylon; carrying with them a large host of his subjects. This was the beginning of the Seventy Years’ Captivity, during which time the Jews would often meet in groups on the banks of the river Euphrates, bemoan their sad condition, and long for the time when they should return to their own land, anti rebuild thcir city and Temple. This they were permitted to do, as you learned in the R. A. Degree, after the issuing of that celebrated Edict of Cyrus, King of Persia. Bttt, my Companion, the illustration of historical fact is not the only object intended by this Degree, but rather to add to and confirm the lessons already learned in your preceding Degrees. Here you have promised to pay adoration to no B., e~ccept that S. B., a faith in whose existence is the foundation of F. It also teaches the importance of keeping our obligations invio - late, by holding up to our view the awful conse 4 uences which followed the traitorous acts of the last K. of I. II trust that these lessons will ever exert the proper influence upon your mind, so that when you have passed your earthly captivity here, you may, by the edict of the G. A. of the U., be permitted to enter the New Jerusalei~n, and dwell in that Grand Temple, not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. S. W. and explanatiOns"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"433 I A’ 62 OR THIS LECTURE. In the Ch. the D. of M. E. M. commemorates the dedication of K. S. T. The next D. of H. R. A. commemorates the return of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, and the building of the Second Temple. Between. these great events, comnu morated in these two D., is a period of 470 years, of which NISNCY you know nothing. This D. of S. E. M. embraces this period of 470 years in Jewish and MSNC history, and unites the D. of M. E. M. with that of the H. R. A. K. S. died at the age of sixty years, twenty-nine years after the completiqn of the T., having reigned forty years, and his son Reho - boam succeeded him in the kingdom. The people, generally, were disposed to submit to Rehoboain, but, in consequence of his tyrannical conduct, a division of the tribes took place. Ten of the tribes formed the kingdom of Israel, under Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, while the remaining two tribes of Judab and Benjamin continued faithful to Rehoboam, and formed the king- (loin of Judab. rrhe kingdom of Israel existed 2~4 years, when it was destroyed by Shalmaneser, King of Assyria, who carried the people into cap - ti vity. Shalmaneser repeopled the ~nnd with settlers from his own coun - try, who, afterwards, were called Samaritans. With their heathen worship they mixed portions of the Jewish religion, but the Jews regarded them as strangers and foreigners, who had taken unjust possession of the land, and refused to have any dealings with them. K. S. T. stood in all its glory for thirty-three years after its dedica - tion. But in the fifth year o~ King Rehoboam’s reign, Shishak, King of Egypt, invaded Judea, captured Jerusalem and despoiled the Temple. For the first time in its history the Temple was subjected to dese - cration. After this it suffered several profanations. When the people forsook the religion of their fathers, God punished them with the sword, famine, pestilence and captivity. But when they repented of their sins and returned to the Lord their God, he delivcred them from their enemies and restored them to peace and prosperity. Eventually the Jews became so idolatrous and degenerate that God sent Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, to punish them for their sins. He invaded •Judea with a great army, captured ,Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and carried away to Babylon many captives, including the King and his family, the princes, the mighty men of yalor and the craftsmen. Only the poorest of the people were left in the land to till the soil. INebuchadnezzar placed on the throne Mattaniah, the uncle of the deposed King. He made Mattaniah swear to be true and faithful to him, and to engage him the more to be so, he changed his name to Zedekiab, which signifies the ju.stiee of Jehornh, intending, by this name, to put him continually in mind of the vengeance which he might expect from the just ice of Jehovah, if he violated that fidelity which, in the name of Jehovah, he had e~worn to maintain. But Zedekiah broke his obligatiOn, and, in the ninth year of his reign, rebelled against the King of Babylon. When Nebuchadnezzar heard of Zedekiah’ s rebellion he raised a mightier army than before, and ordered Nebuzaradan, the captain of the host, to invade Judea and destroy Jerusalem and the Temple. At this point in the Jewish history the drama of this D. begins. Gedaliah, the commanderinchief of tl~e Jewish army, is in the Tem - pIe, with some of the people, but the King is absent. A great calamity is impending. A mighty army is marehii’ig against Jerusalem. Outposts are stationed around the city to give notice of the approach of the enemy. The trumpet sounds and the Herald announces the advance of a vast army. PreparatiOns are made to defend the Temple. The trumpet sounds again, and the Herald announces that the enemy has surrounded the city, has broken down the walls, entered the streets, and that death, carnage and devastation reign everywhere. The King now enters the Temple, and learns from Gedaliah that the enemy is victorious. The trumpet sounds again, and the [lerald announces that the enemy is assaulting the gates of the Temple with battering rams, and all is lost. The King asks Gedaliah if there is no way of escape and, being told of a secret way leading to the plains of Jericho, he flies with his guards, leaving the Teihple and his people to their fate. But he did not escape, for we are told in Scripture: “ The King, with all his men of war, fled by night, by the way of’ the gate, be - tween the walls, which is by the King’s gardens and the King went the way towards the plain, and the army of the Chaldeans pursued"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"64 65 after the King, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him, so they took the King and brought him up to the King of Babylon, to Riblah, and they gave judgment upon him, and they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and they put out the eyes of Zedekiab, and bound him with fetters of brass and cifrried him to Babylon.” Thus were fulfilled the predictions of the prophets, that Zede - kiah, King of Judah, would be carried to Babylon, yet his eyes were not to see it, though he should die there. When Gedaliah found that the Kind had fled with his guards, that the young men were slain, and the old men and maidens were captives, he repaired with his companions to the altar to offer up prayers and supplications to God. When placed at the altar to take the OB you represented Gedaliah and his companions. While they were at the altar the Temple was stormed, and, as the enemy entered the sanctuary, the Jews cried out, ‘‘ The enemy is upon us; defend the Temple.” Then followed a fierce conflict, in which the Jews were overcome by superior numbers. Some of the Jews took hold of the horns of the altar for safety. They were about to be slain by the enemy, when some one interfered and proposed to carry them into captivity, and make them hewers of wood and drawers of water. This scene You were In this On your return to the room the Companions represented to you the mourning and distress of the Jews, during their captivity of seventy years, as they sat by the rivers of Babylon and sang the mournful songs of Zion. Nebuzaradan, having utterly destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple and brought all to a thorough and perfect desol~tion, withdrew his forces, after appointing Gedaliah to be governor~over the remnant of the people left in the land. Soon afterwards Gedaliah was ussassi - nated by Ishmael, the son of Nathaniah, when most of the people emigrated to Egypt. Nebuzaradan again invaded Judea to avenge the murder of Gedaliah, and carried away the remains of the people, numbering only 745 persons, so that not a single inhabitant was left in the land. The land remained uninhabited until the return of the Jews under the decree of Cyrus. Near the end of the period of seventy years from the first capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and the first carrying away of the Jews, Darius, King of Media, with his nephew, Cyrus, King of Per - sia, overthrew the Babylonish empire, capturing the city of Babylon, and slaying the King Belshazzar who, at a banquet with his lords, was profaning the holy vessels taken from the Temple. Two years after this event Darius died and was succeeded by Cyrus, who became King of Media and Babylon, as well as of Persia. Cyrus then issued his famous decree permitting the Je~vs to return to the land of their fathers and rebuild the city and temple of their God. The number of those who returned to Jerusalem was 42,360, with their servants, amounting to 7337 more. Their leaders were Zerubbabel, the grandson of Jehoiachin, King of’ Judah, and Jeshua, the High Priest. They received many gifts from the Persians and Babylonians, and Cyrus gave them large sums of money, besides returning the gold and silver vessels which Nebu - chadnezzar had taken from the Temple, amounting to 5400 in number. On arriving at Jerusalem, they erected an altar and offered sacrifices to God, but it was not until the second year of their return that they began the great work of rebuilding the Temple. The Jews were greatly impeded in this work by their enemies, the Samaritans, and not until the seventh year of Darius, King of Persia, the suc - cessor of Cyrus, was the Temple finished and dedicated, being nearly twenty years after the laying of the foundation. The captivity of seventy years dates from the fourth year of Jehoiachin, when Nebuchadnezzar first invaded Judea, and ends in the fIrst year of Cyrus, when the work of restoration began. It will also interest you to know that from the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple by Nebuchadnezzar, until the publishing of the decree of Cyrus at Jerusalem, in the fourth year of Darius, is a period of exactly seventy years. Also, that from the complete deso -"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"66 lation of Judea, when Nebuzaradan carried away the remnant of the people, until the dedication of the Second Temple, in the seventh year of Darius, is a similar period of seventy years. Many among the ten tribes returned to Jerusalem with the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and the people thus blended together took the name of Jews from Judah, which tribe had the leadership, being more numerous than the others. The Jews never again showed any inclination to fall into idola - try. After the Babyloni~h captivity, the Chaldaic became the language of the Jews, the ancient Hebrew being no longer spoken. Having thus explained, as briefly as possible, the leading events in the Jewish history, from the dedication of the first Temple until the return of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, I have united the degree of M.
