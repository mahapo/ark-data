In the year 1772 a G~rand Lodge was constituted, and a Warrant is in the possession of the Supreme Grand Commander of the Order, together with other documents relating to this and the Excellent Masters’ Degrees, with which degree it has always been allied. This Warrant or Charter, sanctioned by the Grand Lodges of England under the Old Constitu - tions before the Union in 1813, is dated November, 1793, and it informs us that H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence had been pleased to accept the Grand Command of the Order, and it is signed by several distinguished Masons of the period.—Their Royal Highnesses the Dukes’ of Sussex and Kent were members of the Order.—This Grand Lodge was in existence down to the year 1670, and the 32"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"‘4 THE ROYAL ARK MARINERS’ DEGREE.

Morton Edwards as his Pro. - Grand Commander, with full authority to act and con - vene mectings of Royal Ark Mariners, reorganising a Grand Lodge,” &c., &c. It also goes on to say that “the position the degree of Royal Ark Mariner has always held in Scotland is this, that it is never given to any Bro. who is not a Royal Arch Mason. It is worked extensively over the whole continent of America, very much in India, and in many of the Colonies and Dependencies of the British Empire.” We also learn that it has been worked in London from long previous to 1772, and that the Royal .Ark Mariners claim by immemorial custom to have the .Tight to work the Degrees of Mark Man and Mark Master, and that the Grand Lodge of Mark Masters also claim to bave the power to work the Royal Ark Mariners Degrees. It was therefore arranged in 1870 that in order that th~ Grand Master and Officers of the Mark Degree should have an opportunity of judging as to the merits of this Degree, that there should be a meeting held without pre - judice to the claims of either, and it was hoped that either party would disclaim ite intention to work the other Degrees, or that an arrangement for union or attachment ~d the Royal Ark Mariner to the Mark Degree much in The same ir anner as the Royal Arch to the Craft, would become to.

He may not have a meal to eat or proper cloth-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"14 THE ROYAL ARK MARINERS’ DEGREE. ing to put on. If this be the case the Brother to whom it may be made known will do well to relieve this distress, remembering that it is more blessed to give than to re - ceive, and who so seeth his Bro. have need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him, for he that saith he loved God and loveth not his Bro. is a liar and the truth is not in him, therefore as wise students of the manifold gifLa of God, we should always have a hand and heart ready to help a distressed Brother. Thirdly, A Brother’s distress may arise from his being situated among his enemies, so as to render it necessary to call in the assistance of a Bro. as to his bodily strength, if this be the case, the Bro. who perceives the hailing sign will immediately come to his aid, and such will be his love for his Brother, if he believes him to be worthy, that he will sooner die by his side than desert him. This Mark is always placed in a Royal Ark Mariner’s summons of importance, with such a mark you must attend if possible, but if by unavoidable circumstances you cannot do so, you must send your reasons in writing, with the same mark, which means the Brother or Lodge receiving it, must take the will for the deed, and the Bro. will have done his duty.

By wisdom and the cunning wor]~anship he was possessed of, that beautiful structure the Ark was formed, the strength of which proved the temporal salvation of himself and his family, and all the living creatures contained therein. We consider that these tools have other meanings, which I will explain to you. The axe fells trees, and they being cut down are an emblem of the fall of the Old World, and as the axe fells and squares the timber so it points out the good providence of God in choosing Noah and his family for his designs, and as the saw divides these trees into planks so it declares how the Lord separated Noah’s family from the rest of mankind. As the Borer makes holes in the planks, so it teaches us the use of a~ictions to make holes and uneasiness in our minds, that the axe of God’s goodness may cut out promises as pins, and drive them into our remembrance so as to keep us in one family dependent on Him, and as the Ark was built by these tools, so it shows us that by perseverance in Faith, Hope, and Love, we shall be shut into an Ark of safety, when the whole Earth shall be dissolved by liquid fire and the elements melt with fervent heat. The steps which you took were to fix in your mind the form of a Lodge, and the reason you were stopped at the three points was to remind you that Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty were dis - played in the construction of the Ark, they having also the moral signification then explained to you.

The Nine un-equiformed steps belonging to this Degree denote the nine signs timely given by the S. G. C. U. to our Grandfather Noah, to warn him that the time was drawing near for building the Ark, that he, his family, and the chosen of brute creation might escape from the overwhelming waters which destroyed all other living things upon the surface of the earth. The Triangular Pedestal represents Noah and his two sons, Japhet and Shem (Ham having been expelled with the curse which fell on his posterity). For about 800 years afterwards the Israelites,~ descendants of Shem, took possession of the Land of Canaan, destroyed most of its inhabitants, and laid heavy tribute on the remainder, whom afterwards the Greeks and Romans (descendants of Japhet) brought into subjection, so that Ham and his posterity became slaves to that of their Brethren, Japhet and Shem. The part of the Earth which Ham possessed was the South. Japhet the North and West, for we are to recollect the blessing upon Japhet is, that his territories should be enlarged, and accordingly his posterity spread themselves, not only. over Europe and Lesser Asia, but Media, Armenia, Theria, Albania, and those large regions towards the North, now inhabited by the Tartars. The posterity of Shem taking possession of the East.

THE Gi~x~ reminds us that however fast hold we may think to have of a Bro.’s hand, death may come between, loosen the grasp, and force each to give the slip. But after that a rallying point is found, where Brother shall cling to Brother, never to be separated any more, and even the grasping of the Index, and pointing both conjointly towards Heaven, will show you how the Grip of this Degree is to be rightly interpreted without my adding any - thing further.

BATTERY. —:0:— N. B.—When there are no Candidates for Elevation;.. the following lecture may be given by a Past Noah. P. N.—By reason of the sinful, nature of the whole earth, with the exception of Noah. and his family, God commanded that he should build an Ark. This structure was a range of building 800 cubits in length and. 80 cubits in height. It was built of Gopher wood, that being sup - posed to be what we call Cypress, and. whiclino worm or corroding animacuJ.~ will touch. It was pitched within and without, with pitch. to secure it from.the weather, it had one door in the centr~ of the sids, twelve oubits high and ten wide, and. one ~window only, which was placed in the centre of the roof. It was of three stories, capable of containing a prodigious quantity, being larger than forty ships of 1000 tons each, and ~was 120 years in buildino’. Some have doubted whether th.~ Ark was ‘capable of con-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"22 THE ROYAL ARK MARINERS’ DEGREE. taming two of every sort of creature, with provision 5 necessary for their support for a whole year, for so long and more did Noah stop in the Ark. But on a careful enquiry it has been found that only about 100 different sort of beasts, and not 200 birds, are known, the greater part of them, are of no great bulk, and many exceedingly small, and it has been said all the creatures in the Ark would not take up the room of 500 horses. After 4000 years human ingenuity cannot now contrive any propor - tions better adapted than that of the Ark for the purpose it was intended for. A Dutch merchant, 200 years ago, built a ship answering in its respective dimensions to those of the Ark, its length being 120 feet, breadth 20 feet, depth 12 feet; while building, this vessel was laughed at, but afterwards it was found that it held * more, and sailed better than any other merchant vessel of the time. Thus we have a collateral proof no way inconsiderable that the Spirit of God, from whom cometh all understand - ing, directed Noah in that manner. We find the reasons assigned in God’s counsels for the preservation of men and animals in the Ark, were, to keep seed alive upon the face of the earth. God could have preserved Noah from the wrath that was to come by taldng him to himself as he did Enoch. He could, after having destroyed every species of animal, with his word only have created an entirely new race upon the face of the earth, but this was not consis - tent with the purposes of His wisdom. The Great Apos - tate Spirit would undoubtedly have triumphed to have seen even one order of God’s creatures blotted out from the face of creation by his malicious attempts. All orders of beings would have trembled to have seen him prevail in any one instance. If even the meanest of God’s works had been destroyed by any means of hi~ he would have"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL ARK MARINERS’ DEGREE. 23 gained the poii~t he aimed at. It is therefore that the power and wisdom of God has been ever since employed, instead of destroying, in producing back things not only to their first perfection but to a still higher degree. God’s ways are far above our ways, wisdom is the first principle of all His actions. We may look upon the destroying of the whole world as a most terrible and severe judgment, and it should be a warning to us not to commit sin. Yet we think not of God as He is, if we suppose that He brought all this destruction for revenge like a provoked human being. No! it was His Wisdom and His Good- ness that produced it.—For mankind having grown urn - versally corrupt to a very exti~izi~idinary degree, it was the highest act of wisdom and goodness to succeeding genera - tions to take them away from the Earth, that the genera - tions to come might proceed from a good stock, for we find in general that the branches will partake of the nature from which they spring, and accordingly through this means, and otherwise alterations, the world in general has never been again so universally wicked and impious. It is supposed that a far greater number of souls were destroyed by the Deluge than are in existence at the pre - sent time. Thus was the race of sinners swept from the face of the earth, a terrible example to all succeeding ages. All their powers, their mighty strength, availed them nothing. When God arose to judgment all their pride was blasted, and they were scattered like stubble. With what horror did they see the increasing waters rise around to overwhelm them without any place to fly to. How did those who lived where Noah did, wonder at the strange - ness of his salvation, so far beyond all they looked for. How, repenting and groaning through anguish of spirit, did they look upon themselves. This is he whom we had"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"24 THE ROYAL ARK MARINERS’ DEGREE. sometimes in deri~ion, and a proverb of reproach. We fools accounted his life madness. How is it he is now in safety. Thus also, my Brethren, by the mercy and good providence of God, the Ark rested and Noah once more settled on earth, with a promise that man should no more be destroyed by water. When the families waxed nume - rous Noah divided them as he was appointed, as you have heard, but Ham, for his iniquity, was expelled to Africa, with his curse and mark upon him. Shem had the privilege of continuing in Asia, and Japhet, with his bless - ing, was sent to Europe, whilst Noah abided in the city which he built at the foot of 7.~Iount Ararat. The Officers of the Grand and Royal Ark Lodge being thus dispersed, warrant was given to them that wherever they settled they were to act as Grand Commanders, and convene Royal Ark Lodges under them, with full powers and instructions in all degrees of Ark Masonry. Thus dispersed Royal Ark Masonry began to flourish all over the earth, has descended to the present era, and so may it continue until time 8hall be no more.

Now, God commanded Noah to make an Ark of Gopher, instructing him how to fashion it, denoting the length, breadth, and height thereof, with first, second, and third stories, door and window. Noah took 100 years to complete it, he was 500 years old when he commenced it, and consequently was 600 when it was finished. He entered into it with his wife, three sons, their wives, and two and two of all flesh wherein was the breath of life. His father Lamech having died a short time before at the age of 777, there were no ancient patriarchs at the time of the flood with the exception of Methuselah, who attained the age of 969, and no mention is made in Holy Writ of his death, he is supposed to have perished in the flood which took place in the year of the world 1856, and destroyed most of the monuments of antiquity. Enoch, the son of Jared, sixth son in descent from Adam, had been instucted in the History of Man since the creation, also in the liberal Arts and Sciences, with which we may be certain the ~rst inhabitants of this world were well acquainted, perceiving that this know - ledge was likely to be lost in the general destruction foretold by Adam, and being desirotis of preserving the principles of the sciences for the posterity of those whom God should be pleased to spare; made two pillars, one of brass and the other of marble, with hieroglyphics on each. The brass pillar having been placed securely in a cavern, was not discovered for a very long period after - wards, as we hear from tradition, when the hieroglyphics upon it signifying that it was the depository of the liberal Arts, and of the history of the world to his period, were written for the first time and handed down.

So mote it be. ORATION O~ THE PRINCIPLES OF THE INSTITUTION. In early ages necessity taught the use of Society, and by the rapid progress made in Art and Sciences they were led to mark and contemplate the nature and properties of lines, figures, superficies, and solids, and thus by degreeS formed the sciences of Geometry and Architecture, sciences which have proved to be of the greatest utility in preserving the human race and anima,l creation on the face of the earth. These arts being cceval with the rest of the sciences were carefully handed down by Methuselah, who lived 255 years with Adam, by whom he was in - structed in all the mysteries, of these sublime sciences, and faithfully communicated them to his grandson Noah. After the flood the .possessors of the arts, according to antient tradition, were ftrst distinguished by the name of 1’Toac1iid~, or sons of Noah, afterwards sages or wise men, who had understanding in their time and knew what ought to be done, such were those who were instructed by Moses in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and Chaldeans —for this kind of learning was a tribe set apart, the children of Issacher, who were “Masters in Israel.” These in more modem times were called Philosophers,. and were venerated as sacred persons of the brightest parts and genius; such men as, these in all ages have been looked upon by the judicious as the greatest blessing to the communities where they dwelt, and the Art they were in possession of esteemed “Royal,” as practised by Kings and Princes. Noah, finding The superiority of Geometry and Architec - ____ ___________________________________________________________________________________________"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL ARE MARINERS’ DEGREE. 38 ture over the rest of the Sciences, sent Shem to Asia and Japhet to Europe, while he continued in the City he built at the foot of Mount Ararat, and convened Lodges under them, with full powers and instructions in all the degrees of Masonry. The officers of the first Royal Ark Lodge having expelled Ham to A.frica, who carried his curse and mark with him, at this time considered how a permanent Ark Lodge ought to be established, when immediately were presented to their view brotherly love, and unimpeach - able fidelity, as the most proper basis for so glorious an institution, whose aim it was to establish unity among its members. They no sooner set to work than the Grand Commander of the Universe instantly inspired men of similar opinions and manners to unite, while secrecy, prudence, morality, and every social and religious duty was cultivated amongst them. Thus, while they attended on Geometry and Architecture on one side, and the precepts of Wisdom and Ethics on the other, every wish and tem - poral blessing has attended the fraternity, and in this manner it has been providentially preserved to the present era. It is true that Ark Masonry, like every other part of the sublime science, has met with calimany and slander, easier hit off than praise, but unmoved by envy or by lucre, the champions of Royal Ark Masonry still pre - serve in keeping their laudable institution, and live in an affection and friendship with each other, rarely to be met with even amongst those whom the ties of consanguinity ought to bind in the strongest manner. (The following address may be left out at pleasure.) ADDRESS. [This particular intercourse, by uniting under the en~ dearing name of Brother, a name given not as an idle compliment or as a mere parade of words, but in a D"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"84 THE ROYAL ARK MARINERS’ DEGREE. manner which holds out the most intimate union, and diffuses a pleasure which no other institution can boast of, having in its possession all the valuable requisites of a true Brotherhood. It is in an Ark Lodge that merit and ability secure to their possessors honourable regard and respectable distinction. This every one receives with un - affected complacency and delight. Each exerts himself for the general good without vanity and without fear. No one contends for superiority, emulation is only with a view to please. The man of shining abilities and those unblessed with such ornaments are equally admitted, all may perform their parts suitable to the distinguishing test, and a social familiarity runs thi’ough the whole. Their pleasures are never embittered by ungrateful re - flexions, but produce a serene and lasting composure of mind, their conversation being such during their assem - blies as is conducted with perfect decency, for they hold an universal maxim—that in all their meetings they are never to speak of an absent Brother but with respect, consequently ifi-nature is excluded and all satire is for - bidden, by which rules decency never runs any risk, and in the most mirthful times the conversation of a Royal Ark Mariner may be said to be only wisdom in good humour, for although a Brother may mistake as a man (for no one is perfect) yet he has time, courage, and opportunity to recover himself. Thus, Brethren, has the antiquity of our excellent institution, the universality of its plan with the moral rectitude and purity of its design claimed a decided pre - eminence over every bond of union, and may the noble - ness of soul which first suggested its institution and the benevolence of heart, which has ever prevailed amongst its members, prompt and inspire you with the same virtues, so that under the auspices of thQ Grand Corn-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL ARK 3LARfl~ERS DEGREE. mander of the LTniverse you may flourish and prosper,.. remaining the subjects of lasting admiration.] P. 0.—I now call on the Grand Scribe to read the Petition and the Charter, which has been granted by the Grand Lodge, authorising the Royal Ark Mariners named therein to form and hold a Lod~e of the Fraternity.

The history of this degree is still involved in doubt as to its origin. The late Dr. Oliver says that anciently it was a degree leading to the Master Mason’s chair. An American writer says “it has been claimed as forming formerly a part of the second degree, as the Royal Arch was of the third, it is perfectly certain that none of the ceremonies now used in this degree belonged to the Fellow Craft Degree at the revival in 1817.” “How” says “that in England the Mark Degree is al - together a distinct institution, the only qualification being, hat the candidate should be a duly certified Master Mason. In Scotland considerable impqrtance is attached to the Mark Master in connexion with the Royal Arch.” This is also the case in America, where it is placed as the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"44 THE MARK MASTERS DEGREE. Fourth in the Primary or the Capitular Degrees. There is a close connexion between the second and fourth degrees, inasmuch as the first named shows the necessary duties of life, the last insists on the necessity of performing them with systematic regularity. A notable event in the history of this degree occurred on the 2nd of October, 1872, when the Mark Masons of Scotland and England were formally united. This im - portant event took place at the Freeniasons’ Hall, Cooper Street, Manchester, and it took years of patient toil to bring this fusion about. It is difficult to overra:e the importance of this event. The Provincial Grand Master of Lancashire, Bro. Romaine Callander, has, by virtue of his position, substantial power, and this was proved by the fact that the gathering of the Brethren from all parts of the United Xingdom had been brought together at the summons of the Grand Master of Mark Masons. Amongst those who were present from first to last were—Lord Leigh, the Earl of Limerick, Lord Skelnaersdale, the Earl Bective, Sir Frederick Wifliams, Colonel Burdett, Bro. the Rev. Raymond Portal, Mark Grand Master, and a long list of Grand Officers more or less distinguished Masons. The proceedings commenced at noon, and were continued until twelve at night, and of the 200 Brethren who were engaged in them many of them had travelled 800 miles to be present at this auspicious meeting. The Provincial Grand Lodge of Lancashire was opened punc - tually at one p.m., when the English Mark Masons com - posing it transacted the business of their province under the presidency of Bro. Romaine C~laiader. Half-an-hour later the Lancashire Mark Masons, who had been until now under the jurisdiction of the Grand Chapter of Scot - land, opened their Grand Lodge for the last time in Lan - cashire. Then followed the real business of the day, the"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE MARIC MASTERS DEGREE. business that had called so many Brethren together from distant parts. The Grand Master of Mark Masons took the chair, the articles of union between the two sets of Masons were read, and their fusion under one head, and with one code of constitutional regulations, formally agreed to, and adopted by th? consenting parties, Bro. Romaine Callander being reinstalled as Grand Master of the United Province, Bro. Lord Skelmersdale was ap - pointed his Deputy, and the odier Offices were regu1ari~ filled. No county could have more >stly claimed the honour of having this event occur in it than Lancashire, in which there are Seventy-six Craft Lodges, giving a result of some thousands of Freemasons. Brother Portal, as Mark Grand Master, gave eloquent testimony to the rapid pro - gress and enduring influence of this Dcgree, and Bro. Parkinson, in an eloquent discourse on the Degree, traced in the person of the Earl of Car~arvon, Lord Hohnersdale, the Earl of Limerick, Lord Leigh, and W. B. Beach, M.P., the indissoluble connection between the re-organized leaders of the Mark Degree and. Craft-Masoniy. “One of the traditions among Masons relates that the Degree of Mark Master Mason was instituted seven days after the foundation stone of King Solomon’s Temple was laid, when the three Grand Masters assembled, the Masters of all the Lodges of Fellow Crafts, and conferred on them this Degree. At the same time the Grand Masters established these admirable regulations for the inspection of the materials as they came from the quar - ries, which so readily enabled the Overseers to detect imperfect work. According to this tradition this Degree at its institution was conferred not only as an honorary reward for previous industry, skill, and fidelity, but also as an encouragement to persevere in well doing; it was"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"46 T~ MARK MASTER’S DEGREE. also still ftu’ther designed as a practical means for pre - serving due discipline and oversight at the erection of the Temple.” Section First eiplains the preparatory circumstances attending the advancement of the candidate, the stations and duties of the various officers, and the ceremonies of convocating and opening a Mark Master Lodge, and displays one of the principal events which characterizes this Degree. Section Two illustrates the foundation and hist~v of the Degree, and impresses upon the mind of the candidate, in a striking manner, the importance of a strict observance of his obligation to be ever ready to stretch forth his hand for the relief of indigent and worthy brethren. A variety of interesting circumstances connected with the building of King Solomon’s Temple are detailed, and the marks of distinction which were in use among our ancient brethren are expla.ined. We are indebted to Bro. Jas. L. Gould, M.A., 880, for the following remarks on this degree. “The Mark is the appropriate Jewel of a Mark Master Mason. The origin of the Mark is unknown. The traditions of the Order are to the effect that there were three classes of Fellow Crafts employed at the building of King Solomon’s Temple. One class wrought in the clayey grounds between Succoth and Zeradatha, the second in the forests of Lebanon, while the third or principal class was employed in the quarries of Zarthan. Those who wrought in the quarries were eighty thousand in number, divided into Lodges of eighty each. Over each of these Lodges presided a Mark Ma,Bter and two Mark Men as Wardens. Each of these Craftsmen was obliged to select a device which was recorded in a scroll kept for that purpose, and thereupon became the “Mark” of the brother, and could not be"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"T~E MAR1~ MASTER’S DEGREE. 47 altered or changed. A copy of this Mark the Craftsman was required to put on all his work, and thus every persons’ work could be readily distinguished, and praise or censure be correctly bestowed without mistakes. By this wise precaution such a vast body of men were easily and correctly paid, and by its means the workmen were enabled to put together with such facility and precision the materials when conveyed from the quarries to Mount Moriah. The Marks used by oiu ancient brethren are said to have been invented by Hiram Abiff, and consisted of combinations of the square, the level, the plump, and the cross. The touth of these traditions is verified by the fact that such marks were in use by the operative Masons of the Middle Ages. Steinbenner, in describing the giiilds of Stonemasons of Germany, says, that if the candidat&s qualifications were deemed satisfactory “he was at once taught the salute, or ‘Gruss,’ and the token or ‘Hand - schenk,’ by which he could make himself known as a travelling Fellow Craft. He also received a distinctive mark, which he was thenceforth obliged to place on all his work.” Similar marks are to be found among all ancient ruins, and great numbers of them have been collected and described by M. Didron, and also by G. Goodwin, Esq., a. member of the Society of Antiquaries. Within a. few years similar marks have been discovered in Mexico and .Central America.” The primary use of the Mark was, undoubtedly, that above mentioned, but they also very naturally came to be an equivalent in all transactions for the owner’s name, and hence their use in the payment of wages. Hence, too, the “Mark” became the Jewel of the Mark Master Mason, and was invested with the same properties as were at - tached to the Roman “Tessera Hospitalis,” or Hospitable token. When two persons in ancient times desired some"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"43 THE MARX MASTER’S DEGREE. emblem of their friendship, they selected a piece of bone, metal, or stone, and engraved upon it their names, their initials, or some device, this they divided into two pieces, each taking one. This was called a “Tessera Hospitalis.” and became the pledge of a friendship and attachment which nothing was permitted to destroy. The “Mark” may be made of any durable material, a&L is generally in the form of a “Key-stone,” on one side is engraved the owner’s name, chapter, and date of his advancement. On the other side must be engraved in a circular form the following eight letters—H. T. W. S. S. T. Ii. S. Within this circle of letters is engraved the device selected by the brother, and when once chosen the whole should be drawn or recorded in a book kept for that purpose, and it is then said to be recorded in the “Lodge Book of Marks.” The use of this Jewel is thus beautifully described by Dr. A. G. Mackey. “This Mark is not a mere orna - mental appendage of the Degree, but is a sacred token of the rites of frier~tship and brotherly love, and its presen - tation at any time by the owner to another Mark Master would claim from the latter certain acts of friendship which are of solemn obligation among the Fraternity. A Mark thus presented for the purpose of obtaining a favour is said to be pledged, though remaining in the possession of the owner. Nor can it be again used by him until, either by the return of the favour, or the consent of the benefactor, it has been redeemed; for it is a positive law of the Order that no Mark Master shall pledge his Mark a second time until he has redeemed it from its previous pledge.” The symbolic colour of the Mark Degree is purple. The Apron is of white lambskin, edged with purple, and the collar of purple, edged with gold."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"TIlE ~IARX MASTERS DEGREE. 4Q A Candidate receiving this Degree is said to be “ad - vanced to the honorary Degree of a Mark Master.” Lodges of Mark Master Masons are dedicated to H.A.B.

LECTURE. At the building of King Solomon’s Temple, and before the institution of the Degrees of M. M. and P. M., there were 80,000 operatives employed, part of whom were in the Quarries at Zarodather, and part builders of the Temple, besides these there was a levy of 70,000 in the Forests of Lebanbn. In order that each of these 150,000 workmen might be known to his superior officer, every portion of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE MARK MASTER’S DEGREE. 69 work was subjected to the nicest scrutiny, and each Fellow Craft received with punctuality the reward of his industry and skill; this immense number was divided into 1100 Lodges of Fellow Crafts and Elder Apprentices, the latter under the superintendence of the former, who taught them the work, and over the whole presided 3300 Menatschims, Overseers or Mark Masters, three over each Lodge. Each F. C. had a peculiar mark by which his work was known to his immediate Overseers, and on the other hand while the Overseers had but one mark in com - man with which they stamped the approval of a F. C.’s work, they had others by which they noted the Juxta - position of any two stones, thus without any difficulty was each individual’s work known and recognized, and its proper place indicated; the Masters Mark, the Triangle, refers to G. G. G. and Grd. Overseer of the Universe, to whom we must all submit, and ought most humbly to adore; these 3300 Overseers were again subdivided into 100 Lodges with 33 in each, over whom presided 300 Overseers also Mark Masters, these are now usually called W. M., S. W., and 3. W.; they were ~appointed by H. Abiff himself, and on them devolved the responsibility of paying the others their wages. When the F. C.’s and their Overseers or Mark M’asters went to receive their wages they put in their hands in a different manner and at a different wicket, so that if a F. C. presumed to put in his hand at a Mark Master’s Wicket he was immediately detected as an imposter, and as a punishment the 3. Ws. stood ready within armed, to chop off his hand. This constitutes a part of the penalty of a Mark Master, and this, as well as the other, was an ancient penalty amongst the Sidonians. It was the duty of the Overseers to examine each stone, not only as to its soundness by giving three blows with a"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"70 THE MARK MASTER’S DEGREE. Maul upon it, and as to its finish by turning it over, but also as to its being made in exact accord with the working plans previous to its being passed to the Master Overseer, whose duty it was to see that it was so; if found perfect in everyway, it received the Mark Master’s Mark, and was sent to the Temple, but if not, it was rejected. This was effected by two or more F. Cs. taking it between them thus —, and after swaying it backwards and forwards it was heaved over among the rubbish, a circumstance from which one of the Signs called the Heaving Over Sign is derived! The other Signs, viz.,—The Disconsolate, and the Sign of Th—, are of early date, their use in this Degree being ascribed to a circumstance which occurred at the building of K. S.’s Temple. Every six working days it was the custom of the Mark Masters to wait on. the acting Grand Master Hiram Abiff to receive the work. ing plans, as well as the instructions for carrying on the work, part of one of these plans appears to have been lost, but an ingenious and intelligent F. C., either having seen the perfect plan or forming a good opinion of it from the nature of the work, perceived that a stone of very peculiar construction was wanting to complete the design, pro - bably thinking to gain honor by displaying superior know - ledge, - he immediately commenced blocking out such a stone, and after spending much time and labour, ultimately finished it by putting his Mark upon it; when the work - ing plans were examined no place was found for this par - ticulsr •stone, and the F. C., instead of honor, received an~iy words and reproaches for idling away his time. The stone was ordered to be thrown aside, which was accordingly effected by two F.

The stone long lay hidden among the rubbish. At length, however, the time drew near when the Key-stone, to which the portion of the working plan above alluded to referred, was required, search was made at the Temple, but no such stone could be found, and on further exami - nation it was discovered that no stone of the requisite form and construction had been brought there. The Overseers of that portion of the building immediately sent to the Overseers of the Quarries, who had been entrusted with the plans and orders for this portion of the work, and received for answer that there was no plan for any such stone amongst those entrusted to their care. The work was at a standstill, and the reason was demanded by and explained to H. Abiff, who not only recollected drawing the plan and writing orders for that peculiar stone, but also giving them himself to the Mark Master, the latter was zepremanded for his carelessness in loosing any portion of his plans, and on learning the nature of the stone, it occurred to his recollection that one of a similar description had been cut by one of his workmen. He at once informed H. Abiff of this, adding that not finding it on his working plan he had refused to Mark it, and had caused it to be rejected; H. Abiff forthwith sent for the F. C. who. had cut the stone, and from his replies found that this must be the very stone required. Instant and careful search was ordered to be made for it, and it was at length found uninjured. To evince his approba - tion of the skill and ability displayed by the ingenious F. C., Hiram Abiff ordered that he should be forthwith Advanced to the Honble.

How says, “that, originally, the great feature of the present Royal Arch Degree was a .concluding section and completion of the Master Masons’. The loss and recovery were so arranged as to follow each other in the same ceremonial. This was undoubtedly the case at the time of the revival, A.D. 1717. “The Royal Arch Chapter as a separate body, but under the authority of the Grand Lodge, was established in London some time prior to 1780, but yet it did not receive the slightest notice from PRESTON in .his work of next year, a fact whieh would seem to warrant the conclusion that even then the Royal Arch was not in very high repute. Dr. Oliver, in his ‘Origin of the English Royal Arch,’ gives it as his opinion that the ‘Royal Arch’ originated in 1779. A Bro. who had received the Degree was said to have been ‘Passed’ to the ‘Supreme Degree of Excel - lent B~ A. Mason.’ The fist Book of Constitutions of"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"78 THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. the Royal Arch was issued in 1786, by the ‘Supreme Grand Chapter.’ The regulations contained in this Book of Constitutions were agreed to, May 10, 1772, and were, it is said, drawn up by Bro. THOs. DTJNCKERLY; a man of rare talents, and a great masonic celebrity of the eighteenth century. He is said to have been an illegitimate son of George II. He died at Portsmouth, in November, 1795, having been honored and esteemed by all who knew him.” In the Original Articles of the Union we md the second states that “It is declared and pronounced that pure Antient Masonry consists of three degrees, and no more, viz., those of the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow-Craft, and the Master Mason (including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch). But this article is not intended to prevent any Lodge or Chapter from holding a meeting in any of the Degrees of the Orders of Chivalry, according to the constitutions of the said Orders.” “As before remarked the Royal Arch was practiced as an appendage to the Third Degree for many years after its introduction. - “At that early period any Lodge convened a Chapter, and conferred the Royal Arch Degree, under the sancti.n of its own charter. Gradual steps were taken in process of time however, which; little by little, separated Capitular from Lodge Masonry, until distinct warrants were declared to be necessary to authorize the holding of Chapters; and the Order of the Ro~val -. Arch became, aftei the lapse of many years, an independarit Rite.” In fact there have been five different Rituals within the last century. The pres~iit ‘one was arranged by the Rev. Adam Brown, at .the in~tanc~ of H.R.H. the Duke of Sussex. The Royal Arch is worked from the tracing boards of HARRIS. Dublished uii~Ier ‘•the sanction of the Supreme"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. 79 Grand Chapter, and its Ritual differs from that in use at the Union in 1817. “According to the Constitutions it appears to be prac - tised as a Fourtk Degree, although the Articles of Union declare it to be a part of the Third. The Supreme Grand Chapter holds, theoretically, the position that ‘the Royal Arch is not essentially a Degree, but rather the perfection of the Third.’ In practice, however, the Degrees differ in design, in clothing, in constitutions, and in colour, and the proceedings are regulated by different governing bodies.” Dr. Oliver confesses that this position of the Degree is both anomalous and at variance with all the true principles of Masonry, whiie his own opinion seems to be that it should be made a part of the Third Degree (vide fist. Land., Vol. I., p. 470). “By the present Constitutions the Supreme Grand Chap - ter does not require the possession of anything more than the Master’s Degree as a pre-requisite for the Royal Arch. Any Master Mason of twelve months standing si eligible for the honors of the Royal Arch. Neither the Mark, Past, or Most Excellent Degrees are deemed pre-requisites, though all of them are conferred to some extent.” Webb says :—“ This Degree is more sublime and im - portant than any which precede it, and is the summit and perfection of Ancient Masonry. It impresses on our minds a belief of the being and existence of a Supreme Deity without beginning of days or end of years, and re - minds U8 of the reverence due to his Holy Name. It also brings to light many essentials of the Craft, which were, for the space of 470 years, buried in darkness, and without a knowledge of which the Masonic character can - not be complete.” “The Master Mason~. being only in possession of a sub - stituted word, the object of this Degree is to receive the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"80 THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. lost word, this was recovered in a secret vault beneath the Temple, which lay undiscovered for nearly five centuries, and which was brought ‘to light by the Sojourners who were digging for the foundations of the second Temple. “AC omp anion must have attained the rank of Master of a Lodge before he is eligible for the Third Principals’ Chairs, and he must also have served the office of Scribe or Sojourner. The other Chairs are only attainable at intervals of twelve months. These rules, however, are not enforced in the formation of a new Chapter.” The Badge consists of a Sash and Apron, the former being radiated with purple and crimson, the Apron being bordered with the same, the triple Tau being delineated on both. The Jewel worn on the left breast, suspended by a white ribbon (Principals have red), is a double triangle within a circle of gold, with symbols and inscriptions e~ngraved upon it. When he has passed the first chair a Companion gets another Jewel, which is a circle having on it a triangle, the back centre being a glory of rays, and on the whole a celestial crown, all gold. The Officers of a Chapter wear Crimson Collars, to which are suspended the Jewels of their respective offices. The three Principals have Sceptres, emblems of the regal, prophetical, and sacerdotal offices. The kingly robe is red, the prophetic purple, and the priestly blue. The other officers wear white robes. The Companions are arranged in the form of an Arch, and the newly-exalted companion is figuratively admitted through an Arch of Masonry.

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were our forefathers, Most Excellent; we are descended from the Princes and Rulers of Judah, who, for their sins and those of their forefathers, were led into capti~ity with their King Je - hoiachin by Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard of Nebu - chadnezzar, King of Babylon, where we were to remain for seventy years, as foretold by the prophet Jeremiah, anct then return to our native land and there dwell, our captivity having expired. In the first year of the reign of Cyrus, King of Persia, when it pleased the Almighty to inspire the mind of that young Prince to issue a procla - mation, sayi~ng, “All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of Israel given me, and hath commanded me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea, who are there amongst you of all His people, the Lord his God be with him, let him go up ?“ We eagerly availed ourselves of this permission; and we are come up accor - dingly to offer our assistance in re-building the Temple of the Lord God, who hath promised by the mouth of His Prophet to establish th~re His kiame for ever, and give peace to the whole earth.

A report is given, when Nehemiah having ascertained the cause, makes the following address) :— N.—Most Excellent, without the door are three Master Masons, who have made a discovery which they are anxious to impart. Z.—Let them be admitted. Z.—We understand you have made a discovery. P. 8.—Early this morning, on resuming our labour, we discovered a pair of pillars of exquisite workmanship; pro - ceeding onwards we discovered six other pairs of equal -beauty, and from their position appeared to us to have supported the roof of a subterranean passage communica - ting with the Most Holy Place; our progress being then obstructed by the fragments of the former structure, and having cleared them away, we arrived at what at ~rst had the appearance of a solid rock, but accidentally striking it with the crow-bar I remarked a .hollow sound, I therefore hailed my companions, who, with the pickaxe loosened the earth for some distance, which my companions with a spade cleared away, when we perceived that instead, of a solid- rock there was a series of stones in the form of a dome. Aware who was the Architect of the former struc - ture, and that no part of it had been constructed in vain, we determined to examine it, and for which purpose we removed two of the cope-stones, when a vault of consider-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. 89 able magnitude appeared to view, and we determined on a descent, all being desirous, we cast lots who should; the lot, Most Excellent, fell on me, and lest any noxious vapours or other causes should render my position unsafe, my companions fastened this cord or life-line round my waist, by which they could lower me into the vault or raise me out according to the signal I gave to my right or left hand companion. In this manner I descended through the aperture which we had made, and on arriving at the bottom I gave the agreed on signal, and my com - panions gave me more line, which enabled me t6 encom - pass the vault, and I felt something in the form of a pedestal of a column, and could also feel certain characters thereon, but for the want of light I was unable to discover what they were; I also laid hold of this Scroll, but from the same cause I was unable to read its contents, I there - fore gave another preconcerted signal and -was drawn up, and on arriving in the light of day we discovered from the flrst sentence of the scroll that it contained the Volume of the Most Holy Law, which had been promulgated by our Grand Master Mason at the foot of Mount Sinai. This precious treasure stimulated oar exertions still further; we increased the aperture by the removal of other stones, and I again descended into the vaulted chamber. The sun had now gained its altitude, and darted its rays of light more immediately into the aperture, and I then per - ceived a pedestal of pure virgin marble in the form of an altar of incense—that of a double cube; on the front thereof was engraven the names of the three Grand Masters who presided over the Sacred Lodge, and certain mystic characters engraved on- its plinth, whilst a veil covered the face of the altar.

Z.—Give us the word you discovered. P. S.—That, Most Excellent, we would wish to decline, for we have heard with our ears, and our forefathers have declared unto us, that in their days, and in the old time before them, that it was not lawful for any but the High Priest to mention the name of the living God, nor him but once in every year, when he entered the Holy of Holies, and stood before the Ark of the Covenant, to make pro - pitiation for the sins of Israel. Z.—We commend your pious caution, and will comm.is - sion certain of our companions to examine and report to us the extent of your discovery. (The Sojourners now retire to the extremity of the Chapter with Ezra and Nehemiah, and on their return, after unveiling the pedestal, they, Ezra and Nehemiah, address the Most Excellent and say, “It is correct.”) Z.—Companions Ezra and Nehemiah divest.them of the implements of labour, clothe them with the robes of innocence and truth, and instruct them to advance to - .wards us.

J.—There are three epochs in Masonry which peculiarly merit youz~ttention: The History of the First, or Holy Lodge; the Second, or Sacred Lodge; and the Third, or Grand and Royal Lodge. The First, or Holy Lodge, was opened An.no Lucas, 2415, two years after the departure of the Children of Israel from their Egyptian bondage, by Moses, Ajiohab, and Bezaliel, on consecrated ground, at t]ie foot of Mount Horeb, in the Wilderness of Sinai, where the host of Israel pitched their tents and assembled -to offer up their prayers and thanksgivings for their signal deliverance from the hands of the Egyptians. In this place -Llie Aimighty had revealed bimself before to His faithful servant, Moses, when He commissioned him His I"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"92 THE HOLY ROYAL AXCH DEGEE~. high Ambassador of wrath again5t Pharaoh and his people, and of freedom and salvation to the house of Jacob. Here were delivered the forms of those my5ter.ious prototypes, the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant; here were also delivered the Sacred Law, engraven by the hands of the Ii’Iost High, with those sublime &ud compre - hensive precepts of religious and mor~i1 duty, and here also were dictated by His unerring wisdom, those peculiar forms of a religions and civil polity which, by s~parating His favourite people from all other nations, consecrated Israel a chosen people foi’ His service; for these reasons we denominate this the First, or Holy Lodge. —:0:— SECOND, OR SACRED LODGE. J.—Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, presided over the Second or Sacred Lodge, opened Anno Lucas 2992, in the bosom of the holy Mount Moriali, under the very centre of the place where the solemn Sanhedrim was afterwards erected. On this con. secrateci spot Abraham proved his constructive faith by leading his only and bGloved son a destined victim on the alt&r of his God. Here, on the thrashing floor of Araun&h, the Jebu5ite, Da~vid offered the mediatoria.! sacrifice by which the plague was stayed; and here he received in a vision the plan of that glorious temple wbich was afterwards completed by his illustrious son; and in this place had God declared he ‘would establi5la his Most Holy Name; therefore we distinguish this the Sacred, or Second Lodge."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. 93 THIRD, OR GRAND AND ROYAL LODGE. J.—The Grand and Royal Arch Lodge was holden at Jerusalem, and opened Anno Lucas 8469, after the return f the Israelites from captivity, under Zerubbabel, the Prince of the people, Haggal the prophet, and Jeshua the ~on of Josedech, the High Priest. Now it was that the Idngly power was restored, in. the person of Zerubbabel, to the royal line of David, and princely tribe of Judah; nor was there again any vestige effaced until the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, under Titus, in the seven - tieth year of the Christian era, thereby verifying the pre - diction of Judali, in Egypt) “that the sceptre should not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from beneath his feet, until Shiloh came to commemorate this restoration.” It is called the Tbird, or Grand, and Royal Lodge, and the resemblance in the Chapter before us :epresent those great originals that are in every regular Royal Arch Chapter. We acknowledge the representation of the Grand, and Royal Lodge at Jerusalem, in the persons of the three principals Zertibbabel, Haggal, and Jeshna, whose names they also bear; the two Scribes represent Ezra and Nehe - rniah, the expounders of the Sacred Law, and the atten - dants on the august Sanhedrim, by whose names they also are designated. Yourselves (addressing the three So - journers) represent the faithful Sojourners by whom the secrets of the Royal Arch were discovered, and for whteh they were honoured with a seat in the august assembly, composed of the rulers and elders of the people, repro.. sented by the rest of the Companions now present. 5ECOI4D CHAIR. H.—Companion, when you were initiated in Maso~jr,~ you were informed there were three degrees, the Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, and that I"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"94 THE HOLY ROYAL AXCH DEGREE. the secrets entrusted to your care were not the genuine ones, those having been lost by the untimely death of our Master Hiram Abiff, prince of architects, and in the belief that they were lost for ever King Solomon ordered that those secrets which had been discovered (or rather made use of) by the brothers sent to find and raise the body of our Master Hiram should henceforth be adopted as the substituted secrets of the Master Mason’s degree. The Supreme Degree to which you have been admitted this day is the real Master Mason’s degree, and the secrets supposed as irrecoverably lost by the death of our Master Hiram Abiff, discovered in the manner before related to you, are the real secrets of a ~‘Iaster Mason before the assassination of Hiram Abiff. 5Y~IEOLIC EXPLANATION. H. (continues.—The forms, symbols, and ornaments of Royal Arch Masonry, as well as the rites and ceremonies at present in use amongst us, were adopted by our pre - decessors at the building of the second Temple, as well to preserve in our minds the providential means by which the grand discovery was effected, as in our hearts the lessons of that eialted mora3i1~y which, as members of this supreme Degree, we are bQund to practise. The form in which the Companions of every Royal Arch Chapter are arranged approach as near as circumstances will admit to that of the true caten&rian arch. Thus we preserve the memorial of the vaulted shrine, in which the sacred word was deposited, which form the impenetrable nature of the strongest of all architectural forms, we learn the necessity of guarding our mysteries from profanation by the most inviolable secrecy. It also strongly typifies that ad - herence to order, and the spirit of fraternal union that has given energy and permanency to the constitutions of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. fr[asonry, enabling it to survive the wreck of mighty empires, and resist the destroying hand of time. And as the subordinate members of the catenarian arch naturally gravitate to the centre, or key-stone, which compress or cement the whole structure, so are we taught to look up with reverence, and submit with cheerfulness, to every lawfully constituted authority, whether Masonic or civil regulation. The cope-stones are represented by the three principals of the Chapter, for as the knowledge of the Secrets contained in the Vaulted Chamber could only be obtained by d.rawing forth the three first of a series oi stones, therefore the complete knowledge of this Supreme Order can only be obtained by passing through those several offices. In this degree we acknowledge six Lights; the three lesser together represent the light of the Law and the Prophets, and by their number allude to the Patri - archal, Mosaical, and Prophetical dispensations, the three greater representing the Sacred Word itself; these lights are placed in the form of an equilateral triangle, each of the lesser intersecting the line formed by two of the greater, thus geometrically dividing the greater triangle into three lesser triangles in the centre, all of them equal and equilateral. This symbolic arrangement corresponds to the mysterious T. H., or Triple Tan,. which forms two right angles on each of the exterior lines, and two others at their centre, by their union, for the three angles of each triangle are equal to two right angles. This illustrates the Jewel worn by the Companions of the Order, which forms, by its intersections, a given number of angles. These may be taken in five several combinations, and when reduced into their amount in right angles, will be found equal to the five platonic bodies which represent the four elements and the sphere of the universe. The Ribbon worn by the companions of the order is a sacred emblem,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"96 THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. denoting Light, being composed of two different or prin - cipal colours, purple, radiated with crimson, with which the veil of the Temple was also interwoven; the same is further signified by its irradiated form, and in both these respects it has ever been considered as an emblem of royal power and dignity. The Ensigns which the Companions bear on their staves were the distinguished bearings of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and figuratively of the peculiar blessings bequeathed to each by the patriarch Jacob, who, before his death, assembled them together for that pu.r - pose, as we find recorded in the 49th chap. of Genesis. The principal Banners are the standards of the leading tribes of the four divisions of the army of Israel, and, unitedly, bear a device of an angelic nature, under the combined figures of a Man, a Lion, an Ox, and an Eagle. A Man to represent integrity and understanding, a Lion to personify strength and power, an Ox to denote the ministration of patience and assiduity, and an Eagle to display the promptness and celerity with which the will and pleasure of the Creator are ever executed. A detail of the tribes attached to each division, and names of their Commanders, will be found in the Second chap. of Num - bers. The bearings of the Sceptres denote the regal, pro - phetical, and sacerdotal offices, which are now, and still ought to be, conferred in a peculiar manner, and accom - panied with the possession of particular Secrets. The Bible, Compasses, and Square, are considered as appro - priate emblems of the three Grand Masters who founded the ~.rst Temple. The Bible denotes the wisdom of King Solomon. The Square, the power of Hiram of Tyre, and the Compasses the exquisite skill of Hiram Abiff.

The Pick- axe, Crow-bar, and Shovel were the first implements used. by the Sojourners to clear away the foundation of the second Temple—the Pick-axe to loosen the earth, the Crow-bar to take purchases, and the Shovel to clear away the rubbish. These we spiritualize thus: the sound of the stroke of the Pick-axe reminds us of the sound of the last trumpet, when the graves shall be shaken, opened, and deliver up their dead. The Crow-bar being an emblem of uprightness, represents the erect manner in which the body shall arise on that awful day to meet its tremendous but merciful Judge. The mortal state in which the body is laid in the grave, is powerfully im - pressed on our minds by the work of the Shovel, so that when the rubbish of the body shall be properly disposed"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"98 THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGEEE. of, we, with confidence, hope the Spirit will arise into im - mortal and eternal life. PRAYER GIVEN BY THE SECOND CHAIR IN CONCLUsION. Supreme and incomprehensible I AM, may the sincerity of our feeble exertions meet with Thy Divine approbation, and may our endeavours to disseminate the knowledge and light of Thy most Holy Word, be crowned with success through Thy all powerful protection. MYSTIC EXI~LANATION GIVEN BY THE FIRST CHAIR. Z.—The mystic knowledge of this Degree comprehends the form and explanation of the Sacred Secrets, the nature and import of the Holy Word, and the traditional cere - mony used in sharing and communicating our Secrets in Royal Arch Masonry. There are five Secrets correspon - ding in number to the five Points of Fellowship, in which the Master Mason is instructed, and as those point out to us the relative duties we owe to each other, so do the Secrets of a Royal Arch Mason mark, in a peculiar man - ner, the relation we bear to the Almighty, as creatures offending against His power, yet the adopted chiUren of His mercy. Now follow the five Secrets, viz.: THE FIRST—OR PENAL SIGN. Z.—The PENAL SIGN marks our O.B., and is given thus , and reminds us of the, fall of Adam, and the dreadful penalty entafled by all his sinful posterity, no less than death, intimated by the action itself, that the stiff neck of the disobedient shall be cut off from the land of the living by the judgment of God, even as the head is severed from the body by the sword of human justice, to ave±t which we axe taught by the— I"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. 99 sECOND—REvERENTIAL, OR HAILING 5IGN~, GIVEN THU5 which teaches us to bend with submissive resignation beneath the chastening hand of the Almighty, and at the same time to engraft His law in our hearts. In this expressive form did the Father of the human race first present himself before the Most High to receive the denunciation of His just and terrible judgment. It was also adopted by our Grand Master Moses, when the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush; Moses covered his face from brightness of the Divine presence, and laid his hand on his heart, in token of obedience and salutation, which was afterwards accounted to him for righteousness. THE THIRD—PENITENTIAL, OR 5UPPLICATORY SIGN, GIYEN THUS may be considered as the parent of the Reverential or Hailing Sign. It justly denotes that frame of mind and heart, without which our prayers and oblations of praise would not obtain acceptance at the throne of grace, before whfch how should a frail and erring creature of the dust present himself unless with bended knees and uplifted hands, betokening at once his humility and dependance? In this humble posture did Adam kneel to God and bless the Author of his being. Thus did he bend with contrite awe before the face of his offended Judge, to avert His wrath, and conciliate His mercy, and has transmitted the sacred form to his posterity for ever. THE FOtLETH—MONITORL&L, OR SIGN OF SUFFERING, GIVEN THUS reminds us of the weakness of human nature, unable of itself to resist the powers of darkness, unless aided by that help which is from above. By this defenceless posture we acknowledge our own frailty, and confess that we can do H2"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"100 THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. no good or acceptable service but through Him, from whom all good counsels and just works proceed, and without whose Divine and special favour we must ever be found unprofitable servants in His sight; therefore, adopting the• manner of our ancestors and atoning priests by this form of contrition and humility. THE FIFTH—FThUCIAL, OR FAITH AND HOPE sIGN, GIVEN THUS as if we would postrate ourselves on the face of the earth ~ we must thus throw ourselves upon the mercy of our Creator and our Judge, looking forward with confidence to His gracious premises, by which alone we hope to pass through the Ark of our redemption in the presence of Him who is the great I.A.M., the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending. Z.—On the front of the pedestal are engraven the names of the three Grand Masters who presided over the building of the former Temple, viz.:—Solomon King of Israel, Hiram King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, and are meant to perpetuate the erection of the former Temple. There is likewise a triple Tau, or letter T, a mark or character affixed to the summons of Royal Arch Masons when sum - moned on other than usual occasions. The triple Tau is. translated from the Hebrew, a mark .or sign spoken of by Ezekiel, when he said to the man with the inkhorn, “Go thy way through the midst of the city of Jerusalem, and. set a mark on all those who sigh . and. lament for the abomination thereof.” By which mark they were saved from among those who were slain for their idolatory by the wrathful displeasure of the Most High. In ancient times the mark was placed on the forehead of all those who were acquitted by their judges, as a proof of their innocence; and military commanders caused a T to be nlaced on all those who had escaped unhurt from the field"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. 101 of battle, denoting that they were in perfect life; it has, therefore, ever been considered the mark of life. The union of the three T’s, or Triple Tau, allude to the grand tn-union of the Deity, by whom the horrific, gloomy, and unshapen chaos was changed into form and existence. Z. (continues).—The word you observe on the Triangle, is the sacred word which you. have promised anti sworn never to divulge, unless with the assistance of three or more Royal Arch Masons lawfully congregated, con - stituted, and dedicated, which, as principal of this Chap - ter, I am authorised. to prononce. It is in itself a com - pound word, and its combination forms the word 5. B. 0., the Chaldean name of God, 5. or Jah, signifying His essence of Majesty incomprehensible, it is also a Hebrew word, signifying I Am, and shall be, thereby expressing the actual future and eternal existence of the Most High. B. is an Assynian word signifying Lord, or powerful; it is also a compound word, from the proposition Beth, which signifies in, or an heaven, or on high; therefore .this word means Lord in heaven, or on high. 0. is an Egyptiaia word, signifying “Father of All,” it is also an Hebrew word, implying strength and power, and expressive of the Omnipotence of the Father of all; taking each together will read this—I Am, and shall be Lord in heaven, Father of all, in every age, in every clime, adored by savage and by sage. Jehovah, Jove, or Lord. The word on the Cube is the grand, awful, tremendous, and incom - prehensible name of the Most High, signifying I Am, the beginning, and the ending, which was, and is to come, the actual future, and all-sufficient God, who alone has His living in, and of himself, and gives to all others their being; that He was, and shal he both what He was, and what He is, from everlasting to everlasting, all the crea - tion being dependent on His mighty wifl. The Cube"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"102 THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. typifies the Omnipotent and Almighty Author of the uni - verse, having neither beginning nor ending; it also calls to our remembrance the grand and awful hereafter, or futurity, where we hope to enjoy endless bliss and ever - lasting life. The characters which are placed on each angle of the Cube are Hebrew, and particularly worthy of your attention. The Aleph, answering to our A; the Beth, to our B; and the Lamed to our L; take the Aleph. and the Beth, and they form the word “A. B.,” meaning “Father ;“ take the Aleph and the Lamed, the word A.L., which means “Word;” take the Lamed—the Aleph—and. the Beth, they form the word L.A.B., meaning Spirit; take the Beth—Aleph—and Lamed—the word B.A.L., meaning Lord; take each angle of the triangle, they will form the following sentences—”Father Lord,” “Word Lord,” “Spirit Lord.” The Tau was, in the days of’ Pythagoras, esteemed as the most sacred of all emblems, and when any oath of more than usual import was to be administered, it was given on the Tan, and when s& administered none ever were known to have violated it. The ancient Egyptians called it the sacred number—three or number of perfection, and was an object of worship- amongst the ancients as the grand principle of animated existence, and they gave it the name of “God,” represent. - ing the animal, vegetable, and mineral creation; it was. also called “Avolet,” that is to say, the Soul of Nature.. The Sacred Tan is usually placed in the midst of squares. and circles, indicating the vivifying principles, extending its ramifications Throughout all created matter; it is therefore denominated the Great All, or Summum Bonum.. THE OUMA~ OF ROYAL ARCH MASO1~URY. This sublime degree is the climax of Masonry, and is"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. log intimately blended with all that is near and dear to us in another state of existence—our divine and human affairs are so interwoven, so awfully, and so minutely in all its disquisitions; it has virtue for its aim, the glory of God its object, and the eternal welfare of man is considered in every point or letter of its ineffable Mysteries. Suffice it to say, that this Degree is founded on the name of Jehovah, who was from all eternity, is now, and shall be, one and the same for ever, the being naturally existing of, and from himself, all actual perfection originally in His essence. This sublime Degree inspires its members with the most exalted ideas of God, and leads to the exercise of the most pure and sublime piety, a reverence for the in - comprehensible Jehovah, the Eternal Ruler of the tTni - verse—the element of life, the primordial source of all its principles, the very spring and fountain of all its virtues. :0:— PASSING THE VEILS. (This ceremony is sometimes dispensed with.) THE CANDThATE I5~ PREPARED AS BEPORZ. The three Sojourners act as the guardians of the three Veils.

He enters the Second Veil, in which is the figure of a Serpent and Aaron’s rod. Ezra then reads Exodus 4, ver. 1 to 5 in - clusive. The Candidate is then desired to pick up the B— cast down before him, this act is the Sign of the Second Veil, and the Pass Words are M— A— and B—; with these words he passes the Guard of the Third Veil. Ezra then reads Exodus 4, ver. 6 to 9; the L. H. and P. 0. 0. W. are the signs of the Third Veil, and the Pass Words to the Sanctum Sanctorum are H. T. T. L. He is then shewn the Ark of the Covenant which contains the tables of stone, the pot of manna, the table of shew bread, the burning incense, and the candlestick with seven branches, after which he is withdrawn to enter a~ a So - journer. —:0:— TO CLOSE THE CHAPTER. The Most Excellent knocks to order, and asks if there is anything to offer for the benefit of the Chapter. After ascertaining there is not, he again knocks to order, and finishes by saying, As we three do agree, In Peace, Love, and Unity, The Sacred Word to keep, So we three do agree, In Peace, Love, and Unity, The Sacred Word to keep, Until we three, Or such as we shall agree This Royal Arch Chapter to open."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"TEE HOLY ROYAL ARCH DEGREE. 105 which is repeated by the Companions. He then gives one knock with his Sceptre, which is followed by one each by Haggai and Jeshua. The Most Excellent then gives an - other knock, making together four, and says to the Prin - cipal Sojourners, “The labours of the evening being ended, you have my commands to close the Chapter.” P.S.—In the name of the Most High and by command of the Most Excellent I close the Chapter until, etc. (Each Companion salutes the Volume of the Sacred Law, ending with the Most Excellent Zerubbabel.) One of the Past Zerubbabels comes forward and says, “Nothing remains, etc,” the same as in Craft; Masonry, repeating “Fidelity” four times. —:0:— CHARGE GIVEN WHEN THE CHAPTER 15 CLOSED BEFORE THE COMPAX - IONS HAVE SEPARATED.

But, my Brethren and Companions, you are to extend those noble and generous sentiments still farther; let me impress on your minds, and let it be instilled into your hearts, that every human being has an undoubted claim to your kind offices; we therefore strictly enjoin you to do good to all, while we more particularly recommend to your care the household of the faithful—that by diligence and fidelity in the duties of your respective vocations, liberal benevolence and di - ifusive charity; constancy and sincerity in your friend - ship; uniform, kind, just, amiable, and virtuous in your deportment, you will prove to the world the happy and beneficent effects of our ancient and honourable institu - tion.

The Labartim consists of the two first letters of Obristos, in Greek chaxacters, placed so as to form a Cross.

Elisebius, bishop of Nicomedia, who was thus considered the second officer of the Order. After the death of Con - stantine, and the division of the Empire, the Order is said to have flourished, more especially under the reigns of the Emperors Marcian and Leo I., but considerable obscurity envelopes its history until the year 1190, when it was re - vived by the Emperor Isaac Angelus Commenus on a scale of increased splendour. From this period down to 1699 the Grand Mastership was vested in the Commenian family, who were considered to be the lineal descendants of Constantine, and on the resignation of that dignity by Andrew Angelus Flavius Commenus, titular Prince of Macedonia and Duke of Drivasto, he pretended to assign his heriditary rights to Francis Farnese, the then reigning Duke of Parma. The Grand Crosses of the Order, one of whom was the Abbe’ Giuistiniani, continued however to exercise their undoubted privilege of conferring the Red Cross upon worthy men; and we are in all probability indebted to the learned Abbe’, who was long attached to the Venetian Embassy in London for the existence of the Order in England (vide memoirs~of Abbe’ Giuistiniani). It is beyond dispute that the members of the English branch during the 18th century were men of high position in society, and of eminence in the Masonic Order; though, like the Knights Templar, we are unable to say positively when the Order was restricted to Freemasons.” Iii the Roll of the Order in 1788 several distinguished Free - masons’ names appears, and in 1796 Lord Rancflffe, Grand Master of the Knight Templars, was at the same time head of the Red Cross. Iii 1808. the present Constitution and Laws were confirmed, ~nd the first High Council, Grand Council,’ or Grand Chapter, for all these titles are used to designate the ru]ing body, was elected.

But this Article is not intended to prevent any Lodge or Chapter from holding a meeting in any of the Degrees of the Orders of Chivalry, according to the Con - stitutions of the said Orders.” Now at that period the Knights Templar and the Knights of the Red Cross and K. H. S. were the only organized Chivalric Orders existing in England, and Tconsequently the above permissive clause applies solely to their members.” The Order appears to have languished for some years between the date of 1837 to 1865, when the Grand Council was again reconstituted, and since this revival the Order has made a most rapid and unjnterrupted progress. The principles of the Order are Faith, Unity, and Zeal, a firm belief in the New Covenant, Fraternal Union, and the advantages of Zeal in every good cause. Any M.

D. 818, as a memorial of the Divine miracle which effected his conversion to the Christian faith, and also as a reward for the valour of certain of his Soldiers. Our Order is therefore not only the most ancient, but the most honour- able institution of Christian Knighthood recorded in the pages of history; and it behoves us, beloved Sir Knights, to prize the privileges which we have obtained as descen -"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"122 THE RED CROSS OF ROME AND CONSTANTINE DEGREE. dants of these worthy men, ever remembering the watchwords of our Conclave—” Faith, Unity, and Zeal.” Before proceeding to relate the circumstance of Constan - tine’s conversion, which produced such momentous results, I may first observe that in tracing the influence of this great event upon the world in general, it is more particu - larly our duty as Masons to remember that our Royal Founder had been, at an early period of his life, initiated into the Mysteries of the “Collegium Artificium” at Rome, and had attained the position of Magister, or Master, of the College of Architects, and it was doubtless this early training which had sufficiently enlightened his mind to perceive the errors and absurdities of paganism, and caused him to eagerly desire a more complete knowledge of the unknown deity worshipped in those ancient mys - teries. When he arrived at the Imperial dignity, not even the cares of empire, or the responsibilities of command, could erase those ideas, or restrain his profound researches after truth and wisdom. The manner of his conversion is thus related: one evening the army being on its march towards Rome, Constantine—reflecting upon the fate of sublunary things and the dangers of his approach- hag expedition, and sensible of his own incapacity to succeed without Divine assistance—meditating also upon the various religious opinions which then divided man - kind—sent up his ejaculations to Heaven for inspiration and wisdom to choose the right path to be persued. The G. A. of the U. heard his prayer, for as the sun was declining there suddenly appeared a pillars of Jiglit in the Heavens in the shape of a Cross, with this inscrip - tion, “In Hoc Signo Yinces.”—In this Sign thou shalt conquer. So extraordinary an appearance created the utmost astonishment in the mind of the Emperor and his whole army. The Pagans deemed it a most inauspicious"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"ThE RED CROSS OF ROME AN~D CONSTANTINE DEGREE. 123 omen; but Constantine being reassured by the visions of the night, at dawn of day caused a royal standard to be made like that which he had seen in the Heavens, and commanded it to be carried before him in his wars, as an ensign of victory and celestial protection. Several Christian Masons among the soldiers, no longer fearing persecution, then came forward to avow their faith, and the Emperor in order to commemorate the event, directed them to wear upon their armour a iRed Cross, with 16 Stars denoting the sixteen letters of the mystic words. On returning to his capital, Constantine, with the assistance of Eusebius, opened a Conclave of Knights of this Order, and these valiant and illustrious men were ever afterwards the body guard of their Sovereign. The Rose and the Lily were adopted by our Royal Founder as emblems of the Divine Being he had learned to adore —mystically representing the Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley. Among the acts of Constantine, his encouragement of learning is conspicuous: he commanded the Scriptu.res to be carefully kept and frequently read in all Churches; he also devoted the 4th part of his revenue towards the relief of the poor, and for other pious purposes. His tomb, of grey marble, continues at Constantinople to this day, and even its present possessors retain a vener - ation for the memory of the illustrious Constantine. Three hundxed years had the persecution of our Brethren continued when it ceased with this great Emperor, who laid a lasting foundation for the honour of the Christian name. Upon this account his memory will flourish in the minds of all good men and Christian Masons until time shall be no more. -(The Newly-installed Knight then takes his seat as a member.)

We have unfurled to-day the banner of the Cross—the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE RED CROSS OF ROME AND CONSTANTINE DEGREE. 129 highest and holiest ensign ever lifted up for man to follow and to revere. We bear aloft the standard of our Illustrious Founder whereon is delineated a faint resem - blance of the sacred vision of old which startled the solid phalanx of the Roman Legion and bowed the heads of princes to the dust. With this Divine Symbol before us the remote and marvellous past seems recalled from its shadowy grave. Again—” The Cross triumphant blazes in the sky;” its influence as great, its inspirations as exalted in 0-ar own day and generation, as when Constan - tine, clad in resplendent armour, charged at the head of his warrior Knights ‘and routed the host of the tyrant. The Labarum or device adopted by Constantine was a Monogram of the Clii and the Eho—the two first letters of Christos in Greek characters. This emblem was placed on the battle flags of the Roman empire, and in after years the Red Cross banner led to victory those pious champions of the Cross who devoted their lives to the rescue of the Holy Land from its infidel oppressors. Since the period of the Crusades, no less than thirty four princes of the Imperial House of Commenes have been Grand Masters of our Fraternity, and the most illustrious men in England, including the Royal Sussex and our present noble chief, have been found amongst its rulers and Sovereigns, and I trust this will ever be the case with an Order of Knighthood, which the Abbe’ Giustiniani declared in 1692, to be the most ancient in the world. On this auspicious occasion it may not be deemed inopportune briefly to consider the precepts that are taught, and the objects desired to be attained by all who have entered sincerely into communion with our Christian Order.

By these means alone we hope to rebuild in our hearts the myste - rious Temple of the triune God. Unity is the mighty chain by which we, as brethren, are bound together and enabled to achieve great things. It is the support and bond of friendship, the cement of bro - therly love, the wond.rous lever by which immortal truth is raised out of the chasms of darkness, where error and Buperstition hold sovereign sway. Without unity we can - not become a happy and prosperons community; let us therefore strive to preserve this vital principle by being kind and forbearing to all, by forgiving injury, and over - looking injustice, by a readiness at all times to stretch forth a helping hand to the unfortunate, to sorrow with those overcome with grief, and to rejoice with those whose hearts are full of gladness. Zeal is the grand permeating fire of the soul, which stimulates our desires into action, and animates our labours. Without zeal the potent thoughts of sages, the profound ideas of philosophers, would remain in obscurity, like the unhewn statue in the quarry; but kindled into light and life by this o’ermastering spirit, they assume shape and substance, and ripen into glorious realities. Having thus directed your attention more particularly to the inspiring watchwords of our conclave, I would further impress upon your minds that Charity and Truth are also essential attributes of the Order, and that we are bound to practise in our daily life, the holy precepts taught by our Divine and Almighty Sovereign. Again, I would in- treat you to guard well the vestibule of our Temple, and suffer none to pass its sacred threshold but brethren faith - ful and true, who have 8hown a Christian disposition to-"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE RED CROSS OF ROME A~ CONSTANTINE DEGR~EE. 181. wards their feflowmeu, and whose future conduct, you feel assured, will reflect no discredit upon the Order.

The Architects and - Bi.tilders (who, it is traditionally asserted, were all mem - bers of this Christian Order) were employed in laying out the ground for the future city when an Eagle suddenly swooped down, seized the measuring line, and carried it away to Byzantium; the Emperor having noticed the direc - tion of the Eagle’s ifight, and considering it a special indi - cation from Heaven, ordered his Architects to cease their labours on the site he had previously selected and to"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"[50 THE RED CROSS OF ROME AND CONSTANTINE DEGREE. proceed to Byzantium, where they laid the foundation of Constantinople, which eventually became the Metro - polis of the Eastern World.

In a work written by itt. BosetLi it is a.Bserted that the Templars where a branch of the Masonic institution, whose object was the over tbzow of the Papal Power, this assertion is much to be doubted. Bro. J. Howe, in his excellent work entitled “The Free - masons Manual,” gives a full historical: account of the Tern - plax Degree, to which work we are indebted for the follow - ing quotations relating to their history, &o. “The wonder - ful Architectural and Engineering works which, both in Asia ~ Thirope, were constructed wader the direction of the ~emp1ars and Hospittallers—more particularly the former —.are, it seems to us, very striking eyidenoe of the Masonic origin of the Knights. Gervase of Canterbury, who wrote in the 12th century, spea~ka of both French and EngliBh artificers ski]ful to work in stone and wood, who travelled in guilds or SOcietieS for the purpose of proffering their services whereyer the Architects and Builders Art required to be exercised. These were the only men who possessed the requisite knowledge, and from their ranks Kings and Princes fre - quently impressed by violence workmen whom they required to construct their palaces or fortresses, they ~were the operative Freemasons to whose surpassing skill, and ]mowledge of the laws of beauty aad just proportion, we are"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158 ThE KIIIGETS TEMPLAR DEGREE. indebted for the magnificent Cathedrals which adorn this~ country and the Continent. They met in Lodges close tiled from the vulgar gaze, and persued the practice ot their mystic rites under the sanction of the Throne and the Church. During the first Crusade we have no record of any building constructed by the warrior pilgrims; but at a later date, after the institution of the Orders of the Temple and St. John, castles, churches, palaces, ani hospitals speedily arose on all sides. Their fortresses were of wondrous strength, and showed great skill iu engineering, but supposing the mysteries of the Templars might not have been wholly connected with those of Freemasonry still there can be little doubt that many of the Templar Order were Freemasons and initiated into the secrets of occult philosophy or the Bosicrucian Order. The fliustrious Order of the Temple has through many vicissitudes survived to our time, and indeed of late years a great and we may say• astonishing influence has been exercised in the Masonic Craft by this brotherhood in Eng~ land, on the Continent of Europe; and in the United States. Not’withstanding the persecution the Order was subjected to, consequent upon the macinations of Philip Le Bel and Pope Clement, it continued to exist if not to fiouri~h. Jaques de Molay, the martyred Grand Master, in antici. pation of his fate, appointed his successor to rule the Fraternity, and from that time to the present there has been an uninterrupted succession of Grand Masters. Ia the Preceptories of the Order in Englaid the secrets imparted to the newly installed brother of the Temple included for many years the degrees known as Knight of St. John and Knight of Malta. With these were also conferred the “Rose-Croix of Heredom,” -one of the higher degrees, which it is said was originally brought into this Country from Scotland, and the “Kadosh,” or ne pita. ultra I"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE KHIGHTS RMPLAR DEGREE. 159 of Masonry. Of the Kadosh there are said to be sit degrees, and however worked, we~ are at liberty to say that there is little doubt that they are intimately connected with the ancient ceremonies of the Order of the Temple. The influence of this Noble Order has been widely exercised on the Continent. In France and Italy chap - ters of the chivalric degrees have always been held, and batterly under the sanction of the Church. At Sonnen - berg, in Germany, there was a Grand Encampment of the Knights of St. John early in the present century, where several German princes were elevated to the privileges of the Order; in Prussia the Military Orders flourish, and there is good ground for tracing their preservation up to the Teutonic Order, the Knights of which were the origin - al Founders of the power of the Prussian Monarchy. It is not unreasonable to conclude that a portion of the perse - cuted brotherhood of the Temple sought refuge with their more prosperous fellow-soldiers of the Teutonic Order, and that their Secrets and ceremonies may have been thus perpetuated in the North of Europe, while the Knights of St. John preserved them in the South. “The Templar Degree derived its origin in this country from two sources—France and Germany, the Cross of It. Encampment held at Clerkenwell was of French origin; the “Observanc6” was from Germany.” “The Knights Templar Degree is highly valued in all countries, and its ritualis, we believe, are identical. The Candidate for its honours in England must be a Royal Arch Mason, and as such he presents himself at the Encampment-as the meetings are called—in the char - acter and garb of a pilgrim or palmer, as they were designated in the Holy Land; he figuratively undergoes seven years’ travel, and then seven years’ warfare, when, having conducted himself courgaeously through his .trials,"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"160 DIIGHT5 TEMPLAR DEGREE. he is finally admitted into the Order. It need hardly be said that it is entirely a Xtian Degree, and into it none but such as are professors of Xtianity can be admitted. There is not a vestige of Freemasonry as such in the degree, save the absolute necessity of Candidates having been admitted into the Royal Brch. The New Testa - is, except one slight extract, exclusively used for illustra - tion; and the three great lights represent Peter, James, and John.

It is generally supposed to have been instituted in Palestine by the Knights Templar in the 12th century, and one writer informs us that Prince Edward, afterwards Edward 1st, was there admitted into the Order. We also learn from Ragon, who wrote a work entitled “Orthodoxie Macon - nique,” that it owes its origin to a pious monk named John Valentine Andre*i, who lived in the early part of the 17th century. This Andrea, wrote two treatises, entitled “Judicorum de Fr~ternitate R.

The reason of it being designated Scottish Rite is, that it is supposed to have derived its first establishment from Scottish Madons. In Prussia, France, and Scotland the principal degrees of the Rite appeared in an organized form in 1718. Lord Derwent~ater and his associates were working in Lodges of Herodim in 1725 in Paris, when the Grand Lodge of England sent to France the Ancient York Constitutions. Many Scotch brethren, Jacobites, being in France at this time, were initiated in many of the higher degrees of this rite. Findel and others assert that the Rite took its origin about the year 1740, from Michael Andrew Ramsay, a Scotchman, commonly called “Chevalier Ramsay,” born at Ayr in 1686, and died in France 1748, and that from the time of the banishment of the Stuarts from England in 1688 secret alliances had been kept up between Rome and Scotland, Charles Stuart having retired in 1719 to Rome, that as these communications became more intimate, the hopes of the Pretender increased; that. Ramsey attempted to corrupt the loyalty and fealty of Freemasonry in the Grand Lodge of Scotland founded in 1786, and being unable to do so conceived the scheme of assembling and more fully banding together the faithful adherents of the banished royal family in the higher grades, and thus filling their private Coffers. Thory, in the Acta Latamorum, says that “Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, created the order of St. Andrew of Chardon, after the battle of Bannockburn; to this order was afterwards united that of Heredom, in order to anite the Scotch Masons who formed a part of his small army that defeated the English.

Dr.-Oliver informs us that this Order was after - ~vards confined to the two Degrees of Heredom and Rosycross. Bra. Chas. T. M~c. Clenachan, P.G.M., United States, in a work of his on the subject, says “the following is perhaps the most reliable and probable history of the origin of the degrees of the Ancient accepted Scottish Rite. At or about the period of the Masonic revival and excite - ment in the early part of the 18th century, there was felt a desire for a deeper research into the arcana of Free - masonry, and a thorough examination of the esoteric doctrines of the Order. The more ardent and brilliant minds of Europe determining to explore the Kabala, and enticed by so enobling a study, resolved to establish a superior grade of Masonry, for the exclusive propogation of the Mysteries as yet so little known to them, embracing the Historical, Philosophical, and Chrivairic. With this purpose in view, attempts were made to establish separate and distinct organizations, wherein the sublime truths might be revealed and cultivated.” Nearly all these projects were ephemeral, and were out - lived by their projectors, while the “Rite of Perfection,” the germ of the organization of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite—based upon the pure principles of Masonry and the elucidation of the occult mysteries, containing twenty-five degrees—gradually approached development. Doubtless the course of the Chivalier Ramsay, in 1740 hastened the consummation of the systematizing and em - bodying the degrees which had theretofore been for many years detached and unlocated.. Bro. J. Howe inform us that “The earliest j~ecord of the practice of any of the Degrees of this Rite is that of the Lodge of ~t. George de la Observance, No. 49, in Covent Garden, London, and working the ‘Sublime degrees.’ There i8 also proQf that ~oine of the degrees, the 18th,"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"192 THE IOSR CROIX DI HEREDOM DEGRRE. 28th, and Both, were practised in the Midland Counties, at ~Tottingham, in the last century, by some brethren who were descendants of the Ancient York Masons, under the authority of Lord Bancliffe, G.M. of the Templars.” Bro. Preston informs us “that in 1787 a Grand Chapter of Harodim was opened. Though of ancient date and. practised in different parts of Europe there is no record. prior to this of its establishment in England.” We are indebted also to Bro. J. Howe for the following remarks on the subject—” It is not the rule at present to practise any of the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Rite below the 18th Degree, but some were continued to be practised. up to a very recent period, and little over thirty years ago they were conferred on Brethren now living at the Crown Tavern, Clerkenwell Green.” We have been told that this association was a Council of the nine Excellent Masters, and thus might be analogous to the Supreme Council; but we are unable, to learn what degrees were conferred, for excepting as to the Ark Mariner or Noa - ebite and the Bose Croix, the survivors have no know - ledge.- When the Duke of Sussex came unto power he exerted all his influence to suppress the practices we have referred to. At the death of the Duke of Sussex it was thought desirable to assemble the .ecattered fragments of the ancient degrees, and by general consent of the remaining members of the Ancient Order to form a general governing body of the Ancient and Accepted Rites The present degrees of the Knight Templar and the Holy Arch not being found ~to exist amongst the ancient degrees of the Order; it seemed impossible to combine them ~n the rite, and thus it was thought better to establish an Independent Conclave for the degree of Knight Templar, by a general accordance of the various BxlBt3ng Encampments, a great Majority of which acceded"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE ROSE OXOIX D~ HEREDOM DEGREE. 198 thereto, and those with one exception have since joined. It was then that an interview took place between the leaders, and it having been satisfactorily ascertained that none of the existing Encampmeits ever had any authority by warrant from any legally constituted authority to give the Degrees of Rose Croix and Kadosh, they being Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, it was agreed to discontinue any assumption of authority over those Degrees on the part of the Grand Conclave, whilst the Supreme Council, on their part, discontinued amy authority or interference with the Templar Degree. Knight of the Eagle and Pelican is one of the titles applied to a Rose Croix H—R---D——M. Freemason; yet that Degree is not strictly an order of Knighthood in the commonly received sense of the term. The Novice is still in search of the Truth and the lost Word; he journeys for a period of years, learning the three virtues which are to guide him, from a place of horror and~ gloom to that place from which merges at the appointed time the sacred initials, giving glory to Masonry and light and life to the world. This -Degree is philosophical, the end of which is to free the mind from those encumbrances which hinder its progress towards perfection, and to raise it to-the contemplation of inimitable truth, and the knowledge of divine and spiritual objects.

The Emblems of.this Degree are the Eagle and Pelican, the Cross and the Rose. The Eagle is a symbol of Christ in his divine character, vide Deuteronomy xxxii. 11. The Pelican is an emblem of our Saviour shedding his blood for the salvation of human kind. The Cross, as with the Egyptians, is a symbol of ever - lasting life, but since our Saviour’s time on earth it has been adopted by all Christians as an emblem of Him who died for the redemption of the human race. The Rose is figuratively Christ, hence he is called “the Rose of Sharon.” Ragon says “that the Cross was in Egypt an emblem of immortality, and the rose of secrecy; the rose followed by the cross was the simplest mode of writing “the secret of immortality.” The Motto of this Degree is “Ne plus ultra.” Bro. Howe informs us—” In the original form of the Order of Knights Templar in this country it was the next step taken above the simpl~ Templar Degree, and was followed by that of the Kadosh. All Encampments being qualified to give those Degrees, the emblems of all are engraved on the certificates issued prior to 1851, and the seal conh.rms the grant. The ‘Ne plus ultra’ is at the top of the Masonic Ladder; the K.D.S.H. uniting the whole structure. But at the present day, so desirous is the Supreme Council to disavow the Knights Templar, that the Candidate for the Rose Croix is, at the time of receiving the Degree, allowed to wear .the Jewels of any Masonic rank he may have attained, except that of the Knights Templar. The Rose Croix Degree possesses similar characteristics to the Templar; the objects of both Degrees are the same; the Templar perhaps confining itse]f more to fact, while the Rose Croix displays more of the allegory; hence in the latter was afforded a better opportunity of interweaving the symbols of Craft Masonry with an emblem of the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"TEE ROSE CROIX DE REREDOM DEGREE. 195 Chris*tan faith. The older Masons are united in the opinion that these Degrees ought never to have been separated. The high consideration in which the Rose Croix is held is shown in the circumstance that its ritual has met with universal acceptance; the Symbolic Degrees are in all countries identical, so also is the Rose Croix— and this cannot be said of any other Degree. In Scotland the Rose Croix Degree is given under the Rite of the ‘Royal Order of Heredom and Rosy Cross,’ as well as under the sanction of the Supreme Council of the Thirty- third Degree. To be eligible there for this Order. the brother must be acknowledged as a Royal Arch Mason by the Grand Chapter of Scotland.” No satisfactory expla - nation can be found for the word “Heredom,” it appears by Ragon in his “Orthodoxie Maconnique” to have been invented by the Stuart party, and is a corruption of the Latin word h~redium, signifying “a piece of ground fallen by inheritance ;“ whereas Mackay says in an old M.S. of the Scotch Rites that Heroden is the name of a Mountain, situated in the N.E. of Scotland, at which place the first or Metropolitan lodge of Europe was held, and that the present orthography is the French method of spelling it. The Rose Croix Knight selects his name, taking, if possible, one not already assumed by any member of the Chapter; to ascertain which reference is had to the “Register of Characteristics,” which each Chapter must keep, and in which the Secretary registers the name and the characteristics of the Candidate as soon as he selects the latter. -If he desires to select a name which some other Knight already bears, an adjective should be added to distinguish him; as, if there be already a brother styled “Eques ft Sinceritate,” or “ab Excellentift,” the new Knight should be called “Eques ft Sinceritate verft, or “ab Excellentift eximift,” &c. “Eques ft (or “ab” when o2"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"196 TEE ROSE CROIX DE EEREDOM DEGREE. the noun that follows begins with a vowel) Toleratione,” &c.

There is but one infallible, unerring Judge. All human judgment is at best unqertain; serious in its consequences it must often, when time develops its errors, produce regret and sometimes remorse. It is not wise to seek to Judge our fellow man, it is a stern duty and an unwelcome task to be performed, and not a privilege to be coveted, and woe unto that man who assumes the prerogative of judgment, and to some extent usurps the functions of God, not being himself just, upright, and impartial.

In all my realm, justice and right were sold to none, denied to none, delayed to none. I slept little, I wrote much, I studied more. I reigned ~aly to bless those over whom I had dominion. I have vanished into the thin past, and many ages have marched insolemn procession by my grave, yet I still live in the memory of men. They call me great King, wise lawgiver, just judge, follow, then, my example, or shudder to sit in judgment on thy fellows. * S I was Socrates, the Athenian; I knew the holy mysteries, and reverenced God in nature. In the sacred groves of Athens I taught to young and old that God was one, and, the soul of man immortal. I taught obedience to the laws and degrees of the people of Athens 2 and the council of five hundred. When I sat in the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"250 T~ 8lsT DEGREE OF TEE A. AND A.

If thou wouldest fain become a judge of others first prepare thyself by learning to obey the laws. * I was Confucius, who read and interpreted to the people of ancient China the great laws engraved by the finger of God, in everlasting letters, upon the pages of the manj~ leaved book of nature. I said to them desire not for your country any other benefit than justice; the great law of duty is to be looked for in humanity. “Justice is Equity,” to render to every man that to which he is entitled. He who would stand above the ordinary level of man must be exempt from prejudices and self conceit and obstinacy, and be governed by the mandates of justice alone. Hear much, reflect much, and say nothing superfluous. Let doubt of guilt be acquitted; and presumption of innocence be solid proof. “That is the noblest recoin- pence of human virtue I Do thou strive so to live and act, to obey and govern, and thou too mayest live in the good opinion of men, after thou art dead, and thine influences may make the too a King over the mind8 of men. 0 S"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"TEE 81sT DEGREE OF THE A.

He who assumes to judge his brethren clothes himself with the prerogative of God “Woe unto thee” if, being thyself vicious or criminal, thou dost assume to judge others; and still more if thou givest corrupt judgement, for then wifl thy memory be execrated and in all time it shall be the bitterest reproach to an unjust judge to cafl him by thy name. * 3 * I was Zoroaster, whose words became law to the Persians. I said he is the best servant of God whose heart is upright, who is liberal with due regard to what is first to all men; who turns not his eyes towards riches and whose heart wishes well to ever~-fiiing that lives. He alone is just who is charitable and merciful in his judge - ments, and he alone is wise who thinks well and not evil of other men.

Behold! the monogram of the greatest lawgiver that has ever come among men, and listen reverentially to his teachings. “If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your tres - passes; but if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” With what judg - ment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. If thy Bro - ther trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy Brother. Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, for - give him, and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying “I repent” thou shalt forgive him. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. 0 * 0 You have heard the lessons of immortal wisdom once uttered by mortal lips that have long since mouldered into dust.
