The officer to whom it is issued must sign and send to the Secretary General a receipt for the same upon forms furnished for the purpose. Such officer will be held to personal re - sponsibility for this book as long as his receipt for it is outstanding. This Book of the Scottish Rite is the result of a joint under - taking by the United Supreme Councils of the Ancient and Ac - cepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry (Prince Hall Affiliation) for the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions of the United States of America. It is a revision of the official ritual from the 40 to the 320, inclusive, heretofore adopted and used by these respective Jurisdictions. This revision is the work of a Joint Committee repre - senting both Supreme Councils. The purpose is to place in the hands of those officers of the subordinate bodies charged with the responsibility of conferring these degrees, a work better adapted to present day requirements. This book is essentially an abridgment. Drastic innovations have been avoided, and no violence has been done to the philosophy or to the basic content of the degrees. Neither has ther~e been any fundamental departure from the traditions of the Ancient and Ac - cepted Scottish Rite. Allegories have been inLerpolated as addi - tional sections to certain degrees, the better to dramatize the lessons inculcated. The use of these interpolations, however, is optional. While strict adherence to this revised ritual will be obligatory in conferring the degrees, it is contemplated that the older work will continue to be a reference book to which recourse may be had for a fuller exploration of the degrees. A repetition here of certain official statements of the two Su - preme Councils concerned seems advisable: While the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite include the Entered Ap - prentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason; yet, in the United States, all authority over these degrees by Supreme Councils is waived, and they are exclusively administered by the Blue or Sym - bolic Lodges, working under the jurisdiction of Grand Lodges and the representative system. In some other countries, the first three degrees are given in Lodges of Perfection. The degrees conferred under the auspices and authority of these two Supreme Councils of the Prince Hall Affiliation begin with the Fourth Degree—Secret Master. Any regular and worthy Master Mason in good standing and having required residential qualifications is eligible to reception into the Scottish Rite series, beginning with that degree.

T. P.—My Brother, so humble a position well becomes every one who aspires to the rank of a Levite. Before honor is humility. This Temple which you have now entered represents the Solo - monic Temple, and this apartment the Holy place, separated by a wall of white marble from the Holy of Holies, with one door; for the duty of guarding which, you are to be set apart. You have already been taught, t[iat as a speculative Freemason you are to be built up as a living stone of a spiritual temple not made with hands: yea, that every renewed Freemason is himself a Temple, the foundation of which should be laid in humility and contrition o~ spirit; otherwise the Divine Presence will not dwell therein. The great light which will be exhibited to you in this degree, the full resplendency and mysterious mean[ng of wh[ch burst upon you when you arrive at perfection in Ancient Craft Masonry, is emblematical of that divine illumination which will shine in the Holy of Holies of your own soul. & Brother Adoniram, you will now raise the Brother from the level to the plumb. The Inspector raises the Brother by the Secret Master’s grip. 1?. P.—My Brother, on the level lies the whole system of man’s duty to his fellow man; but his duty to God rises in a perpendicular, which with the level forms the square. The level, too, is the api; emblem of Death, the great levelLer of mortals, while the plumb betokens the resurrection to life and immortality beyond the grave. 6f~ ~/ ~ Brother Master of Ceremonies 7 you will conduct the Brother to the brazen layer in the South, that he may wash; and you will sprinkle him~seven times with hyssop, dipped from the brazen layer, that he may be clean.

P.—Whoso draweth nigh to the contemplation of the Ineffable mysteries, let him put off the shoes of his worldly conversation and corrupt affection, for the place whereon he standeth is Holy ground. Before we approach the house of the Lord, let us seri - ously consider whether we have taken straight steps in the paths of his commandments, and whether our feet are set in due order and FOURTH DEGREE cleansed according to the purifications of the Sanctuary. Let us wash, as it were, in the layer of repentance~ Wash you and make you clean; put away the eviL of your doings; acknowledge your iniquities and return unto the Lord, for He will have mercy upon you, and our Elohim will abundantly pardon. Let us incite each other to practice virtue and shun vice. While our feet are prepared for walking in the ways of his commandments, our hands should in like manner be prepared for working in his service. My Brother, you have hitherLo seen only the thick veil which hides from your view the Sanctum Sanctorum of God’s Holy Temple. Your fidelity, zeal, and constancy have won for you the favor you are now about to receive, of viewing some of our treasures and gaining admission into the Secret or Holy place. Before this can be done, it will be necessary for you to take an obligation to be faithful even unto deaLh. Brother Adoniram, you will cause the Candidate to recede to the West and advance by seven steps to the altar. ~ 1.—Brother Master of Ceremonies, let the Candidate recede to the West by seven steps.

Chant—O Lord! have mercy upon us; for Thy goodness en - dureth forever. T. P.—My Brother, in this degree, you see before you as in the preceding degrees, the three great lights of symbolic Masonry. The book of the testimony, the square and the compasses, and in addi - tion a fourth great light, which belongs not to symbolic Masonry, 41 11 ‘I ‘4 4/- 1 ‘4 FOURTH DEGREE 17 ‘‘the Triangle.’’ The first three degrees are called symbolic, be - cause they symbolize the higher mysteries, and not, as is generally supposed, because they deal in signs and symbols exclusively; for signs, symbols, and allegories are peculiar to all Masonic degrees. This triangle, witb us, Ineffable Masons, is deemed a great light, because by its historical and mystical association, it reminds us of the Grand Architect of tbe Universe, to whom we are all bound to render our devotions and whose will it is ours to obey. It reminds us continually of the only one true God; and its three sides or angles, that He is our Creator, Preserver and Benefactor; and of his tlu’ee attributes, Wisdom, Strength and Beauty; also of the primitive instruments used by Him to produce order out of chaos 4 fire, light and spirit, and finally of those lovely Masonic attributes, Faith, Hope, and Charity. -- My Brother, you may now arise and approach the East, where I will instruct you as to the object and purpose of Ineffable Masonry. The Master of Ceremonies conducts the Candidate to the Thrice Potent. T. P.—The degrees upon which you are now entering are called • Ineffable, because they treat of the Ineffable Name of Jehovah, and of his Ineffable Essence, of which the inscription on the golden triangle is emblematical. Each degree has for its sacred word one of the substitute names of the Deity, expressive of his attributes. We have beside these the true name, the correct pronunciation of which will be given to you when you arrive at the Perfection of Ancient Craft Masonry, in the sublime and mysterious degree called Grand -Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason. O~e of the principal secrets of primitive Freemasonry was a knowledge of the true God, his character and attributes. By the medium of names we obtain a knowledge of persons and things. Jehovah, therefore, in suiting Himself to our capacity, hath com - municated a knowledge of Himself and his gracious purposes toward his people, by a great variety of names. These, therefore, are descriptive, not arbitrary; they have sense as well as sound. Re - specting the Grand Architect of the Universe, his name is Himself and Himself is his name. Through the poverty of human language we are wont to distinguish between God and his attributes. But God and his attributes are one. We speak of his wisdom, justice, and love. But God is not only endowed with all these perfections, He is the embodiment of them. The defect of our intellect in"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"18 FOURTH DEGREE comprehending Him is like the weakness of our sight in beholding the sun. The names of God were intended to communicate a knowl - edge of Himself. By these, we are enabled to acquire some scanty ideas of his essential majesty, goodness and power, and to know in whom we are to believe, and what we are to believe of Him. 0 Jehovah our Adonai, how excellent is thy name over all the earth. —‘~=~- My Brother, I will now instruct you in the sign, grip, word, etc., of this degree. . . . ‘e~ The peculiar lesson taught in this degree, my Brother, is Secrecy and Silence. God is frequently worshipped in silence. All things at the creation took their beginning from silence. Pythagoras com - pelled his disciples to pass through a probation of two or three~ years to thoroughly incu] cate this lesson. From man we learn to speak, from God to be silent. () The word Ziz, or Zizon, is sometimes rendered Balustrade, or entrance into the Sanctum Sanctorum. It also alludes to the threshold or entrance into ~he Ineffable degrees and mysteries to which we welcome you with a Brother ‘s welcome, charge and in - vestiture. 7~ ~ 9r~’ 6 ~ INVESTITURE Permit me now, my Brother, to receive you as a Secret Master, and give you rank among the Levites. rPlaces a wreath of laurel and olive on the Candidate’s head.] I crown you with a wreath of laurel and olive. The laurel, an emblem of victory, is to remind you of the con - q~uest you ought to gain over your passions; the olive, a symbol of peace, which should ever reign among us. With Wisdom, Strength, Prudence and Fortitude, may you soon obtain the favor of an entrance into the secret vault. It will be your own fault if you are not found worthy, and do not in due time arrive at the sacred place, where rapt in divine joy you may contemplate the pillar of Beauty. I decorate you, my Brother, with an ivory key, suspended from a white and black ribbon, an emblem of fidelity, innocence, and pru - dence. On the key you behold a symbol which teaches you to keep a tongue of good report; and it is also an emblem of silence, and refers to the silence which distinguishes a Secret Master.

There is no number of thy days or of thy mercies. Thou has sent us into this world to serve Thee, but we wander far from Thee in the path of error. Our life is but a span in length, and yet tedious, because of the calamities that enclose us on every side. The days of our pilgrimage are few and evil; our bodies frail; our passions violent and distempered; our under - standing weak, and our wills perverse. Look Thou upon us, our Father, in mercy and pity. We adore thy majesty, and trust like little children to thine infinite mercies. Give us patience to live well, and firmness to resist evil, even as our departed Brothcr re - sisted. Give us, 0 .most merciful Father, faith and confidence in Thee, and enable us so to live, that when we come to die we may lie down in the grave like one who composes himself to sleep, and that we may be worthy hereafter to be remembered in the memories of man. Bless us, 0 God: bless our beloved fraternity throughout the world; may we live and emulate the example of our departed Brother; and finally, that we may in this world attain a know 1- edge of thy truth, and in the world to come, life everlasting.

The Captain ol! the Guard forms the procession in the North, double file,’ and facing the East, the torches preceding, borne by Brethren. After the formation: LESSON R. W.—My Brethren, in the preceding degrees of Masonry, our travels were to remind us of the journey of human life, in which Freemasonry is an enlightened and beautiful path. Our present march will be gloomy and funereal. Our Grand Master is no more. Death is among us; our Lodge is in mourning, and the great calam - ity has fallen upon -us. Death reigns in all portions of’ our time. Al?~’the succession of time; all the changes of nature; all the varie - ties of light and darkness, and every contingency to every man and to every creature doth preach~ our funeral ~ermon, and call us to look and see how Time is ever preparing the grave where we must lay our sins and our sorrows. Death regards not those ~weet engagements and pleasing inter- courses, and those improving joys which are known to Freemasons. Death summons away, in the midst of his day and usefulness, many a beloved Brother of our craft. We behold his sun at meridian and rejoice at its brightness, but alas! it soon sets and the evening shades of existence close around him forever. Let us, then, imitate the example of our illustrious Grand Master Hiram Abiff, and by a wise and virtuous life, make preparation for a peaceful death. The procession will now move three times around the Lodge. On the second time around, the four Brdthers selected for that purpose will take up the coffin and bear it with the procession. After the third time the procession proceeds to the tomb and the coffin is deposi Led before it. During all this time the Right Worshipful follows the procession, and says: R. W.—Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; while the sun, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because - they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low: Also, when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree sh~]l flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his long home, and mourners go about the streets; or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. 7~ 6 On arriving at the tomb, the Brethren divide in two parallel lines, and the Right Worshipful Master and Inspector pass between them and stand at the foot of the coffin, facing the Brethren. The Brethren drop sprigs of acacia on the coffin, which is placed in the tomb. R. W.—Farewell, my Brother! Blessed be his rest, fragrant the acacia upon the hallowed sod that covers him. Brethren, we have performed the last sad duties to our friend and Brother. We have closed his eyes and deposited his body in the silent tomb. Let us now return to our Lodge, and not remain 4, in idleness while the assassins of our Brother are at large. All return to the Lodge, and the Right Worshipful places himself behind the altar, the Candidate before him. R.

The Captain of the Guard appoints him Lieutenant, and instructs him that the Guard is composed of Secret Masters; places him very near the door, and commences preparing him and arming him as his Lieutenant. Presently King Hiram rushes through the Guards, in an excited manner, and enters the Lodge, apparently in a great passion, leaving the door partly open. C. of G.—[To Candidate.] That was very abrupt.

K. of T.—Then call me not Brother; they are not such as thou hast promised me. Thou hast not kept thy faith. My servants did cut thee down as many trees out of Libanus as thou didst want, and conveyed them on rafts by sea to Joppa; cedars and fir-trees, and pine trees from Libanus; providing timbers in abundance for the houses which thou didst desire to build; and I sent thee Hiram, my dear Brother, a wise and skillful man, to devise the work for thy house. He hath lost his life in thy service. Then was there peace between us, and we made a league together, notwithstanding my God was not thy God—because we were Brothers in the Sacred Mysteries—and thou didst promise to give me twenty cities for the services rendered thee. K. 8.—My Brother, even as I promised, so have I done. Did II not give thee twenty cities in the land of Galilee? How have I not - kept my faith with thee? K. of T.—Solomon, God—even thy God—hath given thee wis - dom and understanding exceeding much. Thou art wiser than all men, and thy renown hath gone unto all the nations around about.

Ah, king! he is not wise who is not honest, or who doth not keep his word in spirit as well as in letter. Are not all Perfect Masters taught to let their admiration or denial be the understanding of their contractor? K. 8.—How, my Brother, have I failed to keep my word in spirit as well as in letter? How hath the measure of my affirmation or denial not been your understanding of my promise? K. of T.—Thou didst promise me twenty cities. I looked not to ‘I 44 I U SIXTH DEGREE 33 receive so many ruined and deserted villages, surrounded by wilder - ness, but twenty populous and flourishing places, bordered by smil - ing fields and fruitful meadows.

Retain them, and henceforth let the league between us cease. K. 8.—Be pacified, and hear me patiently, my Brother. It was my intention— - King of Tyre turns around and sees the Candidate; rushes to the door and seizes him. K. of T.—Ha! another evidence of your traitorous conduct—a listener!

King of Tyre seizing a sword from the table and drawing back, as if to cut the Candidate from the left shoulder to the right hip. K. of T.—Let him suffer the punishment his baseness deserves. King Solomon lays his hand on Hiram’s sword-arm and stays the act, saying: K. 8.—For a moment stay thy hand, my Brother. Jehovah hath said, “Thou shalt not kill, for whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God w~s man created.” Guards, without there! Guards hastily enter. Thou shouldet not dishonor thyself, my Brother, by becoming the executioner. Let Joabert be tried and heard in his defense, and if condemned, he shall be duly punished.

K. of T.—Joabert? K. S.—Even so. I regret that my favorite should have been de - tected in the act of eavesdropping, or listening at the door, while we were engaged in a private conversation.

For this, and that there is some palliating circumstances, I will be a guarantee, and offer myself for a surety.

I can scarcely believe that ba~enes~ and impertinent curiosity could have actuated you, and, at my inter - cession, he has consented to hear you in your defense, and to for - give you if there be anything that can excuse or explain your con - duct. C. of G.—Thrice Ifltistrioi~s Kings Solomon and Hiram, by your permission, I can bear witness that Joabert’s conduct was not in - duced by a vain curiosity to pry into secrets, or an unlawful desire to obtain the knowledge of things forbidden.

I have assured my worthy ally, that, among all the favorites and lords of my court, Joabert has always evinced the warmest attachment to my person; that I knew him sufficiently well to be convinced that the indiscre - tion of which he has been guilty is not attributable to a desire of gratifying idle curiosity, but to watch over my safety and intcr - ests.

Again have you assumed the place and position of our lamented Grand Master Hiram Abiff and so become still more strongly bound to practice the virtues by which he was so eminently distinguished. My Brother, I will now instruct you in the sign, grip, word, etc., of this degree. J~~J§) 4~ //~ b-~ ~--~-~ INVESTITURE I will now proceed to invest you with the insignia of this degree. The color of your ribbon and apron is intended to remind you of the blood of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff, the last drop of which he was ready to shed sooner than prove a traitor to his trust. May you be equally faithful to your engagement, but now con - tracted. Your jewel—a solid triangle—is emblematical of law and jus - t~e, truth and peace, without which no compact can exist; also of the wisdom, strength and beauty which should characterize all alliances; and of the three virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity, or Love; of the mystery contained in Berith, Nadir, and 8helemoth— hence the letters A. P. P., respectively, in the three angles, being the initials of Alliance, Promise, and Perfection. It is also said to be emblem~tieal of those Masons who were present at the open - ing of the first Lodge of Intimate Secretaries—King Solomon, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Joabert, whom you have represented. It has many allusions, with which a knowledge of our Cabala will make you acquainted. SIXTH DEGREE 37 I also present you with a sword of defence against any attacks which may be made on your integrity and honor as a Mason. As a Confidential Secretary, you are intrusted with an especial con - fidence, and as a full proof of it, we accept you as our Intimate Secretary and a witness to our new alliance. In this degree, my Brother, you are taught to be zealous and faithful, to be disinterested and benevolent, to act the peacemaker in ease of disputes and quarrels among your brethren—and to be - ware of eavesdropping.

P.—[Re presenting King Solomon.] Reverend Brother Zadoc, counsel and advise with me. How shall we repair the loss which we have sustained by the murder of our worthy Grand Master Hiram? You know that to him was assigned the dLlty of decorating the secret chamber, where our most sacred treasures are deposited— that sacred and most Holy Place, where the Ark of God is to be kept, and his protection and presence to be sought. Scarcely had our most illustrious Brother set about this most important task, when he was suddenly removed from us; and upon no one has his mantle fallen; for he studied architecture in Baby - lon, in Thebes, in Memphis, and in Tyre; all that the builders in Rho~nicia, Egypt, and Assyria could teach, he knew. I am at a loss to provide for carrying on the work of the Temple, which stands still. S. W.—Thrice Potent King Solomon, cannot our Brother, the King of Tyre, send another architect to fill the place of our deceased Grand Master? 12. P—He has none such in his dominions, and where shall we find one like unto him that we have lost? S. W.—Thrice Potent, I deeply sympathize with you in the loss of our Grand Master, and am convinced of the difficulty of repair - ing it. I have reflected much on this matter; the only remedy which in EIGHTH DEGREE 47 my opinion promises any success, would be to select from the chief architects five of the most worthy and expert, upon whom you may confer the rank of Intendants of the Building, and with their aid and skill complete the Secret Chamber and other unfinished parts of the Temple. You know how fond oar lamented Grand Master was of the society of the yoang, and how he delighted to communicate to them the arts and sciences which he had studied in the East and in Egypt. His chief favorites were Adoniram, the son of Abda; Joabert, the noble Ph~nician; Stolkin, of the tribe of Benjamin; Selec, the Giblemite; and Gareb, of the tribe of Naphtali—whom he was wont to term his school, and whom he well instructed in the art of working in brass, in wood, and in silver and gold. He often spoke to me of these scholars, saying, that, if he were taken away, they would be able to fill his place; he often intrusted to Adoniram the superintendence of the whole work, and made Joabert the chief artificer in brass; Stolkin, chief of the workers in wood; Selec, chief of the stone-masons; and Gareb, chief of the workmen in silver and gold, and the engravers. Why should they not, if it so please the King, take his place, as he intended, now that he is dead? 12. P.—Brother Ahishar, as governor of my house, you should be somewhat conversant with the competency of these pupils of our deceased Grand Master to fill his place and carry on the work upon the Temple; how do you adjudge them? J. W.—Thrice Potent, they were greatly trusted by the Grand Master, and he believed them fitted to succeed him. They may, at least, conduct the work until one can be found fitted in all respects to be appointed Grand Master Architect. They will partly supply the great loss we have sustained, if they can do no more. 12. P.—Have they attained the rank of Provost and Judge? J. W.—They have, and ever proved themselves, as Judges, just and impartial. T. P.—Brother Wardens, your counsels are approved. If pres. ent, let Adoniram, Joabert, Stolkin, Selec and Gareb, arise.

W.—My Brethren, this step of the degree of the Intendant of the Building is intended to symbolize your fulfillment of the promise to recede from everything that is vicious in your nature, and to strive and study how you may best advance to virtue. My Brethren, in order that a Provost and Judge may be quali - fled for the office of Intendant of the Building, it will be necessary for him to take a solemn obligation in the same position in which h-e whom he represents as an architect lies in the grave; for we should be dead to sin and vice, that we may arise to virtue. The Candidat6, heing prostrate on his back, is covered with a crimson cloth. In his right hand is placed a sprig of acacia, and in his left, the Book of the Testimony. S.

[also decorate you with this triangular Apron, of white, lined with crimson and bordered with green; on it you will observe the five-pointed star which shines in the East, with the Hebrew letter (Yod) thrice repeated, in the center, which is to remind you of the threefold essence of the Deity and of the three sacred words of this degree. Over the star is the equipoised balance of Justice; on the flap of the apron you will observe, as on the jewel, the Hebrew letters B, A, J—one on each angle of the triangle—having refer - ence to Ben-khurim, A char, and Jakinah. 4F-F-- 4-F-’ I 2’F-’ r 44” F’ I ~- 2~9 ~ ( ~ ‘44 —F F F ii 4’ / 441"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"44~44 44-’ B 52 EIGUTH DEGREE >f / The number Five, in this degree, my Brother, has many illusions, some of which have already been ezplained to you; it is also to re - mind us of the five points of fellowship; that we are to go on a Brother’s errand or to his relief even barefoot and upon flinty ground; to remember him in your supplications to the Deity; to clasp him to your heart and protect him against misfortune and slander; to uphold him when about to stumble and fall; and to give prudent, honest, and friendly counsel.

P.—Stranger, speak freely. What have you to communicate? M. of 0.—Sovereign Master, I have ventured to solicit t[ie honor of this interview, t[lat I may inform you that my herds feed on the mountains east of Joppa; while searching for one that had strayed, I penetrated into the deepest recesses of the hills. I found in a narrow valley the slain carcass of the animal I sought; and, following the trace of him who killed it, I came upon a cavern in the steep side of the mountain, and hiding myself near it, among the rocks, I saw at nightfall three persons enter, coming from the valley, answering to the description of the assassins of Hiram the Builder; then I crept near, and listening learned that they were the murderers of whom your officers had been in search. Then, cautiously withdrawing, I came hither with all speed, to give in - formation, and also to offer you my services to guide to the cave those whom you may select for that purpose. 1?. P.—You have done well, my friend, and this favor shall not go unrewarded. Masters and Brethren, you have heard the in - formation given by the Shepherd. We commemorated the memory of our lamented Grand Master by the ei~ection of a monument, thus testifying our love fot’ his virtues and our desire that his name should be forever honored by the craft~. While it is well that xv e thus express our sorrow at his loss, and our desire to emulate his virtues, we must not forget that we have a sterner duty to perform dictated to us by the de - mands of justice, and which. tells us that we have not done our whole duty until we have avenged his memory, by inflicting upon his murderers that punishment w[lich their most heinous crime so richly merits. ¾> - U V ‘I V V"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"55 NINTH DEGREE This day, my Brethren, we are particularly favored, by having given to us the means of capturing them. The Shepherd informs us of the exact place of concealment of the ruffians whom we have desired to find, and he volunteers to guide those of you whom I may select to that spot. It will doubtless be no unpleasant duty for you, my Brethren, to go upon this most righteous errand. I will therefore send those who may volunteer to accompany the guide. Those desirous of doing so may now rise. All rise. I am exceedingly gratified at this new proof of your zeal, but it will be impossible to send so large a number. It will be necessary to select a few, that all may have an opportunity for this honor. The Captain of the Guard will permit the brethren to draw ballots from an urn, and those who shall obtain the black ballots shall be the chosen few, not exceeding nine brethren, who will be guided to the cavern where the assassins are secreted. Let not the law and justice be defrauded of their due; but, taking the assassins alive, bring them hither to be tried and punished according to their deserts. If you succeed, you shall receive new honors, and your names as the Nine Elect shall be magnified in Israel. The urn has two apartments, in one of which are placed the white ballots and in the other all black.

After passing through the ante-room, the Master of Cerhinonies hurries the Candidate up and over the rough and rugged road; the rest lag behind; they then come to a place representing a cave, in which is a Brother lying down as if asleep, and near his feet a dagger; suspended is a single dim light; also a spring of water, and a cup near to drink from. While the Brethren are in the cave, the other Brethren and officers resume their places in the Chapter room. When they arrive at this cave, the Master of Ceremonies will give the Candidate the sign of silence, and say: ‘‘It is Akirop, one of the assassins; he sleeps; let us take advantage of this to avenge our Grand Master.” The Master of Ceremonies then seizes the dagger and strikes him in the head and heart; he takes the false head, which lies concealed by the Brother, and makes the Candidate take the dagger in his right hand and the head in the left; he then causes the Candidate to drink from the spring, giving him water in the cup.

Joabert has deprived us of the opportunity of avenging the death of Hiram Abiff by his rash act of disobedience, and he shall bear the penalty which he has prevented us from inflicting upon Akirop. 1.—Thrice Potent, Joabert has been well known as a zealous craftsman, and it is to his activity and zeal that we owe the dis - covery of Akirop.

HISTORY / Orator—After the death of the Grand Master Hiram Abiff, the a three assassins having made their escape, a great assembly of Masons was convened by King Solomon to consult as to the best means of discovering and apprehending them. Their deliberations were inter - rupted by the entrance of a herdsman, who demanded to speak to the King. On being admitted to an inLervieW, he acquainted King Solomon that he had discovered three persons concealed in a cave near the coast of Joppa answering the description given of the traitors, and he offered to conduct those whom the King should select to the place of their concealment. This being communicated to the Masters, they one and all eagerly requested to be made par - ticipators in the vengeance due the assassin. Solomon checked their ardor, declaring that only nine should undertake the task; and to avoid giving any offense, ordered a selection of nine of the brethren by lot to accompany the stranger. At the first hour of the night Joabert, Stolkin, and seven others, conducted by the stranger, ~rave1ed onward through a rough and dreary country towards the coast of Joppa. On the way, Joabert, [earning that the murderers were hidden in a cavern not far from where they then were, pressed Qn ahead, found the cavern, and entered it with the shepherd, where, by the dim light of the lamp, he discovered Akirop asleep, with a dagger at his feet. Inflamed at the sight, and actuated by an impatient zeal, he immediately seized the dagger and stabbed him first in the head and then in the heart. Akirop had only time to say, “Necum” or “vengeance is taken,” and expired. Joabert then quenched his thirst at the fountain. When the eight arrived at the spot, they asked Joabert what he had done; he replied, “I have slain Akirop, the assassin of our Grand M8ster, and have performed a feat for the honor and glory of the craft, for which I hope to be rewarded.” Joabert severed the head from the body, ~> and taking it in one hand and his dagger in tlie other, he witli the eight returned to Jerusalem.

In digging for a foundation for the teI~CpIe, at the spot first selected for that purpose, we found the ruins of an ancient ediace, which we sup - posed to have been built before the Flood, and devoted to idolatrous purposes.

T. P.—We thank you for your zeal and devotion. Relate to us your adventures in the arches and your discoveries. M. of C.—We again repaired to the ruins. My Companions fastened the rope around my body, and, with a lighted torch in my hand, I descended, and passed with much difficulty the seventh and eighth, and into the ninth and deepest arch of the cavern, when some rubbish falling from above extinguished the light, and left me in total darkness. Soon afterward, the place became illu - minated, and I discovered on one side of the arch a brilliant light. On approaching it, I found it proceeded from a triangular plate of gold, incrusted with precious stones, the brilliancy of which struck me with admiration and astonishment. I hastily gave the necessary signal, and was again drawn up to the surface of the earth to my companions. On relating to them what I had discovered and the scene I had witnessed, they immediately descended with me by the aid of a ladder of ropes to the ninth and deepest arch. The beauty and brilliancy of the plate filled us with awe and aston - ishment, and caused us to fall on our knees, and raise our eyes and hands to heaven in admiration. We took the plate from the pedestal on which it was fastened, and ascended to the earth, and have brought the same up for your inspection; and, as a reward for our toil and labor, would solicit to be made acquainted with the ancient characters on the cubic stone, and the mysterious char - acters on this golden plate, which we now present to you. They present the plate. On seeing the face o~ the plate of gold, the two Kings start up in surprise and admiration (giving sign). Hiram of Tyre being about to speak, King Solomon gives him the sign of silence; when he says, “Gibulum Ishtore,” or “Gibulum is a good man.” They then view the plate for some time in silence, and cover it up on the altar. 7. P.—My Brothers, your request shall in due time be complied with. You have had the honor and the exalted privilege of having discovered the dearest and most precious jewel of Masonry. The promise which God made to the Ancient Patriarchs, that in the fullness of time his true name should be revealed, is now accom - plished. By you that great and awful name has ‘been brought to light; until this time we were igno rant of the true pronunciation of that THIRTEENTH DEGREE 101 great name. The inscription on this cubic stone is in the ancient Enochian character, and reads, “Hanock Hawnah lai-ho -yah”; which, translated, means “Dedicated to God by Enoch”; a full ex - planation of which will be given to you in the history of the degree. As a reward, my Brothers, for the very valuable services you have rendered, we will constitute and create you Knights of the Ninth or Royal Arch; and we promise you an explanation of the mys - terious characters on this golden plate when it shall have been fixed in the place long designed for it. You will then receive the sublime and mysterious degree of Perfection. In the meantime travel, my Brothers, for further instruction, and in search of the true word; the giver of every good and perfect gift may further confirm the great favor vouchsafed to you and all of us in this day’s glorious result. The Master of Ceremonies and Candidates again travel, but without work - ing implements, until they approach the Burning Bush in the rear of the East, when the Master of Ceremonies says: M. of C.—We now approach the place representing the spot where Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his Father-in-law, the Priest of Midian; as he led the flock to the rear of the dese~t, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and beheld the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed; and Moses turned aside to see why the bush was not burned; and God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, “Draw not nigh hither, put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground; for I am the God of thy Father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’~; and Moses hid his face thus: Remove the shoes and make the second sign of Perfection. For he was afraid to look upon God; and God commanded Moses to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt; and Moses said, “Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, who shall I say sent me unto them?” and God said unto Moses, “I am that I am; thou shalt say, I am hath sent me unto you; I am the Lord, God Almighty; by my name Jehovah I am not known to them; I am that I am; and was and ever shall be”; and Moses did as the Lord commanded him.

He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil with his neighbor; but honoreth them that fear the Lord. 7’. P.—Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in his holy place? S. W.—He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive blessings from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. J.

Arc you fully satisfied, and wilhng that he be exalted to our highest mysteries, and receive the Sublime and Mysterious degree of Perfection? If so, give the mgn of assent. This part of the ceremony should be very solemn and impressive. It should not be considered a mere ceremony, but a matter of serious fact. Objections to the Candidate should be made by a member openly, or by the sign of dissent. TEE INQUIRY ft. P.—M~ Brother, a further test of your worthiness is required. Before you can proceed, it will be necessary for you to answer a few questions. I pray you to give each of thcm your candid con - sideration, and answer, as in the presence of God. If these ques - tions are favorably answered, the Brother may be induced to with - draw his objections. These objections may be read from a paper, that the Candidate may deem they are written for him in particular. Have you ever willfully revealed any of the secrets of Free - masonry? Candidate answers. Have you always, as far as lay in your power, been charitable to your Brethren? Candidate answers. Have you ever defrauded a Brother Mason? Candidate answers. Are you in the habit of using the name of God profanely, and of willfully violating any of his commandments? Candidate answers. Does your conscience accuse you of any offence against your Brethren which ought to debar you from receiving this degree? Candidate answers. Have you always been mindful of the obligations you have con - tracted in the presence of the Grand Architect of the Universe? Candidate answers.

P.—Brother Senior Warden, you will have the Brother con - ducted to the brazen layer in the South, that, as a token of his purity and innocence, he may wash and be clean; so that, pure and unspotted, he may be fitted to appear in the presence of the Lord, and also as a token of the purity of his intentions. Our fathers used this same ceremony of ablution when they were ac - cused of crime, in order to prove their innocence. S.

The Master of Ceremonies conducts the Candidate aro d the Lodge room to the brazen layer and directs him to wash and wipe his h ds. At the con - elusion the Commandments are read. And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord t y Go&, which have brought thee out~f the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any like - ness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the chil - dren, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor,~and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sab - bath day, and hallowed it. Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God hath given thee. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. FOURTEENTH DEGREE 119 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man servant, nor his maid servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor’s. My Brethren, Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons, do you now consent that this, our Brother, be admitted among us, and re - ceive our highest mysteries? If so, give the sign of assent. [Given.] My Brother, remember that if you now approach our most sacred and solemn mysteries with coldness and indifference, not mindful of your obligation, you will have more to answer for in the great and awful day, when the se.rets of all hearts are made known.

May our loins be girt about with the girdle of truth, and finally, having been faithful in all our course, may we be brought to behold the light ineffable, and ad - mitted into that sacred place where the sun shall no more give light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light, but the Lord, our Adonai, shall be with us an everlasting light, and our God our glory. Bless us, and bless the work in which we are engaged; and may the alliance we are about to perfect, be eternal. Amen! So mote it be! THE ANOINTING 1’. P.—I will now, my Brother, proceed to anoint you with the holy oil wherewith the pious Aaron, the penitent David, and the wise Solomon were anointed; and impress you with an ardent zeal for the honor and glory of the Grand Architect of the Universe, to the end that you may always live in his adorable presence, with a head disposed to contrive, a heart to feel, and a hand to execute al] those things toward him and your fellow creatures, which are so well pleasing in his sight. - Anointing eyes, lips and heart with oil. “Behold hon good and pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell to - gether in unity.

The Candidate rises. Here a bursting forth of lightning and thunder should transpire, and the lights be suddenly dim, and the room be filled as with a cloud; the organ suddenly peals forth a solemn strain, with trumpets, and a voice be heard, saying or smging:—’’Praise the Lord, for He is good, for his mercy endureth forever.’’ AROBA ~ND TIE RING You will now, my Brother, partake with me, and these Brethren about you assembled, of the ancient aroba, a pledge or covenant of friendship, by eating or drinking together. In the ancient covenant sacrifices, there was a division made of the parts, and the persons entering the alliance were to eat of those parts, as an agreement of their mutual league of friendship. In like manner, and for like purposes, I now divide this. Eat of the same with me and these Brethren, and drink also of the same cup, that we may learn thereby to succor each other in time of need, by the mutua] participation in what we possess. The Thrice Potent breaks the bread in two parts, and gives the King of Tyre one portion; the Brethren pass between them from the right, each one taking a piece as he passes, and resuming his station; destroy what is left. The wine is passed to each Brother to the right, all drinking; then, still stand - ing in a circle, the Thrice Potent presenting the ring says: —a — T. P.—My dear Brother, receive this pure gold ring, and let it be worn by you as a symbol of the alliance you have contracted with virtue and the virtuous; the inscription on the ring is, Vi’rtus junxit Mo’rs non separ=Thit—(”Whom virtue unites death cannot separate”) ; th&ring itsel> is an emblem of eternity, and, with the FOURTEENTH DEGREE All resume their eats, except Candidate and Master of Ceremonies. 7’. P.—+ My Brother, that -which I shall now communicate to you, I trust, will make you accomplished in Ancient Craft Masonry; the sign, token, password, covered word and Grand Ineffable word of a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason. -a There are three signs, three tokens, three passwords, three cov - ered words, and one Grand Ineffable Word to this degree. Here the Candidate is instructed in the signs, words, grips, etc., from 1 to 13, and the T. P. may dilate on the secrets and mysteries. T. P.—Brother Master of Ceremonies, you will now communicate to the Candidate the signs, tokens, passwords and covered words of a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason. The Master of Ceremonies co minunicates the three signs, three tokens, three passwords, to the Candidate (low music) and then conducts him to the Senior Warden. (Music stops.) ---SF’— 123 ‘a - nscription, symboliz~ the etei~nal nature of virtue, with which you / are now irrevocably alhed”and in covenant. - You are never to par~\\vith it, my Brother, while you have life, - nor at your death, ex=ept t’b leave it to your eldest son, your wife, - or your dearest friei<d. \\ -Si ‘a Ia, I - a,’ a:, S. W.—The Ineffable Tetragrammaton, or four-letter name, which it is not [awful for man to speak, except in a peculiar man - ner, will in due time be communicated to you. You have been made acquainted with the fact that the true name of God was revealed to Enoch, and that he engraved that name upon a triangular plate of pure gold, and deposited it in the bowels of the earth; that name is called the Tetragrammaton, or holy four - letter name; the characters used by Enoch, and which have been explained to you in the preceding degree, differ materially from ~ the Hebrew not only in the form of the letters, but in that each had different powers. The ineffable name of God, in different ages of the world, re - ceived different pronunciations, and varied with the country and language of the speaker. Its pronunciation underwent many changes, which are called Ages of Masonry. They are 3, 5, 7, and 9—the mysterious numbers a - hf this degree. You will now, niy brother, be permitted to pronounce that great 45 F — I — 4’- -l - ‘at -‘a -SI -j 7 / I: 4 £1 /5 ‘a- I 1- I’"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"124 FOURTEENTH DEGREE and solemn name—the grand, mysterio-us word of a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason—which, from the day~ of Enoch to the present time, has ever been deemed unlawful for man to speak. [The word is communicated by the Senior and Junior Wardens.] You will now, my Brother, speak the word: this word defines the essence of God: his existence, his unity, his goodness, his pro-vi - dence, and his eternity. _ The lights, prior to this, having been gradually dimmed, as the C. pronounces the word, lightning and thunder burst forth; the organ and tr~mpets are also heard; the cloth covering the luminous pedestal and cube of agate is removed; the Brethren make the second sign, and chant ‘‘Praise the Lord for he is good; for his mercy endureth forever.” The Master of Ceremonies conducts the Candidate around the room to the ~YoA~t. 77=~7~ ~- g a-a z’-~- / ‘~a ,-a~/a /‘7a4’a-’j”’ INVESTITURE T. P.—I shall now, my Brother, invest you with the apron, girdle, collar and jewel of a Grand Elect, IPerfect and Sublime Mason; and with the greatest pleasure salute you with the title, and grace you with the symbols thereof. The collar is emblematical of ardent zeal, affection and charity. The crown upon jewel is a symbol of the Royal origin of the degree. The compass, extended to ninety degrees, denotes the extensive knowledge of the Grand Elect. The sun, in the center, that our actions should be as open as the full blaze of the noon-day sun, and our charity as diffusive as its beams. This jewel, suspended upon your breast, should make you attentive to your duties, and cause you to walk so as to adorn your station. The apron, my Brother, which you wear, is white, lined with w1~ite, and bordered with gold. The white is to remind us of inno - cence, and of that purity which was required for an entrance to this place; the gold, of wisdom, which should characterize all Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons. Its form is supposed to be the true form used by the Perfect Master Mason at the building of the Temple, and alludes to the golden triangle or delta of Enoch, which adorns the center. The girdle with which I also invest you, is the ancient girdle of a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason. It was used of old to bind up and strengthen the body, and enable man to persist in his labors: it is, therefore, an emblem of activity, promptness and perseverance. 5 ‘-‘a -i -5-- 41 ~a a-. a’ 5-a. I FOURTEENTH DEGREE 125 The colors are arranged according to the mystic numbers of this degree—3, 5, 7 and 9, and are thus explained: The three are blue, red, and yellow, by the due mixture of which the primitive colors are all formed. The five consist of the first three, and green and purple. The seven consist of thp first five, and of white and black. The nine consist of th~ 1 flrst seven, and of stone and flame color. They are thus explained: The blue is an emblem of friendship; the red of zeal; the yellow of wisdom, on account of its resemblance to gold. Wisdom, saith the wisest of kings, is far better than fine gold. The green is a beau - tiful emblem of hope, and of that immortal part of man which never, never dies; the purple being a royal color, of dignity and majesty; the white of purity and innocence; the black of serious - ness and modestness of demeanor. The next color is that of stone, which denotes firmness and durability, and is an emblem of con - stancy, fidelity and decision of character—qualities which should be possessed by those who take the degree of Grand Master Archi - tect, and attempt to walk in the footsteps of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff, and the flame color of ardent affection and charity, the peculiar traits of a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason. The various colors united in this one girdle are expressive of that unity, and the olive interwoven of that peace, which should link us together as Brethren. As these various colors shine in your girdle, so let the vario,us 1 virtues they represent shine in your heart and life. Thus, my Brother, by your meritorious and unblamable conduct, assiduity, constancy and integrity, you have at last attained the title of Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason, which is the summit of Ancient Craft Masonry, and upon your arrival to which I most sincerely congratulate you. I most earnestly recommend to you the strictest care and circum - spection in all your conduct, that the sublime mysteries of this degree be not profaned or disgraced. j-a,5-~ ~ ( CLOSING T.

Deputy—Brother Master of Ceremonies, present the officers elect before the altar. [it is done.] CHARGE TO ALL Deputy—Officers Elect and Brethren. It is said by the Romans “Nobilitas at ohm ad officio,” (nobility, as of olden time, from a— a -i t 1 I I"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"FOURTEENTH DE~1REE 128 FOURTEENTH DEGREE 129 office.) OfYlce ennobles, when it is deserved, and is honorably filled, with honest performance of duty. Man has no other right than that of doing his duty. His duty is to sacrifice himself for others. To suffer, thereby to become strong; to die, to be born again immortal. The spirit of intellect is sacrificed by faith; the will by obedience; and life itself by martyr - dom. You are to be the chiefs, each in his station, of this body of Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons. It is self-denial, self-sacrifice that are Grand and Sublime. It is those who are capable of these, that are Elect Masons. It is for you to teach the Brethren this self-sacrifice, by examples; by the sacrifice of your own interests and pleasures to duty. If you do that, office will ennoble you. Then you will indeed be, what otherwise you cannot become, perfect Masons. - In a commonwealth, to respect and obey those who hold their power by the free choice of the people, is the highest duty which -that people owes itself. Towards them it should feel neither sus - picion nor distrust; and all should have one paramount object, to live together in harmony and union, and endeavor to aid and benefit each other. “Peace and harmony,” you very early heard it said in Masonry, “are the strength and support of all well - regula ted institutions, and more especially this of ours.” Perfect harmony, we do not need to be told, is not attainable here below. The independence of our nature, our passions, our peculiarities, all forbid that. There will always be in our Lodge differences of opinion, and, in consequence, hasty words, slighting expressions and resentments. The decisions of the Master will often be thought wrong, and sometimes prejudicial or partial. It is better so; for if it were not, and everything went on with unvarying smoothness, there would be no occasion for the exercise of generosity, forbear - ance and magnanimity. To err is human and common. To repent, to acknowledge the error, and to forgive and forget it, are equally noble; each requiring a lofty, generous and manly spirit, without which the nature of man would be farther from perfection than it is. Increase and strengthen these attractions which draw men to - gether and unite them. Masonry was intended to be joyous and convivial, and not sour, ascetic and formal. Calling from labor to refreshment originally had a real meaning and a worthy pur - pose. After their labors, the Brethren gathered round the social and festive board, and there, under the genial influence of the golden hour, all the distrust, jealousies and slight animosities melted away as thin clouds melt out the sky in summer. Adhere, my Brethren, to the old custom of refreshment, remem - bering the charge that you are not to turn it into intemperance and excess. After your meetings, gather around the table together, let heart open to heart, and kindly glances and pleasant words be inter - changed. The weariness of the evening ‘s work disappears, the little petty irritations pass away. The abs t are remembered, old asso - ciations are renewed, and the meinoi’ies of the dead, who used to be with us in such scenes, and whose places still lovingly recall them, soften our feelings towards the living.

The spirit of charity reigns, and when at last we are dismissed by command of the Grand Architect of the UnLverse, we depart at peace with ourselves and all the Brethren. Brother Master of Ceremonies, you will now place the officers of the Lodge of Perfection at the altar in due form to take the oath of office. The Master of Ceremonies arranges them ~n a semicircle, the Thrice Potent Master elect in the center, on the west side of the altar, all facing the altar, causes each to kneel on the right knee, and to lay the right hand on the heart and hold up the left hand. M. of C—Illustrious Deputy, the officers elect kneel at the altar in due form.

The Master of Ceremonies goes to the Thrice Potent, salutes, recovers, and conducts him to the left of the Deputy; salutes again, recovers, and then conducts the officers to their places and stations, heginning with the Tiler.

The seventy years of captivity have nearly expired. Cyrus has ascended the throne. We may now be restored to liberty. Come to us. Obey the sign, and destroy this. By ORDER OF THE COUNCIL. Soon after~the candidate enters the room, a brother approaches, and says: Bro.—My Brother, the hour is fast approaching that decides our fate: You are aware that all Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons that could be found have been summoned to meet to-day, to take into consideration and to devise means in regard to the course ~o be pursued to ameliorate our condition. Since the death of the Great Solomon, the destruction of the Temple and the cap - tivity, our beloved Fraternity has become more and more degraded. Grant that the labor of to-day may be the means of restoring us to liberty. He leaves the candidate, when he is accosted by another brother. Bro —My Brother, may this be a day of rejoicing for us.

A great change has taken place since our last convocation. Conflicting emotions of hope and fear ani - mate us all. Hope that the prophecy may be fulfilled and our liberty restored; fear that our taskmasters~ hearts may be hardened against us. But before we enter on the all-important business before us, let us offer up our supplications to Him who rules us all, and ask His blessing on our deliberations.

Thou didst appoint a stated period for the captivity of Thy people in Egypt and Babylon, and Thou hast taught us the signs whereby we may learn the approach of our redemption from the long cap - tivity which Thy just judgment inflicted upon us. Arise, 0 Lord! and have mercy upon Thy Zion, for the time to favor her, yea, the set time is come. Stir up the heart of Cyrus, Thy servant; for it is written “The heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory.” Into Thy hands we commit our undertaking. From Thee alone do we expect success in our en - deavors; for vain is the help of man without Thee. Finally, 0 Lord, we pray Thee to incline the hearts of all our 4 i,I~ 4 FIFTEENTH DEGREE 137 brethren to assist in the work on which we this day solicit Thy blessing. Amen. So mote it be.

Have faith, my brethren, and success will attend us. ~ [AU arc seated.] S. W~—Thrice Potent Grand Master, since the death of Solo - mon, King of Israel, the destruction of the Holy City and the Tem - ple of the Most High God by the warlike hordes of Nebuchadnez - zar, the sacred vessels removed, and the chosen people led away captives, our lot has been most degrading. Under the dread power of Nebuchadnezzar and Balthasar we have been forced to labor as slaves to our captors. And although repeated efforts have been made by petition to our masters to relieve us from the galling chains that bind us, instead of producing the desired effect, they have sub. jected us to renewed persecutions and a more rigorous discipline. This is our condition at the present time. Our sufferings, priva - tions and repeated failures have produced a disastrous reaction, and a settled despair has manifested itself among us. Let us banish these sentiments and resolve to succeed. J. W.—Thrice Potent Grand Master, the time, the place, and the occasion are fruitful events. Let us this day select from among our number a delegation to approach the throne of Cyrus; and lay before him the history of our privations and sufferings. And who, of all among us, is better qualified to lead such an embassy, than the Prince of the House of Judah, the noble Zerubbabel? G. 0.—Thrice Potent Grand Master, I rise to second the appeal of our Brother, the Junior Grand Warden, in favor of Zerubbabel. Well do I know the heartfelt anguish he has experienced on wit - nessing the wrongs done to his brethren. His talents, eloquence and truthfulness will prevail. We shall be free, and obtain permission to build the Temple. T. P.—Most wise has been the suggestion offered. Zerubbabel, Prince of the House of Judah, [Zerubbabcl ri-scsi to you has been intrusted the negotiation of the liberty of a great people.

M. of C.—Thrice Potent Grand Master, it is with great dif - fidence I rise at your call for my services, but I am pleased to be selected as the humble instrument to carry into effect your noble designs. I feel confident of success, and will accept the trust. T. P.—++~ [All rise.] We shall be free, my brethren. Most noble Zerubbabel, may the deeds you are now about to perform become ever memorable in the annals of Maspnry. Select from among our number those you wish to accompany you on your journey.

The delegation salute and retire, and enter upon their journey, passing over the bridge. On approaching the Palace of Cyrus, their way is obstructed by a sentinel. Sentinel—Who comes here? A!. of C.—We are an embassy to the Great Cyrus of the East. Sentinel knocks. Guard opens the door, and is informed as to the embassy.

A!. of 0.—The first among my equals, a Freemason by profession, a captive by disgrace. Guard—What is your name? A!. of C.—Zerubbabel. Guard~—What brings you here? A!. of C.—The tears and misery of my brethren. Gi~ard-What do you intend to do? A!. of 0.—En the name of the Lord God of Israel, to implore the justice and goodness of your sovereign, and demand his grace for my brethren, who have been in captivity ten weeks of years. Guard-What grace do you ask? A!. of 0.—That, under the influence of Heaven, your sovereign will grant us our liberty, and permit us to rebuild the Temple of the Grand Architect of the Universe. Guard-All the King’s servants, and the people of the King’s provinces, do know that whosoever—whether man or woman—shall come uncalled unto the King, into the inner court, there is a law to put to death, except such as to whom the King shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live. The wrath of a King is a mes - senger of death. A!. of 0.—Still, the heart of the King is in the hands of the Lord, and, as the rivers of water, ~he turneth it whithersoever he will. Guard enters, and reports to the Grand Master of Infantry as foflows: Guard—Zei~bbabel and his companions, captives, the first among their equals, request to appear at the foot of the throne.

Embassy enter and prostrate themselves before the King. Cyrus—f Extending his sceptre.1 Rise, Zerubbabel, and your companions. I have been made acquainted with your petition and know your request. I am willing to accede to it on one condition. I have always felt the greatest veneration for the Masonic myste r - ies. If you will communicate them to me, I promise on the instant to grant your petition. A!. of C.—One of the principles of our Order, 0 King! is equality. How can it reign here? Your rank, your grandeur, are incompatible with our Fraternity. Besides, the engagements we have entered into, and which we cannot violate, prevent me from unveiling to you our secrets and mysteries. When Solomon taught us the words of the wise, and made known to the builders of the Temple the treasures and hidden riches of secret places, he said a talebearer revealeth secrets, but he that is of faithful spirit con - cealeth the matter. If our liberty is to be obtained only at such a price, or on the condition you offer, we prefer to remain in cap - tivity. Cyrus—Reflect well on your refusal. Remember, on yourselves alone depend the liberation of your brethren, and permission to rebuild the walls of the Temple. It is my intention to decorate you in like manner as the grandees of my Court, and to deliver to you all the riches which were taken and carried away by my predeces - sors. Can you hear such things without being moved? Do you persist in refusing your former riches and liberty? A!. 67 0.—We cannot, 0 King, accept them on the conditions you propose. Cyrus—I will then see whether your bodies will prove as in- vincible as your souls. Guards! make them pass through the ~fire. Guard causes the embassy to pass through the ordeal by fire. Cyrus—You have a foretaste of the sufferings you will endure if you persist any longer in refusal. I allow you but one moment to make your final decision. On the instant answer me. A!. of 0.—We cannot betray our obligations as Freemasons, though it should gain all you promise for myself and brethren. F ii FIFTEENTH DEGREE 141 Cyrus—Such strength of mind surprises me. My esteem for the Order is greatly increased. It is far from my thoughts to put into effect menaces which were intended only as trials. Noble members of my Court! my object in summoning you this day was for the purpose of obtaining your advice relative to a singular dream I had during the last night. The visit of Zerubbabel at this time, I believe, has some connection with it. I will relate it, and will be guided by your advice. And you, Grand Master of my Palace, who are endowed ‘with the sublime gift of explaining dreams, I request of you an interpretation thereof. A!. of P.—This gift, 0 King, is not the result of natural wisdom, and if I am favored with it, it is because it has pleased the Grand Master of the Universe to bestow upon weak humanity the skill to interpret visions, through which He deigns to manifest his de - crees. 0 King, live forever! Tell thy servant the dream, and he will endeavor to show the interpretation. God speaketh once,—yea, twice—but man perceiveth it not. In a dream—in a vision of the night, when sleep falleth upon men, then he openeth the ears of men,/ and sealeth their instructions. cyrus—Grand Master of the Palace, I appreciate the spirit with ‘~vh=ch you are filled. Lo! this is what I saw in my dream: “An angry lion was about to throw himself upon me and devour me, and, while quaking with fear, I looked for some place of shelter. A splendid light, proceeding from a ‘glory,’ suddenly dazzled my sight, and I perceived two of my predecessors, Nebuch - adnezzar and Balthasar, in the garb of slaves, and loaded with chains. I heard a voice saying to me: ‘Loose the bonds of wicked - ness.’ ‘Undo the heavy burdens.’ ‘Let the oppressed go free.’ ‘Break every yoke.’ My spirit was troubled, and my sleep fled from me. Art thou able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? M. of P.—O King! He thaCrevealeth secrets hath made known unto thee while slumbering what shall come to pass. The voice you heard was that of the Grand Architect of the Unive rse, who has permitted you to conquer and have dominion over the House of Israel. The captives he commanded you to reslore to freedom are those who for ten weeks of years have groaned in bondage. The Grand Architect wills that you render back to them the same liberty which they formerly possessed, that their property be restored to —i ~II"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"142 FIFTEENTH DEGREE them, and their city and Temple be rebuilt in all its former splendor. By the chains with which your predecessors were loaded is indi - cated that they were, in the hands of the Grand Architect, the instruments of the punishment he wished to inflict on his people, who have suffered for the excesses to which they had abandoned themselves. The lion ready to devour you presages the end you may expect if you remain deaf to the voice of God. The God of Israel will come up against you like a lion from the swellings of Jordan, except you let his oppressed people go free. Cyrus—These are the words of truth. The God of Israel hath spoken. He must be obeyed. I will build the Holy City again, on its own heap, and let the captives go. Not for price nor for re - ward. Let the captivity be finished. [AU rise.] Let Zerubbabel go free, and with him all his people. Go back to your country. I permit you to rebuild the Temple destroyed by my predecessors. The treasures of that Temple shall be sent you before the setting of the sun. As an earnest I present you these few costly vessels. You shall be acknowledged as a chief over your equals. I will that every aid and succor be furnished to you, even as to myself, in every place through which you will have to pass, and that from my treas - ures there be delivered to you that which will suffice for the offer - ing of sacrifices on your altars, and whatever else shall be needed to render homage to the Grand Architect of the Universe and im - plore his protection for me and m-y people. Approach, and receive the particular proofs of the friendship and esteem which you so justly merit from me. The embassy kneel at the foot of the throne. I arm you with these swords as a mark of distinction among your equals, and I create you “Knights of the East.” Cyrus then gives the accolade to each member of the embassy, and places a green sash on the right shoulder, saying: I have adopted these decorations in imitation of those conferred on the workmen of your Temple; but these marks are unaccom - panied by any mysteries; yet I grant them only to the princes of my house. From this day you are entitled to enjoy the same privileges. I consign you to my generals, who will attend to your departure and that of your people. So I order. Go in peace. A!. of C.—Most noble and generous sovereign! accept from my - self and my brethren our heartfelt thanks. My feelings overpower I, 4 FIFTEENTH DEGREE 143 me. May the God of our fathers protect your majesty and your people. The embassy make salutation to the King, and retire, carrying with them some of the sacred vessels. In the meantime, the embassy approach the bridge on their return. When on the bridge, they are challenged. Enemy—Who goes there? A!. of C.—We are in peace. Enemy—What is your desire? A!. of C.—To cross the River Euphrates. Enemy—Whence do you come? A!. of C.—From the p~ovince of Babylon, by a decree of Cyrus of the East, to return to the land of Judah and rebuild the House of the Lord God of Israel. Enemy—We care not for the king’s decree, but if you will de - liver into our hands those treasures you have, you shall have liberty to pass. Otherwise, you shall be smitten with the edge of the sword. A!. of C.—We cannot profane the vessels of the House of the Lord by delivering them to the Gentiles. The God of Sabaoth will be our shield and buckler. In Him we trust. Forward! A violent conflict ensues. The enemy is repnised, and driven off the bridge. The candidate loses the sash presented by King Cyrus. All cross the bridge. As soon as they arriv on the opposite side, they all kneel. A!. of C.—Le us, my brethren, offer a sacrifice to the God of Sabaoth, who as delivered us out of the hands of our enemies. PRAYER ~O Lord God of Sabaoth! who hath delivered us from our strong enemy, and from them that hated us, we bow the knee to thank Thee. As for God, His way is perfect. The word of the Lord is tried. He is a buckler to them that trust in Him. God is our strength and power, and maketh our way perfect. He teacheth our hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by our arms. God has also given us the shield of our salvation, and His gentleness has made us great. He enlarged our steps under Eus, so that our feet did not stip. We have pursued our enemies and have destroyed them, and turned not again until they were consumed. Amen. They now proceed on their journey and arrive at the Hall of the West.

W.—Thricc Potent Grand Master, I present to you Zerub - babel and his companions, who desire to be re-admitted to the bosom of the Fraternity. T. P.—V~enerable brother, relate to us an account of your mis- sion. A!. of C.—Thrice Potent Grand Master, King Cyrus having per - mitted us to appear at the foot of the throne, manifested grcat interest in the narration I gave him of our mysteries. He promised to restore myself and my fellow-captives to freedom, and grant them permission to return and rebuild the Ten~ple of our God, on condition that we would reveal to him our sacred mysteries. We refused the boon he offered at such a price. He then tempted us with riches and honors, but in vain. Finding our souls unassail - able, he menaced our bodies with the most severe sufferings. We remained true and faithful to our obligations as Masons. He ex - pressed surprise at our firmness, and an increase of esteem for our mystic Order, and said that it was farthest from his thoughts to push to extremity menaces which were intended merely as trials. The council of the King had been assembled on that day for the purpose of giving their advice in regard to a singular vision had by his Majesty, and twic& repeated the night previous, which he imagined was intimately connected with my visit and our petition. He then related his dream, which was interpreted by the Grand Master of the Palace—a wis and good man. He statcd that the vision of the King was a v~ itation of the Grand Architect of the Universe, who was angered at the inhuman treatment of his chosen people, and that the Kin and his subjects would be visited by divine vengeance unless th~ captives were allowed to go free. The King, believing these to be l~he words of truth, proclaimed our free - dom, and granted us permission to build our Temple. He ordered all the former riches of the Temple to be restored, and armed me with his sword, for the defense and succor of my brethren, honor - ing us with knighthood. I departed with an escort, according to the order he had given. Notwithstanding all this, I was attacked by enemies, at the passage of the river. Thcy regarded not thc decrec of the King, of which I informed them, but said they would give us liberty to pass if we would deliver up the treasures we had with us.

We then offered up a sacrifice to Him who shielded us from our enemies. The remaining portion of the journey was performed in safety. T. P.—The loss you have met with, my brother, is but a depriva - tion of the symbol of worldly care and pomp. Our principles founded on equality cannot be known to, or appreciated by, the prince, our liberator. The loss you have sustained, is of profound marks of distinction only. It suffices if you have preserved those of Freemasonry. Before we can receive your companions as brethren, we wish to ascertain whether they have preserved the virtues and knowledge of Masonry while in servitude. A!. of C.—Interrogate me, Thrice Potent Grand Master, and I will answer. T. P.—To what degree have you advanced in Masonry? A!. of C.—To that of Perfection. T. P.—Give me the three signs of a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason. Candidate does so. T. P.—Give me the three tokens. Candidate does so. T. P.—Give me the Passwords and Covered words.

Have you any such? A!. of C.—We have vessels presented us by Cyrus. 1Z~-P.—Deliver them to the Treasurer. Zerubbabel and compan - ions, as a reward for your faithfulness, zeal, and valor, receive from us the mysteries of our re-union, and a Masonic acknowledgment of your rank as a Knight of the East.

The Senior Grand Warden will cause the candidates to advance by 5 and 2 sLeps. Kneel. Left hand on the heart; right hand on the Bible and two cross swords. OBLIGATION What is promised by man, gifted with five senses, uninfluenced by force, power, fear, or human violence, I believe to be an ever - lasting obligation which none but men void of honor and honesty will violate. So believing, I obligate myself never to reveal the secrets of this degree to any one. I further promise to adore the God of Sabaoth, to assist the dis - tressed, to be kind to worthy strangers, to shun the vicious, to ob - serve the laws of my country, to aid in burying the dead, and to protect the innocent. If I ever violate willfully this my obligation of a Knight of the East or Sword, may I be regarded as a false knight, and be de - graded and dishonored, and may the God of Sabaoth be my aid to keep the same.

P.—My brothers, the destruction of the Temple had exposed the Freemasons to such severe disgrace, that we were afraid their captivity and misfortune would have contributed to corrupt them and render them la~ in their duties. This is the reason why, in waiting for the promised moment of re-edification, we retired to secret abodes, where we faithfully preserved some remnants of the ancient Temple. We admit none save those whom we try and prove by their signs and words, as well as by their conduct, to be true and legitimate brothers of the Craft. We then communicate to them the mysteries of our re-union, but we expect of them in re - turn some scattered pieces of the ancien emple. The liberty you have obtained for us, and the efforts you have made to join us, testify too much. in your favor for us o conceal anything from you.

Some are engaged in drawing plans, others mould - ing, cutting stone, etc. Each brother has a sword, either in his hand or within his reach.

While waiting, a sentinel hastily enters. Sentinel—Grand Master, an attack was made by a small body of the enemy, who endeavored to surprise our outposts, but being on the alert, they were beaten and driven back, with slight loss to us. G.

Has the Sovereign Grand Architect of the Universe placed the mallet in your hand for naught ‘?—to sit here in inactivity’? And you, Knights, what is it you thus thoughtlessly do? Was it for this you have been redeemed from captivity’? Let the time that has past suffice for having been spent in sighs and tears. No longer waste your time in idleness. Shame on you, to be thus inactive, while the grass and weeds are growing over the foundation of the House of Jehovah, and the reptiles are polluting the sacred ruins. Arouse! G. M.—You well know, 0 Pontiff, how great was the ardor of these Illustrious Knights in former days. When they left Babylon they were full of zeal. You yourself were a witness of t;heir ex - ploits. They then overcame all opposition, and surmounted every obstacle. But alas! in vain did Solomiel and his workmen work with expedition, while their enemies were continually on the alert to surprise them. In vain did these Knight-Masons labor with the trowel in one hand and the sword in the other, ready either for work or for combat with their enemies. Counselors hired against us have frustrated our best intentioned designs, and we are contin - ually harassed in our work by the cabals of our foes, who are sus - tained by civil power. Our will is to be act;ive in the prosecution of our duties as Masons, but we are circumvented, and nothing is left to us but; vain sighs and tears, instead of confidence and joy. H. P.—I come, in the name of Jehovah, to declare to you his will. Arm yourself with strength, Zerubbabel—arm yourselves with strength and faith, all of you who hear me. Set about the work of re-edification in earnest. Do not despair of success. Be en - couraged to persevere; for it is so prophesied. The Sovereign Grand Architect is on your side. If Jehovah is for us, we need not care who is against us. J. W.—Sovereign Master, inspiring are the words we have just listened to. They impart new life and vigor.

He was in alliance with us before he ascended the throne, and he cannot have forgotten our ancient friendship, nor will he be deaf to our complaints. S. W.—Sovereign Master, we must do more. Our petitions will have little efficacy if expressed in writing only. Your presence will give to them greater weight. Deign, then, yourself to be our am - bassador. Resources shall not be wanting. There is not one of us but will cheerfully and liberally contribute all the means that may be necessary for the purpose. H. P.—Joy! for the people you have saved from captivity will rejoice indeed, when you lead and direct them in the great work of re-edification. To you alone will belong that glory. You will be the angle which will bind the building. In you will be found the heart to dare and the hand to do. From you will proceed the Masters and Intendants of the work. G. M.—Generous brethren and beloved Knights, your request and your counsels have determined me, and I depart according to your advice and desire; but it is expedient that four of your prin - cipal Knights should accompany me, as much for the majesty of your embassy as for its security against its adversaries which will not suffer us to proceed on our expedition without opposition. I pray you, therefore, to allow to march with me the Illustrious Knights I may select to aid me with their arms and their counsel. I propose— (Names the candidate and three other Knights, in all making four, besides Zerubbabel) Knights distinguished for their talents and constancy during the events that have so oppressed our hearts. Do you assent that they be ass6~diated with me in this embassy’? The Knights give the sign of assent. Draw near, then [iutming the Knights selected] that you may take upon yourselves the engagements ap pertaining to your new func - tions, and give to this Council assurance that they can rely on your devotion in the important enterprise we are about to undertake. The Grand Master of Ceremonies now causes the four Knights selected to kneel at the overthrown altar, and also causes them to put the points of their swords, which they ho]d in their hands, on the altar. He then dictates the following~ SIXTEENTH DEGREE 159 OBLIGATION ______ in the presence of the Knights here assembled, do promise and swear upon my sword to be faithful to the secrets of the embassy I am about to engage in, and to devote myself faith - fully to its performance.

M.—Let; nothing more prevent us from proceeding on our mission. Let us now put on our armor and depart instantly. The Sovereign Prince Grand Master draws his sword, and directs his companions to do the same. They now appear before the altar and give the salute. G. M.—Attention, Knights! Right face!

In consequence of the kindness and benevolence with which you formerly favored me, they have been induced to hope that, in choosing me as their representative, you would be pleased the more graciously to receive what I have to communicate in their behalf; and I myself am happy, while paying you their tribute of respect, to have the opportunity to acquit myself also of what is due to our former friendship. Darius—Zerubbabel, your people have not misjudged. They could not have selected an agent to act for them that could pos - sibly have been more acceptable to me than thou art. We notice with pleasure that you have not forgotten our ancient ties of affection and friendship, and Darius will not, on his part, forget those ties which were dear to him while yet in private life.

Satrap of Assyria, do you state the question, and the reward we have promised to him who shall answer it in the most satisfactory manner. The Satrap rises, makes an obeisance to the King, and turning towards the assembly, says: S at rap of A.—The King of Kings, wishing to dispense his favors with a liberal hand, has deigned to promise the second place near his august majesty, the privilege of being clothed in purple, wear - ing a golden baldric, and being seated on a golden throne, to him who shall be able in the most satisfactory manner to resolve the question: “What is that which holds the most powerful sway over mortals’?” The Satrap now turns to Darius. Can it be possible that a question like this can for one moment be a subject of doubt or deliberation to any one who adverts to thee, thou Son of the Sun’?

Shall I dare to differ in opinion from the Satrap of Assyria, who has received the plaudits of your whole court’? He contends there is nothing greater than yourself. 0 King! I acknowledge your great - ness—the ec7at of your name, the splendor of your throne, the mag - nitude of your power, and the grandeur of your riches. But greater than all this is the empire of Beauty! This softens the heart of the most ferocious, gains over judges the most severe, and triumphs over masters the most imperious. Deprived of for. tune, it needs it not. If devoid of worldly rank and dignity, it rises above all. All stations of life are subject to it. The power of the gods of the earth, though respected and feared, is as nothing in comparison with the power of beauty. All applaud more loudly than before, except Zerubbabel and his com - panions. After a ~vhile Zerubbabel rises. G. M.—Wliat is this, 0 Darius, I hear in your court’? It is al - ready corrupted by flattery and effeminacy’? Reject! reject with indignation those sentiments of yourself that have just been uttered. Strength and power reside in kii=gs. Beauty has its influence, but it is the mark of wisdom to acknowledge the empire of Truth. Truth is omnipotent—greater than any transitory throne—more endurable than any frail, decaying beauty. These are both of short duration, but truth lives forever. Darius—Yes, Zerubbabel; come, and by receiving the reward so justly due you, cause to shine forth the triumph of truth. Re - ceive this order. Places sash of Prince of Jerusalem on his neck. Ascend the throne and take your seat at my left hand. Artaban, invest Zerubbabel with a robe of purple. Satrap of Assyria will invest. The highest award we can bestow upon you will not be commen - surate with your deserts for having saved us from this snare of corruption. We are infinitely indebted, besides the recompense offered, and in order to attach nearer to our person so precious a friend as thou art, Zerubbabel, we tender you, this moment, the office of Grand Master of our House. Darius descends from the throne and leads to theThanquet hall. Zerubbabel and his companions follow. The courtiers follow them. When the banquet is over, al] will return to the Council hall, and be seated as before. Darius—By eating and drinking together, we have renewed and cemented the ties of our ancient friendship. Speak therefore, Zerubbabel, with confidence, and state unreservedly what you have to ask in behalf of your nation. a. M.—Great King, the misfortunes of my people are not un - known to you. Consult the annals of your empire. You will find therein that Cyrus, feeling for our misfortunes, freed us from our chains. He gave us permission to rebuild the wall of our city and the Temple of th~ living God. But, alas! such happy auspices were of short duration. Incessantly persecuted by the hostilities of the Syrians and Samaritans, we were not able to carry on our work save with the trowel in one hand and the sword in the other. Soon after the loss of our potent protector, our labors were totally obstructed by the perfidious acts of our enemies, who de - picted us to you as seditious and dangerous to your government and person. We have in consequence been forced to abandon our works. Remember, most august King, the vow you formerly made to the sovereign dispenser of crowns, that if you ever obtained the one you now wear, you would advance Lhe rebuilding of the holy Temple, and make restitution of all its treasures. Your wish has been accomplished, but your vow has not been fulfilled. This is the grace I humbly pray for. Darius—Our promise and our vow shall be fully executed.

The Guard of the Tower then opens the door to ascertain that the Tyler is at his post, and the Temple secured from all outward curiosity.

Brother Master of Ceremonies, prepare the novice, and bring him forth, fully clothed and in the usual manner, for presentation to us. Master of Ceremonies retires, prepares the novice in black, and apron of the Seventeenth Degree. My Brother, all is changed on the face of the earth. Consterna - tion and dread are spread over it. The veil of the Temple is rent asunder, the implements and pillars of Masonry are broken, the cubic stone sweats blood and water, and the Word is lost. The Order is thrown into consternation and dread by the loss of the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"190 EIGHTEENTH DEGREE EIGHTEENTH DEGREE 191 Word, which has occurred notwithstanding all our precaution. We are in ignorance of the means to make use of for its recovery. How, then, can we know each other? Will you assist, us m re - covering the same? Are you willing to aid us in our search? The candidate replies. The l~daster of Ceremonies says: 2W. of 0.—Follow me. He conducts him to the door of the Chapter, where he knocks as a Knight of Rose Croix. Guard of the Tower from within says: G. of the T.—Brother J. W., a Knight of the East and West kno6ks at the gate of the tower. J. W. repeats it to the S. W., and he to the Most Wise. 2W. W.—Perfect Knight S. W., please ascertain who knocks. S. W. repeats it to the J. W., and he to the Guard of the Tower. G. of the T. [Opens the door and says.]—Who are you, and what do you want? 2W. of 0.—It is a Knight of the East and West who is wander - ing in the woods and mountains, and who at the destruction of the second Temple lost the Word, and humbly solicits your aid and assistance to recover it. G. of the T. [Sh’u,ts the door and says.1—Brother J. W., it is [repeating the answer.1 J. W. repeats the same to the S. W., and he to the Most Wise. 2W. W.—What claim has he for the favor? S. W.—By following us in the path which leads to perfection, and learning with us the three precepts on our columns. 2W. W.~-Let him enter. All lights are extinguished, except that on the table of the M. W. The Most Wise now seats himself, his elbow resting on the table, and all the brethren seat themselves on the floor, the right leg over the left, the right elbow on the right knee, their heads down and resting on the right hand, their left hand on the left knee, the brethren all having their jewels covered with crepe. The candidate is conducted to the center of the room facing the East so that the pile of rnins may be directly before him, then the S. W. says: S. W.—Most Wise, we have the pleasure of introducing to you a Knight of the East and West, who humbly solicits your aid and assistance to recover the “Word.’’ 2W. W.—Respectable and Perfect Rnights, this is the last hour of the last day of the seventh year that the construction of the Temple continued, let us unite and sanctify this day. - S. W.—The Temple is destroyed, the implements broken, and impious rites obscure the truth. J. W.—The Shekinah is mute and invisible. 2W. W.—My dear Brother, you find us in solemn contemplation of dire calamity; all nature is paralyzed; darkness overspreads the earth; truth is fallen; the earth quakes; her bowels are rent; and the veil of- the Temple is rent in twain from the top to the bottom. At these last words the curtain is drawn aside by ~mseen hands. The blazing star is no more to be seen, the columns and corner - stone are broken and cast among the ruins; its implements are broken and destroyed; the cubic stone sweats blood and water; on the cross where truth was sacrificed the mystic rose droops and the Word is lost. Our sheet anchor in this storm of adversity is the Word, which will point us to the blazing star of truth. That this beautiful object may ever abide with you, and form a shining light in your mind, is the object of the ceremonies of this Chapter. Are you prepared to search for the Word and for Light? If the candidate assents the Most Wise ~ ~, and says: 2W. W.—Most Perfect Knight Master of Ceremonies, teach this Brother the wisdom of our sublime institution. The Master of Ceremonies now causes the candidate to wash his hands and face in pure water, and says: My Brother, you will, f or your instruction, listen to a lesson from the Orator. Ora.—”Jn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. “The same was in the beginning with God. “All things were made by him; and without him was not any - thing made that was made. “In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. “And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness compre - hended it not.”—JoHN i, 1-5. 2W. W.—Brother Master of Ceremonies, cause the candidate to enter upon his travels to learn the beauties of instruction. The travels consist of seven journeys round. When the candidate passes before the altar he must kneel, and when passing in the West he bends his"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"EIGHTEENTH DEGREE EIGHTEENTH DEGREE 193 192 right knee. He is made to observe the columns, and repeat the name of each as he passes them. On the fourth journey, starting from the North, the i. W. says: J. W.—O Lord, instruct us in what virtues we most need. The Guard of the Tower says—’ ‘Faith,’’ 2W. of 0.—Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. By “Faith,” Abraham, when he was tried, offered up his only begotten son. By “Faith” the children of Israel forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king. By “Faith” they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians, essaying to do, were drowned. By “Faith’’ the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were com - passed about seven days. “Faith” subdueth kingdoms, worketh righteousness, obtaineth promises, stoppeth the mouth of lions. This brings the Master of Ceremonies and candidate to the starting place again. Start on the fifth journey from the North. J. W.—My Brother, Faith is the first principle and pillar oI~ our Order. In the dangers and difficulties which press around us, who shall deliver us? The G. of the T. answers—’ ‘Hope’’; and the eleven lights on the column are exhibited. 2W. of 0,—Blessed is the man who trusteth in the Lord, and whose Hope the Lord is: for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when h~at cometh, but her leaf shall be green, and shall not be careful in the year of drought. The “Hope” of the righteous shall be gladness, but the expecta - tion of the wicked shall perish. The wicked is driven away in his wickedness, but the righteous hath hope in his death. This brings the M. of C. and the candidate to the starting place, when they halt, and I~4. of C. says: You ‘will please give attention to a lesson from the Orator. Who reads: II 4 4 Ora.—Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the Likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Where- fore God bath’ highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. On the sixth journey, in starting from the North, the i. W. says: J. W.—What advantages do we derive from all our travels? The G. of the T. says—’ ‘Charity”; and the eleven lights on the column Charity are exhibited, when the Master of Ceremonies commences his journey, and says: A!. of 0.—Though I speak with the tongue of men and angels, and have not Charity, I am become as a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. Though I bestow all my goods to feed the~ poor, and give my body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity van nteth not itself; is not puffed up; Charity never faileth. And now abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity—these three; but the greatest of these is Charity. This brings the Master of Ceremonies and the candidate to the starting place again, when they halt. 2W. W.—Hear then the words of the New Law: “As my Father hath loved me,” saith the Lord, “even so I have loved you. A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.” This brings the candidate to the seventh and last journey, which is per. formed in silence. During that journey, while returning to the West, the M. of C. says: 2W. of 0.—My Brother, your travels are accompLished; forget not the three virtues which you have learned to recognize in your journey. S. W.—Most Wise, the journeys are accomplished. M. W.—My Brother, what have you observed in your travels? I"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"194 EIGHTEENTH DEGREE EIGHTEENTH DEGREE 195 A!. of 0.—Three virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, to guide my future life. Are there any others? 2W. W.—No, my Brother, you have no others to accomplish, for these are the principles and pillars of our mysteries. You will now approach the throne, and take an obligatiom to remain faithful to its principles. Brother Master of Ceremonies, conduct the candi - date to the throne. He is conducted to the sitar, kneels On both knees, his right hand on the New Testament, then the 2W.

That I will stand to and abide by the laws, statutes, and con - stitutions of this Chapter. And I do finally on my word of honor promise and engage to recognize and obey, as the only legal head of the Ancient and Ac - cepted Scottish Rite, the Supreme Council of Sovereign Grand Ins pecto~s-General to which I owe allegiance. And may the Author and Foundation of this, our mystery, keep me steadfast. Amen. He kisses the volume ~seven times. A!. W.—Oonsummatum-est. Perfect Knight Master of Cere - monies, conduct the candidate to the privacy of the ante-chamber for further instructioti. The hi. of C. conducts the candidate to the preparation chamber and then instructs him as follows: Chapter for your final instruction without possession of the mystic words. I will now communicate them to you. The words are Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum, which being translated are: Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. The initials only of these words are required. They are I.N.RJ. Let us again alarm the door. (2W. of 0. knocks 6 and 1.) G. of T.—[From within.]—Brother Junior Warden, there is an alarm at the door. J. W. [Repeats.] S. W.—Most wise, there is an alarm at the door. 2W. W.—See who knocks, my Brother. J. W.—Brother Guard of the Tower, see who knocks. J. W. [Repeats it.] G. of T. [Knocks 6 and 1; opens the wicket, and says]—Who knocks? 2W. of 0.—A Knight Mason, who having passed through the most severe trials, hopes to procure of you the Word as the reward of his ‘toils. ~G. of T. repeats to the i.

G. of T. opens the door and says: G. of T.—Let the candidate be introduced in due and ancient form. The candidate is then placed in front of the transparency representing the ascension, the brethren forming a semi-circle, the M. W. and Orator in front pf the whole; the S. W. then says: S. W.—Most Wise, I present to you a Knight Mason who hopes to procure us the lost Word, and thus become a perfect Mason. 2W. W.—From whence come you, my Brother? Oan.—From Judea. 2W.

He then anoints the candidate upon the back of his right hand and upon his forehead, repeating as he does so, the following: M. W.—God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness. Let this bc~ a memorial of your devotion to the noble work of the true Knight of Rose Croix, strengthening you in hearing the banner of the cross joyfully among men. M. W. suspends the crimson ribbon about his neck, saying: M. W.—This is the badge of the Knight of the Black Eagle, its color being significant of the zeal and ardor which should inspire the honored possessors of the Word. From this ribbon and jewel you must never part, not even in death; it will instantly recall you to virtue, should you ever be so unfortunate as to fall from her path. The august mystery contained in the allegory of this jewel, which you already know, and which will soon be developed to you A 7 in a more vivid manner, will teach you how sacred and sublime is the degree into which you have just heen received. 2W. W.—Brothcr Master of Ceremonies, conduct the candidate to the throne, there to be constituted, and receive the words, signs, and tokens of this degree. M. of C. conducts him to the altar, and causes him to kneel. The M. W. leaves the throne with his sword in his left hand, and his gavel in his right, approaches the candidate, and says: M.

Before we part, let us eat together the bread earned by our labors, and thank our Heavenly Father for furnishing us with the means for sustaining Life.

In silence and order the knights follow the M. W. and form a circle about the table—the M. W. facing the West, with Wardens opposite.

INVOCATION Sovereign Creator of all things, and source of life and light, who provides for all our necessities, bless the nourishment for the body we are about to take, and make it to give us strength to labor for Thy glory and the advancement of all the great interests of humanity. Amen! ADDRESS From time immemorial, man has plighted his faith and con - fidence in his fellow man by drinking from the same cup and eat- ing from the same loaf. / Among Eastern nations at the present day this method of solemnizing a pledge has been retained. We learn from history, and our fathers, of the Masonic faith, that in the ancient mysteries of Judea and Egypt, the newly initiated were presented with bread and wine as a symbol of the new life they were about entering upon, and thaI they were henceforth to be devoted to the laws of truth, and knowledge of their rights and duties. -! This feast, and the bread and wine of which we partake, are to us symbols of fraternity and brotherly affection, and of that per - fect union that must ever subsist among Brother Knights of the Rose Croix. Thus, Brother Knights, are we assembled, solemnly and frater - nally pledging ourselves one to another in brotherly love, in the presence of the an~e1s and of that great Intelligence that surrounds us in our every action. Niost Wise breaks the bread, takes a piece and eats, and, passing the plate, says: Take, and eat, and give to the hungry. Music soft. Then taking the goblet, drinks, and passes it, saying: Take, and drink, and give to the thirsty. TO CLOSE To order, my brethren. All make sign of Good Shepherd.

Most Wise—My brethren, we have met this day for the purpose of commemorating the death of our Lord and Master. Today is the anniversary of the last supper of which He partook with His disciples. On that occasion He instituted a memorial of His broken body and shed blood, and was thereafter betrayed by Judas the traitor. Let us remember the sad transaction, one and all.

SCRIPTURE READING If ye then be risen with Christ, seek, those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your af. fection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in Glory. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornica - tion; uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry; for which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: in the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. CONFESSION—ALL Almighty and most merciful Father, we have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the de-. vices and desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We have left undone those things which we ought to -have done; and we have done those things which we ought not to have done; and there is no health in us. But thou, 0 Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare thou those, 0 God, who confess their faults. Restore thou those who are penitent—accord - ing to thy promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, 0 merciful Father, for his sake, that we may hereafter live a godly, righteous and sober life, to the glory of thy Holy Name. AMEN.

Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me; thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.

Behind the curtain that conceals the platform in the East should be a fine representation, by painting, of the New Jerusalem—a square city, suspended in the clouds, and represented as descending from the heavens to the earth by slowly unrolling or lowering the painting. The city is represented surrounded by a halo; it has twelve gates of pearl—three on each s[de—and at each gate an angel, with a name written on his crown, which are the names of the twelve tr[bes of the children of Israel. Through the city flows a river, on either side of which is a flourishing tree, bearing twelve fruits, answering to the twelve precious stones in the Grand Pontiff’s breastplate. Under this movable painting is a representation of the city of Jeru - salem in ruins, and in it a serpent, with three heads, in chains, as if about to be crushed by the descending celestial city.

P.—And I saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it; and the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten iL, and the Lamb is the light thereof; and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it, and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor nnto it; and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day, for there shall be no night there, and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they which are written in the Lamb ‘s book of life. My Brother, if you believe in these promises, go now to the altar, and there assume the obligation of this degree. OBLIGATION ~ Both hands resting on four great lights and cross•swords. I, , in the presence of the eternal and everliving God, do hereby and hereon most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, that I will never reveal the secrets of! this degree to any person in the world, except to him to whom the same may lawfully belong, and then only when I am lawfully authorized and empowered so to do. I do further promise and swear that I will obey the laws, rules, and regulations of any Chapter of this degree, of which I may become a member—the edicts, laws, and mandates of the Grand Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret of the State of and the constitution, statutes, and edicts of the Supreme ii ii Grand Council of the Thirty-third Degree, within whose jurisdic~ tion I may reside, so far as the same may come to my knowledge. I do farther promise and swear that I will devote myself, my heart, and my hand, to the cause of Truth and Justice, to struggle against intolerance and fanaticism, ignorance, superstition, in - dolence, ingratitude, and intemperance; and that I will in all things ‘consider only what is right and just~ for me to do, and not whether any benefit to myself will result therefrom. All of which I do most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, binding myself under no less a penalty than that of being hailed a false knight and faithless soldier by every honest man and true knight throughout the world, if I fail in this my voluntary obligation. So help me God, and keep me steadfast in the due and punctual performance of the same. Amen. Salutes the Holy Volume once. T. P.—Melchizedek, King of Salem, and Priest of the Most High God, met Abram at the Valley of Shaveh, which is the king’s dale, as he was returning from the slaying of Lhe kings and the recovery of his brother; and he gave him bread and wine, and he blessed Abram, and said, “Blessed be Abram of the Most High God”; and he offered him tithes of all. So do I, my Brother, give you my bless - ing, and raise my hands in like manner as Abram, craving from heaven a tithe of God’s goodness. M. of C. gives T. P. the perfumed oil, who anoints candidate on the crown of the head, saying: I anoint and sanctify you; be thou a Priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek—virtuous, sincere, equitable, true, and tem - perate—minister of justice and priest of toleration. Be faithful to God, thy duty, and thyself, and thus deserve the term of Sublime Pontiff, or Scottish Mason, which you are hereafter entitled to wear. Rise and receive the V. P.V.

They shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy; he that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life, but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels. This Cordon of crimson, bordered with white, teaches you that the Ecal and ardor of a Knight and Pontiff ought to be set off by the greatest purity of morals and perfect charity and beneficence; the twelve stars upon it and upon the fillet allude to the twelve gates of the new city. This Fillet is the peculiar emblem of your Pontificate, and as the slightest contact with earth will soil its spotless purity, remember that so the least indiscretion will soil the exalted character you have now voluntarily assumed. Receive this Jewel, and let the letters upon it—the first and last of the Greek and Hebrew Alphabets—remind you of Him who was from the beginning, and ever shall be—the Alpha and Omega, the first and the last—on whose premises we rely with perfect con - fidence; in whose mercy and goodness we implicitly trust, and for the fulfillment of whose wise purposes we are content to wait. My Brother, but little may be said as to the representation you witnessed in the East. To us, as Masons, the city overturned and in ruins represents the empire of Evil finally overwhelmed and destroyed in the last conflict of the principles of light and dark - ness, which event mankind has, in all ages, expected, and the holy books of every ancient nation have foretold. The city descending from heaven is the new empire of Light and Truth, for which we wait and hope. The Tree of Life is emblematical of Truth—the basis of all the virtues represented by its fruits. The buildings of gold, and walls of precious stones, and gates of pearl, are symbols of that glory which shall invest and make magnificent the universe, when sickness, and pain, and guilt, and evil, shall disappear forever, and leave the world again a paradise. The river, to the dwellers in Eastern deserts, was the type of purity and plenty; the tree, with its leaves and flowers and fruits, of Nature, who bestows her bounties and her many blessings with - out waiting for men’s thanks. The serpent writhing in chains has to us a peculiar significa - tion—it was promised that the off-spring of the *oman should bruise the serpent’s head. Fulfill thou the prophecy. CLOSING ft.

Exemplification is given in brief, but much important instruction of the true manner of conferring de - grees in the Ancient and Accepted Rite is impressed upon the candi - date, and he is charged, as a Master of all Symbolic Lodges, to preserve Masonry in its primitive purity. TIlE APARTMENT AND ITS DECORATIONS But one apartment is needed, and the assembly is styled a Lodge; the hangings are blue and gold. In the East is a throne, ascended by nine steps, and surmounted by a canopy. Over the East, lighting the Lodge, is a glory surrounding a triangle, in the center of which are the words “Fict Lux.” In the center of the room is a triangular altar, on which rest a Bible, Square, Compass, Sword, and Mallet. The altar has three columns about it, forming a triangle, on which are these words— on that in the East: “Truth”; on that in the West: “Justice”; on that in the South: “Toleration.” The feugh and smooth ashlars and working tools of a Symbolic Lodge are disposed about the apartment. The Lodge is lighted by nine lights of yellow wax, in a candlestick with nine branches, placed between the altar and the South; the lights are arranged in three triangles, one within the other. OFFICERS, ETC. Venerable Grand Master (is stationed in the East). Senior Warden (is stationed in the West). Junior Warden (is stationed in the South). Orator (is stationed in the North). Treasurer (is stationed as in a Symbolic Lodge). Secretary (is stationed as in a Symbolic Lodge). - Senior Deacon (is stationed as in a Symbolic Lodge). [220] Junior Deacon (is stationed as in a Symbolic Lodge). Hospitaler (is stationed to the left of the Senior Warden). A lodge cannot be opened with less than nine members. The brethren are sometimes termed Grand Masters. Apron :—Yellow, bordered and lined with blue; in the center of the area are three equilateral triangles, one within the other, with the initial letters of the nine great lights in the comers, arranged as follows: At the apex of the outer triangle, the letter C; at the right-hand corner, below, G; at the left-hand comer, V; at the apex of the middle triangle, H; and at the right and left-hand corners, P and H; at the apex of the inner triangle, the letter T, and at the right and left-hand corners, T and J. In the center of the inner triangle is the Tetragrammaton, and across it, from below upwards, the words “Ftat Lux.” Cordon :—A broad sash of yellow and blue, passing from the left shoulder to the right hip. Jewel :—Of gold; upon it the triangles, letters, and swords, as upon the area of the Apron. Battery :—+ ++ OPENING G. M. +—Brethren, I am about to open this Grand Lodge; clothe yourselves and repair to your respective stations. Brother Junior Deacon, see that we are duly guarded. J. D. [Ascertains.] —Venerable Grand Master, we are duly guarded. G. M.—Brother Senior Warden, ascertain if all present are Grand Masters. S. W. [Ascertains.]—Venerable Grand Master, all present have the Word, and are Grand Masters. G. M.—Brother Senior Warden, what are the appropriate jewels of a Grand Master? S. W.—Those which compose the triangle in the center of the Lodge, and are placed upon the columns — ftruth, Justice, and ftoleration. G. M.—My brethren, let the great lights of the Lodge be lighted. Each officer advances in turn and lights one of the candles in the great candlestick, and then returns to his station, saying, as he lights the candle, as follows: Hosp.—Let Veneration for the Deity burn in this Lodge as its first great light. J. D.—Let the light of Charity shine in this Lodge. S. D.—Let the light of Generosity be lifted up in this Lodge.

M.—Together, my brethren. t t RECEPTION The candidate wears the collar and jewel of a Grand Pontiff and the jewel of a Rose Croix Knight. The S. D. conducts the candidate to the door of the Lodge-room, and + ++, which is replied to by the J. D. The nine great lights are extinguished. J. D.—Who seeks admission here? S. D.—A Grand Pontiff, who desires to be qualified to preside over all Symbolic Lodges of our Order, that he may still further advance in Masonry. J. D.—Is it through mere idle curiosity, or for the sake of dis - tinction, that he prefers this request? S. D.—It is not. J. D.—Is he of that class of Masons, who, having obtained the degrees, repose thereafter in contented indolence, indifferent to the evils that demand to be redressed? S. D.—He is not. J. D ~-Is he of that class of Masons who are content to utter sentiments of approval, but press on uthers the performance of Masonic duty? S. D.—He is not. J. D.—Es he of that class of Masons who spare their own purse, and are ready to draw liberal contributions on those of others, for works of charity and the welfare of the Order? S. D.—He is not. J. D.—If he be one of these, let him withdraw; for such Masons we have no room, no need, no use. Do you vouch for him that he is none of these? I I S.D.—I do. J. D.—Tlien let him wait with patience until the will of the Grand Master and the brethren is obtained. The J. D. reports to the S. W., the same questions being asked and like answers returned as at the door, except the last remark of the J. D. The S. W. reports to the 0. M., the same questions being asked, and like answers returned. G. M.—My brethren, is it your pleasure that this candidate shall be admitted? If so, give me the affirmative sign. Right hand above the head. If any are of another opinion, give me the negative sign. Stretch right hand to the front, palm open and outward, as if repelling a person—the votes being all affirmative. Let the candidate be admitted. The candidate is introduced by the S. D. and placed in the center of the triangle formed by the three columns, and in front of the altar. My Brother, you have often knelt before the altar of Masonry, and you now stand before it again, inclosed in the great triangle formed by the three great columns which support this Lodge. Turn now, toward the South, and read the name upon the column. Cand.—Toleration. J. W.—No man, my Brother, has the right to dictate to another in matters of belief or faith; no man can claim that he is infallible, and the only possessor of Truth. It is no merit in man to enter - tam that faith which his birthplace, his education, or habit, have imposed upon him, without examination and investigation into the evidences on which it is based. When man persecutes for opinion’s sake, he insults the attributes of Deity. Do you admit the truth of these principles? Cand.—I do. G. Al—Turn now toward the West, and read the name upon the column. Cand.—Justice. S. W.—Man should judge others as he judges himself; find for their actions the excuses that he readily finds for his own; and look always for a good, rather than Eor a bad motive. Justice and equity are like the light and air—God made them common to all; and he who denies justice to his Brother, or wrongs ‘I"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"224 TWENTIETH DEGREE TWENTIETH DEGREE 225 him in his estate, his affection, or his reputation, is unfit to associate with his fellows. Do you recognize the truth of these principles? Cand.—I do. G. M.—Turn now to the East, and read the name upon that column. Cand.—Truth. G. M.—No falsehood can be other than an evil; it is an act of a coward; to lie, expressly or by implication, is base and dishonor - able; without Truth, there can be no virtue. God is perfect Truth, and every lie, prevarication, misrepresentation, coloring, or con - cealment, is an offense against him, and disgraceful to a Mason. Do you recognize the truth of these principles? Cand.—I do. G. M.—Will you make them hereafter the inflexible rule of your life, conduct, and conversation—letting no inducement, temptation, or necessity, however stringent, persuade you to swerve from them? Cand.—I will. G. M.—Kneel, then, at the altar, and assume the obligation of the rank and degree which you desire to receive. Candidate kneels, and places both hands on the lights, etc. OBLIGATION I, —, do hereby and hereon, in the presence of the God of Truth, Justice, and Toleration, and appealing to Him for the up - rightness of my intentions, most solemnly and sincerely swear, and to each Grand Master here present do most sincerely promise, pledge myself, and vow, that I will never reveal any of the secrets of this degree to any person in the known world, except to one who is duly authorized to receive them, and when I am fully authorized to conijnunicate them. I furthermore promise and swear that I will henceforward for - ever be guided and directed by the nine great lights of a Grand Master, as I shall be informed thereof hereafter. I furthermore promise and swear that I will not govern any Lodge, or other Masonic body, over which I may be called to pre - side, in a haughty or arbitrary manner, but with gentleness, urban - ity, and courtesy; and that I will use my best endeavors to preserve peace and harmony among the members thereof, and all Masons everywhere. I furthermore promise and swear that I will never assist in, be J present at, or consent to, the conferring of this degree and dignity upon any Mason who will not and does not answer, and, as I be - lieve, truly, heartily, and sincerely, all the questions asked of me at the door, and here before the altar and within the columns. To all of which I do sincerely and solemnly swear, binding my - self under no less a penalty than that of being despised and exe - crated by all Masons, and detested by all whom I hold most dear on earth. So help me, God, and keep me steadfast. Amen. Candidate salutes the Holy Volume thrice. INVESTITURE G. M.—Rise, my Brother, and let me put you in possession of the P.v. S.W. V. Battery. The Apron, my Brother, with which I now invest you, is tri - angular in shape, as indeed are all the aprons used in this Order. It is unnecessary to state to you that its form relates to the fourth great light, which reminds us of the Deity and his attributes; the yellow relates to the superiority of the grade, while the blue border and lining is the emblem of Truth, which encompasses it; the triple triangle on the area exhibits the threefold power of God, and their angles the nine great lights, with the initial letter of each in the respective corners; the Tetragrammaton, crossed by the words, “Fiai lux,” in the center of the triangle, needs no explanation. The Cordon is yellow and blue, for reasons already set forth in describing the apron. The Jewel, also, is described by the representation on the area of the apron. My Brother, you will now approach the East. The 0. M. accompanies the candidate to the foot of the platform with nine steps, where there is a chair placed (but the candidate is not seated), and presenting him with the gavel, says: I now present you with this Gavel, as a symbol of a Grand Master of all Symbolic Lodges of our Order; remembering you are Master a4 1/item, or for life—that is, during your mortal exist - ence and your correct Masonic deportment in life—you are en - titled to assume the gavel in all Symbolic Lodges of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, providing there are none present superior to"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"3; 226 TXVENTI~TH DEGREE you in rank; but never fail to keep in mind the three requisites of a Master—Toleration, Justice, and - Truth. As the presiding officer of a Lodge, it will be your particular duty to dispense light and knowledge to the brethren. That duty is not performed—nor is that which the old charges require, that, at opening and closing, the Master shall give, or cause to be given, a lecture, or part of a lecture for the instruction of the brethren—by asking and receiving the answers to three or four merely formal and trivial questions. On the contrary, that duty is far higher and more important; and it behooves the Master to be prepared to perform it. Nor should any one accept the office of Master, until, by acquaintance and familiarity with the history, morals, and philosophy of Masonry, he is fitted to enlighten and instruct his brethren. That- you may ever remember that duty, you will now, under the direction of the Senior Warden, proceed symbolically to perform it, by restoring to us the splendor of our nine great lights in Masonry. The candidate will light each of the nine lights in succession, the G. M. saying, before and after each is lighted, and the candidate repeating, as follows: Let the great light of Veneration shine in our Lodge: venera - tion of God, the Supreme Father—not a slavish fear and adulation, but a loving reverence for a Deity infinitely wise, good, beneficent, and merciful.

PERSONS General George Washington Major General Richard Gridley Joshua Wentworth—Aide to General Washington Prince Hall Cyrus Jonbus Bensten Slinger Thomas Sanderson Peter Best General Washington is Beated at a large table in the Library of the El Ouse poring over a military map with ‘General ~ridley. An unlighted candle is on the table in a candelabra. Washington—You see, then, Gridley, it is necessary to consoli - date our gains by every possible device, and thus forestall another attack on Boston by the red coats. Gridley—’Tis plain we must do so, General, but how? That is the question. We have no batteries worthy of the name, while cap - tured prisoners say the Enemy opposite our lines is possessed of not fewer than two hundred and fifty cannon. Washington—Ah! Gridley, they were so possessed at Breed’s Hill, as against our two brass pieces and six iron six pounders. Gridley— ‘Twas the fortifications, General, the fortifications. Washington—Aye, it was indeed the fortifications, and that brings us to the point. I propose that we proceed at once to seize and fortify the high ground of Dorchester Heights, here, (point -"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"230 1 TWENTIETH DEGREE ing on map) overlooking the city and the harbor, and from there bring our artillery fire upon the Enemy’s shipping. Gridley—’Tis a brilliant plan, sir, but an arduous task. And whom do you propose to direct this difficult assignment’? Washington—Who indeed but the ablest engineer in the Con - tinental Army. If by chance that person has not come to your ac - quaintance, his name is Richard Gridley. Gridley—Oh no, no, sir. Such tasks are for a younger man. My devotion to my country’s cause does not abate, but the state of my infirmity is proof of how I have long cheated the calendar. Washington—General Gridley, a man is no older than his arteries and as young as his devotion to people and causes. - Enter Wentworth. Washington—What is it, Wentworth’? Wentworth—Craving your pardon, Sir, for the intrusion; but there are some persons of color at the door who seek an audience with Your Excellency. Washington—Ascertain the nature of their errand. Wentworth—I have so endeavored, Sir, but they stoutly persist in their prayer to present their matter to Your Excellency in person. Washington—Did you make known to them that I am occupied with grave matters concerning the campaign’? Wentworth—That I did, Sir, and right earnestly, but they were not to be dissuaded, -and only persisted all the more in their im - portunities. Washington—Very ~vell, let them enter. Wentworth salutes and retires. Gridley—If I may dare to suggest, Sir, the great cause you serve is jealous of the time you allow to trivialities. Washington~—And what is a triviality’? Would it be the dust of the stars’? The sceptre of a dead king’? The cry of a new born babe’? or even the liberty of a single human being’? I wonder, I wonder. Enter Wentworth followed by Hall, Jonbus, Sanderson and Best. All bow. Washington—Gentlemen will you by whoever is your spokesman state the purpose of this interview’? Ilall—(Bowing) General Washington, I have the honor to speak TWENTIETH DEGREE 231 for our company who have been delegated to present the prayer of a larger group of free men of color. Washington—I will hear you Sir, but the urgency of my com - mitments requires me to hear you briefly. IIall—(Bowing again) Thankee, Sir! It is about the Army, Sir! Our folk have been permitted only a modest share in the life of this colony. Even so, with the fortunes of all imperilled and with great issues at stake, we think that no man has a right to be a by - stander. We are but humble folk, but there be none ni’ore loyal to our country’s cause. Even the smallest measure of liberty is worth dying for. And so the free men of color who live in Boston and environs respectfully petition you Sir, as Commander in Chief, that they be permitted to enlist as regular soldiers in the Patriot Army. Washington-—’Tis a noble sentiment and well expressed, but your petition presents a novel point and I am not sure of my pre - rogatives with respect to it. Gridley, what think you of this pro - posal’? Gridley—As you say, General, it is a noble sentiment, but sir, we must look well to the rank and file of the Army. ‘Twere inex - pedient at this critical stage of the campaign to risk offence to their sensibilities. I fear a general dissent by the men to the enlistment of colored soldiers. Hall—Sir, I can not see why! What objection could they have to sharing the burden of defending our common land? May I re~ mind you that a man of color, Crispus Attucks, by name, has been the first to make the supreme sacrifice for the cause—indeed a vicarious sacrifice. Washington—C ris pus Attucks’? Hall—Yes, Your Excellency. He was an escaped bondman who took asylum in this free town, and was the first to fall by the bullets of King George’s soldiers. He thus bought his own ransom and paid the first installment on the price of American liberty. He now lies in a patriot’s grave in the Middle Burying Ground. Washington-—What say you of this, Gridley’? Gridley—’Tis doubtless true, for it has been much reported hereabouts. But, Sir, I observe that the speaker wears in the lapel of his coat a Masonic emblem. May I inquire by what authority he does this’? Hall—By authority of due initiation into the Fraternity. Gridley—Where and when’?. 4! 3, 33 31"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"232 TWENTIETH DEGREE [Iall—In Lodge No. 441 of the Irish Registry attached to one of the British regiments in the army of General Gage, where I and fourteen other men of color were on March 6 of this very year initiated into the three degrees, agreeably to the ancient Landmarks. Gridley—In a British Army Lodge did you say’? Do you admit to the Commander-in-Chief of your country’s armed forces, and to himself a distinguished Mason, that you dared consort with the Bnemy to be made a Master Mason’? What manner of patriot are you to do such a thing? halt—It was only after our legitimate prayer with proper avouchment would not be entertained by no less a Masonic body than the Lodge oI~ St. Andrew here in Boston. And sir, may I remind you that when we sought this privilege the Declaration of Independence of the Mother Country had not been made. Gridley—Even so, I can not give countenance to any commerce with men from whom the Lodge of St. Andrew would not receive a petition. General Washington, at the time mentioned, the Lodge of St. Andrew was presided over by General Joseph Warren ‘who fell at my side at Breed’s Hill. He was my friend and brother. We signed a secret agreement with each other that in the event of hos - tilities with the Mother Country we would join the Patriot Army. For me to advocate the cause of men he deemed not to be fit timber for the Masonic Order, would betray both his memory and his friendship. Washington—My good friend and Brother, I regret I can not share your opinions. Warren was a just man and a good Mason. May God rest his illustrious soul! But for his untimely death, I doubt not that, like the most of us, his opinions touching human rights would have been much amended. In the crucible of trials the dross of our minds is consumed and only the pure gold re - mains. We are and have been faced with trials. As Tom Paine, our adopted brother, is accustomed to say: “These be the times that try men’s souls” (Turning to Prince Hall) Sir, I am not certain of my prerogatives in the circumstances, and shall put the matter to the Congress whose servant I am. Meanwhile, I shall take the responsibility of granting your petition until my judgment is re - versed. Wentworth, write down this General Order as I dictate. Wentworth—Aye, Sir. (Takes seat at table and writes as Gen - eral Washington dictates.)

I shall lay the matter before Congress, who, I doubt not, will approve of it.” hall—Sir, I thank you with al] my heart, and be assured that those to whose prayer you made this answer will never betray your trust. Washington— ‘Tis well. Gridley, Masonry is a beautiful system of Morality, veiled in allegory, and illustrated by symbols. It can no more be the sole possession of one race or group of men than can be the multiplication table. What man is there who can say that two times two make four and that fact is exclusi~’ely his very own’? Or, who is he that would claim for his sole possession the Golden Rule? With no more right or reason can our glorious Institution be so circumscribed. Masonry brings to a common level men of all castes; brings to a common altar men of all religions; provides a common language to men of all tongues ; unites into a common band of brothers men of all races. Whoever alarms the door shall state his avouchment as a man alone, and shall not say, “I seek entrance as~ Aryan, or Semite, or Hottentot.” Gridley—Sir, I am fully persuaded. Even if it were otherwise I would, like a good Mason and a good soldier, bow to the judgment of my superior. Washington—That sentiment, Gridley, is worthy of the man and Mason you are. Come, Brothers, the dusk of evening comes down upon us and leaves us in the darkness much as does the dush of intolerance settles down upon our minds and leaves us confused and uncharitable. (Rises and goes to the candle on the table. All rise as General Washington uncovers.) Washington—If we are good Masons we are good Patriots. So let the great light of Patriotism shine in our hearts as in our Lodge: patriotism willing to sacrifice itself for the common good, even when neither thanks nor honor follow it, but does the right without ~.regard to consequences; the patriotism of Leonidas, who died to hold Thermopylin; o Curtius, who leaped into the yawning gulf; of Socrates, who died because the law willed it, rather than escape; of all who love the soil that gave them birth enough to die for it unwept, unhonored and unsung. Fiat lux! With the concluding ~vords General Washington lights the candle. All—So mote it be. Amen, Amen and Amen. ~i~1 I~f -4 .3"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"234 —k TWENTIETH DEGREE CLOSING G.

Why, how this knave convicts me without witnesses! Wilt thou not question further? Shall I bear further outrage? I demand judgment on this slanderer! H. of 0.—I further claim, in token of the justice of my cause, that the triple-test of ancient time be demanded of the Count; that the ever-consuming flame shall wither the brand if I am not sincere in my motive and accusation; that the purity of the holy incense shall attest the claim to my rightful inheritance, and the troubled waters of the limpid stream shall further attest the wrong of the honored Count, in withholding, through fraud, connivance, and forgery, my rightful due.

The M. of C. holds one end of a rod over the flaming incense. M. of 0.—Let the ever-consuming fire wither this brand, if I am not sincere in my motive and accusation.

M. of 0.—Behold my proof! Reinf. [Recovering] .—Il lustrious Lieutenant Commander, these strange and unaccountable incidents are not proof. This foreign Saxon is an impostor! By alchemy, he seeks to degrade and dis - honor me; and by so defaming and disgracing, to defraud me of my estate. Not one witness or jot of circumstantial evidence has been even yet adduced against my rightful deed. If aught is needed, let the Holy Church—which holds, under like tenure with myself —attest my claim. I call for judgment on this alchemist—this slanderer and false accuser!

The saw symbolizes that steady patience and persevering determination by which the reso - lute man makes his way to the object of his endeavor through all obstacles; and teaches us that Masons, laboring for the improve - ment of the world and the great cause of human progress, must be content to advance—certainly, though ever so painfully and slowly, toward~aeeess As the plane cuts down the inequalities of surface, it is symbolical of Masonry, which cuts off the prejudices of ignor - ance, and the absurdities of superstition, and -aids to polish and civilize mankind. The axe is the great agent of civilization and im - provement. It is the troops armed with that weapon that have con - quered barbarism. Under its blows the primeval forests disappear, and the husbandman displaces the wild hunter, and to the rude barbarism of the early ages sacceed settled society and laws, and all the arts that refine and elevate mankind.

The Candidate is made to use the plane; and then a brother brings him a piece of dry bread and a cup of water; and the Master Carpeater says to him: S. W.—Eat, my Brother, of the laborer’s food. It is thine own; for thou hast earned it; and no one suffers because thou dost eat. He is made to use the axe. Thea the Master Carpenter says: S.

Another voice cries aloud: Flee, children of Israel, for there hath come a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. Another voice cries: The children of Israel have murmured against the Lord, and against Moses and Aaron, for the death of Korah and his com pany: and he hath sent the plague upon them, and many thousands have died thereof; and the whole people is about to be destroyed. A profound silence continues for some minutes, and then, by means of a wicket prepared for tEe purpose, at the bottom of the door, a single feeble light is introduced, and the wicket silently closed again. Immediately a gong is sounded loudly by the door; it thunders again, and chains are rattled to - gether and dashed loudly on the floor. This is followed by groans and cries as of persons in extreme agony; and then by silence. Then the wicket is partly opened, and the M. of 0. in a disguised voice says to the candidate, through the wicket: M. of 0.—Hast thou repented of thy sins? Cand.—I have. M. of 0.—Pray then to the God of Israel for mercy and forgive - nessmlest He consume thee with fire, as he hath consumed Nadab and Abilin, the sons of Aaron, the High-Priest. After a pause of a few minutes, the M. of C. asks: M. of 0.—Hast thou bowed thee to the earth and prayed? If the candidate answers in the affirmative (and if he does not, the ques - tion is repeated at intervals, until he does), the door is opened, and the Iv!. of C. enters, and says to him: 4 M. of 0.—My Brother, thou hast heard of the awful punishment ‘<~ with which God hath visited those who, not being duly quali - fied, have presumptuously intermeddled with holy things.

DosL thy now dare to proceed? The candidate assenting, the M. of C. sprinkles him with water, and cuts off a lock of his hair, saying: /, Al. of 0.—I sprinkle thee with this pure water in token of that vnrity of heart and blamelessness of life which must hereafter characterize thee as a Levite without guile; and as I sever from thy head this lock of hair, even so must thou divest thyself of every selfish and sordid feeling, and devote thyself hereafter to the serv - ice of God, and the welfare, happiness, and improvement of man - kind. He then clothes him in a white tunic and white drawers, his feet bare, and a white cloth over his head, covering his eyes so as to prevent him from seeing, and then conducts him to the door of the Assembly, where, giving the battery, he is admitted. Upon entering, the Junior Deacon meets him, opens the tunic, and marks the sign of the cross upon his breast, saying: ‘- 0. of 0.—Upon thy entrance into this holy place, thou art marked with the sign of the cross, which, pointing to the four quarters of the compass, is a symbol of the Universe of which God is the soul; and it teaches how insignificant is man, and how con - tinually he should humble himself in the presence of that great being who knows his inmost thoughts.

The second apartment is furnished in every respect like the principal apartment in the twenLy-third degree, with these additions: In the East is suspended the Pentagram, or Blazing Star. There are two sets of hangings all around the room, one red and the other black. On the table of shew-bread, in the Tabernacle, is a silver vessel con - taining perfumed oil.

The apron, which is not worn by the first three officers, is of white lambskin, lined with scarlet, bordered with light green, and the flap light blue. In the middle of the apron is printed a representation of an Arabian tent, in gold; and on the flap a representation of a myrtle-tree, of violet color. The jewel is the letter Y, suspended from a short collar of narrow, watered, violet-colored ribbon.

P.—Prince Elisaph Ben Lael, I am about to open this Court of Princes of the Tabernacle, that ~ve may take counsel together for the welfare of the Order. See that we be well guarded, so that those entitled to do so can alone approach the Tabernacle. Or.—Valiant Grand Captain of the Guards, see that the Taber - nacle is ‘well guarded, so that none may approach it save those who are entitled to do so. The C. of 0. goes cut, returns, gives the battery, receives it in response, posts the brethren, armed with drawn swords, on each side, north and south, of the Tabernacle, and then, facing the West and saluting, reports: C. of 0.—Potent Chief of the house of Gershon, the sentinels are at their posts, and the Tabernacle is well guarded. Or.—Report the same to the Most Potent Leader. The C. of •G., facing the East, and kneeling on one knee: C. of 0.—Most Potent Leader, the sentinels are at their posts, and the Tabernacle is well guarded. M. P.—Thanks, my Brother!

The Orator, Secretary, and Treasurer receive the sign of recognition and the token, with the pass-word, from the bretbren, in then respective houses. The Treasurer gives tEem to the Secietary, and he to the Orator, who reports: Or—Most Potent Leader, all the brelhten in our houses, on the north, south and west of the Tabernacle, are Princes of the Taber - nacle, and have seen the perfection of the holy mysteries of the Hebrews.

It—It is time to proceed to discharge our duties. Assist me, Princes, to open this Cortrt! The sign, my brethren! All give the sign together, except the Wardens and Leader, who then give it in succession, the J. W. beginning. Then the Leader, Wardens, and others in the East, give the battery with their hands. Those in the West repeat it; then those in the South; then tbose in the Nortb. The M. P. stretching forth his hands: M. P.—The Lord bless you and keep you! All—Amen. M. 7Th—The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you. All—Amen. M. It—The Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace! All—Amen! So mote it be! M. It—Under the auspices, etc., I declare this Court of Princes of the Tabernacle to be duly opened. The M. P. gives one rap, and the brethren sit down, RECEPTION The Candidate, representing Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the High Priest, is clothed in a white tunic, without ornaments or insignia, and conducted to the door of the vestibule, in charge of the Expert, who enters with him with - out ceremony, and conducts him to the east of the vestibule, where the Grand Master of Ceremonies is seated, who thus addresses him: ~‘ M. of 0.—My brother, thou hast sought to be consecrated and sanctified in the office of the Prince of the Tabernacle. But before thou canst attain thy wish, and before the ancient ceremonies can be commenced, thou must, in the most solemn manner, give assur - ance that no unworthy motive prompts thee to seek to know those ancient mysteries which were instituted amoxjg the Patriarchs; and the knowledge of which is indispensable to him who would become a Prince in Masonry. Kneel, therefore, and place thy hand upon the Book of the Law, and make true answer to such questions as shall be asked thee! Dost thou now, representing Phinehas the son of Eleazar, solemnl?y declare that in seeking to know the hidden ancient mys - teries, thou are not actuated by any spirit of idle curiosity, or the I ii I ri i"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"266 TWENTY-FOURTH DEGREE pride of knowledge; but by a sincere desire to be better able to serve God, thy country and thy brethren, and more effectually to labor for the reformation and improvement of mankind? CaM—I do. M. of 0.—In the character of a Freemason, hast thou earnestly striven to discharge all the duties required of thee, and to live worthily, act justly, and fear God? Oand.—I have. M. of 0.—Hast thou, while a Freemason, done wrong to any one, with out making reparation, as far as was in thy power? Oand.—I have not. M. of 0.—Dost thou solemnly swear, upon the holy Book of the Law, and with thy heart open before God, and all its thoughts legible to him, that these answers are true and sincere, without equivocation or double meaning, or any mental reservation what - ever? ‘9 4”’ ‘1 Cand,—E do. The Exp. then raises him and places him between the altar and the East, facing the East; and the G. M. of C. says: M. of 0.—Thou desirest to know the ancient Hebrew mysteries. Thou seest above me the mystic triangle with the ancient Hebrew letter Yod in the center. it is an emblem oe the Deity, familiar to our masters, the Tiabalists. Kneel, and offer silently up to God thy prayers and thanksgiving I When thy prayer is ended, arise! The Candidate kneels, prays in silence, and rises: M. of 0.—My brother, the initiate is he who possesses the lamp of Trismegistus, the cloak of Apollonius, and the staff oe the Patriarchs. The lamp is reason enlightened by science; the cloak is liberty, or the full and entire possession of one’s self, which isolates the sage from the currents of instinct; and the staff is the assistance of the occult and eternal forces of nature. The lamp lights the present, the past, and the future, which are the three sides of the one triangle. It burns with a three-fold flame; the cloak is in three folds; and the staff is divided into three parts. This number, nine, is that of the reflexes of the Deity, and ex - presses the Divine idea in all its abstract power. Hence it is sacred in Masonry. For that it was that Hermes made it the number of initiation; because the initiate reigns over superstition, and by i’i~ I, k TWENTY-FOURTH DEGREE 267 superstition, and can walk alone in the darkness, supported as he is upon his staff, wrapped in his c[oah, and lighted by his lamp. Reason has been given unto all men; but all do not know how to use it. That is a science that must be learned. Liberty is offered to all; but all have not the power to be free. That is a right which we must conquer. Force is within the reach of alt men; but all men do not know how to lean upon it. That is a power, of which one must possess himself. M. of 0.—Be prepared now for admission to the inner mysteries! F A 4 ¾ 11 The M. of C. and Exp. now prepare the candidate. His right foot and leg, to above the knee, his left foot his fight arm, to above the elbow, and his right breast are bared. A cord is passed three times around his waist. The M. of C. leads him by this cord, and the Exp. holds him by the left arm. Thus prepared, he is conducted to the door of the Lodge. The second apartment is now hung with scarlet; and all the officers and members are in their places. The Exp. gives Ike battery of the degree, at the door. It is opened by tEe Asst. Exp., who inquires: Asst. Exp.—Who seeks admission to this inner chamber of the sacred mysteries? M. of 0.—Phineb as, the son of Eleazar the High-Priest, who, having been appointed to minister unto Adonai in the Priest’s of - fice, seeks to know the holy mysteries, and receive the indispensable degree of Prince of the Tabernacle. Asst. Exp.—Ilas he attained the degree of Chief of the Taber - nacle? M. of 0,—He has.

Exp.—Art thou actuated, in seeking to know the mysteries, by a sincere desire to be thereby better able to serve God, your country and your brethren, and more et’flciently to labor for the good of man?

Oand,—I am not. A set. Exp.—By what further right does he expect to gain ad - mission here? M. of 0.—By the sacred word. Aset. Exp.—Has he the sacred word? Al. of 0.—He has. Aest. Exp.—Let him give it. M. of 0.—He can not, except with our assistance. Aest. Exp.—Let him begin then. , * S Aset. Exp.—The word is right. Let him wait until the Most Potent Leader is informed of his request. The Asst. Exp. closes the door, goes to the front of the Tabernacle, and gives the battery; the M. P. asks the same questions, in substance, as were asked at the door; and like answers are returned; until he asks if the candi - date has the word; to which the Asst. Exp. answers: Aset. Exp.—He has, and with the aid of his guides has given it. M. P.—It is well. Since he comes endowed with these necessary qualifications, let him enter, and be received in due form. I’ This is announced to the candidate, and he enters. When within the circle, he is stopped by the Asst. Exp., who takes his right arm, and holds a burning if taper near enough to it to cause him to feel heat and pain, and says: Ass?. Lkr p—I test you by fire; and let this present pain ever remind you that he who rashly assumes to perform offices for which he is unfit deserves the fate of Nadab and Abihu, who were con - sumed by lightning from heaven, when they offered strange fire before the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai. The ~kndidate is then led once round the room, while the J. W. reads: J. W.—I will publish the name of God; ascribe ye grandeur unto our Elohim; His work is perfect; a]l His ways~are judgment. A God of truth, unmixed with evi], just and right is He. There is none like unto the God of Israel, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in His Excellency on the sky. The eternal God is our refuge; under us are the everlasting arms. He found Jacob in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; He led him about, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of His eye. The Lord alone did lead him, and no strange god was with him. A } 4’ ‘I A] TWENTY.FOURTH DEGREE 269 The candidate is now halted in the North, near the Treas., who pours water on his head, and says: Treas.—Thou hast reached the North. I test thee with water, the second test. Let it ever remind thee that none but the pure of heart ci~n be admitted to the holy Tabernacle in the heavens; where God, who is infinite purity, presides; and tbat it is reformation and repentance, and not the blood of animals sacrificed, that wash out sin; of which reformation, the lavation of the body is a symbo]. Then the candidate is again led once round the room, while the S. W. reads: S. W.—The Priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near; for them the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the Lord. When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee, and it would be sin in thee. That which is gone out of thy mouth thou shalt keep and perform. I will raise me up a faithful Priest, who shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed forever. The candidate is now halted in the South, near the Sec., who causes him to kneel upon a place prepared for the occasion with sand and gravel, on his naked right kuee, saying onto him: See.—Thou hast reached the South. I test thee with earth. It is the common mother, and to it our frail bodies return. It is well to kneel upon its bosom when we would implore the mercy and for - giveness of God. Let the beneficence of the earth, which produceth generously and liberally, even for the unworthy, teach thee gen - erosity; and that the open hand is fit companion of the pure heart. Then the candidate is again led once round the room, while the M. P. reads: Al. P.—The pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and he hath set the world upon them. He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. Arise, 0 Lord God! into thy resting-place, Thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy Priest, 0 Lord God! be clothed with salva - tion, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness! 0 send out thy light and thy truth! Let them lead me. Let them bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy Tabernacle! Then will I go unto the altar of God, the God of my life: unto whom the shields of the earth belong, the Lord God of hosts. -a II V"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"s~jV 270 TWENTY-FOURTH DEGREE The candidate is now halted in the West, near the Or., who says to him, while the winds rush by him; Or.—Thou hast reached the West. I test thee with air, the life of all men, the free, inestimable gift of God. Like Him it is mighty, but invisible. Like Him it blesses us ever. Be thou liberal and generous as the air, for if God freely gives thee light and air and asks in return nothing but gratitude and whispered thanks, thou mayest well afford to share thy plenty with thy destitute, afflicted, and unfortunate Brother. Brother Grand Master of Ceremonies, whence come you? M. of C-—Out of darkness. Ott—And whither go you? M. of 0.—To the East, the place of light, and cradle of the mysteries. Or.—’When the soul has expiated its faults, it will have become sufficiently strong to depart from the external darkness of the ter - restrial atmosphere, and to ascend toward the sun. What does this brother desire? Al. of 0.—To go the way that we have all gone before him, and so attain the light. Or.—Every man who thinks is anGildipus, fated to divine the enigma of the sphinx or to die. Every Initiate should be a Hercules, completing and rounding the cycle of a great year of labors, and, by sacrifices of the hdart and of life, deserving the triumphs of apotheosis. Is this brother capable thereof? Al. of 0.—I hope he is. Or.—The soul is immortal; but for the body, life cometh only out of death; and death is birth to a new life. If he, indeed, desires to see the light, shining in the darkness, and thus manifested, con - duct hiw to the altar of sacrifices, and let him there assume the proper obligation. The Candidate is now led to the altar of sacrifices, in front of the Taber - nacle, where he kneels on his right knee, facing the East, holding by each hand a horn of the altar. The point of a sword is placed against his naked right breast. Ia this attitude he repeats the following OBLIGATION I, , in the presence of the true God, do most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear; that I will never reveal to any person in the world the secrets of this degree, unless it be to one who is TWENTY-FOURTH DEGREE 271 legally authorized to receive them; and when I am legally author - ized to communicate them to him. I furthermore promise and swear, that I will remember and heed the lessons which I have received in this degree; that I will be generous and liberal to the poor, and just and impartial in public and private judgsnent, even when deciding between myself and another; that I will not harbor malice nor seek revenge, but will love my neighbor like myself, so far as human infirmity will allow; and that I will not oppress or take usury of a brother. And should I willfully violate this my obligation, I admit that I shall deserve to be consumed with fire from heaven, and that my ashes should be flung into the air, to be borne to the four corners of the earth by the winds; and may God aid me faithfully to keep and perform this, my obligation! The candidate is then told to rise. He does so, and remains standing blindfolded before the altar. A brother in the vestibule reads, in a deep tone, as follows: Abel became a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. It came to pass that Cain brought, of the fruit of the ground, an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, also, brought of the firstlings of his flock. And the Lord had regard unto Abel and Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not regard. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance was downcast. And the Lord said unto Cain: “Why art thou wroth, and why is thy countenance downcast? If thou doest well, canst thou not lift it up? But if thou does not well sin croucheth at the door. Though unto thee be its desire, thou shouldst rule over it.” Cain spoke with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him. [n the meantime, all the lights are extinguished, except a single lamp or candle; and, as the reading concludes, three brethren, clothed in black and wearing black masks, rush in, seize the candidate, in silence, tear the bandage from his eyes, and hurry him into the vestibule, where they force him into a coffin, placed on the floor in the middle of the room. They then throw a black cloth aver his body, leaving the face uncovered, and withdraw. Both apart - ments are now entirely dark. All is silent for a time, and then mournful voices are heard in the second apartment, saying, from different quarters of the room, as follows: 1st Voice—. . . Osiris, the god of light, is slain. The spirit of evil hath conquered, and darkness prevails over the earth. ‘A I I I ii >0"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"A IA 272 TWENTY-FOURTH DEGREE 2d Voice—...

The wintry iionstellations laugh for joy; and the earth is wrinkled with cold, and shudders at the darkness. 4th Voice—.. - Ahriman has prevailed over Ormuzd.

Atys is slain in Phrygia, and his body remains without sepulture, while all the land is cursed with barrenness, and Cybele seeks him, weeping, on the plains and among the mountains that resound with the clashing of her cymbals. 6th Voice—. . . Thammuz, mutilated by the wintry boar in Phcenicia, has descended to the shades, and left the world to mourn. Astarte, wearing the crescent, sitting with veiled head on Mount Libanus, besieges heaven with prayers for his return. 7th Voice—. - . Dionusos is slain by the giants; and the women mourn his death in the Etruscan forests and upon the Syrian mountains; and all the malignant signs of the zodiac rejoice. 8th Voice—. . . Mithras is dead, is dead. His body lies in the tomb, and the Magi weep over it, and chant their funeral hymns, while the shadows of night gather over them, and all Persia and Armenia mourn; but his suffering shall be the safety of the dis - consolate. 1st Voice—. . .

Lift upon us the light of thy countenance! 5th Voice—. . - Guide our footsteps, and direct us in the right path, 0 Lord our God. lo Nissi! Be merciful unto us, and with thy great light drive back the powers of darkness! During these last lamentations and cries, resounding from different di - rections, in mournful and piercing toiies, the coffin is taken up and carried TWENTY-FOURTH DEGREE 273 into the second apartment, and placed upon the floor in the center, with its head to the East. By this time the room will have been changed, by dropping hangings entirely black on the inside of the columns. Theie is still but a single dim light. At the head of the coffin is set an artificial tree of the thorny tamarisk or the acacia. The Princes now assume their seats, in perfect silence, all covered with black robes or mantles, entirely concealing their jewels and regalia. Then the M. P. speaks: Al. P.—My brethren, the power of darkness has prevailed over the prince of light. The earth mourns, and is wrinkled with frost. The leaves drop from the trees; snow shrouds the mountains, and cold winds sweep over the shuddering skies. All nature laments; and we share the common sorrow. Excellent Senior Warden, let prayers be offered up in the tabernacle for the return of light and the reascension of the Sun, and of that moral and spiritual light of which he is the type. S. W.—Most Potent, all the nations of the earth do fast and pray. Our ancient tashmasters on the banks of the Nile mourn for Osiris. The Chaldeans lament for Eel, and the Pho2nicians for Thammuz. The Plirygian women clash their cymbals and weep for Atys; on the Syrian hills and over the Etruscan plains the virgins lament for Dionusos; while far in India the Brahmans pray for the return of Cama; and in Persia the Blagi predict the resurrection of Mithras. The dead nill risc again, as the wheat grows from the grain; and all the world will then rejoice. Al. P.—We, like our ancient master, mourn Osiris; the type lo us of the sun, of light, of life. The scorpion and the serpent rule the winter waves on which the frail ark tosses that contains his body. Weep, my brethren, for Osiris! Weep for light lost, and life departed, and the good and beautiful oppressed by evil! Man hath fallen from his first estate, and is lost, as the sun hath sunken into the icy arms of winter. Weep for Osiris, type of the good, the true, the beautiful! How shall his body be recovered from the em - braces of the hungry sea; and earth again be gladdened by his presence? J. W.—Most Potent, nine Princes offer to go forth and search for the body of Osiris. Al. P.—Let them go forth, my brother, by threes, to the East, the West and the South, and make diligent search; while we con - tinue in fasting and prayer. ii 4- A’ —I The brethren walk around, as if searching for the body, and after a time they gather round the coffin; and one says:"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"9~-i 9 274 TWENTY FOURTH DEGREE Behold, my brethren, the body of Osiris under this spreading tamarisk. Each of the brethren makes the first sign, and says: God wills it. Then a brother says: Cover the face, my brethren, and let us hasten to return, and make known to the Most Potent Leader that we have found the body. They cover the face and return to the East, and the Exp. says: Exp.—Most Potent Leader, searching by the sea-shore, we have found the body of Osiris cast on shore at Byblos, and concealed by a tamarish tree, which, by the wonderful virtue of the body, had grown up around it in a night. Al. P.—Summon the Princes in your several camps, Princes, chiefs of the three houses, to attend us while we repair to Byblos; for It is promised that the dead shall rise again. Treas.—Prinees of the house of Merari, the body of the great King Osiris is found at Byblos. The Most Potent Leader is about to repair thither to give it burial, and commands you to attend him. Sec—Princes of the house of Kohath, the body, etc. Or.—Prinees of the house of Gershon, the body, etc. The brethren form a procession, and make the circuit of the room three times halting ~.fterward in a circle round the coffin. In the meantime, the red hangings are substituted for the black, the hanging,. curtain in front of the Tabernacle is raised, and the incense prepared to he lighted on the altar of perfumes. The bread ~and wine, with the oil, on the table of shew-bread, are also uncovered, and the seven lamps of the candelabrum prepared to be quickly lighted. Then the M. P., standing in the circle, at the foot of the coffin, the S. W. being at the head, on the South side, and the J. W. opposite him on~the North side, says: Al. P.—[Raising both hands toward heaven, the palms to the front] —It is the body. No man hath power over the spirit, neither power in the day of death. There is no discharge in that war. Man cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name is covered With darkness. Brother Junior Warden, can this body be raised to new life by the grip of an Entered Apprentice? J. W.—Most Potent Leader, it cannot. By the process of in - duction, from experience of facts made known to us by the testi - mony of the senses, it is not possible to prove the existence of the soul, much less its immortality. TWENTY-FOURTH DEGEtEE 275 The M. P. raising his arms as before: M. P.—O Lord, my God! Science fails us; and I fear the Mas - ter’s word is forever lost. Brother Senior Warden, can this body be raised to new life by the grip of a Fellow-Craft? S. W.—Most Potent Leader, it cannot. By logical formulas and dialectics it is not possible to demonstrate the existence of the soul, much less its immortality. Logic, like science, leads only to skep - ticism, and substitutes words in the place of thoughts. The M. P., raising his arms as before, says: --7 •‘/ I / I Al. P.—O Lord, my God, reason fails us; and I fear the Master’s word is forever lost. My brethren, assist me in endeavoring to raise this body by the Masters grip, called by our ancient masters the lion’s, and the symbol of faith. He takes off the covering, grasps the right hand of the Candidate with his right, places his left under his right shoulder, and with the assistance of the two Wardens, raises him to his feet, by the Master’s grip, and whispers in his ear, in English, the true triliteral sacred word, on the five points of fellow - ship. Or—Osiris is risen again, and prevails against the powers of darkness. Orpheus and Dionusos return from the shades, Cama and Atys rise again; and Adonai reigns henceforth in heaven. J. W.—The Sun turns back from the South, and darkness flees before him. To-day is the great feast of the winter solstice. S. W.—The reign of light and life has recommeneed. The feet of the young spring shine afar off upon the mountains; and the bull and ram lead on the glittering constellations. Let all the world rejoice! The reign of evil ends; and the good principle is victorious. Let earth and heaven be glad! Or—The seed dies, and out of its death springs the young shoot of the new wheat, to produce a hundred-fold. J. W.—The worm dies in its narrow prison-house, woven by itself, and out of its death springs the brilliant moth, emblem of immortality. S.

P. says: M. P—The Pentagram, which you see in the East, called in the Gnostic schools and in Masonry ‘‘The Blazing Star,” is the sign of intellectual omnipotence and autocracy. It is the star of the Magi; it is the symbol of the word made flesh; and, according as its rays are directed~ it represents good or evil, order or disorder, the blessed lamb of Ormuzd and St. John, or the accursed goat of Mendes, the scape-goat of Leviticus, con - secrated to Azazel. It is the condition of the Initiate, or that of the profane; Lucifer or Vesper, the Morning or the Evening Star. It is Mary or Lilith; victory or death; light or darkness. When it elevates two points it represent Satan, or the goat devoted to Azazel. When it elevates a single point or ray, it repre - sents the Saviour. The complete understanding of the Pentagram is the key of the two worlds. It is called the symbol of Lhe microcosm. It is abso - lute natural philosophy and science. In~{he center of this blazing star Freemasons place the letter G. It signifies gnosis and generation, the two sacred words of the ancient Kabala; and also the Grand Architect; for the Pentagram, whichever way we view it, presents the letter A. Th.e star of honor, substituted by ~apoleon for the cross of St. Louis, was the Pentagram substituted for the labarum; the reinstatement of the symbol of light; the Masonic resurrection of Adoniram. The winged-globes the scaraba~us and the butterfly, on the ribbon of~ the brethren, and the myrtle-tree on the apron, are all symbols of~ immortality.

God said to Moses, of Phinehas, Ben-Eleazar, Ben-Aaron: ‘‘I give unto him my covenant of peace. And he shall have it, and his seed after him; the covenant of an everlasting priesthood.” Brethren, behold a new Priest of the Tabernacle, to be instructed and prepared to fulfill all his duties as a prince of well-doers in this frail tabernacle of life that he may be raised on the great day of account, a shining monument of God’s glory, in the tabernac]e of eternity.

W.—You desire to attain the light. You can only advance toward its source and essence, which are of the Deity. So much of the truth as it is given to mortals to know is within the reach of those alone whose intellects are unclouded by passion or excess. To attain it, to comprehend the delicate distinctions of the thought in which, the truth is embodied, the intellect, like a keen instrument of the finest steel, must be able to dissect the thought, and distinguish one from the other its invisible nerves. The edge of the instrument is blunted by the indulgence of the sensua~appetites, of the intemperate passions of the soul. The Exp. having’retired, previous to the entrance of the candidate, and prepared himself by putting on a garment of sackcloth and a chain round his waist and over his shoulders, now raps at the door with three loud distinct knocks.

Rxp.—I am Eliab, the son of Pallu, of the tribe of Reuben, in sackcloth and loaded with chains, in token of the penitence of the people, who flee in terror before the fiery serpents that Adonai hath sent among them to destroy them. The C. of 0. closes the door, and reports to the S. W.: C. of G.—Nlost Valiant Grand Captain of the Host, it is one of the people of Israel, in sackcloth and loaded with chains, in token of the penitence of the people, who seeks admission that he may pray the Most Potent Leader to intercede with God, that He may forgive and spare them; for that they flee in terror before the fiery serpents that He hath sent among them to destroy them. S. W.—Most Potent Leader, one of the people of Israel waits without, in sackcloth and loaded with chains, etc. M. P.—Let him be admitted and led into our presence. The Exp. enters, is received by the M. of 0., and led to a point half - way between the Tabernacle and the East, wkere he is halted, facing the East. M. P.—Who art thou, and what dost thou seek? Exp—Most Potent Leader, I am Eliab, the son of Pallu, of the tribe of Reuben; and ii come hither in behalf of the people, who dare not approach the Tabernacle, because the Lord is greatly angered with them. M. P.—Ah, disobedient and stiff-necked race! How have they again tempted I-us anger? Exp—Most Potent Leader, the soul of the people was discour - aged, because of the way, journeying from Mount 2Hor, by way of the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom; and they spoke against Adonai and against thee, saying: “Why hath El-Shaddai and his servant Moses brought us up out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, nor any water, and our souls loathe this light manna. We go to and fro these forty years; and as Aaron died in the desert so also shall we all die here. Let us put trust in Adonai no longer; but let us call on the great gods Amun and Astarte, Osiris and Isis, to deliver us from this misery.’’ And as they cried aloud on them, lo! Adonai sent fiery serpents among them, by whom much people hath died. And those that 1’ [9 L} A’ [I"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"284 TWENTYFJFTH DEGREE TWENTY-FIFTH DEGB~E 285 remain have repented and said unto me: “Put chains upon thy neck in token of our penitence, and go unto Moses our leader, and beseech him to pray unto Adonai that he take away the serpents from us”; and I have done as they desired. M. P.—Hast thou also murmured and called upon the false gods? Exp.—I withstood the people and rebuked them, and they sought to slay me; but repenting sent me hither. M. P—Thou hast done well. Relieve him of his chains, and give him a seat oE honor; for he hath not forgotten his duty to God. The Exp. is relieved of the sackcloth and chains, and repairs to his -place in the Lodge; and the M. P. says: M. P.—Most Excellent High-Priest, take a censer, and put fire therein Erom off the altar, and pot on incense, and make an atone - ment for the congregation, for there is wrath gone out from the Lord. The Or. goes into the Tabernacle, puts incense on a censer and lights it, and stands between the Tabernacle and the East, bearing it in his hand. M. P—Most Valiant Grand Captain of the Host, thou hast in the West a Prince of the Tabernacle, who seeks to be permitted to ascend another step toward the mysteries of the Kabala. Let him approach the East, that he may see if he be worthy to receive that favor. The candidate, conducted by the M. of C., is led to the East, and placed, standing, in front of, and facing the Most Potent Leader, -who says: M. P.—My brother, life is a war, in which one must prove his soldiership, in order to rise in rank. Force is not given. It has to be seized. He t is only worthy oE initiation in the profounder mysteries who has overcome the fear oE death, and is ready to hazard his life when the welfare of his country or the interests of humanity require it; and to die even an ignoble death, if thereby the people may be benefited. Art thou ready to give that proof, and submit to that test, of thy fitness for initiation? Cand—I am. M. P.—Art thou prepared to go, barefoot and unarmed, among the venomous fiery serpents, if thereby thou canst turn away the anger of the Lord, and save the remnant of IBis people? Cand.—I am. M. P.—Return, then, to the West, and be prepared, that thou mayest speedily go forth upon thy mission, The candidate returns to the West, and wails, after his shoes and stock ings are removed, and a white robe is put on him until the proper moment. The M. P. goes to the Tabernacle, enters it, remains awhile, and returns to the East, bringing with him a serpent of brass, entwined round a tau cross, with its head elevated above it. When he takes his seat, M. P.—I have prayed for the people, and Adonai hath said unto me: “Make thee an image of a venomous springing serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.’’ Take thou, therefore Eleazar, the IBigh-Priest, this serpent and cross, and give it to the Prince of the Tabernacle, who now waits in the West. Let him place it upon a pole, and go forth to the congregation, bare - foot, and clothed in a white robe, and set it in the middle of the camp, and make proelamaltion that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live; for the Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgressions, and hast for - given His people, from Egypt even until now. The Or. takes the cross and serpent, goes to the West, and puts it in the hands of the candidate. The M. of C. assists him to make it fast upon a long rod; and they then go out together. After remaining without for awhile, and such scene being represented as ‘will best convey an idea of that described on the Mount, they retuin, and advance to the East, leaving the cross and serpent in the anteroom. When they are in front of the East, M. of 0.—Most Potent Leader, great is Adonai the God of Mercy; for he hath had mercy on his people Israel. This Prince of the Tabernacle hath gone fearlessly into the midst of the camp, among the fiery serpents, bearing the brazen cross and serpent, symbols of everlasting life; and every one that hath beheld the serpent, owning his sin and doing homage to the Most High, is healed, and liveth; and the plague of the serpent is stayed. M. P.—Praise ye the Lord, my children, the supporter of the heavens and the earth,! for he is great and his mercy endureth for - ever, and he hath forgiven his people Israel. M. P.—The plague of serpents is stayed; and as they have fled to their caves, so the celestial serpent flees, with the scorpidn, before the glittering stars of Orion. The great festival of the vernal equinox approaches, and it is time to prepare ourselves by purification for"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"286 TWENTY-FiFTH DEOBEE the Passover. Light will soon prevail once more over darkness; and the pulses of life again beat in the bosom of the earth, long chilled by the wintry frosts. S. W.—Most Potent Leader, what shall be done with the brazen cross and serpent when the people again set forth upon their way? M. P.—Let it be borne before the congregation, and be forever a symbol of faith, by the dying out whereof in the hearts of nations, they fall into decay; and lest the knowledge of its true symbolic meaning should in time be lost, and the people hereafter imagine it to be something divine, and worship it, we will perpetuate its remembrance of this day ‘s events, and the true meaning of this and our other symbols, and of the fables of Osiris and Ormuzd, and Typhon and Ahrixnan, as the last degree of those sacred mysteries which Joseph, the son of Jacob, like myself, learned from the Egyptians; and which I have taught to you, such as our forefathers practiced them on the plains of Chalda~a. Kneel, therefore, my children, and with me swear, in the presence of the Most High God, faithfully to keep the secrets of this degree, and to perform the duties and practice the lessons which it inculcates. The candidate kneels at the altar of sacrifices, and all the brethren in a circle around him, on one knee; and all repeat the follo~ving OBLIGAT ION I, ——-, do solemnly promise and swear, in the presence of the Most High God, that I will never reveal the secrets of this degree of Knight of the Brazen Serpent, nor allow them or any of them to be revealed, if it be in my power to prevent it, to any person in the world who shall not be duly entitled to receive them, nor without,~due authority so to disclose them, lawfully obtained. I furthermore promise and swear by the faith that is taught to me in this degree that I will at all times be ready to risk my life in the cause of a friend, of my country, or of humanity, when the obligations of friendship, or patriotism, or duty demand it. To all whereof II bind myself, under no less penalty than that of being held base and unworthy, and tortured by the fiery ser - pents of remorse and an accusing conscience forever! So help me God! and aid me to keep these promises! Amen! 287 TWENTY-FIFTH DEqBEE M.

If we are not in possession of the truth, help us to attain it. If we already have it, help us to look with compassion on those who are less fortunate than we, and yet perhaps more deserving of Thy mercy! Help us to resist and subdue our evil passions, our pride of opinion, our bitter and revengeful feelings! Hasten the coming of that promised dawn, when persecution shall cease, and all man - kind shall feel that there is no heresy so monstrous as persecution and intolerance!

E.—My brother, you have ascended too high in Masonry to be longer subjected to physical tests and trials, or you would again in this degree have represented the Fellow-Craft or Companion advancing toward the Master’s degree. M. K—It has often been asked concerning you, in Masonry, whether you were duly and truly prepared. We would fain know whether you are so now.

E.—Behold, the darkness is past, and the true light now shin - eth. My brother, you have before this been brought to light in Masonry, when the Worshipful Master, with the aid of the brethren, first made you a Mason. You have been taught to believe in the true God. You have passed through degrees intended to remind you of the Essenian and Hebrew mysteries; and in this you have heard described those practiced by the first Christians. We shadow forth the secret discipline of the early Christians, as we do the other mysteries, as the diverse and often eccentric forms in which Masonry has developed itself in the different ages of the world. -4 I (I .1 V TWENTY-SIXTH DEGREE You now see upon the altar before you the luminous delta, with three equal sides, in all ages the representation of Deity, the trinity of wisdom, power, and harmony; and upon it the ineffable name, and the cross, in all time the emblem of eternity, with the Greek Letters J. . . . V. abbreviations of the name of Jesus Christ. The arrow, pressed against your right temple while you were obligated, and which is the emblem of authority of the presiding officer, is a symbol of eternal truth. And your symbolic age, 81 years, or the square of the square of three, will always remind you of the trinity. Receive now the P. V. & S. V. 2W. E.—My brethren, let us purify this our newly-adopted brother, and devote him to the service of God and virtue. A brother brings a cup of water; and the M. IE. pours a small quantity upon the head of the candidate, saying: M. E.—As the first Christian Masons, in the gloomy catacombs under the eternal city, baptized their initiates with pure water, as a symbol of regeneration, even so do I pour this water upon thy head as a symbol of that purification of the soul by suffering and sorrow, by which, parting with the stains of sins and the sordidness of vice, it becomes fit to return to its eternal home in the bosom of the Father who loveth all the children I-Ic hath made. Then a brother brings perfumed oil in a cup, and the M. E, dipping his linger in it, marks with it a tau cross upon the forehead of the candidate, saying: 2W. E.—By this sign I do devote thee henceforward to the cause of truth. [The si~atue is then unveited, and he continues.] Behold the Palladium of this Order. It is no image or idol to be wor - shiped; neither the Egyptian Isis, nor the Astarte of the Pho~ni - cians, nor Ceres, the symbol of nature, but an emblem of purity and truth—truth, which here we worship, and of which you are now the servant. A vessel, containing bread, and a vase, containing wine, are now placed upon the table in front of the throne; and the M. E. says: 2W. E.—Not an irreverent imitation of the rites of any church, nor as here assuming to administer any sacrament; but to renew I I"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"V. 298 TWENTY-SIXTH DEGREE our obligations of fraternal kindness, and to express our heartfelt~ gratitude to God for his beneficence and sure promises, let us eat and drink together. Each brother eats a morsel of the bicad, and drinks of the ~iine; and then the M. E. says: 2W. E.—Faith in God’s word, and a sincere reliance upon his loving kindness are the true bread of life; and good deeds and kindly affections are the wine that exalts the soul. Let these of which we have now partaken ever be symbols to us of faith and virtue, and remind us that we are the brethren of every true and upright Mason on the globe. The M. of C. now clothes the brother in a white tunic, and invests him with the apron, collar, and jewel, the M. E. saying: 2W. E.—My brother, the colors of this degree are green, red and white. They symbolize the Masonic trinity. The green is an emblem of the inilnite wisdom; the red of the supreme energy, force, or power; and the white, produced by mingling all the colors, of the divine harmony. On the three sides of the jewel you see the letters W. F. and H., the initials of the words Wisdom, Force, and harmony; and on the inflamed heart in the center, three letters which the Christian Mason reads as the initials of the phrase, Jesus Hominum Salvator. Perhaps you suspect that there is still remaining behind an inner meaning of the word “Trinity,’’ connecting itself with your title of Scottish Trinitarian. It may be so. Masonry discloses its secrets cautiously, and never makes the whole truth known at once. I receive you as one of the faithful and a Prince of Mercy; and I present you with this mark, called by the Romans, Tessera, which you will hereafter wear, as a proof that you are entitled to the privileges and honors of this degree. On one side of it you see the ineffable name, and on the other side the pass-word of the degree, in the cipher of the degree. You will never part with it, unless, being in need, you pledge it for a loan, to a brother of the degree, in which case he will retain it until the loan is repaid. He can not refuse the loan if it be asked for a pro~iier purpose, and when his own necessities do not require it, and if it be for a reasonable amount, and one within his means, and if the claims of his family or creditors do not demand that he shall be just before he is gener - II VA VV 299 TWENTY-SIXTH DEGREE ous; for in Masonry the legal maxim applies, nemo !iberalis nisi tib erat us.

Look well upon him, and afterward-inquire of each other as to his character and intelligence, that you may decide knowingly whether you will admit him to our ranks! . . . Brother Knight Draper, let the ap - plicant withdraw while the Knights Commanders deliberate. The M. of C. retires with the candidate, leaves him in the ante-room, and returns. When he has again taken his seat, the question of admitting the candidate is again taken up; and if any one desires information in regard to him, those who know him give it; after which the secret ballot is taken, and if it is unanimous, the E. C. directs that the ceremony proceed; and the M. of C. again repairs to the ante-room. The candidate is prepared by being clothed in a tunic of black stuff, on the left of which is a large white Teutonic Cross. He wears a sword of the degree, with the belt and scabbard black. The candi - date is then conducted by the M. of C. to a small room, the walls, ceiling, and floor of which arc entirely black. In the center of it is a small table, and by it L"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"TWENTY-SEVENTH DEGREE 306 307 TWEl4TY-S~VENTH DECREE a stool, both covered with black. On the table are three slmhhs, forming a triangle, with henfy twigs of evergreen shooting out from the several apertures of each. In the center of the triangle so formed is a single candle of black wax, burning. There is no other light. Also within th’fe triangle are three small vessels of silver, one near each skull, containing, respectively, a morseh of d~y biend, water, and salt. At one side is a printed paper, containing the questions, with spaces for the answers, and also letter-paper, with pens and ink, sealing wax, and a seal. Having seated the candidate upon the stool, the M. of C. says to him: 711. of 0.—My brother, you have asked to be permitted to receive the degree of Knight Commander of the Temple. Before you can do so, there are certain prerequisites with which you must comply. You will learn what they are by the printed paper on the table before you. I shall leave you alone. When you have counted sixty pulsations of the heart, remove the bandage from your eyes, eat of the bread, drink of the water, and taste of the salt, as a solemn pledge that you will answer and act, truly and with hono>-’Then read the paper, and do so. Consider well the solemn import of the questions and demands; let all around you, and especially the three mementoes on the table, remind you of the evanescence of all earthly things, and obligations of rectitude and honor, the cer - tainty of death, and after that of the resurrection, and solemn judgment for the deeds done in the body. When you shall have finished, sign the paper and give three distinct raps upon the table, and I will return. The M. of C. then retires, closing the door. The paper is as follows: “QUESTION 1. Ha-ye you done wrong or injury to any one, with - out atoning for it by repentance, and, if possible, by making amends?” “Qu~sThoN 2. You have often made professions and given pledges in Masonry. Now we demand of you performance. If you have done wrong or injury to any one, without making amends, and it has not now become impossible to do so, write to the party a letter, coilfessing the wrong, and promising to Inake amends, or doing so, if it can be done by letter! If you have atonement to make to more than one, answer whether, what you thus do in one ease you will at the earliest opportunity do in all! Seal, if you chooie, your letter, since we do not demand to know its contents; but answer briefly hereunder what you do and promise t ” “QUESTION 3.—Have you any enmity toward, or feud with, any one, that you would not readily abandon, if you found him sin- ‘i ~V cerely willing to be reconciled to you?’’ “QUEsTIoN 4. If you have any quarrel with. a good Mason of any degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, write to him now a letter offering reconciliation and the right hand of fellow - ship. Seal your letter; and answer what you have done; and, if you have more than one such quarrel, whether you will at the earliest opportunity do the same in every such case?” When the eandidate simmons the M. of C., the latter receives the paper, and the letters, if any, and again retires. The replies to the questions are then read aloud in the Chapter by the Chancellor; and the Knights consult to - gether in regard to their sufficiency. If the candidate should have refused to make atonement of an adniitted wrong, confessing that it is in his power to do so; or if he refuses to make advances toward a reconciliation with a brother of the Rite, it is not possible for him to be allowed to proceed; and in that case the M. of C. will conduct him to the aiite-room and so inform him, per- mating him to depart in peace. If be complies satisfactorily with what has been required, the ceremony will proceed. If it is thought proper to allow him orally to explain anything in his replies, lie may be introduced and per - mitted or requested to do so. In short, every means will be taken to know with certainty whether he is a true Mason, in this, that he is willing to atone for a wrong done any one, and not too proud to offer a reconciliation to a brother. If the Chapter is not satisfied, and ho is rejected, any letter he may have written will be returned to him. If he is received, his letter or letters will be handed to the Chancellor, to be forwarded to the parties to whom they are addressed. When it is decided that the candidate shall be admitted, the M. of C. conducts him to the door of the Chapter, places on his head a white linen coif, and close over that a red cap, and seats him there upon a how stool.

RECEPTION The candidate, having been duly elected, is prepared hy being clothed as Rose Croix, except the sword; or he may wear the order and jewel of any higher degree, below this. He is then told to enter the ante-room, where he finds three Aralim, one of whom is drawing designs on a board with chalk, another is doing the same with charcoal, and a third, with a pair of bellows, is blowing a fire, on which is an earthen pot or great orucitle, containing melted metal. These pay no attention to him, and do not answer, if he addresses them. After a few minutes, another Aral comes to him, and throws a thick black cloth over his head, completely blindfolding him, and then places him at the door of the Council-chamber, and tells him to knock six times, by three and three, and to answer truly such questions as may be asked him. On hearing the alarm, the Herald, who will be near the door, says: Iier.—Excellcnt Brother Truth, some one, having passed the guards, gives an unusual alarm at the door of the Council-chamber. Bro, T.—Vcnerablc Father Adam, some one having passed the guard, gives an unusual alarm at the door of the Council-chamber. Father A.—Let the Herald ascertain who makes the alarm, and, if it be the aspirant, ask him the necessary questions. The Herald goes to the door, opens it slightly and asks: Her.—Who hails? Cand.—A Knight Rose Croix and Commander of the Temple. Her.—What is your name? Cancl.—A. .. . B. ... H’er.—Do you desire to approach the great light? Oancl.—I do. IIer.—Are you prepared to receive instruction with humility, to allow your prejudices and wrong opinions to be overcome by reason, and to listen with reverence to the lessons of the ancient sages? Cancl.—I am. lIer.—Can you look hereafter with pitying sympathy on the diseases of the spirit and the intellect, as you do on those of the body; and not with hatred or anger, or a desire to punish or to persecute? Is. Vi— 14 -V i~4 Is~ 14 44- TWENTY-EIGHTH DEGREE 323 Cand.—I can. Her.—Are you willing hereafter to write the favors done you on the marble, the injuries upon the sands? Oancl.—I am. Her.—Wait, then, with patient cheerfulness, until the Venerable Master and the brethren are informed of your desire and your responses, and until their decision is made known. The Herald closes the door, and reports to the Warden: Her.—Excellent Brother Truth, the aspirant has answered in the affirmative all the necessary questions. Bro. T.—Vcnerable Father Adam, the aspirant has answered in the affirmative all the necessary questions. Father A.—Since such is the case, Excellent Brother Truth, let him be admitted, and received according to the ancient ceremony. One of the Aralim, acting as Master of the Ceremonies, goes out, takes the aspirant by the right hand, and leads him into the chamber. Two others have in the meantime stationed themselves near the door, each armed with a drawn sword. As soon as the aspirant enters, Brother Truth cries in a loud, harsh tone: Bro. T.—Halt! The two armed brethren immediately place the points of their swords against the aspirant’s right and left breasts, and the Herald ties his hands behind him with a cord. Bro. T.—Nature is revelation; and the light of truth shines everywhere in the world. The want of faith, and the refusal to reason, of men, interposing, make the shadows. Man is blindfolded by himself. Magism, which the ancients called the Sanctum Reg - num, or Holy Empire, or the kingdom of Deity, is made for kings and priests alone. Are you a priest? Are you a king? Have you the capacity, the energy, the courage, and the knowledge to teach and to rule other men? The priesthood of Magism is not an ordi - nary priesthood, and its royalty has no controversy with the princes of this world. He who is in love with his own ideas, and dreads to lose them; he who fear new truths, and is not disposed to doubt every - thing rather than admit anything at random, should not seek to learn the lessons of this degree.

You will not comprehend the secrets which a few only understand, and which these few will not reveal. To show the light to birds of night is to conceal it from them, since it blinds them, and is darker to them than the darkness. Behind thee is the outer world; before thee the unknown; art thou still resolute to advance? Gand —I am. The aspirant is conducted to the altar, and placed near it, on the west of it, facing the East. Brother T. now says to him: Bro. T—My brother, you stand before the altar of obligation of the Princes of the True Science, Adepts and Knights of the Sun. We do not ask you whether your judgment and reason assent to all you have heard. If you are merely undecided and in doubt, you may properly proceed.

The Malakoth form the inner circle, leaving space on the east side for Father A., Brother T., and the aspirant; and the Aralini form a circle around them. Father A. and Brother T. leave their stations and repair to the altar, and, taking the aspirant be - tween them, complete the circle. The M. of C. bears in his hand a gilded cup containing salt, and stands on the right of Father A. When the circles are formed, Father A. says: Father A.—My brother, among the ancient Arabians, who were our earliest masters, even an enemy, with whom one had tasted salt, was sae~ed, and his person inviolable. In imitation of those whose fathers remembered the flood, we continue the ancient ceremony, and with it seal our most solemn pledges. After Vi 4 iat ancient cus - tom we shall now pledge you faith and brotherhood, and require of you the final obligation. The M. of C. hands the cup to the Master, who places upon his tongue, and swallows, a little of salt, saying: ‘‘I will be true and loyal to this brother. So HzLP M~ GOD!” He then hands the cup to the M. of C., who does and says the same; each Malak does and says the same in turn, and then Brother T.; and the cup is then handed to one of the Arahim, all of whom perform the same ceremony.

Were ray lordship of Galilee and my principality Tiberias both sokl, I could not pay it.

Go back to France; thou needst not part with thy prin - cipality or lordship—I will win them of thee hereafter with the sword. So noble a knight is too valuable to his countrymen to be allowed thus to lose his life. There is no knight or Christian that will not give thee liberal aid towards thy ransom. But if you should fail, give me your knightly word, that, at the end of two years from this day, and at this hour, you will present yourself to me again, and surrender your head to the executioner. 0. M.—Most noble and princely Saladin! truest of knights thy - self in spirit, I accept thy terms, with ten thousand thanks for thy generous confidence; and I pledge my knightly word—never yet given to man or woman and afterwards broken—that, if I do not’ pay the~ansom, I will, at’this very hour, two years hence, present myself before you to die without a murmur. And this, moreover, by my holy vows of knighthood do I solemnly swear; and may God have mercy on me only if I keep this oath and promise, if death or sickness do not prevent. Al. of 0.—Noble Emir of Emessa, return this brave knight his sword and armor. Give him a horse of the breed called the winged, and send him, with a sufficient escort, after he hath eaten with us, to the Christian army. Malek Adhel, Sayf-eddin, see that he hath passports that may insure his safety. S. W.—King of kings, I hear and obey. ‘5’ 5’ H TWENTY~NINTH DEGREE 0. M.~Princely Saladin, I thank thee most gratefully; and all Christendom shall know how nobly thou hast dealt with me. Per - mit me, now, to retire and prepare for my journey—since, by my faith, the hundred thousand besants require me to be stirring, and will allow me but scant rest for the next two years. Al. of 0.—Thou hast permission, Knight. The noble Emir will go with you and see you prepared at all points for your journey. G.M. bows and retireS, but as he passes out at the door, the M. of C. says: Al. of 0.~Malek Afdel, my son, recall the Frankish Knight; I would speak with him again. J. Th goes out and returns with the 0. M., who again approaches the East, and awaits the Sultan’s pleasure. Noble Knight, since your forces entered this land of ours, I have learned something of your institution of Knighthood, and would fain know more. I understand the sanctity of the knightly word, as you may see by the confidence I have placed in yours; and I have also heard from those who have been in your camps, as pris - oners and otherwise, that there is among you a strange equality, so that a knight, though poor, may sit in the presence of a monarch. Tell me if that be so. 0. M.—It is. Thou hast not been misinformed. The name of Knight, and gentle blood, entitle the possessor to place himself in the same rank with sovereigns of the first degree, so far as regards all hut kingly authority and dominion. If the greatest king were to wound the honor of the poorest knight, he could not, by the law of chivalry, refuse satisfaction by single combat. Al. of 0.—And how may he aspire to mate in marriage? U. M.—With the noblest and proudest dame in Christendom. The poorest knight is free, in all honorable service, to devote his hand and sword, the fame of his exploits, and the deep devotion of his heart, to the fairest princess that ever wore a coronet. Al. of 0.—And hath the Order of Knighthood other eKeellencies? 0. M.—It demands the strictest honor and most sacred regard to truth; it requires us to protect the defenseless and the innocent; it inculcates purity and virtue, patience, firmness, self~goveTnment, and, in short, that the true knight and gentleman shall be alike without fear and without reproach. Al. of 0.—Prince of Tiberias, thou owest me return for the favor"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"TWENTY-NINTH DEGREE 5- 336 So 5’- I have done thee, and I ask of thee a boon. I pray thee, in the name of Allah, that thou wilt make known to me the sacred laws of the Order of Knighthood and confer upon me that dignity, before your departure, for I am ready to conform to its requirements. 0. Al. jjAfter hesitating] —It is impossible. Al. of 0.—How impossible ?—make known to me the reasons. I would fain receive as a willing gift that which I might extort. 0. Al.—Thou rulest many nations, Salad-eddin. For every arrow thou sendest by a messenger, ‘tis said that two-score thousand riders mount on horseback, and for the bow, as many as thou hast asked me besants for my ransom. But I tell thee that, mighty as thou art, thou bast not the power to force a true and loyal Knight to do an act dishonorable or forbidden by the rules of knighthood. Al. of 0.—I crave thy pardon, noble Knight, for the inconsid - erate threat—for is it not true that the thing one gains only by compulsion is of little value I I would entreat thee, courteously, and as an equal, to do me this great favor. Thou sayest it is impos - sible—but why ‘0. Al.—Thou canst not be made a Knight without bending thy knee before me, and my sword must be laid upon thy person. Al. of 0.—Do I not kneel in prayer even as the humblest believer? 0. Al—Thou must profess thy belief in the one true and ever- living God: and ye Saracens worship not the true God. Al. of 0.—Thou art mistaken, Prince, for thou knoxvest not our faith. Dost uot the Koran say, “There is no God but God—the living, the self-subsisting”? Your God is our God; there is no God but He—the most merciful. To God belongeth the East and the West—therefore, whithcrsoever ye turn yourselves to pray, there is the face of God; for God is omnipresent and omniscient. We believe in God and that which hath been sent down to us, and that which hath been sent unto Abraham and Ishmaci, and Isaac and Jacob, and the tribes; and that which was delivered unto Moses and Jesus; and that which was delivered unto the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to God we are resigned. So speaketh the Koran everywhere. G. M.—Princely Saladin, didst thou ever think of the Lord Jesus Christ, or dost thy faith allow thee to believe in him? Al. of 0—Dost not the Koran say that whosoever behieveth in God and the last day, and doeth that which is right, shall have —S TWgNTY-NINTH DEGREE 337 their reward with their Lord? Doth it not say, “We formerly delivered the Book of the Law unto Moses, and caused apostles to succeed him, and give evident miracle to Jesus, the Son of Mary, and strengthened him with the holy Spirit? The angels said, “0 Mary, verily God hath chosen Thee—verily God sendeth Thee the good’ tidings, that Thou shalt bear the word, proceeding from Him - self; his name shall be Christ Jesus; God shall teach Him the scripture and wisdom, and the law and the gospel, and shall -ap point Him his apostle to the children of Israel. God took Him up unto Himself and God is mighty and wise. And there shall not be one of those who have received the Scriptures who shall not believe in Him before his death; and on the day of resurrection He shall be a witness against them”? These are the words of the Koran; and all the followers of the Prophet believe that Christ was an apostle from Ood, born of a Virgin and inspired, and did teach the truth. 0. Al.—Sayeth the Koran these things, and dost thou believe them? Al. of 0.—It sayeth them, and I believe them. I also believe that the Prophet was an apostle, sent to preach the truth—the prim - itive true religion, revealed by God to Abraham. I believe in Christ, but thou dost not believe in Mahomet. We worship no idols, but the one true God, who was the God of Abraham, and who sent Christ Jesus to teach his truth to the Jews. 0. Al.—What knightly virtues dost the Koran enjoin upon those who believe its doctrines? Al. of 0.—” Serve God, associate no creature -with Him; and show kindness unto parents and relations, and orphans and the poor, and your neighbor who is of kin to you, and also your neighbor who is a stranger, and to your familiar companion and the traveler, and the captives whom your right hand shall possess—for God loveth not the proud or vain-glorious, who are covetous. 0 true believer, be patient and constant-minded, and fear God, that ye may be happy.” Such, and others like them, are the words written on all the pages of the Koran. The word of a Moslem is never broken; and he who is intemperate, unchaste, cruel, the violator of inno - cence, covetous, or base, offends against the laws of the Prophet. ‘0. Al.—Princely Salab-eddin, I consent; and would that all thy court were such as thee—as noble—and believed as thou dost. Al. of 0.—Most noble Knight, in all thy kindness, I would crave"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"338 TWENTY-NINTH DEGREE another boon—in that my warmest friend and most intimate coun - selor, first of all my court—Malek Daber, now at my right hand— may bear me companionship in assuming holy vows, that, with me, in future life, by sweetness of counsel and interchange of mind, we may maintain a truer and more steadfast course in the fulfill. ment of knightly vows. 0. ~lf.—Thy wish shall be gratified; and may Ibe pardoned if in this I err. Go with me, then, alone; for none must witness our solemn ceremony, that shall confer the rank and honors of knight - hood. Al. of C.—Salah-eddin, my brother, assume my stathn until I return, and let the business of the court proceed. Let none depart until my reappearance. M. of C. descends from the throne with the candidate, and retires with the G. M. to the Second Apartment, in which are x~ater in a basin and napkins. 0. Al.—Tli’~ rules of knighthood strictly require that the beard of the novitiate shall be shaven smooth and his hair trimmed, but the literal performances of these rites may be dispensed with under circumstances that require it. I, therefore, as a representa - tive of that ceremony, cut lightly of each—yielding to your rank and the customs of your country. You will now wash both hands and face, which, with the cere - monies performed, is a symbol of that baptismal rite observed among all Eastern nations, by way of purification—emblematical of that purity and innocence of soul, without which no one can enter into the Order of Knighthood nor into the pure abode of happiness above. The candidate for knighthood not only serves a long app ren - ticeshipcin arms, and shows himself valiant and daring, and above all base apprehension of death, but should pass tkrough a long and rigid probation, to prove himself, by his virtue, temperance, faith, constancy, and nobleness of heart, fit to be enrolled in the ranks of Chivalry. These, under circumstances, may be dispensed with, and the Order conferred even upon the field. I do enjoin both of you, if you are not resolved to be hence- forward virtuous, chaste, humble before God, merciful, tolerant, generous, and charitable, to proceed no further, lesi hereafter you should be disgraced before the whole world as false and disloyal Knights.

Aid them to be true and loyal, frank and ~incere; and may their knighthood here below be but preparatory to their final initiation into the mysteries of thy heaven of perfect happiness and perfect purity. Amen! 0. Al.—Noble Salah-eddin, thou has knelt to God in prayer. Thou must kneel yet again to me, as the representative of all the Orders of Knighthood. But, first, it is necessary that you take upon yourselves a most solemn obligation, before I can reveal to you the secrets of the Order of Knighthood, which I am about to confer upon you. I will bind you to nothing unworthy of your - selves, or contrary to your faith., or at variance with your duties to your household, yourselves, the Moslem people, or your God.

Be valiant, true, and vir - tuous—Arise! MEANING OF THIS DEGREE 0. 0.—Masonry is the handmaid of religion. The Brahmin, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Christian—each professing his peculiar religion, sanctioned by the laws, by time, and by climate, may retain their faith, and yet may be Masons. Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenets of the old primitive faith, which underlie and are the founda - tion of all religions. Masonry is the universal morality which is suitable to the inhabitants of every clime, to the man of every creed, No man truly obeys the Masonic law who merely tolerates those whose religious opinions are opposed to his own. Every man s opinions are his ov.~n private property, and the rights of all men to maintain each his own are perfectly equal. Merely to tolerate, to bear with an opposing opinion, is to assume it to be heretical, and assert the right to persecute, if we would, and claim our toleration as a merit. The Mason’s creed goes further than that; no man, it holds, has any right, in any way, to interfere with the religious belief of another. It holds that each man is absolutely sovereign as to his own belief, and that belief is a matter absolutely foreign to all who do not entertain the same belief; and that if there were any right of persecution at all, it would in all cases be a mutual right, because one party has the same right as the other to sit as judge in his own case—and God is the only magistrate that can rightfully decide between them. To that Great Judge Masonry refers the matter; and, opening wide its portals, it invites to enter there, and live in peace and harmony, the Christian, the Jew, the Moslem—every one who will lead a truly virtuous and moral life, love his brethren, minister to the sick and distressed, and believe in the One, All-Powerful, All- Wise, Everywhere-Present God—Architect, Creator, and Preserver of all things—by whose universal law of Harmony ever rolls on this Universe: the great, vast, infinite circle of successive death and life; to whose ineffable name let all true Masons pay profoundest homage! for whose thousand blessings poured upon us let us feel the sincerest gratitude, now, henceforth, and forever.

Corn.—My brother, before you can proceed any farther, it is indispensably necessary that you pass over the m3rsterious Ladder you see before you; it will serve to instruct you in the mysteries of our Order, and the lessons taught by it, make a deep and lasting impression on the mind, and prove beneficial to you in the journey through life; it is the only way and entrance into our Order. It has seven steps, which inculcate the virtues you should practice; THIRTIETH DEGREE IS, V V S 353 it has also two supports; the one on the right is called “Oheb Etoah,” the one on the left “Oheb Kerobo.” You will now mount the first step of the mystic Ladder and contract a further obligation.

Oand.—I promise and swear. Knights—Swear! 0. Oorn.—Now say with me the word, on the first step, “Tseda - kah,” that is, Justice, Uprightness, because upon Justice must be based all our actions; for a true Knight K—h, when called upon to punish, must not forget that Justice is inviolate. You -will now ascend the second step. 0. B. N. I promise and swear to exercise candor in all my actions, and to never receive to this sublime degree of Knights K—h any one of whose life and character I am not fully satisfied, nor then without the consent of one Inspector-General of the thirty-third degree, unless he shall be received into a regularly constituted Consistory of Sovereign Princes of the Royal Secret.

Cand.—I promise and swear. Knights—Swear! 0. Corn.—Say after me, “Mat hoc,” that is Meekness; this virtue, so valuable in the profane world, is still more necessary in the Knight K—h; for it is by this virtue only, that we may hope to convince erring brethren and induce them to enter the path of true happiness and liberty. You ‘will now ascend the fourth step. 0. B. N. I promise and swear to regulate my conduct, and walk in life by truth and justice, and to keep great care and circumspection over the degree of Knight K—h from the profane and unworthy. Cand.—I promise and swear. Knights—Swear! 0. Corn—Say affer me, ‘Ernounah,” that is, Fidelity, Stead - iness; you easily understand how precious this quality is in a Knight K—h. There can be no success for him if he is not faithful to his obligations—if he is lukewarm in fulfilling his duty. Ascend now the fifth step. 0. B. N. I promise and swear, in my travels through life, to keep the advancement of the cause of heaven in view, and to follow, so far as in my power, the rules and regulations of the Order for the goveriiThent of the Knights Kadosh and those of the Consistory of Sovereign Princes of the Royal Secret, in whose jurisdiction I am, so far as they may come to my knowledge.

And if labor is necessary for man in the walks of life, it is still more so for a Knight Kadosh, who must not rest so long as the welfare of humanity is not defin - itely secured. THIRTIETH DEGREE I promise and swear to have patience in adversity, and never to receive to this degree, on any pretense whatever, any brother whose will is not perfectly free, such as religious monks, and all others who have bowed, without restriction, submissive to a superior power or body.

We have to undergo many trials—many dangers threaten us—and we must never be taken by surprise. We must a] ways be united, and for that purpose we must forgive our brethren their errors and their faults, if we wish them to forgive us. You will now ascend the seventh step. 0. B. N. I promise and swear to keep secret what has been or may be communicated to me relative to this sublime degree. I also promise, if the two orders of Knights Templar and Knights of Malta should at any time be arrayed in arms against each other, for the restora - tion of the 9rder, or for the defense of their rights, and it shall become necessary for me to take an active part, that I ~vill espouse the cause of the Knights Templar, and renounce the Order of Malta, and regard them as unjust usurpers of the rights, titles, and digni - ties of Knights Templar. Cand.—I promise and swear. Knights—Swear! 0. Corn.—You will now say after me, “Shernoul,” “Binah,” “Thebounah,” that is, Generosity, Intelligence, Prudence; and in - deed, my brother, this must be the last step of Perfection. A generous man is always ready to sacrifice himself for the bene - fit of his brethren. An intelligent man studies the secrets of nature, and draws therefrom all that can promote human happiness. A prudent man does not waste his resources, and never trusts to hazard. He is very cautious, so that xvhen the time comes for execu - tion, every circumstance may contribute to the success of our Holy cause. These virtues, springing from love of God and love of our neigh - bor, constitute the ne plus ultra of Masonic perfection. —S ‘S ‘‘‘I —S"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THIF~T]ETH DEGREE 357 356 THIRTIETH DEGREE My brother, on the other side of the Lad~er are written the names of those sciences which all men sincerely desiring to help their fellow-men must study; they are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy.

ROAD TO THE HOLY LAND The two following incidents should be dramatized by a mem - her of the Consistory taking the part of the Candidate. First Incident. The candidate commences his travels alone, and encounters a weaiy and hungry pilgrim, with dress and staff, unable to support himself without the aid of his stick; his gait is slow, and his body half bent from fatigue and hunger. Pilgrim—Sir traveler! for the love of heaven stop and hear me. I am a poor weary pilgrim traveling from afar, and journeying to the Holy Land, to offer up my devotions at the holy shrine. I am poor and needy, and require assistance; my means are exhausted; and if relief is not obtained I must lie down and die. Cand.—What aid do you require? Pil.—I need money, food and wine. Candidate supplies aid. Pil.—Thanks! Thanks, kind friend! You have imparted new life to me. He eats ravenously, or so acts, and says: Pil.—I shall now be able to resume my journey. May the bless - ing of Him who preached charity to the world rest upon you during your journey through life. Then, farewell! He whose virtues and example I wish to emulate has taught us that the greatest of all virtues is charity; that it is better to give than to receive; you have the means and will not relieve me. Go! and may heaven in its infinite mercy he[p you. When the candidate again starts on his journey, the pilgrim will silently retire. Second Incident. A monk, by the roadside, is dressed as such, with a cowl or broad-brimmed hat, sides turned up so that the rim projects far forward and behind; a cross is hanging at his side. The monk is a clandestine Mason and bad man, who, unable to obtain a true knowledge of the mysteries, accosts every person he imagines to be a Mason, and endeavors to draw from tbem a revelation. He is at times insidious and jesuitical; at other times vindictive and revengeful. Monk—Ha! my brother, well met; valiant and glorious Knight of the Temple!

Come, join me. Candidate answers. Monk—Who gave you the Order? Let me know, that I may get him to assist me? Candidate answers. Monk—Y, 7 hy not? I am a monk bound to religious duties, to which you are also bound. Is it not so? Who assisted in giving you the degrees? He may be a friend of mine. Candidate answers. Monk—I know I am a stranger to you, but we are brothers. I can satisfy you by signs and words. You have signs and words, have you not? Be not thus cold; let us be friends; give me the sign of a Templar, that we may travel as such. Candidate answers. Mon~k~—Give it me, I say! I have gold in ~identy. I will not wait for the slow and uncertain movement of your council, nor will I abide its formalities of initiation.

Purs.—Hath he, by sufficient service and patient obedience as a Mason, learned the first lesson in the art of governing? Def.—IIe hath; he has learned to govern himself. - Purs.—Is he true and trustworthy? Is he honest, temperate, of equal temper, charitable of judgment, and of merciful impulses? Def.—He is a Knight Kadosh, and his brethren have thought him not unworthy to be admitted here. - Purs.—You will wait the pleasure of the Supreme Tribunal. “-4 This dialogue is repeated by the Pursuivant and M.

Grand Chancellor—Most Perfect President, I propose that the vacancy in our Supreme~Tribunal be filled, and if there is no more pressing business before us, that we proceed so to do immediately. Al. P. Pres.—ls it the will of the Illustrious Judges’? Judges—Aye. Def.—Most Perfect President, I propose, as a suitable candi - ‘date, to fill the vacancy, our newly-admitted Knight on my right. I believe him to possess all the qualifications necessary to fill that distinguished station. 1st Knight—I fear that the newly-admitted brother has not suf - ficient experience and practice in the rules and duties of our Order to be a competent judge of the malefactions of others. 2d Knight—Most Perfect President, I protest! I understand that the Knight has been accused of having violated some portion of his 0-b-n, voluntarily assumed on the mysterious ladder, by (re - vealing sign or word, etc.) Def.—Most Perfect President, rumors and reports are not proofs; are there any witnesses to prove this accusation? 3rd Knight—Most Perfect President, a Monk has reported that on threatening him, the Knight Kadosh gave him the pass-word of a Knight.

Permission being granted, the Def. retiree, and returns with pilgrim, to whom the accusation is stated by M. P. President. Pilgrim—Illustrious Sir, I know this worthy Knight, and was witness to the assault made upon him by the Monk of whom you speak; the Monk first used gentle words and means, and then threats and violence to extort from the Knight some of the secrets of his Order, but in vain.

There being no further business before this Supreme Tribunal, and thanking you for your counsels, you are dismissed. Illustrious Brother Defender, you will now present the newly-elected Judge before me. Judges quietly retire; table removed, and lights lit, etc. Al. P. Pres.—Illustrious Knight, you desire to take upon your - self an arduous, responsible office. There is but one infallible, un - erring Judge. All human judgment is, at best, uncertain; serious in its consequences, it must often, when time develops its errors, pro - duce regret, and sometimes remorse. It is not wise to seek to judge our fellow-man; it is a stern duty, and an unwelcome task to be performed, and not a privilege to he coveted; and woe unto that man who assumes the prerogative of judgment, and, to some extent, nsurps the functions of God, not being himself just, upright, im - partial! Does your heart tell you that you may safely assume that power? Candidate—It does. Al. P. Pres.—It is well, Illustrious Knight, if, indeed, you be not deceived; go with your guide; heed well the lessons and the warn - ings you will receive, and return again to me. The Def. conducts the candidate once around the Tribunal, and halts at the column of Alfred, when he is addressed as follows: A Knight—I was the just King Alfred of Saxon, England; I frame~I wise laws, made upright judges, independent of my will and that of the people, and caused just and speedy judgment to he given. In all my realm, justice and right were sold to none; denied to none; delayed to none. I slept little; I wrote much; I studied more. I reigned only to bless those over whom I had do - minion. I have vanished into the thin past, and many ages have marched in solemn procession by my grave, yet I still live in the memory of men. They call me great king, wise law-giver, just judge; follow, then, my example, or shudder to sit in judgment on thy fellow. 371 A Kt.—I was Socrates, the Athenian; I knew the holy mysteries, and reverenced God in nature. In the sacred groves of Athens, I taught to young and old that God was one, and the soul of man immortal. I taught obedience to the laws and decrees of the people of Athens, and the council of five hundred. When I sat in the court of the Areopagus I swore by the paternal Apollo, by Ceres, and by Jupiter the King, that I would sentence uprightly and according to law; or, when the law was silent, to the best of my judgment; and that I would not receive gifts, nor should any other for me; nor receive - bribes from any passion, prejudice, or affection; nor allow any other person to do the like by any means, whether direct or indirect, to prevent justice in the court. And when, by an unjust judgment, the same court condemned mc to death I refused to flee and escape, lest I should bring the laws into disrepute; holding the good citizen bound to submit to even the unjust judgment of the state. If thou wouldst fain become a judge of others, first prepare thyself by learning to obey the laws. Def. conducts the cand[date to the column of Confucius. A Kt.—I was Confucius, who read and interpreted to the people of Ancient China the great laws engraved by the finger of God, in everlasting letters, upon the pages of the many-leaved hook of nature. I said to them, Desire not for your country any other benefit than justice; the great law of duty is to he looked for in humanity. “Justice is Equity,” to render to every man that to which he is entitled. He who would stand above the ordinary level of man must be exempt from prejudices and self-conceit and ob - stinacy, and be governed by the mandates of justice alone. Hear much, reflect much, and say nothing superfluous. Let doubt of guilt be acquitted; and presumption of innocence he solid proof. “That is the noblest recompense of human virtue!” Do thou strive so to live and act; to obey and govern; and thou, too, mayest live in the good opinion of men, after thou art dead, and thine influences may make thee, too, a king over the minds of men. Def. conducts the candidate to the column of Minos. A Kt.—I was Minos, the law giver of Crete. I taught the Crc - tans that the laws which I enacted were dictated by Zeus, the father; for all true and righteous laws, and alt human justice, are hut developments of that eternal and infinite justice, that is of the essence of Deity.

Def. conducts the candidate to the column of Zoroaster. A Kt.—I was Zoroaster, whose words became law to the Persians. I said, He is the best servant of God whose heart -is upright, who is liberal, with due regard to what is just to all men; who turns not his eyes toward riches, and whose heart wishes well to everything that lives, He alone is just who is charitable, and merciful in his judgments; and he alone is wise who thinks well, and not evil, of other men. Satisfy thine own conscience, and fear neither the out - rages of fortune nor the injuries of enemies. Crime is not to be measured by the issue of events, but by the bad intentions of the doers. Study, therefore, the dominion of thyself, and quiet thine own commotions, and hold it the noblest ovation to triumph over thy passion. Def. conducts the candidate to the column of Moses. A Kt.—I was Moses, the leader and law-giver of the Israelites. I was initiated into the mysteries and wisdom of Ancient Egypt; and that wisdom dictated the statutes by which Israel was governed. Thou shalt take no gift; for the gift bindeth the wise and perverteth the words of the righteous. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judg - ment. Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty. Ye shall hear the small as well as the great. Ye shall not fear the face of man; for judgment is of God. Def. now conducts the candidate to the Counselors, when the Sen. Couns. says: Sen. Couns.—Thou hast heard the words o~ the great sages, law - givers and philosophers of antiquity. Behold! [Pointing to the Word over his headl, the symbol of the greatest law-giver that has ever come among men, and listen reverentially to his teachings. If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgi~c your trespasses. But if ye forgive men their tres - passes, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you. With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged. And with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. If thy brother tres• 4 -I- pass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent forgive him; and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to the saying, “I repent,” thou shalt forgive him. Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy. Def. conducts the candidate to the East. Al. P. Pres.—Be seated, my brother. M. of Cer. seats him in front of the M. P. Pres. You have heard the lessons of immortal wisdom, once uttered by mortal lips that have long since mouldered into dust. Through those lips God spake unto men; for of Him alone cometh all wisdom. You desire to become a member of this Tribunal, and a Supreme Judge in Masonry. The consistory, satisfied with your capacity and qualifications, with your impartiality and justice, has, in its wisdom, granted your request. In every case submitted to your judgment, and, whether the matter and the parties be Masonic or profane, you must hear affably, deliberate calmly, and yield to no other influ - ences than those~of “Justice and Equity,’’ th& sacred words of this degree. Do you feel that it is in your power so to perform those duties? Rise and answer. The candidate, rising, says: Cand.—I do. Al. P.

Illustrious Master of Cere - monies, conduct the candidate to the camp of the Masonic army, and let him study its symbolism. The M. of C. now places the candidate between the camps and the two Lieutenants, still facing the C.-in-C. The M. of C. stands with candidate. Then the Master of Ancient Craft Lodge and the Thrice Potent Master place themselves south of altar facing north, while the Most Wise Master, the Soy - ereiga Prince and the Chancellor place themselves north of the altar facing south. Each wears the regalia of his particular office. ~II. of C.—My brother, the thirty-second degree of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, which we are now conferring on you, is the military organization, as the thirty-first degree is the judicial organization of the Order. The Camp which you are approaching and its several parts are all symbols, the meaning of which we will endeavor to explain to you. The external lines of the camp form a V nonagon, or a figure of Geometry with nine equal sides. You per - ceive that on each side of the nonagon is a tent with a flag and pennon; that each flag and its pennon are of a different color from the others, and that each tent is designated by a letter. SEach repre - sents a camp and the several sides of the nonagon are the Masons of the different degrees. The nonagon also encloses a heptagon, V within whose lines is a pentagon which in turn encloses a triangle in the center of which is a circle. Thus do we find the mystic numbers 3, 5, 7, and 9, all emanating from the circle of infinity, and as these numbers symbolize Divine attributes, and Masonic principles, so should Masonic Labor emanate from Divine love, be directed by Divine wisdom, and be exercised in Divine power for the blessing of men and the glory of God. The third emanation from Infinity is denoted by the pentagon, each angle of which represents a di - vision of the Scottish Rite Army. Take heed while their attributes are now rehearsed. M. of C. at first angle of camp, and facing candidate: Al. of C.—The first angle represents the Symbolic Lodge wherein are given the first lessons in Masonry.

Herein are taught those duties toward our brother whose perform - ance leads steadily toward a knowledge of God. We learn that selfish endeavor defeats itself and debases the man who engages in it. We are taught that by united labor foy the good of all Humanity is advanced toward the ineffable mystery wherein all should be perfect.

PIJALALKOL, it is said, means SEPARATED. Separated—as Alasons have been for many years, by intestine dissensions, the jeal - ousies of rival Rites, and the efforts of illegitimate Bodies to exercise usurped power. Separated—as Alankind has been for ages, by differ - ences of religious belief, by the ambition and interests of kings, by natural lines or mere imaginary boundaries that have made one people haters of another, and kept the world miserable with wars. Separated—as Alen have been from Truth and Knowledge, by the arts and craft of the scheming and selfish ministers of the Altars of Religion. Separated—as Alan has been from God, by his passions and his vices, as well as his ignorance; And PIJARASKOL, it is said, means REUNITED; that UNION of Masons, of all degrees, of which the Camp is the apt and fitting symbol, to accomplish the great euffs of Masonry; to heal all dis - sensions within, and produce peace and harmony without; to recon - cile all Rites and make toleration and charitable judgment univer - sal to elevate the masses of Mankind, and teach them their true interesi~ to substitute Equality and Brotherhood in the place of despotic Powe~\\and usurped Privilege; to dethrone Anarchy and License, and canonize Law and Order; and in the place of the smoking altars of Fanaticism and Superstition, of Bigotry and Sec - tarianism to set up those of True Masonry, garlanded with flowers, and sending up toward Heaven, mingled with the perfumes of their incense, the thanks and gratitude of the Human race to a Bene - ficent Father who lovetli ALL the children He has made.
