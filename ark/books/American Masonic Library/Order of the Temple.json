The first three degrees of Masonry inculcate the cardinal virtues, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice. Charity was taught you as a Mark Master, Moderation as a Past Master, your industry was rewarded as a Most Excellent Master, and when you passed under the Living Arch you received a lesson in humility. When you were created a Companion of the Red Cross you were impressed with the almighty force and the importance of Truth. When you were admitted a Knight of Malta you were instructed to be zealous and vigilant for the honor of Knighthood. While the world is shut out, meditate upon these things, and prepare your heart for the solemn ceremonies through which you will be called to pass.

In childish innocence he played; along the paths of youth he strayed. Having like us, his hopes and fears; His hours of joy, perchance of tears. And when to man’s estate he grew; The feelings we know, he knew. We know not where or when he wrought; What visions dreamed, what aims he sought. Ambitions call he may have heard; Mayhap, his heart by love was stirred. Or a greed of gold he may have felt; Or at the shrine of passion knelt. This much we know, and nought beside; That he was born and lived and died. It may have been his lot to toil; to delve in mines or till the soil. He may have sailed the trackless seas; or felt the heat of dessert breeze. Or a priestly grab he may have worn; or weight of public office borne. But poor or priestly, rich or great; he came at last to this sad estate. With reverence then, behold with me; Tha t which we all must sometime be, And as we near the dread abyss Of death, when we shall be like this, But unto those whose faith remains, Death does not sever earthly chains, Our spirit freed from this poor clod, Is but to sleep, to wake with GOD.
