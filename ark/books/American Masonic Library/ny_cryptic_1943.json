S.—Companion Adoniram, it grieves me to inform you that I cannot now com - ply with my promise, nor suitably reward your long and faithful service by com - municating to you the M. W. The word can only be given in the presence of three. Since my promise was made a great calamity has befallen the Craft. Grand Master El. A., as you are aware, has fallen, a martyr to his trust, the vic - tim of a foul assassination. Neither the M. W. nor a key to it was found on or about the body, and by his death I fear the M. W. is forever lost. You must re - main content with a substitute. C. C.—lll. King Solomon, your words recall to my mind a conversation I had with G. M. H. A. just prior to his death. On a certain day near high twelve • I carried up a piece of work for his in - spection. When the Craft was called from labor to refreshment I did not retire with the rest but lingered behind that I might speak to our Grand Master after he should have concluded his devotions and drawn • his designs upon the trestle board. When G. M. H. A. was passing out by way of the South Gate I accosted him and asked when I might expect to receive the M. W. He replied that it was uncertain that I would ever receive it, as the M. W. could only be communicated when the Temple should be completed and then only in the presence of your Majesty, your illustrious Companion of Tyre and himself. Whereup - on 11 said, “Suppose that one of you three, even you yourself, should be removed by death prior to that event, how shall I then receive it ?“ He did not immediately reply, but remained for a few moments in deep meditation, and then taking me by the arm, we walked slowly around the Temple I 24 25"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"courts three times. As we walked he dis - coursed in the most solemn manner on the subject of death, but assured me that even though he should be tal~en hence the M. W. would not be lost, and each time as we came opposite the East Gate he struck the ground and, pointing down - ward, said, “If I die, it will be buried there.” The Craft was soon after called to la - bor, and I returned to my work; nor did I ever again have an opportunity to con - verse with him upon ths subject. K. S.—Your story is fraught with deep meaning, Comp. Adoniram, and the in - formation you have furnished is of the highest import. My worthy Comp. of Tyre, how may we suitably reward Ado niram for the discreet silence he has observed regarding the dis - closures just made as well as for his long and faithful service? H. K. T.—lll. K. Solomon, the faithful service of Adoniram, as well as the com - mendable discretion he has exhibited, should not go unrewarded, and as we can - not communicate to him the M. W., I pro - pose that he be elevated to the rank of Inspector of Works, in place of him whose death we now mourn ; and, as such posi - tion will place him in, close companionship with ourselves, I further propose that he be honored with the title of R.

(K. 5 directs Candidate to rise and approach the East. Resumes his station and gives the following histoiy.) K. S.—After the S. S. was completed and a portion of the furniture deposited there - in, Adoniram, on a certain day near high twelve, went there to deposit one of ~the holy vessels. At high twelve, when the craft were called from labor to refresh - ment, Adoniram did not retire with the rest but lingered behind with H. A., whose custom it was at that hour to retire to the S. S. for his noon-day devotions, after which he drew designs for new work upon the trestle board. Adoniram, know - ing what his habits were, awaited him at the South Gate and asked when he might hope to receive the M. W. The conversation which ensued between the two craftsmen, and the soliloquy on death by our Grand Naster became the foundation upon which was erected this degree of Royal Master. This conversation having been felated to King Solomon by Adoniram, the M. W. was deposited in the S. V., as will be more fully explained to you in the succeeding degree, to which this is preparatory. After the untimely death of G. M. H. A., the two surviving Grand Masters insti - tuted this degree of R. M. in token of their respect for his memory, and as a partial substitute for the M. M. degree. Being un - able to for.m the Triangle in giving the M. W., as one of their number was dead, they substituted the Broken Triangle, be - ing the nearest they could come to the original. They first conferred the degree upon the noble Adoniram, and then upon other particular friends of H. A. As his friend, we now confer it upon you, and we give it as illustrative of the M. M. and R. A. degrees. The furniture of the S. S., in the com - pleted and dedicated Temple, consisted of many holy vessels made of pure gold, but • the most important article there was the Ark of the Covenant, called the Glory of Israel, which was seated in the midst of the holy place under the wings of the Cherubim. It was a small chest, or coffer, 30 31"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide and deep. It was made of wood, excepting only the mercy seat, but overlaid with gold, both inside and out. It had a ledge of gold surrounding it at the top, into which the cover, called the mercy seat, was let in. The mercy seat was of solid gold, the thickness of a hand’s breadth. At the two ends of it were two cherubs, looking inward toward each other, with their wings extended; which, embracing the whole circumference of the mercy seat, met on each side, in the middle; all of which, the Rabbis say, was made out of the same mass without any soldering of parts. • Here the Shekinah, or Divine Presence, rested, and was visible in the appearance of a cloud over it. From hence the Bathkol issued, and gave answers when God was consulted. And hence it is that God is said in the Scriptures to dwell betwecn thc Cherubim; that is, between the Cherubim on the mercy seat, because there was the Seat or Throne of the visible appearance of His Glory among’ them. This concludes the degree of R. M. You will now retire with your Conductor, while necessary preparation is made for the suc - ceeding degree.

To avert so dire a calamity from the Craft and the Jewish people, He has enjoined upon us in His Word to de - posit the sacred treasures which the people most revere in a secret and secure place, for He has promised us that in three score and ten years he will restore this people to the land which they now inhabit, and He will put it into the heart of a Prince of the House of Judah to rebuild the Temple to His Holy Name, and He will give him a sign as a reward and encour - agement for his zeal and fidelity, and the sign shall be the recovery of the Word.

(K. 5 pauses a moment with hands uplifted and says K. 5.—All is finished. HISTORY. K. 5.—In giving the history of this de - gree, we revert to the building of the Temple. Our three Grand Masters, S., K. of I., H., K. of T. and H. A., being in possession of the writings of Moses and the Prophets, well knew that if the Children of Israel deviated from the laws therein contained, their enemies would be let loose upon them, their cities and Temple sacked and de - stroyed, and all the sacred treasures of the S. S. would be forever lost. In order to prevent this evil, they agreed to erect a secret vault underground, leading from K. S’s most retired apartment and ending under the S. S. or H. of H. This S. V. was divided into nine arches or apartments. The Ninth Arch was erected by our three G. M’s. as a place wherein to deposit a true copy of all the holy vessels a~d sacred treasures con - tained in the S. S. above; also, to meet in Grand Council to confer the M. M. degree when the Temple should be com - pleted. There were employed on the other eight Arches, twenty-two mCn from Ge - bal, a city of Phoenicia, together with Ahishar and Adoniram, all of whom were well skilled in the arts and sciences gen - erally, but particularly in sculpture. Their hours of labor were from nine at night until twelve, the time when all prying eyes are closed in sleep. During the erection of this Vault, a circumstance occurred which characterizes this ddlgree and upon which the ceremony of initiation is founded. One of K. S’s. particular friends, whose name was Z., discovered that there was a secret work going on with which he had not been made acquainted, and for a long time he grieved in silence. At length he complained to K. S., and received for an answer, “Be content, friend Z., the time will come when a door shall be open for your reception,” meaning that when the 48 49"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Temple should be completed he should re - ceive the M. M. Degree. This satisfied him. One evening, having some particular business with K. S., he went to his most retired room in search of him, and, finding the door of the S. V. open, and not guarded a~s usual, b.y the Steward, Ahishar, who was sleeping at his post, he topk it for granLed that it had been left open for his reception, whereupon he en - tered and was dealt with as you have already learned. When the Ninth Arch was completed, our three Grand Masters deposited there - in an exact imitation of the Ark of the Covenant, and placed within it an imita - tion of the Pot of Manna and Aaron’s Rod, and also a true copy of the Book of the Law, or all the writings of the Bible up Lo that period. That it might be known by whom and for what purpose it was deposited, they placed on three sides of the Ark the in - itials of their names, and on the fourth, the time when, meaning, “Deposited in the Year of Light 3000, by S. K. of I., H. K. of Tyre, and H. A., for the benefit of the Craft in general, but the Jewish nation in particular.” The M. W. was then placed on the top of the A., engraved on a triangular plate of gold, on the sides of which, in certain mysterious characters, were engraved the Key or cover words, by which the M. W. may be revealed. A key to these characters was placed inside the A., in the Book of the Law, so that if The Children of Israel should ever be carried into captivity and rema[n so long as to forgeL their mother tongue, yet, on their return, by means of this key, if found, the W. might be re - stored; and that it might be known and distinguished as the M. W., when found, they placed on the top of the A. their three Jewels, one on each side of the tri - angle, knowing that a description thereof would be handed down to the latest pos - terity. Thus was preserved the long lost; N. W., now the G. 0. W., or G. and S. N., which R. A. tradition informs us was first com - municated by God to Moses at the B. B., and remained in use until near the com - pletion of K. S. Temple. It was then lost at Lhe death of our G. M. H.

Wilt Thou comfort and guide those who are saddened by the passing of our. Com - panion, and ease their sorrow through fine memories and loyal friends. Help us to imitate his virtues, and to so live that we may achieve that immortality in which\\ we believe. Inspire us to live lives which~ are manly, strong and clean, and to be~ — worthy of eternal life.” /‘"}]
