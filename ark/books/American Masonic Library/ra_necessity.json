Prior to 1717 there is no record that Freemasonry consisted of more than one degree. The sym bolism, the beautiful lecture, the ornate diction, with which we find it clothed today, represents the growth and development from the crude and transition stage of past centuries. Strictly speaking, there was no degree from the dawn of Freemasonry until it began to take on the speculative feature. Beforo the speculative era, the initiate or iJ apprentice was sworn on “the buke” to observe certain charges, now known as the “Ancient Charges and Regu - lations.” This constituted the entire ceremony, with perhaps the recital of the various legends of the Craft, portions of which are retained to this day. The Mason, prior to the “Revival” of 1717, was designated as an Ap - prentice, Fellowcraft, or Master, not because of any special ceremony or degree work, but because of tho length of timo of service and skill -3-"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"manifested in his handicraft, The Ancient Charges and Regulai,lons, as read to the apprentices, roforred to the duties they owed to each other, to the lodge and the Holy Church. It is even doubted by some of our best Masonic historians that grip and pass word were connected with these ancient ceremonies. Ancient Craft Masonry, from its earliest legendary history (625 A.D.) down to 1740, made no pretensions to philosophical speculations. No latter-day wise men existed to con - vert the simple tools of the opera - tive craftsman into a philosophical fog bank. Near the middle of the eighteenth century other than mere operatives were admitted into the guilds or lodges, and men were elected to preside over the brethren who were not skilled in the imple - ments of the Craft. The introduc - tion of the speculative Mason pre - pared the way for the dawn of Freemasonry. The so-called “Revival” of 1717 was but the bursting forth of the evolutionary forces that had been slowly developing for half a century. These same forces are at work today, so that it can truly be said that Freemasonry is a progressive science. Masonic historians are agreed that some time between 1723 and 1730 the Second and Third degrees were evolved, and in the evolution of degrees, ritualism and symbolism were developed, resulting in intellec - tual and philosophical Freemasonry of today. The central idea of the entire system of Freemasonry became the “loss” and the “recovery” of the “Word,” symbolizing death and the resurrection, the ending of the pres - ent and the beginning of the future life. The student of Freemasonry must admit that “The Word” is the central point around which the entire system of Masonic symbolism must revolve. “Its possession is the con - summation of all Masonic knowledge; when lost its recovery is the soul’s object of symbolic labor.” Mackey says: “No event in the history of Speculative Freemasonry had so im - portant an influence upon its de - velopment as a system of symbolism as the invention of the Royal Arch Degree and its introduction into the Masonic Ritual.” The Royal Arch stands as the rainbow of promise of the resur - —4- -5-"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"rection; of that which was lost and that which shall be recovered. The question arises as to whether the Master’s Word was originally communicated in the Third Degree. On this point there is some diver - sity of opinion. in our present ritual of the Third Degree the Master’s Word is lost. Dr. Oliver, a noted Masonic historian, says: “The True Word was never lost but transferred to the Royal Arch,” and in corro - boration of this statement further says: “I have before me an old French engraving of the Ground Work of the Master’s Lodge, dated in 1740, con - taining the usual emblems, and on the coffin Is the “True Word” in Roman capitals.” j if Brother Newton R. Parvin, Grand Secretary and Librarian of the Grand Lodge of Iowa, in a letter to the writer, says, “We have in the library an old ritual manuscript of 1740, which was stated to be used by the brethren of Ben Johnson, Head Lodge, No. 194. The original manuscript be - longed to George Oliver, and it in - cludes in the Third Degree the Master’s Word. This makes about sixty pages of closely written matter. It begins with a long historical intro- -6- duction. Many points are quite sim - ilar to our present methods. The language is very simple and impres - sive.” This would tend to prove that before the legend of Hiram Abif was introduced into the Master’s Degree the True Word was communicated in the Master’s Degree and not a sub - stitute Word. It necessarily followed that when the legend of Hiram be - came a part of the ritual of this degree the “loss” of the “Word” followed, as the “loss” is a part of the fliramic legend. But the “loss” without a “recovery” would be an absurdity; to complete the symbolism of Freemasonry, the “Word” must be recovered, hence the necessity for a Fourth Degree, the Royal Arch. In 1738, or earlier, the story of the loss of the Word and the new legend, the Royal Arch, were grad - ually introduced into the lodges, and when the Freemasonry of England was divided into the “Moderns” and “Ancients” (in 1751), the latter or - ganizing a Grand Lodge and adopting a ritual of four degrees, the fourth being the Royal Arch. The Grand Lodge of “Modems” —7—"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"evidently continued to use the old ritual, without the legend of Hiram Abif, while the Grand Lodge of “Ancients” used the new ritual con - taining the Hiramic legend and the Fourth Degree, until the yeai- 1813, when the two Grand Lodges united and formed the present Grand Lodge of England. It is therefore to the Grand Lodge of Ancients that we owe the Master’s degree as found in our ritual and also the preserva - tion of the Royal Arch Degree. One of the Articles of Union of the two Grand Lodges of England in 1813 was the retention of the degrees as formulated by the Grand Lodge of “Ancients”; hence, among the articles of agreement of this union we find the only declaration made anywhere or at any time as to what constitutes “Ancient Craft Masonry.” This article declares that “Ancient Craft Masonry shall consist of the degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason, together with the Holy Royal Arch.” We see, therefore, that the Royal Arch is merely the evolution of a truth contained in the early Third Degree. It is not a “Higher Degree,” but the last volume of the series in 14 ( a sublime story revealed through symbolism. The Master’s Degree with - out the Royal Arch is a story half told, a song half sung and a promise unfulfilled. The candidate is prom - ised that he should receive, but is put off with a “substitute.” He is left in darkness, in doubt, and to the thoughtful one, in a condition of disappointment. Yet, there is a purpose behind this seeming decep - tion. Light and revealed Truth come only through toil and willing service. This lesson must be learned before any Mason is qualified to know and appreciate the Truth, the Master’s Ward. It is, possibly, unfortunate that the Royal Arch Degree was separated from the “Blue Degrees”; but fortunate or unfortunate, the Royal Arch stands as the last of the degrees in Ancient Craft Masonry. It is the Summit, and no Master Mason is in possession of all that Freemasonry teaches without the Royal Arch. The series of four de - grees continued to be conferred under a lodge charter until about 1750, in America at least. The earliest his - tory that we have of the Royal Arch in this country was in 1753, when it was conferred under a lodge charter -8-- -9--"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"in Fredericksburg, Va. It was intro - ducted into New York about the same time by an English military lodge, and into Massachusetts in 1769, where it was conferred in St. Andrew’s Lodge. Since that time the Royal Arch Degree has remained secure in its superior place. The term “Royal. Arch Lodge” was succeeded by “Chapter” and “Royal Arch Chapter.” The word “Chapter” was used in Connecticut as early as September 5, 1783; in Pennsylvania, September 5, 1789; in New York, April 29, 1791; in Massachusetts, December 19, 1794. The word “Chapter” took the place of “Lodge” in England for the first time, April 29, 1768. The word “Companion,” used in the Chapter in place of “Brother,” was first used in England in 1778. These terms, Chapter and Companion, were soon carried to America, where they flourished as elements in the Capi - tular system of degrees. Such, in brief, is the history of the Royal Arch Degree; its parentage is as legitimate as any of the degrees of Ancient Craft Masonry; it sprang from the introduction of Speculative Freemasonry into Operative Masonry, —the fruit of symbolism and allegory. To be a Master Mason is the highest and most honorable degree that any man can attain; it entitles him to all the rights and privileges of the Craft; all the accumulated so-called higher degrees do not add anything to his Masonic stature. The Royal Arch is a part of the Master’s Degree—the summit of its excellency. It is the privilege and should be the duty of Master Masons to complete the Ma - sonic story, told in allegory and re - vealed in symbolism, by receiving the Royal Arch. Would you be enrolled as one living in that future generation that shall discover IT? Act now. THE MARK MASTER DEGREE The degrees of the Chapter are: Mark Master, Past Ivlaster, Most Ex - cellent Master and Royal Arch. The origin of the Mark Degree is veiled in obscurity, like all Masonic degrees, but, like the others, it sprang into existence in the earlier period of speculative Freemasonry. It was customary for the operative Masons to select for themselves a —10— —11—"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Mark, to be placed upon every piece of work wrought by them. This was done In order to keep a cheek on each operative’s work by the Over - seers, and to facilitate the payment of wages. Each Mark was distinctive and the same Mark frequently des - cended from father to son through several generations. These marks may be seen today on the stones in the old cathedrals of Europe. Facsimile copies are re - produced in all Masonic histories. In Scotland, the operative Mason was required to register his Mark by the Shaw’s Statutes issued in 1598. From this requirement of reg - istration of the Mark, the Mark Degree was evidently evolved. The earliest record of the Mark Degree being conferred in Scotiand bears the date of January 7, 1778. Yet this does not prove that the de - gree was not conferred at a much earlier date. These records also con - tain the information that the Mark Degree could not be conferred upon anyone not having received the de - gree of Fellowcraft and Master. A report made to the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of England states: There are probably no degrees in Freemasonry that ~an lay claim to a greater antiquity than those of ‘Mark Man’ or ‘Mark Mason’ and ‘Idark Master’ Mason.” The degree was conferred in Nova Scotia in 1784; in Connecticut in 1791; in New York in 1791, and In Boston in 1793. Like the Royal Arch, the Master Degree was originally ~ conferred In the lodge. In the United States, the General Grand Chapter, R.A.M., Issued Mark Lodge charters up to 1853, when it was prohibited and the degree passed under Chapter control. In England the degree is under the control of the Grand Lodge of Mark Masons; in Canada and in Scotland the control is vested as in the United States. 3 The lessons of the degree are In - tensely practical, emphasizing the great requirements in file, viz: quali - fication and service. THE DEGREE OP PAST MASTER The general use of the term “Past Master” by the Craft, means one who has been elected, installed and served for twelve months over a regular lodge. The general use of the term does not imply a separate -12- 1 —13—"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"~iegree, although in many Grand Lodges the honorary grade of “Past Master” is conferred upon a Master elect as part of the ceremony of installation. This grade or degree was, or is conferred only in the presence of Past Masters. The de - gree is the second in the series of the Chapter; hence arose the terms “Actual Past Master” and “Virtual Past Master,” the latter meaning one who had received the degree in a Chapter but who had not been elected or served as Master over a lodge. A Virtual Past Naster is not entitled to recognition by the Grand Lodge as a Past Master. The degree is an old one. We find the expression “Past Master” used in 1774 and implied one as “having passed the Chair through some cere - mony.” The Constitution of the Grand Lodge of England, 1723, speaks of the installed Master passing through certain “significant ceremonies.” There can be no doubt as to the antiquity of the degree. It dates from the birth of speculative Freemasonry. The introduction of the degree into Capitular Masonry rests on the fact that, originally, the Royal Arch was conferred only on those who had been elected and presided over a lodge as Master, but was manifestly unjust to a large portion of the brethren to have such a restriction placed upon them and the Royal Arch. The following law of 1789 illustrates this fact: “No brother can be exalted until he has been at least three years a Master Mason and has presided six months as N aster of some regular warranted lodge or has passed the Chair by Dispensation.” This law shows the old restriction and the modification that was assum - ing shape, permitting others than actual Past Masters to receive the Royal Arch. An old law found in Harmony Lodge, No. 52, Philadelphia, in 1799, states: “That every brother who has not passed the Chair shall pay fourteen dollars, out of which the Dispensation shall be paid for; if he has passed the Chair, for being exalted, eight dollars.” That is, an actual Past Master could receive the Royal Arch Degree for eight dollars, but one who has not received the Past Master’s Degree must obtain a dispensation from the Grand Master to receive it before he could be made a Royal Arch Mason, and it costs fourteen dollars. —14—-. —15——"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"When the Royal Arch Degree pass - ed from under the control of the Lodge and became a separate system, known as the Chapter, the pre - requisite to the Royal Arch remain - ed, viz: the Past Master’s Degree. The Virtual Past Master Degree be - came a part of the Chapter series. The reason for this prerequisite be - comes apparent when the lessons of this much abused, but beautiful, de - gree are studied. Obedience to author - ity is proof against anarchy, and he who would teach must first learn to obey. MOST EXCELLENT MASTER DEGREE A lie well told and repeated con - stantly becomes a truth to credulous people. This applies to the oft- repeated statement that Thomas Smith Webb fabricated the American system of Capitular Degrees, and the Orders of the Commandery of Knights Templar. But, upon investi - gation, we will find that some of the dcgrees of the Chapter and the Orders of the Commandery were in existence and conferred before Webb was born. The Most Excellent Master is frequently credited to his fertile brain, and so stated by some Masonic writers, but fortunately there is on record in Massachusetts and New York the date of Webb’s birth and the dates on which he received all the Masonic degrees. The dates go to show that the Most Excellent Master was known and conferred be fore Webb became a Royal Arch Mason. The latter half of the eighteenth century was prolific in Masonic de - grees in France and England. The degrees of all the rites can date their birth from 1723 to 1760, and in the maze of names and titles of degrees we find a veritable jungle. In this period we find the Irish sys - tem embraced The Chair, The Ex - cellent, The Super Excellent, The Royal Arch, The Knight Templar and the Prince Rose Croix. The Scottish System embraced The Mark N aster, The Past Master, The Excellent Mas- ter and The Royal Arch. St. An - drew’s chapter, Boston, worked the Irish System, except The Chair from 1769 to 1797. After 1799 the Mark, Past, Most Excellent and Royal Arch were conferred. A prominent Ma- sonic writer says of the change: “This —16— —17—"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"transition indicates and suggests that the Super Excelient Master Degree of one hundred and twenty years ago contained the marrow and something of the bone of the Most Excellent degree.” From 1791 the Most Excellent Master was a well known degree and a part of the Capitular system. The Super Excellent Master of this period must not be taken for the Super Excellent Master appendant to the Council of Royal and Select Masters of today. The Most Excellent de - gree is a fitting prelude to the Royal Arch, one of the most impressive degrees in its ceremonies and sub - limely spiritual in its symbolism. WHAT OF THE HOUR? What of the hour in Freemasonry? Brighter, stronger, clearer. We often become discouraged and are inclined to be pessimistic; but amid all the errors and stumbling, a better day is dawning, when we shall see the beneficent labors of Freemasonry shining in effulgent splendor. Free - masonry is growing in power and beneficence. As its immortal prin - ciples take root in the fallow soil of the human heart and mind, it buds and blossoms into the foliage of kind - ness and the Hesperidean fruit of charity toward aLl mankind. While the Masonic tramp may be seen on the beautiful highway of Freemason - ry, there are many more today, than ever, who are toiling in mind and heart in the treasure-strewn mines of Freemasonry’s realm. Freemasonry today means more than negative plaudits and negative principles; but she stands pre-emi - nently as a living, growing, resistless power, whose end and aim is the exaltation of man and the glory of “The I Am That I Am.” Our ancient brethren journeyed from Babylon to Jerusalem—out of bondage into free - dom-—with one strong purpose in view. What was the desire so pre - eminent in their hearts? What was the foundation of the zeal that ac - tuated them to undergo the trials and hardships of that weary journey? Let them speak: “To aid in the noble and glorious work of rebuilding our City and Temple of the Lord.” It was Work, Work, Work. Not idleness and ease. But in the building of this City —19— —18——"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of the Brotherhood of Ivlan and the Spiritual Temple of ours, what por - tion of the work are you willing to undertake? Are you willing to quarry the rough ashlar? Are you willing to be a burden bearer? Are you will - ing to work in the trenches and lay the foundation stones, away down from the sight and applause of man? Royal Arch Masonry asks us: “What portion of the work are you willing to undertake?” You may answer that, owing to my social standing, I am willing to wear the helmet and plume of the Captain of the Host, or, be - cause of my wealth and dignity, I will wear a crown and be the King, or, being a prince of good fellows, I will wear the mitre. But where are the claimants of the crow, the pick or the spade? Royal Arch Masonry would answer: Any portion of the work, be it ever so humble. It is a willing service, a self-denying service; self, but a great part of the whole; self-glorified, only as a sacrifice for all. If there is one great truth that Royal Arch Masonry teaches above all others, it is that labor is honorable, be it ever so humble. That he who would wear the crown must earn it. That he who would rule, must first learn to obey. That he who would enter the sanctum sanctorum of the genius of Royal Arch Masonry must enter by sell-denying toil, and the hinges of its doors will swing open as readily for the peasant as for the prince, for the subject as for the King. But what are the emoluments for all the hardships of the journey and toil? Is it a princely salary or the honors of official distinction? Again comes the reply: “Without the hope of fee or reward.” It implies a will - ing service without the hope of a fee or reward. It is unselfish toil. The emoluments of Royal Arch Ma - sonry are not hire, but doing one’s duty. The spirit of unselfishness is hire, the spirit of unselfishness is love. If in charity, we remove the rub - bish of disappointed hopes, may we not discover the keystone of the secret vault of the mysteries of a sweeter song, and nobler aspira - tions?
