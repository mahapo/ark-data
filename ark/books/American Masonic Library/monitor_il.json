A lodge consists of a certain man- her of Free and Accepted Masons, duly assembled, with the Holy Bible, square and compasses, and a charter or warrant empowering them to work. Our ancient brethren met on a high hill or in a low vale the better to guard against the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers ascending or de - scending. THE FORM OF A LODGE is an oblong rectangle extending from east to west between north and south, from the earth to the heavens and from the surface to the center. It is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Masonry and that I a Mason’s charity should be equally extensive. THE SUPPORTS Masonry may be said to be meta - phorically supported by three great pillars, called wisdom, strength and beauty; because it is necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important under - takings. They are represented by the three principal officers of the lodge, the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. The Worshipful Master represents the pillar of wisdom, it being supposed that he has wisdom to open and govern his lodge, set the craft to work and give them proper instruction. The Senior Warden repre - sents the pillar of strength, it being his duty to assist the Worshipful Master in opening and closing his"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"24 OFFICIAL MO ~IITOR lodge, pay the craft their wages if any be due so that none may go away dissatisfied, harmony being the strength and support of all institu - tions, especially ours. The Junior Warden represents the pillar of beauty, it being his duty to observe the sun at meridian height, the beauty and glory of the day. THE COVERING of a lodge is the clouded canopy, or starry-decked Heaven, where all good Masons hope at; last to arrive, by the aid of a ladder, called Jacob’s ladder, having three principal rounds, de - nominated faith, hope, and charity; teaching faith in God, hope ui im - mortality, and charity to all man - kind. But the greatest of these is charity; for faith may be lost in sight—hope ends in fruition—but charity extends beyond the grave, to the boundless realms of eternity. XI { ILLINOIS THE FURNITURE of a lodge is the Holy Bible, square, and compasses. The Bible we dedi - cate to the service of God, the square to the master, and the compasses to the craft. The Bible we dedicate to the serv - ice of God, because it is His ines - timable gift to man, * * * ‘~ ; the square to the master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office, and by it he is constantly reminded of the duty he owes to the lodge over which lie has been cal]ed to preside; and the compasses to the craft, who, by due attention to their use, are taught to circumscribe their desires, and keep their passions within due bounds with all mankind, but more especially with our brethren in Free - masonry. THE ORNAMENTS of a lodge are the mosaic pavement,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"26 OFFICIAL MONITOR ILLINOIS 27 the indented tessel, and the blazing star. The mosaic pavement is a repre - sentation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the indented tessel, of that beautiful tessellated border, or skirting, which surrounded it—with the blazing star in the center. The mosaic pavement is emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the indented tessel which sur - rounds it, of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us in this life, and which we hope to enjoy by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the blazing star in the center. LIGHTS A lodge has three lights, situated east, west and south. There is none in the north because of the situation of King Solomon’s Temple, which was placed so far north of the ecliptic that neither sun nor moon, at merid - ian height, could dart any rays into the northern part thereof. The north, therefore, we Iti asonically term a place of darkness. JEWELS A lodge has sin jewels; three im - movable and three movable. The immovable jewels are the square, level and plumb. The square teaches morality, the level equality, and the plumb, rectitude of life; and are worn by the three principal officers of the lodge, the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. The movable jewels are the rough ashlar, perfect ashlar and trestle board. The rough ashlar is a stone taken from the quarry in its rude and nat - ural state. The perfect ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"28 OFFICIAL MO~IITOR workmen, to be adjusted by the work - ing tools of the fellow craft. The trestle board is for the Master to draw desigus upon. By the rough ashlar we are re - minded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the perfect ash - lar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtu - ous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the trestle board we are also reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and desigus laid down by the master on his trestle board, so should wo, both operative and spocu - lative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and desigus laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of nature and revelation, which are our spiritual, moral, and Masonic trestle board. 3’ ILLINOIS SITUATION Lodges are situated due east and west because King Solomon’s Temple was so situated. King Solomon’s Temple was so situated because Moses, after safely conducting the chi]dren of Israel through the Red Sea when pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts had erected by Divine com - mand, a tabernacle, dedicated to God, which was placed due east and west to perpetuate the remembrance of that mighty east wind by which their miraculous deliverance was wrought and to receive the rays of the rising sun. This tabernacle was an exact model for King Solomon’s Temple of which every lodge is a representation. So, all lodges are, or ought to be, situated due east and west. DEDICATION Lodges in ancient times were dedi - cated to King Solomon * * * in mod-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"30 OFFICIAL MONITOR ILLINOIS em times to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist—two eminent Christian patrons of Freemasonry; and since their time there has been represented, in every regular and well furnished lodge, a certain point witlun a circle, embordered by two perpen - dicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist. On the top of the circle rests the book of Holy Scrip - tures; the point represents an i ndi - vidual brother, the circle the bound - ary line of his duty. In going round this circle we necessarily touch on the two parallel lines, as well as on the book of Holy Scriptures; and wlule a Mason keeps himse]f circumscribed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err. TENETS The tenets of a Mason’s profession are brotherly love, relief, and truth. BROTHERLY LOVE By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to regard the whole hu - man species as one family—the high and low, rich and poor; who, as cre - ated by one Almighty Parent, and in - habitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have re - mained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men; but particu - larly on Masons, who profess to be linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ILLINOIS 88 32 OFFICIAL MONITOR aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish Our connections. TRUTH Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this prin - ciple, hypocrisy and deceit are un - known among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity.

To God,f by never mentioning his name but with that awe and reverence which are due from the creature to his Creator; by imploring His aid on all your lawful undertakings, and by looking up to Him in every emer - gency, for comfort and support. To your neighbor, by acting with him upon the square; by rendering him every kind office which justice or mercy may require; by relieving his distresses, and soothing his afflic - tions; and by doing to him, as in similar cases you would that he should do unto you. And to yourself, by such a prudent and well-regulated course of discipline as may best con- I duce to the preservation of your fac - uhties in their fullest energy; thereby enabling you to exert the talents whierewith God has blessed you, as ILLINOIS well to His glory as to the welfare of your fellow-creatures.

As an individual, you are charged to practice the domestic and public virtues. Let temperance chasten, fortitude support, prudence direct you, aad justice be the guide of all your actions.

And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

And now abideth faith, hope, charity—these three; but the greatest of these is charity. THE PLUMB, SQUARE AND LEVEL The plumb is an instrument made use of by operative masons to try perpendiculars; the square, to square their work; and the level, to prove horizontals; but we, as Free and Ac - cepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes. The plumb admon~ ishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations before God and man, squaring our actions by the square of virtue, ever remembering that we are traveling upon the level of time, to “that undiscovered country, from whose bourn no traveler returns.” SECOND SECTION Mr BaovHaa: Masonry is consid - ered under two denominations, OPERATIVE AND SPECULATIVE By operative masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a struc - ture will derive figure, strength and beauty, and from which will result a due proportion and just corre - spondence in all its parts. It fur - nishes ns with dwellings, and con - venient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and xvhile it displays the effects of hu - man wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry ma - tennIs of which an edifice is com - posed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man, tor the best, most salutary, and beneficent purposes."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"44 OFFICIAL MONiTOR ILLIFOIS 45 By speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain seciecy, and practice char - ity. It is so far interwoven with religion, as to lay us under obliga - tions to pay that rational homage to the l)eity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view with rever - ence and admiration the glorious works of the creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfection of his Divine Creator. Our ancient brethren wrought in operative and speculative both. We work in speculative only. They wrought siX days before receiving their wages; they did not work on the seventh because IN SIX DAYS God created the heaven and the earth, and rested on the seventh day; the seventh, therefore, our ancient breth - ren conseciated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying fre - quent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of the creation, and to adore their great Creator. PILLARS The first object to which I will call your attention ~ * * * two brazen pillars, one on your left hand, the other on your right. The one on the left hand is called Boaz and denotes strength; the one on the right is called Jachin and denotes establish - ment. Taken together they allude to a promise of God to David that he would establish his kingdom in strength. They were cast on the plains of Jordan in the claygrounds be - tween Succotli and Zeredathah, where all the brazen vessels of King Solo - mon’s Temple were cast by one Hiram Amon or Abi, a widow’s son of the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"46 OFFICIAL MONITOR ILLINOIS 47 tribe of Naplitali. They were cast hollow * * * * They were each thirty-five cubits in height, twelve in circumference and about four in diameter. They were adorned by chapiters of five cubits each, making in all forty cubits high. These chapiters were ornamented with lily-work, net-worls and pome - granates which denote Peace, Unity and Plenty. The lily from its purity and the retired situation in which it grows denotes Peace; the net-work from the intimate connection of its parts denotes Unity, and the pome - granate from the exuberance of its seed denotes Plenty. These pillars were further adorned by pommels on their tops, represent - ing globes, denoting the universality of Masonry. Let us pass on. WINDING STAIRS a flight of winding stairs, I consisting of three, five and seven steps. THE NUMBER THREE alludes to the three degrees which every Master Masons Lodge confers. Also, to the three principal o~cers of the Lodge, the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. THE NUMBER FIVE alludes to the five orders in architec - ture. By order in architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of col - umns and pilasters; or, it is a regu - lar arrangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beau - tiful, perfect, and complete whole. OF ITS ANTIQUITY From the first formation of so - ciety, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"48 OFFICIAL MONITOR ILLINOIS 49 obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemencies of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bot tom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pil lars; and from this simple hint orig inally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The orders are classed thus: the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE The ancient and original orders of architectare, revered by Masons, are but three—the Doric, Ionic, and Cor - inthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two—the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric; and the Composite, which was more ornam en - tal, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing bat what is bor - rowed, and differ only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Cor - inthian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in archi - tecture. The Number Five further alludes to The Five Human Senses, which are hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling, and tasting. The first three, hearing, seeing and feeling, are most revered by Masons because * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"50 OFFICIAL MONITOR ILLINOIS 51 THE NUMBER SEVEN alludes to the seven liberal arts and sciences which are grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. Masonry, however, is more particu - larly founded on geometry, or the fifth science. Geometry is that science which treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered —from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, from a superficies to a solid. A point is a position without di - mensi ons. A line is a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two di - mensions, length and breadth.

By it we account for the return of sea - sons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discern - ing eye. Numberless worlds are around us—all framed by the same Divine Artist—which roll through the vast expanse and are conducted by the same unerring law o nature. A survey of nature, and the obser vation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the Divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies and birth to every useful art. The archi tect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by time and experience, have pro duced works which have been the ad miration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devasta tions of war have laid waste and de stroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity on which the utmost exer - tions of human genius had been em - ployed. Even the temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and con - structed by so many celebrated ar - tists, escaped not the unsparing rav - ages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. Tools and implements of architecture — symbols most expres - sive—have been selected by the Fra - ternity to imprint on the memory wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, are transmitted unimpaired the most ex - cellent tenets of our Institution. 0- 0- 0- * * * * 4 CHARGE — SECOND DEGREE M~ BaovHEa: Being advanced to"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"56 OFFICIAL MONITOR ILLINOIS 57 the second degree of Freemasonry, I congratulate you on your preferment. Masonry is a progressive moral science, divided into different de - grees; and as its principles and mys - tic ceremonies are regularly developed and illustrated, it is intended and hoped that tbey will make a deep and lasting impression upon the mind. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a fellow craft, you are bound to discharge. Your general good reputation affords satisfactory assurance that you will not suffer any consideration to induce you to act in any manner unworthy of the respect - able character you now bear; but, on the contrary, that yon will ever dis - play the discretion, the virtue, and the dignity which become a worthy and exemplary Mason. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to paljiate or aggravate the offenses of your breth - ren; but in the decision of every tres - pass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with jus - tice. The impressive ceremonies of this degree are calculated to inculcate upon the mind of the novitiate the importance of the study of the liberal arts and sciences, especially of the noble science of geometry, which forms the basis of Freemasonry, and which, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most use - ful knowledge; for while it proves tbe wonderful properties of nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. To the study of geometry, therefore, your attention is specially directed. Your past regular deportment and upright conduct have merited the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"55 OFFICIAL MON [FOR ILLINOIS honor we have conferred. In your present character, it is expected that at all our assemblies you will observe the solemnities of our ceremonies, that you will preserve the ancient usages and customs of the Fraternity sacred and inviolate, and thus, by your example, induce others to hold them in due veneration. Such is the nature of your engage - ments as a fellow craft, and to a due observance of them you are bound by the strongest ties of fidelity and honor.

WORKING TOOLS The working tools of a Master Mason are all the implements of Ma - sonry indiscriminately, but more es - pecially the trowel. THE TEOWEL is an instrument made use of by operative masons to spread the ce - ment which unites the building into one common mass; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of spreading the cement of brotherly love and affec - tion—that cement which unites us into one sacred band, or society of friends and brothers, among whom no contention should ever exist, but that noble contention, or rather emu - lation, of who best can work and best agree.

THE THREE STEPS usually delineated upon the master’s carpet are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, namely, youth, manhood, and age. They also allude to the three degrees in Freemasonry, Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason. In youth, as entered apprentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in manhood, as fellow crafts, we should apply that knowl - edge to the discharge of our respec - tive duties to God, our neighbor, and ourselves, so that in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy re - flection consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. EMBLEMS M~ BROTHER: I will now call your attention to nine classes of emblems or symbols of Masonry, eight of which are—the pot of incense, the bee-hive, the book of constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s sword, the sword point - ing to a naked heart, the anchor and ark, the forty-seventh problem of Euclid, the hour-glass and scythe. THE POT OF INCENSE is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent author of Our existence for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. THE BEE-HIVE is an emblem of industry, and recom - mends the practice of that virtue to"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"es OE’FICIAL MONITOR ILLINOIS eg all created beings, from the highest seraph in Heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that as we came Lnto the world rational and in - telligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them without inconvenience to our - selves. When we take a survey of nature, we view man, in his infancy more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of provid[ng sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attacks of the wild beasts of the field, or shelter - ing himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent; but, as de - pendence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made de - pendent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities for fulfill[ng the duties of reciprocal love and friend - shp. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavor - ing to add to the common stock of knowledge and understand[ng may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, and un - worthy of our protection as Masons. THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS GUARDED BY THE TYLER’S SWORD reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded m our thoughts, words and actions, particularly when before the uninitiated; ever bearing"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"70 OFFICIAL MOZ~ITOR ILLrNoIa 71 in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and circumspection. THE SWORD POINTING TO A NAKED HEART demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that ALL-SEEING EYE whom the sun, moon and stars obey, and under whose watchful care even comets perform their stupendous revo - lutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. THE ANCHOR AND ARK are emblems of a well-grounded hope and a ~vell-spent life. They are em - blematical of that Divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that anchor which shall safely moor us in a peace - ful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythag - oras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initi - ated into several orders of priesthood, and is said to have been raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowl - edge of things, more especially in geometry, or Masonry. On this sub - ject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most dis - tinguished he erected this, when, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed, Eureka! signifying, in the Grecian"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"72 OFFICIAL MONITOR ILLINOIS language, I have found it; and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. THE HOUR-GLASS is an emblem of human life. Behold, how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot, without astonish - ment, behold the little particles which are contained in this machine, how they pass away almost imper - ceptibly, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man! To - day he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost, which nips the shoot, and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to en - rich our mother earth. THE SCYTHE is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold, ‘what havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race; if, perchance, we escape the numerous evils incident to child - hood and youth, and, with health and vigor, arrive at the years of man - hood, yet ‘withal we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of time, and be gathered to the land where our fathers have gone be - fore us.
