C. — It is now high 12, at which hour it is the custom of G. M. H. A. to enter the S. S. and offer up his devotions to Deity. (Conducts candidates to the West where they stand in line facing the East.) (H. A. prays, using the 23rd Psalm, or the following prayer.) Almighty and everlasting God, in thine all pervading strength, arbiter of the fate of nations, yet from whose sight the smallest insect seeks to hide, in vain, I kneel to Thee, in supplication. Impart to me, at this hour, the strength and power I need for the completion of Thy work, and deign, 0 Almighty Father, to accept the humble homage of my soul. Let Thy inspiration fill my soul with beauty, that the work of my hands may glorify Thee on earth forever, that Thine earthly temple shall fill all hearts with a longing to behold Thy Heavenly Temple, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Father, in mercy, hear my prayer. (As the prayer is concluded, the C. C. and Candi - date proceed toward the South, the C. C. saying:) C. C. — Grand Master H. A. having concluded his devotions, let us await his return by way of the South Gate. Page 18 (H. A. goes to S. E. corner to inspect Trestle Board. As H. A, leaves Trestle Board, C. of C. with Candi - date meet and stop H. A. at South Gate.) C. C. — C. M. H. A., when shall I receive the NI. W.? H. A. — My worthy friend Adoniram, I do not know that you will ever receive it, for it is agreed by S., K of I., H., K. of Tyre, and myself, that the NI. W. can only be given when the Temple is completed and dedicated, and then only in the presence of all three. (H. A. turns to pass toward the West, when he is again interrupted.) C. C. — C NI. H. A., suppose one of you three, even you yourself, should be removed by death prior to that event, how shall I then receive it? (H. A. stops, stands meditating a few moments, then, taking the Candidate by the right arm, moves slowly around the Altar, going with the sun, saying:) H A. — Comp. Adoniram, death is a theme not lightly to be broached by those who are subject to its power. The young may die, the old must die, and the wisest knoweth not how soon. There is none that escapes the inexorable doom. The youngest E. A. upon the che&ered pavement be - low dwells ever in the shadow of death, while the invisible hand extends equally above King Solo - mon on his ivory throne. We walk upon the ashes of the generations who have gone this way before us, to which our ashes must in turn contribute. It is not for me, Comp. Adoniram, to hope for an exemption from the common doom of man.

Adoniram, death terminates the labor of man. Thenceforth the generations may build and occupy, but he will not be there. The teeming brain, the skillful hand, and the sinewy arm are alike useless and superfluous in the grave. As our Most Excellent King Solomon has said, “The dead know not anything; their love, their hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.” What an incentive is this to a faithful use of our time and our faculties, that we should build industriously while our strength endures, and labor to complete our work ere the week closes and the Sabbath of Eternity sets in. My work, Comp. Adoniram, is not complete, though I have labored long and faithfully to execute it. I may not live to see the Temple com - pleted; the NI. W. may be lost, but if I die ~ pointing down as before) it will be buried there. (Circumambulates 3rd time.) H. A. — Comp. Adoniram, it is through the gate of death that we find an entrance to the place of wages, refreshment and rest. The Supreme Master of the Universe, before whom we bow in adoration, and whose All-Seeing Eye has marked our labors in the Lodge below, promises to spread before us, in the Celestial Page 20 Lodge above, all the joys and glories of His Eternal Sabbath. After the strong hand of death has lev - eled all in the humiliation of the grave, the Al - mighty Hand of the Supreme Master shall prevail, and exalt every worthy brother to the glorious companionship of that undissolving Lodge. There the desigus upon the Trestle Board will be seen completed. There the adoration of the 12th hour will be everlasting joy. There the noontide bliss will eternally shine. There the scales of doubt and darkness shall fall from my eyes, and the wise purposes of the Divine Architect will be displayed in all their splendor. With this light of faith beaming upon me, Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? My hope, Comp. Adoniram, rests in the higher Lodge to which I am advancing. I may not live to sce the Temple completed; the NI. W. may be lost, but if I die (~~ pointing down as before) it will be buried there. (H. A. leaves the Candidate with the C.

King Solomon, the Temple is now completed; in all things I have endeavored faith - fully to serve you, and I have now come to .claim my promised reward. K. S. — Companion Adoniram, it grieves me to inform you that I cannot now comply with my promise, nor suitably reward your long and faith - ful service by communicating to you the NI XV The word can only be given in the presence of three, Since my promise was made a great calam - ity has befallen the Craft. Grand Master H. A., as you are aware, has fallen, a martyr to his trust, the victim of a foul assassination. Neither the M. W. nor a key to it was found on or about the Page 24 body, and by his death I fear the NI. W. is forever lost. You must remain content with a substitute. C C. — Ill. King Solomon, your words recall to my mind a conversation I had with G NI. H. A. just prior to his death. On a certain day near high twelve I carried up a piece of work for his inspec - tion. When the Craft was called from labor to refreshment I did not retire with the rest but lin - gered behind that I might speak to our Grand Master after he should have concluded his devo. tions and draxvn his designs upon the trestle board. When G. NI H. A. was passing out by way of the South Gate I accosted him and asked when I mi~ht expect to receive the M. W. He replied that it was uncertain that I xvould ever receive it, as the NI W. could only be communicated when the Temple should be completed and dedicated, and then On!)’ in the piesence of your Majesty, your illustrious Companion of Tyie and himself. Whereupon I said, “Suppose that one of you three, even you yourself, should be removed by death prior to that event, how shall I then receive it?” He did not immediately reply, but remained for a few moments in deep meditation, and then taking me by the arm, we walked slowly around the Temple courts three times. As we xvall<ed he dis - courscd in the most solemn manner on the subject of death, but assured me that even though he should be taken hence the M. W. would not be lost and each time as we came opposite the East Gate he struck the ground and, pointing down - xvard, said, “If I die, it will be buried there.” The Craft was soon after called to labor, and I Page 25"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"A ~;1Luingargus.nI ~x ~tichtingargus.nI A ~.ta htingargus.n) ~x ‘didvtingargus.nl ~x ~tichtingargus.n1 ~x ~ticlningargus.n1 xx ~ti~htingargus.n1 xx Nttchtlngargus.n) xx ~t~~hiingargus.nl xx KichttflgargUs.n~ xx ~iiJ~i~ngargus.nl x ii.

My worthy Comp of Tyie, how may we suit - ably reward Adoniram for the discreet silence he has observed regarding the disclosures just made as well as for his long and faithful service? H. K. T. — Ill. K. Solomon, the faithful service of Adoniram, as well as the commendable dis - cretion he has exhibited, should not go unre - warded, and as we cannot communicate to him the NI. W., I propose that he be elevated to the rank of Inspector of Works, in place of him whose death we now mourn; and, as such position will place him in close companionship with ourselves, I further propose that he be honored with the title of R.

H. A., but before you can assume your new rank, or ex - ercise the prerogatives of a R. NI., it will be necessary for you to enter into a new obligation, xvhich contains nothing that will conflict with any duty you owe to God, your country, your neigh- bor or yourself.

A., whose cus - tom it was at that hour to retire to the S. S. for his noon-day devotions, after which he drew designs for new work upon the trestle board. Adoniram, knowing what his habits were, awaited him at the South Gate and asked when he might hope to receive the NI. W. The conversation which ensued between the two craftsmen, and the soliloquy on death by our Grand Master be - came the foundation upon which was erected this (legree of Royal Master. This conversation having been related to King Solomon by Adoniram, the NI. W. was deposited in the S. V., as will be more fully explained to you in the succeeding degree, to which this is preparatory After the untimely death of G. NI. H. A., the txvo sui-viving Grand Masters instituted this degree (if R NI in token of their respect for his memory, and as a partial substitute for the NI. NI. degree. l3eing unable to foim the Triangle in giving the lxi. W., as one of their number was de,~d, they substituted the Broken Triangle, being the near - est they could come to the original. They first conferred the degree upon the noble Adoniram, and then upon othei particular friends of H A. As his friend, we now confer it upon you, and we give it as illustrative of the NI. NI. and R. A. degrees. The furniture of the S. S., in the completed and dedicated Temple, consisted of many holy vessels made of pure gold, but the most important article there was the Ark of the Covenant, called Page 30 the Glory of Israel, which was seated in the midst of the holy place under the wings of the Cheru - bim. It was a small chest, or coffer, three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide and deep. It was made of wood, excepting only the mercy seat, but overlaid with gold, both inside rn d out It had a ledge of gold surrounding it at top into which the cover, called the mercy Ii seat was let in The mercy seat was of solid gold, the thickness of a hand’s breadth. At the two ends of it were two cherubim, looking inward toward each othei, with their wings extended, which, embracing the whole circumference of the mercy seat, met on each side, in the middle; all of which, the Rabbis say, was made out of the same mass without any soldering of parts. j Here the Shekinah, or Divine Presence, rested, and was visible in the appearance of a cloud over it. From hence the Bathkol issued, and gave answers when God was consulted. And hence it is that God is said in the Scriptures to dwell between the Cherubim, that is, between the Cherubim on the mercy seat, because there was the Seat or Throne of the visible appearance of His Glory among them.

To avert so dire a calamity to the Craft and the Jewish people, He has enjoined upon us in His Word to deposit the sacred treasures which the people most revere in a secret and secure place, for lie has promised us that in three score and ten years he will restore His people to the land which they now inhabit, and He will put it into the heart of a Pi-ince of the House of Judah to rebuild the Temple to His Holy Name, and He will give him a sign as a reward and encourage - ment for his zeal and fidelity, and the sign shall be the recovery of the word. (K. S. turns to H. A., saying:) K. S. — My Worthy Companion and Master Builder, have the craftsmen completed the copy of the Ark of the Covenant? H. A. — Illustrious King Solomon, the work has been completed, and I will have the Overseers of the Work place it before you. (H. A. goes to the anteroom and heads a proces - sion bearing the Ark into the room. He superintends placing it upon the pedestal before K. S. and re - mains at the end of the “A.” Lights, except those in the East, may be out or dim when the “A” is brought into the room.

The Master Builder has prepared this copy of that sacred Ark, and, also, imitations of the Pot of Manna and Aaron’s Rod, to be placed herein as a memorial for the benefit of the Craft in gen - eral and the Jewish nation in particular. These are to be deposited here in the security of the Ninth Arch, that the memory of the sacred treasures so much revered by our people may not be lost through the vicissitudes of time. H. K. T. — (Descends and after examining the characters on the Ark, says:) Here have been placed upon the sides of the Ark the date of the present Year of Light and the initials of our names. (H. K. T. and H. A. remove cover. Take Pot and Rod from carriers. All carriers return to seats.) K. 5,— (Takes the Book of the Law and reads.) “And Moses said, this is th•e thing which the Lord commandeth; fill an omer of it to be kept br your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up be - fore the testimony to be kept.” H. K. T. — In humble commemoration of that divine command, I now deposit this imitation of that sacred Pot of Manna in this Ark, lest in time Page 42 to come the people shall forget how, for forty years, their fathers, led through the wilderness by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, were fed with that manna which fell from heaven, fresh every morning and new every night. (H. K. T. slowly and reverently places the Pot in the Ark, and then K. S. reads further from the Law.) K. S. — “And the Lord said unto Moses, bring Aaron’s Rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token.” H. A. Obedient to that divine command, I now deposit this imitation of that sacred Rod of Aaron, which budded, blossomed and yielded almonds in a single night while laid up before the testi - mony in the Tabernacle of the Congregation and as a remembrance of how the fruits in their due season were fed to the C. of I. in their long wan - derings through the wilderness (H. A. slowly and reverently places the Rod in the Ark and then K. S. reads further from the Law.) K. S. — “And it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this Law in a book until they were finished, that Moses com - manded the Levites, which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying, Take this Book of the Law and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your Cod, that it may be there for a witness against thee.” K.

On the sides of the triangle has been engraved the name of Deity in three languages of the Gentiles, the Chaldaic, the Egyptian and the Syriac. K.

S. — (Raising his hands to heauen) Oh, Thou wondrous hope of Israel, whose glory sur - passeth the power of man to conceive, before whom we bow in humbleness ol heart, behold us from amidst Thy glory in the heavens, and vouchsafe to Thy people on this occasion that protecting care and favor which is beyond the power of human tongue to proclaim, for, not until it has been announced that time shall be no more, will it be known on earth or in heaven how much we owe to Thee; then, when the books are opened, and the angels unfold the record, heaven’s arches will re-echo with the songs that celebrate Thy glory.

A., being in possession of the writings of Moses and the Prophets, well knew that if the Children of Israel deviated From the laws therein contained, their enemies would be let loose upon Page 45 xx .dlchtingargus.nI xx ‘~d~ins.~argus.n1 xx -.r~h’ I~.taruu5 ni ~aruus ni ~‘P. i-il"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ngargus.fli X% ~ litngargus.fll ~ -¾. lingargus ni ‘A ...ULlltiflgltrgUS.fll xx ‘dii~itingarguS.flI xx Nti~.htingargUS.fl[ xx NlijtingarguS.fll ugargusni m.urgus.fll Xl m2.arguS.fll - ugargus ni ‘A K’ lflcJIrgus.fll 1211 gus ni IILLtIIX.fll 211 gu~nl 2Jrgu~fli 112. uJusni uJrgus.fll ~ujruus.nI lujriZuS.fli S.x ~ti~ nuargusni xx Nil. htrigargus.fll xx Nti,.llllrIgargus.nl “A Ntichiingargus.fll xx Nllchtlngargus.nl xx -4lchlingargus.nl xx Nti~htingargus.fll \\‘ ~dichtingargUS.nl them, their cities and Temple sacked and de - stroyed, and all the sacred treasures of the S. S. would be forever lost. In order to prevent this evil, they agreed to erect a secret vault underground, leading from K. S ‘s most retired apartment and ending under the S. S. or H. of H. This S. V. was divided into nine arches or apart - ments. The Ninth Arch was erected by our three C. M.’s as a place wherein to deposit a true copy of all the holy vessels and sacred treasures con - tained in the S. S. above; also, to meet in Grand Council to confer the M. M. degree when the Temple should be completed. There were em - ployed on the other eight Arches, twenty-two men from Gebal, a city of Phoenicia, together with Ahishar and Adoniram, all of whom were well skilled in the arts and sciences generally, but particularly in sculpture. Their hours of labor were from nine at night until twelve, the time when all prying eyes are closed in sleep. During the erection of this Vault, a circum - stance occurred which characterizes this degree and upon which the ceremony of initiation is founded. One of K. S’s particular friends, whose name was Z., discovered that there was a secret work going on with which he had not been made ac - quainted, and for a long time he grieved in silence. At length he complained to K. S., and received for an answer, “Be content, friend Z., the time will come when a door shall be open for your recep - tion,” meaning that when the Temple should be Page 46 completed he should receive the M. ~VI. degree. This satisfied him. One evening, having some particular business with K. S., he went to his most retired room in search of him, and, finding the door of the S. V. open, and not guarded as usual, by the Steward, Ahishar, who was sleeping at his post, he took it for granted that it had been left open for his re - ception, whereupon he entered and was dealt with as you have already learned. When the Ninth Arch was completed, our three Grand Masters deposited therein an exact imita - tion of the Ark of the Covenant, and placed within it an imitation of the Pot of Manna and Aaron’s Rod, and also a true copy of the Book of the Law, ni all the writings of the Bible up to that period. That it might be known by whom and for what purpose it was deposited, they placed on three sides of the Ark the initials of their names, and on the fourth, the time when, meaning, “Deposited in the Year of Light 3000, by S. K. of I., H. K. of Tyre, and H. A., for the benefit of the Craft in general, but the Jewish nation in particular.” The M. W. was then placed on the top of the A, engraved on a triangular plate of gold, on the \\ides of which, in certain mysterious characters, were engraved the Key or cover words, by which the M. W. may be revealed. A key to these char - .icters was placed inside the A., in the Book of the Law, so that if the Children of Israel should ever be carried into captivity and remain so long as to foiget their mother tongue, yet, on their return, by means of this key, if found, the W. might be Page 47 xx slichungargusni xx NtlchliflgargUS.nl xx ~d1chtiflgargUs.flI xx Nt;X.iini2.arguS.fll xx ~ ~X’ j~ar~us.nl uaruuS ni •r’.."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"/— igargusnI u. lltingargus.nl -\\ -¾. tingarguS.fll xx KiJiliflgargus.flI xx NtichtifltLargUS.nl xx Nh. l-t’ingargus.fll ‘x NI. lilingargus ni 55 ~ KrnuarguS.fl~ - - i-ttzaraus.ni - l’~ tigargusni flL~ar~uS.fll n&~argus.flI nuargus ni fli.LLtrgus.fli ‘nuargusni I’ll i2iIS iii .11 12 t. iS. ni 2.
