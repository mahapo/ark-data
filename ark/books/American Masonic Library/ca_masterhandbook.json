Most of us, however, only acquire the necessary information and qualifications by hard work and study. The less experience the prospective Mastet has had in presiding over organizations and meetings, the more effort is required to meet Ihe demands ol the office. Most officers of Masonic Lodges are conscien - tious and industrious. They are not afraid of the effort required to make themselves proficient in the art of presidlng. What has been puzzling the author is how they go about acquiring the information and how do they prepare themselves for the all-important year 2 There have been numerous pamphlets and articles wntten about the practically unlimited powers and terms of the everyday operation ol a Lodge. Nor has prerogatives of a Master. Nevertheless search has not - - evealed a publication in California giving an analysis r synopsis of the duties arid functions of a Master in been published any planned course of study or instruction. Masters have had to depend mainly on learning the practical problems in connection with the operation of the Ledge by observation and experience The DIstrict Officers’ meetings have undoubtedly been assIstance in training prospective Masters. In most instances, however, the Master has had to rely upon his “native” ability to meet a situatlon when he is actually confronted with ii. To help fill this need the aulhor has prepared this handbook, cognizant of the fact that a book in and of ltself will nol produce successful and well-equipped — [II —"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Masters. This handbook is intended to give a Masts,’ Cl officer a survey of the various duties and functiong of the presiding officer of a Masonic Lodge. In oider that It may be brief, the mattet will be presented in condensed and outline form. Reference will be made to other works and publications for more detailed presentation of the subject. Ii contains extra pages for the owner of the handbook to arnplify the text with his own notes and comments. This will enable an officer to keep his ideas and suggestions in written form during the years he is going through the choirs.” When such officer reaches the East, he will have in compact form an outline of the functions of a Master, augmented with his personal comments The handbook may be used as the basis for discussion at the District meetings. In no way is it intended to be a substitute for the instruction of the Inspector to whom each Master should look for infor - mation and guidance No two men are alike. Similarly, no two Masters will direct the affairs of their Lodge in the same manner. This handbook, therefore, is merely a suggested outline of duties and functions subject to the individual desires of any particular Master or Lodge. It dces not speak with final Masonic authority. It is intended to serve as a sort of guidepost on a road where heretofore there have been few traffic signs It may serve for some to deflntl~ and summanze the functions of the office. For others, it may be a guide for future training For still others it may provide a convenient memorandum book of items con - nected with the operation of a Lodge. The duties of a Master may be divsded in any number of ways. One writer has divided them into duties to the Lodge, to the mernber and to the deceased brother and his family. They can be separated into legislative, ex - ecutive and ludicial powers. The author has preferred to classify the duties of a Master from a functional stand - point and to discuss them undei four main subdivisions. rituczl. executive, relief and entertcxinn~ent These di - visions or classifications are not entirely exclusive They do represent in general the main functional activities of a Master. To reiterate, this handbook has been wntten to sim - plify, clanfy and analyze the multitude of duties with wfiich each Master and Officer ts confronted. As each pnnting of the handbook is in a quantity to be available for several years, there is the possibility of a discrepancy between statements in the book which you are using and the regulation of Grand Lodge with reference to any amendments which have been en - acted since this edition Was compiled. If it is helpful in any respect, the author will be well repaid for his labors. il—RITUAL People have justly criticized some Masonic Lodges as “degree mills.” It is self-evident that the conferring of degrees is not the only purpose or function of a Lodge. Even Past Grand Masters have made much of the fact that too much emphasis is placed upon the ritual. Under certain arcumstances, the criticism is appro - pncrte and timely However, no matter how meritorious the criticism may be, we should never lose sight of one importanf fact. There is nothing in Masonry z~ore ins - portcrnt than the ritual when a degree is being con- — [31 — ~~~1 I I — 121 —"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ferreci. In other words, too much time can never be spent in making officers competent to conier a degree in an impressive and intelligent manner. The obligation of impressing the candidate with the lessons of the degree, and the necessity of putting on the work In a creditable manner to stimulate attendance by the brethren, requires adequate preparation, sufficient re.. hearsals and intelligent presentation. Careful attention to the ritual is, therefore, one of the pnmary duties of the Master. All Masters and Masons must adhere to the ritual recognized by Grand Lodge, Only Grand Lodge has the power to authorize any changes in the ritual, in order that it may remain as it was handed down from time immemonal The ritual consists of certain wntten or pnnted parts, commonly referred to as the “monitonal work,” and certain esoteric or secret work. The custodian or final authority of the ritualistic work is the Ritual Committee of Grand Lodge, consisting of the Grand Lecturer and the six Assistant Grand Lecturers The system of teaching the ritual is decentralized. The Grand Lecturer and the six Assistant Grand Lecturers (representing different geographical areas of the state respectively) meet numerous times during the year The Assistant Grand Lecturers have the duty of instructing the particular Inspectors in their geographical divison. There are over one hundred and sixty-six Inspectors, each of whom has approinmately four Lodges to in - struct in the recognized work Under such a system, with frequent meetings and schools of instructIon, any possible divergence in the ntual among the more than six hundred Lodges of the state is minimized. 1~ It should be superfluous to state that in teaching the ritual, keys or cipher rituals are stnctly forbidden. For an excellent discussion of the recons for this rule, see Califomia Masonic Code (hereinafter referred to in this handbook as C M C.), Section 2688 supp., and annota - ion c. The Master is solely responsible for a proper rendition of the ritual in his Lodge. Although the Inspector has the duty of examining the work, and if necessary of car - recting the same, the primary responsibility rests upon the Master What are the obligations resting upon the Master in this connection~ (A)—Mastefs Personal Ritualistic Duty I. The Master should be exemplary in the rendition of the ntual He is the standard by which the other of - ficers gauge their work lithe leader is careless, it will encourage a like attitude on the part of the junior of - ficers. In order to command respect and be able to demand perfect work by his officers, the Master must be as near perfect as his abilities permit him. 2 The Master should know all of the ritual to be rendered bit a Master. This does not mean only the third degree. Many Masters believe that when a Master reaches the East, he can proceed to forget all of the work in the first and second degrees. This common error may get support Irom another erroneous assump - tion that the first degree is the Junior Warden’s degree, and the second degree is the Senior Warden’s, In some Lodges, this has been carried to such an extent, that the Junior Warden opens Lodge in the first degree as a matter of nght without any request from the Master, It — 141 — — 151 —"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"3. The Master should render the ritual not only “letter perfect” and fluently, but with emphasis and meaning. A candidate will get less from a “letter perfect” lecture delivered in a monotone than from one with a few words transposed but delivered with feeling and ex - pression. This gives no excuse for less than perfect work, but stresses the importance of saying what has to be said in an intelligent and interesting manner. After the exact woiding has been learned, time and effort should then be spent on diction and delivery This re - quires hard work. If a Master has had no background or training in the field of public speaking, a short, simple course taken during the time he is a Junior officer can be of inestimable assistance Most men acquire good diction and effective delivery by practice and persistent effort. The proper value must be given to enunciation, pronunciation, emphasis and delivery. inition of the actual words used. (For eicample, such words as heal, tesselated, ecliptic, retractory, indite, diurnal, corporeal, hieroglyphical, etc.). Some know - ledge of the philosophby of the degrees being pre - sented will also help in the rendition. It is not necessary to read any long and involved account by some of our great Masonic authors. A short and satisfactory ex - planation of each of the degrees may be found in the publications of the Committee on Masonic Information and Responsibility and on Ritual. (See the subsequent reference to the Handbook for Candidates’ Coaches.) 5. The Master shoilld see that the proper Lodge paraphernalia is provided. Some of the jewels and furniture of the Lodge have histoncol value and sen - timent. They should be preserved in as good condition as age will permit, Other items have no sentimental value but are permitted to fall into a state of disrepair bordering on disrepute. Officers’ aprons and the mem - bers’ aprons deserve periodic cleaning. Certainly the clothing for the candidate should be fresh and clean—a small detail no doubt, but an important part of the Master’s obligation in making the candidate’s first im - pression of the Fraternity a favorable one. (B)—Master’s Supervisory Duty Over Other Officers 1. The conferring of a degree requires the joint efforts of the officers. Each officer, except the Master, is re - sporisible only for his particular part of the ntual. Upon the master is placed the duty to see that all the officers are present and properly prepared to render their parts. It is a primary obligation of each officer to be present at every meeting Il the officer finds it necessary to be absent, the Master should be shown the courtesy may be proper ior the Junior Warden to open the Lodge, but only when asked by the Master to assume the Master’s station. The Master of the Lodge has the duty to open the Lodge in all of the degrees, but he can delegate this lunction to the Wardens The practice of asking the Wardens to serve is commendable because it gives them the expenence of serving as Master. How -K ever, since the primary duty rests on the Master, he should be proficient in all the degrees 4. The Master should clearly understand the ntual being presented for the candidate. It seems unneces - sary to point out that in order to make an intelligent presentation of a lecture or any part of the work, the Master should have an understanding of what he is saying. This is fundamental. Nevertheless, it is often overlooked. Primarily, the Master should know the def - — [6l~— — [71 —"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of being requested to excuse such absence The Mas - ter’s success in having good attendance by the officers will be measured by his tact and understanding. A firm attitude on the part of the Master, yet not autocratic or unreasonble, will command respect from his officers and should result in few absences. Good leadership on the part of the Master will make itself felt in the matter of attendance of officers. 2 Brethren who are qualified should be encouraged to assist in the confernng of the degrees. The second section of the third degree lends itself to participation by the general membership. The member so asked to as - sist must, of course, be qualified to serve. It is both unfair and unwise to ask a brother to serve in the de - gree work without some warning and training. The coaches in many Lodges are well prepared to serve as officers. i. F El 3. The Master should see that the officers are pre - r~j paring for the future. When a man is serving in one station, he should be prepared, if the occasion requires, to serve at least in the station ahead of him. The lower stations in the line with little work to master give the officer the opportunity to learn some of the work of the -~ succeeding stations. The first large assignment for an t ~ officer to learn is the ntualistic work required of the Senior Deacon. It is an enormous task for a man to learn this work if he waits until the last few months of his term as Junior Deacon. The amount of work to be learned by the Junior Steward, Senior Steward, Marshal and Junior Deacon is relatively small. These years can best be utilized by preparation. for the Senior Deacon’s as -I signment. The year following, that of Junior Warden, is also a year requiring considerable work. This is an additional reason for using the first few years in plan - ning ahead The Junior Steward should be able to do the Senior Steward’s and Marshal’s work. Preparation for two years ahead, while officers occupy these lower stations, will make tfte work immeasurably easier when tfte more difficult assignments are reached. The Master should see that some such schedule is adopted by the officers and put into actual operation. 4. The supervisory obligation of the Master is to see not only that the officers know the ritual “letter perfect,” but also that their diction and delivery is such that the degree is presented in an intelligent and creditable manner. The officers should be impressed with the importance of pronunciation and emphasis. 5. The Master should of course give careful consider - ation to the initial appointment of a brother in the line and the advancement of such officer each year through the appointive chairs. Since a man should display ex - ecutive as well as ntual ability this matter of ap - pointment will be fully discussed under the executive functions of the Master. (C)—Schools of Instruction and Rehearsals I. The most important factor in our system of learning and presenting the ntual in an impressive manner is the School of Instruction. These schools are conducted by each Inspector for the Lodges in his district. De - pending upon the individual Inspector, and the cir - cumstances, these schools may be for the entire district or for an individual Lodge. Attendance is, of course, obligatory upon the officers. Special registers of at - tendance, kept by the Inspectors are forwarded to the — [9] — — [81 —"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the Officer’s Coach. (D)—Conlerring of Degrees 1 Primarily, it should be borne in mind that there is nothing in the entire field of Masonry which is more important than the ritual when a degree is being con - ferred. Everything else must be subordinated to a prop - er and intelligent rendition of the degree. A perfect degree should be the standard at all times Anything less than perfection should be frowned upon It is human to err, and mistakes are bound to occur, but the ideal—a perfect rendition—should always be the goal sought. A problem anses in some Lodges with refer - ence to the prompting of the officers. Momentary for - getfulness is liable to occur at any moment. Confusion results when the prompting is done haphazardly by anyone in attendance. In some Lodges, even the breth - ren attending take it upon themselves to prompt the officers. The confusion will be eliminated if the Master will designate some one officer or Past Master to do all the prompting which may be necessary 2. Of course the degree should be conferred with dignity Undignified degree work is an indictment of the ability of a Master. Lack of dignity on the part of any officer should receive immediate and strong censure from the Master. 3. There are some preliminaries to the confernng ol the first degree which should be attended to by the Master A candidate’s opinion of the Fraternity may be governed by events occurring pnor to the actual con - fernng of the degree This is particularly true about that period between election and receiving the first degree. U U — [111 —"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"advising the candidate regarding the use of the lamb - skin apron he receives during the first degree. It seems a shame that many Lodges give the apron to the can - didate and advise him to put it away until it may be used during the last rites for the brother. Every member cannot be expected to bring his own apron every time he attends Lodge. However, it would not be asking too much from a candidate to require him to wear the lambskin apron he receives during the first degree until he has received the third degree. Such a custom will make the apron seem ol more importance. Inscription of dates of initiation, passing and raising make the apron a Masonic record as wellasa part ala Mason’s clothing. 7. At the conclusion of the third degree, the candi - date receives, or should receive, a number of items. Many Lodges present the candidate with a trowel prop - erly mscnbed, as a memento of the occasion This is a nice gesture on the part of the Lodge. Since 1917, it has been obligatory on each Lodge to present to the candi - date, upon the completion of his degrees, a volume of the Constitution properly inscribed by the Master and Secretary as a “souvenir of brotherly regard from the members of the Lodge, and a talisman of fidelity to his trusts in all the years that may come to him.” For many years, the candidate received the book containing the Constitution and decisions, a volume too complicated for any newly raised Master Mason to comprehend or digest. Accordingly, there was prepared for distri - bution to the candidate a neat little booklet entitled Constitution and By-Laws. It contains the certificate of contobutions to Masonic Homes, presentation state - ment, Constitution of Grand Lodge, By-Laws of the Lodge (Uniform) and the Landmarks and Ancient Laws.

Many of the customs and the procedure in the Lodge are unfamiliar to him.The candidate should not be required to learn this most necessary information by the trial and error method There is an easier way to acquaint the new brother with facts which will smooth the way for his contads with the Lodge and Masonry in general. There is a manual of information for the individual Mason entitled “Masonic Law and Custom.” It was originally prepared by Brother Max A. Plumb, Secretary of Char - ter Rock Lodge No. 410, was extensively revised in 1948 by the Committee on Masonic Information and more recently brought up to date. Its purpose is to promote “a closer cooperation, and a greater sense of solidarity between the Lodge and its members; that the young Mason may find it of aid in molding his Masonic char - acter and Ihus improve the quality ol the future Lodge” Some of the subjects covered bnefly are entenng and retinng from the Lodge, decorum in the Lodge and an - teroom, proper Masonic titles, how to vouch and be vouched br, visiting another Lodge, application for degrees, balloting on applications and objectives, work on committees, remaining in good standing, Masonic offenses and secrecy. The price of the pamphlet is nom - inal, and the Lodge and Master will be repaid many times bar presenting these booklets to the candidate for his use and edification. They may be purchased through the Grand Secretary’s office. II~ I, ,-ET1 w516 327 m549 327 lSBT I~. k~Zu Liz. 9. The close of the third degree is a good time to call the candidate’s attention, and incidentally the attention of all the brethren, to the importance of giving the signs in the accepted manner Some of the signs one sees in the Lodge icom are not recognizable as belonging to any fraternal order, least of all to Masonry. Pride of appearance should induce a brother to salute the Mas - ter in a form which at least resembles the signs as taught. There is no better time than the start of a man’s Masonic career to impress this lesson of giving proper signs. The general membership will also benefit from this periodic explanation. 10. The Master should be versed in the regulations controlling the degrees, restricting the work to week days and not Sunday, and that the degree conferred must be completed at one meeting; furthei, that the Lodge should not confer degrees upon more than five applicants at any one meeting, nor more than five degrees in any one day, nor more than one degree upon any one applicant at any one meeting, nor shall it confer either of the degrees upon more than one ap - plicant at a time. 11. Occasion sometimes requires a candidate to re - ceive his degrees in a Lodge other than the one in which he was elected to receive them A common error is for the Master of an electing Lodge to make arrange - ments for some other Lodge to do the work without tfle knowledge of his Lodge. It is necessary that the Lodge autbonze the Master to request the conferring of such degree by the other Lodge. This is provided for by Sections 2672, 2674 and 2676 C.M C The first degree cannot be conferred in another Lodge in ths jurisdiction nor can any of the degrees be conferred by a Lodge in The By. Laws contain many blanks which must be filled in to conform to the By-Laws of the particular Lodge. The Mastei should see that the booklet is both properly completed and mscnbed before presentation. — [14 1 — — 115 1 —"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"another junsdiction, except under written permission from the Grand Master. In the reverse situation, the Lodge may be requested to confer a degree at the re - quest of another Lodge in California or foreign juris - diction. Degrees by courtesy for Lodges of a foreign jurisdiction may give a Master some concern. This may anse particularly where the brother has become and is a resident in California. It seemed unjust to ask a Lodge in California to confer degrees on men who thus be- come members of a Lodge in a state in which they no longer resided. Accordingly, Grand Lodge has fol - lowed the rule that it is no breach of courtesy to refuse to confer a degree upon a Mason who resides here, and under the current policy of Grand Lodge, such requests will not be approved. Rather, it should be expected that such Mason would secure a dimit or waiver of junsdic - tion and in due time petition a Lodge near his new home. The Master should exercise his discretion in these cases. However, when degrees are conferred, the Master should see that all requirements of the foreign jurisdiction are complied with, such as a signature for the By.Laws, etc. Before completing arrangements for the appearance of any degree team, the Inspector of your Lodge should be consulted as to the proper procedure 1 The Ordinances provide that before a Lodge shall advance an Entered Apprentice or Fellowcraft to a higher degree, he must have given satisfactory evi - [ w~u I~. U -ET1 w516 327 m550 327 lSBT i~:u i~u 12U dence by strict examination in open Lodge that he is entirely probicient and well qualified in that or those degrees he has already taken The duty incumbent upon the Master pursuant to these requirements calls for careful planning and supervision. The candidate comes into intimate contact with the membership of the Lodge in a fraternal manner through his coaching work. His respect for the Institution therefore should be enhanced by the manner in which he is taught the candidates’ lectures. 2. The appointment of an efficient Coaching Commit - tee under the leadership of an inspiring chairman is the first step. The Master’s duty, however, dces not auto - matically end with the appointment. He should discuss wJ’ the Committee and consult with them on such matters as the advisability of having different members specialize on certain degrees, fixing definite times when the members will be available for instruction, and arranging for distribution of the monitorial part of the lectures to the candidate. These are all details which the Master should decide after consultation with the Committee. Each Lodge will handle these details in a different manner depending on circumstances and past custom. They are matters which should be defin - itely determined at the start of the year. The Master has the further supervisory function to see that the members of the committee are punctual in their appointments and available for instruction. 3. Care should be taken to see that the work as taught by the members of the Committee is uniform. The Master should arrange for the Chairman to hold meetings of the Committee to eliminate any possible divergence from the recognized work. An annual meet- — [17 ] — U 12.

It would also be beneficial if the mernbers of the Committee would become acquainted with the philos - ophy and explanation of the vanous degrees. Candi - dates make innumerable inquines from the merribers while receiving instruction and a knowledge of the degrees will enable the instructor to give enlightening answers. The Committee should be asked to read the Handbook for Candidate’s Coaches prepared by the Committee on Ritual in 1962, and at least one of the coaches should be qualitied by the Inspector to instruct Candidates in accordance with the plan for Candi - date’s coaching, under the supervision of the Inspector and Master as outlined in the Grand Lecturer’s report to Grand Lodge. (See 1962 Proceedings, pp. 100-101.) 5 The Master should be certain ihat the Coaching Committee is prepared to give instruction in the third degree work. The presentation of Grand Lodge certifi - cates to brethren who have qualified in this work should boa special event in the Lodge calendar. It will encourage members of many years standing to make themselves proficient in the work and qualify for these certificates Some Lodges are successful in having groups of brethren study and take their examination as a special Lodge feature. 6 Examinations shall, of course, be conducted in open Lodge with the questions and answers given in a distinct tone ol voice. The law permits multiple exam - inations at one time, allowing the questions to be put to and answered by the candidates in rolation, limiting the number to five It is questionable whether this prac - tice should be commended, rather than have each candidate give the entire examination. a a I~u E~u L~zu ru 7. As a final suggestion the Master should never permit any candidate to present himself for examina - tion unless the Master has been advised by the Chair - man of the Committee that the candidate will be able to give a creditable examination. Any person is sublect to momentary forgetfulness but no candidate should be embarrassed by lack of preparation and an unsatisfac - tory examination. (F)—Grand Honors and Reception of Grand Officers 1. The matter of Grand Honors seems to be subject to some doubt. Nowhere in the Constitution or Regula - tions is there any explanation of these honors. What are the pnvate Grand Honors? In the 9th edition (1922) of the Constitution Blue Book appears the statement, “The pnvate Grand Honors are the signs of the several de - grees given in a manner and upon occasions known only to Master Masons” When are the pnvate Grand Honors used’? If the Master will examine the section on Reception of Grand Lodge Officers in the latest Monitor and Officer’s Manual (Revised 1985) the note on page 60 gives the answer “The private Grand Honors are to be given only to the Grand Master, the Inspector of the District on official visits, or to a Grand Lodge Officer making a visitation to a Lodge by direction of, and as representative of, the Grand Master.” The Ordinances particularly provide that the Inspector on his official visits is to be received with Grand Honors. See Section 1122 C.M.C. The matter is only important to this extent. The Grand Honors are in many instances bestowed on Masons more or less distinguished but who are not, as a matter of strict Masonic right, entitled thereto. No harm is really done thereby except to cheapen that which should be reserved f or those who, by reason of — [19 1 — I mg with the Inspector would be helpful in this regard. I ‘p — [18 1 —"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"3 The most important matter for the Master in con - nection with the reception of distinguished Masons is to see that his corps of officers know and have mernonzed fully and completely the form of reception set out in the Manual above referred to, starting on page 57 A re - hearsal of the ceremony is an almost absolute neces - sity The usual nervousness on receiving a Grand Lodge officer will be greatly diminished if there has been some practice by the officers in the ceremony of the reception. The Master should be certain that the officer being received is ieferred to by his correct title. A list of the correct titles of Grand Lodge officers is found on page 60 of the Manual 4 A detail, not connected with the ntual for the re~ ception of the Grand Lodge officers, but beanng some relation thereto, might be mentioned here Care should be taken to meet the Grand Master or other Grand Lodge officer when he arnves in town for a meeting Likewise, providing transportation from the hotel to the meeting place is a courtesy which should not be over - looked. Grand Masters are desirous of knowing the Masters and officers of the constituent Lodges and a visit by the Grand Master should be the means of es - tablishing this fnendship. (G)—Funerals - One of the most controversial subjects in Masonic endeavor is that of Masonic funerals There are some who believe that the woeful lack of attendance by the brethren and the uninspiring rendition of the funeral service by Masters gives good cause for the complete elimination of any service of this kind. Others contend that there should be a Past Master or brother who should be paid for his services in conducting the funer - al. Still others urge that, even though the service re - ceived rather recent revision, it is still subject to further revision and condensation. We are not here concerned with the pro and con of the arguments involved, but merely to consider the function of the Master when faced with the necessity of conducting such a service. 2. The first question is, when is it necessary for the Lodge or Master to conduct the funeral service? By law every Master Mason who dies in good standing is en - titled to bunal with Masonic honors, regardless of the disposition which is to be made of the remains This is the nght and privilege of the deceased and his family, but if no request is made for a Masonic service, the Lodge cannot and should not insist upon performing the last rites. The penod when a loved one passes away is a trying one tar the family Many widows and families have a wrong conception of what the Masonic Lodge does or should do when a brother dies. Many — 1 21] — their rank, should be accorded special homage. 2. The public Grand Honors are provided for in the Ritual for Presentation of the Golden Veterans Award to Veteran Masons. At the close of the ceremony the Brother making the presentation states that the brethren “will join with me in saluting our Brother by the battery of three times three.” The nine claps or concussions is a simplihed demonstration of a more complicated sign in which three blows on the breast, on the palms of the hand, and on the thighs are repeated three times, mak - ing nine in all. Public Grand Honors do not partake at the esotenc character that the pnvate Grand Honors should have. r. — [20] — - a. ~."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"3 A Masonic service having been requested, the Master’s next duty is to see that the officers and brethren are notified of the time and place. Officers usually pres - ent no problem. The attendance of brethren does offer some difficulty Almost every Master is faced with the problem of having a representative group of members at the funeral Of course, attendance is a duty of every Mason, which the Master can even put into effect by summons. See Section 2908a, C M.C. However, no Master wishes to enforce the duty by such drastic means The only alternative is a process of education to impress the Lodge with the necessity of attending, both from the fraternal and the public paint of view The S Masonic fraternity is judged in many cases by its public ceremonies as at cornerstone lcryings and funerals, and the general public is attentive to the interest shown in the attendance of Masons The matter al attendance is one of the Master’s first concerns in connection with funerals I -[221- instructions as to the procedure to be followed when the funeral service is held either in the Lodge room or in a chapel or home. The Master should acquaint himself with the explanations and instructions which clearly and completely describe the entire service. If the Master has not memorized the service, which is highly com - mendable, at least he should read it aloud several times to became acquainted and accustomed with the language and thought Nothing will discredit the fra - ternity mare than a Master who mispranaunces the wards (such as reciprocal, fiat, immutable) or stumbles through the ceremony as if he had never heard of it before If the Master dces not feel competent to conduct such a service, it is his duty to provide some Past Master or brother to take charge. Only those brethren who have been properly certified by the Inspector of their district are permitted to conduct the Masonic Funeral Service Your Inspector should be consulted far instruc - tions as to the procedure currently appropriate. 5. The entire Funeral Service should be memorized by the Master, if at all possible It is permissible to refer to the book, however this should be kept too minimum The Lodge roam or funeral parlor can be arranged so that the book is not conspicuous, by having it rest upon a stand or pulpit. However, when the Master, has to approach the casket, it should not be done with a book in one hand and the apron and acacia in the other. 6. Although there is no regulation dress far the Mas - ter, propriety requires that he be clothed an some dark suit. There is something incongruous about a Master conducting a funeral in a light suit or sporty clothing. 7. Nate should be made that the service as printed people think the fraternity is a sort of burial society, Others feel that the Lodge will think ill of the family if a Masonic service is not requested With unmeasured tact, the Master in contacting the family should not shirk the duty of conducting the services if definitely desired by the family, yet at the same time, the Master should explain that a Masonic service is not a necessity This visit of the Master to find out what is required is one in which the Master is called upon to exhibit great sym - pathy, understanding and tact. 4 Then comes the all-important item of the rendition of the ritual.

It has been definitely ruled that out of respect to the wishes of the deceased, and as a courtesy to another fraternal organization, the Master might properly re - quest some other aiganizatian to render its service, or a part of it Although it is permissible, the wisdom of such joint services is questionable. One of the main reasons far revising the funeral ntual, besides removing some of the terrors of death contained in it, was to shorten the ceremony. Asking some other organization to partici - pate and thus add to the length of the funeral service, defects that purpose. Far the same reason, there should be no need far a Masonic service where there is a min - ister, unless the family absolutely demands it. 9 As a final ward, there might be added “the funeral service should always be rendered well. Dane by com - petent officers, the effect is sublime and secures public approbation. Dane by ignorant, unintelligent leaders, the effect is worse than ndiculous, and deters sensitive mei i from the portals of the Lodge” In his 1968 report the Grand Lecturer pointed out the mounting wave of criticism that had developed in re - cent years because of the manner in which our Masonic N I I I N 11 U a a a a I~Ru I~ZU I~:U Funeral Service was being rendered in various paris of our junsdiction. Subsequenily, in January 1969 a di - rective was addressed to the Inspectors reiterating the policy submitted to Grand Lodge by Grand Lecturer, Chester H. Warlaw, requiring Masters-elect, as part of their qualifying examinations, to be proficient in the Masonic Funeral Service. This policy, incidentally, was again referred to in the 1950 Proceedings of the Annual Communication. The directive also stipulated that the Inspector would ascertain that at least two or mare qualified brothers were not only qualified but available to perform the Puneral Service in a proficient maimer and that he would ascertain the proficiency of the Master, or any other brother designated by the Master, who regularly or occasionally performs the ceremony in each Lodge in the District. The Inspector was also charged with the responsibil - ity of keeping a continuing record of those brothers who are qualified and capable of perlarming the Service in each Lodge. During the year several complaints were received that Masters, Officers, and the Brethren were not ful - filling their Masonic duties in regard to funerals. First, Masters were not contacting and visiting the widow or family of the departed Brother and, secondly, that the Lodge members were negligent in their duty to attend the final rites far the Brother. These points require care - ful consideration an the part of Masters and Officers who have been negligent in the past. — 1 25 t — contains the portion given at the funeral parlor or Lodge loam and also the part given at the place of “committal.” As covered by the 1956 legislation, the so- called “committal” can be used also in cremation or mausoleum services.

Rehearsal of this portion of the work, even though the ceremony is not regularly performed, is advisable. 1. Probably the mast important meeting of the year in every Lodge is the annual installation of officers. In many Lodges, the particular method and manner of conducting the ceremony has became so well estab - lished by custom and expenence that any suggested change would bring about a veritable revolution. The installation of the officers by some particular Past Mas - ter or Grand Lodge officer in many instances becomes L:~. —(261 — an unchangeable rule. Nevertheless, the Master should not lose sight of the fact that it is not only his preroga - bye, but also his duty, to install his successor. Much may be said for the custom of having each Master in- stall his successor It is a fitting cliniaic and conclusion for the term he has served. The Master-elect, of course, has no right to name the installing officers Even though a Past Master or Grand Lodge officer is requested to install the officers, the Master has the duty of seeing that all arrangements for the meeting are made 2. Recent copies of the installation service should be available, bath far the Installing Officer and the Master of Ceremonies. The mast recent edition, as revised in 1971, is printed in very large, readable type. The instal - lation service~-1s supplemented by key-numbers ref er - nng to paragraphs in the addendum attached to the installation service which fully describe the procedure of installation. A review of these instructions by all participantsshould result in a smooth and uniform in - stallatian service. The Master should see that the Lodge is properly supplied with the mast recent ritual for installation. 3. The Master, if he is to act as installing officer, should become acquainted with the ceremony. It can - not be read on the night of the installation for the first time and be expected that the brethren assembled will understand what is being presented. Same Lodges have adopted the commendable custom of having the Master commit to memory the installation service in its entirety or some part thereof. Credit is due to Masters who undertake this extra memory work. However, for thcse who read the ceremony, they should at least re - view it several times and endeavor to understand the — 27 I — It was in 1918 that the then Grand Lecturer, Bra.

The matter received further attention at the Annual Com - munication in 1927, and it was provided that “at the annual election of officers, and at such other meetings as may be deemed desirable by the Master, the flag shall be formally presented at the altar by the Marshal and received in the manner prescnbed by the Grand Lecturer.” The Master, therefore, should have in mind this inspriing demonstration of patnatism to be used at various meetings during the year. -I - (I)—Instullcztjon Cereniony a.— -~ - a —"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"meaning of the service.

It is advisable to have a rehearsal far this mast important gathering. It will insure a smoother meeting. 5. Installation meetings all lend themselves to one criticism. They last too long. Many Past Masters cannot resist the temptation to make a long speech before the largest turn-out of the brethren far the year. Installation meetings, like other Lodge gathenngs, should be con - cluded at a reasonable hour. The admonition, there - fore, should be given to the Master-elect to see that brethren called an to make remarks are warned pre - viously to be brief The Master can and should control the number of presentations and other speeches. 6. The matter of the music should be given same can~ sideratian Many brethren expect the music at installa - tion to be something extra over that which is usually provided at a regular meeting However, there is no need to make the installation meeting a musical con - cert. Many Lodges have adapted the custom of having a musical number of same sari after the installation of each officer in every station. With one hour far the installation ceremony, one hour far music and one hour far opening, closing, presentation of Past Master’s jewel, apron, gift, etc., there is a three haui meeting; a meeting starting at eight o’clock closes at eleven o’clock, this may be followed by a supper which may last to the midnight hour lithe toastmaster calls an a few Past Masters for their favorite jokes.

What is required, however, isa careful consideration of the problem presented and a prompt solution. The first step toward salving a problem is a complete analysis of the situation Merely understanding the problem will, in many cases, point out the solution. Then the Master should know where to search and endeavor to find an answer. If necessary he should, of course, seek advice. Finally, after due deliberation, and evaluation of the advice received, the Master should, as promptly as possible, reach a decision and act accordingly Ana - lyze your problem, try to find the answer, seek advice if necessary, decide and act promptly. Fair and proper decisions will undoubtedly result tram such action by the Master 1. The first task facing every Master is the selection of the brethren to fill the appaintive positions in the line of officers. At least one and usually mare are appointed as officers of Masonic Lodges I or the first time. Needless to say, careful consideration should be given to such appointments. Each appointee under our system of advancement is a prospective Master of the Lodge. The Master’s obligation to make a judicious and wise selec - tion is one of his most important duties 2. The many circumstances to be taken into consider - ation on the appointment of an officer far the first time are so varied that it would be impassible to set out any fixed formula far a Master to fallow A particular situa - tion in a Lodge may necessitate an appointment con - trary to what may be taken as the general rule How - ever, certain broad qualifications may be set forth as a general guide a. The appointee must have the potentialities of a future Master. Because a brother has been a goad chairman of either the coaching or entertainment com - mittee, is no assurance that he will be a goad Master. The brother must have not only the ability to master the ritual but also be able to act as the chief executive of - ficer of the Lodge should he reach the East. b. The appointee must be engaged in an occupation which permits him to spend the time required far Lodge activities. Na man should neglect his business or pro - fession to perform Lodge duties. If the time cannot be spared, then the appointment should not be accepted c. The appointee should have some desire and am - bition to serve as an officer The mistake is sometimes made of carrying to an extreme the theory that the office should seek the man. Urging and persuading a man to be an officer, when there is same doubt in his mind whether he desires to take such office, will undoubtedly result in future difficulties. — 1 31 i — 4 Complete instructions far the participation by the Lodge in Grand Lodge ceremonies are contained in the Lodge Manual fl—EXECUTiVE E~=. i~:. c~:u (A)—Appoizitment of Officers — f 30 1 —"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"d. The appointee should be selected only after con - sultation with the Past Masters and the aflicers. Same Masters fail to distinguish between consulting with a group and being dictated to by such group. What is here suggested is that the Master should seek advice an his prospective appointments, weigh the suggestions of the persons with wham he has consulted, and then make his own decision an the appointment e The appointee should be given to understand that the appointment is far one year. In the ordinary course of events, if the man shows that he possesses the ne - cessary qualifications, he will be reappointed by suc - ceeding Masters However, if it is made clear that the appointment is temporary, it may be an incentive far the man to make himself proficient. It will also enable future Masters to eliminate mare easily men who dem - onstrate that they are not proper material far the Master’s position The appointee should have those rather indefin - able qualities of goad fellowship and leadership He must be able to fraternize with his fellow officers He should be able to inspire the general membership, command respect and be able to lead. 3 What factors should a Master take into cahsider - atian in reappainting officers and advancing them to higher stations’? a Na officer should be reappointed who is incompe~ tent, disinterested or unwilling to cooperate Dropping men from the line is a serious thing, and sometimes leads to a crisis in the Lodge Nevertheless, when it is clear that an officer does not possess the ability to serve — [ 32 1 — I~.

Na officer should be reappointed without the un - derstanding that the reappointment is temporary The same reasons apply here as rn the matter of the ap - paintment of an officer far the first time. c Na officer should be reappointed without a per - sonal interview with the Master Such an interview gives the Master the opportunity to paint out to such officer the duties required of him The Master should point out the necessity of learning the work of the next station as soon as possible The officer should be as - signed to the work of some particular activity By divid - ing the activities among all the offices and stations, each officer takes an active part in such work Rotating each year to a new activity, such officer will have had direct expenence in all work by the time he becomes Master 4 Frequently the Master is required to appoint an officer to the station of Secretary, Tiler or Organist. These are the only positions in the line for which com - pensation is allowed The right of the Master to make such appointment arises an the death, resignation or removal of the officer Extreme care should, of course, be exercised in the selection. There is one consideration that the Master should bear in mind. Do not appoint a brother as Secretary or Tiler to provide him with an — [ 33 1 — — .. a - —"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"income and thus save the Lodge from giving him relief. The appointee’s qualifications far the position ought to be the sale determining factor and not his need. H the brother requires assistance, help him in the ordinary way 5. As a final ward an the appointment of officers the Master should endeavor to develop an “esprit de corps” among the officers. There should be created a strong bond of fellowship. There should be group pride in doing the degrees in an intelligent manner and an eager readiness to help any officer who needs assis - tance. The Master can paint out to the officers this goal mare impressively upon appointment than at any other time. 1 The Ordinances provide that every Lodge must hold a monthly stated meeting far the transaction of its regular business The order of business is fixed by Ar - ticle Xli of the By-Laws and is as follows (it Reading of the Minutes (2) Reports of Investigating Committees (Other committee report came under Miscellaneous and Unfinished Business) (3) Balloting (4 t Reception of Applications (5) Miscellaneous and Unfinished Business (6) Canfernng of Degrees Further assistance and explanation is given in the Mon - itor and Officer’s Manual (Page 44 of the mast recent edition, which should be in the hands of all officers). The exact language to be used by the Master far the first ff~:~ I~. 7 - E~. i~m i;zu I~u I~u three items of business namely the Reading of the Min - utes, Report of Investigating Committee and Balloting, is fully set forth. There is, of course, no established farm of language far handling the item of Miscellaneous and Unfinished Business As the Manual shows, this con - sists of Reports of Special Committees. Bills and Com - munications and New Business. 2. The first duty of the Master is to memorize the Mani - tonal work for conducting the stated meeting. It should be obligatory an every Master to give this work as a part of his qualification far a certificate for installation. Nothing looks worse than to see a Master conducting a stated meeting with a Monitor open an the pedestal before him. Too much stress cannot be laid upon the necessity for a Master to know this part of the work as completely as he knows the third degree lecture It isas important, if not mare so, because the stated meeting occurs monthly and third degrees may not be schedul - ed that often. There is always the tendency to delay learning Manitanial work, but the recognized method of conducting the stated meeting should be completely mastered prior to installation. 3. The second duty of the Master is to review the matters to come before the meeting. Some business or proposition may arise spontaneously from the floor. The majority of business, however, originates with the Mas - ter and officers or is business of which the Master has had some previous knowledge. The Master should see that any special committees are ready to render their reports. He should examine all communications and eliminate those not necessary to be read and be ready to summarize any lengthy letters. Care should be taken (fl)—Stczted Meetuigs —1 34 1 — — [ 35 1 —"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"that all official communications from the Grand Master or Grand Secretary are read in open Lodge. The presid - ing officer can make the most ordinary program of busi - ness interesting if the Master will give same considera - tion to the matter prior to the evening of the meeting 4 The mast important duty of the Master, however, is to learn the art of being a gracious presiding oflicer. Under Masonic law, the Master has mare power than the presiding officer of any other organization The use of such power, however, in an autocratic manner would not make a meeting attractive The Master must give all brethren the opportunity to speak on matters before the Lodge He must be impartial and fair and, at the same time, maintain his position as the final author - ity This almost despotic power of the Master may be entirely justified by the nature of our Masonic Institu - tion A fine explanation for this power has been given by the late John Whicher, in the article entitled “Pre - rogatives of Masters and Wardens” which is out of print but is available in the Masonic Library He states, “The Master is responsible to Grand Lodge for the good con - duct of his Lodge To him, alone, the supreme Masonic authority looks for the preservation of order and the observance of the modern law, the ancient Constitu - tions, and the Landmarks of Masonry It is manifest, then, that it would be highly unjust to levy so heavy a responsibility if it were in the power of the Lodge to overthrow his decisions or to control or question his authority, and it is but right that he should be invested with an almost unlimited power corresponding with his unlimited responsibilities “ In spite of this extensive power and responsibility, the Master should always be a gracious presiding officer 2 mm U ~zu 7 - I~. I~zu I~. i~:m 5. There is one way in which the Master may make the stated meeting an attractive as well as a beneficial one. Many brethren feel that most of the discussions at meetings is corned on only by Past Masters. The aver - age member is reluctant to express his opinion. The Master should encourage all brethren to take part in the discussion Encouragement by the Master will do much to bring about a greater interest by the member on the side lines and also to eliminate the old complaint “the Past Masters run everything “The attention of the Mas - ter to this detail will result in great benefit to the Lodge. 6. When the portion of the stated meeting dealing with miscellaneous and unfinished business is reach - ed, the Master may find that he should have some knowledge of parliamentary law. What is parliamen - tary law and how much should a Master know? Parlia - mentary law is the accepted code of rule’s for governing the conduct of a deliberative body or assembly It gov - erns in a Masonic Lodge in so far as it is not repugnant to the peculiar character of the Institution. It is neces - sary, therefore, that the Master have some know ledge of parliamentary law, An extensive study is not neces - sary The Master should know some of the fundamen - tals of procedure as modified by Masonic Law. If the Master has had no expertence in acting as a presiding officer, he should make an effort to acquire this knowl - edge prior to the year he serves as Master. Every Mas - ter should read the article prepared by the late Bra. John Whicher, entitled “Masonic Parliamentary Law.” It sets forth in abridged form the fundamentals a Master should know Because it has been long out of print, that portion thereof dealing with parliamentary procedure is pnnted as an Appendix to this publication. The follow - ing is a very bnef summary of it — f 37 1 — — 1 36 1 —"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"7. All business is brought before the meeting in the _______ form of a motion. Discussion will fallow the presentation and seconding of the motion. In connection with the consideration of a motion the Master should remernber: I~U (1) Two independent original propositions cannot be presented at this same time. When the Lodge is con - sidering a motion, only a subsidiary motion may be entertained. These subsidiary motions are to lie on the table, to postpone indefinitely, to postpone to a day cer - tarn, to commit and to amend. The motions have pre- —~ cedence in the order named. (2) The motion to amend is the most common and ________ liable to confront a Master. “A” makes a motion and then “B” makes a motion to amend “A’s” motion. The vote is taken upon the amendment first. If the amend - ment be adopted, then the question will be upon “As” motion as amended. If the amendment be lost, the question will be upon “As” motion as originally made. 8. The foregoing brief autline should be supplement - ed by some further study by the Mastei. Examination of Roberts Rules of Order and Masonic Parliamentary Law will give a Master sufficient information to avoid parliamentary difficulties. Presiding officers should always remember to keep a cool head, do not get in - volved in personalities, use good common sense and remember that “peace and harmony and charity of thought and deed are paramount to all else.” 9. Merely knowing the procedure to conduct a meet - ing will not save a Master from difficulty if he is totally ignorant of substantive Masonic law. The Master should know if a proposal or contemplated action is contrary to the established law of Masonry in this junsdiciton. In the next section we will, therefore, consider the subject of Masonic Law. Refer to Section 2038, C.M.C., for the additional pro - vision relative to time of opening. (3) Brethren desinng to speak should address the Master, and the Master will indicate who is entitled to (C)—Masonic Law the floor. 1 The knowledge a Master has about conducting a stated meeting must be supplemented with an under - standing of Masonic law. It is the duty of a Master Ia see that his Lodge conducts its affairs according to the Ancient Landmarks of the Order as well as the Consti - l~:m tution and Ordinances of Grand Lodge. Without some knowledge of Masonic legal principles, a Master may permit the presentation and discussion of some proposi - tion which should on presentation have been ruled out of order by the Master as contrary to the basic law of the Fraternity. In addition, between meetings, the Master is continually presented with problems requiring an — [ 39 1 — (4) A brother should not be interrupted by any other brother, eKcept for the purpose of calling him to order.

If the Master dces not control the debate in this respect, the discussion may end in complete confusion. Argu - ment should be restricted to the particular question under consideration. The Master should be particularly careful to see that debate is limited in this respect. — 1 38 1 —"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"2. Fortunately for officers of Masonic Lodges in Cali - fornia, all of the Masonic law in this state is collected in a single volume, Previously it was contained in Cahfor - nia Masonic Code Annotated.

Each Master, Warden, Marshal and Deacon should possess the California Masonic Code abbreviat - ed “C M.C.” There is no sound reason why the Lodge should not furnish the officers with this book, if the offi - cers do not personally own one. In any event, it is essential that each senior officer should possess this in - valuable book. I~m u~. w~u I~=m I~zu r~u L~ZU made to learn its contents. It is essential that a start be made prior to the year of service as Master. Committing to memory any portion of its contents is not required. The Master should develop the ability to locate in the volume the particular portion applicable to the problem confronting the Master. To acquire this ability requires an acquaintanceship with the contents of C M C. Edicts are the decisions of the Grand Master adopted by Grand Lodge. Since the formation of Grand Lodge in 1850, there naturally have been a great number of these decisions. A Resolution is the adoption by Grand Lodge of the report of a committee on some particular problem Since the business of Grand Lodge must be referred to and reported upon by a committee before it can be finally acted upon, unless by unanimous con - sent, all proposals enacted by Grand Lodge are in the form of Resolutions. These have been collected and revised, and appear as annotations to the pertinent sec - tions of the Constitution and Ordinances. Some planned course of reading or study should be followed by the officer. An outline of a course of reading is here suggested to assist the officer in comprehending the subject of Masonic law. The reading should be done over a period ol time Do not try to do it all at once The reader should make notes as he progresses in his read - ing.

Read carefully pages 56-57 giving a brief sum - mary of the basic Masonic law condensed from Mack - ey’s Junsprudence. 5. Then read the “Old Charges” and the “General Regulations,” pages 23-56. In general, the “Old Char - ges” deal with the nghts and duties of an individual brother and his relations to his Lodge and brethren. The “General Regulations” deal with the conduct of the Craft as a whole. The ‘Charges” and “General Regula - tions” are only interesting from an histoncal standpoint, as there are very few present-day problems not cover - ed by specific laws of Grand Lodges. 6. In connection with the further study of the Ca]Afor - nia Masonic Code, it is necessary to remember that the book as printed reflects the several items of Constitution and Ordinances in effect when the Code was adopted and published in 1975. Each year since that publica - tion, there have been enacted new provision which change, or amplify, the provisions which were in effect in 1975 These changes are set out in Ihe cumulative supplement which is published following each Annual Communication. The current supplement, published each year, includes all changes which have occurred during the period from 1975 to the dale of publication. In using Ihe Code, it is essential that a copy of the latesi I I I U’ 12 II~ I - 1= I~ur~ U supplement be obtained and referred to. 7. Having completed the general foundation for Ma - sonic jurisprudence, attention should next be given to the particular enactments of the Grand Lodge of Cali - fornia. Read the Constitution of Grand Lodge, Sections 1-508, C.M.C These eleven articles constitule the fun - damental organic law of the Grand Lodge of Califor - nia. As the Constitution of the United States is brief as compared with all the other laws enacted under its gen - eral provisions, so the Constiiution of Grand Lodge is short, and the Ordinances contain the greater part of the enactments. 8. Next in order, read the Ordinances, Sections 1000- 4008, C.M.C. The Ordinances are divided into four parts, relatLve to Grand Lodge, Constituent lodges, Trials and Restorations and Amendments. Because all of the Edicts and Resolutions now appear as Annota - tions to the Ordinances, there is no reason why the Ordinances should not be read and studied in the se - quence in which they appear ~n C.M.C. 9. Having completed the text, the officer should then carefully acquaint himself with the excellent index start - ing on page 249, and continuing for some 200 pages. No Master is required to know by memory all Masonic law in the ]unsdiction o[ California, but it is incumbent upon him to be able to use the index so as to locate a section of the law, or decision applicable to the problem at hand District officers’ meetings can be utilized to solve hypothetical problems Officers will gain experience in the use of the index in solving such problems. — [ 42 1 — — 43 1 —"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"10.

As a final suggestion, the Master should take pride in being able to answer and solve a problem. Ridiculous is the boast of some Masters that they need not know Masonic law because they can always get the answer from a Secretary, Past Master oi Inspector. Some even wiite letters to the Grand Master and Grand Secretary when the answei could have been easily found, had they but opened the volume of California Masonic Code Likewise, the officer who copies his brother officers answers to the questions prepared by the Grand Lecturer to qualify for his certificate is only doing harm to himself.

Preliminary to the actual balloting, there must of course be the receipt of an application properly prepar - ed and presented The form of application for degrees is available from the Grand Secretary’s office The first thing for the Masler to determine is whether his Lodge has jurisdiction to accept the application.

The Lodge should consider the advisability of fixing a minimum length of time of acquaintanceship before a brother is qualified to recommend. The disagreeableness of rejection may be avoided in many instances if recommendors are reminded of the essential qualifications for membership and advised to be careful in their proposal of an applicant 3. The applicatLon having been regularly received, the next duty of the Master is to appoint an Invesligating Committee. This is the Master’s duty and not that of the Secretary or any other officer It is one of the most im - portani of the Master’s duties. Care should be exercised in the selection of the Committees to choose not only men who know what qualifications the applicant should have, but also men who will attend to the inves - tigation promptly and report before the next stated meeting The Master should impiess upon the Comittee the necessity of prompt action. The entire invesUgation is a confidential matter, the members of the Committee being known only to the Master and the report is made directly to the Master and the report is made directly to the Master and no one else. Review here the excellent discussion in Section 2638 and 2640 C M.C, regarding the Master’s duty in connection with investigations. 4 Many Lodges supplement the work of the Investi - — 45 1 — — 44 1 —"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"gating Committee with an informal committee compos - ed of the officers and other competent members. The applicant is asked to appear before the group and in - quiry is made into his qualifications. The Master of course, conducts these meetings, It should not be used as a star-chamber session, but to impress upon the ap - plicant the fact that Masonry requires a petitioner to meet certain standards. It can increase the petitioners regard for the fraternity and gives him the chance to meet additional members of the Lodge. 5. There are two questions which are likely to arise in connection with applications. One is the matter of phys - ical qualifications which has been so fully covered in the decisions that nothing need be added Read Section 2600-2602 (Supp) C.M.C. 6. The othei question deals with a man’s financial condition. Not only should a man be physically, mental - ly and morally qualified to become a Mason, but he should also have sufficient financial worth to meet his obligations and not likely to become a charge on the Lodge. Misfortune overtakes many individuals who were in comfortable circumstances when they joined the Lodge We do not, of course, place any premium on wealth. Nevertheless, the history of Lodges is replete with cases of men taken into the fold without careful examination and who with their family become shortly thereafter recipients of relief. This consideration em - phasizes the piopriety of becoming acquainted with the family of an applicant and seeing that they fully under - stand the functions of the fraternity with reference of relief. This is a delicate matter to handle, but tactfully and carefully considered, it may save the Lodge con - siderable expense. m~. L~U L~U 7. The “law of the ballot” is clearly defined. Read Sections 2644-2658, CM.C. The procedure is fully ex - plained, and the ritual for the ballot is contained in the monitorial work for the stated meetings. 8. The Master should be particularly careful to see that al] the brethren vote. It has been ruled that the Master has no power to excuse a brother from voting. The custom in some Lodges of permitting those who desire to do so to approach the altar and vote should be severely frowned upon Such a practice may seriously interfere with the principle of unanimous approval upon which the fraternity has been built. All brethren present should actually take part in the balloting. 9. The matter of group balloting and reballoting is clearly explained in the pertinent sections of the Ordi - nances Section 2652, C.M.C. 10. The application for affiliation and the procedure is likewise clearly set forth. See Section 2692 C.M.C. II. The term “ballot” as applied to voting on appli - cants for degrees refers to a ballot by cubes and balls When balloting is referred to in other sections, it means a secret vote by slips of paper. Thus on a petition for restoration of a member suspended for two years for non-payment of dues, the vote must be by ballot. See Section 2820 C.M.C The ballot is secret as hereinbefore explained. Note that the election of officers is also by bal]ot, which necessarily should be secret. However, the Lodge by unanimous consent, may permit any des - ignated officer to cast the ballot for the Lodge.

The law regarding visiting and avouchment is found in Sections 2412-2420, C.M.C. 2. When a visitor presents himself to the Tiler, the latter should introduce the brother to the Master if he is available. The first matter to be determined is whether the visitor is in good standing in a Lodge of a recogniz - ed jurisdiction, If the brother is in good standing and vouched f or, then he is ready to be admitted H no one can vouch for him, then he should be examined pri - vately under the test oath It is the Master, not the Tiler, who appoints the Committee and care should be exer - cised in the appointment of the brethren to conduct the examination. The test oath is found in the Monitor and Officers Manual, Page 48 3. The Committee should be admonished and warn - ed that their purpose and duty 15 to ascertain whether the visitor is a Master Mason That is their only duty and not to see how much of the work the visitor or the Com - mittee does or dces not know It is highly discourteous for a Committee to give a visitor a grueling examination -I - ~z. r~u or “the third degree” (in the colloquial sense). Now and then, an examining committee has to deal with a visitor who has not been to Lodge for many years and his knowledge of Masonry is very slight. The Committee then faces a more difficult task. In most cases, however, it should only take a few minutes to asoertain whether the visitor is a Master Mason. 4. The Lodge should adopt some card index system of visitors, so that it will be easy to locate date of visitation if the visiting brother visits again. Attention should also be given to the notification of the home Lodge of the visitor of his visit to your lodge. Both index cards and notification cards may be obtained from the Grand Sec - retarys office. 5. The Master, or a reception committee, should see that the visitot is given a cordial greeting by the mem - bers of the Lodge A brother should sit with the visitor and introduce him to several members of the lodge His presence might be noted by the Master from the East, and if the occasion permits, he might be called on to speak The quality of a Lodge is reflected in the friendli - ness exhibited toward visitors (F)—Dues and Dimits 1 The life blood of a Lodge is its dues Without ade - quate financial support, the other functions of a Mason - ic Lodge cannot be properly performed. A considerable portion of the Masters time and effort is devoted there - fore, to matters in connection with the dues problem. There are five phases of the dues problem. life member - ship, collection of dues, remissions, suspensions and restorations — 1 48 ] — — 1 49 1 —"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"3 The collection of dues is a continuing problem of each and every Master. Theoretically, there should be no difficulty. Members are required by law to pay their dues quarterly in advance. H they are not paid, then the member is subject to suspension. As a practical matter, however, it is not simple. We have to continually re - mind our brethren of the necessity and value of retain - ing their membership and check them to see that they do not become delinquent in the payment of their dues. The Secretary of the Lodge is the collecting official. The Master as the chief executive officer should supervise the matter of collections, and be periodically informed as to the number and extent of delinquent members. It is absolutely necessary for the Master and Secretary to have the assistance of a Delinquent Dues Committee. The whole subject of collection of dues, importance of direction by Master and assistance of Delinquent Dues Committee has been so adequately treated in several regulations that each Master should read Sections 2812- 4 N I I I a U :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 4. Remission of dues is a function which the Lodge exercises but in which the Master plays an important role. The Master should know the reason why a mem - ber is~not paying his dues. the Delinquent Dues Com - mittee can assist the Master in getting this information. When the Master has ascertained the fact that the brother is unable to pay there is a positive duty to have the Lodge remit the dues of such member. In order to save payment of Grand Lodge dues for such member, remission covering twelve months ending June 30th of current yeqr must be made at the Stated Meeting in June. For pertinent provisions in the law regarding re - missions, see Section 2810, C.M.C. and annotations thereto. A Master is called upon to exercise good sound judgment in the matter of remissions, being syrnpa - thetic to those who need assistance and at the same time being stem with those who can find money for unessential expenditures and fail to pay their dues. 2. Current statistics show that many of the Lodges have life membership funds. Of course, there is no problem of collection in connection with such funds. It is a question of administration. The enabling sections for these life memberships are Sections 2804 and 2806, C.M.C. Sections 2302 and 2302d (supp.) and 2304, C.M.C., provide what investments may be made with the funds. The use of said funds is definitely restricted by Section 2306, C.M.C., permitting the Lodge to use only the income with the “original amounts to be for - ever kept and maintained as and for a permanent life membership fund.” The permanency of the contribu - tions to the fund has been the subject of much discus - sion in Grand Lodge. 2820, C.M.C. thoroughly. Note particularly the sugges - tiorij—-that the Secretary mail quarterly notices and the various steps which should be taken as outlined in Sec - tion 2816, C.M.C. The Master who sees that his Lodge follows the suggested procedure will eliminate the proble~rr of the two- and three-year delinquent mem - bers with whom so many Lodges are troubled. g~u 5. Suspension of a member should only be in order after all methods to avert this penalty have been tried. Experience has shown that the great majority of sus - pensed members stay suspended, lost to Masonry for - ever. Of course, suspension is had only after following in strict form the procedure set forth in Section 2814, C.M C. Extreme care should be taken by the Master that no one, entitled to remission of dues, is unjustly —l 511 — — 1501 —"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"suspended We must be realistic, however, and know that there are members who lose entirely their interest in and regard for Masonry, and who do not wish to pay up their dues to take a dimit In such cases, there is no alternative but suspension. There are also a few breth - ren who need the “jolt” of suspension to make them realize the necessity of keeping in good standing. Such cases are very few. The best way to avoid unnecessary suspensions is to institute an effective dues collection system as suggested in paragraph 3 6. Restoration to membership is either absolute or discretionary Within two years a member has the absolute right to be restored upon payment of the arrearages and accrued dues Section 2818, C.M C After two years his restoration requires a two-thirds vote by ballot of all members present at a Stated Meet - ing, Section 2820, C M C In connection with restora - tion, the Master should remember that the opportunity still exists after suspension to remit dues. True it is that remissions after suspension should be done with cau - tion but circumstances may make such action desir - able Real effort should be expended to effect restora - tions and return brethren to the rolls of Masonry 7. The matter of dimits is closely allied to the question of dues. There is nothing complicated about this Sec - tion 2432, C.M.C., sets forth the method for dimitting The recipient of the dimit should be advised, however, as to his limited rights as a dimited Mason See Section 2406, C M C. (G)—Funds cmd Property of Lodges 1 The funds and property of Lodges are trust funds in -lj~ . -I : -1- - uI~ the highest sense. The funds may be used only for (a) Necessary expenses of the Lodge (b) Masonic relief. (c) Entertainment (limited, not to exceed 30% of total revenue). See Annotation 2322k, C M.C., for limitations on the amount available. (d) Certain specified expenditures, such as expenses of officer attending Grand Lodge, testimonial for retir - ing Master and flowers for ill or deceased brethren. The Master is continually facing the task of deciding whether a contemplated expenditure is permitted. There is also the question whether the expenditure can be considered as part of the “necessary expenses or whether it must be charged to the Entertainment Fund Thus, it has been decided that the purchase of lambskin aprons to present to candidates are a neces - sary expense. The Master should therefore acquaint himself with the Regulations on this subject, there being quite a number of decisions dealing with the question of proper and improper expenditures. Sections 2316, 2318 and 2320, C M.C 2. The most practical suggestion which can be made to assist Masters in the matter of Lodge expenditures is the advisability of preparing and using a budget The Lodge should be operated so that the necessary ex - penses, relief and entertainment are less than the in - come. This is just sound business sense. This plan of operation means that the capital of the Lodge increases — 52 I — — 53 1 —"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"each year. There is no way of budgeting the amount to be expended for relief, but the amount to be expended during a year for other matters may be defiriitely fixed. Unless there are extraordinary relief demands, such a budget plan will mean that the funds of the Lodge (pri. manly for relief) will be increased annually rather than be depleted. As Lodges become older, the membership gets older and the demands for assistance naturally become greater. Lodges should, therefore, be conser - vative with their funds and be prepared to meet un - usual relief requests if the occasion should require. If the Master is fortunate in having an accountant in the Lodge, he should request his assistance in preparing a budget. In fact, a Budget Committee can render a real service. Comparative figures are most helpful A Mas - ter should have before him the detailed expenditures of the previous year or years, and then prepare his es - timate for the pending year. It is suggested that the Master should have the information and budget estimates in the following form (figures taken from a metropolitan Lodge of about five hundred members). A more detailed list of expenditures would be even more preferable. — ~54l — a U U OISBURSEMENrs Contributions paid G L $ 655 or $ 540 00 Fees & Contribution Returned 160 00 295 00 Degree Fees & Per Capita Paid 0 L 1.59475 1,62930 Endowment collections PaidO L 96200 1,00500 Social Security & tinemply Taxes 85 50 36 00 Reliet 1.98760 2.03250 Salaries 2.130 00 2,080 00 Rent 1.25000 1.37500 Printing & Postage 635 19 642 23 Aprons & Laundry 53 70 39 85 Entertainment 2.061 00 1.902 85 Miscellaneous Expense 18740 20315 TOTAL $11,762 14 $1180088 NetClam $ 4991 NetLoss $ 11408 Note that in each of the above years. the expenditures for entertainment were kept to appiomamately two-thirds at the mainmum permissible Greater expendi - tures would have had to be made tram the reserve hinds 3. A fundamental proposition in connection with Lodge funds is that with the exception of the Life Mem - bership fund, they cannot be segregated or ear - marked. All of the Lodges’ assets constitute a common fund for the purposes heretofore designated. 4. Another basic principle is that the trustees are always subject to the control of the Lodge. Likewise, the actions of the trustees are subject to the desires of the Lodge. See Section 2308, C.M.C.

The title to the funds and property of the Lodge should be vested in the name of the Lodge and not the trustees By civil law, the Lodge may acquire title to property and with the title in the name of the Lodge difficult questions of transfer on the death of trustees might be avoided. Section 2308. 6 The matter of entertainment funds has received extensive consideration by Grand Lodge. See Section 2322 C M C., for interpretations of what is included in total revenue. 7 The particular sections dealing with funds and property of Lodges are Sections 2300-2326. These should receive careful reading by the Master. In con - sidering investments, refer to Section 2302-2304, C.M.C. (H)—Triczls 1. The trial of a member for a Masonic offense is not a frequent occurrence. However, when such action is necessary, the Master should be thoroughly acquainted with provisions of the law regarding the filing of charges, right of the accused to have a full trial or plead guilty and have the Master determine the guilt and penalty, election of trial commissioners, service of summons, trial, and subsequent proceedings In 1957 a drastic change was made in the procedure for a Masonic trial. Prior to that time it was necessary to hold a fuliscale trial whether the acc~used pleaded guilty or not guilty Now if the accused pleads guilty, or fails to file any answer, then the Master, or Trial Master, has the duty of making a complete investigation, determin - ing whether the charge and specifications are true, malang a finding as to the guilt or innocence of the — 56 ] — 5 - ~zu ezm p~. accused, and if guilty, fixing the penalty. In addition, he must have prepared a written record of the facts he has discovered and his determination of the case lithe accused pleads not guilty, then the Master must take the necessary steps for the election of trial commissi on - ers and a full trial It is therefore absolutely necessary for every Master to be familiar with the provisions of the California Masonic Code relating to the trial of a mem - ber. See Section 3348, C.M C, for designation of Trial Master. 2 Immediately upon lea ming that a disciplinary ac - tion is coming up, the Master, or the Secretary at the Masters instruction, should communicate the facts to the Grand Secretary. The latter will then provide the necessary forms and instructions applicable to the ap - prop date type of procedure. The first duty of a Master upon receipt of written charges is to determine whether the Lodge has jurisdiction, and whether the charges constitute a Masonic offense. This is the initial and pri - mary duty of the Master. The violation of the Ancient Landmarks, of the constitution or regulations of Grand Lodge, of the By-Laws of the Lodge or of any portion of the Masonic or moral law, constitutes a Masonic of - fense See Sections 3300-3314, C.M.C. The Master may reject Involous or non-Masonic charges, or strike out or amend any portion of specifications not pertinent. 3. The next duty of the Master is to see that one copy of the charges is forwarded to the Grand Secretary and that one copy of the charges, together with a Notice of Filing Charges, is served upon the accused The notice must be given by using the form provided by the Grand Secretary The notice advises the accused to file his answer, either guilty or not guilty, and notifies him that — [ 57 ] —"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"if he tails to file such written statement, further pro - ceedings will be taken against him, without any further notice. The time allowed the accused by the notice, and the manner of service, are set forth in Section 3358, C.M.C. 4 Unless the accused files a plea of ‘not guilty,” the Master most make a complete investigation, and de - termine the matter as set forth in Section 3340, C.M.C. Read that section very carefully and be sure that a complete and adequate record is prepared, noting particularly that ALL THE FACTS supporting the Mas - ters determination of guilt or innocence should be fully set forth. Section 3340 reads as follows~ Sec. 3340. PROCEDURE IF ACCUSED FAILS TO PLEAD NOT GUILTY, OR PLEADS GUILTY. If within the time provided for in the notice hereinbefore in this Article specified, the accused shall not have filed in writing with the Secretary of the Lodge his plea of not guilty, the Master of said Lodge or the Trial Master, as the case may be, shall personally make a complete investigation and shall determine whether the charge and specifications are true, causing the facts relating thereto to be reduced to writing, in triplicate, and he shall make a finding as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, and shall fix the penalty therefor Upon such finding and determination of penalty he shall cause one copy of the complete written record to be forwarded to the Grand Secretary and shall cause one copy thereof to be filed in the archives of the Lodge. At the next stated meeting of the Lodge the Trial Master shall announce his findings and the penalty imposed by him.

Upon the filing by the accused of a written plea of guilty to the charge the Trial Master may make a finding of guilt without further investigation, but may make any such investigation as he feels nec - essary and shall, in his report to the Lodge, de - termine the penalty. An accused may, at any time before a verdict is rendered by the Trial Commission, change a plea of not guilty to one of guilty as herein provided, whereupon the Trial Master shall dismiss the Commissioners and proceed in the manner pro - vided fork cases wherein a guilty plea was origi - nally entered by the accused Crass References Pawers af Master. §2526, Pracedure an receipt af charges. l~i4, Trial Master, §ii48 ANNOTATIONS §3 3 40a.

Previously, tt was the duty of the Master to preside at the trial, and it was therefore incumbent upon him to know the provisions of the law and the duty of a ludge in determining what evidence should or should not be admitted. At the present time, under Section 3348, C.M.C., the Grand Master appoints the Trial Master whose duty it is to preside at the trial. As a practical matter, if the Master of the Lodge feels that he is qual - ified to act as a Trial Master, and is not disqualified from presiding, the Grand Master will appoint him as Trial Master. If a Master feels that he is qualified, and de - cides that he would like to act as a Trial Master, he must spend time and effort in prepring himself to conduct the proceedings. He must carefully read the section of the law regarding Masonic trials. Particular care should be taken to see that the established procedure is strictly followed. The imposition of penalties is a serious matter, and an accused brother is entit]ed to all the protection given to him by the law of Masonry. 6. What help or assistance in connection with trials can the Master look for? Even though a Master decides that he will not act as the Trial Master, it is still incum - bent upon him to handle the proceedings until the trial actually commences. In fact, tf the accused pleads guilty, or files no answei, the Master, if appointed Trial Master, has the sole responsibility of deciding the mat - ter There is no substitute for knowing what the law actually provides, so the Master’s primary responsibil - ity is to read and understand Sections 3300-3501, C M C 7 Some time ago, the auThor assisted the Giand Secretary’s office in the preparation of a Masonic Trial Outline This outline is sent by the Grand Secretary’s — 1 60 1 — g::g I~. office to the Master with the forms and instructions for - warded on receiving notice of impending disciplinary action The outline is not intended as a substitute for the pertinent provisions of the C M C It does give, how - ever, an orderly outline of each step which should be followed from the time charges are prepared until the record is completed and sent to the Grand Secretary, together with any notice of appeal The pertinent sec - tions of the C.M C. are noted opposite each suggested step.

The annual communication gives the Master or other Lodge representative the opportunity to meet Grand Lodge officers personally. This personal contact does much to humanize and personalize what olherwise might seem a most august body of men. 2 The composition, powers and functions of Grand Lodge are set forth on pages 35-49 C.M.C. An exam - ination of these sections will give the Master the basic law for the composition, powers and duties of Grand Lodge 3. Between annual communications the Grand Master exercises all of the executive powers of Grand Lodge Masters of Lodges usually have the opportunity of knowing Ihe Grand Master personally, as all recent Grand Masters bave endeavored to visit as many Ma - sonic Districts as possible in the junsdiction This gives the Masters a chance to know the Grand Masler before the communication. 4 The other Grand Lodge office, with which contact is most generally had, is that of the Grand Secretary. This office can be ol real assistance to a Lodge because the Grand Secretary’s office has a most complete set of Masonic records and data. Almost any information of a historical or statistical nature can be supplied Of most assistance is the supply of forms and publications available for Lodge use The following are items from the list of publications with which all Masters should be acquainted: 5~m Constitution and By-Laws (to be presented to Newly Raised Members) Monitor and Officers’ Manual California Masonic Code Funeral Service Installation Service Masonic Law and Customs Cards for Registration of all Visitors Sacred Roll for Funeral Service Handbook for Candidates Coaches.

A practical suggestion would be for him to read the Proceedings of the pre - vious or several preceding communications. This will acquaint him with the business transacted and the procedure followed. The Proceedings of Grand Lodge are an unusual source of Masonic knowledge Each Lodge in the jurisdiction ieceives one copy of the Proceedings. In most Lodges it is filed away Ln some inaccessible file in the Secretary’s office. It is suggested and recommended that the Master and Wardens (and such other officers as wish) be required to read the Proceedings. By reading such Proceedings an officer will note the importance of committee work in Grand Lodge All business, unless by unanimous consent, is referred to and reported upon by a committee before it is acted upon by Grand Lodge. Lodges or Masters having some resolution to present should be prepared to appear before some committee to support their par - ticular proposal. See list of standing committees with their duties enumerated in Sections 1200-1250, C.M C. 6. All resolutions finally reach the floor of Grand Lodge for a vote after consideration by the committees Every member of Grand Lodge has the pnvilege of expressing his opinion Masters are therefore urged to take the floor and speak for or against some resolution in which they are interested or upon which they desire to comment. The most effective talks in Grand Lodge have been made by members from the floor. Masters, Wardens and Representatives should have no reti - cence to rise and express their opinions 7. The elective officers of Grand Lodge are the Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wardens, Grand Treasurer, Grand Secretary and Grand Lecturer. The —-7 . 7 - election is held on the final day of the communication. Like most Lodge elections, the officers are usually ad - vanced without competitive election. Unlike the Consti - tuent Lodges, however, the Senior Grand Deacon is not advanced The office of Junior Grand Warden is the first step or office leading to the station of Grand Master and the office is filled by election It is customary not to have any nominations for this office. This might seem a little confusing to a Master since in order to elect there must be a majonty vote f-low does the Master get to know the possible candidates for Junior Grand Warden? The Past Grand Masters, and three members of this Grand Lodge to be appointed annually by the Grand Master to serve for a single teim and who are not past or present elected Grand Officers, shall constitute a committee to recommend to the Grand Lodge a mem - ber thereof for election as Junior Grand Warden. The recommendee, alternately, shall be a member of a Lodge in the North and of a Lodge in the South The name of the recommendee and his biographical sketch shall be sent to each Inspector, and may be sent to such other members of the Grand Lodge as the Grand Mas - ter may determine. All dissemination of this information thereafter shall be oral and not by any other means of reproduction It is expected that the information shall be communicated promptly and as often as necessary by the Inspectors to the Masters and Wardens of each Inspectoral Distnct and through them to other members of the Giand Lodge in their respective Lodges Immediately pnor to the election of the Junior Grand Warden, the Grand Master shall read the biographical sketch of the recommendee and if the recommendee be — [ 70 1 — — 1 71] —"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"present, the Grand Master shall introduce him. (Section 200 supp.) Masters can receive assistance from their Inspectors in this matter of the selection of a Junior Grand Warden as well as with other Grand Lodge problems confront - ing them. 8. It is also suggested that the Master report to his Lodge the transactions of the Grand Lodge communica - tion. The next stated meeting after the communication provides a good time for such report. Some of the high - lights of the session or particular matters in which the Lodge is interested should be covered in the report It will make the operations of Grand Lodge more under - standable to the brethren of the Lodge. (J)—Lodge Bulletins and Publications I The membership must be kept informed of Lodge activities The duty thus devolves upon the Master to see that an interesting and informative Lodge publ~~ cation is provided The Master’s duties are so extensive that he should call on some other brother to act as editor Nevertheless, the Master should keep in close touch with the editonal staff to see that the bulletin contains attractive matenal. It is the information me - dium of the Lodge, and the more attractive the publi~ cation the better will be the attendance at Lodge 2 See Section 2072 Supp, C.M C, second para - grapb, for the change in the regulations as adopted in the 1976 Communication, to permit the publication of names of Applicants and of Candidates 3 Masters should not overlook the value of including II personals about the membership There is nothing a member likes better than to see his name in print. Personal items give the opportunity to do so. Some Lodges run monthly lists of members’ birthdays or anniversanes of becoming Master Masons. Such schemes are commendable for they bring the breth - rens’ names into pnnt 4. The bulletin should contain news of the Lodge and Masonic items of general interest Bulletins should be exchanged with other Lodges Articles and items from other publications may be used, always giving credit to the bulletin from which the repnnt is made It is de - sirable, of course, that Masonic news items and articles be used instead of those of general interest 5. It perhaps is superfluous because of the great pub - licity heretofore given to it, to add that no paid adver - tising may be included in the bulletins. The Master should acquaint himself with the provisions of Section 2072 Supp, C M.C. which provides that no Lodge or membex of a Lodge shall solicit, sponsor, insert, place or print advertising of any kind in or for any medium or publication which purports to be Masonic in name or character, or which is published by or for any Body, Order or Organization requiring Masonic affiliation as a condition to membership. 6. In connection with publications, the Master should become acquainted with CALIFORNIA FREEMASON, as it is the only official publication of the Grand Lodge of California. It not only contains reports of the Grand Lodge officers, but gives a review of Grand Lodge ac - tivities and news items from various sections of the state. — 1 72 ] — — 1 73 ] —"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The cuirent procedure is for one copy of each issue of the CALIFORNIA FREEMASON to be mailed to each member of a Lodge in this junsdiction. The cost of such mailing is included in the Grand Lodge budget. (K)—Cemmittees 1. There is an excellent opportunity in the matter of committee work to cieate interest among the brethren of the Lodge. Although the Master remains the chief ex - ecutive officer, and should supervise all activities, the details should be handled through committee assign - ments. The appointment of a considerable number of brethren to committees gives such brethren an active part in Lodge affairs and naturally increases their inter - est in the Lodge There is possibility for any number of committee appointments A list of the committees usual - ly found in Masonic Lodges would include Coaching, Delinquent Dues, Mditing, Entertainment, Masonic Homes, Refreshments, Relief, Sick, Reception, Endow - ment Fund, Editorial, Masonic History, Sojourners, Public School, Masonic Information and Responsil~ility 2. The names of the committee members should be published often in the Lodge bulletin or other Lodge publication. Publicity given to committee appointments is flattenog to members of the committee. 3. There might be worked out a schedule of commit - tee assignments for each “line” officer in the Lodge Such officer should not ordinanly act as chairman of the committee but merely serve as an active member thereof. Such a schedule would mean that each officer would have some direct contact with every activity of the Lodge. By the time an officer reaches the station of I:: m U p S Master, he will thus have had active participation in all of the activities This experience will be most helpful to him. A suggested list of committee assignments for the officers would be as follows Master Senior Warden Junior Warden Chaplain Senior Deacon Junior Deacon Marshal Senior Steward Junior Steward Relief Relief and Delinquent Dues Candidate Coaching Relief and Auditing Public Schools Entertainment Editorial Masonic Homes Endowment Coaching Entertainment and Refreshment The foregoing schedule is merely an example of a schedule of appointments A different schedule will accomplish the same purpose as long as an officer covers all of the important committees during the time he advances from Junior Steward to Senior Warden IV—RELIEF Thus far we have considered the obligations of a Master in connection with the ritualistic work and the executive duties. We now examine the duties of a Mas - ter in connection with relief to be administered by a Masonic Lodge In the final analysis, relief is probably the most important activity of the Lodge All of the funds of the Lodge are to be conserved for use in relieving the distress of a worthy brother and his family. Expendi - tures for charity may require the use of all of the funds. — [ 74 ] — — 1 75 1 —"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Since chanty occupies this preferred position in Lodge activities, it is natural that a goodly portion of the Mas - ter’s time should be consumed in handling charity and relief matters. The method of dispensing charity has undergone radical change in recent years. The giving of money may not be so important as assisting an un - fortunate brother to be self-supporting (by locating employment for him) There should be a modern treat - ment of relief matters What, therefore, are the Master’s duties in regard to relief and how may he meet these demands? (A)—Relief by the Lodge 1 The Master sbould never forget the fact that there are two members on the Charity Committee besides himself and that his Senior and Junior Wardens are the other members of the Committee. See Article X of the By-Laws, Many Masters make the very senous mistake of dispensing relief without the knowledge or advice of the Wardens. By discussing and advising with the War - dens in regard to relief matters, the Master accom - plishes two things: He gets the benefit of their counsel and, most of all, he gives them some expenence in handling charity problems It gives a Warden knowledge of what relief has been expended for the two years prior to bis year as Master. The value of educating the Wardens in this connection cannot be overestimated. As noted in Section 2086n, C M.C., all disbursements by the Master and Wardens as the Charity Committee must be reported to the Lodge. 2. Masters should never take for granted that relief ± 7 - payments made in the past should continue in the fu - ture. Many Lodges have regular “stipendiaries.” Upon taking office, each Master with his committee should re-examine each case to see if there bas been any change in the status of the recipient and if the amount provided should be increased or decreased. An annual investigation of these regular cases is an absolute necessity 3 Another common error is made in connection with the record of the investigation and disposition of each chanty demand Masonry rightfully pndes itself on the fact that when relief is given it is done without any publicity This does not mean, however, that there should be no record of any kind of the transaction, It is a senous mistake foi a Master to trust all the details to his memory This is particularly unwise if the recipients of relief make another request of the Lodge several years later and the Master is then asked wbat transpired during his term in office. There should be established some permanent record of the demands for relief, the report and facts found on the investigation of each case, and what relief assistance or advice was rendered Such records, highly confidential, should be kept some place accessible only to the Master and Secretary. In cases which continue over a long penod of time, a written record is of invaluable assistance. 4 There are two elements involved in every relief problem First, is the applicant entitled to assistance, and second, what aid should be rendered? Section 2900, C M C., provides that a Lodge must relieve its own members, their widows and orphans, wherever residing Dunng the lifetime of a member, technically he is the only one entitled to relief. However, circum - — 1 77 1 — — 1 76 ] —"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"stances may exist where relief may be extended to dependent relatives and thus relieve the brother him - self, who is responsible for their support A divorced wife is not considered as a dependent relative. Upon the death of a brother, his widow and orphans become entitled to assistance, if in need The obligation toward the widow ceases on her remarnage By resolution, the term “orphan” has been defined to mean a child below the age of twenty-one years Sojouming Masons, their widows and orphans in the turisdiction of the Lodge, are also entitled to necessary aid. 5. Having determined that the applicant is entitled to assistance, a more difficult question is presented in connection with the type of aid to be rendered Merely giving funds may not be the solution to the problem. Sound advice may remedy an unfortunate family situ - ation where money might continue it without change. Obtaining employment for a brother, if possible, will be a more satisfactory solution to a relief request than advancing money to such brother. The condition may be such as to require an application for admission to or outside relief from one of the Masonic homes. Financial assistance to a brother should be enough to keep him from want and yet not in an amount which would en - courage him to keep on the Lodge’s reliel rolls The determination of the amount to be advanced is an im - portant item for the Chanty Committee. 6. Some difficulty may confront a Master of a Lodge, not associated with a Masonic Service Bureau, in con - nection with a request for aid from a “sojouming” Mason. There is the hardship of determining that the applicant is a Mason in good standing. The advance - ment of funds to such Mason with the expectation of fE ~zIE reimbursement from the home Lodge of such Mason should be done only upon express authorization of his Lodge. Only nominal and temporary relief should be extended before the authorization is received In the reverse situation, where a member of your Lodge is located at a place distant from the Lodge, approval of relief extended to such brother should be specific and certain The amount to be advanced to the brother should be definitely stated, otherwise the Lodge may find itself obligated in a greater sum. 7 There is one principle to remember in all relief cases, namely, that the extension of aid is not depen - dent upon the worthiness of a brother. II the Lodge has not previously taken the necessary steps to expel or suspend a brother, where the circumstances would justify such action, then the Lodge must extend assis - tance if the brother requests assistance and is in need. See Section 2900c, C,M.C. 8 Perhaps the most frequent request made for relief is in connection with burials Many families, unin - formed in the matter, think that it is the duty of the Lodge to bury its members at the expense of the Lodge. When the occasion requires, this duty should be un - questionably assumed. In most cases, however, the circumstances do not necessitate action by the Lodge. Read the law regarding burial, Section 2906, C.M.C. 9 The Master should familianze himself with the sec - tions dealing with relief by the Lodge. Section 2900, C.M.C. and Annotations thereto. 10. A subject closely connected with relief is that of sickness. In many cases, financial assistance is not as necessary as a thoughtful visit by the Master of the — [ 79 1 — — 1 78 1 —"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Lodge. In making the suggestion that the Master call upon the sick brothei, the wnter is mindful of the fact that the Master of a large city Lodge has many de - mands upon his time. Nevertheless, if it is at all possible to make such a visit, the Master will be fulfilling one of the most important functions of his office in doing so. It is needless to say how great a benefit the Lodge will derive from the attitude of the brother who feels that he has been honored with a visit by the Master of his Lodge. It makes him feel that the Masonic teachings are not mere theoretical idealism but practical fratemalism. II the Master’s duties are too burdensome, the matter of the visits to sick brethren should be taken care of by an efficient and cheerful Sick Committee. Brethren who are ill may feel resentful toward a Lodge which does not evince some interest in their recovery and welfare. 11. As a final suggestion the Master should be care - ful of the funds of the Lodge, but at the same time be sympathetic with the brother requiring help. The sta - ture of a Master is measured by his thoughtful handling of distress among the members. Wherever possible, the Master should anticipate a request for assistance when he is apprised of a brother’s unfortunate circumstances. Ritual and executive ability of a Master is essential, but equally if not more important is an “understanding heart” to extend relief and assistance in an intelligent and helpful manner. Section 2904, C M.C., gives a concise description and explanation of the functions of the Masonic Service Buxeau A thorough understanding of this section will be of invaluable assistance in dealing with sojourning brethren --7 7 — u~m U (C)—Masenic Hemes 1 The crowning jewels of practical Masonry in Cal - ifornia are the Home for the Aged at Union City (for - merly Decoto) and the Home for Children at Covina. The information regarding these marvelous institutions has been extensively published All officers should be well acquainted with these Homes Matenal regarding the Homes is frequently received from the Endowment Board Much may be gained from reading the Annual Report of the Trustees of the Masonic Homes, published in the Annual Proceedings of Grand Lodge It would be well for the Master to acquaint himself with the last several reports of the Trustees. An effort should be maoe to visit these Institutions The opportunity to visit the iome at Union City is afforded to those attending Grand Lodge Masters residing in the South are close to the Covina Home A personal visit will indelibly im - press upon the officer the value of these Institutions to Masonry in California. 2 The Homes are operated by a Board of Trustees consisting of nine members.

Circumstances may call for assistance at home, rather than institutional care 4. The regular forms adopted by the Trustees must be used in making application for Relief These may be obtained from the office of the Masonic Homes, San Francisco, when required A careful examination of the forms will advise the Master of the steps necessary to complete the application. It will also give the Master some idea of the completeness of the information re - quired by the Trustees to pass upon the application The form will indicate what essential facts should be had by the Master before deciding upon all applications for aid, even though as complete a report is not necessary in all cases. 5 In connection with rules goveming admission to the Home for Children, Appendix page 237 of the C.M.C contains the latest revision. Familiarity with the form will assist in prompt completion In most instances, aid must be given promptly, and it is necessary thai the application be prepared in a short space of time. 6 Masters should be certain that the admission of an individual to the Homes dces not mean a severance of contact with such individual Regular visits, if possible, and at least a penodic letter will be most helpful. Gifts at Chnstmas and birthdays will make the recipient feel that the Lodge is cognizant of their wellare and they are not just inmates of an institution. 7.

(D)—Mcisonic Homes Endowment Board The operating expenses of the Masonic Homes are paid from several sources: first, the $25.00 paid by in - itiates and affiliates; second, the per capita tax on Lodges, third, the income from the Endowment Fund, and fourth, from incidental income. Purpose of the fund: To supplement the funds provided by Grand Lodge for the support of the Homes and to provide a definite source of income in times of depression or of inflation or of special need. The Endowrrient Board will supply plenty of material to acquaint the Master with the aims, purposes and standing of the Endowment Fund Read the many instructive pamphlets available from the Endowment Board, Report of Endowment Board published in Annual Proceedings and other ma - tenal prepared by the Board for the use of Lodges. All officers should be entirely familiar with the work of the Endowment Board 2. Once a Master is impressed with the fine work of the Endowment Board he will be more enthusiastic about the participation of the Lodges in the efforts to increase the amount of the Fund. The Master should see that the Lodge is informed of and participates in the annual Endowment month emphasis. The appointment of an effective committee will give this important work attention for the entire year rather than just a single month.

It is self-apparent that there must be prciper entertainment features to balance the serious side of Masonry. Entertainment should not be the main feature in Lodge activities. It should be pro - vided in moderation and in keeping with the ultimate aim and purpose of Masonry. The fact that there is a definite place for entertainment in the circle of Lodge activities means that the Master must devote some effort to it Many details in connection with entertainment cqn be delegated to others. The Master, however, should and must remain the source of authonty and direction. Otherwise, there is great danger of either expensive, dull or improper entertainment features Let us analyze the function of the Master in this respect.

It is important to have an active Committee with an energetic chairman. 3. Plans for entertainment should not be made hap - hazardiy as the year progresses. At the very outset of the year, major events should be tentatively arranged. Careful planning will prevent crowding too much entertainment into any one period and then having several months pass without some feature. It is not difficult to arrange a balanced years program pro - viding some thought is given to the matter before the year commences. How many meetings for the year are there to be considered? The average Lodge will prob - ably have Stated Meetings 12 Special Meetings (approximately) ... 30 Total 42 What events are more or less definitely fixed each year: Election of Officers Installation of Oflicers Public Schools Week Constitution Observance Past Masters Night Endowment Fund Program Official Visit of Inspector — [ 86 1 — U I S I m U U U U 3 3 U U U U I~5 What other possible programs can be planned: Fralemal Visit with Another Lodge . Youth Organizations 2 Thanksgiving Turkey Whist Father and Son Night Senior Warden’s Night Third Degree Examination Old Timers Night Speakers on Vital Subjects 3 Research Program 2 Lodge Anniversary Program Dinner Dance Masonic History Program .. . . Motion Picture (Commercial) The foregoing list is merely suggestive of the possible meetings which can be planned. If a Lodge has five or six candidates, there will be approximaely twenty to twenty-five meetings devoted to the confemnng of the degrees and officers’ rehearsal. The lemaining twenty meetings need not remain “dark nights” but can be used for some of the suggested entertainment features. 4 The Master should be mindful that a great deal of work is rquired in connection with each and every meeting which is planned. He should delegate the handling of the details to the Entertainment Committee. An effective program dces not just happen without careful planning and preliminary preparation. Spon - taneous events are usually failures. 5. When a speaker is scheduled the Master will probably have the duty of introducing the speaker and handling the meeting. Prior to the meeting the Master should see that ample announcement of the meetina is — [ 87 ] —"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"made, that transportation is provided for the guest speaker and that he is introduced personally to a num - ber of the brethren on his arnval at the Lodge. A bul - letin of the Masonic Education Committee contained such pointed admonitions for a Master and Chairman in connection with handling such a meeting that it is repeated here in full: “A Start the program on time A wait of fifteen or twenty minutes may kill an entire evening The audience becomes weary before the program begins “B Avoid lengthy preliminary exercises Remember, while the entertainment may be eiitoyable, the real event of the evening is the oddress Do not tire the oudience by overloading the program with music ond readings ond speeches by local brethren Two or three musical numbers with ten minutes of community singing under a competent leadei should meet all ordinary requirements And let the talent be the best available Move the program along snappily “C Give the speaker a suitable introduction to the audience Do not baldly announce his name and subject in a literal, cold - blooded manner This is like tossing him into a pool at cold water Nor should the chairman indulge in fulsome flattery and redundant adulation This embarrasses the speaker Tell something about the speaker, his work and achievements, in an informal, fnendly way, state his subject clearly, pronounce his name distinctly and present him to the audience with a smile A tactful introduction serves to put the speaker at his ease, awakens the sympathetic interest of the audience and goes f or toward creating the atmosphere in which the speakei can do his best “D Be sure the hall is well ventilated Bad air puts an audience to sleep Have hall or Lodge room bnghtly lighted, but there should be no lights behind the speaker to dazzle the eyes of the brethren The audience should be placed directly in front of the speaker Avoid the “hallow square” type of seating if possible ‘E Close early, certainly not later than 10 30 Do not let the proceedings drag Under ordinary circumstances adjoummeni should be had very soon after the address “F If the lecture is to be given an a degree night, it might be well — 1 88 1 — U U S S U :3 U 3 a :3 S U to make provision far the address at a dinner preceding the work If ho talk is to be given at the “refreshments” after the degree, tchodule the evening in such a way as to enable the speaker to bo~ln his remarks at a reasonable time It is not fair, either to the opociker or the brethren, to call upon him to speak at 11 o’clock or Iritor, when the brethren are tired and anxious to go home “G~ Frequently the lecture is given at a stated meeting, in which cow, arrangements should be made to permit the speaker to begin ttf least by 9 o’clock” 6. The final and probably most important suggestion In connection with entertainment is that the program l3hould be varied. Any program, cleverly arranged, may be dull and uninteresting due to the fact that it is performed every year in the same way without change. Brethren are attracted to meetings where the presen - tation is novel. This calls for the ingenuity of the Master and the Entertainment Committee. It requires hard work to evolve a program which has new features, but such effort will be repaid by increased attendance. There are innumerable programs more novel and in - teresting than those hereinbefore suggested, which are more or Jess standard. Alm to have as many attractive and unusual programs as possible, beanng in mind that since we are dealing with a Masonic Lodge, an interesting program with Masonic content is preferable to ordinary entertainment. (B)—Fincmcial Consideration. 1 Many programs suggested ir~ the preceding sec - lion can be provided without expending any kinds. Prominent and inspiring speakers may be obtained without any expense to the Lodge. Masters ought to try to curb the inclination to provide refreshments at all meetings The attraction of having refreshments (if a — 1 89 1 —"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"VI—CONCLUSION Lodge finds it necessary) loses its drawing power if it becomes a common and regular event. Effective pro - grams in many instances can be put on at no cost to the Lodge. 2. In planning the years program, it is essential for the Master to budget the amount which can be e~ - pended for social purposes. Such a budget will insure a proper allocation of the funds to the vanous types of meetings. It will prevent expenditures in excess of the statutory allowance. 3. Section 2322, C.M C., limits the amount to be ex - pended for purposes of refreshments and the promotion of fratemal intercourse to 30 per cent of the total rev - enue of the Lodge. The section further provides that, in the discretion of the Lodge, the fund may be cumula - tive. Certain decisions define the term “total revenue” and what constitutes expenditures for social purposes 4. The permission to expend 30 per cent for social purposes is not a direction that the maximum amount should be spent. The conservative and careful Lodge will not use the maximum The stated percentage is merely a limitation. N N N H U p m m ‘Pinto and place and circumstances alter all things.

It does, except so far as it is not re - jg i~nant to the peculiar character of the Institution. The wc )rk of Grand Lodge is regulated by the will of the ~ i;~nd Master, from whose dictum, while presiding, thot’o can be no appeal. When installed into office, it is mt as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge, but as the (Klrond tv¶aster of Masons’ (Anderson’s constitutions). A ~1t’ond Master, however, may be tried for abuse of power. Likew[se Ihe work of a Lodge is regulated by the will ot the Master Objections to decisions may be laid be - fore the Grand Master by any five Master Masons in CiOod standing. Who may preside over a Lodge? The Grand Master, the Master (who cannot transfer his duties to a Warden when he is present), and in the absence of the Master, the Warden3in the order of their rahk. The Master or a Warden being present, may invite any qualified brolh - or, or brethien, to confer degrees. BUSII”JESS. No Lodge shall transact any business with a less number than seven members present, ex - cept the conferring of degrees (In Council, Chapter and Commandery, nine constitute a quorum.) No business of any kind except collections or appro - pncxtions for charity, conferring of degrees, ceremonial observances, electing a representative Ia Grand Lodge, balloting for trial commissioners, or (by dis - pensation) to ballot for and confer degrees without ref — [109 ] — — [108] —"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"erence to a committee, or (by dispensation) to receive and act upon the petition of a rejected candidate within twelve months after rejection, shall be done at a special meeting. All business except examination of candidates and conferring degrees shall be done in a Lodge of Master Masons. MCYI’IONS must be put in writing if the Master re - quires it, and must be seconded belore being consid - ered. Strict courtesy shall be observed in debate. The previous question,” being a parliamentary motion in - tended to suppress debate, is “utterly unknown in the parliamentary law of Masonry, and it would be always out of order to move it in a Masonic body” (Mackey). The Mastei may suspend discussion at any time, which prerogative should be exercised with caution and good judgment. Ordinanly, a member should be permitted to speak but once on the same sub]ect, except that the mover of the resolution may close the debate. VOTING. All questions before the Lodge, excepling amendments to the by-laws, balloting upon petitions and applications and upon petitions for reinstatement to membership, and upon applications to the Grand Mas - ter for dispensations, are determined by a majority of the members present. Members present and not voting are presumed to acquiesce with the majority vote. In all cases of a tie vote (except votes by ballot) the Master, in addition to his proper vote, may have the casting vote. The usual method of voting is viva voice or by show of hands, but the Lodge may determine how the vote on any particular matter should be had. Any member not satisfied with the correctness of the result may then call for a division, which should not be refused if made at this time. The Master then puts the question a second time, requesting those on each side to stand alternately while they are counted. The Mas - ter—but usually the Secretary—notes the number vot - ing, and the announcement of the vote thus made is final, from which there is no appeal. The same form should follow when other than a ma - jonty vote is required SUBSDDIARY MOTIONS. During discussion of a main question, the only subsidiary motions that can be en - tertained in a Masonic Lodge are: I. To lie on the table; 2. To postpone indefinitely; [rn By-Laws may be amended only by two-thirds of tho members present~ after notice as required by the Ily”i..aws e All applications to the Grand Master for a dispensa - tion must be by Lodge action. ANNOUNCEMENT OF VOTE. The question having boen put, and it clearly appearing that there is a de - cision, the Master should announce that “the ayes have IV—the motion is adopted”; or “the noes have it—the motion is lost.” A member suspended for nonpayment of dues for more than two years may be restored only by the votes of two-thirds of the members present, at the stated mooting next after tbe petition for restoration is pine - ~onted. Such vote must be by ballot. — [110 I — — 1111] —"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"U 3. To postpone to a day certain, 4. To commit, 5. Toarnend. Consideration oi these motions has precedence in the order as above arranged That is to say, if a motion to amend has been made during the discussion a motion may be made to postpone indefinitely, and if this be adopted, discussion ends Or, if dunrig debate on a proposal to amend, each of the four other questions be presented, then each of these questions must be put in the order of precedence If an amendment be adopted, the question will be upon the original motion as amend - ed. If the amendment be lost, the question will be upon the onginal motion An amendment can only be made to strike out certain words, to add or insert certain words, or to strike out certain words and insert others. An amendment may be made to strike out all after the first word, which if adopted would in effect dispose oi the question Such a motion, however, in a Masonic Lodge is of doubtful propriety A motion to strike out may be amended by motions to add or retain certain words Any number of amend - ments may be proposed to a motion, and be all offered before a vote is taken on any of them; provided that an amendment may not again be proposed in identical form. But they must be put in the order in which they are offered. An amendment to an amendment is admissible. Fur - ther amendments are out of order There are some exceptions, however, to this rule because of the restrictions of the By-Laws and the Con- — 1112 ] — Dr I S V I 2 ~tjtution. For instance, a motion to amend the By-Laws must be in writing and lie over until the next stated moeting for consideration Such motion is subject to timeridment at the meeting at which it is offered, but not at a later meeting. It must be adopted or rejected A two-thirds vote of the members present is necessary to amend the By-Laws A resolution to provide for life membeiship likewise must be in writing, lie over until the next stated meet - ing, and is subject to amendment at the meeting at which it is introduced, but riot later If it is desired to cimend, another resolution must be introduced, and ti’eated in the same manner as the original A majority vote of the members present is necessary to pass such resolution, and notice in wnting must be forwarded to every member before action is had 1 To lie on the tczble. This motion takes precedence over all other motions, must be put immediately and is not debatable. It should rarely be invoked in a Masonic Lodge 2 To postpone indefinitely. This is subject to debate of a limited character, and the merits of the ongirial question should form no part of the discussion 3 To postpone to adoy certain. This maybe termed a friendly motion, that is, one made by the mend of a proposition It may be amended by striking out the time fixed and inserting another The best form is to move that the question be made the special order for a certain day and hour. This motion is seldom used in Lodges, but it is not unusual in Grand Lodge, which meets for several days In Lodge, it is sometimes desirable to — [113 j —"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"postpone to a later hour of the same meeting. Debate on such a motion must not go to the merits of the prop - osition, but only to the expediency of postponement. 4. Te cemmit. The usual form of the motion is thai the proposition be referred to committee—if to a standing committee, the mover should indicate what committee; if to a special committee, it should be so stated and the number of members of the committee designated. A motion to commit may be amended, as for instance, by adding “with instructions to report” at a time fixed. Debate on a motion to commit must not be on the merits of the original proposition, but only on the propriety ol committing it. If the report of the committee be not sat - isfactory, a motion may then be made to recommit, and such motion may be made at any time prior to the adoption of the committee’s report. OF INCIDENTAL QUESTIONS. Cushing defines inci - dental questions to be “those which anse out of and are connected with (though they do not necessarily dispose of) other questions to which they relate, and which, for the time being, they supersede.” It is impossible to anticipate or enumerate all the incidental qustions that may anse in the course of a discussion. Five, however, are of frequent occurrence, as follows: 1. Questions ol order; 2. Questions of reading papers; 3. Questions of leave to withdraw motions; 4. Questions on suspending a rule; 5. Questions on taking the vole by ayes and noes. ‘7 i I m I I Si’ p S p 11 :11 These are always in order, and for a time take prec~~ edence of the main question, provided they refer to that question. Incidental questions are subject to the rule as to subsidiary questions. For instance, it may be moved to lay any one of them on the table, to postpone, or to commit; and when the incidental question is disposed of, discussion on the main question may be resumed. (1) Questions of order: (1) Two independent original propositons cannot be presented at the same time. If a Lodge is discussing a motion, no other independent motion may be entertained, although a subsidiary one may, until the first motion is disposed of. (2) A subsidiary motion cannot be entertained out of its rank of precedence. That is to say, when a motion has been made to lay a proposition on the table, it would be improper to move to postpone, until the mo - tion to lay on the table is disposed of. (3) When a brother desires to speak, he should ad - dress himself to the Master, and never (without express permission) to any other member. (4) If two or more brethren rise nearly at the same time, the Master should indicate who is entitled to the floor. (5) A brother must not be interrupted by any other brother, except for the purpose of calling him to order, or by permission ot the Master, and while he is on the floor no motion can be made or put. (6) No brother, except the mover ot a question (who may have the close of the debate) should speak more than once, but this rule may be dispensed with by the — [114 ] — — [115 1 —"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Master, if he deems it proper to permit it. (7) No abusive or improper language should be per - mitted, and the Master may, and ought to, direct a disorderly brother to be excluded from the meeting if he should persist in his misbehavior. (8) The Master may at any time speak, and a brother on the floor should sit down while the Master is speak - ing, unless his remarks be merely in the nature of a question directed to the brother. (9) Everyone who speaks should speak to the ques - tion. This is the most important of all the rules of order, because it is the one most necessary for bringing de - bate to a satisfactory conclusion. It is sometimes difficult to determine when this rule is violated, but it is within the discretion of the Master to judge and say how far a brother should be indulged in a line of argument not strictly within the scope of the question before the Lodge. (10) Generally, there should be no speaking unless there be a question regularly before the Lodge, but it is permissible to permit a brother who is about to make a motion, to speak in its favor before actually proposing it, but with the understanding that he will speak to the question and will conclude by formally making his mo - tion. But it is always better to first present the motion, secure a second, and then speak to it. The Master should always be on the alert to check any breach of order, but it is always in order for any member to rise to a point of order, which he may do by saying, “I rise to a point of order” The speaker objected to should then desist and the Master should request that the point of order be stated. If the Master decides the point “not well — [ 1161 — S S II taken,” he should direct the speaker to resume his ar - gument If the Master decides the point “well taken,” it prevents the speaker from further discussion, if it is the discossion itself that is objected to, or cautions the speaker, if the objection was made to the manner or scope oi his remarks Of course there can be no appeal irom the decision of the Master on a point of order—or irom any decision of the Master. 2 Of questions for reading papers. Any member has the right to call for the reading of any paper which constitutes the subject matter of a proposition. But if a paper has been once read, or if referring only indirectly to the subject under discussion, then it should not be read except upon motion regularly made and adopted by a majority vote 3 Of questions of leave to withdraw motions. When a motion or resolution has been made and sec - onded, and stated by the Master, it is the property of the Lodge, and van only be withdrawn by consent of the members present, which consent must be unanimous. This rule is contrary to the accepted version of parlia - mentary practice as it prevails in some Lodges, but it is correct, because if the Lodge were to grant leave for the withdrawal of a motion over the objection of any mem - ber, the objecting member might immediately renew the motion A formal motion, however, to withdraw is riot usually deemed necessary If the mover desires to withdraw his motion, he may ask permission to do so (and t is not necessary to secure the consent of the one who sec - onded the motion). If no one objects, the consent is assumed to be granted But if a member says “I ohie’~’-’~’ — 1117 1 —"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"discussion continues on the main question. The mo - tion—or request—for permission to withdraw a motion may be made at any time before final vote is declared. But it an amendment has been proposed to a motion, the original motion cannot be withdrawn until the amendment has been withdrawn or defected, and if an amendment has been adopted, it is not in order to ask to withdraw the original motion Questions for the withdrawal of papers—reports of committees, petitions, or protests—are in the nature of questions for the withdrawal of motions and are subject to the same rule There is one exception to this regu - lation, and that relates to petitions for degrees or for affiliation, which cannot be withdrawn after having been received by the Lodge. 4. Questiens on suspending a rule. There is a recog - nized power in every deliberate body to suspend any of its rules for the purpose ol transacting business which would be riot permissible under the general rule, which suspension may be made at any time by unanimous consent Which motion is not debatable nor subject to amendment, but must be brought to a direct vote But in a Lodge of Masons no By-Laws, no part of the Constitu - tion, can be suspended, and a motion to suspend any By-Law or any part of the Constitution cannot be enter - tamed. A standing resolution, however, as, br in - stance, a resolution relating to the powers and duties of Trustees, may by unanimous vote be suspended. If, however, a resolution provides as to the mode in which it may be amended, that mode only may be followed. Therefore, if a standing resolution provides that it may not be repealed or amended except after notice to all m I S S S Ii I S I EL QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE. In legislative bodies there occur questions which relate to matters affecting the dignity or rights of the assembly of its members, and these are called “questions of privilege.” Questions of this kind take precedence of all other business, and are always in order. Such questions are rarely if ever brought up in a Masonic Lodge, but it might happen in the following instances Any matter relating to the al - leged misconduct of a member, matters affecting the reputation ob the Lodge, such as false reports of its pro - ceedings; matters affecting the secrecy of proceedings, where a member deems it necessary to give proper precautions. The Master must decide whether, in his judgment, the questions is properly one of privilege, and it must be at once considered, but it may be dis - posed of by any mode of disposition to which any other question is subject. ~n) PRIVILEGED QUESTIONS. These should not be con - founded with “questions of privilege” which are priv - members, it may not be suspended or changed eiccept In accordance with its own provisions. 5. Of questions on taking the vote by ayes and flees. In Grand Lodge, three members may demand that a vote on any question shall be taken by written ballot. This is provided by the Constitution At any time before a decision is announced, any member may change his vote. In a Lodge, however, if a motion should be made for a vote on any proposition by ayes and noes, the Master should rule it out of order. There is no necessity for such a proceeding in a Masonic Lodge — 1118 j — — [119 1 —"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"ileged questions, for all privileged questions are not questions of privilege Privilege questions are not per - sonal, they relate to matlers of business. They are of three kinds: (1) Those which relate to the rights and privileges of the Lodge or any member; (2) Motions for reconsideration, (3) Special orders. A motion to reconsider is a privileged question, and can only be entertained at the same meeting during which a matter has been disposed ol If it is desired at a future meeting to undo that which was previously done, the proper motion would be, at such future meeting, not to reconsider, but to repeal or rescind No one who voted on the losing side can move a reconsideration A motion for reconsideration is riot debatable unless the question proposed to be reconsidered was debatable A majority vote is sufficient for reconsideration After reconsideration, the onginal question is placed just as it was when adopted, and not as tirst presented, if it had been amended or changed in any way, and may be amended or postponed, or treated in any mariner de - sired The reconsiderations herein referred to do not apply to the ballot foi degrees or membership Reconsideration of ballot. A ballot upon a petition for degrees or an application for membership cannot be reconsidered.

But unfortunately it does sometimes happen a worthy candidate is rejected because of mistaken idontity or other reasons, and a reconsideration is desir - ttblo and proper. This may only be done by a motion, at tirty stated meeting within twelve months after rejec - lion, to petition the Grand Master for a dispensation to ‘roceive and set upon the petition of _______,a reject - ad applicant,” which motion must be decided by ballot Unanimous vote is necessary to carry the motion The Soeretary should then certify to the Grand Master the fact that the motion was adopted as above required, and in addition should set forth the reasons why the dispensation is desired There can be no discussion re - garding an unfavorable ballot, either upon the petition itself or on a defeated motion to reballot Before a ballot is taken, discussion of the qualifications of the candi - date is permissible The Master, on his own motion, may order a second ballot on a motion to request a dispensation to reballot, to correct a possible mistake, the same as on the petition itself. Special orders.

And any business transacted at a stated meeting of a Lodge of Masons before the hour fixed in the By-Laws is void and of no effect. The Grand Lodge of California has wisely, in the Uniform Code of By-Laws, provided for a regular order of business at stated meetings, as follows: 1. Readings of the minutes, 2 Reports of committees; 3 Balloting; 4. Reception of petitions, 5. Miscellaneous and unfinished business; 6. Confernng of degrees In the proportion as that order is observed will be the harmony and celerity with which business will be transacted Unfinished business should take prece - dence over new business, else it might happen that new business would accumulate to the point oi confu - sian and the unfinished business suffer.
