The Preparation-room is plain, without furniture or orna - ments. The Hall of the WEST, or First Apartment, represents the encampment of the Hebrews, in huts and tente, amid the ruins 9"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"10 FIFTEENTH DEGREE of Jerusalem. The hangings are so arranged that the room may represent a large tent. They are white, blue, scarlet, and purple. When the room is fully lighted, there are seventy lights, in ten groups of seven each, each seven forming a triangle and a square. One in each group of seven is all the time lighted. The others will be lighted at the proper time in the work. The Seats in the East and West are plain, without covering of any sort. In the West is a painted scene, representing the ruins and prostrate and broken columns of the Temple in the foreground, and in the rear thc shattered walls of the city. This scene is arranged to roll up, and when it does so, it discloses in the West the Altar, with the Candelabrum of seven lights near it. On the Altar are the Book of the Law, or roll of the Pentateuch, the Book of Constitutions, a Sword and Trowel, and a pair of Compasses open to sixty degrees; and above the Altar a transparency, being a five-pointed Star, blazing with rays of red and green, and in its centre the letter . Along the sides of the Hall are also paintings, representing the broken walls and gates, and ruined buildings, seen through openings in the hangings. The Hall of the EAST, or Second Apartment, represents the Council-Chamber of C’~iius, King of Persia, at Babylon. It is hung with green, from the ceiling to the floor. On the South, West, and North, there must be a space of five or six feet between the hangings and the wall. The room is brilliantly lighted, by no particular number or arrangement of lights. In the East is a superb Throne. In the West are two arm-chairs; on the North and South, seats for the Knights. The Throne is elevated by two steps, and adorned with gold lace and fringe. Behind the Throne is a transparency representing the dream of Cyrus, to wit, a roaring lion, ready to spring upon him; above it a brilliant glory, surrounded with luminous clouds; and in the centre of the glory the word ‘~r’~ ? fIT.

Inside of the hangings, with room for the Brethren to sit between, should be a wall of canvas, about four feet high, painted to represent brick-work, commencing on each side of the Throne, and going entirely around the North, South, and West sides of the room, inclosing within it the two chairs in the West. At each of the four corners, and also midway each of the Northern, Southern, and Western sides, is a round tower, also painted like brick-work, and, except that midway the Western side, six feet high. This last must be at least eight feet high, and large enough to contain a man. It must have two doors, one opening on the inside, and the other on the outside of the hangings. At the former door, in the space between the hangings and the wall, must be two sentinels armed with pikes and swords. The hangings must fit closely to the sides of this tower, so that one can pass in and out of it, behind them, without being seen by any one in the room; and there must be no passage for the light, from one door of the tower to the other. The wall may extend along the East, behind the Throne: and it may also be higher, and the towers higher and larger, if the hall be spacious enough. When the Brethren stand, they will be inside, and when they sit, outside of the wall. The door leading into the antechamber should be near the East. In the antechamber, or passage between the two apartments, must be a solid wooden bridge. Under it, a representation of a running stream, with bodies and dismembered limbs floating in it. Near it should be a watch-fire. The approach to it must be guarded by several armed Then, and one end of it should be near the door of the First Apartment. The river represents the river Gadara.

After Jerusalem was taken and sacked, its walls broken down, the Holy House of the Temple—.--builded where once was the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite—demolished, and many of the Priests, Nobles, and people put to death, a large part of those who remained were carried by the victors across the river (the Euphrates), into Babylonia and Mesopo - tamia, and there colonized as subjects of the King of the Kasidim or Chald~ans. Most of those who were left at Jerusalem and in Jud~a, soon after fled into Egypt, and remained colonized there until after the overthrow of the Babylonian Empire by the Medians. Among those so expatriated, were many Initiates of the Hebrew and Ph~nician Mysteries, possessed of the means of making themselves known to the Initiates, not only of Egypt and Ghald&ea, but also of Greece, Persia and India. Some of these, men of intelligence and learned in all the learning of the Hebrews at, that day, and in that of the Ph~nicians, and eager to increase their knowledge, and to drink at the springs of Philosophy and the Holy Doctrine, journeyed, as Pytha - goras, Plato, Herodotus and Plutarch did, to the ancient seats of learning and shrines of the Mysteries, communicating with the Hierophants of the Mitzraim, the Magi of Persia, and the Brahmins of India, studied the Holy Books, and received the Higher Degrees, ancient and modern, of Initiation. As the Ph~nician ships visited the ports of Gaul, of Britain, and of Ireland, it is probable that the Hebrew Initiates also communicated with the Druids, and received the degrees of the Northern Mysteries. A People subjugated always dreams of regaining its liberties. An Order proscribed, and no longer daring to avow its exist - ence, will still continue to exist, wearing the masks, as it were, of other Orders, and under other names.

These Orders will, of course, apparently cease to exist; but they will borrow the names and ceremonial and formulas of other Societies, and, thus con- tri cealed, toil at their task in silence. or It was known that the spirit of insubordination or inde - pendence was strong among the Hebrews. Jerusalem was th represented to Artaxerxes as “a rebellious and bad city.” “So re shalt thou find in the Book of the Records,” it was written to H him, “and know, that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful WE unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city an destroyed~” It had often been guilty, it was alleged, of “insur- he rection against kings;” and Haman said of the Hebrews to an Ahasuerus, “their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws; wherefore it is not for the king’s yo profit to suffer them; let it be written that they be destroyed.” Thus the degrees obtained by those of the Hebrews who traveled with the Master’s Worn, into foreign cour&tries, there to obtain Master’s wages, carried by them into the Hebrew colonies, were soon naturalized in Jud~ea itself. The tendency of all Orders is to multiply too greatly the number of their Initiates, until their secrets and purposes are even divulged to the profane, and then to create new and higher degrees, con - ferred at first on a small number of the Elect, in order to confine to them the knowledge of the Secret or Holy Doctrine, and of the real purposes of the Order. It has been especially so in Freemasonry. the Of course, many of the Initiates who were carried as captives to Babylonia, and elsewhere dispersed as colonists or wander - ers, forgot their obligations and ceased to perform the duties, while remembering the Words, Signs, and Tokens, of Masonry. For this and the other reasons mentioned, those of the Hebrews who in foreign countries or at Jerusalem awaited the time when they should be allowed to rebuild the Temple, and who in the meantime communicated at irregular intervals with pa~ each other, invented or adopted new degrees, into which only resi"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE EAST 31 a select few were admitted, and in which were preserved the ancient traditions and memorials of the Craft. These degrees were conferred on none except those known to be good and true Masons (in the Hebrew, ~ AMf~Ni?M, ATchitects or Builders, which also mean Fa.ithftd). The great purpose of all the Hebrew Initiates was to rebuild the Holy House, BITH-YEHUAH, the Haikal Kadosh, and to restore the worship of the True God, in His Temple on the Holy Hill. To this all the idolaters colonized in Samaria were opposed, and by every means in their power hindered the work. You know one symbolical meaning of the Temple. It and its rebuilding have another, which you may perhaps know hereafter. In this degree, Masonry presents itself as the royal and Sacerdotal Art., and the East and the West are in com - munication. You are surrounded by a new symbolism, and you must divine its meaning for yourself. * * * * * * ~ * * * * * * We invest you with the APRON, Ginix~, and Cou~i of the Degree.

The b hostility and threats of the surrounding Colonies and Tribes a compelled those who toiled in rebuilding the Holy House and the walls of the City, to work with it in one hand and in the a. other hold a weapon. So the Sword of Knighthood and the 1K Trowel of Masonry met in the same service, as they were again found united in much later day9. On the ends of the girdle you see a representation of a Bridge, upon the arch of which are the letters L.. ID.. P.., the initials, it is said in the old French Rituals, of the words LIBERT~ DE PASSER, Liberty of Passage. It was thus that our Brethren anciently concealed the meaning of their symbols, and the purposes and intents of their organizations, when those purposes were deemed treasonable by tyrants, and death was the penalty for belonging to a proscribed but still dreaded order. • The bridge spanning the bloody stream is a symbol of the passage of an individual or a people from slavery to freedom, from servitude and subjugation to independence and nationality, from spiritual bondage to spiritual liberty. Neither does this signify an immediate and sudden passage from one state of being to another. YAVERGN HAMIM or H ‘MAIM is rendered, “the passage or crossing of the water8;” but the word that means ford, passage, or cTo8sing is A bar, Aabar or Aavar. The~, (I or Y,) prefixed, causes the noun to convey the idea of a progressive state or condition, or the repetition of an action; and the affix or termination UN or ON, gives the word the additional meaning of moot or Qreat, amplifyinq the meaning, and expressing greater intensity and force of action. Thus the word YAVERON means a great or most momentous and long-continued passage or crossing. The transition from slavery to liberty, or that from political or religious subservi - ence to freedom of Thought and Conscience, is not to be effected instantaneously or even quickly, but only by a great and ‘persistent struggle, in which there are often repulses and reverses, discouragements and apparent defeat. . .

This life and this warfare you have voluntarily accepted; and I do now exhort you to do your duty manfully, as a true Knight should. * * * * * * The weapon of a Knight is the symbol of IHONOR and LOYALTY. He is not to draw it, for either King or People, in an unjust cause, or in resistance to rightful authority. For the columns YAKIN and BOAZ of the HOLY HousE, are AUTHORITY and LIBERTY, in equilibrium; and there is no true Freedom, except in implicit obedience to the just laws and rightful magistrates of the State. . The three concentric triangles of the JEWEL of the Degree, are not only LIBERTY, EQUALITY and FRATERNITY; Liberty, civil, political, and religious; but also LAW, ORDER and SUB - ORDINATION; and the swords are not only to be used against despots who rule and rob by force or craft, but for the Laws and Civil Institutions of the State against the violences of Anarchy and the usurpations of Military ‘Power, and of popular Assemblies that in the name of necessity and the safety of the People take from the people all the safeguards and securities of Constitutional Liberty. * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"34 FIFTEENTH DEGREE HISTORY cr “Now, in the first year of Cyrus, King of Persia,” says the compiler of the Sacred Book of Chronicles, “(that the word in of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished), as the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, King of Persia, that V. he made a proclamation throughout all his Kingdom, and also in writing, saying: Thus sayeth Cyrus, King of Persia: All the kingdoms of the Earth, hath the Lord God of Heaven given me: and he hath charged me to build him an House in Jerusalem in Judea. Who among you are of his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.” The dream which you have heard described in the cere - monies of this degree, and the earnest solicitations of Zerub - babel, a Prince of the House of Judea, and one of those held in captivity in Persia, (who had served in the Persian wars, and on one occasion had saved the life of Cyrus in his youth. and who had recently returned from a pilgrimage to Jeru - salem,) coupled with the interpretation of the dream by the Prophet Daniel, the Chief of the Sarakim or Presidents set by Cyrus over the one hundred and twenty Princes of Persia, who denounced against the King the anger of God, and his own speedy destruction, if he dared to disobey the mandate conveyed to him in his dream, produced this Proclamation— the liberation of the captives and the restoration of the Holy ti Vessels of the Temple. Ten Chiefs or Sagons of the Hebrews accompanied Zerub - babel to Jerusalem; among whom were Jeshua the son of x Josedech, the High-Priest, and Nehemiah, the Scribe. And in all there went from Persia and Assyria, at that time, to in Jerusalem, forty-two thousand, three hundred and sixty sl Hebrews, besides servants and their maids. Zerubbabel, with the Sagons who accompanied him, and a large force of the People, ascending the Euphrates to pass ol round the northern end of Arabia Deserta, and thence journey - ing by the way of Damascus, reached in safety the river Ahava. Over this he threw a bridge; but was attacked in"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE EAST 35 crossing, by a large force of the Babylonian Colonists of Samaria, and a bloody battle ensued, resulting in the defeat of the enemy and the safe passage of the Hebrews, Zerubbabel losing in the battle the decoration which Cyrus had given him, as the badge of his rank and dignity as Satrap of Persia and Viceroy of Judea. After the destruction of the City by Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, his General, left many of the poorer people in the land of Judea, and assigned them vineyards and fields. He also liberated Jeremiah the Prophet, the zealous partisan of the Assyrians against the Egyptians, and gave him per - mission to remain at Jerusalem, furnishing him the means whereby to live. He made Gedaliah the son of Ahaikam, Governor over the cities of Judea, and placed him over the poor people not carried away to Babylon. After the Assyrian forces had marched homeward, the Jewish troops that had been in the field and at posts distant from the City, and all the Jews that had sought refuge from the storm of Assyrian war in Moab, and among the Amunites, and in Edom and elsewhere, returned to Judea, and gathered grapes and summer-fruits on which to live. When Ishmael, of the blood royal, had murdered Gedaliah, after eating bread with him, and had also killed the Assyrian troops that had been left as guards for the Governor, and had then himself fled to the Amunites, Johanan the son of Kareah, succeeded to the command over the people, and removed them near to the frontier of Egypt, fearing the anger of the Assyrian King, whose troops had been treacherously murdered. And soon afterwards, notwithstanding the urgent advice of Jere - miah, who warned them that, if they went into Egypt, they should die by the sword, by famine and by the pestilence, Johanan and the other captains led the whole remnant of the people into that country. There they embraced the worship of the Goddess Neith, and sacrificed to her. But Nebuchad - nezzar invaded Egypt with a great army; and conquered it, and shattered the images, and burned the Temples of the gods, and destroyed most of the expatriated Israelites. A small"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"36 FIFTEENTH DEGREE number escaped, and returning to Judea, settled about Jeru - salem, and there remained, wretched and miserable, and cxposed to constant attacks from relentless enemies on all sides. There, while Ezekiel was seeing visions and prophesying on the banks of the Chaldean river Chebar, and Daniel was being educated at the Court of Babylon, the few fugitives at Jerusalem increased continually, by the arrival of others; but leaving little record of their suffering, their disasters and their successes, struggled to maintain a national existence. Among them were a few Initiates who, recognizing each other, met in secret to practice the ceremonies of Masonry. They explored the ruins until they discovered the entrance to the Secret Vault, entering which they reached the vault, and found the Cubical Stone, and the fragments of the plate, from which the Sacred ‘WORD had been erased. The pedestal still stood in its place. Finding the plate broken up, and no trace of letters upon it, they melted it down, and broke to pieces the cubical stone and pedestal, whose fragments they buried deep in the earth, that no trace of their Mysteries might remain. Thenceforward the WORD was transmitted orally. Still hoping one day to begin their labors upon the Temple, and to rebuild it, they en - deavored to reorganize the body politic of the Nation, by the election by the people of a Governor, with whom as Councilors they ,associated Adonikam, a Priest not wearing the Aurim and Themin, and Hatosh a Scribe, with others initiated by them into the Order of Architects, or of the Faithful. The law and ceremonial prescribed by Moses were lost, except so far as they were preserved by tradition; and the people were governed by these traditions and by such brief statutes as were indispensable to civil order and organization SI for defense. When the captivity ended, Hananiah was the Ruler of this unfortunate and poor people. How he was superseded by Zerubbabel the Tarshatha, and how the rebuilding of the Holy House was authorized to be begun, is recounted in the Book of Ezra."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE EAST 37 When these labors were commenced, the people and work - men, continually harassed by enemies on every side, were compelled to be every moment prepared to defend themselves, and worked at all times with their arms by them; so that they were, by a natural exaggeration, said to labor with the Sword in one hand and the Trowel in the other. After the return from the captivity, in the seventh month, Jeshua the son of Josedech, and his brethren the Priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, rebuilded the Altar of God, and kept the Feast of the Tabernacles, and offered burnt-offerings, of the new moons and regular feasts, from the first day of the seventh month. They hired masons and carpenters; and employed men from Tyre and Sidon, as Solomon had done, to bring cedars from Lebanon to Joppa. In the second year after their return, they laid the founda - tion of the Second Temple; and set the Priests in order, in their vestments, with trumpets, and the Levites with cymbals, to praise the Lord; and sang together, praising and thanking the Lord, for His goodness and His eternal mercy. And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the House of the Lord was laid. And many Priests, and Levites, and Chiefs of the Fathers, who were old men, and had seen the first Temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation laid, and many of them shouted for joy. The prophets had said: “This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts. What art thou, 0 great Mountain?

These troubles, and the ultimate success of the enterprise will be more particularly spoken of in the degree which you are next to receive, some - times improperly said to constitute the second part of one degree of which this is the first part. * * * * * * LECTURE The incidents of this Degree are in part historical. The whole constitutes an allegory. The open lessons which it teaches are fidelity to obligation, and perseverance amid difficulties and reverses. Freemasonry, also, is endeavoring to rebuild the Holy House. The adversaries who trouble the work are many—not only ignorance and intolerance, bigotry and fanaticism, prejudices, and the engrossing daily pursuits of life; but the indifference of the world, and still more, the apathy and lukewarmness of Masons themselves. In the bustle of life and business, and amid the tumult and struggles of politics, the lessons of Masonry are forgotten, and her voice is unheard. Whoso now T"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE EAST 39 engages in any work of reform or beneficence, will soon learn that most men are by nature careless and lukewarm, as to everything that does not concern their own personal and immediate welfare. It is not to the combined efforts of many, but to the energy of a single will, inducing others to follow, that great reforms are owing. What one begins, many unite with him to complete. The enthusiast who imagines that he can inspire with his own zeal the larger portion, or even a few of the members of a community or an order, is speedily dis - appointed, and will in all likelihood weary of his task, and abandon it in disgust. To many, his purposes will seem chimerical and his notions fanciful. Many will, through mere inertia, listen apathetically to his exhortations, and yawn in reply to his urgings. To do and suffer all, and when success is accomplished, notwithstanding all obstacles and hindrances, to see those who looked coldly on, or perhaps opposed him, reap the honor and the reward, is the common lot of those who serve mankind. He who endeavors to serve and to improve the society in which he lives, the State of which he is a citizen, is like a swimmer struggling to ascend a rapid river, lashed into angry waves by the winds. Often they will overwhelm him, often baffle him and bear him back. Most men will yield to the stress of the current, and float with it to the shore. It is the motionless and the stationary that most impede the current of progress—the solid rock or stupid dead tree, planted firmly on the bottom, and around which the river whirls and eddies: th6se who doubt and hesitate, and are dis - couraged, that doubt the possibility of making men wiser and better, that do not think it of any use to toil and deny them - selves and suffer, since nothing good can come of it; that expect others to do all, even when they themselves neither oppose nor ridicule the work; and that predict the failure which they thus do their utmost to cause. Undoubtedly there were many such at the rebuilding of the Temple. There were prophets of evil and predicters of"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"40 FIFTEENTH DEGREE ignominious failure: there were those who looked on and sneered; and those who thought they did enough if they now and then faintly applauded. Ravens croaking ill omen, and the jealous and envious who secretly plotted to hinder, and the censorious who found fault, were as numerous then as now; for human nature was neither better nor worse then than it is today. r If he who toils has it for his purpose to liberate a people t from a tyranny, or to prevent a free people from submitting to usurpations or sinking into anarchy, or to rescue them from d the spiritual bondage that selfish craft has imposed upon them, n he will find more enemies than friends among those whom he V seeks to serve. You will most surely offend him whose preju - dices you assail, whose errors you demonstrate. It is easier to restore lost liberties to a people, easier to rouse them to energetic effort to recover them, than to prevent them from h throwing away rights of which they are weary, or the value of which they do not appreciate. Yet the transition from h bondage to freedom is slow and painful. The way from the borders of Egypt to the Jordan is not long, and yet the Children of Israel wandered to and fro in the desert between, for forty years. The Holy House of the Temple is one great symbol of Free - masonry. As a symbol it has more than one interpretation. It is, as all Masons know, a symbol of the Universe, as also every Lodge is. In this degree it is especially the symbol of Liberty, and of a Free State, built up on the solid foundation of the virtue and intelligence of the people, with the two great columns of Truth and Justice standing as sentinels at its grand gateway of the East.

He was a lineal descendant of Aaron, and well read in the Mosaic law and sacred traditions, and a favorite of the King, who readily"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"PRINCE OF JERUSALEM 75 granted his request to be allowed to return to Jerusalem and unite again with his people; and issued in his favor a decree to that effect; which may be read in the seventh chapter of the Book of Ezra. Collecting together one thousand five hundred and six men, with their women and children, and ashamed to ask an escort of the King, because he had assured him that God would protect and defend them on the way, Ezra set forth from Babylon on the first day of the first month, of the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, prepared to enforce as well as obey the law of God. At the river Ahava (a Zend and Persian name from the Sanskrit, Ahava, “war, battle”), he encamped and remained three days, and there sent for and was joined by two hundred and sixty-two Levites and Nethinim, or persons whose duty it was to serve the Levites. There he held a fast, delivered the sacred vessels into the custody of the Priests, and again moved, on the twelfth day of the first month, safely through the hostile forces that lay in wait for him by the way he passed, protected by God, and reached Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, having occupied four months in the journey; and there delivered the mandates of the King to his Lieutenants and Governors, and they furthered the people and the House of God. In the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month, all the people assembled at Jerusalem, in obedience to his per - I emptory summons, commanding their attendance on pain of exile and confiscation of goods; and there they sat in the streets, in a great rain, trembling with fear and shivering with cold. Then he commenced the work of reform by compelling all who had married among the unbelieving people of the country to put away their wives. After Nehemiah was appointed Governor, and the walls of the city were completely rebuilt, and on the first day of the seventh month, a solemn feast was held, and the whole people came together. Then Ezra brought forth the book of the I"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"7Q SLXTEENTH DEGREE Law of iPvloses, and read it to the people, and with the aid of the Priests and Levites expounded it to them for seven days, during which time they rejoiced and feasted, as they had not done since the time of Jeshua the son of Nun; and on the eighth day a solemn assembly was held according to the ancient custom, at which many were initiated into the mysteries. And on the twenty-fourth day there was a fast; and the people entered into a solemn covenant, by which they bound themselves, confirming it by an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and keep all God’s Commandments, and His Judgments and IHis Statutes, and to pay tax and tithes and the first fruits, and observe the seventh day and the seventh year. Thus was the Temple rebuilt, the work of our Ancient Brcthren completed, and the old law restored. The colonists from beyond the river Euphrates, settled in Samaria and other parts of Palestine, with the remnants of the original tribes of Pagans, compelled by the power of the Kings of Persia to submit and pay tribute to the Beni Israel, no longer disturbed them. The cities were rebuilt, and for a time peace and prosperity reigned in Jerusalem. Alexander marched against it, it is said, in the year 332 B. C., until which time the people had lived in peace. He, it is said, on seeing the High-Priest clad in his sacerdotal robes, declared that he had seen such a figure in a dream, in Macedonia, inviting him to Asia, and promising to deliver the Persian Empire into his hands. Where - fore he went to the Temple, and offered sacrifices to the God of Israel. In the year 320 before Christ, the city was taken by Ptolemy Soter; and in the year 170 by Antiochus, who slew forty thousand of the inhabitants. In the year 166, the government of the Maccabees began; in 107 Judas Hyrcanus assumed the title of King of the Jews, and in 63 the city was taken by the Roman legions under Pompeius.

Pontius Pilate was made Procurator of Judea, A. D. 26; and in the year 70, Titus took the city and sacked it, and burned the Temple. Hadrian rebuilt the city in the year 130; and in the years 135 and 136, the people rebelling against Rome, more than five hundred and eighty thousand of them were slain, and the remainder banished from Judea by an edict of the Emperor, and for - bidden to return or even to look back, on pain of death. Since then they have been dispersed among all other nations. So much, History tells us. The rest is legend and tradition. A few Initiates survived the ruin of the city and the destruction of the Temple, and preserved in the strictest secrecy the ancient mysteries and instruction, adopting such precautions, and admitting none except after tests so thorough, and a probation so long, that the existence of any secret Order among them was wholly unknown. Phcenicia was also conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, 572 years before Christ; by Cyrus 537 years B.C.; by Alexander, 334 B.C.; and by the Romans, 47 B.C.; and partook of the fortunes of Palestine. The Phcenician Initiates, also, dispersed in different countries, and having at an early day planted colonies in Ireland, practiced the same mysteries as the Hebrews, and furnished architects, it is said, to the different nations of Europe. The Hebrews cherished the fond idea, founded upon the promises of their prophets, that a MESSIAH, or annointed and consecrated king would arise, who would reconquer the Holy Land, rebuild the Temple, and at last make his people the Masters of the world. In whatever land they dwelt, Jerusalem was still to them the Holy City, and under the successive Masters of it, the Hebrew pilgrims continually resorted thither, to worship the God of their fathers. When the people were finally banished and dispersed, many of them fled to the desert for safety, and there gathered into bands, protecting themselves by arms. Others returned to the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"78 SIXTEENTH DEGREE Holy City, and on or near the site of the old Temple builded a hospital for those of their people who came to visit Jerusalem. These were a religious order or association, probably Essenes and Initiates, bound by vows of strict observance, pledged to celibacy, and devoted to the relief of the poor. When Peter the Hermit preached the first Crusade, the Hebrews were willing to see the Christian Knights conquer Palestine from the Infidels, hoping that it might thus ulti - mately be restored to themselves. Some furnished moneys to the Princes, and others skilled in the use of arms, and chiefly from the desert of the Thebaid, joined the Crusaders as auxili - aries, and did good service in the field. So also did some of those who had founded the hospital. The first Crusade was published in 1094. An army of 300,000 men was raised, of all nations and tongues, the command of which was. given to Godfrey de Bouillon. On the 15th of July, 1099, Jerusalem was taken by assault, and Godfrey de Bouillon became King. Some merchants of Malfi, trading to the Levant, had, in 1048, obtained leave of the Caliph of Egypt to build a house for such Christians as came on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and received them with zeal and charity. They afterward founded a hospital for the recep - tion of pilgrims, and were thence called Hospitallers, from the Latin word hospes, a guest. Soon after the Christians took the city, they became a Military Order, and this Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, was confirmed by the Pope in 1113. In 1118 the Order of the Temple was established. Upon the taking of the city, many Hebrews resorted to it, from the different countries unto which they had been dis - persed, among whom were many familiar with the learning of the Arabians, the Persians and the Hindus. Many of these were Initiates, disciples of the Magi and Brahmins, and in possession of the high Mithraic and other degrees. Among these were eminent mathematicians and chemists, astronomers, and professors of medical science. Above all, they were"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"PRINCE OF JERUSALEM 79 familiar with the profound and mystic doctrines of the Kabala and Hermeticism, and those of Manes and the other Gnostics. Many of the Hebrews had embraced Christianity, and many more pretended to have done so, out of their indifference to religious disputes and differences, or through policy. Of these some joined the Order of Hospitallers, and some that of the Temple. The more intellectual persons of the latter order eagerly studied the Oriental and Kabalistic philosophy and learning, became Initiates, and acknowledged the bond of brotherhood and a common religion. Some ascended to the higher degrees, to do which they had to throw off the fetters imposed by the Church of Rome on the consciences of the Faithful; and adopted what that church condemned as Gnostic heresies. Wherever in the armies or orders and among the learned and scientific the Initiates were dispersed, they were soon organized into a regular Order and Hierarchy, whose existence was unknown to the Profane, as the very existence of the higher degrees was unknown, except to those possessing them. The Chiefs of the Order, who were not known to those under them, were styled “Princes of Jerusalem,” by which word “Jerusalem,” City of Safety, Salvation or Peace, the Order itself was indicated. It is not known at what time the members of this Fraternity assumed the name of “Freemasons.” In 1187, after the Second Crusade, preached by Saint Bernard in 1146, and headed by the Emperor Conrad II., and Louis VII. of France, Jerusalem was retaken by the Mohar~imedan armies, and the Brethren were again dispersed. Many of them belonged to the Order of the Temple, and fought to recover possession of Jerusalem, in all the succeeding crusades, until, in 1291, the Soldan took Acre, and the Christians were driven out of Syria. In 1312, the Order of the Temple was suppressed; many of the members of it were put to death, and the survivors became merged in other orders, or remained isolated, in order to be safe from persecution. After that, the rebuilding of the Temple I"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"80 SIXTEENTH DEGREE became a symbol of the hoped-for restoration of the Order. The Master Hiram became a symbol of the Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, of Burgundy, who was burned in 1314; and Masonry became the mask of Templarism, its symbols con - cealing the nature and purposes of that Order, and its Kabal - istic and Hermetic dogma, that had brought upon it the con - demnation of Rome. It was dangerous to avow either; and this led to the adoption of the name of Freemasons, and of working-tools of Masons as symbols of these doctrines and purposes. For more than three centuries, the number of the Initiates diminished, instead of increasing; the knowledge of whatsoever was required to be kept secret being confined to a select few, who were known as the faithful guardians of the Sacred Treasure. When a Christian Throne had been established, it is said, in Jerusalem, and Christian Lords held Dukedoms and Princi - palities in Palestine, eighty-one Brethren of the Light, from the Holy City, repaired to Sweden with letters to the Bishop of Upsal, whom they initiated into their mysteries, to secure his assistance in reanimating the zeal of the confederate Princes. When Acre had been taken, it is said, and Syria was lost, at the end of the eighth Crusade (the second of Saint Louis of France), those afterward called Freemasons, or perhaps, at first, Fr~res-Ma~ons, sent again eighty-one of their number to Upsal, to deliver to the Prelate their manuscripts and jewels and other Masonic treasures, sealed up in a coffer. He received it, and deposited it in a marble tomb, sealed with five seals, buried in a deep cavern under the Tower of the Four Crowns. from which, at a later period, those archives were recovered. Upon their return, the Brethren, having lost all hope of re - building the Temple, resolved to abandon Palestine, and form new establishments in remote regions. * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"PRINCE OF JERUSALEM 81 LECTURE We no longer expect to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The Holy House of the Templq is to us only a symbol. To us, the whole universe is God’s Temple, and so also is every upright heart. To establish all over the world the reign of Peace, Loving-kindness, and Toleration, is to build that Temple, most acceptable to God, in which Masonry is now engaged. To make the States and Nations also Temples of God, by establishing in them free government, and the prin - ciples of true liberty, of equality, and of fraternity, is also the work in which Masonry is especially interested. In religion, Masonry needs no temple for its worship. It does not need to make its pilgrimages to Jerusalem, to find its altars. Men may make the woods and mountains their churches and temples, and worship God by a devout gratitude, and by works of charity and beneficence to their fellows. Wherever the humble and contrite heart silently offers up its adoration, under the over-arching trees, in the open level meadows, on the hill-side, in the glen, or in the city’s swarming streets, there are the Holy House of the Temple and the New Jerusalem. The Princes of Jerusalem are no longer the Chiefs of Masonry, nor do they now sit as magistrates, to judge between Masons. But their old duties remain the same, and their symbols have not lost their significance. They are still con - secrated to Justice and Equity, which are the strength and permanence of the State and of the Divine government of the universe. The peculiar duties of this Degree are to reconcile disputes and heal dissensions, and so restore amity and peace; to remove dislikes and soften prejudices, and to inculcate charitable judgment and forgiveness of injuries. They know that the peace-makers are blessed; and they still obey the spirit of the old law, as it was declared to our ancient Brethren, when the Temple was rebuilt, and the Book of the Law once more opened."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"82 SIXTEENTH DEGREE “Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother. Oppress not the widow nor the fatherless, the strangcr nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in his heart. Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor; execute the judgment of Truth and Peace in your gates; and love no false oath; for all these I hate, saith the Lord. “Let those who have power rule in righteousness, and Princes in judgment. And let him that is a judge be as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place; as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. Then the vile person shall no more be called liberal, nor the churl bountiful; and the work of justice shall be peace; and the effect of justice, quiet and security; and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of the times. Walk ye righteously and speak uprightly; despise the gains of oppression, shake from your hands the contami - nation of bribes; stop not your ears against the cries of the oppressed, nor shut your eyes that you may not see the crimes of the great; and you shall dwell on high, and your place of defence be like mountains of rocks.” Forget not these precepts of the old Law; and especially do not forget, as you advance, that every Mason, however humble, is your Brother, and the laboring man your equal. Remember that all Masonry is work; and that the Trowel is one of the symbols of this Degree. Labor is both noble and ennobling, and intended to develop man’s moral and spiritual nature, and not to be deemed disgraceful or a hardship. * * * A life of labor is not a state of inferiority or degradation.

He has ordained that WORK shall be done, in all the dwellings of life, in every productive field, in every busy city, and on every wave of every sea. This He has done, because it hath pleased Him to give man a nature destined to higher ends than indolent repose and irresponsible profitless indul - gence; and because, for developing the energies of such a nature, work was the necessary and proper element. He could not develop these energies without the instrumentality of work. * * * * * * The scene of our daily life is all spiritual. The very imple - ments of our toil, the fabrics we weave, the merchandise we barter, are designed for spiritual ends. Our daily lot may be to us a sphere for the noblest improvement. What we do in our intervals of relaxation, our church-going and our book- reading, are especially designed to prepare our minds for the ACTION of Life. We are to hear and read and meditate, that we may ACT well; and the action of Life is itself the great field for spiritual improvement. There is no task of industry or business, in field or forest, in the mine or factory, on the ship’s deck or the exchange, that has not spiritual ends and discipline for the soul. There is no care or cross of our daily life and labor, that has not been specially ordained to nurture in us and train us unto patience, calmness, resolution, perseverance, gentleness, disinterestedness, and magnanimity. Nor is there any tool or implement of toil, that is not a part of the great spiritual instrumentality. All the relations of life are moral and spiritual; even those which business creates, as of principal and agent, lawyer and client, employer and employed, or master and slave. These cannot subsist an hour, any more than those of relationship • and frien~Mhip and love, without disciplining the soul, and trying its truth, fidelity, forbearance, and disinterestedness. I"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"84 SIXTEENTH DEGREE Every blow that toil strikes has a purpose, good or bad: every action has a motive, in some degree spiritual. All that we have and enjoy, ministering to our necessities, comfort, or luxury, or gratifying our pride, vanity, or ambition, awakens in us emotions of gladness or gratitude, of pride or joy, or selfishness or longing; projects of self-indulgence, or remem - brances of the sorrowing and destitute. Everything acts upon us and influences our conduct and our fortunes. God’s great law of harmony and sympathy is potent and inflexible as His law of gravitation. The noises made by an animal or an insect exasperate or fret us; a sentence that utters a noble thought stirs our blood; and each influences our actions. All the material and visible things around us are the symbols of things greater and higher: all are but the clothing of the Spirit, the utterances of the Divine Thought, the Sacred Writing of the Deity. In this vesture of time is wrapped the immortal Nature; in this show of circumstance and form the spiritual reality is revealed. The visible is the measure of the invisible. The great problem of Humanity is wrought out in the humblest abodes; no more than this is done in the highest. A human heart throbs beneath the beggar’s gaberdine; and that and no more stirs with its beating the prince’s mantle. The beauty of Love, the charm of Friendship, the sacredness of Sorrow, the heroism of Patience, the noble Self-sacrifice, the courage of Truth, these and their like, alone, make life to be worth continuance, and are its glory and power. They are the priceless treasures and jewels of humanity, and they are not the creatures of condition. The million occasions will come to us all, in the ordinary paths of our life, in our homes and by our firesides, in our shops and offices, wherein we may act as nobly as if, all our life long, we visited beds of sickness and pain, and served as Knights of the Hospital or Temple.

They cannot be written on his tomb; but they will be written deep in the hearts of men, of friends, of children, of kindred all around him, in the Book of the great account, and, in their eternal influences, on the great pages of the universe. * * * * * * Let not your own sorrows and troubles lead you into selfish ways: They who, bearing heavy burdens over life’s most hilly road, Strive to cheer a weaker brother bowed beneath another load; Who, with young ones round about them, where full plenty never smiled, Yet can stretch their heart and table, to let in an orphan child. They who, half-fed, feed the breadless, in the travail of distress, They who, taking from a little, give to those who have still less; They who, needy, yet can pity when they look on greater need, These, in Salem’s Holy City, Knights and Princes are indeed. Above all, remember this passionate exclamation of Lessing, the great and good German. “The worth of man does not consist in the truth which man possesses, or bclieves himself to possess, but in the sincere labor he has exercised to attain the truth. For it is not by the possession of truth, but in the search for it, that his energies are widened, wherein consists his ever growing perfectibility. Possession causes ease, idleness, pride.

A vast crowd of indistinct abstractions, hovering in the imagination, a whirl of words embodying no tangible meaning, an inextricable labyrinth of subtleties, was the net result. But one grand idea ever emerged and stood prominent and unchangeable over the weltering chaos of confusion. -God is great, and good, and wise. Evil and pain and sorrow are temporary, and for wise and beneficent purposes. They must be consistent with God’s goodness, purity, and infinite per - fection; and there must be a mode of explaining them, if we could but find it out; as, in all ways, we will endeavor to do. Ultimately, Good will prevail, and Evil be overthrown. God alone can do this, anct He will do it, by an Emanation from Himself, assuming the human form and redeeming the world. Behold the object, the end, the result, of the great specula - tions and logomachies of antiquity: the ultimate annihilation of evil, and restoration of man to his first estate, by a Redeemer, a Christos, the incarnate Word, Reason, or. Power of Deity. This Redeemer is the Word or Logos, the Vohu-mano of Zarathustra, the Ensoph of the Kabalah, the Nous of Platon - ism and Philonism; He that was in the beginning with God, and was God, and by whom everything was made. That He was looked for by all the people of the East is abundantly shown by the Gospel of John. and the letters of Paul; wherein scarcely anything seemed necessary to be said in proof that such a Redeemer was to come; but all the energies of the writers are devoted to showing that Jesus was that Christos whom all the nations were expecting."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"118 SEvENTEENTH DEGREE In this degree the great contest between good and evil, in anticipation of the appearance and advent of the Word or Redeemer, is symbolized; and the mysterious esoteric teachings of the Essenes and the Kabalists. Of the practices of the former, we gain but glimpses in the ancient writers; but we know that, as their doctrines were taught by John the Baptist, they greatly resembled those of greater purity and more perfect, taught by Jesus; and that not only Palestine was full or John’s disciples, so that the Priests and Pharisees did not dare to deny John’s inspiration; but his doctrine had extended V into Asia Minor, and had made converts in luxurious Ephesus, a as it also had in Alexandria in Egypt; and that they readily embraced the Christian faith, of which they had before not k even heard. u These old controversies have died away, and the old faiths have faded into oblivion. But Masonry still survives, vigorous and strong, as when philosophy was taught in the schools of Alexandria and under the Portico; teaching the same old truths d as the Essenes taught by the shores of the Red Sea, and as John the Baptist preached in the Desert: truths imperishable 0 as the Deity, and undeniable as Light. Those truths were gathered by the Essenes from the doctrines of the Orient and the Occident, from the Zend-Avesta and the Vedas, from Plato and Pythagoras, from India, Persia, Phcenicia, and Syria, from Greece and Egypt, and from the Holy Books of the Jews. & Hence we are called Knights of the East and West, because their doctrines came from both. And these doctrines, the wheat sifted from the chaff, the Truth separated from Error, Masonry has garnered up in her heart of hearts, and through the fires of persecution, and the storms of calamity, has brought them and delivered them unto us. That God is One, immutable, unchangeable, infinitely just and good; that Light will finally overcome Darkness, Good conquer Evil, and Truth be victor over Error ;—these, rejecting all the wild and useless speculations of the Brahmans, the Kabalah, the Gnostics, and the Schools, are the religion and philosophy of Masonry."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF TEE EAST AND WE5T 119 Those speculations and fancies it is useful to study; that knowing in what worthless and unfruitful investigatipns the mind may engage, you may the more value and appreciate the plain, simple, sublime, universally acknowledged truths, which have in all ages been the Light by which Masons have been guided on their way, the Wisdom and Strength that like im - perishable columns have sustained and will continue to sustain its glorious and magnificent Temple. It is very surprising that the Essenes, whose exemplary virtues elicited the unbounded admiration of even the Greeks and Romans, and whose doctrines and practices contributed so materially to the spread of Christianity, should be so little known among intelligent Christians. The current information upon this remarkable sect or order of Judaism, to be found in ecclesiastical histories and cyclop~dias, is derived from the short notices of Philo, Pliny, Josephus, Solinus, Porphyry, Eusebius, and Epiphanius. Not only is this combined testi - mony insufficient, but it is too much tainted with the peculiar dogmas of the respective witnesses, to furnish the general reader with an unbiased notion of the character and doctrines e of this ancient sect.

The cardinal doctrines and practices of this sect are as follows: They regarded the Inspired Law of God with the it utmost veneration. The highest aim of their life was to become the temples of the Holy Ghost, when they could prophesy, perform miraculous cures, and, like Elias, be the forerunners of the Messiah.

To this end they abstained from oaths; their communication was ‘yea, yea’; ‘nay, nay; whatsoever was more than these came of evil. The desire to secure themselves from all impure contact with persons not equally scrupulous with themselves ultimately compelled the Essenes to withdraw themselves altogether from the society of their Jewish brethren, to form a separate community, and to live apart from the world. This fear of impurity, joined with the wish to escape all hindrance to spiritual communion with God, also made the Essenes abstain from marriage, although some weak brethren, who could not be like the angels in heaven, neither marrying nor being given in marriage, were allowed to take wives. But these could never advance to the highest orders of the Brother - hood. In their separate community, whatever any one of them possessed was deposited in the general treasury, from which the wants of the whole community alike were supplied by stewards appointed by the whole Brotherhood; so that they had all things in common. There were no distinctions among them, such as rich and poor, masters and servants; they called no one ‘master’ upon earth, but all ministered to the wants of one another. They lived peaceably with all men, reprobated slavery and war, were governed by an elective president-judge, had trials conducted by juries of at least one hundred members, who must be unanimous in their verdict, and the brother who was found guilty of walking disorderly was excommunicated, yet was he not regarded as an enemy, but was admonished as a brother, and received back again after due repentance.

Labor followed until eleven o’clock, when all of them again assembled togethcr, had a baptism in cold water, put on their white garments, the symbol of purity, and then made their way to the refectory, which they entered with as much solemnity as if it were the Temple. The meal was a common one, and each member took his seat according to the order of age. . . . The repast commenced after the Priest had invoked God’s blessing upon it. A mysterious silence was observed during the meal, which had the character of a sacrament, and may have been designed as a substitute for the sacrifices which they refused to offer in the Temple. The Priest concluded it by offering thanks to the Bountifui Supplier of all our wants. Then all laid aside their white garments for their work-dress, and resumed labor until evening, when they again assembled for a common meal. Everything was done under the direction of the Overseers, yet in two things they were at perfect liberty to act as they pleased, viz., they could relieve the distressed with as much money as they thought proper, and manifest their compassion for those who were not of the Brotherhood as much as they liked, and whenever they liked.

Celibacy being the rule of Essenism, the ranks of the Brotherhood had to be filled up by recruits from the Jewish community at large. They preferred taking children, whom they educated most carefully, and taught the practices of the Order, believing that of such the Kingdom of Heaven is best made up. Before a grown-up candidate for membership in the Order could be finally admitted into close fellowship, he had to bind himself by a most solemn oath (this being the"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"122 SEVENTEENTH DEGREE only occasion on which the Essenes used an oath) to observe three things.

Eight different stages marked the gradual growth in holi - ness: (1) the state of outward or bodily purity by baptisms; (2) the stage which imposed celibacy; (3) that of inward or spiritual purity; (4) that which required the banishing of all anger and malice, and the cultivation of a meek and lowly spirit; (5) the culminating point of holiness, upon the summit of which he became (6) the temple of the Holy Spirit, and could prophesy, and whence he advanced to (7) that stage in which he was enabled to perform miraculous cures and raise the dead, after which he reached (8) the position of Elias, the forerunner of the Messiah.

No wonder that. Jews of different sects, Greeks and Romans, Christian church-historians, and heathen writers have been alike con - strained to lavish the most unqualified praise on this holy Brotherhood. Jesus himself showed what is required for a holy life in the Sermon on the mount, by a description of the Essenes. So remarkably does this Brotherhood exemplify the lessons which Christ propounds in Matthew, chap. v., etc. The Essenes were not related to Pythagoras, although Josephus and Philo assumed that they were, and Zeller, in his History of Philosophy, has made a very able summary of supposed resemblances between Neo-Pythagorism and Essen - ism. For, in fact, the parallels between Pythagorism and Essenism are more imaginary than real, and the few things which might be considered as being analogous are unimportant, and are such as will naturally develop themselves among any number of enlightened men who devote themselves almost ex - clusively to a contemplative religious life. Several important peculiarities of the Essenes may. be mentioned in which the Pythagoreans were quite unlike them: Thus, the Essenes were real monotheistic Jews, worshipers of the Holy One of Israel; they did not consider a leader or founder as the centre of their faith, but regarded the inspired Scriptures as their sole source of spiritual life, and called no man master on earth; they made celibacy the rule, marriage the exception; they knew nothing of metempsychosis; they forbade scientific studies as injurious to a devotional life, avoided investigation of the origin and constitution of the universe as inconsistent with piously looking to God as the Creator of all things, and devoutly accepted fate"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"124 SEVENTEENTH DEGREE as heavenly Providence; they were most exemplary in their charity toward all men, and in their unbounded kindness to E those who were not of the Brotherhood; and instead of being 01 aristocratic and exclusive, they were meek and lowly in spirit, f and were so much beloved by those who belonged to different sects, that Pharisees and Sadducees, Greeks and Romans, Jews and Gentiles, joined in lavishing the highest praise upon them. As to the relationship which Essenism bears to Judaism, the facts that the lEssenes, like the other Jews, professed to be T guided by the teachings of the Bible, that a rupture between them and the Jewish community at large is nowhere mentioned, and that on the contrary they are always spoken of in the highest terms of commendation, would of themselves be suffi - cient to prove it. In doctrine, as well as in practice, the ei Essenes and the Pharisees were nearly alike. Besides many other points of exact likeness, both looked upon their meal ni as a sacrament; amongst both, the priest began and concluded E the meal with prayer; both were very strict observers of the 5J Sabbath, and both abstained from using oaths, though it is ~1 true that the Essenes alone uniformly observed it as a sacred principle. The differences between Essenes and Pharisees E were the simple result of the greater rigor of Levitical purity aimed at by the former. The Essenes could avoid impure con - tacts only by isolating themselves in a separate Brotherhood, and by adopting the rule of celibacy, as they did, although their less rigorous brethren of the Pharisaic order regarded h marriage as a most sacred institution, and laid it down as a rule that every man is to take a wife at the age of eighteen. Hence the declaration in the A both of Rabbi Nathan,—’there are eight kinds of Pharisees, . . . and those Pharisees who live in celibacy are Essenes.’ So, also, the Essenes could not E frequent the Temple to offer sacrifices, because of their anxiety to avoid defilement by contact with persons and things not Levitically pure.

The Essenes required those who wished to juin them to sell all their possessions, and to divide the price among e the poor brethren: so Christ (Matt. xix. 21; Luke xii. 33). The Essenes had all things in common, and appointed one of 1 the brethren as steward to manage the common fund: so the primitive Christians (Act ii. 44, 46; iv. 32-34; John xii. 6; xiii. 29). Essenism put all its members on the same level, forbidding the exercise of authority of one over the other, and e enjoining mutual service: so Christ (Matt. xx. 25-28; Mark ix. 3.5-37; x. 42-46). Essenism commanded its disciples to call no man Master upon the earth: so Christ (Matt. xxiii. 8-10). Essenism laid the greatest stress on being meek and lowly in spirit: so Christ (Matt. v. 5; xi. 29). Christ commended the poor in spirit, those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, the merciful, the pure id heart, and the peacemakers; so the Essenes . . .

Their residence at Jerusalem is also evident from the fact that there was a gate named after them. When they ultimately withdrew themselves from the rest of the Jewish nation, the majority of them settled on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea, suffi - f ciently distant to escape its noxious exhalations, and the rest a lived in scattered communities throughout Palestine and Syria.

As to the meaning of the name Essenes, not less than twenty explanations of it have been given. Perhaps that is most probable which derives the term from a Hebrew word which be means pious, as this plainly connects the Essenes with an al ancient Jewish brotherhood, called Khasidim, the pious, who preceded the Essenes, and from whom the latter took their rise.

Yet they regard themselves as the richest of mankind, because they hold that the supply of our wants, and contentment of mind, are riches, as in truth they are. No maker of things belonging to war is found among them. They repudiate every inducement to covetousness. There is not a single slave to be found among them, for all are free, and mutually serve each other. They condemn owners of slaves, not only as unjust, inasmuch as they corrupt t.he principle of equality, but also as impious, because they destroy the law of nature, which, like a mother, brought forth and nourished all alike, and made them all legitimate brethren, not only in word but in deed. “They omit the logical part of philosophy, and the natural part, excepting that which treats upon the existence of God and the origin of the universe; but the ethical part they thoroughly work out for themselves, using as their guides the laws which their fathers inherited. They are instructed in piety, holiness, righteousness, economy, politics, in knowledge of what is .truly good, bad and indifferent, to choose things that are necessary, and to avoid the contrary. They use therein a three-fold rule and definition, viz.: love of God, love of virtue, and love of mankind. Of their love of God they give innumerable demonstrations—e. g., their constant and unalterable holiness throughout the whole of their life; their avoidance of oaths and falsehoods: and their firm belief that God is the source of all good, but of nothing evil. Of their love of virtue they give proofs in their contempt for money, fame, and pleasures, their continence and endurance, in satisfying their wants easily, simplicity, cheerfulness of temper, modesty, order, firmness, and everything of the kind.

They all dwell together in the same place, form themselves into e companies, societies, combinations, and unions, and work together all their life, for the common good of the Brotherhood.

Such is the enviable system of life of the Essenes.” Josephus, who was born about 37 A. D., and at one time actually belonged to the Essenian Brotherhood, gives more than one account of the Order, in the course of his works. The following sentences are from his ‘Jewish War’: “Jews by birth, they love each other more than the others. They reject pleasure as an evil, and regard continence and not yielding to passions as virtues. They despise marriage, and adopt the children of others while still tender and susceptible of instruc - tion, and regard them as their own relations, and train them in their practices. They despise riches, have all things in common in a very admirable manner, and there is not one to be found among them who is richer than another; for it is a law that those who enter the sect must give up their possessions to the society as common property, so that there is not to be seen among them all, either the abjectness of poverty or the distinction of riches; but as every man’s goods are cast into a common treasury, they all, like brothers, have one patrimony. If any of the society come from other places, whatever they have lies open for them, just as if it were their own; and they go to those whom they have never seen before, as if theyhad been most intimate. Hence they take nothing with them when they go on a journey, but arms for defence against robbers. A steward is appointed in every city of this Order to provide strangers with clothes and other necessaries. The keeping and appearance of their body are such as of children brought up in fear; they change neither garments nor shoes till they are worn out or made unfit, by time. They neither sell nor buy any thing among themselves, but every one gives of that which he has to him that wants, and gets from him that which he needs; and even without requital they can freely take whatever they want."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE EAST AND WEST 131 Their piety toward God is extraordinary, for they never speak about worldly matters before the sun rises, but offer up, with their faces toward it, some of the prayers transmitted by their forefathers, as if they supplicated it to rise. Hereupon, they are all sent by the overseers, every one to work in the department in which he i~ skilled; and having diligently labored till the fifth hour, assemble again together in one place, girt round with their linen apron, and have a baptism with cold water. After this lustration they resort to a special house, in which no one of another faith is admitted, and go to the refectory, purified, as into a holy temple. Having quietly taken their seats, the baker gives every one a loaf of bread according to order, and the cook places before each one a dish with one sort of food. The priest commences with prayer, and no one is allowed to taste his food before grace is said. He also returns thanks after the meal; for both at the commence- ment and at the conclusion they praise God as the giver of their food. Whereupon they put off their white garments as if they were sacred, and betake themselves again to their work till evening. On returning again they take their supper together, at which strangers who happen to be in the place, are allowed to sit down with them. No noise or tumult ever desecrates their house, but they let every one take part in the conversation in turn; and the silence of those who are within appears to those that are without as some awful mystery. Whilst they do nothing without the injunctions of their over - seers, yet there are two things in which they have free action, viz., helping the needy and showing mercy; to help the deserv-. ing when they are in want, and to give food to the hungry, they are at perfect liberty. They are just dispensers of their anger, curbers of their passions, representatives of fidelity, ministers of peace; and every word with them is of more force than an oath.

If he has given proof of continence during this time, he approaches nearer to their life and partakes of the holier water of purification; but is still not as yet admitted to their common table. Having thus given proof of his perseverance, his conduct is tested two more years, and, if found worthy, he is admitted into the society.. But before he touches the common meal, he swears, by most awful oaths, first to fear God, and next to exercise justice toward all men—neither to wrong any one of his own accord nor by the command of others; always to detest the wicked and side with the righteous; ever to keep faith inviolable with all men, especially with those in authority, for no one comes to office without the will of God; not to be proud of his power nor to outshine his sub - ordinates, either in his garments or greater finery, if he himself should attain to office; always to love truth and strive to reclaim all liars; to keep his hands clear from stealing, and his mind from unholy gain; not to conceal anything from the Brotherhood, nor disclose anything belonging to them to those without, though it were at the hazard of his life. “Such as are caught in heinous sins are excommunicated from the society, and the excommunicated frequently die a miserable death.

Of the firmness of their minds in all cases, the war with the Romans has given ample proof; in which, though they were tortured, racked, burned, l)rCSSed, and subjected to all the instruments of torment, that they might be forced to blaspheme the law - giver or eat what was forbidden, yet they could not be made to do either of them; nor would they even once flatter their tormentors or shed a tear, but, smiling through their torments and mocking their tormentors, they cheerfully yielded up their souls, as those who would soon receive them back again. For they firmly believe that the bodies perish and their substance is not enduring, but that the souls are immortal, and that when freed from the bonds of the body, they, as if released from a long servitude, rejoice and mount upward. “There are also some among them who undertake to foretell future events, having been brought up from their youth in the study of sacred Scriptures, in divers purifications, and in the sayings of the prophets; and it is very seldom that they fail in their predictions.” Josephus also relates instances in which Essenes foretold future events. The last account given by him of this Order is in his Antiq., book xviii., chap. i., § 2 and 5. He says in § 5—”The doctrines of the Essenes delight in leaving all to God. They regard the soul as immortal, and say that the attainment to virtue must be fought for with all our might. Although they send consecrated gifts to the Temple, yet they never bring any sacrifice, on account of the different rules of purity which they observe; hence, being excluded from the common sanctuary, they offer sacrifices in themselves (spiritu - ally). Otherwise they are in their manner of life tlie best of men, and employ themselves wholly in the labors of agricul - ture.

This is the conduct of this people, who are more than four thousand in number. They never marry wives, nor endeavor after the possession of property; for they believe that the latter leads to injustice, and the former yields opportunities for domestic discord. Living by themselves, they serve each other. They choose good men, who are also priests, to be the stewards of their incomes and of the produce of the fields, a~ well as to procure them corn and food.” These accounts are the principal ancient testimonies as to the Essenes. Modern study has gathered other evidence from the records of Jewish tradition, through the labors especially of Rappaport, ‘the corypheus of Jewish critics,’ who found that what Philo and Josephus describe as peculiarities of the Essenes, tallies with what the Mishna, the Talmud and Midrashim record of the Khasidim, and that they [the Essenes] are most probably the so-called old believers, who are also described in the Talmud as the holy community in Jerusalem; who also rightly recognized in them an intensified form of Pharisaism, and re - marks that what is said in the Mishna about the moderation observed in eating and drinking, the great humility, endurance under sufferings, zeal for everything that is holy, community of goods, etc., refers to this holy community, or the Essenes. Rappaport, too, was the first who pointed out that the prayer which Josephus tells us the Essenes offered up at the rising of the sun, is the national hymn of praise, which still consti - tutes a part of the Jewish daily service, and is as follows: “He in mercy causes His light to shine upon the earth and upon the inhabitants thereof; and in His goodness unfailingly renews every day the wark of creation.

Praise Him all ye heavenly hosts; ascribe glory and majesty to Him, ye Seraphim, Ophanim, and holy Angela.” These, as Rappaport rightly remarks, are some of the remains of the ancient prayer used by the Essenes. Of Ewald’s view of the Essenes Dr. Ginsburg says, This profound and merciless critic, without having access to the Jewish information gathered from the Talmud and .Midrashim, saw that Essenism was no Greek plant transplanted into Palestine, but, like Pharisaism, grew out of the Ohasidim. He remarks that people, who left the great community in order to lead a specially holy life, with the permission and under the direction of the law, were to be found in Israel from the remotest times, yet in its first form there were only the Nazarites, of whom each one lived for himself; and in the second, the Rechabites combined themselves already into a larger union; but now the whole conscience of the people itself, as it were, departed into solitude with numerous Essenes. For it cannot be denied that they, proceeding from the Ohasidim, represent the direct and legitimate development of Judaism in the form which became the ruling one since Ezra. . . . Their"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"136 SEVENTEENTH DEGREE new features and endeavors merely consisted in their intensely earnest and rigorous application of the demands of the law, as understood and interpreted since Ezra. Finding that the rigorous and logical application of these laws was impossible in the great community, especially in that community as regu - lated by the Pharisees, they preferred to congregate and live in solitude. The studies of Frankel are held by Dr. Ginsburg to have been of the highest value for correct knowledge of the Essenes. Frankel substantiated, by numerous quotations from the Talmud, that the Essenes are the offspring of Judaism, that they are nothing but stationary, or more correctly speaking, consequential Chasidim, that they were therefore not so far distant from the Pharisees as to be regarded as a separate sect, but, on the contrary, that they formed a branch of Pharisaism. Two other learned investigators of the subject, Graetz and Jost, have accepted the same conclusions. The latter says, The Essenes are exactly the same that the other Rabbis wished to be who endeavored to practice tho Levitical law of purity, as leading to higher consecration. They have neither another creed nor another law, but simply institutions peculiar to this brotherhood, and endeavor to reach the highest consecration by their manner of life, in defining the different stages, ac - cording to preliminary exercises and certain yeai~s of prepara - tion. Their views and tenets are therefore also to be found in the utterances of the learned and the Rabbis who did not enter their order, so that they did not look upon the Essenes as opponents or apostates, but, on the contrary, as holding the same opinions with increased claims and some fewer enjoy - ments, whom many of their own midst joined. Graetz has lately maintained that Jesus simply appropriated to himself the essential features of Essenism, and that primitive Christi - anity was nothing but an offshoot from Essenism, a view which Dr. Ginsburg’s orthodoxy leads him to question. Re says, however, of Westcott’s article on the Essenes in Smith’s Dictionary of the Bibie,—His fear lest any shining virtues in"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE EAST AND WEST 137 the Essenes might be thought by some to pale some of the brightness of the Sun of Righteousness, prevented him from appreciating the true character of this Order, as well as from seeing that they paved the way to Christianity. Dr. Ginsburg also says of another eminent writer’s treatment of the subject, that “The description of the Essenes in the new edition of Dean Milman’s History of the Jews, gives a very imperfect idea both of the development and morality of this brother - hood.” The general opinion about the Essenes, Dr. Ginsburg states, has been largely based upon an account given by Dr. Thomas Godwyn, in a learned English work, which first appeared in 1625, and the statements of which, though drawn chiefly from Josephus and Philo, have been found incorrect and inadequate, in not a few respects, since later studies have brought forward much new evidence. One capital error of Godwyn’s account was in confounding the Essenes, who lived in Palestine, with the Therapeutae, who lived in Alexandria, and who made contemplation their chief aim, while the Essenes made practical holiness the chief thing. To complete Dr. Ginsburg’s account, it should be distinctly added that he does not think it necessary to4 admit, in view of the true story of Essenism, that Jesus was indebted to it for the Christian system of faith and life. He does almost say this while telling the story, but his opinion he thus expresses: “Those who style themselves the true evangelical Christians are very anxious to destroy every appearance of affinity between Essenism and Christianity, lest it should be said that the one gave rise to the other; whilst those who are termed Rationalists multiply and magnify every feature of resemblance, in order to show that Christianity is nothing but a development of Essenism— so that the poor Essenes are crucified between the two.” Essenism had fully developed a doctrine and practice of pure spiritual religion, not without marked limitations and eccentricities, yet with a purity and truth of religious senti - ment and life never surpassed. In it were found the great truths of God’s perfection in goodness and power, of the divine"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"138 SEVENTEENTH DEGREE law of human brotherhood, and of undefiled righteousness as the aim and law of life. That sweetness and humility which are deemed so significant signs of divine grace in the human heart, shone like stars of morning in the Essenistic practice of heavenly things. The best thought ever attained of human life visited by the divine light, was found by this sect of Jewish saints. No believers that ever were have more profoundly felt and more perfectly trusted the indwelling presence of God. This was the finest, as it was the most sober and most practical mysticism that this earth has ever seen. Whatever is possible to man, of marvelous exercise of exceptional power, in healing, in doing wonders upon body and mind, perhaps in shaking off the fixed grasp of death, was achieved by these pure confessors, whose stainless lives, whose spotless souls, commanded un - paralleled intimacy with heaven. As much as it is possible for the contemplative spirit to read the unrolled page of events, and to veritably foretell what is to be, these forecasting, watching, divinizing masters of grace and truth exercised the highest prophetic gift, and made daring mention of things which lay fully open to the divine eye only. They realized a communion the most brotherly ever known on earth, and celebrated it every day with sacrament simpler and more heavenly than any other which communism, religious or social, has been able to establish. It cannot be strongly enough rep - resented that they loved one another, and that they practiced a charity and kindness towards all men worthy a company of sons of God, and a forgiveness and compassion singularly divine. The great steps of reform which it is the latest effort of the modern world to initiate, they had taken with the clear intelligence of divine enlightenment and the unswerving courage of them that walk with God, and regard neither the fear nor the favor of man.

To inflict pain and shed blood is the destiny of almost every living thing that God has made; and His inflexible law makes mercy from one creature to another im - possible. Thousands must die that one may live. The whole world was never yet at peace. War seems the normal state of man; to kill, his pleasure, and to persecute, his luxury. The gods that loved human sacrifices were his most appropriate deities. To the civilized, as to the savage man, to the Christian, as to the heathen, the smell. of fresh blood is grateful. Men prey upon each other, as beast preys on beast; over the bodies of the dead, ambition always marches towards power; and everywhere and always man is man’s victim, and the hideous gospel of hate and murder is preached at the altars of Christian churches, and religion is deemed to consist in persecution and torture.

To all of us these flames symbolize the passions that infest the hearts of men,—ambition, avarice, lust, anger, envy, hatred, malevolence, intolerance, revenge,— against which Masonry has always warred. It is a mighty conflict, in which we must first gain the mastery over ourselves, and be vigilant lest our own unruly passions and many frailties overcome us.

To seek, therefore, to inculcate the truth of any particular creed, would be to make Masonry a realm of strife. It is the great primitive Truths revealed by God to the first men, and embodied in the old and often misunderstood symbols of the Orient, that we seek to find. Mutilated and disfigured, mingled with a thousand errors, misunderstood and perverted only, they have come down to the world at large. Masonry has preserved them by symbols and ceremonies, concerning herself exclusively with the great, leading, cardinal, indispensa - ble truths, which all Masons, of whatever creed, may admit and receive; and leaving each free to make such further and particular applications of her symbols as shall best suit the faith he professes. With these particular applications Ma - sonry has nothing to do. The great enigma that has in all ages tortured the human intellect, is the existence of sin and evil and wrong and pain and sorrow in the world. Ever since the first philosophy com - menced, man, looking at the evils which confront him every - where. . . has been asking himself these questions:—”If God be omnipotent, He could have prevented the existence of these evils: why does He allow them to exist? If without them such •a world as ours could not in the nature of things exist, He is omniscient, and knew before He framed it what it would be, and how evil would reign in it; why, then, if He be good and wise, did He create it at all? How are the existence of wicked - ness and misery, the prosperity of the bad, and the suffering and servitude of the good, to be reconciled with His infinite mercy and love? Is He not infinitely merciful and loving? Has he made this world and us, to amuse Himself with our pitiful strifes and wars, our hangings and burnings and tortur - ings, our contortions and writhings in agony,—the broad farce we are always playing in the presence of His angels?” “We can judge,” he has said, “of God’s motive in creating the universe, solely from the things that exist and those that"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"KNIGHT ROSE CROIX, OF THE EAGLE, OR PELICAN 171 are done, in that universe. He in.te-nded and desired all that takes place in it. He meant to make a world of sin and misery, and pain and sorrow and shame. Virtue is not rewarded in it, nor vice punished, because it pleases Him that it should be so.” Wherefore, in order to escape from the conclusion that either malevolence or mere indifference was His motive, and unable to comprehend how He could be the author of evil, and seeing darkness ever contending and alternating with the light, and evil with good, everywhere in the world, and in every soul that lives, he said: “There are two distinct powers in the universe, one of evil and one of good, ever warring against each other with varied fortunes.” To the Oriental imagination, the proofs of this were seen everywhere,—in the alternations of day and night, in the declination and ascension of the sun, in the constant conflict in every man’s own bosom between his moral sense and appetites, his reason and his passions, his spiritual and his earthly nature. Light, summer, the sun, the constellations which the sun entered from March until September, all became types and symbols of the Principle of Good; and darkness, winter, and the other constellations, led by the Serpent and Scorpion, became types and symbols of the Principle of Evil. The ever-varying fortunes of the sun, his descent in winter to the Tropic of Capricorn, allegorically called his Death, and his annual ascension from that point after remaining stationary for three days, were personified in legends, whose heroes differed with the different nations that received them. Hence the myths of Osuus, ATYS, ADONIS, CAMA, Hu, DIONUSOS, and KHUXUM. “Is this alternation to be eternal? Is evil always, during all eternity, thus to divide in equal balance the sovereignty of the universe with good? Is it ultimately to prevail? Is the regeneration of the human race impossible? Must wrong and vice and crime always prosper, and right and virtue always be depressed?”"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"172 EIGHTEENTH DEGREE Out of these questions, chiefly, grew the old philosophies, and the old religions. Men could not believe that evil was V ultimately to conquer, for then IT would be God; and the t will of God, they said, is the only foundation of the Moral 1; Law: and so, with that victory, vice would become a duty, C and the virtues crimes; nor that the alternating fortunes of a U light and darkness, good and evil, are to be eternal; for then, b they said, “God is either not omnipotent, because He cannot end the reign of evil, or He does not desire to do so, and then He is not infinitely good and wise.” Thus the antagonism of the good and evil Principles, and the necessity and certainty of the coming, at some time, of a Warrior, a Hero, a Messiah, a Saviour or a Redeemer, who b should conquer and destroy the Principle of evil, Typhon, r Ahriman, Iswara, Satan, with his daevas, demons and fallen angels, have been articles in all creeds from the earliest ages b of the world. This has ever been the great problem that, more than all A others, has vexed the human mind—whether any power of good has already commenced, or will hereafter commence, that a combat with the Principle and Power of evil, in which this is C ultimately to be overcome and destroyed; whether sin and B sorrow and calamity and pain are hereafter to disappear from the universe, and all thenceforward to be light and happiness and joy; whether there is for man another life, in which com - pensation will be made for the sufferings of virtue and the calamities of the good in this life. For it is the great problem, whether the world is dark or light; whether philosophy is not mere jargon, and religion an empty word; whether we shall act more wisely by serving and thanking God, or by attempt - ing to propitiate the devil; whether there be in reality ANY God, any great, good, beneficent FATHERLY Deity, who loves ALL His children, and cares for them, and will in His own good time connect together all the thousand links of circum - stance into one good and excellent result, and annihilate the Principle and Power of evil, and all his works. * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"KNIGHT ROSE CROIX, OF THE EAGLE, OR PELICAN 173 It is a most important question, to us and to all men, whether in the long process of time the Principle of good is to prevail, and that of evil to disappear; whether this world is one great harmony, or a mere aggregate of confused dis - cords; whether the cycles of good and evil are eternal, as God and time are; or whether all is the fruit of one great harmo - nious plan, perfect, as God Himself is perfect, and dictated by an infinite beneficence and infinite love. * * * * * * by .

In no other way could Masonry preserve its character of universality, which has always been peculiar to it from its origin; and which enabled two kings, worshippin~g the Deity under different names, to sit together as Grand Masters, while the walls of the first Temple arose; and the men of Gebal, who adored the Phcenician gods, to work by the side of the Hebrews, to whom those gods were an abomination, and sit with them in the same Lodge as Brethren. * * * * * * In the EAST of every Lodge, over the Master, hangs the initial letter, or the whole, of the Name of Deity; and you early learned to call the East the Place of Light.
