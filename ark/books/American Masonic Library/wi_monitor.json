WISCONSIN MONITOR 7 MASONIC JURISPRUDENCE It is ESSENTIAL that all Masons, especial - ly OFFICERS OF LODGES, should be well grounded in Masonic Law and well informed in regard to the customs and usages of the Craft. This knowledge may best be obtained by a thor - ough reading and study of the “Constitution, Laws, and Edicts of the Grand Lodge,” the By - Laws of the Subordinate Lodges, and by con - versation with well informed brethren. A MASON’S DUTY The duty devolves upon every Mason, no mat - ter what his occupation, to preserve the reputa - tion of the Fraternity unsullied. If the conduct of an individual member tends to bring Mason - ry into disrepute or to injure the Institution, such conduct is unmasonic and should not be allowed to remain unnoticed. EXAMINATION AND AVOUCHMENT By regulation of this Grand Jurisdiction there are only two modes of avouchment allowed in a Subordinate Lodge. 1:—By a brother who has sat in Lodge with the visitor. 2:—By an examination had by order of the rank - ing officer. r"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 WISCONSIN MONITOR WISCONSIN MONITOR 9 Documentary evidence cannot be permitted to take the place of “strict examination”.

So help me God. RECEPTION OF GRAND MASTER The Grand Master, being in waiting in the Ante-room, is announced by the Tiler, and this announcement is reported by the Junior Deacon to the Worshipful Master. The Worshipful Master orders the Senior Deacon or some other ranking officer, to meet the Grand Master at the door and escort him to the Altar. The Grand Master is welcomed at the Altar by the Wor - shipful Master, after which the Senior Deacon (or other officer) is ordered to escort him to the East, or the Worshipful Master may conduct him. Arriving in the East, the Worshipful Master introduces the Grand Master to the brethren and the Grand Honors are given. (Battery.) The Worshipful Master will then offer his gavel and station to the Grand Master. If the Grand Master declines to preside, the Worship - ful Master will resume. The Grand Master comes into the Lodge-room covered; the Worshipful Master uncovers when the Grand Master enters; no other brethren to be admitted into the Lodge with him; if breth - ren seek admission they must enter before or after the Grand Master has been received. Grand Officers other than the Grand Master, are received in the same manner, except that the Worshipful Master does not offer his station or gavel, nor are they covered. Grand Officers, as well as all permanent mem - bers of the Grand Lodge, are entitled to be re - ceived with the Grand Honors and to a seat in the East.

The Twenty-four inch Gauge is an instru - ment made use of by operative Masons, to meas - ure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It being divided into twen - ty-four equal parts, is emblematic of the twen - ty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and the relief of a distressed worthy brother, eight for our usual avocations, and eight for refreshment and sleep. The Common Gavel is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Ma - sons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our minds and consciences of the vices and super - fluities of life, thereby fitting us as living stones for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

The greatest of these is Charity; for our Faith will be lost in sight, Hope ends in fruition, but Charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. ENTERED APPRENTICE 27 FURNITURE The furniture of a Lodge is the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses. The Bible is dedicated to God, the Square to the Master, and the Com - passes to the Craft. The Bible is dedicated to God, it being the in - estimable gift of God to man, * ~ ~ the Square to the Master, it being the proper emblem of his office, and should continually re - mind him of the duty he owes to the Lodge over which he is elected to preside; and the Compass - es to the Craft, for by a due attention to their use they are taught to circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds with all mankind. ORNAMENTS The ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the Indented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematic of hu - man life, checkered with good and evil; the Beautiful Border which surrounds it, of those"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"28 WISCONSIN MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE 29 blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. LIGHTS A Lodge has three lights, situated east, west and south—none in the north; none in the north because, ~ * * * • -~ ~ ~ Z A Lodge has six je~s—three imm~vable and three movable. The inunovable Jewels are the Square, Level and Plumb. The Square teaches morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of con - duct. The movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle-board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adjusted by the working tools of the Fellow Craft. The Trestle- board is for the master workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Per- feet Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle-board we are also reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his Trestle-board, so should we, both operative and speculative, en - deavor to erect our spiritual building agree - ably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Great Book of Nature and Revelation, which is our spiritual, moral and Masonic Trestle-board. LODGES—HOW SITUATED All Lodges are, or ought to be, situated due east and west, because King Solomon’s Temple was so situated; King Solomon’s Temple was so situated because, after Moses had safely con - ducted the Children of Israel through the Red Sea, when pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he, by Divine command, erected a tabernacle and situated it due east and west, to perpetuate the remembrance of that remarkable east wind which wrought their mighty deliverance, and likewise the better to receive the rays of the rising sun. As this tabernacle was a model for King Solomon’s Temple, so ought all Lodges to be situated due east and west."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"________________ - — - —~---—---—~-- ------ —--~ 30 WISCONSIN MONITOR DEDICATION ~‘ Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Sol - omon, who was said to have been our first Most Excellent Grand Master. But Masons, in mod - ern times, dedicate theirs to St. John the Bap - tist and St. John the Evangelist, who were said to have been two eminent Christian patrons of Masonry; and since their time there is, or ought to be, represented in every regular and well governed Lodge, a certain Point within a Circle; the Point representing an individual brother, the Circle the boundary line of his duty, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions or pre - judices to betray him. This Circle is embor - dered by two perpendicular parallel lines, repre - senting St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist; upon the top rest the Holy Scrip - tures. In passing around this Circle we neces - sarily touch upon both lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures, and while.~ a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed it is impossible that he should materially err. TENETS ~ The tenets of our profession are Brotherly !~ Love, Relief and Truth. K ENTERED APPRENTICE 31 BROTHERLY LOVE :—By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family—the high and low, the rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are bound to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. ~‘ RELIEF :—To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but more particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissol - uble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. TRUTH is a Divine attribute, and the foun - dation of every virtue. To be good men and true is the first lesson taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate and by its dictates endeavor tQ regulate our conduct.

Were I to ask you * * * * . They are four * * * and allude to the four cardinal virtues, Temperance, Fortitude, Pru - dence and Justice. p~’ TEMPERANCE is that due restraint upon our affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or contracting any licentious or v 4 cious habit, the indulgence of which might lead him to dis - close some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would -consequently subject him to the contempt and detestation of all goo~ XVIa~<ons. * * * * * * FORTITUDE is that noble and steady pur - pose of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril, or danger, when prudentially deemed ~xpedient. This vir - tue is equally distant from rashness and coward - ice, and like the former, should be deeply im - pressed upon the mind of every Mason, as a safeguard or security against any illegal at - tack that may be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from him any of those valuable secrets with which he has been so solemnly intrusted, and which was emblematically represented upon his first admission into the Lodge. -~ S * * * * * ~ ~ PRUDENCE teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge, and prudentially determine on all things relative to our present as well as to our future happiness. This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the World. It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token or word whereby the secrets of iViasonry might be unlawfully ob - tained.

There are three great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never mentioning His name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable under - takings, and to esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the Square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you. And to yourself, in avoiding all ir - regularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties or debase the dignity of your pro - fession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet and peace - ful subject, true to your government and just to your country.

At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will always be as ready to give, as you will be ready to receive instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mys - teries of the Fraternity, as these are to distin - guish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Ma - sonry, be particularly careful not to recommend him unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules, that the honor, glory, and reputa - tion of the Institution may be firmly establish - ed, and the wor]d at large convinced of its good effects. * * * * ~ * *"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FE LLOWCRAPT FELLOWCRAFT FIRST SECTION * * * * * * The Square of Virtue should be the rule and guide of our conduct in all future transactions with mankind.

By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of ~he useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence will result a due propor - tion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelter from the vicissftudes and inclemencies of seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and indusl;ry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligation to pay that ration - al homage to Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the con - templative to view with reverence and admir - ation the glorious works of creation, and in - spires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfection of his Divine Creator. We work in Speculative Masonry only, but our ancient brethren wrought in Operative as well as Speculative Masonry. * * * * They worked six days before receiving their wages, but did not work on the seventh, for in six days God created the Heaven and the earth, and rested upon the seventh day; the seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoy - ing frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of creation, and to adore their great Creator. * S * * * * PILLARS PEACE, UNITY and PLENTY * * * * * * These globes are two artificial spherical bodies, on the convex surfaces of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other important particulars.

THE USE OF THE GLOBES Their principal use, besides serving as maps to distinguish the outward parts of the earth and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illus - trate and explain the phenomena arising from the annual revolution of the earth around the sun, and the diurnal rotation upon its own axis. They are the noblest instruments for improv - ing the mind, giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or proposition, as well as en - abling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due rever - ence for Deity and His works, and are induced to encourage the studies of Astronomy, Geogra - phy, Navigation, and the Arts dependent on them, by which society has been so much bene - fited. * * * * * * 3—5—7 Ther,e are three degrees conferred in every regular and well governed Lodge. The three principal officers are the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE By order in architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is the regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a build - ing, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole. OF ITS ANTIQUITY From the first formation of society order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive sheller from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across the top to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at the top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. CLASSIFICATION The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. The ancienl and original orders of architec - ture, revered by Masons, are no more than three, the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"WISCONSIN MONITOR 46 FELLOWORAFT 47 Romans have added two; the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric; and the Com - posite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three alone show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other, the oth - ers have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Corinthian enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, are we indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in architecture. * * * * * * THE FIVE HUMAN SENSES Which are Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. The first three, Hearing, Seeing and Feeling, are deemed peculiarly essential aiming Masons. * * * * The SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES are Gramma~r, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy. The fifth, Geometry, is most revered by Ma - sons. By this science the Architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general to arrange his soldiers; the engineer to mark ou I; ground for encampments; the geographer to give us the dimensions of the world and all things therein contained; to de - lineate the extent of seas, and specify the divi - sions of empires, kingdoms and provinces; by it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the foundation of architecture, and the root of mathematics. * * * * The number Seven is held in high estimation among Masons. * * * * * * What does it denote?

By Geometry, we may curiously trace nature, through her various windings, to her most concealed recesses. By it we discover the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the Grand Artificer of I;he Universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their different orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the Divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, FELLOWORAFT 49 being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignor - ance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnifi - cent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstand - ing, has still survived. The Attentive Ear re - ceives the sound from the Instructive Tongue, and the mysteries of Masonry are safely lodged in the repository of Faithful Breasts. Tools and implements of architecture, and symbolic emblems most expressive, are selected by the Fraternity to imprint on the mind wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succes - sion of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired, the excellent tenets of our Institution. * * * * * * G r I"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"1 50 WISCONSIN MONITOR CHARGE Being passed to the Fellow Craft degree, we congratulate you on your preferment.

THE BEE-HIVE The Bee-Hive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in Heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that, as we came into the world ra - tional and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones, never sitting down content-. ed while our fellow creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve them without inconvenience to ourselves.

In case of the death of a present or past Grand Lodge Officer, notice should be inunedi. ately sent to the Grand Master or Grand Secre - tary.

The apron must always be worn on the outside of the coat. The most profound solemnity and decorum should be observed in a funeral Lodge, in the public exercises and in the procession.

Again we are assembled among the habita - tions of “the silent city”, to behold the “narrow house” appointed for all living. Around us, in that peace which the world can - not give, sleep the unnumbered dead. The gentle breeze fans their verdant covering—they heed it not; the sunshine and the storm pass over them—they are not disturbed. Stones and let - tered monuments symbolize the affection of surviving relatives and friends, yet no sound proceeds from them save that silent but thrill - ing admonition, “seek ye the narrow path and the straight gate that lead unto eternal life.” We are again admonished of the uncertainty of life, the immutable certainty of death, and the vanity of all human pursuits. Decrepitude and decay are written on every living thing. The cradle and the coffin stand side by side; and it is a melancholy truth that, as soon as we begin this earthly life, that moment we begin to die. The last Qmces we pay to the dead are useless except as they contribute lessons for the living. The cold form enclosed in the “narrow house” before us is alike insensible to our sorrows and our ceremonies. He has gone to accomplish the destiny of all our race, and his body to the profound slumber of the grave, there to be resolved with its original elements. What, then, are all the externals of human dignity—the power of wealth, the dreams of ambition, the pride of intellect, or the charms of beauty—when nature has paid her just debt? The monarch at whose bidding nations pay obedience, and the poor begger at his gate, are equals in the hour of death. The one must part with his sceptre and crown; the other has no further use for his wallet and rags; and each is indebted to Mother Earth for a common sepulchre. In the grave all ranks are leveled, all distinctions are done away. Our present meeting and proceedings will have been vain and useless if they fail to excite our serious reflections and strengthen our reso - lutions for amendment.

It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.

Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shal] sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on in- corruption, and this mortal put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on in- corruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. 0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory? As the Chaplain pronounces the concluding words, “0 grave, where is thy victory?” the lights in the room will be raised to brilliancy, and the four brethren seated around the catafalqno will relight the tapers. The Chaplain will return to his place in the East, and a suitable ode of a cheerful character will be sung. The Orator will then pronounce the Eulogium. Another appropriate ode may be sung. ~CLOSING THE LODGE W.

Answer these questions, as Masons should answer. S. W.—Man judgeth not of man. He whose infinite and tender mercy passeth all compre - hension, whose goodness endureth forever, has called our brethren hence. Let Him judge. In ancient Egypt no one could gain admit - tance to the sacred asylum of the tomb until he had passed under the most solemn judgment before a grave tribunal."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"106 WESCONSIN MONITOR LODGE OF SORROW 107 Princes and peasants came there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted the history of their lives, and threw the penetrating light of truth on all their actions. If it were adjudged that the dead man had led an evil life, his memory was condemned in the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepul - ture. But Masonry has no such tribunal to sit in judgment upon her dead; with her, the good that her sons have done lives after them, and the evil is buried with their bones. She does require, however, that whatever is said concern - ing them shall be the truth; and should it ever happen that a Mason dies of whom nothing good can truthfully be said, she will mournfully and pityingly bury him out of her sight in si - lence.

The honor, reputation and usefulness of your Lodge will materially depend on the skill and assiduity with which you manage its concerns; while the happiness of its members will be generally promoted in proportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the gen - uine principles of our Institution. For a pattern of imitation consider the great luminary of nature, which, rising in the east, regularly diffuses light and lustre to all within its circle. In like manner, it is your province to spread and communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your Lodge. Forcibly im - press upon them the dignity and high impor - tance of Masonry, and seriously admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to practice, out of the Lodge, those duties which have been taught in it, and by amiable, discreet and vir - tuous conduct, to convince mankind of the good - ness of the Institution; so that, when any one is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows; to whom dis - tress may prefer its suit; whose hand is guid - ed by justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence. In short, by a diligent; observance of the By-Laws of your Lodge, the Constitutions of Masonry, and above all the Holy Scriptures, which are given as a rule and guide to our faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with honor and reputation, and lay up a crown of rejoicing, x’~hich shall continue when time shall be no more.

Suffice it to mention that what you have seen praiseworthy in others, you should carefully imitate; and what in them may have appeared defective you should in your - selves amend. You should be examples of good order and regularity, for it is only by a due regard to the laws, in your own conduct, that you can expect obedience to them from others. You are assiduously to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust, diffusing light and im - parting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of the Master you will succeed to higher duties; your acquire - ments must therefore be such that the Craft may never suffer for want of proper ins t;ruction. From the spirit which you have hitherto evinced, I entertain no doubt that your future conduct will be such as to merit the applause of your brethren, and the promptings of a good conscience. TO THE BRETHREN Brethren of — Lodge No.—; Such is the nature of our Constitution that, as some must necessarily rule and teach, so others must of course learn to submit and obey. Humility in both is an essential duty. The officers who have been selected to govern your Lodge are sufficiently conversant with the rules of pro- priety and the laws of the Institution, to avoid exceeding the powers with which they are en - trusted; and you are of too generous dispositions to envy their preferment. I therefore trust that you will have but one aim; to please each other, and unite in the grand design of being happy and communicating happiness. Finally, my brethren, as this Fraternity has been formed and perfected in so much unanimity and concord, in which we greatly rejoice, so may it long continue. May you long enjoy every satisfaction and delight which disinter - ested friendship can afford. May kindness and brotherly affection distinguish your conduct as men and as Masons. Within your peaceful walls may your children’s children celebrate with joy and gratitude the transactions of this auspicious solemnity. And may the tenets of our profession be transmitted through your Lodge, pure and unimpaired, from generation to generation.

These ceremonies cannot be per - formed on Sunday nor if the walls of the edifice are erected or practically so.

The foundation stone, if it be for a Masonic building, is usually placed in the north-east cor - ner AND SHOULD BE ENGRAVED WITH THE DATE AND YEAR OF MASONRY AND ThE GRAND MASTER’S NAME. As the foundation upon which the entire structure is supposed to rest, it is considered by operative Masons as the most important stone in the edifice.
