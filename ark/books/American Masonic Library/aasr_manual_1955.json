It developed from a system of twenty- five so-called “higher degrees” which flourished in France in the mid-Eighteenth Century and which came to be known as THE Rim oP PERPECTION. Theie is evidence that some of these degrees had an ancestral source also in England and Scotland. In 1740, the first Ecossais (Scottish) Lodge — Parfaite Harmonie — was organized in Bordeaux, one of the oldest and most influential Masonic centers in France. The membership included Scotch and English Masons. The line of descent, beginning with Bordeaux, runs through the Sovereign Council Sublime Ecossais Mother Lodge in Paris, the Chapter of Clermont, Knights of the East, Emperors of the East and West, and the Rite of Seven Degrees of England. In 1761, the Masonic authorities in France granted a Patent to Stephen Morn of Bordeaux to carry the advanced degrees across the sea to America. In or about 1763, Morin established these degrees in the West Indies. Within a few years, other degrees were added until the Rite had a ritual structure of thirty-three degrees — the first three being exemplified in a Symbolic Lodge. Henry Andrew Francken (1720-1795), deputized by Stephen Morin, organized a Lodge of Perfection in Albany, New York, in 1767 — the beginning of what was to become the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite in the United States. During the Colonial period, Deputies appointed by Morn organized Masonic groups conferring —1—"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"EL~ 2 A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS the advanced degrees at important points along the Atlantic sea - board. These groups were independent, without centralized super - vision or control, except to agree that their authority came from Jamaica and Stephen Morn. On May 31, 1801, Tam Susosixz~ta COUNCIL OP Tam Tausm’ - THIRD DEGREE FOR THE UNITED STATES 01’ AMERICA was founded in Charleston, South Carolina, in an elfort to unify competing groups and bring Masonic order out of chaos. Hence the motto — Ordo ab Chao. Later, the name was changed to Tam ANCIENT AND ACCEPTED Sco-rnsH RITE. The full membership of this Supreme Council con - sisted of eleven Grand Inspectors General who signed the original Register of 1802. Of these eleven, nine were born abroad but — in war and peace — had proved their loyalty to the United States. In religion, four were Jews, five were Protestants and two were Roman Catholic. The Scottish Rite was an effective catalyst welding these men into an intimate and fraternal fellowship. On August 5, 1813, Emanuel De La Motta, 330, of Savannah, Georgia, a distinguished Jewish meichant and philanthropist and Grand Treasurei General of the Supreme Council at Charleston, organized — in the City of New York — “The Supreme Council of the Thirty-third Degree for the Northern District and Jurisdiction of the United States of America.” Daniel Decius Tompkins, 330, afterward (18 16-1824) Vice President of the United States, was chosen Sovereign Grand Commander and John James Joseph Gourgas, 330, Grand Secretary General. In 1827, the territory of the northern Masonic Jurisdiction com - prised the area now occupied by the following fifteen States Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connect - icut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, Mich - igan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin. The Northern and Southern Jurisdictions made slow progress in unifying the scattered degree-conferring groups and in standardizing rituals. They were handicapped by pride in the local organization and leadership jealousies; by the Anti-Masonic agitation (1827-1840) which almost destroyed Freemasonry; by the War Between the States, 1861-1 865, and by periods of depression. The process of unification in the Northern Jurisdiction was completed in the Union of 1867 — the beginning of a new era of growth in numbers and influence. I 4 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 3 Between 1813 and 1867, several irregular Supreme Councils in - fluenced by Joseph Cerneau (1763-1840?) challenged the authority of the regular Supreme Council.

Van Rensselaer 1860-1867 The story of these turbulent years is recorded in detail in Vol. I (pp. 165-467) of Scottish Rite Freemasonry, N.M.J. by Samuel Harrison Baynard, Jr., 330 (1938) On May 15-17, 1867, in a spirit of amity and fraternal coopera- tion, two competing Supreme Councils operating in the North — the Van Rensselaer Council and the Hays-Raymond Council — met in Freemasons’ Hall in Boston and formed what was to be called “The Union of 1867.” The fifty-six Active Members continued in oflice. The limit fixed by the Constitutions was 66.

Officers should study the latest revision of the Constitu - tions, especially the sections dealing with Subordinate Bodies, Members, Candidates and Rituals. Bodies of the Scottish Rite in a given Valley are subordi - nate to the Supreme Council but co-ordinate in relation to each other. Each operates under its own Dispensation or Charter. They are co-equal. No Presiding Officer outranks another. For purposes of common action and in the interest of unified and effective management, it is recommended that an Executive Board — or Committee — be organized with the following suggested personnel: Presiding Officers of Co - ordinate Bodies, the second Officer of each Body, one or more representatives of the Trustees, the Treasurer and the Secretary of the Scottish Rite Bodies. An Active Member of the Supreme Council, resident in the Valley, may be a voting member of the Executive Board or he may serve as Consultant. The revised Constitutions provide that an Active Member of the Supreme Council cannot be an officer of a Scottish Rite Body in any local Valley. No one — except the Treasurer, Secretary and Hospitaler — should hold office in more than one Scottish Rite Body at one and the same time. 1,) “LADDER PROMOTION” Ladder Promotion should not be accepted as a fixed prac - tice. It is good policy to keep the “Line” short. This is subject to the Constitutions of the Supreme Council and to the Rules and Regulations operative in the Valley. The important consideration is acceptability and competence in leadership. ALLEGIANCE The approved form of Allegiance which should appear on official notices and in Scottish Rite papers is as follows: The Bodies of the Scottish Rite, sitting in the Valley of District of acknowledge and yield allegiance to the Supreme Coun - cil, 330, Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the United States of America, whose Grand East is in Boston, Massachusetts, and whose Officers are — Ill:.

Addresses optional. —4-- L"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6 A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS CO-ORDINATE BODIES 7 OFFICIAL DECLARATION Note that the Official Declaration as prescribed by the Constitutions is to be used only in Opening or Closing a Body of the Scottish Rite. It is not to be used in opening or closing a ritualistic Degree. This Declaration, which is an affirma - tion of allegiance, is weakened by too frequent repetition. “To the glory of the Grand Architect of the Universe; in the name and under the auspices of the Supreme Council of Sovereign Grand Inspectors General of the Thirty-third and Last Degree of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the United States of America, and by virtue of the authority upon me conferred, I declare the works of (here mention the name of the body) opened (or closed, as the case may be).” NOTE: In the ceremonial of the Joint Installation of Officers, the form presented on page 11 of Forms And Ceresnonials should be substituted for the Official Decla - ration. It is not necessary to announce a change of Degrees within the same Body if an official program has been issued. When announcement must be made, the Presiding Officer — or one deputized by him — may say: “I declare this closed on the Degree and opened on the Degree.” JOINT MEETINGS To facilitate the transaction of business, joint meetings of the Co-ordinate Scottish Rite Bodies may be held — subject to official notice. This notice should bear the names of all the Presiding Officers. The Secretary should transcribe the records in the Minute Book of each Body. The Presiding Officer of that Body which is the Fiscal Agency may preside or, by mutual arrangement, the Presiding Officers may serve in rotation. In opening the joint meeting, make a necessary adaptation of the Official Declaration or see Page 11 of Forms And Ceremonials. Care should be taken to obviate the voting in a Body by one who is not a member of that Body although a member of~ another Body participating in the Joint Meeting. OATH OF FEALTY It is important that the Candidates be impressed that the Oath of Fealty is a symbol of the unity of the Scottish Rite. This Oath of Fealty protects the Body of the Rite against potentially unworthy Candidates and assures the initiate that he is entering a legally constituted Scottish Rite Body — not one which is clandestine, illegal or spurious. FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPUTY AND ACTIVE MEMBERS (1) It is imperative for every Officer to acl~nowledge the authority of the Deputy of~ the Supreme Council in his District (State) and to be familiar with the wide range of his duties as specified in the Constitutions. As the official repre - sentative of the Supreme Council and of the Sovereign Grand Commander, he inspects the work of the Rite in the various Valleys and must see that the general laws and rituals of the Rite are respected and obeyed, and that the official rituals are strictly exemplified without deviation."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS The Deputy is always available for counsel and for such visitations as are mutually convenient, but a fraternal con - sideration should protect him from unreasonable demands. (2) Officers should be familiar with the status, duties and privileges of an Active Member of the Supreme Council as defined in the Constitutions. In general, an Active Member exercises no formal authority except such as may be conferred upon him by the Deputy. He may be a member of the Executive Board — or Committee — in his Valley and may preside as ex-officio Chairman at meetings of the Honorary Members of the Supreme Council in his Valley. He does not represent his Valley or District in the Supreme Council but he does represent the Supreme Council in his Valley and District. He must report any irregularities in ritual or business to the Deputy. As a counselor he works in close cooperation with the Officers of the Valley. HONORARY MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL As Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, the Honorary Members of the Supreme Council should be given formal recognition on ceremonial occasions. It is their privilege and duty to cooperate with the Deputy, the Resident Active and the Officers of the Scottish Rite in the local Valley in pro - viding leadership, in conserving the interests of the Supreme Council and in strengthening the influence of the Scottish Rite. III PROTOCOL DEFINITION Protocol covers the more important details of ceremonial etiquette — the conduct of meetings, the introduction and reception of distinguished guests, good form in the wearing of jewels and other decorations, and the order of precedence in seating guests on the platform and at the banquet table. NOTE: The word “precedence” frequently referred to is pronounced “pre-seed-ens” with accent on the second sylla - ble. In Webster’s New Issternatiossal Dictionary there is a wide range of its application in terms of rank and order. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS A general knowledge of Parliamentary Law is essential, especially the forms of putting motions, directing debate, rules governing amendments and the like. A meeting need not be stiff or ultra-formal but it is imperative to maintain order and dignity. Recommended: Robert’s Ru!es of Order or A Manual of Parliamentary Procedure by John Q. Tilson, 33 ~. INTRODUCTION AND RECEPTION OF GUESTS 1. Follow traditional procedures in the appointment of carefully chosen Committees to escort the various guests, and in the formal reception under an arch of steel which is reserved for a Grand Master of Masons and for Active Mem - bers of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of any Jurisdiction in amity. The escort will “Present Swords” whenever all other guests are formally received. —9—"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"10 A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS INTRODUCTION AND RECEPTION OF GUESTS 11 2. If the Resident Active Member of the Supreme Coun - cil is present, he should be received first. After accepting the gavel, he will receive all the other distinguished guests — unless the Deputy for the District is in attendance. In that case, the Resident Active will receive the Deputy who, in turn, will receive all guests. 3. Be governed by the Order of Precedence of the Grand Lodge or by an adaptation of the group pat tern used by the Supreme Council. This group pattern is as follows: (1) Masonic Service Association; the Shrine; National Sojourness; Red Cross of Constantine; Royal Order of Scotland; Order of DeMolay. (2) Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons; Grand Council Royal and Select Masters; Grand Commandery Knights Templar. (General Grand Bodies in the same order.) (3) Foreign Supreme Councils (Europe and Latin America). (4) English Speaking Supreme Councils. (Outside U.S.A.) Ireland, England, Scotland, Dominion of Canada. (5) Southern Masonic Jurisdiction, U.S.A. The Mother Supreme Council. (7) Any visiting Deputy of the Supreme Council. (8) The Sovereign Grand Commander — or h~s Official Representative. (9) The Grand Master of Masons. Nom: If the Deputy for the District is present, he should greet the Sovereign Grand Commander as the Altar, escort him to the East, introduce him to the Presiding Offscer and to the Brethren, present the gavel and call for the Grand Honora. (The Battery of the Degree under which the Body is operating.) If the Deputy or an Active Member f or the District is not present, the Preaiding Officer will observe the procedure as outlined above. If the Sovereign Grand Commander has been received and the Grand Master of Masons is in waiting, it is Isis privilege to greet the Grand Master, escort him to the East, present the gavel and call for the Grand Honors. If a Grand Master of Masons — or any other distin - guished guest — is not a Scottish Rite Mason, the Presiding Officer, without the knowledge of the guest, should declare a recess. Resume — when the guess is escorted from the room. 4. On the occasion of an official visit to a Valley by the Deputy for the District, the Deputy may be escorted by the Honorary Members of the Supreme Council resident in that Valley or elsewhere in the District. ~. It is important that formal dignity be maintained. Introductions should be brief — no biographical data, no fulsome compliments. It is sufficient to say, “I have the honor to present “ (Give name and Masonic title.) Do not use the cliche — “present to you and through you.” In presenting the Sovereign Grand Commander do not rehearse (6) Active Members of the Supreme Council, N.M.J."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"12 A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS the full corporate title of the Jurisdiction used in the Official Declaration. “Ill .. , 330, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council 330 for the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the United States of America” — is adequate. In receiving a distinguished guest never, under any cir - cumstances, greet him by his first name. That intimacy is for private and unofficial conversation. It is proper to add a brief, friendly word of appreciation of the honor of the visit and an assurance of a sincere and hearty Masonic welcome. NOTE: The formal ceremony of Reception may be waived at the request of a guest. TABLE PROTOCOL The ranking Masonic officer present should be seated on the right of the Presiding Officer and, next to him, the speaker of the evening. The second highest ranking officer is seated at the left of the Toastmaster. All others — includ - ing civic officials — are placed in order alternating right and left. Local custom should be followed and it is not essential to be too meticulous. Seating is facilitated when place cards are used. Novn. If the Toastmaster is a person other than the Pre - siding Officer, he should be seated at the left of the Presiding Officer. 4 H IC S INTRODUCTION AND RECEPTION OF GUESTS 13 GRAND HONORS LODGE or PERPECTION 3~5.79 COUNCIL OP PRINCES or JERUSALEM +++++ 4.1 (Substituted for the battery of 1-4 in the 160 to avoid conflict with the battery of the 320) CHAPThR or ROSE Cnoxx ++++++ + 6-1 CONSISTORY 1-4 1~"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"p.— DECORATIONS IV DECORATIONS DEFINITION In the Supreme Council NEWS-LEtTER for July 1948, Ill.~.

(c) All Decorations expressly authorized by the laws of the United States of America, or one of its States, or of some foreign government reoognized by and at peace with the United States. b DECORATIONS TO BE WORN The Decorations described above are the only ones author - ized to be worn in a Scottish Rite meeting, except that an officer or representative of an organization being officially received in the Supreme Council or in any of its subordinate Bodies is entitled to wear the jewel or decoration oF his Body. —14—"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"r “FORM” IN FREEMASONRY V “FORM” IN FREEMASONRY I. Freemasonry has its own unique meaning of the word “form,” sanctioned by traditional usage. In dictionary terms it is “a mode of procedure prescribed by custom.” For example, when a candidate is received “in due and ancient form,” every Freemason knows what is meant. 2. There is a confused and mistaken notion that three familiar terms — “In ample form,” “In due form” and “In form” refer to the ritual used in opening or closing a Masonic Body. “Ample form” is thought to be a full ritualistic form, while the others are shorter. That is a misuse of words. Ever since the Anderson Constitutions of 1738, these terms have been used, not to describe how the meeting was opened or closed, but to specify who did it. 3. In his Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Ill.~. Albert C. Mackey, 330, accurately defines these terms. “‘When the Grand Lodge is opened by the Grand Master in person, it is said to be opened in ample form; when by the Deputy Grand Master, it is said to be in due form; when by any other qual - ified officer, it is said to be in form. 4. That mle holds in the Scottish Rite. “In a subordinate body of Freemasonry, including the Scottish Rite, if the titu - lar head of that body — the regular presiding officer — opens or closes the body, it is done ‘in due form.’ If any other authorized officer performs this office it is done simply ‘in form.’” (1943 N.M.J. 130) 17 “FORM” IN OFFICIAL NOTICES The announcement that certain degrees will be conferred “in ample form” is not proper. Scottish Rite degrees are ,, “ “conferred” either by being “exemplified or communi- cated.” It is permissible to announce that a given degree will be “exemplified in full ceremonial form.” That is merely a rhetorical emphasis. 7 I 2( —16— V"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"RITUALS 19 VI RITUALS CUSTODIAN OF RITUALS The Constitutions provide that the Secretary of Scottish Rite Bodies is the custodian of rituals under the direction and supervision of the Presiding Officers. He is entitled to prompt of~cer cooperation in checking ritual files and locating missing rituals. It is essential that one complete set of rituals be kept on file in the office of the Secretary at all times. A signed receipt should be given to the Secretary for eveiy Ritual, Book of Ceremonials, or Officers’ Manual or Constitu - tions. If the person who originally “signed for” a iitual, etc., passes it on to someone else, the Secretary should be notified promptly and a new receipt signed; otherwise the original signer will be held accountable. INNOVATIONS IN RITUAL From the Constitutions: “Subordinate bodies are prohib - ited from conferring degrees except in conformity with the rituals authorized by the Supreme Council.” “The Deputy for the District may suspend from office any officer of a subordinate body who shall use, or cause to be used, any unauthorized ritual of any degree of the Rite.” These Constitutional provisions define the responsibility of oflkers for guarding against unauthorized innovations in ritual. Liberty is granted to Valleys to adapt suggested settings, costumes and dramatic action to local conditions but innovations in the ritual text or changes in sequence are not permitted. V INTEGRITY OF RITUAL SThUCTURE This is of vital significance because the philosophy of the Scottish Rite, its historic message and its practical lessons are dramatized in its Rituals. It is the duty of the Oflicers to guarantee the integrity of the ritual structure by guaxding it from unauthorized changes. All Officers must, therefore, know the rituals for which they are morally and legally responsible. A IRITUAL PROGRAM There are 29 Scottish Rite Degrees, 40320 inclusive, to be conferred. The number of Degrees witnessed by each Class becomes a matter oF importance. Ritualistic programs should be studied with care so that a maximum number oF Degrees may be used. MINOR PROBLEMS (1) The problem of the ritualist who monopolizes a certain part even when advancing age interferes with his effectiveness. (2) The failure to enlist new personnel for degree casts which limits dramatic work to a few. Oflcers can overcome these diflculties by the appointment of an advisory Casting Committee, cooperating with the Officers which — without regard to precedent or favoritism — will fit the man to the part and the part to the man and by the use of Alternate Casts. — 18—"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"7 - 20 A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS RITUAL REVISION This is the function of the Supreme Council through its Committee on Rituals and Ritualistic Matter. Revision is now based upon the findings of scientific and coordinated Ritual Research which conserves the tradition of each Degree, deletes time-wasting repetitions, anachronisms (when possible), and dramatizes the basic message of the Degree. The Committee welcomes suggestions from anyone who is interested in a more convincing ritual and a more impressive exemplification. These suggestions must be sent to the Chairman of the Committee on Rituals and Ritualistic Matter through the Deputy for the District. REGALIA Consult the section on Regalia in the Constitutions and Regulations of the Supreme Council for information con - cerning the Scottish Rite emblem, jewels, chain collars, caps and Consistory uniform. Costumes, properties and stage settings are specified — in general terms — in the ritual of each Degree.

Officers are permitted to retain the old Manual and are urged to read the interpretation of each Degree for their own enlighten - ment. The message — or philosophy — of each Body of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite is all that Candidates need to know. Presiding Officers will urge the members of a given Class to return, from time to time, to witness the exempli - fication of degrees which they have not seen. The following brief statements read by the Presiding Officer, or someone deputized by him, meet the mandatory requirement for “Communication.” —25—"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS 26 COMMUNICATION OF DEGREES LODGE OF PERFECTION The Ineffable Degrees, from the Fourth to the Fourteenth inclusive, are conferred in a Lodge of Perfection. They are called “Ineffable” because they are concerned with the ineffable or unutterable Name of God and with man’s eager quest for the true Name. In these eleven degrees there is a profound unveiling of the character and purposes of God — “that high and holy One who inhabiteth eternity but dwells with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.” In formal ritual and in drama, ten of these degrees, based upon legends of the Solomonic era, elaborate the teachings of Symbolic Freemasonry and apply them to practical situa - tions which are faced in everyday life. The Fourteenth Degree summarizes what has been taught and is a moral and philosophical climax. Important practical lessons are taught in the eleven Inef - fable Degrees: — Secrecy and silence in all confidential rela - tionships; Respect for a Brother’s memory; The duty of healing dissensions; Justice and Mercy in judging others, Fair dealing in business by Management and Labor; The peril of excessive zeal even in a good cause; The honest collection of taxes based upon a just assessment; The mastery of difficulties and dangers in our progress toward Perfection; The honor of Freemasonry is in the keeping of those who seek Perfection in character and who reverence the Ineffable Name of God. 27 COUNCIL OF PRINCES OF JERUSALEM The two Historical Degrees conferred in a Council of Princes of Jerusalem cover the period From B.C. 538 to B.C. 516. They deal with persons and events connected with the end of the Babylonian Captivity of Israel, the return of some of the captives to Jerusalem and the rebuild - ing of the Temple. In the Fifteenth Degree, KNIGHT OF THE EAST OR SwORD, Zerubbabel, a Jewish captive, wins the favor of King Cyrus and the release of the Jews from captivity. Years later, in the Sixteenth Degree, PRINCE OF JERUSALEM, Zerubbabel, returns to Babylon to plead with King Darius for military protection against the enemies of Israel and for more generous assistance in the rebuilding of the Temple. His skill in debate and his courage and integrity inspire Darius to grant his petitions. These degrees, dramatically portrayed, teach loyalty to Conviction in the face of temptation, fidelity to Duty in spitc of hardships, and a devotion to Truth which is mighty above all things and which ultimately must prevail in the councils of mankind."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"28 A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS COMMUNICATION OF DEGREES 29 CHAPTER OF ROSE CROIX The Chapter of Rose Croix — the spiritual center of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite — confers two Philosophical Degrees. The historical setting of these degrees is within the Christian era but without any prescribed date. Their mes- sage is universal; their fellowship may include all worshipers of the One God whatever their nation, race or creed. The Seventeenth Degree — KNIGHT OF THE EAST AND WEST — dramatizes the age-long search for the Lost Word only to find that it is concealed in a Closed Book, sealed with seven seals. No man is worthy to open the Book until he discovers the New Law. The degree inspires the hope that Truth will dawn at last and that the worship of the One true and living God will spread from East to West. In the Eighteenth Degree — KNIGHT OF THE ROSE CROIX oF HERODOM — a Knight of the East and West learns that by the aid of three guiding virtues, Faith, Hope and Charity, he may discover the New Law of Love. The Closed Book is opened and the Word is found. Jesus of Nazareth is revealed as the Exemplar of the Degree and the Cross becomes a symbol of self-sacrifice for all men. The Rose on the Cross typifies the beauty and glory of the New Law incarnate in the lives of men. The degree is deeply religious without any sectarian bias. CONSISTORY OF SUBLIME PRINCES OF THE ROYAL SECRET Fourteen “Traditional”’ and “Chivalric” Degrees — from the Nineteenth to the Thirty-second inclusive — are con - ferred in a Consistory of Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret. Each Degree dramatizes its own unique and independent message and applies it to a familiar life situation. In the area of morals, certain Consistory Degrees teach the ultimate victory of Good over Evil, the dignity of Labor, the sacredness of Duty and unselfish service as the test of one’s religious professions. A leader of men is taught that he must be righteous if he aspires to influence others and that he should listen, with open mind, to the lessons of the ages. In social relations, the Consistory teaches that Toleration is respect for the opinions and religious convictions of others; that he who judges others must himself be above reproach; that it is more noble to forgive than to seek revenge and that a Freemason who commits a felonious crime is not protected by his brethren. In the area of national affairs, the Consistory holds Firmly to the separation of Church and State and teaches that Treason is a crime over which Freemasonry casts no mantle of charity. It proclaims that the crowning glory, in any human life, is that sacrificial love which impels one to lay down his life for a friend."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES 31 IX THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES Congress, by joint resolution (approved by the President, December 22, 1942) established regulations as to the display and use of the American flag by civilian groups.

Nom: Detailed rules concerning the display of the Flag of the United States will be found in The World Almanac and Book of Facts issued each year. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Pledge to the Flag has developed from the original which was drawn up in August 1892 in the office of the Youth’5 Companion, a popular magazine for young people published by the Perry Mason Co., in Boston, Massachusetts. As revised by Act of Congress in June 1954, the pledge is as follows: “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands; one nation under Cod, indivisible, with liberty and Iustice for all.” iv~ (b) When the flag is passing in parade, or during the cesemony of hoisting or lowering, all persons present should —30—"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"- _ ~ ~—-.,- MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS AUTOGRAPH COLLECTORS X MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS MUSIC IN THE RITE The term “Incidental Music” used in the Scottish Rite means that the music should illuminate or interpret the Degree. It should be fitted tQ the time, place and circum - stances of the Degree. An old Testament theme calls for musical settings of the Psalms, the Prophets or the attributes of Cod within that historical framework. A scene in the Christian era allows more liberty of choice but hymns, solos and anthems should not be ultra-theological or sectarian. The Scottish Rite is universal in its scope. Christians (Protestant and Catholic), Jews, Moslems, Parsees and dev - otees of other monotheistic Faiths may meet at the Altar. Music in the Scottish Rite should be universal, free from dogma, sectarian phrases and anything which is controversial. It is recommended that the musical program be selected in a conference which should include Officers of the Scottish Rite Bodies, Director of Work, Organist and Choirmaster. WHAT IS THE ..? This symbol is called “the three dots,” “triangular period” or, more accurately, “triple period.” It came into use prior to the year 1800. It is shaped like a delta, a symbol of the Scottish Rite, and is used after abbreviations which belong to the Rite —as A..A..S..R.. and Ill.~. for Illustrious. j~I Interested and enthusiastic brethren collecting autographs for their Patent or “Passport” often interrupt distinguished guests at the banquet table or while engaged in conversation. Officers are urged to announce, in official notices and at reunions, that all members interested in securing autographs should leave their Patents in the office of the Secretary where they will be signed and may be called for later. COURTESIES When a guest-speaker is invited to visit a Valley, the Committee in charge should advise him that transportation expense and local entertainment will be provided and that an honorarium of $ has been authorized. Specific arrangements concerning time, place, dress and approximate time allotted for the address are always appreciated by the guest. Travel expense incurred by the Sovereign Grand Com - mander, the Deputy for the District, or an Active Membei authorized to represent the Sovereign Grand Commander, is provided for by the Supreme Council. No honorarium. Adequate hotel accommodations — a suite if possible — should be charged to the Valley. BINGS The only official Ceremonial rings are those of the Fourteenth and Thirty-third Degrees. These should be worn with the apex of the triangle toward the finger tips. 4 33 — 32—"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"34 A MANUAl FOR OFFICERS MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS TITLES: CORRESPONDENCE The trend in the Supreme Council is toward simplicity. By formal action, “Most Puissant” has been deleted from the title of the Sovereign Grand Commander and “Puissant” from the title of the Grand Lieutenant Commandes. The title “Ill~” or “Illustrious Brother” and the ~ are intramural, significant only within the Scottish Rite fellow - ship. They should not be used in addressing an envelope. With the exceptions noted below, do not add any official title or any reference to the Supreme Council, 33o~ Address as in ordinary correspondence. In correspondence with the two executives of the Supreme Council, it is permissible to add Sovereign Grand Com - mander or Grand Secretary General on the envelope. In the heading of a letter one may use this foim: Ill.~. (Title) 330 and address him as My dear Sovereign Grand Commander (Or whatever his title may be) or Illustrious and dear Brother or Dear Brother 35 FUNERAL SERVICE The Supreme Council has not authorized a Formal funeral service, the so-called “Ring Seivice” or the “Salt and Rose” ceremony. There is no official objection to the use of any funeral service approved by the Deputy for the District. THE DOUBLE-HEADED EAGLE The Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash was in use 1000 years before the Exodus from Egypt and more than 2000 years before the building of King Solomon’s Temple. The city of Lagash in Surner in southern Babylonia, between the Tigris and the Euphrates and near the modern Shatra in Iraq, was a center of art, literature, military and political power 5000 years before Christ. The symbol was used by many tribal and national groups and, in 102 B. C., Marius, the Roman Consul, decreed it as the symbol of imperial Rome. Later, the Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire used the double-headed eagle to sym- bolize the universality and unity of the Empire. It was adopted in Germany during the days of conquest and imperial power. This symbol was first used in Freemasonry probably in 1758 by a Masonic body in Paris — the Emperors of the East and West — a precursor of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite. The two heads, one facing East and the other facing West, symbolize the universality of the Scottish Rite. (For a more detailed statement, see Article 1200 in the Constitutions.)"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"36 A MANUAL FOR OFFICERS MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS 37 “DEUS MEUMQUE JUS” This motto of the Thirty-third Degree which is engraved in the ceremonial ring is a Latin translation of the French “Dieu et mon Droit” which means — God and my Right. The legend of its origin is of interest. Richard I, King of England from 1189-1199, was known as Richard Coeur de Lion — the Lion-Heart. He spent less than ten months of his ten year reign in England because of his interest in the Crusades and his war with France. In 1198, Richard be - sieged the city of Gisors in Normandy. He issued to his troops, as a parole or battle-cry the words — “Dieu et mon Droit” because Gisors, captured by Philip Augustus of France, really belonged to England. Richard claimed it as “my Right” since he was fighting for his own. He won a great victory, in memory of which England placed the words “Dieu et mon Droit” on the Royal Arms. MASONIC CALENDAR BLUE LODGE — SYMBOLIC Add 4000 to the Christian era. This is Anno Lucis, the “Year of Light.” Thus the year 1955 would be written Masonically, A.~. L .~. 5955. ROYAL ARCH — CAPITULAR Add 530 to the current year. This is called Anno In - ventionis, the “Year of Discovery” and dates from the build - ing of the Second Temple. Add 1913 years to the vulgar era for “The Order of High Priesthood,” or Anno Benefacio meaning “In the Year of Blessing” — the blessing of Abraham by Melchizedek. ROYAL AND SECRET MASTERS — CRYPTIC Add 1000 to the current year. The term Anna Deposi - tionis — in the “Year of the Deposit” — dates from the com - pletion of Solomon’s Temple. KNIGHTS TEMPLAR — CHIVALRIC Subtract 1118 from the current year to get Anna Ordinis or A .XO .. the year of origin. Add 3760 to the current year — in the style of the Jewish calendar. Anna Mundi or A .~. M .. means “Year of the World.” After September add one year.
