Begin slides Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his fathe r-in-law, the Priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the Angel of the Lord appeared S1 unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. S2 And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said: Moses, Moses! And he said: Here am I. And he said: Draw S3 not nigh hither; put off thy shoes form off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, S4 and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. God said unto Moses: Come now therefor e, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of S5 Israel out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God: Behold, when I come unto t he children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of you fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses: I AM THAT I AM; and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. Moses was faithful to the Divine Command, and thus became the great emancipator, prophet, leader and judge of the children of Is rael. He led his people out of bondage, through the wilderness tot he border of the promised land, where on Nebo’s lonely mountain, his eyes undimmed by age and his natural S6 force unabated, God took him. Joshua became their leader. They enter ed the promised land. Here they becam a great nation. Mighty kings and the world’s greatest prophets and teachers rose among them. As long as they were faithful to God, they prospered, but when the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Royal Arch 7 4/14/2003 children of Israel forgot and forsook God, national ruin came upon them. S7 Zedekiah, the last King of Judah, wa s one and twenty years old when he began his reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah, the prophet, speaking from the mouth of the Lord. And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, and stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel. S8 Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and plluted the House of the Lord, which he had hollowed in Jerusalem. And the Lord God of S9 their fathers sent to them by his messengers; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no remedy. S10 Therefore, he brought upon them the King of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of thei r sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age; he gave them all into his hands. And all the vessels of the House of G od, great and small, and the treasures of the S11 King and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon. My brethren, we now represent descendants of those Most Excellent Masters who were present at the destruction of the Temple by S12 Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, who besieged the city, burned the Hous e of God, destroyed the Holy vessels thereof, and the residue of the people that escaped the sword he carried away as captives to Babylon. Here in Babylon our ancestors died, here in captivity we were born, and the rebuilding of the House of the Lord S13 seems afar off. When Cyrus was King of Persia, he issued a decree sa ying: “the Lord God of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is t here among you of his people? His God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the House of the Lord God of Israel.” Our enemies in Judah and the poverty of our people have prevented the fulfillment of our fondest hope. But the dawn of the great day when a new temple shall arise in Jerusalem S14 is near, for Darius, having ascended the throne, has given commandment that the people be not hindered, and that expenses be paid out of the King’s treasury for the rebuilding of the Temp le. We are needed to assist in the noble and glorious work of rebuilding the city and Temple of our God. S15 Shall we go up? Will you? Will you go up? We will go up and the prophesy of Jeremiah will be fulfilled when he said that “after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you S16 in causing you to return to this place.” And, remembering the symbol of the burning bush, which is to impress upon our minds in the most solemn manner that the words and signs following are of Divine institution, and as such must be sacredly regarded by us and transmitted to our posterity as means by which they may be known and distinguished forever after, let us also remember the words of the Lord which we will give to our brethren in Jerusalem, “I"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Royal Arch 8 4/14/2003 AM hath sent me unto you.” Let us commence our journey from Babylon to Jerusalem. Projector off. Here begins the Journey. Exit with K, add additional C if available, up to nine may be used. All will remove shoes and socks and roll up pants legs. C will be bound together with halter ropes, each placing one hand on the shoulder of the C in front. PS, RAC and M1V will lead. Other Companions may assist as necessary . While C are being prepared, lodge room is set up for the journey . PS Thanks be unto God we are once more without the walls of the wicked and abominable city – Babylon. We have left its domes and spires behind us, and I can just see them glittering in the sunlight over the hills and plains of Chaldea. Our trust is in the Great I AM, and alt hough our journey may be long, tedious and dreary, our path rough, rugged and dangerous, yet we will endeavor to overcome every obstacle, endure every hardship and br ave every danger, to promote the noble and glorious work upon which we have entered. Brethren, here the routes dive rge, one leading through the de sert of Arabia, the other up the Euphrates, and around by the way of Anath, Tadmore and Damascus. The desert may be less frequented by travelers owi ng to its extensive sandy plains, its intense heat and great scarcity of provisi ons and water. The other is much more pleasant, though longer and mountainous. There are hardships and dangers in each, but I think, all things considered the river route is most desirable. Let us pursue it. Moving toward Companions with branches. As C pass, branches are presented near their feet and heads, causing them to step over some and duck under others. The recent inundation of the valley seems to have brought trees or limbs and other obstructions down from the mountains and deposited them directly in across our pathway. There seems to be no choice bu to go over some and under those which have lodged higher. It is a dangerous pass; but our trust is in the Great I AM and if we are careful we will soon be safely through. Be careful, Brethren, Stoop beneath that limb; now over this – now under that – Ah! We are safely past. Move to east of lodge room where artificial grass is set up. Seat the C and provide with water and fruit. We are now on the grassy banks of the ev er-running Euphrates. How beautiful the scenery around us! We will tarry here for a while and rest and refresh ourselves. Sit down Brethren. Here is some cool water from the river and fruit that grew on its fertile banks. Eat and drink while you listen to a portion of Ancient History. On this river was built Babylon, the Chief City of the Chaldees, it was situated on both sides of the Euphrates, being connected, however, by a bridge of wondrous"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Royal Arch 9 4/14/2003 construction. This city, from the splendor and magnific ence of its public edifices and its immense wealth, became the seat of empire, and was the wonder and admiration of all beholders. History, both sacred and profane, info rms us that Cyrus, King of Persia, with his victorious armies, besieged the city, and after having invested it for two years, finally took it by strategy, in this manner. He caused ditches to be dug on either side of the city, into which he turned the waters of the Euphrates, thereby draining the bed of the river dry, through which he marched his victorious armies, and bursting through the tunnels, at midnight the assembled before the gates of the king’s palace; and t hose of the Babylonians who escaped the sword were doomed to captivity. But not having time to dwell further on this interesting portion of Ancient History, arise, Brethren, let us be going. PS, RAC & M1V remove fruit and water and assist K’s to rise and get back in line. PS We have left the river and are traversing the Syrian Desert. We have come to the ruins of Tadmor in the wilderness. It was sit uated in the midst of a vast and arid plain – an oasis – a green spot in the desert. Its high antiquity and almost countless remains of former architectural beauty and sp lendor with which it still abounds, have rendered it the wonder and admiration of all beholders. The city is now waste and desolate and naught awakens the echoes in it s empty courts and ruined palaces save the cry of the jackal and the hyena. For years caravans have stopped at the oasis on their long journeys from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean and from t he mountains of Lebanon to the Red Sea. Two Companions with swords and shields make a loud clanging noise by striking sword on shield, yelling hoarsely as they do so. Stop! What is that I see? Two caravans engaged in combat; let us go around and avoid them. PS speeds up and moves around to the bridge. That was a narrow escape, and it has brought us into an abandoned path. The old bridge over this ravine appears to be unsafe. Stop! Let me examine it. Examines the bridge by lifting one end and letting it fall to make a crashing sound. It is nearly gone, but by care we may cross it. Let us make the attempt. Be careful! The bridge trembles but we will soon be safely over. It seems ready to fall – be careful! Be careful! Ah! We are safely over! K’s are lead over the bridge carefully. Two companions, stationed at either end make the bridge wobble and shake. When last C is across, the bridge collapses . We are now approaching the flourishing city of Damascus. Through the long lapse of centuries it has experienced the various vicissi tudes incident to wars and revolutions; but while cities, kingdoms and empires have ar isen, flourished, fulfilled their destiny and fallen, this venerable city still survives – her towers still pointing heavenward. Now we journey toward the south. To t he right we may see the Lebanon forest, where our fathers felled and prepared timbers for the first Temple."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Royal Arch 10 4/14/2003 We are now on the plains of the Jordan and will soon be in sight of the river itself. We are weary, and although borne up by the near ness of our journey’s end, we feel almost overwhelmed and desolate, lest the enemies and robbers of this infested route should, at the last, cut off all hope of final success. Stops to instruct K. Here is the ford through the Jordan leadi ng to Jericho that fell before Joshua’s conquering hosts. Come; let us attempt the passage. Now we enter the Jordan. Its waters are not cold, but yonder banks seems to be covered with rough stones and rocks, so be careful! K’s are lead into the river and across, closely watched by attending companions. Brethren, be careful! We are at last sa fely over and soon will be near to our beloved Jerusalem. Rough and rugged has been the road, long and to ilsome the march, but sustained and favored by the Great I AM, we are at last near our journey’s end. You will remain here in this vale, while I ascend yon eminence. Remove blindfolds. Last Slide As I live, I behold the city of our Fathers. “Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem: If I forge Thee, let my right hand forget its cunning”. Song Jerusalem. K’s are removed to preparation room where their shoes and socks are returned. They are allowed to view the rough and rugged road.

The original Ark of the Covenant, built by Moses, Aholiab, and Bezaleel, disappeared when the Temple was destroyed. As the Ark of the Covenant was the symbol of the Divine Presence with, and protection of, the Jewish people, and a pledge of the stability of their nation, as long as they obeyed the commands of God, so is this copy of the Ark a symbol of God’s presence with us as long as we live in conformity to the precepts contained in the Book of the Law.

HP An explanation of the Key by means of which we were enabled to read the characters on the box will be given to you by Companion A.B. Key Tradition informs us there was a secret vault under the Temple in which our three ancient Masters met and deposited many treasures belonging to the Craft. It was closed after the death of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff and in time its location was forgotten until discovered by three brethren from the Babylonian captivity during the building of the second Temple. You have represented then today and you hav e also rediscovered the vault and again brought to light the tr easures therein concealed. The characters in this alphabet can be made with two squares and a mallet. The Key shows the characters arranged in alphabetical order. There are thirteen characters with dots and thirteen without dot s. The dots represent the use of the mallet to indicate that the characters bel ong to the last half of the alphabet. The Key is read from left to right. The Master’s Word is composed of four Hebrew Characters, corresponding in our language to JHVH, and cannot be pronounced without the aid of vowels which are supplied by the Key or covering wo rds which are found on the sides of the triangle in the characters of the Royal Arch key. The Hebrew characters JHVH are in the c enter of the triangle and are read from right to left. As Hebrew is read from right to left, the characters on the sides of the triangle will be read in that manner in searching for the vowels which enable us to pronounce the Word. Applying the Key we find on this side B .., containing the vowel “ “; on this side O .., containing the vowel “ “; on this side J ... containing the vowel “ “. Placing these vowels in order between the Hebrew charac ters in the center of the triangle we are enabled to pronounce the Master’s Word, the name the Jews were not permitted to pronounce. The key or covering words, when combined form a word of three syllables, which has become the Grand Royal Arch Word. As these words, when so combined, form the Grand Royal Arch Word, written in the Royal Arch key, they are read from left to right. You have solemnly sworn that you will not communicate either of these words, except in the presence of three, by thr ee times three, under a living arch and over a triangle, also that you will not unlawfully make, reveal or retain the key to the mysterious characters of this degree and will destroy it immediately after using it. Complying with this obligation this will now be destroyed."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Royal Arch 26 4/14/2003 HP The step, due guard and sign, and the work ing tools of this degree will now be explained to you by ... Tools I will now explain to you the step, due guard and sign of a Royal Arch Mason. You were taught to advance one step with your le ft foot, bringing the heel of the right to the heel of the left, forming an angle of a square. The due guard and sign of a Royal Arch Mason are given by placing the right hand against the forehead, palm downward, then drawing across the forehead and dropping your hand to your side. It alludes to the penalty of the obligation, where reference is made to having your skull smote off. The working tools of this degree are the Crow, the Pickaxe, and the Spade. The Crow is used by operative Masons to rais e things of great weight and bulk; the Pickaxe to loosen the soil, and prepare it for digging; and the Spade to remove rubbish. But the Royal Arch Mason is emblem atically taught to use them for more noble purposes. By then he is reminded that it is his sacred duty to lift from his mind the heavy weight of passions and pr ejudices which encumber his progress toward virtue, loosening the hold which long habits of sin and folly may have had upon his disposition, and removing the rubbish of vice and ignorance, which prevents him from beholding that eter nal foundation of truth and wisdom upon which he is to erect the spiritual and moral temple of his second life. In addition to the Crow, Pickaxe and Spade, are the Square and Compass, which have been presented to your view in every degree of Freemasonry through which you have passed. The Square teaches us as Royal Arch Masons that God has made all things square, upright and perfect. The Compass is used by operative Masons to describe circles, every part of which is equally near and equally distant from the center. The Circle is, therefore a striking emblem of the relation in whic h the creature stands to his Creator. As every part of the circumference of a circ le is equally near and equally distant from its center, so is every creature whom God has made, to Him equally near and equally distant. The equilateral or perfect Triangle is an emblem of the three essential attributes of Deity, namely Omnipresence, Om niscience and Omnipotence; and as the three equal sides or equal angles form but one triangle, so these three equal attributes constitute but one GOD. Excellent High Priest, the duty is performed. HP The Apron of this degree will be presented to you by ...

HP The Historical Lecture will be presented by Lec My Companions, having passed through the ceremonies of this degree, may we express the hope that it is not an idle or vain curiosity that merely grasps at novelty which has induced you to receive this sublime degree of Freemasonry, far more important than all which have prec eded it. It is calculated to impress upon our minds a firm belief in the Being and existence of God, it teaches a due reverence for His Great and Holy name. It al so brings to light some of the most important secrets of the Craft which lay buried in darkness from the death of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff to the erec tion of the second Temple, and without which the Masonic character is not complete. The degree of the Royal Arch is founded upon the destruction of the first and the building of the second Temple. The ceremonies of this degree have an in teresting and graphic historical setting, and a profound and reverential moral significa nce. The Royal Arch degree is the complement of the Master Mason degree, the unfolding into a second volume the history of that which was lost to its fi nal recover. Without the Royal Arch, the Master mason degree is like a song half sung, a tale partly told, or a promise unfulfilled. The history of the 418 years from the co mpletion of the first Temple to its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar is filled with th e glories, the triumphs, the final fall and degradation of the Kingdom of Judah, and the dispersion and loss of the Kingdom of Israel, and their enslavement in Babylon. Forty-eight years after the destruction of the first Temple, in the first year of his reign, Cyrus, King of Persia, issued an edi t granting permission to the captives to return to their own land and to rebuild the Temple of their God. In this degree you represented three of thes e Hebrew captives, who, rejoicing in their newly found freedom, made their to ilsome and weary march over rough and rugged roads from Babylon to Jerusalem, and having proven worthy, were admitted into the presence of the Grand Council as three weary sojourners from Babylonian captivity, who had come hither to assist in the noble and glorious work of rebuilding the city and House of the Lord without the hope of fee or reward.
