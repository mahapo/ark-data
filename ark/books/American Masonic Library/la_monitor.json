Within the last few decades Fiee - masonry has made great progress in this State, and the need for a Monitor especially adapted to Masonic work in Louisiana has become more and more imperative. Such a book is now submitted to the Craft with the aim and hope that it may in some measure meet the needs. Since its beginning in 1921, when the suggestion that a Louisiana Monitor be issued by the Grand Lodge was endorsed by Judge Wynne G. Rogers, then Grand Mastei, this handbook has had a rough and rugged journey, one beset by many dangers. It is hoped, however, that a better work has attained fulfillment than if it had been hastily cumpleted. The method of procedure in this undertaking was first to secure copies of all available monitors from the earliest ever published down to those of the present day, then after careful study to select and combine the best features of all into a manuscript with such additional light as modern research has thrown on the subject at hand. The whole was then jeviewed and approved by the Monitor Committee after many helpful changes had been suggested and adopted in the text. Perfection is not claimed for the book that is being submitted. Errors will come to light in spite of constant vigilance on the part of the writer and the Committee to prevent them, but it is hoped that a good start has been made in the right direction."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w,stichtingargus.nl W.8lichtingargus.nl w.~itichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ~ 1 stichting~gus.n1 stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. ~4ichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.nl w, stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl & Ciedit for whatever success may ever be claimed for this undertaking must in a large measure be awarded to the members of the Monitur Committee and to other brethren who have put the weight of their Position and influence behind it. Of the latter I feel impelled to mention our late lamented Brother Joseph Sinai who, while Grand Master, revived the work and steadfsstl urged its completion. This Monitor will be deemed worth while by those who have labored in its production if even one brother Mason through the perusal of its pages is helped ONWARD and UPWARD. Via Lucis, Baton Rouge, August 2, 1927. G. C. HUCKABY When Is a Man a Mason? When is a man a Mason? When he can look Out over the rivers. the hills, and the tar horizon with a profound sense of his own littleness in rise vast scheme of chines, and yet have faith, hope, and courage— which is the root of every virtue. When he knows that down in his heart every man is ss noble, as vile, as devine, as diabolic, and as lonely as himself, and seeks to know, to furtive, and to love his fellow— man. When he knows how to sympathize ssith men in their sorrows, yea, even in their sins—knowing that eash man fights a hard light against many odds When he has learned how to make friends and to keep them, and shove all how to keep friends with himself. When he loves flowers, can hunt the birds without a tan, and feels the thrill of an old forgotten joy’ when he hears the laugh of a little child. When he can he happy and highminded amid the meaner drudgeries of life. When star-irowned trees, and the glint of sunlight on flowing waters, suhdse him like the thought of one much loved and long de,sd When no voice of distress reaches his ears in vain, and no hand seeks his aid without response When he finds toad in every faith that helps any man to lay hold of Divine things, and sees majestic meanings in life, whatever the name of that faith may he. When he can look into a wayside puddle and see something beyond mud, and into the face of the most forloin fellow mortal and see something beyond sin. When he knows how to pray, how to love, how to hope. When he has kept faith with himself, with his fellowman, with his God; in his hand a sword for evil, in his heart a hit of a song—glad to live, but not afraid to diet Such a man has found the only real secret of Masonry, and the one wlsisls it is cryisse ta give to all the world — Jaseph Fort Newton. ‘The Builders"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus .nl w.Slichtingargus.nl wddlchtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.~1ichti ngargus.nl w.~tichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl Order of Business 1.

OPENING AND CLOSING CEREMONIES OPENING THE LODGE Ceremony, an act or series of acts in formal and digni - fled procedure, oftentimes symbolical, impressive, and profound, had its origin in the very beginning of human society. In the Ancient Mystesies (those sacred rites which have furnished so many models for Masonic Symbolism), the opening ceremonies were of the most solemn character. The sacred heiald in the Ancient Mysteries commenced the ceremonies of opening the greater initiations by this solemn formula: “Depart hence, Ye Profane,” and added a proclamation against any activity or the use of any language which might be deemed of unfavorable augury to the approaching rites. In like manner a Lodge of Masons is opened with the employment of certain ceremonies in which every member present should take part and give marked attention to their symbolic as well as their practical import. A~ the brethren arrive, the Tyler should require each one to register, the officers coming first in order of their rank. The register should show the date, and state if the communication is to be regular or special. Visitors should register in a special column and each should give the name, number, and location of his home lodge and his rank if he is an officer. The Tyler should then present each brother with a clean apron and the officers with their respective jewels. The Tyler should take special care to see that there is always on hand an adequate supply of fresh, clean aprons. The hour for opening the Lodge having arrived, the Worshipful Master should promptly take his station in the East, give one stroke with the gavel, and proceed with the usual preliminaries. The Lodge should always be opened exactly at the appointed hour."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. sfichtingargus.nl w,sti chtingargus.nl wajtichtingargus.nl w• siichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl 14 Opening and Closing Ceremonies After the door is first tyled, the Tyler should admit no one until opening ceremony iE concluded. After the Lo,dge is opened, no one should be admitted or allowed to depart except by special order of the Worshipful Master. Vsiting brethren who are not vouched for must prove themselves after having first taken the test Oath. Also, a receipt for dues for the current year must be presented for examination. (See page 255, “Reception of Visitors.”) The Lodge is opened on (not in) the Third or Master Mason degree except that it may be opened on the Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft to confer these degrees on candidates previously elected, provided that no other business be transacted. All business is transacted in the MaEter Mason degree except the examination of candidates in the degree to which they have attained, the Initiating or Passing of a candidate into the mysteries of the Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft degree, and Trials in the same degrees. A quorum shall at all times consist of not less than seven members present of the same Lodge. Any brother desiring to discuss a question before the Lodge in session must first rise, salute and address the Worshipful Master, and obtain his recognition. —0 OPENING PRAYER Most holy and glorious Lord God, the Great Architect of the Universe, the Giver of all good gifts and graces, Thou hast promised that where two or three are gathered together in Thy name, Thuu wilt be in their midst and bless them.

The Internal qualifications of a candidate are those which lie within his own bosom, and are not known to the world. They refer to his peculiar disposition toward the Institution, his motives and design in seeking an entrance into it, and his attitude towards Deity. Hence they are known to himself alone; and a knowledge of them can be acquired only from his own solemn declar - ations. The Internal qualifications required of every candidate are as follows: He must come of his own free will and accord, uninfluenced by mercenary purposes. He must believe in the existence of a Supreme Being. The External qualifications are those which refer to the outward fitness of the candidate for initiation. The person who desires to be a Freemason must be a man, at least twenty-one years of age, of sound mind and body. He must be of good moral character, temperate and industrious, capable of reading and writing, and of earning an honcst livelihood. —0 PREPARATION ROOM First impressions are supremely important. The Wor - shipful Master should thoroughly know this degree and do his best work in impressing the candidate with the beauty and sacredness of Freemasonry on this, his first vision of Light. No jesting or frivolous conversation should occur in the preparation. All that is said and done & Entered Apprentice 17 should impress the candidate with the seriousness of the step he is about to take. In the ante-room before preparation, every can - didate should be required to answer affirmatively (with the possible exception of No. 2) the follow - ing questions propounded to him by the Worship - ful Master: 1. Do you believe in the existence of one supreme and everlasting God? 2. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you have not heretofore applied to, or been rejected by a lodge of Free and Accepted Masons? 3. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that, unbiased by the improper solicitation of friends and uninfluenced by mercenary motives, you freely and voluntarily offer yourself as a candidate for the mysteries of Freemasonry? 4. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you are prompted to solicit the privileges of Freemasonry by a favorable opinion conceived of the Institution, a desire for knowledge, and a sin - cere wish to be of service to your fellow creatures?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nL w. st ichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.fll w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingarguS.fll w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w, sti chtingargus.nl w,stlchtingargus.nl w,stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.faichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl 18 Entered Apprentice 5. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you wtll cheerfully comply with all the ancient usages and established customs of the Fraternity? LECTURE IN PREPARATION ROOM The following lecture should be given in the prepar - ation room by the Worshipful Master. Freemasonry is far removed from all that is trivial, selfish, and ungodly. Its structure is built upon the ever - lasting foundation of the Fatherhood of God, the Brother - hood of Man, and the Immortality of the Soul. Our ancient and honorable Fraternity welcomes to its doors and admits to its privileges worthy men of all creeds and religions, but insists that all shall stand upon an ecact equality and receive its instructi6n in a spirit of due humility, emphasizing in demeanor, in conduct, in cere - mony, and in language, the helpless, groping nature of man and his need of reliance upon Divine Guidance through all the activities of life Before we proceed further 1 it becomes my duty to inform you that the ceremonies in which you are about to engage are by no means of a light or trifling character, but are of profound significance and deep solemnity. As a preparation for the mystic rites into which you are about to enter, you will now be asked to divest your mind and conscience of all the personal incentives and super - fluities of worldly life, and to remember that selfish aims and petty social distinctions are not in keeping with the Entered Apprentice 19 humble, reverential, and suppliant attitude of the True Seeker of Divine Wisdom. Freemasonry is a beautiful and profound system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. The design of the Masonic Insti - tution is to make its members wiser, better, and conse - quently happier. This is accomplished by means of a sesies of moral instructions taught, according to ancient usage, by types, symbols, allegorical figures, and lectures. The forms and ceremonies of this Institution have come down through a succession of ages and are all designed to impress upon the mind significant and solemn truths. The preparation to which you must submit before enter - ing the Lodge serves allegorically to teach you that it is the man alone, divested of all the outward recommend - ations of rank, St ate, or riches, that Masonry accepts, and that it is spiritual and moral worth alone which can open for you the door of the Masonic Temple. I will now leave you in the hands of true and trusted brethren, who will see that you proceed as all others have done who have gone this way before. 0 FIRST SECTION RECEPTION 44 Let no man enter upon any great or important under - taking without first invoking the aid of Deity."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w, stichtingargus.nl w,stkhti ngargus.nl w.~tichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. s(ichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl 20 Entered Apprentice PRAYER Vouchsafe Thine aid, Almighty Father of the Universe, to tl 3 is our present convention; and grant that this candidate for Masonry may dedicate and devote his life to Thy service, and become a true and faithful brother among us. Endue him with a sufficiency of Thy divine wisdom, that by the influence of the pure principles of our Art he may be better enabled to display the Beauties of holiness, to the honor of Thy holy name. Amen. Response—So mote it be. The trust of a Mason is in God, as a basis which can never fail and a rock which can never he shaken. Nor is this belief a mere empty profession; for it is borne out and exemplified by our practice. We open and close our Lodges with prayer; the same formula is used at the initiation of candidates; and no business of any impor - tance is transacted without invoking Divine assistance on our labors. For the blessing of God cannot be expected to follow any man’s profession unless it be verified by a good and virtuous life. r Entered Apprentice 21 CIRCUMAMBULATION From age to age, through countless generations) these rites have taught their sublime lessons of wisdom, hope, peace, and warning to the “Sons of Light.” The same lessons, in the same language, are taught us today. This symbolic journey is also emblematical of the pilgrimage of life, which man soon discovers is often dark and gloomy, surrounded by sorrow, fear, and doubt.

However they may differ in creed or theology, all good men are agreed that within the covers of the Holy Bible are found those principles of morality which lay the foundation upon which to build a righteous life. Freemasonry therefore opens this Book upon its altars, with the command to each of its votaries that he diligently study therein to learn the way to ever - lasting life. Adopting no particular creed, fos bidding all sectarian discussion within its Lodge rooms, encouraging each to be steadfast in the faith of his acceptance, Free - masonry takes all its candidates by the hand and, leading them to its altars, points to the open Bible thereon, and urges upon each that he faithfully direct his steps through life by the Light he there shall find, and as he there shall find it. If from our sacred altars the irresponsible autocrat should ever be able to wrest this Book of Sacred Laws, and ihus remove, or even obscure, the greatest Light of Masonry—that light which has for centuries been the role and guide of all Freemasons—then could we no longer claim for ourselves the proud rank and title of Free and Accepted Masons; but, so long as that sacred Light shines upon our altars, so long as it illuminates the pathway of the Craftsmen by the golden rays of Truth, so long will Freemasonry live and shed its beneficent influence upon manldod Guard then, my brother, that Book of sacred and immutable law as you guard your life.

It is the Great Light of Masonry which unfolds the beauties of God’s Eternal rruth. On it rests our mystic Ladder which rises from earth to Heaven, teaching us that by faith in the Great Architect of the Universe we may confidently hope to become partakers of the promises therein recorded. It also teaches that the Divine Charity which has been extended to us should, by Masons, be extended to all mankind. It constantly reminds us of the, duty we owe to God, our neighbor, and ourselves. Wis - dom, strength, and beauty are in its pages. The tenets of our profession—Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth—are taught therein. Take, then, my brother, this sacred Volume, the symbol of our ancient Craft, and make it the rule and guide of your life and conduct. It is the one Volume which has lived in the hearts of the people, moulding and shaping their destinies; and it leads the way to Him who is the Light of the world.

And when at last your weary feet shall have come to the end of life’s toilsome journey and from your nerveless grasp shall drop forever the working tools of life, may the record of your life and conduct be as pure and spotless as this fair emblem which I place in your hands. And when your trembling soul shall stand naked and alone before the Great White Throne, there to receive judgment for the deeds done while here in the body, may it be your por - tion to hear from Him who sitteth as Judge Supreme the welcome words: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” My brother, let this lesson sink deeply into your heart: You should never put on this badge and enter a Lodge in which there is a brother with whom you are at vari - ance or against whom you entertain animosity. Should you find yourself about en take such a step, it becomes your duty to ask the brother to withdraw in order that you may amicably settle your differences. When this is happily effected, you may then clothe yourselves, enter the Lodge, and work with that love and harmony which should at all times characterize Freemasons. But if unfortunately your differences are of such a nature as not to be so easily adjusted, it were better that one or both of you retire than that the harmony of the Lodge be disturbed by your presence. The following may also be used: My brother, I have the pleasure of presenting you with a Lambskin or White Leather Apron. It is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason; and from a time when the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, this emblem, plain and unadorned, has been the peculiar clothing of all Free and Accepted Masons. The Citizen toiling in humble poverty, and the Statesman command - ing the resources of a Nation have alike worn it with the Entered Apprentice 27 consciousness that it has lightened the labor of the one, and added dignity to the powers of the other. It may be that you will be so firmly entrenched in the hearts of your fellowmen and so deserving of their gi aticude that they will elevate you to the highest posi - tion of honor, trust, and emolument, and cause your name to be inscribed high on the pillars of worldly fame. But never have you had, and never again, my brother, will you have, a higher mark of honor and confidence be - stowed on you than this, which I, as the representative of these brethren and of the Craft throughout the world, am about en bestow. This emblem which has been worn by kings, princes, and potentates, which was invested with additional dig - nity by the illustrious Washington, and which has been eagerly sought and worthily worn by the best men of our generation, I now present to you. If you disgrace it, the disgrace will be augmented by the consciousness that within this Lodge you have been taught the principles of a correct and moral deportment. Its spotless white is emblematical of purity of life and uprightness of personal manhood which, we hope, and we have every right to expect, will hereafter distinguish you in all your social and personal affairs. When you become a Master Mason, it will be yours to wear so long as the vital spark shall animate your mortal frame, and when at last, whether in youth, manhood or age, your spirit has winged its flight to that house not made wmth hands, and when amid the tears and sorrow of surviving relatives and friends, and by the hands of sympathizing brother Masons your body shall be lowered to the con - fines of the narrow house appointed for all living, this emblem will still be yours, yours to be placed within the casket which shall enclose your mortal remains, and with them laid beneath the clods of the valley. And may you so wear this emblem of spotless white my brother, that no act of yours shall stain its purity or cast reflections upon an institution which has outlived the fortunes of kings and the mutations of empires.

The Twenty-four-inch Gauge is an implement used by Operative Masons to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use it for the more noble and glori - ous purpose of dividing our time. It, being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught Entered Apprentice 29 to divide into three equal parts; whereby are found eight hours for the service of God and a distressed, worthy brother, eight for our usual vocations, and eight for refreshment and sleep. The Common Gavel is an implement used by Operative Masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use. But we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life; thereby fitting us as living stones for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 0 DEMAND • * * 0 LEssoI~ OF CHARITY * 55 * REINVEST ED * 55 *"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w, sti chtingargus .nl w,stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w . stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl I, F 30 N Entered A pprentice NORTHEAST CORNER 55 * 55 CAUTION 55 55 * 0 SECOND SECTION WORSHIPFUL MAsTRR—Masonry, according to the gen - eral acceptation of the term, is an Art founded on the principles of Geometry, and directed to the service and convenience of mankind. But Freemasonry, embracing a wider range, and having a nobler object in view, namely, the cultivation and improvement of the human mind may, with more propriety, be called a Science~ inasmuch as, availing itself of the terms of the former, it inculcates the principles of the purest morality, though its lessons are for the most part veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. To draw aside this veil, therefore, or more properly speaking, to probe beyond it, is the object of instructors in Fseemasonry; and by a careful and ap - propriate attention to them we may hope, ultimately, to become acquainted with all its mysteries. The lecture of the Entered Apprentice degree is divided into three sections. Throughout the whole, virtue is painted in the most beautiful colors, and the duties of morality are everywhere strictly enforced. The prin - ciples of knowledge are imprinted on the memory by lively and sensible images well calculated to influence our conduct in the proper discharge of the duties of social life, The mode of Masonic instruction is cat - echetical: that is, by questions and answers. The first section of the lecture pertaining to the E. A. degree is a recapitulation of the forms and ceremonies through which the candidate passes during Initiation. This may be rehearsed in the Lodge by two well informed hrethren for the benefit of every newly made E. A. Mason, as r Entered Apprentice 31 each will be required to commit the same to memory and prove his proficiency by examination in open Lodge before he can proceed to the Fellow Craft degree. The second section of the lecture seeks to give rational explanation to the ceremonies as recapitulated in the first, and each E. A. Mason should be required to read and digest the meaning of the second section while becoming proficient in the first section. Were it not for the second section, the first section might, therefore, appear light or trivial, if not absolutely meaningless; yet it may be said o~ Masonry that behind all its forms, ceremonies, and symbols the true Aspirant to Wisdom can find unfailing treasures of emblematic and mystic loie. Masonry has been defined as a beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. Now, an allegory is a story told to illustrate or convey some truth. Some of the most important truths have been handed down to us through allegories, that being one of the favorite methods the Master used to convey His teachings. It is one of the peculiarities of allegory that its message may not be understood by all men. One must be prepared within his own mind and heart to receive the truth, or else he sees it not. It is only a few of all those who hear who perceive the lesson designed to be taught by allegory. The great majority, having ears to hear, hear not, having eyes to see, see not the beautiful lesson, but hear only a pretty story that interests for a short while and then is lost. But the earnest seeker for truth, he who is duly and truly prepared for its percep - tion, sees beyond the veil of the allegory and perceives the beautiful, simple truth which it conceals from the multilude, but reveals to the chosen few. A symbol is a visible sign of an idea. From the earliest dawn of creation man has realized that there is a Supreme Being, a Creator who is all-powerful. Many were the ancient names He bore. As the sun was the most powerful, most awe-inspiring object visible to prim - itive peoples, they used it as a symbol of the Supreme Being. The majority, seeing no further than the symbol, worshiped the sun itself; but the learned, the wise, the thoughtful, ever regarded the sun as only a manifestation"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w, stichtingargus.nl w.st~chtingargus.n1 w.~tichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.nl W.StiChtingarguS.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl ~ 1 stichting~gus.n1 stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w, stichtingargus .nl waitichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl 4 32 Entered Apprentice of God’s power and saw beyond it to the Great Father over all. So, my brother, Masonry teaches by allegories and symbols; and it is your part to eKtract from them the truths that will be of service to you in the building of an upright Masonic character. If you perceive only the stories that Masonry presents to you and do not see deeper into what they are designed to teach, you will miss the most inspiring aspect of Masonry; yet you may comfort yourself with the thought that by far the great majority of Masons are no wiser than yourself. But if, by pondering over the allegories and symbols of these degrees, you find the hidden truth, a new world of wisdom, strength, and beauty will be revealed to you. You have taken an obligation of secrecy, and, my brother, I am constrained to believe that you will ever essentially keep that vow. For, if you elect to remain a member of that greater class of Masons, you will never, outside the essential modes of recognitioq in the nature of grips, passwords, etc., have discovered sufficient of the secrets of Masonry to be enabled to reveal them to others; but, should you by industry and perseverance attain rank among the lesser company, you will have tamed a quality of mind and purpose that will protect those secrets from all except those duly and truly pre - pared, who come in the same manner as you have traveled. In order to understand the symbols of the three degrees, it is necessary for you to know that, broadly speaking, Masonry has come from two general sources. One of these was the societies of stonemasons who flour - ished in medieval times, and who were the builders of those great cathedrals many of which have been so ruthlessly destroyed through the devastations of war. The societies gradually ceased to be bands of operative workers and admitted men not really connected with the actual work of building. By the year 1717 Masonic Lodges had become purely Speculative. But the working tools of the Operative Masons—the square, level, plumb, rule, gavel, etc.—were still retained as symbols -to teach important truths in character-building. We, as Masons, no longer build temples and cathedrals of stone, but we I V Entered Apprentice 33 build spiritual temples: temples of upright character, of virtuous manhood, and of integrity. The second great source from which Masonry derived its symbolism was the ancient mysteries. The relation they hear to our Order will be unfolded to you as you advance in the degrees. Here it is necessary to tell you only that in every ancient nation that attained any degree of civilization were secret organizations known as the Mysteries, having ceremonies of initiation. These or - ganizations were composed of the wisest men of those nations, and all the higher knowledge of religion, art, and science was taught in them alone. Men waited and labored for years to become prepared or worthy to be initiated into the Mysteries. It is related that the great philosopher Pythagoras waited for twenty years to be initiated into the mysteries of Egypt. Moses seems also to have been an Egyptian initiate, while St. John the Baptist came from the Jewish sect called Essenes, which practiced mystical rites. It is even held that the early Christian religion was taught and the Church governed through a system of three degrees, to the highest of which the greater number were never admitted. In the ancient Mysteries of India the candidate might receive the first degree as early as eight years of age. Then began a severe system of mental and moral train - ing to fit him for attainment, for with every degree it was intended that he advance another step toward per - fection. He was invested with a three-ply cord called the Zennar, emblematic of their tri-une God. From that cord we get our cabletow. The candidate was kept a long time in darkness before taking a degree, to reflect upon the seriousness of the step he was about to take. Truly seeking light, he was taught to worship God as the Source of Light. He was conducted regularly about the chamber—usually a cave or cavern hewn out of solid rock—passing from east to west by way of the south, his right hand being next to the altar; the priests chanted, “I copy the example of the sun and follow his benevolent course.” He next made a declaration that he would keep himself pure, that he would be obedient, and would maintain secrecy. After which he was divested of his shoes and clothed in a white linen robe. You see in all"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl 34 these ceremonies the beginnings of some of our Masonic customs; and with these general principles in mind you are ready to hear an explanation of some of the teach - ings of the Entered Apprentice degree. Before initiation, Masonry demands that a candidate be duly and truly prepared. This preparation should be mental and moral as well as physical. Our Order sub - scribes to no system of religious doctrine, but it requires that every man who presents himself as a candidate for initiation shall declare a belief in one God. It teaches that this Supreme Being is all-wise, all beneficent, and that He reveals Himself to mankind. It also teaches that there is life beyond the grave. The candidate must come of his own free will, must be a man, free-born, twenty-one years of age, and his moral qualities must be such as will bear a rigid investigation by a committee of Master Masons appointed for that purpose. Masonry tries to erclude those who come through mere curiosity or through desire for business or social gain. To be a membtr of the investigating com - mietee imposes upon a Mason a most serious duty; for every candidate deserves careful consideration. Never - theless, many truly unprepared make their way into our Lodges. Masonry invites no man. He knocks at the door of the Lodge of his own free will and accord, having divested himself of everything that would indicate poverty or wealth, rank or station. At the inner door of the prepa - ration room all are equal. Entrance through this door into the Lodge room is granted only after the candidate has satisfied all present that he is worthy and well qualified to gain admission, and comes as an earnest seeker for Light and Truth. Gold cannot buy, rank cannot demand, rror can learning guarantee admission, unless a reputation for generosity, truthfulness, and rectitude of conduct be coupled with it. In order to impress these truths more forcibly upon your mind, you were this evening * * You were * * * that you might not bring any - thing offensive or defensive into the Lodge, as the Entered Apprentice 35 l)rinciples of Masonry, forbidding the one, render the othex unnecessary, to imprint upon your mind the peculiarity of the circumstances which occurred at the building of King Solomon’s Temple, inas - much as during the whole time there was not heard the sound of axe, hammer, or any tool of iron. The question naturally arises: How could so stupendous an edifice be erected without the aid of these im - plements? The stones were hewn, squared, and numbered in the quarries where they were pro - cured. The timbers were felled, fitted, and pre - pared in the forests of Lebanon, conveyed to Jeru - salem, and there set up by the aid of wooden mauls and implements prepared for that purpose; so that every part fitted with such exact nicety that it re - semb led the handiwork of the Supreme Architect of the Universe more than that of human hands. As this Temple is a pattern of every regular and well-governed Lodge, let us draw the moral in - ference that our ancient and venerable Institution depends not for its support and permanency on any principle of compulsive or coercive force, but is best cemented by the perfect union and harmony of its constituent parts.

It is a symbol of the agonies of the first death and of the throes of a new birth. There you stood without our portals, on the threshold of this new Masonic life, in darkness, helplessness, and ignorance. After wandering amid the errors and having been covered over with the pollutions of the outer and profane world, you came inquiringly to our doors, seeking the new birth, and asking a withdrawal of the veil which concealed the divine truth from your uninitiated sight. Here, as with Moses at the burning bush, the solemn admonition is given, “Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.” Ceremonial preparations surrounded you, all of a significant character, to indicate to you that some great change was about to take place in your moral and intellectual condi - tron. There was to be not simply a change for the future, but also an extinction of the past; for initiation is, as it were, a death to the world and a resurrection to a new life. And hence it was that among the old Greeks the same word signified both “to die” and “to be initiated.” But death to him who believes in immortality is but a new birth. The world is left behind—the chains of error and rgnorance which had previously restrained you in moral and intellectual captivity are to be broken— the portal of the Temple of a Future Life has been thrown wide open; and Masonry stands before you in all the glory of its form and beauty, to be fully revealed, however, only when the new birth has been completely accomplished. -.4"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.ni w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.s~ichtingargus.nl w.~tichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w . stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl 38 Entered Apprentice You were received * * * the moral of which was explained to you at that time. Secrecy is the first great lesson of the Entered Apprentrce degree. This great virtue is necessary rn our Order so that 1\\lasons will appreciate the lessons taught. As a secret shared between two people binds them together, so the secrets of our Fraternity bind the brethren together. If our teachings of beautiful truths were scattered broad - cast throughout the world, they would become com - monplace; so they are taught under secrecy only to those deemed worthy to receive and practice them. Taken with the salt of curiosity and expectation, they will be more readily perceived. Nothing can torture a man more sorely than the pangs of remorse which a guilty conscience can force upon him. Sharp instruments may torture the flesh, but unless the torture be unto death, a few short days suffice to heal the wounds and only the scars remain to remind one of the agony en - dured. But the torture of a guilty conscience is not so. Memory of pledges violated, evil deeds done, kind actions left undone, comes to us after years have passed; comes to us as we lie upon our beds and chases “sleep, tired Nature’s sweet re - storer,” from our eves, and makes our bed a hell; comes amid our innocent social pleasures and turns our joy to pain. A face, a word, or an odor may bring back the hateful incidents of a scene that no subsequent life of purity and rectitude of conduct can banish from the memory. Brother, guard well your actions, that henceforth no memory Entered Apprentice 39 of evil deeds disturb your peace or rack your mind and conscience. You were * * *, because as Masons we are taught that no man should ever enter upon any great or important undertaking without first in - voking the blessing of Deity. This is because Masonry is a religious institution, and we thereby show our dependence upon and our trust in God. In the light of that lesson, prayer becomes a duty as well as the privilege of every Mason. How lew understand the nature and effects of prayer Prayer that has become merely a bedtime custom is not a prayer; it is an incantation to soothe the demands of a habit formed in more innocent and unsophisti - cated days. The object and the effect of prayer are to bring the soul into conscious harmony with the all-wise Father, whose laws are true and just and righteous altogether. “He who has the fountain of prayer in him will not complain of hazards. Prayer is the recognition of laws, the soul’s exercise and source of strength, its thread of conjunction with them. Prayer for an object is the cajolery of an idol, the resource of superstition. There you misread it. Vie that fight the living world must have the Universal for succor. Cast forth the soul in prayer, you meet the effluence of the outer truth; you join with the creative ele - ments giving breath to you.

The trust of a Mason is in God. But before a man can trust in God, whom he cannot see, he must learn to trust in his fellowman, who is made in God’s image. As you placed yourself in the hands of this Lodge and followed your conductors through the ceremonies of initiation, you exemplified your trust in your fellowman. So ever place your tiust in God and walk uprightly through life, fearing no danger. Know that a man’s worst enemy is himself, and that with one, God is a majority. He who is in conscience bound to perform an act, to accomplish a purpose, or to keep a secret, is bound by ties, though invisible, that are stronger than any bonds that could be forged or contrived by man. The release of the candidate from the last ties that bind him to the world he has left outside the Lodge room, coupled with the reception of light, is a symbol of a new birth, a birth from the r Entered Apprentice 41 darkness of ignorance and superstition to the light of wisdom, toleration, generosity, and all other com - mendable virtues.

Our ancient brethren worshiped Deity under the name of fides, or fidelity, which was sometimes represented by two right hands joined, and sometimes by two human figures holding each other by the right hand. The right hand, therefore, was employed as a token of your sincerity, and as a pledge of our fidelity in the work upon which we were then engaged. You were presented a Lambskin or White Leather Apron. The Lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence. By the lambskin, therefore, the Mason is reminded of that purity of life and conduct essential to gaining admission to the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. Entered Apprentice 45 You were requested to deposit some metallic sub - stance, to teach you a lesson in Charity, and to remind you of your own humble condition, both of property and dress, of penury and want, in which you were received into the Lodge; which lesson should make you at all times sensible of the dis. tresses of poverty. Charity is a distinguishing characteristic of every lVlason. It is in the practice of this virtue that man most reveals his kinship to God. Hear Buddha on the charitable man: “The charitable man is loved by all; his friendship is prized highly; in death his heart is at rest and full of joy, for he suffers not from repentance; he receives the opening flower of his reward and the fruit that ripens from it. The charitable man has found the path of sal - vation. He is like the man who plants a sapling, securing thereby the shade, the flowers, and the fruit in future years. Even so is the result of charity; even so is the joy of him who helps those who are in need of assistance.” If the cardinal virtues of Freemasonry, which are Fortitude, Pru - dence, Temperance, and Justice, were practiced by all mankind, then charity, as an act of almsgiving, would cease. For ignorance and intemperance and injustice would be banished from the world; and the woes of misery and penury that Jollow them would then give place to joy. But the poor we have with us always.

As on this night you com - mence the great task—which is never in your future Masonic life to be discontinued—of erecting in your heart a spiritual temple for the indwelling of God, of which the great Temple at Jerusalem was but the symbol; and as each new duty which you learn and each new virtue that you practice become living stones in that temple—it is proper that you begin the labor of erecting a spiritual temple just as the Operative Mason begins the construction of his Entered Apprentice 47 material temple, by laying the corner-stone on which the edifice is to rise. Your first instruction in this degree constitutes that corner-stone; and when it is laid in its proper place, you will construct on it th~<moral Masonic temple of your life. Thus, my brother, we close the second section of the lecture of this degree. 0 THIRD SECTION The usages and customs among Freemasons have ever borne a close resemblance to those of the ancient Egyp - tians. Their philosophers, unwilling to expose their mysteries to vulgar eyes, couched their systems of learn - ing and polity under signs and hieroglyphical figures which were communicated only to their chief priests or Magi, who wei e hound by solemn oath to conceal them. The system of Pythagoras, as welt as many others of more recent date, was founded on a similar principle. Masonry, however, is not only the most ancient, but one of the most honorable, of all existing societies; and there is not a character nor an emblem here depicted but serves to incutcate the principles of piety and virtue among all its genuine professors. The lecture pertaining to the third section explains the nature and principles of our constitutions, and furnishes many interesting details relating to the form, supports, covering, furniture, ornaments, tights, and jewels of a Lodge; how it should be situated, to whom dedicated, and so forth. * * * -4"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w,stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl 48 Entered Apprentice The Lodge is an assemblage of Masons, duly congregated, having the Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses, and a Warrant of Constitution author - izing them to work. I, Entered Apprentice 49 The Warrant of Constitution is a Charter or Dispensation issued under authority of the Grand Lodge, authorizing the Lodge to meet and per - form Masonic labor. Without such Warrant the Lodge is irregular and clandestine, and regular Masons are forbidden to hold any N’Iasonic com - munication with such Lodge or with the members thereof. Our ancient brethren met on the highest hilts and in the lowest valleys, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, and to guard against sur - prise; also, because these places were esteemed most sacred. Lodge meetings at the present day are usually held in upper chambers—probably for the better security which such places afford. It may be, however, that the custom had its origin in a practice observed by the ancient Jews of building their temples, schools, and synagogues on high hills; a practice which seems to have met with the ap - probation of the Almighty, who said unto the Prophet Ezekiel, “Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy.” Before the erection of temples the celestial bodies were worshiped on hills and the terrestrial ones in valleys. At a later period the Chrstians, wherever it was practicable, erected their churches on eminences. Hills and moun - tains were always considered the peculiar abode of Deity; hence the Masonic tradition that our ancient brethren held their lodges most frequently on the highest hills. * 4* 4* THE FORN4 OF A LODGE is an oblong square.

A LODGE HAS THREE PRINCIPAL SUP - PORTS (represented by columns), which are Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty: Wisdom to con- V Entered Apprentice 51 trive, Strength to support, and Beauty to adorn. Wisdom to conduct us in all our undertakings, Strength to support us under all our difficulties, and Beauty to adorn the inward man. The uni - verse is the temple of the Deity whom we serve. Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty are about His throne as pillars of His works; for His wisdom is infinite, His strength omnipotent, and His beauty shines through the whole of creation. In symmetry and order the heavens He has stretched forth as a canopy; the earth He has planted as His footstool; He crowns His temple with stars, as with a dia - dem; and His hands extend their power and glory. The sun and the moon are messengers ol His will, and all His law is concord. The three great pillars supporting a Mason’s Lodge are emblematic of those divine attributes. Of these, the column of Wisdom is situated in the East part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Master; because it is presumed that he has wisdom to devise labor for the Craft and to superintend them during the hours thereof. The column of Strength is situated in the West part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Senior Warden; because it is his duty to strengthen and support the au - thority of the Master. The column of Beauty is situated in the South part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Junior Warden; because, as the sun in the South at its meridian height is the beauty and glory of the day, so is the Junior Warden in the South.

The Compasses are dedicated to the Craft; for by a due attention to their uses, we are taught to circumscribe our desires and to keep our passions in due bounds. Hence, the Bible is the light which enlightens the path of our duty to God; the Squate, that which enlightens the path of our duty to our fel - [ow ~men; and the Compasses, that which enlightens the path ol our duty to ourselves. * * * Entered Apprentice 55 • ,e e~~e •••,,~ •, 4 ~ iii’’, II. The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pave - ment, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground-floor of King Solomon’s Temple. It also supplies the floor design for many of the great cathedrals of Europe which were constructed by Operative Masonic gu~lds during the Middle Ages. The Mosaic Pavement is, therefore, mystically re - lated to religious philosophy and is emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil. As we tread the various and uncertain paths of life, as our days are variegated and checkered by a strange contialiety of events, and as our passage through this existence, though sometimes attended by prosperous cir - cumstances, i~ often beset by a multitude of evils—there - fore is the Lodge furnished with Mosaic work to remind us of the precariousness of our state on earth.

One of these is in the East, one in the West, and one in the South. There is no light in the North; because King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was placed so far North of the ecliptic that the sun and moon, at their meridian height, could dart no rays into the North - ern part thereof. The North, therefore, we Ma - sonically call a place of darkness. As the sun, apparently, rises in the East to open the day, and dispenses light, life, and nourishment to the whole creation, it is well represented by the Master, who is placed in the East to open the Lodge and impart light, knowledge, and instruction to all under his direction. XVhen it arrives at its greatest altitude in the South, where its beams are most piercing and the coo] shade is most refreshing, it is then appropriately represented by the Junior Warden, who is placed in the South to observe its approach to the meridian, and at the hour of high twelve, or noon, to call the brethren from labor to refreshment. Still pursuing its course to the XVest, the sun at last closes the day and lulls all Nature to repose. It is then fitly represented by the Senior Warden, who is placed in the West to close the Lodge by command of the Master, after having rendered to everyone the just reward of his labor and having enabled him to enjoy that repose which is the genuine fruit of honest industry. * * *"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus .nl w,stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl 58 Entered Apprentice F t~ A A Lodge has SIX JE’iVELS; three immovable and three movable. The immovable Jewels are the Square, the Level, and the Plumb. The Square inculcates morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of con - duct. They are called immovable Jewels because they are always to be found in the East, West, and South parts of the Lodge, being worn by the officers in their respective stations. The movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone, as taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state. By it we are reminded of our own state, rude and imperfect by nature. L r Entered Apprcntzce 59 The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted by the working-tools of the Fellow Craft. It reminds us of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God. Upon the Trestle Board the Master workman draws his designs. By it we are remtnded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal build - ing agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle Board, so should we, both Operative and Speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of Nature and Revela - tion, which are our spiritual, moral, and Masonic Trestle Boards. * * * A LODGE IS SITUATED DUE EAST AND WEST because all places of divine worship, —4"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus . ni w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.sti chtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl 60 Entered Apprentice as well as Masons’ regular, well-formed, and con - stituted Lodges are, or ought to be, so situated. For this we assign several Masonic reasons: first, the sun, the glory of the Lord, apparently rises in the East and sets in the West; second, learning originated in the East and thence spread its benign influence to the West; third, and principally, be - cause King Solomon’s Temple was so situated. Also because, after Moses crossed the Red Sea, pur - sued by Pharaoh and his host, he erected, by divine command, a tabernacle, which he placed due East and West, to receive the first rays of the rising sun, and to commemorate that mighty east wind by which the miraculous deliverance of Israel was effected. This tabernacle is said to have been an exact pattern of King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation and, therefore, is, or ought to be, placed due East and West. 0 DEDICATIONT OF LODGES Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solo - mon, because he is said to have been our first Most Excellent Grand Master; but modern Masons in this country dedicate their Lodges to St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist, who are said to have been two eminent patrons of Masonry. And there is represented in evely regular and well- governed Lodge a certain point within a circle em- bordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, which En iered Appreniice 61 in recent times have come to represent St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist; and upon the top rests the Holy Scriptures. The point represents the individual brother; the circle, the boundary line of his duty beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, interests, or prejudices to betray him. In going around this circle, he necessarily touches upon the two parallel lines, as well as the Holy Scrip - tures; and as long as a Mason keeps himself circum - scribed within these due bounds, it is impossible that he materially err."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl K 62 Entered Apprentice TENETS The three great tenets of a Mason’s profession are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. By the exercise of BROTHER - LY LOVE we regard the whole human species as one family—the high and the low, the rich and the poor—who, created by one Al - mighty Parent and made inhabit - ants of the same planet, are to aid and protect one another. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained forever apart. To RELIEVE the distressed is a duty incumbent upon all men, but particularly upon Masons, who profess to be linked together by an tndissoluble chain of sincere affec - tion, To cheer the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. TRUTH is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is one of the first lessons taught in N4asonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to r Entered Apprentice 63 regulate our conduct. Hence, while we are influ - enced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are un - known among us; and with the heait and tongue we join in promoting one another’s welfare and in rejoicing at one another’s prospelity. Every Mason has four P~ ~*~s E**, which are the P~ P~’ M** and G**, and which are illus - trated by the four Cardinal Virtues: Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice. FORTITUDE is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we undergo any pain or peril when it is pru - dentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cow - \\ ardice, and should be deeply impressed ‘IA upon the mind of every Mason. It is a safeguard or security against the success of any attempt, by force or guile, to ex - tort from him any of those secrets with which he has been so solemnly intrusted and which were em - blematically impressed upon his mind on his first admission into the Lodge, when he was received upon * ** which refers to **** PRUDENCE teaches us to regu - late our lives and actiol-is agreeably to the dictates of reason.

As he comes from the ignorance and darkness of the outer world his first craving is for light. Not that physical tight which springs from the great orb of day as its fountain, but that moral and intellectual light which emanates from the primal source of all things, from the Great Architect of the Universe, the Creator of the sun and of all that it illuminates. Hence the great, the primary, object of the first degree is to symbolize the birth of intellectual light in the mind; and the Entered Apprentice is the type of unregenerate man, groping in moral and mental darkness, and seeking the light which is to guide his steps and point him to the path that leads to duty and to Him who gives to duty its reward. CHARGE AT INITIATION Brother: As you are now introduced to the first principles of Freemasonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honorable Fraternity: ancient, as having existed from time immemorial; and honorable, as tending in every Entered Apprentice 67 particular so to render all men who will be con - formable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better principle or a more solid founda - tion; nor were eve: more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the sev - eral Masonic lectures. The wisest and best men in all ages have been encouragers and promoters of our Art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, to extend its privileges, and to patronize its as - semblies. There are three great duties which as a N4ason you are charged to inculcate: To God, to your neighbor, and to your self. To God, in never mentioning His name save with that reverential awe which is due from the creature to his Creator, in always imploring His aid in all your laudable un - dertakings, and in ever esteeming Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square and doing unto him as you would that he should do unto you. And to your sell, in avoiding all irregularities and intemperance which may impair your faculties or debase the dignity of your pro - fession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the state you are to be a quiet and peaceable citizen, true to your government and just to your country. You are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but to submit patiently to legal authority and to conform with cheerfulness to the government"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus .nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus . ni w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w,stichtingargus.nl w,stiChtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus .nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus .nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stiChtingargus.nl ~ 1 stichting~gus.n1 stiChtingargus .nl stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus .nl W. stiChtiflgarguS.fll w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl 68 Entered Apprentice of the country in which you live, yielding obedience to the laws which afford you protection.

The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations before God and man, squaring our actions by the Square of Virtue, ever remembering that we are traveling upon the Level of Time to that “undiscovered country, from whose bourne no traveler returns.” is is is The symbols of those instruments used by aichitects are unknown to common observers, who see in them simply a square, a level, and a plumb; but Free and Accepted Masons recognize them as emblems of certain moral principles and religious duties which, if followed out as they should be, would render all men valuable members of society. Fellow Craft 73 The Square teaches us to regulate our lives and actions according to Masonic line and rule, and so to harmonize our conduce in this life as to render us accept - able to that Divine Being from whom all goodness springs and to whom ~ve must give an account of all our actions. The Level demonstrates that we are all sprung from the same stock, partake of the same nature, and share the same hope. And although distinctions among men are necessary to preserve subordination, no eminence of sta - tion should make us forget that we are brothers. He who is placed on the lowest spoke of Fortune’s wheel is equally entitled to our I egard; for a time will come, and the best and wisest of us know not how soon, when all distinctions save those of goodness and virtue shall cease, and Death, the grand leveler of all human greatness, shall reduce us to the same estate. The infallible Plumb, which, like Jacob’s ladder, con - nects heaven and earth, is the criterion of rectitude and truth. It teaches us to walk justly and uprightly before God and man, turning neither to the right nor to the left from the strict paths of virtue; not to be an enthusiast, persecutor, slanderer or reviler of religion, bending neither towards avarice, injustice, malice, revenge, nor the envy and contempt of mankind, but giving up every selfish propensity which may have a tendency to injure others. To steer the bark of this life over the rough seas of passion, without quitting the helm of rectitude, is the highest perfection to which human nature can attain; and as the builder raises his column by the aid of the Level and the Plumb, so ought every Mason to conduct himself towards this world. To observe a due medium between avarice and profusion; to bold the scales of justice with equal poise; to make his passions and prejudices coincide with the strict line of his duty; and in all his pursuits to have eternity in view."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"w.StiChtingarguS.nl w.stiChtingarguS.nl w.

So by square conduct, level steps, and upright intentions, we hope to ascend to those blessed mansions whence all goodness emanates. 0 SECOND SECTION Masonry is called a progressive science. Ii may also be defined as a system of morals applicable to life, but veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. For the more regular advancement in the knowledge of its mys - teries it is divided into several classes and degrees. Ac - cording to the progress we make, we limit or extend our inquiries, and in proportion to our capacity therein, we attain to a lesser or a greater degree of perfection. The two sections of this degree form important parts of the great edifice of Masonry. The first, while purely ceremonial, is designed to lead the mind to a proper consideration of its symbols, which have been so wisely selected and are so happily designed to inculcate the great lessons of morality and truth. In this, the second section, your attention will be directed to new and more interesting symbols, and I shall endeavor to give you some idea of their Masonic application. The question is frequently asked, “Why does Masonry teach by symbols ?“ To the student the answer naturally suggests itself. Masonry is the oldest of all existing societies—no art, no science preceded it. When it came into existence letters were unknown, and the records of passing events were carved on stone, engraved in burnt clay, or recorded on other material in the foim of pictorial representations. As the years passed and man’s intellectual powers were developed, written characters or letters came into use, of which today nearly three hundred have been deciphered, while a large number yet remain unknown. But not - withstanding the invention of alphabets, man still clung F Fellow Craft 75 to the pictured ideas, for they were more pleasing and intelligible to the sight. Thus has Masonry retained this most ancient or primitive method of instruction; and by its symbols appealing to the physical sight it seeks to impress upon the heart and mind its great lessons. It is not the ritualistic ceremonies and observances alone that constitute Masonry; they are merely the intro - duction to and the beginning of Masonic life. Yet they are of the highest importance; they are to Masonry what the foundation or substructure is to a building. It mat - ters not how beautiful, stately or superb a building may appear; if the foundation is too narrow or its construc - tion faulty, the building will be defective and its perma - nency doubtful. If the rendition of the ritual is faulty or expressionless, its beauty is marred, and favorable impression upon the novitiate so necessary to translate its symbolic meaning into an intelligible appreciation of its beautiful teachings, may fail of realization. The ritual accurately and impressively rendered may prove a potent factor In inciting higher ideals and in fashioning his life in conformity with the principles expressed or implied in our beautiful symbolism. To you, my brother, the gauge, gavel, square, level, and plumb should no longer be merely the working tools of an Operative Mason’s art, but visible, tangible em - blems of great moral ti uths and duties. You now represent a Fellow Craft Mason on his way to the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple; and it becomes my duty to explain to you the variety of objects which will attract your at - tention as you proceed, and to inform you that Freemasonry is considered under two denominations —Operative and Speculative. We work as Speculative Masons only, but our ancient brethren wrought in both Operative and Speculative Masonry. They worked at the building of King Solomon’s Temple, and many other sacred and important edifices."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"w,StiChtingarguS.nl w.stiChtingarguS.fll w.StiChtingarguS.nl w.StiChtingarguS.nl w.StjChtingarguS.nl w.StiChtingarguS .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.

It furnishes us with dwellings, and with convenient shelter from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wis - dom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is im - planted in man for the best, most salutary, and benef - icent purposes. The Operative Mason directs his labors to the con - struction of material edifices composed of stone, brick, and mortar, which, like all things temporal, must sooner or later succumb to the inevitable ravages of time. By SPECULATIVE MASONRY we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good seport, maintain secrecy, and prac - tice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative Mason to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfec - tions of his divine Creator. The Speculative Mason, therefore, is a moral builder for eternity, fitting immortal nature for that spiritual building which shall exist when earth’s proudest monu - mental piles shall have crumbled into dust, and the glory and greatness of earth shall have been forgotten. “When the vast sun shall veil his golden light Deep in the gloom of everlasting night, When wild, destructive flames shall wrap the skies, When ruin triumphs, and when nature dies; Man, alone, shall the wreck of worlds survive. ‘Mid falling spheres immortal man shall live.” K Fellow Craft 77 This section of the lecture of this degree refers also to the origin of the Jewish Sabbath, as well as to the manner in which it was kept by our ancient biethren. Befoie the Almighty was pleased to command this vast world into existence, the elements and materials of cre - ation lay mixed together without distinction or form. Darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, “Let there be light I” and there was light. And as it pleased God to be six days in commanding order liom chaos, man should reflect that even Deity moves with due deliberation. The Almighty, having finished the six days’ woilr, tested on the seventh. He blest, hallowed, and sanctified it. He thereby taught man to work industriously sic days; but strictly commanded him to rest on the seventh —the better to contemplate the beautiful works of cre - ation, to adore Him as the Creator, to go into His sanctuaries, and to offer up praises for life and every blessing he so amply enioys at His bountiful hands. Osir ancient btethren worked six days and con - secrated the seventh as a day of rest from their labors. It was theit custom to assemble on the eventng of the sixth day of each weelc in the Mid - dle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple, thete to receive their wages as Fellow Crafts. Their way thither led through a long porch or passage of the Temple, at the outer entrance of which were placed two large columns, or PILLARS, which you see here represented, and which you will find in all regular and well- furnished Lodges of Fellow Craft Masons: the one on the left or North, called Boaz, and the other on the right or South, called Jachin (Jack-in)."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stiChtingarguS.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w,stichtingargus.nl w.StiChtingarguS.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.

Josephus, the Jewish historian, has handed down a description of them, and, Mackey’s Lexicon of Free - masonry contains another. All accounts differ in certain respects; and in fact the details are so confused that Masonic authorities are not in accord on any except the chief features, which seem to be as follows: The height Fellow Craft 79 of the pillar itself is given in all the accounts but one as eighteen cubits; and the chapiter which swells out above it is said to have been five cubits in height. But, as it ~ overlapped the top to the extent of half a cubit, the total height was twenty-two and one-half cubits. As the cubit is usually calculated to have been eighteen inches, this gives us the total height of the pillar and its capital as thirty-three feet, nine inches. Its circumference is given as twelve cubits or eighteen feet, which would make its diameter just under six feet. The pillars were hollow, and the thickness of the metal of which they were com - posed is usually supposed to have been three inches; though it has sometimes been given as four. Also, it has been said that there were doors at the back of each pillar, opening into three archives, where books of the Law and other records were kept in safety. It has been supposed that Solomon, in erecting these pillars, had reference to the Pillar of Cloud and the Pillar of Fire which went before the Israelites in the wilderness; and that the right hand, or south pillar, represented the Pillar of Cloud, and the left hand, or north pillar, represented that of Fire. Solomon did not erect them simply as ornaments to the Temple, but as memorials of God’s repeated promises of support to His people of Israel. For the Pillar “Jachin,” derived from the Hebrew words “Jab,” meaning “Jehovah,” and “achin,” “to establish,” signifies that “God will establish His house in Israel ;“ while Ihe Pillar “Boaz,” com - pounded of “b,” meaning “in,” and “oaz,” “strength,” signifies that “in strength shall it be established.” And thus were the Jews, in passing through the porch of the Temple, daily reminded of the promises of God, and inspired with confidence in His protection and gratitude for His many acts of kindness to His chosen people. The Masonic symbolism of these two pillars may be taken as two-fold. First, in reference to the names of the pillars, they are symbols of the Strength and Stability of the Institution; and then in reference to the ancient Pillars of Fire and Cloud, they are symbolic of our de - pendence on God, through all His creations, by which alone are Strength and Stability secured."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"El w.StiChtingarguS.nl w.StjChtingarguS.nl w.StiChtingarguS.nl w.stichtingargus.nl W.

Springing out from the pillar, at the junction of the chapiter with it, was a row of petals of the lotus, the water-lily of the Nile. Just above this and at the beginning of the expanded part of the chapiter (or capital), two rows of pomegranates were carved. Starring at the two rows of pomegranates and extending upward, was a network which covered the greater part of the oval; and superimposed over the network was an artistic arrangement of palm leaves and chains hanging in festoons. All this work, we are told, was executed by H. A., a widow’s son of Naphtali, a skilled worker in metals, who was sent down to Jerusalem by H., K. of T., especially to do this and other metal work for the temple. The Lily, by irs extreme whiteness and the retired situation in which it grows, denotes purity and spiritual enlightenment; the Network, by the intimate connection of its parts, denotes God’s love and blessing pouring down on all His creatures; and the Pomegranates, by the exuberance of their seeds, denote the abundant provisions of Nature. Our ancient brethren interpreted these oval- shaped bodies as representing the Terrestrial and Celestial Spheres, indicating life on earth and the life celestial; but this idea is now conveyed in the representations of those ancient Pillars, by the superaddition of two Globes with their ac - companying markings. On the convex surfaces of these Globes are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth; the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other particulars. Their principal use, besides serving as maps to dis - tinguish the outward parts of the earth and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and explain the phe - nomena arising from the annual revolution of the earth Fellow Craft 81 around the sun and the diurnal rotation of the earth on its own axis. They are the noblest instruments for im - proving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or proposition, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with due reverence for the Deity and His works, and are induced to encourage the studies of Astronomy, Geography, and Navigation, and the arts dependent upon them, by which society has been so much benefited. They also denote the universality of Masonry, and teach us that a Mason’s charity should be equally as extensive. Beyond the pillars you behold a FLIGHT OF XVINDING STAIRS, leading to a place repre - senting the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple. The only allusion to it in Scripture is to be found in the sixth chapter of the First Book of Kings, and is in these words: “The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house; and they went up with wind - ing stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third This Symbolical Stairway, which leads from the ground-floor to the Middle Chamber of our Mystic house, consists of fifteen steps and three divisions. The divisions, we perceive, differ in the number of their steps, each having an odd number—”three, five, and seven.” VYhile there is no positive evi - dence that these divisions have any particular ref - erence to Ancient Craft Masonry, yet the lessons taught us, as we ascend, should impress upon the mind of every Freemason the importance of dis - cipline, as well as knowledge of natural, mathe - matical, and metaphysical science.

This flight of stairs is a grand philosophical legend, whose rugged steps are symbols of stages of instruction; and our laborious ascent symbolizes Our struggles to reach the summit of knowledge, where alone the crafts - man can receive his reward—the Divine Word—the Truth. These three principal divisions symbolize the necessary preparation for our lifework, indicating the grades or divisions of education: nam ely, elementary, preparatory, and collegiate. The first Three Steps allude particularly to the organization of our Institution into three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason; to the three principal officers of the Lodge, the Worshipful Master 1 the Senior and Junior VVardens; to the three principal supports in Ma - sonry, Wisdom, Strength and Beauty; because it ts necessary to have wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all well-regulated institutions. They also allude to the three prin - cipal stages of human life: Youth, Manhood, and Old Age. That Youth, the springtime of life, when the heart puts forth the tender leaves of hope” and gladdens us with its fresh expectancy; Manhood, the summer, when those leaves, matured, load us with their blushing honors; Old Age, the autumn, with chilling frosts, scattering the sear and yellow leaves which fall rustling to the ground.

From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. ~ATe learn that when the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands which con - nected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the Idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. THE TUSCAN The Tuscan is the most simpte and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany, whence it desives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and entablature have but few moldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where osnament would be superfluous. THE DORIC The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any olnaments on base or capital, except moldings; though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphe and metopes and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The solid composi - tion of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity ate chiefly required. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The Fellow Craft 85 several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention, it was more simple than in its present form, and the name of Tuscan was confessed upon it In aftertimes, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric. Hence the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of sts resemblance to that pillar in its original state. THE IONIC The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and the more delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes; and its cornices have dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians; as the famous Temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young woman, of elegant shape, dressed in her hair, as a con - trast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man. THE CORINTHIAN The Corinthian, the richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight votutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices; the cornice with dentils and modiltions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth by Calli - machus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the following remarkable circum - stance: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys, covered with a tile, placed over an acanthus-soot, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encompassed the basket until, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with the object, set about imitating the figure. The base of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus, the tile; and the volutes, the bending leaves."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"87 ~~stjChtingargus.nl ~~stjChtingargus.nI w.stichtingatgUS.nI ~.stjChtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl ~.stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargUS.fll w. stichtingargUS.fll ~.stiChtiflgargus.nl ~.stiChtingargus.nl ~.stiChtingargus.n~ ~,stjChtingargus.nl ~.stichtingargUS.fll w.stiChtingargus.nl ~.~tichtingargUS.fll ~~r.stichtingargUS.fll w.stichtingarguS.fll w. ~tichtingargus.fll w. sti Chtingargus.nl w. stichtingarguS.fll w.stichtingarguS.fll w. stichtingarguS.nl w.stiChtrngargus.nl w.stichtingarguS.fll w.stichtingarguS.fll w.stichtingarguS.fll w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl - w.stlChtingargus.nl w.stichtingarguS.fll w.stichtingarguS.fll w.stichtingarguS.fll w.stiChtingargus.nl w. sti Chtingargus.nl w,stiChtingargus.nl w. sttChtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingarguS.fll w .stichtingarguS.fll w .stichtingargUs.fll 86 Fellow Craft THE COMPOSITE The Composite is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has quarter-rounds, as the Tuscan and Doric orders, and is ten diameters high. Its cornice has dentils, or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. Such are the orders of architecture; and though three thousand years have winged their flight since the Grecian architects first executed their designs, the Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian stand today, as they stood in the early ages, cold embodi - ment of Strength, Grace, and Beauty. Sculptors have since toiled in vain for the invention of new designs, but the marble that unfolded its hidden beauties beneath Callimachus’ classic chisel has re - fused to awaken to a renewal of life, although Angelo and Phideas touched the block. These ancient and original orders are most revered by Masons. The Ionic we Masonically term the column of ‘Wisdom, because it wisely combines the proportions of strength and grace. It stands in the East and is represented by the Worshipful Master. The Doric stands in the West. Because it is the pillar of Strength in the Opera - tive Masonic temple, it is represented by the Senior Warden, the strong pillar in our Speculative temple. The Corinthian, in all its virginal sym - metry and foliated splendor, stands in the South, proud embodiment of elegance and Beauty; and is represented by the Junior Warden, whose duty it Fellow Craft is to observe the sun at its meridian height, which is the beauty and glory of the day. * * * THE FIVE STEPS also denote the five senses of human nature, which are Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. THE FIVE SENSES OF HUMAN NATURE The senses are the avenues through which the soul touches the world of material things. The objects of human knowledge are lnnumerable; the channels by which this knowledge is conveyed are few. HEARING Hearing is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to one another Our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires; and thus our reason is rendered capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The soul or spiritual side of our nature is, therefore, more dependent on this sense for its full growth, co~ordinatlon, and development than on any other of the five special senses. This sense con - veys to the infant the sound of its mother’s voice, that most potent, most precious, and most priceless of all influences in the nurturing and maturing of character, which begins to unfold even in early infancy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended by the forma - tion of this sense that we be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge from social intercourse with one another.

SEEING Seeing is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of Nature. By this sense we find our way on the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more, by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections of our fellow. creatures when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance will display the hypocrisy to the discern - ing eye. In fine, the rays of Light which administer to this sense are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admir - ation. Its structure and its appurtenances evince the admirable contrivance of Nature for performing all its various external and internal motions; while the vat iety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demonstrates this organ to be one of Nature’s greatest masterpieces. FEELING Feeling is that sense by which we distinguish the dif - ferent qualities of bodies: such as heat and cold, hard - ness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion, and extension. These three senses, Hearing, Seeing, and Feeling, are deemed peculiarly essential among Masons. They have always been highly revered; because by Hearing we hear the word, by Seeing we see the sign, and by Feeling we feel the token whereby one brother may know another in darkness as well as in the light. Fellow Craft 89 SMELLING Smelling is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and indeed most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of great subtlety, as well in the state of life and growth as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These efiluvia, drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are a means by which all bodies are dis - tinguished. Hence it is evident that there is a manifest design in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in respiration. TASTING Tasting enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by Nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is injurious. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by it we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. Smelling and tasting are inseparably connected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices. The proper use of these Five Senses enables us to form just and accurate notions of the operations of Nature. And when we reflect on the objects with which our senses are gratified, we are enabled lo attend to them till they become familiar objects of thought, and we become conscious of the infinite"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"r W.StiChtiflgargUS.fll w.stiChtingarguS.nl w.StiChtingarguS.nl w.

On the mind all our knowledge must depend. What, therefore, can be a more proper subject for the investiga. tion of Masons? This transcendent expression of God’s bounty to man includes Memory, Imagination, Taste, Reasoning, Moral Perception, and all the active powers of the soul, and presents a vast and boundless field for philosophical disquisition which far exceeds human in - quiry and involves peculiar mysteries, known only to Nature and to Nature’s God to whom we are all indebted for creation, preservation, and every blessing we enjoy. You will now ascend the Five Steps, commencing this time with the left foot, where we left off. , * * The Seven Steps allude to many sevens—the seven sabbatical years, seven years of plenty, seven years of famine, seven years to build King Solo - mon s Temple, seven golden candlesticlcs—but more particularly to the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences. THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES The Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, which are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy, are here illustrated. Gram - mar is the science which teaches us to express our ideas in appropriate words, which we may afterward beautify and adorn by means of Rhetoric; while Logic instructs us how to think and reason with propriety, and to make language subordinate to Fellow Craft 91 thought. Arithmetic, which is the science of com - puting by numbers, is absolutely essential, not only to a thorough knowledge of all mathematical science, but also to a proper pussuit of our daily vocations. Geometry, or the application of Arith - metic to sensible quantities, is of all sciences the most important, since by it we are enabled to ineas - ure and survey the globe that we inhabit. Its principles et~tend to other spheres; and, employed in the contemplation and measurement of the sun, moon, and heavenly bodies, they constitute the science of Astronomy. Lastly, when our minds are filled and our thoughts enlarged by the con - templation of all the wonders which these sciences open to our view, Music comes forward, to soften our hearts and cultivate our affections by its sooth - ing influences. This division of the Winding Stairs, unlike the other two, has in this degree but one signification, that of knowledge in general. In the seventh century, and in fact for a long time afterwards, the circle of instruction to which all of the learning of the most distinguished philosophers was confined, was limited to what was then called the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, which were divided into two branches, the Trivium and the Quad - rivium. The Trivium included Grammar, Rhetotic, and Logic; and the Quadrivium, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. The word Trivsum was derived from the old Latin and signified a place where three roads met. Quadrivium means a place where four roads meet, or as we say, a “cross roads,” hence the origin of the term, the “paths of learning.” These seven heads were supposed to include univelsal knowledge; and he who was master of these was thought to have no need of a preceptor to explain any books or to solve any of the problems that come within the compass of human reason. The Trivium"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.ril w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.ril w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.~tichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl - w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl W.StiChtingargus.ril w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl ¶4 92 Fellow Craft has fui-nished him with a key to all language; and the Quadrivium has opened to him all the secret laws of Natus e. At a time when few wer e instructed in the Trivium and very few studied the Quadrivium, to be master of both was sufficient to complete one’s character as a philosopher. The propriety, therefore, of adopting the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences as symbolic of the last stage of human learning is apparent; and although all of the beautiful and instructive lessons of this lecture should be carefully absorbed by the mind, particularly so should the symbolism of these SEVEN STEPS, repre - senting Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. GRAMMAR Grammar, teaching the proper arrangement of woids according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people, is the key by which alone the door can be opened to the understanding of speech. It is Grammar which reveals the admirable art of language and unfolds its various constituent parts—their names, definitions, and respective offices; it unravels, as it were, the thread of which the web of speech is composed. These reflections seldom occur to any man before his acquaintance with the art; yet it is most certain that, without a knowledge of Grammar, it is xery difficult precision, and purity, to speak with propriety, RHETORIC It is by Rhetoric that the art of speaking eloquently is acquired. To be an eloquent speaker, in the proper sense of the word, is far from being either a common or an easy attainment; it is the art of being persuasive and commanding, the art, not only of pleasing the fancy, but of speaking both to the understanding and to the heart. LOGIC Logic is that science which directs us how to form clear and distinct ideas of things, and thereby prevents Fellow Craft 93 us from being misled by their similitude. It consists of a regular train of argument whence we infes, deduce, and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted, or granted; and in it are employed the facul - ties of conceiving, judging, reasoning, and disposing, all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another until the point in question is finally determined. Of all the sciences, that concerning the human mind is certainly most worthy of study; and the proper manner of conducting its several powers in the attainment of truth and knowledge is a noble acquisilion. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation or groundwork of our inquiries, particularly in the pursuit of those sub - lime principles which claim our attention as Masons. ARITHMETIC Arithmetic is the art of numbering, or that part of mathematics which considers the properties of numbers in general. We have but a very imperfect idea of things without quantity, and as imperfect a conception of quan - tity itself without the help of Arithmetic. All the works of the Almighty are made in number, weight, and measure; therefore, to understand them rightly we must understand arithmetical calculations. The greater ad - vancement we make in the mathematical sciences, the more capable we shall be of considering the ordinary objects of our conceptions; and finally, we shall be led thereby to a more comprehensive knowledge of our great Creator and the works of His Creation. It teaches the Speculative Mason to strive always to add to his knowl - edge, never to subtract anything from the character of his neighbor, to multiply his benevolences to his fellow creatures, and to divide his means with a suffering brother. GEOMETRY Geometry treats of the powers and properties of mag - nitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered: from a point to a line, from a line to a surface, and from a surface to a solid."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w, stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. slichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl 94 Fellow Craft A point is the beginning of all geometrical matter. A line is a continuation of a point. A surface is a figure o~ two dimensions namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth, and thickness (for example, a cube). With the aid of Geometry the architect can draw his plans and execute his designs, the general can arrange his soldiers, the engineer can mark out grounds for en - campments, the geographer can measure the dimensions of the world and all things therein contained, delineate the extent of the seas, and specify the divisions of em - pires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it the astronomer also can make his observations, and fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the foundation of architecture and the root of mathe - matics. MUSIC Music is that elevated science which affects the pas - sions by sound. There are few whu have not felt its charms and acknowledged its expression to be intelligible to the heart. It is a language of delightful sensations, far more eloquent than words. It breathes to the ear the clearest intimations; it touches and gently agitates the agreeable and sublime passions; it wraps us in melan - choly, and elevates us in joy; it dissolves and inflames; and it melts us in tenderness. This science is truly con - genial to the nature of man; for by its powerful charms the most discordant passions may be harmonized and brought into perfect unison. But it never sounds with such seraphic harmony as when employed in singing hymns of praise to the Creator of the universe. To be without a perception of the charms of Music, is to be without the finer traits of humanity. It is the medium which gives the natural world communication with the spiritual; and few are they who have not felt its power and acknowledged its expression to be intel - ligible to the heart. Fellow Craft 95 It has a voice for every age and a capacity for every degree of taste and intelligence. Its lullaby soothes the infant in his mother’s arms; its joyous notes wing the tripping feet in the dance; its martial tones inspire the spirit of patriotism, nerve the warrior’s arm, and fire his heart. The stirring strains of national airs, heard on the rough edge o~ battle, have ever thrilled the soldier, causing him to burn with an emulous desire to lead the perilous advance, and animating him to deeds of heroic valor and the most sublime devotion. Here the organist pisys softly the strains of ~~1-iome, Sweet i1ome,~ or some other well-known lullaby, during which the Deacon continues. It was our mothers’ cradle song, and has often lulled us to sleep in infancy. The mellowing tides of old cathedral airs, vibrating through aisles and arches, have stilled the ruffled spirit, and, sweeping aside the discord - ant passions of men, have borne them along its resistless current, until their united voices have joined in swelling the chorus of the heaven•born anthem: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, Peace, good will to men. Again, it lulls the passions of men, and lifts as by Divine influence the burden of care from the weary and heavy-laden. And finally, when the soul yearns for those unseen vistas which are beyond the span of the present hour, for that communion with God which is its highest life, Music, the handmaid of heaven, bears the spirit up and gives it a taste of immortality. ASTRONOMY Astronomy is that sublime science which inspires the contemplative mind to soar aloft and read the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the Great Creator in the heavens. How nobly eloquent of the Deity is the celestial hemi - sphere, spangled with the most magnificent heralds of His infinite glory! They speak to the whole universe; for there is no people so barbaric that they do not under - stand, and no nation so distant that they cannot hear."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl ii 96 Fellow Craft The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament sheweth His handrwork. Assisted by Astronomy, we can obseive the magni - tudes, and calculate the periods and eclipses of the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globes, the system oE the worlds, and the preliminary laws of Nature. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive unparalleled instances of wis - dom and goodness, and through the whole creation trace the glorious Author by His works. My brother, having perfected your knowledge in the groundwork of learning, we will ascend the Seven Steps. * * 55 0 EMBLEM OF PLENTY * * * * * * * * The Ephraimites had long been a stubborn and rebellious people, whom Jephthah had often sought Fellow Craft 97 to subdue by mild and lenient measures; but to no avail. Highly incensed at Jephthah for not hav - ing been called to fight and share in the rich spoils of the Amonitish war, they gathered together a mighty army, crossed the river Jordan, and pre - pared to give Jephthah battle; but he, being ap - prised of their approach, called together the men of Israel, went out, gave them battle, and put them to flight. To make his victory complete, he sta - tioned guards at the passes on the banks of the river, and said unto them: “If you see any strang - ers pass this way, say unto them, ‘Say Shibboletb.’ “ The Ephraimites, being of a different tribe, could not frame to pronounce Shibboleth, but instead could say only Sibboleth. And there fell that day on the field of battle, and at the several passes on the banks of the river, forty and two thousand; after which Jephthah ruled quietly in [srael until the time of his death, which was six years. The passage of Scripture referred to In this section is found in Judges 12: 1-6 The following lecture may be given here: My brother, as an Entered Apprentice you were in your Masonic childhood, and the Iseart, being more im - pressionable, more readily received the precepts of our creed; and was thereby better fitted for the reception of that Divine Truth, which is the full fruition of the Mason’s hope. And now, having passed the porch of nus mystic temple, at the very entrance of the Middle Chamber, where craftsmen ply their tools, your Masonic manhood begins; and as the faculties of the mind waken into activity, we pause to contemplate this mighty Masonic fabric, built on foundations buried in the dusty ages of the past."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w,stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w,~tichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w, stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl 4 4 98 Fellow Craft The origin of our Order is written upon the unpub - lished pages of antiquity. Ages ago, upon the eastern plains, it has been said, our Institution was set up, founded upon principles more lasting than the metal wrought into the statues of ancient kings. Men have come and men have gone in fleeting generations, but the principles of this sacred Order go on forever. Seasons like a whirling wheel have fled as hours down through the dim corridors of time; but through the tempest and the storm, through the attrition of the waves and the gliding sands of life, through evil report as well as good, Freemasonry has ever stood unshaken. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devasta - tions of war have laid waste and destroyed many valu - able monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exer - tions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, still survives. Moving serenely and with a majestic tread, scattering blessings and benedic - tions in its path, like that wonderful river of Egypt whose beneficent tide moistens the parched sod and strews its course with abundant harvests, our Fraternity has main - tained its benevolent influence, spreading wider and wider over the earth with the passing of the years. The attentive ear still receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Masonry are still safely lodged in the respository of faithful breasts. Ever since symmetry began and harmony displayed her charms, Operative Masonry has had a being. The architectural ruins discovered in Nineveh, Babylon, and Thebes, and the tombs and obelisks scattered along the banks of the Nile attest the skill with which our ancient brethren wrought. But to our Jewish and Tyrian breth - ren belong the triumphs of artistic skill. Seven long years and a half, mid a silence unbroken by the sound of iron tool, they toiled on Mount Moriah in the erection of a monument to the living God. All the beauty of design and elegance of embellishment known to science and art were employed in its construction; and Fellow Craft 99 when the woik was done, Architecture was beggared. But the Temple stood, a worthy habitation for the Shekinah, and a glorious monument to the genius of Operative Masonry. As a practical art it has hitherto concerned itself with man’s temporal wants, furnishing him with temples and dwellings in life, and with tombs and mausoleums in death. It abuunded in technical terms, and employed numerous instruments peculiar to itseH; but the intimate associations of the Masons employed in the building of King Solomon’s Temple revealed the truth: That above and beyond the mere gratification of our physical wants were the moral and spiritual cravings of mankind, a necessity for social intercourse, and recognition of man’s duties to his fellowman; and King Solomon, inspis ed by the Deity, conceived that grand idea which culminated in Speculative Masonry, a system which, entering into abstruse investigations of the soul, reminds us of a higher and better life, and eternity beyond the grave; a pro - found Science that takes from the Operative Art its technical terms, its implements, and its rules, clothes them in symbolism and teaches the Speculative Mason their spiritual use. Thus Freemasonry comes to us from the Temple, an Operative Art combined with Speculative Science. The language and implements of the artisan are used for the inculcation of the doctrine of pure ethics. It makes no profession of Christianity, and wars not against sectarian creeds or doctrines; but looks forward to the time when the labor of our ancient brethren shall be symbolized by the erection of a spiritual temple whose moral grandeur shall be commensurate with civilization; A temple in which there shall be but one altar and but one worship; one common altar of Masonry, on which the Veda, Sutra, Zend-Avesta, Koran, and Holy Bible shall lie untouched by sacrilegious hands; and at whose shrine the Hindoo, the Persian, the Assyrian, the Chal - dean, the Egyptian, the Chinese, the Mohammedan, the Jew, and the Christian may kneel and with one united voice celebrate the praises of the Supreme Architect of the Universe. w. stichtingargus.nl"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"-I’ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stkhtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl K 100 * * * CORN * * * Fellow Craft * * * WrNE * * * * SE 55 OrL * * St * * * * * -5~ * * * SE ± The * ~ * is a perpetual condemnation of pro - fanity, untruthfulness, impiety, and vice.

By it, we discover the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it, we discover how the planets move in their respective orbits and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it, we account ~or the return of the seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of Nature. A survey of Nature, and the observation of her beau - tiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the devine plan and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design; and the plans which he laid down, improved by time and experience, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. Tools and implements of architecture and symbolic emblems most expressive are selected by the Fraternity to imprint on the mind wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, have been transmitted unimpaired the most eKcellent tenets of our Institution. The following lecture on Geometry is sometimes given, in lieu of the foregoing: Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the bass upon which the superstructure of Freemasonry is erected. Regarding man as a rational and intelligent being capable of enjoyment and pleasure to an extent limited only by the acquisition of useful knowledge, our Order points him to ihe study of the Liberal Arts and Sciences, and to the possession of knowledge as the most fitting and proper occupation for the God-like endowments with which he is gifted. Indeed, all who frequent our Masonic Temple are charged to labor faithfully in the wide and unbounded field o~ human improvement, from whkh they are assured of reaping a most glorious harvest, a harvest rkh in happiness to the ‘whole family of man, and in manifesta - Fellow Craft 103 t~on of the goodness of God. Your attention is especially direcied to the science of Geometry, no royal road, ‘tis true; but to one seeking true wisdom, it must prove more attractive than palace walks by regal taste adorned. The ancient philosophers placed such a high estimate upon this science that all who frequented the groves of the Sacred Academy were compelled to explore its heavenly paths; and no one whose mind was unexpanded by its precepts was intrusted with the instruction of the young. Even Plato, justly deemed the first of the philosophers, when asked as to the probable occupation of the Deity, replied, “He geometrizes continually.” If we consider the symmetry and order which govern all the works of creation, we must admit that Geometry pervades the universe.

CHARGE AT PASSING TO THE DEGREE OF FELLOW CRAFT Brother: Being passed to the second degree of Freemasonry, we congratulate you on your prefer - ment.

T Fellow Craft 105 or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them; as your own experience must have estab - lished their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support, and you are to be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate nor aggravate the offenses of your brethren; but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the Liberal Arts, that valuable branch of education which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recom - mended to your consideration, especially the science of Geometry, which is established as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Freemasonry, originally synonymous teims, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with most useful knowledge; for while it proves the wonderful properties of Nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new charactet, it is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Order by steadily persevering in the practice of every com - mendable virtue.

In IThe manner Masons have emblematically represented the omniscience of the Great Architect o~ the Universe. We have here a copy of the ancient Egyptian emblem of the eye of Osiris, taken from the ancient monuments, and found both painted and sculptured on the yet remaining temple walls.”—Brown, Stellar Theology and Masonic Ar - trono my. MASTER MASON Freemasonry, in every degree, as before stated, is pro - gressive. A knowledge of it can be attained only by time, patience, and application. In the first degree, we are taught the duties we owe to God, our neighbor, and our - selves. En the second, we are more thoroughly inducted into the mysteries of moral science, and learn to trace the goodness and majesty of the Creator by minutely analyzing His works. But the third degree is the cement of the whole. It is designed to unite men, by mystic points of fellowship, in a bond of fraternal affection and enduring loyalty. It is among brethren of this degree that the ancient landmarks of the Order are preserved; and it is from them that we derive that fund of informa - tion which none but ingenious and expert Masons can supply. It is also from brethren of this degree that the rulers of the Craft are selected; for it is only from those who are capable of giving instruction that we can reasonably expect to receive it. 0 FIRST SECTION The first section of this degree, as of the two preceding, is initiatory; and a knowledge of it is indispensable to every biother who would make himself useful in the ceremonial transactions of a Lodge. 0 RECEPTION The Compasses are peculiarly consecrated to this degree, because, within their extreme points, when prop - erly extended, are emblematically said to be enclosed the principal tenets of our profession; and hence the moral eve OF OSIRIS j"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"I i~ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl 108 Alas ter lilason application of the Compasses is to those precious jewels of a Master Mason—Friendship, Morality, and Brotherly Love.

It recites the legend, the symbolic interpreta - tion of which testifies to our faith in the immortality of the soul; while it also exemplifies an instance of integrity and firmness seldom equaled and never excelled, and is in strong contrast to the development of those passions which debase and ruin all who indulge in them. The ceremonial of the Degree of Master Mason is unquestionably the most important, most impressive, and most instructive portion of the Ritual of Ancient Free - masonry. It transcends all others in the profoundness of its philosophy, in the wide range of ideas it aims to eluci - date, and in the dramatic interest with which it is in - vested. Wrong interpretations, however—assuming what is evidently a philosophical and ethical Mythus to be the description of a literal fact—have in a certain degree weakened the effects which it is capable of producing. That portion of the Rite which is connected with the legend of the Tyrian Artist is well worth the deep and earnest study of thoughtful men. But it should be studied as a myth, and not as a fact; and, if thus accepted, it will be found exceedingly rich in instructive lessons—lessons, too, which admit of immense variety of application. Whereas, if it be regarded simply as a ceremony commemorative of historical occurrences, ii has no philosophical importance or significance whatever. 55 55 55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingarguS.fll w.stichtingarguS.fll w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingarguS.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl 112 Master Mason Against the notion that it is the representation of an event that actually occurred in the Temple, it may well be uiged that, outside of Masonic tradition, there is no proof that such an event as is related in connection with the Temple-Builder ever took place; and, besides, the ceremony is older, by far, than the age of Solomon. There are characters impressed upon it which cannot be mistaken. It is thoroughly Egyptian, and is closely allied to the supreme rite of the Isianic mystesres. Osiris, Isis, and Typhon are the three principal figures in the ancient Egyptian mythology. Typhon—i. e., Evil—made war upon Osiris—i. e., Beauty, Goodness, and Truth. Between these spiritual forces, there long raged a fierce conflict, of which all the combats, antago - nisms, and disorders in the outward, visible world were only far-distant echoes, or feeble reverberations. Typhon, or Evil, for a period appeared in triumph. With his wiles and ares, he overcame Osiris, or Truth, dismem - bered his body, and concealed the fragments in the several qua, ters of the earth. Then the whole universe was shrouded in gloom, and resounded with lamentations and mourning over the fall of the Beautiful and Good. Isis set forth on her woful pilgrimage to find the re - mains of the beloved Osiris. After many disappointments and trials, her effoits were crowned with success. The great day of triumph came. Typhon, or Evil, was de - stroyed by Horus The tomb of Osiris opened; and as the embodiment of Ordes, Truth, and Justice, he came forth, victorious in the possession of immortal life; and harmony, peace, and joy prevailed through the universe. The Egyptian rite was a dramatic representation of these events; and its purpose is sufficiently obvious. It pictured, in imp! essive and solemn manner, the mighty and unceasing conflict of Truth with Error, Light with Darkness, Beauty with Deformity, Virtue with Vice, and Life with Death; the final, certain triumph of the former; and the sure defeat and destruction of the latter. This myth is the prototype of the Temple legend. Osiris and the Tyrian Architect are one and the same; not a mortal individual, but an idea, an Immortal Prin - ciple. In Egyptian Freemasonry, Osiris was the type of Beauty, Goodness, Order, and Truth. So, in the Temple- Master Mason 113 myth, the Tyrian is the symbol of Beauty and Order, and of that Creative Art which is ever ready to seize the Ideal and to incarnate it in material forms—that divine art which robes the physical world in immortal splendors, embellishes and beautifies life, idealizes all Nature, trans - forming dull and prosy reality into a sunny, flowery dream: “Clothing the palpable and the familiar With golden exhalations of the dawn.” Typhon was slain; and the iniquitous triad of the Temple met a deserved doom. The Master’s rite from this point of view has a wider scope and deeper signi - ficance than if recognized as merely the record of an historical fact. In the one case, it simply tells us that a good man fell in the discharge of his duty, and that his foes were punished. In the other, it embraces all the pos - sible conditions of Humanity, ranges through all worlds, reveals the Law of Eternal Justice, announces the omni - potence of ‘I’ruth, and proclaims the immortality of man. In this sense, the legend of the Tyrian is perpetually repeated in the history of human affairs. Orpheus was murdered, and his body thrown into the Hebrus; Socrates was made to drink the hemlock; Pontius Pilate, shrinking before a priesthood, surrendered the Nazarene to the rabble; Hypatia perished at the hands of a mob led by a bishop; the Maid of Orleans, Savonarola, and Bruno expired at the stake to atone for differing with ecclesias - tics; unnumbered victims of the Inquisition suffered torture and death when a decadent and evil-inspired clergy ran riot with vengeance. So, in all ages, we have seen Evil temporarily triumphant and Virtue and Truth calumniated, persecuted, crucified, and slain. But Eternal Justice marches surely and swiftly through the world The Typhons, the children of darkness, the plotters of crime, all the infinitely varied forms of evil, are swept into oblivion; and Truth and Virtue—for a time laid low—come forth, clothed with diviner majesty, and crowned with~ everlasting glory. Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again; The eternal years of God are hers: While Error, wounded, writhes in pain, And dies’ amid her worshipers."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nt w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w, stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl 114 Master Mason In th’~e urn puriusupuIr~, rile rrurr,~nr ~s~elve always concealed a mystical meaning, and was considered a symbol of divine ideas.

Man that is born of woman, is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing that his days are determined, the number of his months is with Thee; Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that Ihe tender branch thereof shall not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground, yet, through the scent of water, it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from. the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down and riseth not. Till the heavens be no more shall he not wake nor be roused out of his sleep.

As Entered Apprentices we were received among Masons in a state of blindness and destitution, emblemati - cal of the entrance of all men upon this their mortal state of existence when, weak and helpless, they are necessarily dependent upon others for protection and life. It incul - cated the striking lessons of natural equality and mutual dependence. It taught us to seek solace for our own distresses in the active principles of universal beneficence and charity, and to extend relief and consolation to our fellow creatures in the hour of their affliction. It enabled us to free the soul from the dominion of pride and preju - dice; to look beyond the narrow limits of particular institutions, whether civil or religious; and to view in every member of the human race a brother. Above all it taught us to bend with humility and resignation to the Great Architect of the Universe; to dedicate our hearts, thus purified from every malignant passion, to His glory and the good of our fellow creatures; and to prepare ourselves for the reception of truth and wisdom.

The secrets of Nature and the principles of moral tiuth were thus unveiled before us. We learned the just estimate of those wondrous faculties with which God has endowed she beings formed after His own image, and felt the duty which He has thereby imposed upon us, of cultivating this divine attribute with the most diligent and unremit - ting care and attention; that we may be enabled to show forth His glory and to render ourselves useful to the happiness of mankind. The degeee concludes with the reminder that we all, without exception, are traveling on the Level of Time to that “undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns.” To the man whose mind has thus been molded to virtue and science, Nature presents one more great and useful lesson—the knowledge of himself. She prepares him by contemplation for the closing hours of his existence; for when, by means of that contemplation, she has conducted him through the intricate windings of this mortal life, she finally instructs him how to die. She leads him to reflect upon his inevitable destiny; and prompts the inward monitor to say that, to the just and virtuous man, Death has no terrors equal to the stain of falsehood, and that the certainty of death at any time is preferable to the possibility of dishonor. Of this great principle the Master Mason degree af - fords a glorious example in the unshaken fidelity and noble death of our G. M. H. A. Your representation of our G. M. H. A. is a type of the upright man in his progress through life. Although there was a time when others might implore Divine protection for him, now, in the presence of Death, through his own lips must he seek salvation. Strong in youth and confident in his strength, he starts forth to execute the designs which he has drawn upon the great Trestle Board of his life. He essays to salk’ forth through the S. G. upon the sunny period of Youth; but at the very outset he meets his first enemy, * ~5 representing his own wealtoesses and the evil passions Master Mason 121 which may beset his way: such as enxy, hate, licentious - ness, and debauchery, defacing the beautiful mirror of his soul by their baneful influences. But these may be overcome; and, sustained by the unerring dictates of the monitor within, he presses for - ward on life’s journey to the W. G., or middle period of life. There he meets his second and still more powerful enemy, * * ~, fitly representing sorrow, remorse, mis - fortune, disease, poverty, ingratitude, and the hostility of enemies. Weary and faint from the conflict, but with integrity too deeply rooted to be shaken by the vicissitudes of fate, he treads the way of life unfalteringly. Though the other enemies may have been subdued, yet, at the E. G., that opening through which he looks out upon a brighter and better world, in the evening of his days, must he meet his last and terrible enemy, * * ‘~, representing Death—Death, feom whom there can be no escape and before whom all must sooner or later yield. To the careless and thoughtless the lesson would end here; but the upright and true Mason will pursue it further, and apply it to the eternal salvation of his soul so beautifully typified by the ever-green Sprig of Acacia. Which teaches us that, although our frail bodies must, sooner or later, molder in the bosom of our Mother Earth—yet through the merits of the Divine promises contained in the Word of God, we may confidently hope that our souls will bloom in immortal grandeur.

KING SOLOMON’S TEMPLE was situated on Mount Moriah, near the place wheie Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac. It afterwards became the thresh - ing floor of Oman, the Jebusite, which David purchased for the purpose of erecting an altar, and where he met and appeased the destroying angel. This magnificent structure was commenced in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon, on the second day of the month Zif, the second month of the sacred year. Seven years were employed in its consti uction; during which time, Josephus informs us, it rained not in the daytime, that the workmen might not he obstructed in their labor. From sacred history we learn also that there was not heard the sound of axe, hammer, or any metal tool in the house while it was building. This famous fabric is said to have been supported by 1,453 columns and 2,906 pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. There were employed in its construction three Grand Masters, 3,300 Masters or Overseers of the work, 80,000 Fellow Crafts or hewers in the mountains and quarries, and 70,000 Entered Apprentices, or hearers of burdens. All these were so classed and arranged by the wisdom of King Solomon that neither envy, discord, nor confusion was suffered to interrupt or distuib that universal peace which pervaded the world at this important period. It was also symbolically supported by THREE PRIM - CIPAII. COLUMNS, Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, re - ferred to in the preceding degrees, which are here represented by our three ancient Grand Masters, Solomon, King of Israel; Hiram, King of Tyre; and Hiram Abif. The pillar Wisdom represents Solomon, King of Israel, by whose wisdom the Temple was erected—that superb model of excellence which has so honored and exalted his name. The pillar Strength represents Hiram, King of Tyre, whose wealth and power strengthened King Solo- Master Mason 123 mon in his great and important undertaking. And the pillar Beauty represents Hiram Abif, the Widow’s Son of the tribe of Naphtali, by whose curious craft and cunning workmanship the Temple was so beautified and adorned. There are two classes of emblems in this degree, the first of which is monitorial and consists of the Three Steps, the Pot of Incense, the Bee Hive, the Book of Constitutions Guarded by the Tiler’s Sword, the Sword Pointing to a Naked Heart, the All-Seeing Eye, the Anchor and Ark, the Forty- seventh Problem of Euclid, the Hour Glass, and the Scythe.

THE POT OF INCENSE is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to Deity. And as this glows wtth fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with grati - tude to the Great Beneficent Author of our exist - ence for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. THE BEE HIVE is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in the •1 Master Mason 125 heavens to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so should we ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fel - low-creatures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them without inconvenience to ourselves. When we take a survey of Nature, we view man in his infancy more helpless and indigent than the brute crea - tion. He lies languishing for days and months; and for years he is totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to make man independent of all other beings; but as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent upon one another for protection and security. For in this way they enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus, man was cseated for an active, social life, the noblest sole in the plan of God. And he who will not contribute to the common stock of knowledge and under - standing, can be deemed only a dione in the hive of Nature, a useless member of society, unworthy of the attention of Masons.

It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the Arts and Sciences. THE HOUR GLASS is an emblem of human life. Behold, how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We can - not without astonishment observe the little particles which are contained in this chronometer—how they pass away almost imperceptibly; and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour, they are all exhausted. Thus passes man! Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow he blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost which nips the shoot, and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls like an autumn leaf, to enrich our Mother Earth. THE SCYTHE is an emblem of Time, which cuts the brittle thread of life and launches us into eternity. Behold, what havoc the Scythe of Time makes among the human race! If, by chance, we escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and, with health and vigor, arrive at the years of manhood; yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring Scythe of Time, and be gathered into that undiscovered country where our fathers have gone before us.

They are the Setting Maul, Spade, Coffin, and Sprig of Acacia. vs * * Even as you this evening, my brother, all Master Masons have been raised from a figurative death to a reunion with the former companions of their toil. Ob - serve that the light of a Master Mason is darkness visible—a Substitute Word—serving only to depict that gloom which rests on the prospect of futurity. It is that mysterious veil which human wisdom cannot penetrate, unless assisted by the Light from above. Yet even by this feeble ray we possess, we perceive that we stand on the very brink of the grave, into which you have just figuratively descended, and which, when this riansitory life shall have passed away, will again receive our bodies into its cold bosom. Let the emblems of mortality which lie before you, lead you to contemplate your inevitable destiny, and guide your reflection to that most interesting of human studies, the knowledge of your - self. Be careful to perform your allotted task while it is yet day, for you know not when the time is; you know not when the Master cometh—at even, at midnight, or in the morning. Continue to listen to the voice of Nature, typified by the Sprig of Acacia, that ever-green and ever- living FAITH in the merits of the Lion of the Tribe of Judab. Which bears witness that even in this perishable frame resides a vital and immortal principle; inspires a holy confidence that the Lord of Life will enable us to trample the king of terrors beneath our feet; and strengthens us with confidence and composure to look forward to ~ blessed immortality. And now, my brother, let us see to it, and so regulate our lives by the plumb-line of justice, ever squaring our actions by the square of virtue, that when the Grand Warden of Heaven shall call for us, we may be found ready. Let us cultivate assiduously the noble tenets of our profession, brotherly love, relief, and truth. From ‘A Master Mason 131 the square let us learn morality, from the level equality, and from the plumb rectitude of conduct. Then let us imitate our G. M. H. A. in all his varied perfection. Let us emulate his amiable and virtuous character, his unfeigned piety to God, and his inflexible fidelity to his trust, that, like him, we may welcome the grim tyrant Death, and receive him as a kind messenger sent by our Supreme Grand Master to translate us from this imperfect to that all-perfect, glorious, and celestial Lodge above, where the Grand Architect of the Universe foiever reigns. AN ADDRESS TO A NEWLY RAISED BROTE-IER My brother, you are now, technically speaking, a Mason; but whether you are going to be a Mason in reality, rests entirely with yourself. The members of this Lodge deemed you honest in your expressed desire to be a Mason; and I urge you to show the Fsaternity that they were not mistaken in their judgment of you, and that they have not erred in admitting you into our ancient and honorable Order. It would be well, my bsother, at this time to ask yourself the question, “What is it to be a Mason ?“ Do you think that membership in a Masonic Lodge makes you a Mason? If you have the pioper conception of Masonry you will admit that it does not, except in name; for membership in a Masonic Lodge can no more make you a Mason than membership in a musical club can make you a musician. However, if you are so inclined and have natural musical talent, in such membership you will find helpful stimulus and pleasant fellowship with congenial and kindred spirits. And so it is in Masonry and the Masonic Lodge. The involun - tary thoughts of your heart and the voluntary acts of your life determine your character as a man and a Mason.

Men of this last class are God’s noblemen. But if I could not be num - bered with these last, I had rather be a Mason by nature —that is, at heart—than a Mason only in name. In the degrees the practice of many commendable vistues was enjoined upon you, only a few of which, perhaps, you can recall at this moment, and too many for me to re - iterate lust now. But let me sum them all up by remind - ing you of just one symbol in the first degree—that of a point within a circle. The Worshipful Master told you the point represented an individual brother—yourself; the circle, the boundary line of your duty toward God and man, beyond which you should never suffer your passions, interests, or prejudices to betray you on any occasion. The circumference of this circle—the boundazy line of your duty—is clearly defined in the sacred Scrip - tures and elucidated by the patron saints of Masonry; and ‘vshile you keep yourself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that you materially err. congratulate you, my brother; and may the G. A. 0. T. U. guide, guaid, and protect you through life and endow you with a competency of Divine Wisdom, that by the secrets of this art you may be the better enabled to display the beauties of godliness to the honor of His holy name. AN ADDRESS ON CHARITY Mv BaoTssaR:—With this right hand I welcome you to felloss ship in this Lodge and extend to you all of the rights and privileges of this ancient and honorable Fraternity. A Fraternity whose cornerstone is Charity. Charity is the brightest jewel in the Masonic Crown. It is the Corinthian pillar, the entablature that lends Master Mason 133 strength, grace, and beauty to the entire fabric. If we attempt to enumerate its beauties, the cooler powers of the mind melt into ecstasy. Charity is the radiant spark of love emanating from God, the source of all love. The heart is its empire, and before its lenient sovereignty bows every discordant passion. But the Charity of which I speak is not that Charity circumscribed by the narrow limits of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, or binding up the wounds of the afflicted; but that broader, grander, nobler Charity that regards all men as brothers. The Charity that is swift of foot and ready of hand in the common cause of hu - manity. The Charity that writes the faults of a brother on the shifting sands and his virtues on tables of endur - ing marble. The Charity of which He who spoke not with the tongues of man but of angels was the illustrious example. Let this, the Mason’s Charity, burn upon the altar of your heart a living fire, whose gentle warmth shall radiate fellowship, morality, brotherly love, and obedience to the Most High. Liberties and creeds, articles of faith, and rules of dis - cipline have stained the rubric pages of history, while speculative points of doctrine have occasioned more mis - ery in the world than all of the crimes for which nations have been punished and recalled to their duty. Here we array no man for his political opinion, nor do we dictate his religious creed. To himself and his country, we leave the one; to his conscience and his God, we commit the other. To the altar of Freemasonry all men bring their most votive offerings. Around it all men, whether they have received their teachings from Confucius, Zoroaster, Moses, Mohammed or the founder of the Christian re - ligion—just so long as they believe in the universality of the fatherhood of God and universality of the brother - hood of man—meet upon a common level. The Jew returns to his synagogue, the Mohammedan to his mosque and the Christian to his temple—each better prepared for the solemn duties of life by the associations in this universal brotherhood. —9"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus .nl W. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.ni w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI (K 134 Master Mason It is to this institution, born of heaven in the gray of the world’s morning, before poets sang or historians wrote, that I am privileged this evening to extend to you a craftsman’s greeting. And I charge you by the noblest instincts of your being, by all that you honor and revere, by the ties that bind you to earth, and by your hope of heaven, so to live, and so to act, that your Masonic life may be as an open book known and read by all men. Finally my brother, I do assort you that whatever of good you do is but duty done, If a sorrow you have lightened or a teardrop wiped away; if of poverty’s load you have lifted a share from some weary burdened soul; if but a cup of cool water you have lifted to some fam - ishing mortal’s lips; then so far have you exemplified the divine teachings of Freemasonry, and so far have you done as our Father commanded.

You are now bound by duty, honor, and gratitude, to be faithful to your trust; to support the dignity of your character on every occasion; and to enforce, by precept and example, obedience to the tenets of the Order. Master Mason 135 In the character of a Master Mason, you are authorized to correct the exrors and irregularities of your uninformed brethren, and to guard them against a breach of fidelity. To preserve the repu - tation of the Fraternity unsullied, must be your constant care; and for this purpose it is your province to recommend to your inferiors, obedience and submission; to your equals, courtesy and affa - bility, and to your superiors, kindness and con - descension. Universal benevolence you are always to incul - cate; and by the regularity of your own behavior, afford the best example for the conduct of others less informed. The ancient landmarks of the Order, intrusted to your care, you are carefully to observe, and never suffer them to be infringed, or countenance a deviation from the established usages and customs of the Fraternity.

No Freemason can be buried with the formalities of the Fraternity unless at his own request or that of his family, communicated to the Master of the Lodge of which he was a member at the time of his death, foreigners or sojourners excepted; nor unless he has received the Master Mason degree. To this rule there can be no exception. 2. Fellow Crafts and Entered Apprentices are not entitled to these obsequies, nor can they be allowed in the procession, as Masons, at a Masonic funeral. 3. The Master of the Lodge, having received notice of the death of a brother Master Mason and of his request to be buried with the ceremonies of the Craft, fixes the day and hour for the funeral (unless previously arranged by the friends or relatives of the deceased) and issues his order to the Secretary to summon (or notify) the Lodge. Members of other Lodges may be invited, but they should join with the Lodge performing the ceremonies. 4. Upon the death of a sojourner who has expressed a wish to be buried with Masonic ceremonies, the duties prescribed in Article 3 above will devolve upon the Master of the Lodge within whose jurisdiction the death occurs, unless there be more than one Lodge in the place. And if so, the funeral service will be performed by the oldest Lodge, unless otherwise mutually arranged. 5. W’henever other societies or the military unite with Masons in the burial of a Mason, the body of the de - ceased must be in charge of the Lodge having jurisdic - tion; and the services should, in all respects, be conducted as if none but Masons were present. 6. If the deceased was a Grand or Past Grand Officer, the Officers of the Grand Lodge should be invited. On Masonic Burial Service 137 such an occasion the Worshipful Master of the Lodge having jurisdiction will invite the ranking Grand Lodge Officer present to conduct the burial service. 7. The pallbearers may be Masons, when there is a procession, and should be selected by the Master, with the approval of the family of the deceased. 8. The Deacons~ and Stewards~ rods, the Tyler’s sword, and the Marshal’s baton should be trimmed with white and light blue crepe. The officers of the Lodge and Grand Officers should wear their official jewels The officers and members should wear a sprig of ever - green on the left breast. White gloves should be worn. 9. As soon as the remains are placed in the casket there should be placed upon it a plain white lambskin apron. 10. If a Past or Present Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, or Grand Warden should loin the procession of a Lodge, proper attention must be paid to him. They take place after the Master of the Lodge. Two Deacons, with white rods, should be appointed by the Master to attend them. 11. When the head of the procession shall have ar - sived at the place of interment, or where the services are to be performed, the lines should open, the highest officer in rank, preceded by the Marshal and Tyler, should pass through, and the others should follow in order. 12. When a number of Lodges join in a funeral pro - cession, the posit ion of the youngest Lodge is at the head, or right, of the procession, and the oldest at the end, or left, excepting that the Lodge of which the deceased was a member walks nearest the casket. 13. A Lodge in procession is to be strictly under the discipline of the Lodge room; therefore, no brother can enter the procession or leave it without express permis - sion from the Worshipful Master, conveyed through the Marshal. The Lodge is at labor and not at refreshment."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"F w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtin~argus.nI ~6 138 Masonic Burial Service SERVICE IN THE LODGE At the time specified, the Lodge will be opened on the Third Degree; the purpose of the communication will be stated; and remarks upon the virtues of the deceased may be made by the Worshipful Master and brethren.

Grant, we beseech Thee, eternal rest unto this our dear departed brother, and let light perpetual shine upon him. We thank Thee that in Thy loving providence Thou hast drawn him from the unreal towards the real, from the dark - ness of the West into Thy glorious light of the East, through the gates of death into the splendor of immortality. Our love and our prayers shall follow him. And through Thy loving kindness may we in deep humility and reverence become fellow workers with Thy boundless power, and may our weakness be supported by Thine infinite strength; that we, with this our dearly beloved brother, may in due time attain unto the wisdom of Thy spirit. Likewise, 0 Lord, we pray for those who are left in sorrow, those whom Thou has called to sacrifice the solace of our departed brother’s earthly presence. Do Thou, 0 Lord, comfort them with the balm of Thy loving kindness, that, strengthened by Thee and resting upon the surety ol Thy wisdom, they may be sustained and consoled in their bereave - ment.

The dead body of our beloved brother lies in its narrow house before us, overtaken by that fate which must sooner or later overtake us all, and which no power nor station, no virtue nor bravery, no wealth nor honor, no tears of friends nor agonies of relatives can avert; teaching an impressive lesson, oft repeated, yet by some forgotten, that every one of us must crc long pass through the shadow of death. SENIOR WARDEN—In the midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek succor but of Thee, 0 Lord? Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not Thy merciful ears to our prayer. JUNIOR WARDEN—Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Lord, help us to serve Thee in this ]ife, that we may enjoy Thee in the life to come. WORSHIPFUL MASTER—Where IS our departed brother? SENIOR WARDEN—Being an upright man and Mason, he should no longer dwell in darkness; so let us hope that his eyes are now opened to the Light of Eternal Life, and that he is now advanc - ing towards the Great White Lodge above.

The solemn notes that betoken the dissolution of this earthly tabernacle have again alarmed our outer door, and another spirit has been summoned to the land where our fathers have gone bebore us. Again we are called to assemble among the habi - tations of the dead, to behold the “narrow house appointed for the living.” Here, around us, in that peace which the world cannot give or take away, sleep the unnumbered dead. The gentle breeze fans their verdant covering; they heed it not. The sunshine and the storm pass over their resting place; and they are not disturbed. Stones and lettered monuments symbolize the affection of surviving friends; yet no sound proceeds from them, save that silent but thrilling admonition, “Seek ye the narrow path and the straight gate that lead unto eternal life.” We are again called upon to consider the un - certainty of human life, the immutable certainty of death, and the vanity of all human pursuits. Decrepitude and decay are written upon every living form. “But a span—a heartbeat—a breath— fall between the cradle and the grave.” What, then, are all the externals of human dig - nity—the power of wealth, the dreams of ambition, the pride of intellect, or the charms of beauty— when Nature has paid her just debt? Fix your eyes on the closing scene, and view life stripped of its ornaments, and exposed in its natural weakness; and you must be persuaded by the utter emptlness of these delusions.

Here the scepter of the prince and the staff of the beggar are laid side by side. Our present meeting and proceedings will have been vain and useless, if they fail to excite our serious reflections, and to strengthen our resolutions of amendment. Be then persuaded, my brethren, by this example of the uncertainty of human life, of the unsub - stantial nature of all its pursuits, and no longer postpone the all-important concern of preparing for eternity. Let us each embrace the present moment, and while time and opportunity permit, prepare for that great change when the pleasures of the world will be as a poison to our lips, and the happy reflec - tion consequent upon a well-spent life will afford the only consolation. Thus shall our hopes be not frustrated, nor we be hurried unprepared into the presence of that all-wise and powerful Judge, to whom the secrets ol all hearts are known. Let us resolve to main - tain with sincerity the dignified character of our profession. May our Faith be evinced in a correct moral walk and deportment; may our Hope be bright as the glorious mysteries that will be revealed hereafter; and our Charity boundless as the wants of our fellow-creatures. And, having faithfully dis - charged the great duties we owe to God, to our neighbor, and to ourselves, when at last it shall please the Grand Master of the Universe to sum - mon us unto His eternal presence, may the Trestle Masonic Burial Service 147 Board of our whole lives pass such inspection that it will be given unto each of us to “eat of the hidden manna” and to receive the “white stone with a new name” that will insure perpetual and unspeakable happiness at His right hand. The Lambskin having been removed ham the casket, the Master holds it up and says: WORSHIPFUL MASTER—The Lambskin Apron is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason, more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle, more honorable than the Star and Garter, when worthily worn. By it we are re - minded of that purity of life and conduct so es - sential for gaining admission to the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect ol the Uni - verse reigns in splendor everlasting. This emblem I now deposit in the grave of our deceased brother. (Deposits it.) The Woishiplul Master, holding he evergreen, continues: This evergreen, which once marked the tempo - rary resting place of the illustrious dead, is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. By it we are reminded that we have an im - mortal part within us, which shall survive the grave, and which shall never, never, never die. By it we are admonished that though, like our brother whose remains lie before us, our bodies too shall soon be clothed in the habiliments of death and deposited in the silent tomb; yet, through our belief in the mercy of God, we may confidently hope that our souls will bloom in eternal spring.

The Lord sitteth above the water floods; the Lord remaineth a King forever. The universe is His temple. Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty are about His throne as pillars of His mighty works; for His wisdom is infinite, His strength is omnipotent, and his beauty shines through the whole universe in order and in symmetry. The heavens He has stretched forth as a canopy; the earth He has planted as His footstool; He crowns His temple with stars as with a diadem; and from His Hands flow all power and glory.

While necessarily of a funeral character, it difiers essentially from the burial service. In the latter case we are in the actual presence of the departed, engaged in the last rites of affection and respect for one who has been our companion in life, and whose mortal remains we are about to consign to their last resting place. The Lodge of Sorrow, on the contrary, is intended to celebrate the memory of our depasted brethren. And while we thus recall their virtues, and temper anew our resolutions so to live that, when we shall have passed the salent portals, our memories may be cherished with grateful remembrance, we learn to look upon death from a more elevated point of view. We see in it the wise and necessary transition from the trials and imperfections of this world to the perfect life for which our transient journey here has been the school and the preparation. Vocal and instrumental music are indispensable to the proper effect of the ceremony. The brethren should wear white gloves and aprons. There is no necessity for secrecy in the ceremonies of Sorrow Lodges. They may be held in churches or public halls, or in the presence of friends in the Lodge rooms, with benefit to all concerned. 0 PREPARATION OF THE HALL I. The Lodge room or hall should be appropriately draped in white and light blue; and the several stations should be covered with the same colors. 2. In the center of the hall is placed the catafalque, which consists of a rectangular platform, about six feet long by four wide, on which are two smaller platforms; so that three steps are represented. On the third one should be an elevation of convenient height, on which is placed an urn. The platform should be draped in white and light blue, and a canopy of the same colors may be raised over the urn. 3. At each corner of the platform will be placed a candlestick, bearing a lighted taper; and near it, facing the East, will be seated a brother, provided with ass extinguisher to be used at the proper time. ‘l~. During the first part of the ceremonies the lights in the hall should burn dimly. 5. Arrangements should be made to increase the bril - liancy of the lights at the appropriate point in the cere - mony. 6. On the catafaique will be laid a pair of white gloves, a lambskin apron, and, if the deceased brother has held office, the appropriate insignia. 7. When the Lodge is held in memory of sevecal brethren, shields bearing their names are placed around the catafalque. After the brethren are assembled at the Lodge room, or some other convenient place, the Master of the Lodge to which the deceased brother belonged will open the Lodge on the Third Degree. A procession will then be brined to the hall where the Lodge of Sorrow is to be held, in the same order as prescribed in the “Funeral Service.” On arriving at the door of the hall where the Lodge of Sorrow is to be held, the brethren will turn alternately right and left and form two lines facing each other. The Master of the Lodge to which the deceased brother be - longed will then pass through between the lines, sup - ported by Deacons with rods, followed by the brethren in inverted order, to his station in the East. The other officers will take their usual stations and places, and the brethren will take their places in seats especially reserved for them. The door of the hall will then be shut, and not opened until the ceremony is concluded and the Lodge of Sorrow closed."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl W.StiChtingarguS.nl w.stiChtingargus.n I W.StiChtingarguS.nl w.stiChtingargus .nl W.StiChtiflgargus.fll w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus. ni w. stiChtingargus.nl W.StiChtingargus.nl W.StiChtiflgargus.nl w.

After this the Master will call up the Lodge and say: WORSHIPFUL MASTER—Brother Senior War - den, for what purpose are we assembled? SENIOR WARDEN—TO honor the memory of those brethren whom death hath taken from us; to contemplate our own approaching dissolution; and, by the remembrance of immortality, to raise our souls above the consideration of this transitory existence. WORSHIPFUL MASTER—Brother Junior War - den, what sentiments should inspire the souls of Masons on occasions like the present? JUNIOR W~DE~—Calm sorrow for the absence of our brethren who have gone before us, earnest solicitude for our own eternal welfare, and firm faith and reliance upon the wisdom and goodness of the great Architect of the Universe. WORSHIPFUL MASTER—Brethren, commending these sentiments to your earnest consideration, and invoking your assistance in the solemn ceremonies about to take place, I declare this Lodge of Sorrow opened. The chspiain will then offer the following or some other suitsbie prayer: Grand Architect of the Universe, in whose holy sight centuries are but as days and to whose om - Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow 161 niscience the past and the future are but as one eternal present, look down upon Thy children, still wandering among the delusions of time, still tremb - ling with dread of dissolution, and shuddering at the mysteries of the future. Look down, we be - seech Thee, from Thy glorious and eternal day into the dark night of our error and presumption, and suffer a ray of Thy divine wisdom to pene - trate into our hearts; that they may be filled with the brightness of Thy everlasting light, that we may cherish, amid the uncertainties of life, reliance upon Thy promises and assurance of a place at Thy right hand. Amen. Response—So mote it be. The choir w~!i then sina en spproprisse hymn. WORSHIPFUL MASTER—Brethren, in the midst of life we are in death, and the wisest cannot know what a day may bring forth. We live but to see those we love passing away into the Silent Land. Think of the brethren who, “Short days ago lived, Felt dawn, Saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved ;‘ who were among us in all the pride and power of life.

Most of us, my brethren, are fast ap - proaching, or have already passed the meridian of life; our sun is sinking in the VV’est. And, oh! how much more swift is the passage of our declining years than when we started upon the journey, and believed—as the young are too prone to believe— that the roseate hues of the rising sun of our existence were always to be continued. When we look back upon the happy days o~ childhood, when the dawning intel[ect first began to exercise its powers of thought, it seems as but yesterday, and that, by a simple effort o~ the will, we could put aside our manhood, seek again the loving caresses of a mother, and live once again the joys of child - hood. Could we now realize the idea that our last hour had come, our present earthly life would seem but as the space of time from yesterday until today. The span of three score and ten years al - lotted to man is but a twinkling in eternity. Cen - turies upon centuries have rolled away behind us; before us stretches out an eternity of years to come; and on the narrow boundary between the past and the present flickers the taper we term our life. When we came into the world, we knew naught of what had been before us; but as we caine to the years of understanding, we learned of the past. We learned what men had thought, and said, and done, from the beginning of the world to our Ritual f or a Lodge of Sorrow 163 day. But only through the eye of faith and un - derstanding can we behold what is to come here - after, and only through a firm reliance upon the Divine promises can we satisfy the yearnings of our immortal souls. The cradle speaks to us of remembrance; the casket of hope of a blessed trust in a glorious im - mortality, and a never-ending existence beyond the gloomy portals of the tomb! Let these reflections convince us how vain are all the wranghngs and bitternesses engendered by the collisions of the world; how little in dignity above the puny struggles of ants over a morsel of food or for the possession of an inch of soil. What shall survive us Not, let us hope, the petty strifes and bitternesses, the jealousies and heart-burnings, the small trials and mean ad - vantages we have gained; but rather the noble thoughts, the words of truth, the works of mercy and justice, that ennoble and light up the exist - ence of every honest man, however humble; and live for good when his body, like this remnant of humanity, is moldering in its parent dust. Let the proud and the vain consider how soon the gaps are filled that are made in society by those who die around them, and how soon time heals the wounds that death inflicts upon the loving heart. And from this let them learn humility, and that they are but drops in the great ocean of humanity."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. shichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus ni w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. shichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. shichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtin~argus. ni 164 Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow Finally, brethren, may we So live, that when our summons comes to join The innumerable caravan which moves To that mysterious realm where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death~ We go not, like the quarry-slave at night~ Scourged to his dungeon~ but sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach our grave Like one that wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams. For this, at least, man learns by death: that his calamities are not immortal. To bear grief honor - ably and temperately, and to die willingly and nobly, are the duties of a good man and a true Mason. Solemn musk may now be sung or performed. An interval of profound silence wfll be observed. Twelve strokes will be slowly sounded on the bell.

Let us look above to Him whose omniscience ruleth both life and the grave.

The Chaplain will then offer the following prayer~ OUR FATHER WHO ART [N HEAVEN, it hath pleased Thee to take from among us those who were our brethren. Let time, as it heals the wounds thus inflicted upon our hearts and upon the hearts of those who were near and dear to them, not erase the salutary lessons engraved there; but let those lessons, always continuing distinct and legible, make us and them wiser and better. And whatever distress and trouble may hereafter come upon us, may we ever be consoled by the reflection that Thy wisdom and Thy love are equally infinite. Let the loss of our brethren increase our affection for those who are yet spared to us, and make us more punctual in the performance of the duties that Friendship, Love, and Honor demand. When it comes to us also to die, may a firm and abiding trust in Thy mercy dispel the gloom and dread of dissolution.

The procession will move once round the catafalque to slow and solemn music. On arriving in the East, the procession will halt and open to the right and left. The Junior Warden will then advance to the catafalque, and, placing upon it a bunch of white flowers, will say: JUNIOR WARDEN—En memory of our departed brethren, I deposit these white flowers, emblem - atic of that pure life to which they have been called—reminding us that as these children of an hour will droop and fade away, so, too, we shall soon follow those who have gone before us; and inciting us so to fill the brief span of our existence that we may leave to our survivors a sweet savor of remembrance. The Junior Warden returns to his place and an inter - val of silence is observed. The procession is again formed, and moves as before to the sound of slow music twice around the catafalque. The brethren halt and open as before, and the Senior Warden, approaching the catafalque, will place upon it a wscath of white flowers, and say: Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow 167 As the sun sets in the West, to close the day and herald the approach of night, so one by one we lay aside our bodies. Let then these flowers be to us the symbol of remembrance of all the virtues of our brethren who have preceded us to the Silent Land; and the token of that fraternal alliance which binds us while on earth, and which we hope will finally unite us in heaven. The Senior Warden returns to his place, and an interval of silence is observed. Then procession is again formed, and moves thr’ee times around the carafsfque to solemn music as before. Arrived in the East, the Worshipful Master will advance and place upon the urn a wreath of eveigreen, and say~ It is appointed unto all men once to die, but after death cometh the resurrection. The dust shall return to the earth, and the spirit unto God who gave it. In the grave all men are equal; the good deeds, the lofty thoughts, the heroic sacrifices alone survive and bear fruit in the lives of those who strive to emulate them. While, therefore, Nature will have its way, and our tears will fall upon the graves of our brethren, let us be reminded by the evergreen, symbol of our faith in immortal life, that the spirit of man is eternal. Never the spirit was born;~ the spirit shall cease to be never; Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams; Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit forever; Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. shichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus ,nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtin~argus.nI f y 168 Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow Let us be comforted by the reflection that their memories will not be forgotten; that they will still be loved by those who are soon to follow them; that in our archives their names are written; and that in our hearts there is still a place for them. And so, trusting in the infinite love and tender mercy of Him without whose knowledge not even a sparrow falls, let us prepare to meet them where there is no parting, and where with them we shall enjoy eternal rest. ALL—The will of God is accomplished. So mote it be. Amen. The Master returns to his place, and another period of silence is observed. At this point the Chaplain may read at the altar the following. Rest in the eternal grant unto them, 0 Lord; and let light perpetual shine upon them. The righteous shall be in everlasting remem - brance; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings. Blessed is the man whom Thou choosest and receivest unto Thee; he shall dwell in Thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of Thy house even of Thy holy temple. Rest in the eternal grant unto them, 0 Lord; and let light perpetual shine upon them. But some man will say: How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain; it may chance Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow 169 of wheat or of some other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him; and to every seed his own body. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There ts a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortal ity—O death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory? As the Chaplain pronounces the concluding words, “0 grave, where is thy victory?” the fights in the Hall will he raised to brilliancy, the four brethien seated around the catafalque will relight the tapers, and the Chaplain will return to his place in the East. A suitable ode may he sung. WORSHIPFUL MASTER—My brethren, let Ma - sonry speak to us through your lips of our deceased brethren, who have gone away from us. Tell us the story of their lives, and recount their virtues, that we may remember and imitate them.

Answer these questions, as Masons should answer. SENIOR WARDER—Man judgeth not of man. He, whose infinite and tender mercy passeth all comprehension, whose goodness endureth forever, has called our brethren hence. Let Him judge. In ancient Egypt, no one could gain admittance to the sacred asylum of the tomb until he had passed under the most solemn judgment before a grave tribunal. Princes and peasants came there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted the history of their lives, and threw the penetrating light of truth upon their actions. If it were adjudged that the dead man had led an evil life, his memory was condemned in the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. But Masonry has no such tribunal to sit in judgment upon her dead. She does require, however, that whatever is said concerning them shall be the truth. And should it ever happen that nothing good can be truthfully Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow 171 said of a Mason after death, she will mournfully and pityingly bury him out of her sight in silence. WORSHIPFUL MASTER—Brethren, let us profit by the admonitions of this solemn occasion; lay to heart the truths to which we have listened; and resolve so to walk that when our summons comes, It may be the privilege of the brethren to strew white flowers upon our graves and keep us in fond remembrance. Brother Senior Warden, announce to the breth - ren that our labors are now concluded, and that it is my pleasure that this Lodge of Sorrow be closed. SENIOR WARDEN—Brother Junior Warden, the labors of this Lodge of Sorrow being now ended, it is the pleasure of the Master that it be closed. Make due announcement to the brethren, and in - vite them to assist. JUNIOR WARDEN—(calling up the Lodge) Brethren, the labors of this Lodge of Sorrow being ended, it is the pleasure of the Master that it be now closed.

Although this ceremony was part of rue Mysteries, yet ir was well known to all; as it was rounded upon the peculiar funeral rites of the Egyptians From this judgment in this world no Egyptian was exempt, no mutter how exalted his position~ and upon this trial depended the right to an honorable burial. All whom the deceased person had wronged, and all who knew af his evil deeds, were permitted to testily osar his dead body, while his friends and kindred loudly proclaimed his virtues The decision followed the weight of the evidence; and even a king who had led a bad and wickad life might be eacluded from burial in his own sepulchre. And the “assessors” at the funeral were allowed to pronounce a con - demnation, which all agreed would also be received in a future state. This trial of the dead in this world was typical of the Judgment of Amend, where Osiris pres,ded in the invisible world, and which the devout Egyptian believed took place there at the same time From this peculiar custom of the Egyptians arose a patt of the ceremonies of initiation into the Mysteries of Isis; fat, as in initiation the candidate died symbolically, so also he underwant the judgment of the dead, to ascertain ii he was worthy to receive the higher and more important secrets, by being raised and brought to light, typical ol the admission of the good into the “mansions of the blessed “ The last judgment is one of the principal subjects tound depicted upon the walls of tombs and in the “Book of the Dead,” sometimes referred to in the actual trial; at other times referred to in the enactment of the Mysteries This judgment of the dead was peculiar to the national customs and funeral rites of the Egyptians, and does not appear to have prevailed in other countries. It was, therefore, naturally discontinued as a part of the Mysteries when they were introduced into other count ries under other names. * * * * ii * There is nothing in the ancient Masonic degrees in the least analogous to the Judgment of Amenti, that portion of the Mysteries of Isis not having been adopted into the Mysteries as celebrated in other lands and at a later age. The folloseing represen - tation of the scene, taken from the “Book of the Dead.” will, however, he interesting to all readers, and members of the Fraternity will not fail to recognine in it certain Masonic features which we may not particularize, The figure seated on the throne is Osiris, ne Judge of the Dead; he holds the flail and crook, emblems of majesty and domin - ion. The deeds of the deceased, or of the candidate, typified by a vase containing his bean, are being weighed in the scales of justite by Anubis and Hocus against on ostrich feather, emblem of truth, in the opposite scale * * * Thoth (Hermes, Mercury, or the Divine Intellect) presents the result so Osirto Close by is Cerberus, or Am. mit, the “Eater of the Dead “ At the right the candidate is seen attended by the Goddesses of Truth and Jusriie The Goddess of Truth holds in her hand the emblem of eternal life; and both wear upon their heads the emblem of truth Close to Osiris is seen the tkyraux bounil with a fillet, to which the spotted skin of a leopard is suspended.

For a pattern of imitation, consider the sun, the great luminary of Nature, which, rising in the east, regularly diffuses light and luster to all within its circle, In like manner it is in your province to spread and communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your Lodge. Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high importance of Masonry; and seriously admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to practice out of the Lodge those duties which they have been taught in it, and by amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct to convince mankind of the goodness of the Institution; so that, when anyone is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows, to whom distress may prefer its suit, whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by be - nevolence. In short, by a diligent observance of the By-Laws of this Iaodge, the Constitution of Free - masonry, and, above all, the Holy Scriptures which are given as a rule and guide to your faith, you will be enabled to merit the confidence reposed in you. CHARGE TO THE WARDENS Brothers Senior and Junior Wardens (who are called up by two raps), you are too well acquainted Instituting a Lodge Under Dispensation 177 with the principles of Masonry to warrant any distrust that you will be found wanting in the discharge of your respective duties.

You are assiduously to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust, diffusing light and imparting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of the Master you will succeed to higher duties. Your acquire - ments must therefore be such that the Craft may never suffer for want of proper instruction.

It is your duty as officers and members to obey the law strictly, and in order to do so you should carefully study all of its provisions, as any de - parture therefrom may subject you to censure, or result in the recall of your dispensation. Lodges are first instituted under dispensation as a test of the ability of the officers and brethren to perform properly the duties incumbent upon them, and if, after due trial, they are found worthy and well qualified, they are constituted and formed into regular Lodges, with full power to work under charter. In addition to observing the law, it will also be the duty of the officers to conform to the rules and regu[ations of the Grand Lodge in regard to work. The Grand Lodge has its own esoteric or secret work, and Grand Lecturers to teach it; and Lodges are required to conform strictly thereto. The Mon - itor adopted by the Grand Lodge must be used, and no other. The desire on the part of Lodges under dispen - sation to confer degrees upon applicants, too often results in the admission into our Fraternity of some who are not worthy and well qualtfied. Bear in mind that the stability of a Lodge depends upon the quality of its members, and not upon the number upon whom its favors are bestowed. As Instituting a Lodge Under Dispensation 179 the strength of a chain is tested by its weakest link, so the standing of a Masonic Lodge is measured by its weakest member. I especially admonish you to inquire carefully into the character and standing of those who seek admission into our Fraternity. No man can add to or shed luster upon Free - masonry; no one shou]d be solicited to become one of us. We confer favors upon those whom we ac - cept; and we should know beyond question that the recipients are worthy of what we have to impart. I charge you to guard well the portals of this Lodge, as we have a right to know that every Free - mason you create is entitled to be greeted by the Fraternity as a friend and a brother wherever he may travel throughout the globe.

An application cannot be voted on until the lapse of four weeks after it has been referred to the committee of investigation. The fee for initiation must accompany the petition; and in every case the fee must be paid before a ballot is taken. If the applicant is rejected, the fee is re - turned. 12. The Lodge must send to the Grand Lodge its Record Book for inspection by the proper com - mittee. A copy of the Records will not suffice. 13. With reference to jurisdiction, physical qualification, etc., consult the Constitution, Gen - eral Regulations, and Edicts of the Grand Lodge of the State of Louisiana. 14. Every Lodge under dispensation must form a Code of By-Laws for its government. These By-Laws also must be sent to the Grand Lodge; but they must be entirely separate and apart from Instituting a Lodge Under Dispensation 183 the proceedings, as they go to a separate com - mittee.

On the day and hour appointed for consecrating and constituting a new Lodge, the brethren thereof will assemble in the appointed Lodge room with the Grand Lodge, which is opened in regular form. By way of preparation, It is necessary to procure an oblong box (in imitation of the Ark of the Covenant) about twelve inches high, eighteen inches wide, and twenty-four inches long, covered with white linen, as an Emblem of the Lodge. This will be set upon a small table mid-way between the altar and the East. And upon the box will be placed the Great Lights; and near it on the East, West, and South, representatives (unlighied candles) of the Lesser Lights. The Grand Master and his officers, or their represent - atives and proxies, will meet in some place convenient to the Lodge room, and the Grand Lodge will be opened. (If no such place is available, the Grand Lodge may open in the Lodge room.) The Grand Lodge then moves in procession to the hall of the new Lodge.

On such occasions, the Lodge should be opened in its hall before the public is admitted, or in an anteroom, from which it marches into the Lodge room. After the ceremonies are over it can either return to the room where it was opened, or wait until all visitors have departed, to close. The exercises may be opened with appropriale music.

The Square will teach you to regulate your actions and harmonize your conduct with the prin - ciples of morality and virtue. The Compasses will teach you to limit your desires in every station, that, rising to eminence by merit, you may live respected and die regretted. The Rule directs you to observe your duty punctually, to press forward in the path of virtue, and, inclining neither to the right nor to the left, in all your actions to have eternity in view- The Line, the emblem of moral rectitude, teaches you to avoid dissimulation in word and act; and to direct your steps to the path which leads to a glorious immortality. The Constitution and Laws you are to search at all times and cause to be read in your Lodge, that none may pretend ignorance of the excellent precepts they enjoin.

The Level teaches that we are descended from the same stock, partalce of the same nature, and share the same hope; “that we are all children of one common father, heirs of the same infirmities, and exposed to the same vicissitudes.” Although distinctions among men are necessary to preserve subordination, no eminence of station should make us forget that we are brethren, and that in the Lodge and in all our Masonic associations, we are on a Level. This implement teaches that a time will come—and the wisest knows not how soon— when all distinctions but that of goodness shall cease, and death, the grand leveler of all human greatness, shall reduce us to the same state.

The honor, reputation, and usefulness of your Lodge will materially depend upon the skill and ability with which you manage its concerns. As Master of this Lodge, it will be your especial duty to at - tend to the administration of its ceremonies, pre - serve the ancient landmarks of the Order now com - mitted to your care, and permit no innovation in the principles or rites of the Order. Upon all suitable occasions remind the brethren that Masonry is founded upon the great moral principles set forth in the sacred volume which we Annual Installation of Lodge Officers 211 receive as the rule and guide for our faith and practice. Exhort them to govern themselves by these principles, as well with the world at large as with one another. Teach them to reverence the Three Great Lights, comprehending the Holy Bible, the perfect Square, and the extended Com - passes; the beautiful symbolism of which is familiar to you, and the explanations of which include some of the most important duties inculcated in our Order. The leading objects of our Institution are to in - culcate sound morality; to make men honest and upright, true to their God and faithful to their country; and to unite them by the strong bonds of charity, friendship, and brotherly love. Great care, therefore, should be taken in the admission of members, lest by the introduction of bad material the Institution be corrupted. It should be con - stantly borne in mind that the respectability and usefulness of a Lodge do not consist in the number, but in the character, of its members. It is better that no workman be added to the roll than that one unworthy foot be allowed to cross the threshold of the Lodge. The uninitiated judge Masonry by the conduct of its individual members. You should be as careful of the reputa - tion of your Lodge as that of your family; and, as you would admit none to the society of the latter whose character is bad, so should you care - fully exclude all such from the former.

If, unfortunately, unworthy members gain admis - sion, it will be your duty to exercise proper dis - cipline, to correct abuses, and to restrain the re - fractory. UnruLy members must be reduced to order. The first risings of vice must be suppressed; and when kind and affectionate admonitions fail, the unworthy should be removed as a blot upon the Order. It is also your duty, and will no doubt be your pleasure, to spread light and impart knowledge to the brethren of your Lodge. To preserve the purity of the Order, and maintain unimpaired its rites and ceremonies, instruction is necessary. The mysteries of the Order must be unfolded and the moral duties inculcated. The minds of the brethren must be enlarged and informed. They are to be frequently reminded of the duties they owe to Almighty God, the Giver of every good and per - fect gift. They must be taught to be good men and true, to be sober, industrious, charitable, up - right in their dealings, and friendly in their social intercourse; and to live in love and peace, having consciences void of offense and unspotted from the world. Thus taught and thus acting, they will convince mankind of the value of the Institution. ~7 Annual Installation of Lodge Officers 213 When addressed, the Senior and Junior Wardens will rise.

It is your duty, therefore, to set before the brethren who surround these pillars, the corn of nourish - ment, the wine of refreshment, and the oil of joy, symbolically inculcated in the moral lessons of the Order taught from your respective stations in the Lodge. In your own persons you should give evi - dence that you are governed by the principles of the Order; as it is by a due regard for them in your own lives and conduct that you can expect obedience in others. You are to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust, diffusing light and imparting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of the Master you will succeed to the higher duties; your acquirements must, therefore, be such that the Craft may never suffer for want - of proper instruction. The spirit which you have hitherto evinced in your attendance to the duties of Freemasonry—whereby the brethren of the Lodge exetcised a sound discretion in this selec - tion—leaves no doubt that your future conduct will be such as to merit the approbation of your brethren, and that the just reward which is due for meritorious services will be rendered in your advancement to higher stations.

The officers you have chosen, and who have been regularly installed, are sufficiently acquainted with the rules of propriety and the laws of the Institution to avoid exceeding the powers with which they are intrusted. The har - mony of the Lodge will materially depend upon the good order you may preserve in the conduct of its business, and the courtesy and fotbearance you may observe toward one another in its delibera. tions. I charge you, then, as you shall answer at the last day, that you act worthy of the vocation to which you are called, and suffer no faults, no imperfections on your part, to tarnish the luster of your jewels or bring discredit upon the Craft. Recommend Masonry to the world by the rectitude of your conduct. To this end make yourselves in - timately acquainted with all its principles and obligations, and practice in your lives all its duties and requirements. Divest yourselves, brethren, of coldness and apathy, so fatal to your best interests. Shun those affections and groveling passtons un - worthy of a soul that claims affinity with the “Sons of Light ;“ and put forth all your energies to grasp whatever can reveal new and sublime ideas per - taining to our lofty destiny. Guard against dis - sensions among yourselves. Let no root of bitter- Annual Installation of Lodge Officers 215 ness spring up to trouble you. Use all your exer - tions to preserve your Lodge pure, and pr9vent the introduction of vice or error in its thousand forms. If in the frailty of mortality, a brother falls under the influence of unholy feelings and wanders into fotbidden paths, seek the wanderer out, bring him back to the fold, and point out to him the superior loveliness of virtue. We may accomplish much by the force of good example, and by offering good counsel in a friendly spirit, ever remembering that to err is human, to lorgive, divine. Finally, brethren, be of one mind; live in peace. Let nothing disturb that pure, warm, and holy love which our ritual enjoins. Follow these in - junctions and your Lodge will flourish. May the tenets of your profession be transmitted through your Lodge unimpaired from generation to genera - tion. The Installing Officer continues as follows: Brother Marshal, I now declare the several officers of Lodge No duly in - stalled into office for the ensuing year in due and ancient form. You will, therefore, prodaim the same to the brethren, that they, having due notice thereof, may govern themselves accordingly. The Marshal says: By order of the Worshipful Master, I do hereby proclaim that the officers of Lodge No are now regularly installed in their respective stations and places.

If there are more than one address, there should be musical selections between them; or one of the addresses may precede the installation, followed by a musical selection.

We look up with confidence to a brother whose person is endeared to us by that love of the Fra - ternity which is sanctified by the experience of many revolving years. May the Father of light, of life, and of love invest you with H is choicest gifts; may heavenly wisdom illumine your mind; may heavenly power give strength to your exertions; may heavenly goodness fill and enlarge your breast; may your feet rest upon the rock of justice; from your hands may streams of beneficence continually flow; and round your head may there bend a circle made splendid by the rays of honor. And, late, very late in life, may you be transmitted from the Installation of Grand Lodge Officers 219 fading honors of an earthly lodge to the mansions prepared for the faithful in another and a better world. Let me congratulate you, the Grand Officers, and other brethren, on the election of our Grand Master. As it is his duty to command according to our constitutions, so it is ours with readiness to obey. Look to the sun, and behold the planetary worlds revolving around him in continual order and harmony with the happiest effect; and learn to imitate their regularity, in the hope of obtaining from the chair of Solomon the light of wisdoffi and the warmth of love. Or look higher still, and be - hold the cherubim and seraphim, who are exhibited to us in the oracles of revelation, as flaming spirits, burning with zeal and love before the throne of God. Behold the heavenly host, filled with love of their Creator, and love for our race. See these ministering spirits, exercising their kind offices to men, relieving their wants, securing them from danger, and endeavoring to promote their good. “Myriads of spiritual beings walk the earth Unseen, or when we sleep, or when we wake.” From them let us learn to rise in our affections to the great Father of all, and thence descending, expand the heart from brother to brother, and to all mankind. From them let us learn never to be weary in well doing, but to mourn with them that mourn, and to rejoice with them that do rejoice; until, having finished our work on earth, we shall 2"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtin~argus.n1 / r 220 Installation of Grand Lodge Officers be admitted to the temple above not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

Some sisitible ode msy be sung The fohloiving or an appropriate os gins 1 oration is then delivered ORATION Brethren, the ceremonies we have performed are not unmeaning rites, nor the amusing pageants of an idle hour; but have a solemn and instructive import. Suffer me to point it out to you, and to Dedication of Masonic Halls 251 impress upon your minds the ennobling sentiments these ceremonies are so well adapted to convey. This Hall, designed and built by Wisdom, sup - ported by Strength, and adorned in Beauty, we are first to consecrate in the name oi the great Jehovah. This teaches us, in all our works, begun and finished, to acknowledge, adore, and magnify Him. It reminds us, also, in awe ol Him to enter the door of the Lodge, to put our trust in Him while passing its trials, and to hope in Him for the reward of its labors. Let, then, its altar be devoted to His service, and its lofty arch resound with His praise. May the eye which seeth in secret, witness here the sincere and unaffected piety which withdraws from the engagements of the world to silence and privacy, that it may be exercssed with less interrup - tion and less ostentation. Our march around the Lodge reminds us of the travels of human life, in which Freemasonry is an enlightened, a safe, and a pleasant path. Its tessel - lated pavement of mosaic work intimates to us the checkered diversity and uncertainty of human affairs. Our step is time; our progression, eternity. Following our ancient Constitutions, with mystic rites we dedicate this Hall to the honor of Free - masonrs-. Our best attachments are due the Craft. In its prosperity, we find our joy; and, in paying it honor, we honor ourselves. But its worth tran - scends our encomiums and its glory will outsound our praise."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"~v.stichtingargus.n~ w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w . stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nL w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.suichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w . stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stiChtingargus.nI 252 Dedication of Masonic Halls Brethren, it is our pride that we have our names on the records of Freemasonry. May it be our high ambition that they shed luster on the im - mortal page! The Hall is dedicated also to Virtue. This worthy appropriation will always be duly regarded while the moral duties which our sublime lectures inculcate, with affecting and impressive pertinency, are cherished in our hearts and illus - trated in our lives. As Freemasonry aims to enliven the spirit of Philanthropy and promote the cause of Charity, so we dedicate this Hall to Universal Benevolencer in the assurance that every brother will dedicate his affections and his ability to the same generous purpose; and that while he displays a warm and cordial affection for those who are of the Fraternity, he will extend his benevolent regards and good wishes to the whole family of mankind. Such, my brethren, is the significant meaning of the solemn rites we have just performed; for such are the peculiar duties of every Lodge. I need not enlarge upon them now, nor show how they diverge, as rays from a center, to enlighten, to improve, and to cheer the whole circle of life. Their im - port and their application are familiar to you all. In their knowledge and their exercise, may you fulfill the high purposes of the Masonic Institution. How many pleasing considerations, my brethren, attend the pleasant interview! While in almost every other association of men, political animosities, contentions, and wars interrupt the progress of Dedication of .lI/Iasonic Flails 253 Humanity and the cause of Benevolence, it is our distinguished privilege to dwell together in peace, and engage in plans to perfect individual and social happiness. While in many other nations our Fra - ternity is viewed by politicians with suspicion, and by the ignorant with apprehension, in this country its members are too much respected, and its prin - ciples too well known, to make it the object of jealousy or mistrust. Our private assemblies are unmolested; and our public celebrations atti act a more general approbation of the Fraternity. In - deed, its importance, its credit, and, we trust, its usefulness are advancing to a height unknown in any former age. The present occasion gives fresh evidence of the increasing affection of its friends; and this noble apaitment, fitted up in a style of such elegance and convenience, does honor to Free - masonry in the same measure as it reflects the high - est credit on the respectable Lodge for whose ac - commodation and at whose expense it is erected. We offer our sincerest congratulations to the Worshipful Master, Wardens, Officers, and Mem - bers of Lodge. We commend their zeal, and hope it will meet with the most ample recompense. May their Hall be the happy resort of Piety, Virtue, and Benevolence. May it be protected from accident, and long remain a monument of their attachment to Free - masonry. May their Lodge continue to flourish, their union to strengthen, and their happiness to abound.

GRAND MASTER When a visit from the Grand Master is e,cpected, the Worshipful Master will see that a convenient apartment is provided for his use and that of his Suite. When the Grand Master’s visit is announced, the Master will send the Senior Deacon, Marshal, and the Stewards with their rods, to escort him to the Lodge room. The procession will form in the following order: STe WAROS SENIOR DEAcON AND MARSHAL SUITE GRAN’O MASTER On arriving at the door, the Marshal will announce to the Tyler, ‘The Most Worshipful Grand Master of Masons of the State of Louisiana and members of his Official Family.” The Tyler will then announce to the Junior Deacon, “The Most Worshipful Grand Master of Masons of the State of Louisiana and members of his Official Family.” The Junior Deacon will make the same announcement to the Worshipful Master. The Worshipful Master will then call up the Lodge and order the Junior Deacon to admit the Grand Lodge Officers. The Stewards will enter, halt just inside the door and cross their rods.

On arriving at altar the Senior Deacon will lead his column to the left, and the Marsha] will lead his column to the right, forming a line west of the altar. As the Grand Master enters the door the Stewards will escort him to the altar (rods crossed), and the three will occupy position left for them in front of altar. The Senior Deacon will introduce the Grand Lodge Officers, in inverse order of their rank. The Worshipful Master will receive the Grand Lodge Officers according to ancient usages, with the Private Grand Honors 5 of Masonry. He will then direct the Senior Deacon to escort the Ge and Master to the East, and will invite the other Grand Lodge Officers to the East. The Worshipful Master will resign to the Grand Master the chair and gavel. The brethren are seated. Stewards do not accompany Grand Master to the East. The Grand Master may decl’ne the chair and gavel, or may accept the sante and resign them at hi, pleasure. The Private Grand Honors of Masonry are performed in a manner known only to Masons, since they can he used only in a Master’s Lodge. They are practiced by the Craft on tsve occasions: private consecration of a Masonic Hall; constitution of a new Lodge; installa - tion of a Master-elect; installation of Grand Lodge Officers; and official reception by a Lodge of an elective Grand Lodge Official. They are used at all these ceremonies as a token of congratulation and Isotnage. And as they can be given only by Master Masons, it is evident that these ceremonies must he done in the Third Degree; and that the manner ol giving the Private Grand Honors can he communi- cated only to Master Masons. They are among the things forbidden to he divulged. The Public Grand Honor,, as their name imports, do not partake of this secret character. They may be given on all public occasions in the presente of the profane as well as the initiated. They are usesi at the laying of corner.stones of public buildings, or in other services so which the ministrations of the Fraternity are required. aThe Grand Honors of Masonry are those peculiar acts and gestures by which the Craft have always been accustomed co express their homage, their joy, or their grief, on memorable occasions. They are of two kinds, private and public; they are used on different occasions. and for different purposes. Reception of Visitors 257 Should the Grand Master or other elective Grand Lodge Officer so desire, he may enter the Lodge room before the opening ceremonies and take a seat among the brethren. As soon as practicable after the Lodge is declared open, the Worshipful Master will direct the Senior Deacon to conduct the Grand Lodge Officer (or Officers) vvest of the altar; and the Senina Deacon will introduce him. Should more than one Grand Lodge Officer be present, they will be introduced in inverse order of their rank. The Lodge will be called up, the Private Grand Honors given, and the visitois invited to the East. The ranking officer should be escorted to the East~sby the Senior Deacon. The brethren are seated. All elective Grand Lodge Officers are entitled to be received in the above-prescribed manner. —0 OTHER BRETHREN Every possible courtesy should be shovsn the visitor prior to his admission, as well as afterwards; but it should be borne in mind that he has not as yet under - gone the “strict trial” or “due examination” required by Masonic law. Many jurisdictions requise the visitor to present docu - mentary evidence of his Masonic affiliation and standing; and it is well to request the visitor to exhibit any evi - dence such as diploma, certificate of membership, receipt for dues, etc. If the visitor has such a document, his signature thereon should be compased with his signature to the visitor’s register. The Lodge should have a list of regular Lodges; and the question of regularity of the visitor’s home Lodge should be verified. A committee should be appointed by the Worshipful Master to examine the visitor; and, should the prelimi - nary inspection of the documents prove them satisfactory,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"I - N.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.n w. stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .n[ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichti ngargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.n[ w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .n[ w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl 258 Reception of Visitors the committee and visitor should retire to a convenient room, where the committee should conduct such examina - tion as they deem proper, after having administered the Teat OathA’ Now follows such examination as the committee deem proper, according to the regular catechism or otherwise, in the sound discretion of the committee. It should be borne in mind that ii is not the purpose of the examina - tion to display the knowledge of the committee or of the visitor, except for the purpose of determining, “Is the visitor a Mason, duly raised in a legal Lodge, and now in good standing?” The members of the committee should avoid “prompting” the visitor, or expressing ap - proval or disapproval of his replies. Visitors should be examined separately. If not satisfied that the brother is what he claims to be, the committee should courteously inform him that, while no doubt is entestained concerning his statements as to his regularity (otherwise there would have been no examination), the committee do not feel that he has proven himself as required by the customs of Masonry. The committee should not indicate Ihe grounds for their conclusions to the visitor. “Before any stranee ansi unknown visitor can gain admission into a i’Aasonic Lodge, he is reqaired in America to take the following oath - “I, A B , do hereby and hereon solemnly and sincerely swear that I have been regularly initiated, passed, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason in a Just and legally consto ated Lodge of ssch~ that I do not now stand suspended or expelled, and know of no reason why I should not hold Masonic communication with my brethren It is called she “Tyler’s Oath” because it is usually taken in the Tyler’s room, and was formerly administered by that offiter, whose duty it was to protect the Lodge from the approach of unauthorized visitors It is now administered by the committee of esamination, and not only he to whom it is administered, but he who administers it, and all who are present must take it at the same time It is a process of purgation, and each one present, the visitor as well as the members of the Lodee, is entitled to know that all the others are legally qualified to be present at the esoteric examination which is ahour to take place Mackey—”Encyclopedia of Freemasonry.’ are cautiously to examine him, in such a method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant false pretender “ and beware of giving him any hints of knowledge”. Reception of Visitors 259 After the committee are satisfied, they will report. If the committee are ready to report before the opening of the Lodge, the visitor may take a seat with the brethren and be vouched for by the committee at the opening; and in due time be introduced. If the Lodge is open when the committee are ready to report, the Tyler will announce “The committee with a visiting brother,” when the Worahipful Master will direct the Senior Deacon to introduce the visitor. The Senior Deacon retires, is introduced to the visitor by the committee, and all return to the Lodge room and aalute at the altar. SENIOR DEAcON—Worshipful Master, I have the pleasure of introducing Brother , of Lodge No located at The Worshipful Master may call up the Lodge, and say (in substance) Brother , it gives me pleasure to introduce to you the officers and members of Lodge No , and our visiting brethren, and to welcome you to a seat among us. We meet on , and shall be very glad to welcome you to any of our meetings. The Senior Deacon conducts the visitor to a seat and the Lodge, if called up, is seated. No brother should be allowed to visit a Lodge for the first time wiihout an introduction. If the visitor is a Past Master, an officer of any Grand Lodge, or a per - manent member of the Grand Lodge of the local jus is- diction, he should be invited to a seat in the East. In some Lodges he is expected to take the proffered seat. The Worshipful Master and all members should take great care to extend the proper courtesies to visiting brethren, and to make them feel that they are welcome. The Worshipful Master may at his pleasure—and must, at the request of a member of his Lodge—invite all visiting brethren to retire from the Lodge room during the opening ceremonies."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"260 N.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.n w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .n[ w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargu s.n[ w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl Reception of Visitors AVOUCH MENT It is a rule in Masonry that a Lodge may dispense with the examination of a viaitor, if any brother preaent will vouch that he possesses the necessary qualifications. This is an important prerogative that every’ Mason is entitled to exercise; and yet it is on~ which may so materially affect the well-being of the whole Fraternity, since by its injudicious use imposters might be introduced among the faithful, that it should be controlled by the most stringent regulations. To vouch for one is to bear witness for him; and in witnessing to truth, every caution ‘should be observed, lest falsehood cunningly assume its garb. The brother who vouches should know to a certainty that the one for whom he vouches is really what he claims to be. He should know this, not from a caaual conversation, nor a loose and careless inquiry, but from ‘strict trial, due cx - amrnatien, or la’wful infos mation.” These as e the three requisites which the ritual has laid down as necessary to authorize the act of vouching. Let us inquire into the import of each. I. STRICT TRIAL. By this is meant that every question is to be asked, and every answer demanded, which is necessary to convince the examiner that the person examined is acquainted with what he ought to know to entitle him to the appellation of a brother. Nothing is to be taken for granted. Categorical an - awers must be returned to all that is deemed important to be asked; no forgetfulneas is to be excused; nor is the failure of mrmor~’ to be conaidered as a valid reason for the want of knoveledge. The Mason who is so unmindful of his obligations as to forget the instructions he has received, must pay the penalty of his carelessness; and be deprived of his contemplated visit to that society whose secret modes of recognition he baa ao little valued as not to have treasured them in his memory. The “strict trial” refers to the matter which is sought to be obtained by inquiry; and while there are some things which may safely be passed over in the investigation of one who confesses himself to be ‘rusty,” because they are details I Reeption of Visitors 261 which requite much study to acquire and constant prac - tice to retain, there are still other things of great im - portance which must be rigidly demanded. 2. DUE EXAMINATION. If “strict trial” refers to the matter, “due examination” alludes to the mode of investigation. This must be conducted with all the nrcessary fosms and antecedent cautions. Inquiries should be made as to the time and place of initiation, as a pre - liminary—the Tyler’s Oath, of course, never being omitted. Then the good old rule of “commencing at the beginning” should be pursued. Let everything go on in regular course; nor auppose that the information sought was originally received. Whatever be the suspicions of imposture, let no expression of these suspicions be made until the final decree for rejection is uttered. And let that decree be uttered in general terms, such as “I am not satisfied,” os “I do not recognize you”; and not in more specific language, such as, “You did not answer this inquiry,” or, “You are ignorant of that point.” The candidate for evamination is entitled to know only that he has not complied generally with the requisitions of his examiners. To descend to particulars is always im - proper, and often dangesous. Above all, never ask what the lawyers call “leading questions,” which include in themselves the answer; nor in any way aid the memory or prompt the forgetfulness of the pasty examined. 3. LAWFUL INFORMATION. This authority for vouching is dependent on what has been already de - scribed. For no Mason can lawfully give information of another’s qualifications unless he has himself actually tested him. But it is not every Mason who is qualified to give “lawful information.” Ignorant or unakilful brethren cannot do so; for they are incapable of discov - ering truth or of detecting error. A “rusty Maaon” should never attempt to examine a stranger; and cer - tainly, if he does, his opinion as to the result is worth nothing. If the information given is on the ground that the party vouched for has been seen sitting in a Lodge, care must be taken to inquire if it was a “just and legally constituted Lodge of Master Masons.” A person"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"N. stichtingargus .nl N.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nI w. stichtingargus. ni w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stlchtiRgarguS.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus .nI w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus .nl 262 Reception of Visitors may forget from the lapse of time, and vouch for a stranger as a Master Mason, when the Lodge in which he saw him was opened only on the First or Second Degree. Information given by letter, or through a third party, is irregular. The person giving the information, the one receiving it, and the one of whom it is given should all be present at the time; for otherwise there would be no certainty of identity. The information must be positive: not founded on belief or opinion, but de - rived from a legitimate source. And lastly, it must not have been received casually, but for the very purpose of being used for Masonic purposes. For one to say to another, “A. B. is a Mason,” is not sufficient. He may not be speaking with due caution, without expectation that his words will be considered of weight. He must say something to this effect: “I know this man to be a Master Mason, for such and such reasons, and you may safely recognize him as such.” This alone will insure the necessary care and proper obaervance of prudence. Lastly, never should an unjustifiable delicacy weaken the rigor of these rules. For the wiaest and most evident reasons, that merciful maxim of the law which says that it is better that ninety-nine guilty men escape than that one innocent man be punished, is with us reversed; so that in Masonry IT IS BETTER THAT NINETY AND NINE TRUE MEN BE TURNED AWAY FROM THE DOOR OF A LODGE, THAN THAT ONE COWAN BE ADMITTED. PREROGATIVES AND DUTIES OF THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER SELECTIONS FROM THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER’S ASSISTANT By the prerogatives of the Worshipful Master is meant the inherent right and authority he possesses by reason of the position he occupiea, giving him, as it does, extra - ordinary powers and privileges ~vhich belong to the presiding officer of no other association. He presides during the businesa as well as the work of Masonic labors of the Lodge. In all cases his decision on points of order is final in the Lodge; for it is a aettled principle of Maaonic law that no appeal can be taken to the Lodge from the decision of the Master. The Grand Lodge alone, or the Grand Maater, for the time, can overrule his declared opinion on any point of order. The prerogatives of the Worshipful Master are so numerous, so varied, and so intes woven with one another that it is as difficult to lay them out as so many threads from a tangled skein For convenience we divide them into aect ions, and couple with them some of the more important duties that devolve upon him. His duties are plainly in harmony with his prerogatives, and they will seem almost a needleas repetition; but the exercise of prerogatives and the discharge of duties should be prop - erly understood. FIRST PREROGATIVE. To congregate his Lodge in any emergency.

The Worshipful Master is the judge of the emergency that may require a special or called meeting. Without his consent, except at times for stated or regular com - munications, the Lodge cannot be convened or congre - gated; and any business transacted at a special com - munication without his sanction is illegal and void.~ FIRST DUTY. To attend regularly the communica - tions of his Lodge. This duty is so plain as hardly to need a comment. Few things weaken and demoralize the Lodge as much as the Master’s frequent absence; and there are few things that more thoroughly justify the Lodge in appealing to the Grand Master to have him removed from office and his place filled by the Senior Warden. The Master should be in the Lodge room from a half to a quarter of an hour before the time for opening, to see that the Tyler is at his post and everything is in readiness for the proper conduct of the business of the Lodge. If visitors are in attendance, the Worshipful Master is ready to meet them with the genial “word of welcome” so acceptable to the stranger. w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nI w. stichti ngargus.nI w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nI w.stichti ngargus .nl w.stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus .n I SECOND PREROGATIVE. To preside at all com - munications of his Lodge. This is a self-evident proposition, and follows as a natural consequence of his installation. There is this peculiarity attached to the Master of a Masonic Lodge: After being duly installed, he cannot resign; nor can he be deprived of his right to preside by any power residing in the Lodge itself. He is bound “to pay homage to the Grand Master for the time being, and to the Grand Officers when duly installed.” Hence, when the Grand -‘I! Worshipful Master—Prerogatives, Duties 265 Master, or his Deputy, or other duly appointed repre - sentative of the Grand Master appears in the Lodge, the right of the Master to preside temporarily disappears, unless the superior authority waive the right. The Worshipful Master may, and sometimes will, call upon an experienced Brother or Past Master to preside; but he is all the time responsible to the Grand Lodge for the proceedings, as much so as if he held the gavel in person. He may resume the East at any moment, at his discretion. In case of his absence or absenting himself after the opening of the Lodge, he must surrender charter, gavel, and prerogative to the Senior Warden, or in the latter’s absence to the Junior Warden, or close the Lodge. SECOND DUTY. To open his Lodge at the time specified in the By-Laws, and close it at a suitable hour. No clock is more punctually to sound forth the hour with its hammer than a well-disposed Worshipful Master is to sound with his gavel the hour and moment of open - ing the Lodge. After he has done this, if there is not a sufficient number to open the Lodge, it is optional with him to wait for others or dismiss those who are present. There is nothing more discouraging than the tardiness of the Worshipful Master in opening the Lodge. Care - lessness and indifference on his part beget the same in the members. He is the sole judge of the time to close the labors; but the Lodge should be closed at a proper hour. The ability ol the Worshipful Master is shown in his manner of opening and closing the Lodge. THIRD PREROGATIVE. To select all appointive officers and to fill temporarily all vacancies that may occur in the Lodge offices, unless otherwise provided by the Constitution and By-Laws. Every officer should be selected with special regard to his fitness for the position he is to occupy. This is especially true of the Senior Deacon, who is the proxy, the assistant, the executive of the Worshipful Master, as the Worshipful Master is the embodiment of the Lodge"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"N.Stichtingargus.nl ~v.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI 266 J’Porshipful Master—Prerogatives, Duties itself. He is the active, forward personage in the drill and drama. How important then that the Worshipful Master make a cautious selection in this particular case. As it is the duty of the Worshipful Master to “set the Craft to labor,” it is necessary that he have the active co-operation of all the officers; and ii any are absent, he has full power to select from the brethren present such as he may deem competent to discharge the duties. There is no advancement by right. If the Senior Warden is absent, the Junior Warden does not ex-officio fill the West. The Worshipful Master appoints a Senior Warden pro tem. THIRD DUTY. To preserve order in the Lodge. His very name, Master, suggests the authority to keep order. The Gavel, the implement placed in his hands when he was installed, is an emblem of power and control; and if properly wielded, will insure cheerful obedience and secure perfect order and decorum. FOURTH PREROGATIVE AND DUTY. To regu - late the admission of visitors. One of the most important duties of the Worshipful Master is the preservation of harmony among the breth - ren by the exercise of sleepless vigilance against the ad - mission of cowans; or of those brethren who, if admitted, would by their presence disturb the peace of the Lodge and hinder its work. In the discharge of this duty the Worshipful Master should exercise his prerogative and refuse admission to any visitor whose presence would be objectionable to any member. It would be a poor incen - tive to peace and harmony to admit a living cause of offense. w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nI w. stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichti ngargus .nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargus .n I FIFTH PREROGATIVE. To control and terminate discussions. This right is not to be exercised in a haughty, arbi - trary, or dictatorial manner, but with the determination to administer impartial justice; to the end that the peace and harmony of the Lodge be preserved and its Worshipful Master—Prerogatives, Duties 267 prosperity secured. This prerogative is a landmark, essential to the position of the Worshipful Master, the only method by which he can sustain himself in his responsibility to the Grand Lodge, and, happily for his position, one that will rarely bring him in conflict with his brethren; for the good sense of obedience inculcated in every degree of Masonry will bend the minds of the brethren to support the Worshipful Master in a judicious exercise of power. There is little or no danger of rebel - lion, even in extreme cases. FIFTH DUTY. To use his utmost endeavors to pre - serve peace and harmony in the Lodge; and by his deportment, both in the Lodge and out of it, to be a good example to his brethren. The Masonic student will find nowhere a finer com - ment upon this passage than the well-known Charge at Installation of the Worshipful Master. With slight changes, it reads: “Impress upon the members of your Lodge the dignity and high importance of Masonry. Admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to practice out of the Lodge those duties which they have been taught in it. By amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct convince mankind of the goodness of the Insti - tution; so that when any one is said to be a Freemason, the world may know that he is one to whom the brother - hood may pour forth its sorrows, to whom distress may prefer its suit, whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence.” SIXTH PREROGATIVE AND DUTY. To be the custodian of the Charter of the Lodge, and transmit it to his successor. At his installation the Worshipful Master receives in charge the Charter of the Lodge. Under its authority alone can the Lodge be organized; its presence is neces - sary to the legality of all meetings; and it follows that the powers of the Master can be exercised only under its sanction. It is therefore but just that he at all times be in possession of the evidence of his authority. He should carefully preserve it, and transmit it to his successor in office."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"5 v.stichtingargus.nl 5 v.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichti ngargus.n I w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nI w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichhingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.shichtingargus .nl 268 Worshipful Master—Prerogatives, Duties SEVENTH PREROGATIVE. To determine all ques - tions of order and the Order of Business. If a Master is competent to fill the station he occupies, he is the best judge of what to do and when to do it. His decisions should not be made in such manner as to call forth criticism or opposition, but to secure the best results for the Lodge. He should remember that the “good of Masonry in his Lodge” is in his keeping; and that he alone is responsible to the Grand Lodge for the good order, peace, and harmony of his brethren. SEVENTH DUTY. To perform the ritualistic work of the Lodge and instruct the brethren therein. The Masonic drama presents a beauty and sublimity calculated to arouse a desire for excellence in every intelligent mind. Nothing outside the Holy Scriptures is so grand, solemn, and sublime as the dramatic lessons which make up the theory of a Freemason’s life. To each ceremony there is a sequence that explains the preceding and hints at the subsequent passage. In each symbol is a practical thought that binds together in perfect harmony; and each points to higher attainments in the present life and a trust for a place in the world of bliss to come. Each suggests, in some degree, that kindness to our fel - lowmen is a means of pleasing God; and that pleasing Him is the highest source of human happiness. Is not the place of hierophant of such mysteries a desirable one? Does it not arouse the mind of the Worshipful Master to display these mysteries worthily? Can the man who is covenanted and installed under most sacred sanctions allow his indolence to justify his ignorance? EIGHTH PREROGATIVE. To appoint all com - mittees. Being responsible for the proper conduct of the affairs of the Lodge, it is but just that the Worshipful Master have the selection of all committees, unless otherwise provided by the By-Laws. If such were not the case, the Master would, to some extent, be under the direction of the Lodge, a position in which he can never be law - fully placed. Worshipful Master—Prerogatives, Duties 269 EIGHTH DUTY. To cause an investigation into all un-Masonic conduct committed by persons affiliated with his Lodge and non-affiliates and members of other Lodges residing within his jurisdiction. The Junior Warden, who usually acts as the party to present and prosecute before the Lodge all misconduct that comes under the head of “un-Masonic conduct” acts only as the proxy of the Worshipful Master, who counsels him at every step. The good name of the Institution must be preserved; and the Worshipful Mas - ter must exercise a carelul supervision over the actions of the brethren, to see that the laws of Freemasonry are not violated and that all the brethren “come under the tongue of good report.” NINTH PREROGATIVE. To order the issuance of notifications to members. The distinction between “Notification” and “Summons” is so great that it is strange how many overlook it. The former issues from the Worshipful Master or the Lodge, and is in effect a strong invitation. It is at the option of the brother receiving it to attend the meeting or not, as he pleases. But a “Summons” comes directly within the limits of his obligation; and for its neglect he may be disciplined and punished. To disobey a summons is a serious Masonic offense. NINTH DUTY. To visit the sick, and preside at the funeral rites of deceased Masons. If it is the duty of the private Mason “to visit the sick and afflicted” affiliated with him in Masonic bonds, how much greater the duty of an installed officer? How much greater the duty of an installed Master? In this country the custom of Masonic funerals is so general that it has become a familiar sight. The burial privilege is so dear to every Mason’s heart and so con - ducive to harmony and love among members, that the Worshipful Master, knowing that death’s shafts fall indiscriminately and without warning, will not permit a month to pass after his installation before qualifying —‘9"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"N. stichtingargus .nI v.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus ni w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nI w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl 270 Worshipful Master—Prerogatives, Duties himself for the solemn duty, “The Masonic Burial of the Masonic Dead.” TENTH PREROGATIVE. To cast the deciding vote in case of a tie; provided, however~ that he can vote only once. This prerogative is limited to votes taken viva voce or by upraised hands. The Worshipful Master may vote upon ordinary ques - dons or not, as he chooses; but it is not usual for him to do so. Upon questions requiring the ballot he must always vote. In ordinary questions, if there is a lie, he should settle the question by his vote; but his prerogative does not extend to cases where the ballot is employed. ELEVENTH PREROGATIVE. To sign all drafts upon the Treasurer for the payment of Lodge disburse - ments, by order of the Lodge. Nor may the Treasurer lawfully pay out the funds without such order. It is usual to give the Worshipful Master authority to appropriate, in emergent cases of charity, small sums, without taking “the consent of the Lodge”; but for all other disbursements the treasury of the Lodge can be opened only by Lodge order. TWELFTH PREROGATIVE. To represent the Lodge in Grand Lodge. If there were no other advantages in the Grand Lodge Communications than “the making of Masons better acquainted with one another,” all the trouble, time, and expense associated with them would be justified. Friend - ships are established there, lasting as life. Hearts are bound together there that would otherwise move in widely separated circles. Innovations are frowned down; errors are adjusted; appeals are adjudicated; Masonic light is disseminated; peace and harmony are established through the utmost bounds of the jurisdiction, by the influence of Grand Lodge Communications. Worshipful A’Iaster—Prerogatives, Duties 271 THIRTEENTH PREROGATIVE. To install his Successor. In exercising this prerogative the retiring Master may give wholesome advice to his successor, pointing out his duties and enlarging upon the good things a faithful officer may accomplish. He can warn him of shoals over which he may have passed and caution him against mistakes that only experience will develop. He can encourage him and his brethren to persevere in the good work, admonishing him that with trust in God, confidence in his oflicers, consideration and love for his brethren, he may reasonably expect success and honorable service in the office to which he is installed. There are many other prerogatives, and we suggest the following for thought and consideration: To control the minutes, so far as to see that nothing improper to be written is recorded; and, on the other hand, that nothing essential to a fair record of the proceedings is omitted. To refuse to initiate a candidate, notwithstanding his acceptance by the Lodge, if, in his judgment, such initia - tion would be improper. To discuss all questions without regard to the parli - amentary etiquette of leaving the chair; because it is his duty at all times to give the Craft good and wholesome instruction. To be exempt from trial by his Lodge. The Grand Lodge alone has penal jurisdiction over him."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"N.stichtingarguS .nl v.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.n I w. stichti ngargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichti ngargus.nl w.sUchtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichti ngargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargu s .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl LODGE JEWELS.

These are the festival of St. John the Baptist on the 24th of June, and that of St. John the Evangelist on the 27th of December. They are days set apart by the Fraternity to worship the Great Architect of the Universe, to implore His blessings upon the great family of mankind, and to partake of the feast of brotherly affection. Hence it is recommended that every Lodge annually cele - brate one or bolh of these days in such a way as will be most conducive to the advantage of the Lodge, and the honor and benefit of the Institution."}]
