(One of the Founders) FOREWORD HISTORY (Funk & Wagnalls Standard College Dicnonary—1968) is “that branch of knowledge concerned with past events” It is unfortunate that so many books, pamphlets, and papers which appear under the guise of history are compiled by persons whose knowledge of the events they impute is blended with personal wishful thinking and incongruous material. This dilutes in many cases, and adds in others, the advent of the subject treated and often warps simple facts by depicting them way beyond the importance they merit. In the present case I am fully aware of what took place at the forma - tion, and subsequently, of the organization of which I write, being one of the three living founders out of an original twenty-one brethren who in - stituted The Allied Masonic Degrees in the United States of America in 1932. In extended form, the advent and continuance of the Order may be found in the official Proceedings, called ANNALS, which have been printed by the Grand Council covering the last thirty-nine years Unlike many Masonic groups whose history I have compiled, this one entertains no laborious research. It is simply a digested record compiled by the use of ANNALS. In doing so more detail will be used for the first few years as these formative years cover the period less known to our brethren. In other words, how we came Into being and proceeded along the line to the present day—minus unimportant activities and details of small interest to the present membership. It is not embellished with biographies, Masonic or otherwise, of the principals involved as such material may be easily found elsewhere (some in ANNALS) All were or are well known Masonic brethren and members of Grand and other Masonic bodies The statistical materials compiled are to give a sort of picture of the progress of the Allied Masonic Degrees here but current ANNALS program a lot of this too, which is not repeated here What is shown is to give a composite view of the membership, as the Order advanced in our Masonic system."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE ALLIED MASONIC DEGREES The following “HISTORICAL FOREWORD” is to be found in the first issue of ANNALS, printed in 1933 HISTORICAL FOREWORD The idea which was later to develop into the founding of The Graiid Council of The Allied Masonic Degrees of The United States of America had its inception in the mind of R. .E. Companion J. Ray. Shute, II, of Monroe, North Carolina. R ~.E. .Coinpanion Shute holds a Commission from the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland as Third Grand Principal by virtue of his being their Representative near the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of North Carolina. In the year 1930 he began correspondence with R..E George A Howell, Grand Scribe E., of the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland relative to the Degree of Excellent Master which is worked in Royal Arch Chapters in Scotland A ritual of this degree was sent to him for study and observation. Struck with the beauty and significance of the degree, R. E. .Com - panion Shute discussed with his close friend and Companion in Masonic work and study, E Companion Walter C Crowell of Monroe, the advisabil - ity of securing permission to confer this degree within the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of North Carolina Permission was secured from M .E Claude S Chamberlain, Grand High Priest in North Carolina, to request dispensation from Scotland for this purpose In the Spring of 1931, His Lordship, the Earl of Cassillis, First Grand Principal of the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland, granted Dispensation for this degree to be conferred in the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of North Carolina. This was the beginning of the idea that was later to develop into the founding of The Grand Council of The Allied Masonic Degrees. Immediately on receiving the Dispensation, these two Companions, both Past High Priests of Monroe Chapter No. 64, R. A. M, called together other Past High Priests of this Chapter and began the perfecting of the ritualistic work. E. Companion K. W. Parham, of Raleigh, was requested to secure two others to fill, with himself, the stations of Captains of the Veils. The Apron. Cordon and Jewel as well as the Working Tool of the Degree were prepared in Monroe and are still preserved as mementoes. Membership cards were printed especially for this occasion by E Companion Frank M Pinnix at Oxford, N. C The Degree was conferred upon approximately 200 Royal Arch Masons within the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of North Carolina in the Masonic Temple, Asheville, N. C, May 12, 1931, by a team consisting of the follow - ing Companions J. Ray Shute, II, as R. W and E Master; J Ed Stewart, as Senior Warden; Walter C Crowell, as Junior Warden; and Junius S Stearns, as Inner Guard, all Past High Priests of Monroe Chapter, No. 64. R. A. M., and the following Companions as Captains of the Veils John H Anderson. Phoenix Chapter. No. 2, P. G. H P; William R. Smith, Raleigh Chapter, No. 10, P. G H. P.; K. Webster Parham, Raleigh Chapter, No. 10, D. D. G. H. P. The Degree was received with enthusiasm and a number of Companions began to speculate on just how the Degree could be retained in America without interfering with the established Royal Arch customs. This led Com - panions Shute and Crowell to speculate on the advisability of securing the Degree from Scotland to be placed within the body of a separate organiza - tion along with other degrees controlled in Scotland by the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FOUNDERS ( MASON] Thus was it decided to discuss this matter with other deeply interested Royal Arch Masons in North Carolina and several informal group meetings were held The result was an inquiry to the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland to ascertain if they would issue Dispensations and Charters for the formation of three Lodges of Royal Ark Mariners and Councils of Red Cross Knights, both to be joined with the Excellent Master as well Much correspondence followed R E .George A Howell, Grand Scribe E., of the Supreme Grand Royal Chapter of Scotland, communicated with the Grand High Priest of the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of North Carolina and with the General Grand High Priest of the General Grand Chapter, ascertaining that there was no objection to the movement on the part of either, since the degrees in question form no part of the Royal Arch System in the United States This being true the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland agreed to entertain applications from the three groups formed in North Carolina for Dispensations and Charters, for the specific purpose of founding a Graiid Council of Allied Masonic Degrees to control these and other detached Masonic Degrees in the United States, with the proviso that the three bodies thus formed would meet in convention and form a governing body for the United States of America as early as possible after receiving Charters. With this understanding petitions were forwarded A tragedy was to occur, though, to retard the completion of these plans. Excellent Companion Walter C Crowell, who was one of the petitioners and had been proposed as Senior Warden in the Body to be formed m Monroe, received his final summons on January 2, 1932, and the sad duty of accompanying his remains to their last resting place was the lot of his co-workers Thus passed one who would have borne Serial No 2 on our rolls and one whose Masonic Record in quiet achievement is equalled by few and excelled by none. His enthusiasm for the Royal Craft, his wise counsel and keen vision played a large part in the preliminary plans of this Grand Council. This caused some delay but finally R. E Companion Shute was ob - ligated by special authority from Scotland and received Warrant of Author - ity to confer the degrees on other petitioners in North Carolina Groups had been formed at Raleigh and Charlotte and the petitioners were duly invested with the degrees. Charters were granted at the Annual Meeting of the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland on March 21, 1932, for Lodges of Royal Ark Mariners and Councils of Red Cross Knights as follows St. Andrew’s in America No. I-A, Monroe, N C, Cassillis No 2-A, Raleigh, N. C; Howell No. 3-A, Charlotte, N. C. These Lodges and Councils were duly consecrated and a call was issued for a Convention of the three Bodies for the purpose of forming The Grand Council of The Allied Masonic Degrees of The United States of America. The Convention was held in the City of Salisbury, N. C., April 16, 1932, and the Grand Council formed R E. Companion J. Ray. Shute, II, the real founder of the moveoienr, was elected to serve as first Grand Master of the Grand Council.

Althotigh Ray knew that Truman was an Honorary Member he probably did not tealize that he had been made a Knight Grand Cross at the same time the year before Anyway, Ray made stire that his colleague (both being Past Grand Masters of the Grand Lodge of Missouri) be properly decorated. Variotis adjtistments in the operation of Grand Council, of no histori - cal moment, were enacted and Ray V Denslow of Missotiri was elected Grand Master. During Biother Denslow’s Grand Mastership in Grand Council he reported two things which riled him up extensively The first was that some unfriendly brethren not member of A M D has stated that those who con - ducted otir organization were operating a Masonic racket.” He replied to this charge by listing the names proported to have been thus operating- - sixteen, including the writer—and then said “So far as we know, not one of the above has ever received one penny in compensation for the work per - formed in carrying on the organization We wonder whether those who make charges could present such a record 9 ” The second matter was the “Invasion of Jurisdiction.” The example cited was that a Canadian Royal Ark Mariner Lodge in Windsor, Ontario, were taking candidates from the United States in large numbers (65 on Sept. 9, 1944). All the documents covering this situation, which was apparently cleared up, will be found in the 1947 ANNALS (pages 12 & 13).

Consequently only a few items will be recorded 1952 to date. The lists of Grand Masters and other Officers of Grand Council are printed yearly in the ANNALS and these data can easily be constilted On August 5, 1955 our Grand Secretary, W Hugh Halliburton passed away and Grand Master Earl B DeIzell appointed Levon M Ogltikian of North Carolina to handle the position At the Grand Communication of February 18, 1956, he was elected our Grand Secretary We note in the statistics attached to the 1956 ANNALS that Brother Oglukian is listed as the Representative of the Grand Council of England, Wales, etc Aettially he received his Commission of appointment on October 1, 1956 In the 1955 ANNALS the names of Clarence J West and the writer were left out of the List of Grand Crosses, btit they were restored the following year. ‘V —1 t—"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"On February 22, 1955 Brother Halliburton wrote a letter to President Eisenhower, congratulating him on his efforts to bring peace to the world. His reply, dated February 28th, and a replica of his signature is on page 18 of the 1955 ANNALS. In 1953 and 1954 the Committee on History—Brothers Scully, Cummings and CaIdwell reported that they were working on a History of Grand Council In the 1952 issue of MISCELLANEA and the 1953 issue two histories appeared marked Parts 1 and It (they were actually printed at later dates than assigned to the issues). They are headed as written by Brother Scully The point I mention here is that they are not what their titles say they are They contain the information about the Sovereign College of Allied Masonic and Christian Degrees—and are very nicely done, too. The material was taken from the voluminous records, minutes and date of this body which was printed in MISCELLANEA of Volume 1], 1936-37 & 38 At the meeting of Grand Council in Washington, D C on February 23, 1957, the Grand Master, William L Cummings, in his address, called attention that this was the 25th. meeting and noted that Grand Council had now outgrown its swaddling clothes.” We were advised that our Grand Representative in England, Brother Arthur William Dentith, had passed away on January 11, 1957. There seems to be no record of the appointment of a new Grand Representative but the Grand Secretary mentioned Lt. Col. J W Chitty. the Grand Secretary of the Grand Council in England as our Grand Representative in 1958 He appears to have been made a Grand Cross by our Grand Council in that year Congratulations were extended to Dr and Mrs Cummings who were celebrating their FIFTIETH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. There were 223 members registered at the meeting and but three Councils having no representation. A membership list of all A M.D. members, by Councils, with addresses, a t so the Constitution and By-Laws were in the 1957 ANNALS In 1958 the writer installed Carl Frank Wood of Virginia as Grand Master This was my first such act In 1964 I installed the Grand Master— William E Yeager of Pennsylvania and have done so every year sincc, making a total of nine times The List of Grand Crosses had an indicator in front of the names of Brothers Brain, Crossle, Dentith, Record and West as “unaffiliated”— they were deceased. These marks were continued until 1964 when a new system of listing Grand Crosses was adopted by Brother Oglukian—those living in one group and those deceased in another Things went along for the remaining years at a slowly progressive rate. Not much is recorded outside of routine matters—with an item or two to break the monotony The Grand Council of A M D by this time had be - come the nucleus around which the other small groups met at the February meetings in Washington. It has fulfilled that function nicely. The gathering brought together—in the flesh—authors, writers, editors, students, scholars, and authorities in the Craft from all over the United States, who might never meet in person in any other way. Another milestone was reached at the twenty-eighth meeting in 1960. Brother Oglukian reported current assets (in real cash) of $5,436.08— being the first time we went into the ‘five grand” bracket. Also, at the same time, our membership went over a thousand (1015) It seems that when we “shed our diapers” as so ably put by Grand Master Cummings three years before, we began to romp.

In 1952, when W. Hugh Halliburton was Grand Secretary the Finance Committee noted that no money was ever allotted to the incubants of that office as salary or honor - arium and suggested that, until future allotments be set after investigation of a suitable amount. The matter was put to vote and passed with “one dissenting.” I bring this up because it was the only time I really became incensed at an open meeting of Grand Council, during which I practically begged the individual who cast the dissenting vote not to do so. He insisted that the work of the Grand Secretary be “a labor of love”. However, at the 1953 meeting a report was made suggesting that the Grand Secretary- Treasurer be allotted $150 for expenses and an honorarium of $250.00 per annum It was unanimously approved These amounts continued until Brother Halliburton passed away and Brother Oglukian was elected to the office. It still continued until 1958 when it was brought to the attention of Grand Council that Brother Oglukian was only using part of the money. So, it was then voted to give him $500 per annum to cover all expenses. in 1960 Grand Council suggested that unless he take the amounts allotted to him something would be done to compensate him. At the meeting in 1961 Grand Master Bruce H. Hunt, in his report, told the Grand Council that a committee had made a presentation of a beautiftil epergne to “Levon and Ruth Oglukian on Christmas Eve of 1960.” At the 1965 meeting Brother Oglukian reported that we had grown to 59 Councils and had t273 members, and a total of $8,251 61 in our cash balance. It was his last report. He passed away on June 26, 1965 and at the 1966 meeting, Robert L. Grubb of North Carolina was elected Grand Secretary-Treastirer. Everyone knows that a Grand Secretary of a Grand Body of Free - masonry is the most important officer holding office In fact he runs the organization for the most part We have had seven Grand Secretaries during the thirty-nine years of our existence. Parham—9 years, Harding—i year; Allen—S years: Alexander—2 years, Halliburton—5 years, Oglukian—l 1 years; and Grubb—6 years I had much to do with all of them, but I must mention that during the incumbency of Levon Mardiros Oglukian, that those who attended the eleven meetings when he sat at his station, saw the friendly rivalry between him and the writer—I am sure with considerable pleasure. One would never know, if only what was said was recorded, that we were bosom friends. We often brought up things of no particular moment but extended them into momentous proportions, with neither of us ending a “winner.” In his first report in 1955 as Acting Grand Secretary he said “A Secretary should not speak but write, should not be heard but read” We were, as the years rolled by, glad to note that he did not stick to this admonition, for he always had things to say, and he said them, too In his next report he said “Ordinarily, even though the American Language is acquired by me and not born in it, I have no trouble of finding words.” This was before he lauded the Brethren who had helped him He made many such remarks during his years in office. In a MEMORIAM to his memory by Past Sovereign Grand Master Murray C. Alexander, the latter said that Levon was “A Man, Masonic Scholar, Loving Husband and Father, and a Christian Gentleman.” Most of us are less—he was more. I had the happy privilege of being recommended by Sovereign Grand Master C. Wallace Jackson to be Levon’s successor as the Grand Represen - tative of the Grand Council of England, Wales, etc. and thus, in 1965, received that honor. For many years we have had history committees appointed in Grand Council. Year after year they made reports of a few lines. Nothing of historical nature ever emanated from these committees (except the two re - I —13—"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ports made by M V. Brother Scully mentioned previously). In 1968 a five member committee came into being with Past Grand Master C. Wallace Jackson as Chairman. Two additional members were added during the year A short report was issued in 1969 and the Chairman was beginning to accumulate material, but in 1970 his work was interrupted by an accident which took the life of our Brother William Lee Ramsey and seriously in - jured his wife, Brother Jackson’s wife, and himself. Happily, the survivors are slowly improving At this point I agreed to take over the writing of a history of the Grand Council, provided that I might do it my way. The reason for this is well stated by Brother Allen E. Roberts, who was added to the committee in 1969, when I was He said, in a letter to the Chairman, “I never believed in a Committee writing a book This usually ends in disaster” This is my view too. I have had a number of experiences which would back up this statement, the foremost of which was a five year job on The Committee on History of the Supreme Council, A A.S.R. of the Northern Jurisdiction It ended up by my writing the history privately, myself. The present undertaking I have done in a week—alone It is not sub - mitted as a committee project. It is simply a rather extensive recording of how we got started and some additional data, mostly covering the early years of Grand Council As I stated, after reviewing the first twenty years of our existence, not much of what transpired was of any great moment— historically. A listing of all our Grand Masters, other Officers, Committees is available in current ANNALS Those of the last twenty years or so have handled their jobs in accordance with good Masonic practice and is hardly history to our present membership, for whom this is really written We now have a “going organization and I predict that it will continue that way As I look back was first elected on of General Purposes year terms until 1 961. the Committee on Ti ing folders—also 29 for many years and man In 1956 I bec~ getting this pubticati~ I hope I will be Council in this rehe¶ help bragging a bit a, the Masonic Map an forty years ago woi country That is, the Edward Allen, and As a final tribut Yes, North Cat were born in the U mond Shute, II of lvi into lanes, then streel Not only did Knight Masons of (C.B.C.S); The Gra] Red Branch of En, Templar Priests; an~ which now meet in where The Societm Masonic Order of th North Carolina not elsewhere equall C In U.S.A. for Englar 1935—Kennon Web~ 1950—W.
