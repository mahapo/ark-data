Its degrees are conferred—never communicated, believing that ifs degree is worth anything at all it is woith the effort neces - sary to confer it Your Masonic education will nor depend so much upon kow many degrees you may receive, but upon how well you understand and practice those you have ieceived Freemasonry a School The York Rote of Freemasonry may be likened to a school. When you have received the three craft degrees of the lodge, you have received the ‘Three Ra.” By advancing you rake up the high school and college courses of the fraternity There is nothing more inteirsting, more tragic, nor more edu - cational than the periods of history which furnish the back - giound for the chapter and council degrees, and in the tom - mandery is brought to light not only some of the old Jew - ish history, but the principles enunciated by the Greal Teacher who gave to the world the New Dispensation of Love, Trutli~ and Toleration—those virtues most needed in the world to - day. Once there was a time when all of what is known as Free - masonry was contained in one degree This was followed by a natural development resulting in a system of degrees known as Enteied Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason In the latter degiec was a beautiful tradition explaining much of the I Masonic symbolism But when two rival grand lodges in Eng - land united more than a century ago, a vital and essential part of the third degree was removed and placed in a degree known as the Royal Arch The Mother Grand Lodge was confronted with a large series of degrees and rites which it regarded as supesfiunus, causing it to make the following official edict Ancient Craft Masonry consists of three degrees and no more, namely, those of the Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, including the Holy Royal Arch” Thus did the Mother Grand Lodge set out Royal Arch Ma - sonry as something to be attained by those who were interested in Masonic advancement Why? Because in Royal Arch Ma - sonry is found the essentials of symbolism and philosophy nec - essary for a Master Mason to understand that which he has re - ceived only in part I There is nothing higher in Freemasonry than the Royal Arch, When you have attained that degree you will have at- tamed by regular gradations to the summit of the Royal Art. While the degrees of the Council will assist you in the under - standing of the chapter degrees, they are not regarded as su - perior degrees Nor is the Order of the Temple a higher Order It is intended only to explain the Chsistian interpretation of the Maso’~ic system You may attain or receive other degrees and orders, but in the attainment of the Boyal Arch degree you have reached the summit of Ancient Craft Masonry 9"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Why Take Addt:tonal Degrees? You learned early in your Masonic career that Freemasonry was a progressive science By the word progressive is meant advancement The statement means that one who is a Free - mason should never be satisfied to remain in a static condition, but that he should take every opportunity for self-improvement There are individuals, few in number, who proclaim that all Freemasonry is bound up in the system of three degrees To all these we would answer in the words of one of our friends, now deceased “To the same extent, it may be said that everything that ecists may be found in drab, old Mother Earth All the stately tiers of our majestic forests come from the drab earth, but you would have difficulty in finding them there Moreover, if you did find them there you would have them only in their com - ponent, prosaic elements, and not as you find them ‘round about us, in all their beauty The wonderful flowers that delight the eye with their color and their foliage, and fill the air with their fragrance, came from the unattiactive earth There is no ele - mint of theirs that does not come from there, but if found, it would not attract the eye, or spread its delic ate scent abroad, be - cause to do so there must have been a transformation of the commonplace mb the elaborate and beautiful ‘Every word in the English language is to be found in our alphabet of twenty-six letters You may remember them all, be able to repeat them by rote, forward and backward, or by start - ing in the middle and going in either direction, but, if so, what knowledge would you have of the beauty of literature?” We do not belittle the three craft degrees in making such a statement, for these degrees are the foundation—they are in fact indispensable They are to Freemasonry what reading, writing, and aicthmetcc are to the sludent—the basis for such studies as astronomy, geography, mathematics, science and the arts, which have been instrumental in raising man’s standards of knowledge The Degree of Itlark Master The opening degiee of the Royal Arch Chapter ii highly regarded by Masonic itudenti and ritualists as being one of the most beautiful degrees in all Freemasonry, teaching lessons which have proved of value in all walics of life The scene of the degree ci laid in one of the workshops erected near King Solo - mon’s Temple, and the candidate is taught many interesting historical facts, as well ai given practical demonstrations of the value of Honesty and Charity. The Jewish half-shekel of silver, aepresented above, is often mentioned in the scriptures and is referred to in the degree While it was worth less than twenty-five cents in our currency, yet Masonic tradition proves that no amount is insignificant in the face of urgent need, The Degree of Past Master For many years this degree was confeired upon those who had served as Maslers of Masonic lodges In some states this piactice is still maintained, yet in America, with probably one exception, it is conferred upon all those who have attained the degree of Mark Master In English lodges the degree is known as that of Installed Master There is no Past Master de - gree in English, Scottish or Irish chapters The degree deals primarily with administration, retaining some of the old instruction once given to those who were actually chosen to preside The gavel is very properly used as the emblem of this degree because it has very generally been accepted as an emblem of power. The gavel is used in all deliberative bodies today, more as a means of calling for order, than of demonstrating the power vested in its use, The degree teaches the value of Harmony and Justice is xi"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Degree of Most Excellent Master. This is by far the most spectacular degree in all Freemasonry It is the only degree which brings forcibly to our attention the completion and dedication of King Solo - mon’s Temple, the very idea upon which all Masonic symbolism has been based In 1922 the degree was conferred in Convention Hall in Kansas City, Missouri The class numbered one thousand candidates There was a men’s chorus of two hundred voices, an orchestra of fifty pieces, and a proces - sional made up of five hundred It was estimated that nine thousand Royal Arch Masons were in attendance This serves to demonstrate the immense possibilities and value of the degree The degree is built around the emblem of the keystone and the great lesson conveyed is the necessity for things Spiritual. The Degree of Royal Arch Mason The climax of Ancient Craft Masonry and Masonic symbolism, it is a cumplete story of Jewish history during some of its darkest hours. While based upon the subject of love of Home and Country, yet its lessons are those of Service and Fortitude, It teaches the ultimate triumph of Truth over all foims of superstition and esror, proper re - spect for the Deity and his works, and the worship of the one true God, inder what - soever name he may be worshiped The apron of a Royal Arch Mason is that of the lodge Mason, with the exception that the border has become red, symbolizing the fervency and zeal which should actuate Man in his service to God and to Humanity The Degree of Royal Master.’ Believed by many to include in its ceremonies one of the most beautiful sections of Masonic ritual to be found in any degree. It fully explains many of the symbols of Freemasonry and conveys in a dramatic way an incident which occurred during the building of the Temple It teaches the great lesson of right living and the building here on earth of that supeistructure necessary for the erection of our spiritual temple The Holy Vessels are the proper symbols for this degree, for they were the work of one of the most skilled artisans of the day They teach the necessity of having perfect bodies and minds to house man’s immortal soul. The Degree of Select Master. The second in the series of three dramatic degrees conferred by the Council The degree ends with the great tradition which r~cos all through Freemasonry, and constitutes an ex - planation satisfactory in all details as to cer - tain traditional happenings, a knowledge ol which is necessary for a proper understand - ing of the Story of Freemasonry It teaches a wonderful lesson—that of overlooking the failings of those who through ignorance or curiosity may often overstep the bounds of propriety The Aik of the Covenant is the proper symbol of this degree Ita traditions, use, and symbolism are fully explained to the re - cipient of the degree, and those who do secrive the degree are truly Select Masters 52 is"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Degree of Super Excellent Master. Referred to by many as the most dramatic and impressive of all the degrees of Free - masonry Whinthri you agree or not, there is no question as to its historical and Masonic value, teaching a great lesson in Fidelity. While the scene of the degree is laid many centuries ago, the lessons portrayed are just as essential in the present age. The degree requires the largest cast of characters of any of the degrees, and ends with a climax never to be forgotten It teaches that while men may continue to build, the only permanent temple is that spiritual temple which each erects within himself The degree has its emblems, which are the Square, the Cir - cle, and the Triangle, the symboliem of which is fully explained to the initiate. The degree constrtutes the perfect drama, ex - emplifying one of the most tragic events in the history of the Jewish people. The Qider oj the Red Cross The Order has no connection with the American Red Cross. It is a degree—termed Order in ~ this series—connecting the Capituf at system of degrees (the Chapter) with the Chival - ric, or Templar system It continues the story of the Jewish people, from their dark - est hour to the time of the Rebuilding of the Temple. The lesson taught is that of Truth, which often crushed to earth will rise again, for in the end it is might and will prevail over all forms of error and superstit ion The Red Cross is trialy the emblem of this illustrious Order, for each of its four arms have important symbolic allusions The degree encourages the search for truth, and emphasizes the im - portance of Liberty and Justice, with a right to worship Deity under whatever name he may be called The Order of Malta The Order is strictly Christian in origin and character, and while there are no restrictions as to who may receive it, yet one who did not believe in the practice of Christian principles would be embarrassed in petitioning fox the Order. For its locale is laid among scenes and char - acters ref ei red to in the New Testament and it constitutes a Masonic interpretation along Christian lines of the New Dispensation The Order receives its name from the Island of Malts, whose name has been in the headlines from the period of the Crusades until the present day A Priory of Knights of Malta still exists on this ancient Isle The Maltese Cross is the proper emblem for this Order, for it was officially conferred upon the membership during the Cru - sades, and the modern Order in remembrance have perpetuated the symbol as standing for all that was true and holy, The Order of the Temple. Often referred to as Knight Templar, and the climax of the Christian Orders of Knighthood It still retains in its ritual sume of the ancient ceremonies of the original order Like the Order of Malta, it is founded upon the prin’ ciples enunciated in the New Testament, teaching that Love is the great characteristic of those who would aspire to immortality, Love which suflees long and is kind, Love which overcomes all hate and all difficulties and which will eventually in a time, we hope not too far distant, make of all mankand— Brothers The Order receives its name from those Crusaders who were swum to protect pilgrims and uphold the Cross, and who became the first Chris - tian protectors of Jerusalem, their exploits thrilling all Christen - dom for ages i4 5?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The true emblem of a Knight Templar is the Passion Cross.
