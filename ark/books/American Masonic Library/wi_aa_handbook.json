The present system of District Deputies and Area Administrators was developed in order to improve comm unications between our constituent lodges and the Grand Lodge and to str engthen the bond between them. For more specifics see Section C, Role of Area Administrators. 2. This handbook was prepared from material provided by all the Area Administrators who served the Grand Lodge. 3. The position of Area Administrator is key to the successfulness of Masonry in Wisconsin. He is the vital link between the Grand Lodge Officers and the individual lodge officers and members. An Area Administrator, who is properly prepared and motivated, can ma ke a great impact upon his lodges. 4. There is probably no one person w ho neither exhibits all of the characteristics described in Section G, nor complies totally with all of the duties listed in Section F. Neverthel ess, the brother who strives to incorporate as many of these as his own talents and characteristics will allow, will have a very positive effect upon the quality of Masonry in his area and he will find he has improved himself in the process. Each of us must use his individual talents. Similarly, each lodge situation is unique and will need different approaches, methods and programs. The successful Area Administrator will adapt different plans to different situations. 5. An Area Administrator should not be relu ctant to take initia tive, make visits, or do whatever he, in his own opin ion, believes is necessary to be done within his area. Criticism is much more likely to be bestowed upon him because of inactivity than over activity. When in real doubt, he should consult with his District Deputy. 6. Perhaps the most important attribut e a brother can bring to his task, as Area Administrator, is dedication. T he brother who tries will make an improvement and the number one role of the Area Administrator and for all Masons is to improve t he quality of Masonry. DEFINITION OF AREA The Grand Jurisdiction of Wisconsin is divided into Twelve Districts, which are further sub-divided into Administrative Areas consisti ng of from four to seven lodges. These areas may be altered from ti me to time for reasons of convenience and as experience dictates. The District and Area to which each lodge is assigned is listed in the directory of lodges published each year by the Grand Lodge "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 ROLE OF THE AREA ADMINISTRATOR Under the direction of the District Deputy, an effective Area Administrator will fulfill the following role: 1. Liaison between the lodges to whic h he has been assigned and the Grand Lodge. He should provide communication in both directions and be a goodwill ambassador. 2. An inspirational leader who instills the desire withi n the lodges to improve in all areas, and converts this desire into action.
